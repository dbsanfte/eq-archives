Soon would come the judgement of the one to whom he had sworn his spirit.  An oath he never truly regretted, though it set much of Norrath against him.  As a young warrior he had been proud to serve the Father and had immersed himself in the teachings of Hate.  But he had been cast out of the House of T’Ndrkalir and proclaimed a heretic and a traitor to Neriak.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I never betrayed my people or my oath to you.  I have followed your teachings all my life.  My only crime was that I found another path that could lead to the Tier’Dal dream.  Punish me for that if you will, Father, but do not deny or hide its existence.  Others have seen it”.  He remembered the House of Z’Asrithe.  They, to, had been called heretics and traitors.  “Even by me” he thought.<br>
<br>
For the thousandth time he wondered how the Tier’Dal could all be so blind.  “But then, would I have seen the path had I not decided to wander through the forest that day?” he asked himself.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sathar T’Ndrkalir breathed deeply, reveling in the dark fragrance of the Forest of Nektulos.  It had been three long and painful days since he had seen the world outside.  He had just recovered from the ceremony which marked his elevation to the Fifth Circle of the Seventh Sphere of Hate, that point that lesser races called the 35th season, or hunt, or any of a dozen other ridiculous references to describe their advancement in life.  His right arm still tingled where his on aged grandfather, the Patriarch of the T’Ndrkalir’s, had carved the Mark of the Father into his flesh.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He smiled with pride, and that certain touch of arrogance that had become his trademark, when he remembered the looks of shock as he proclaimed his future sacrifice.  “As a sign of my pledge to the Father and the Tier’Dal, I offer my first born child to the Father to use as He needs”.  No other T’Ndrkalir Shadow Knight, had ever dared to make this oath.  They knew, as did Sathar, that such a declaration would make their children a weapon for Innoruuk to wield against any who displeased him.  Even the Tier’Dal.  But Sathar had, long ago, sworn that his branch of this House would be the weapons of the Father.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The House of T’Ndrkalir had always believed in the supremacy of the Tier’Dal race, and that all other races existed only to serve the Chosen.  Even the Erudite heretics were only tolerated by many Tier’Dal because they were more useful than most of the other infidels.  The day would come when the lesser races would all bow before Innoruuk or be destroyed.  It was Sathar’s dream that his descendents would lead a new empire of the Tier’Dal.  For this reason alone had he made his pledge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His thoughts had caused him to wander far from the entrance to Neriak, and he noticed he was nearing the river which separated this land from the human plague that infested the Commonlands.  When he looked around to get his bearings, his eye caught a glimmer of something unfamiliar.  As he grew closer he noticed it was a body, not an unusual sight here in the forest.  What made this body different were two things.  One it was far from the paths traveled by most of the Tier’Dal and other travelers.  The other, this fool was still alive.<br>
<br>
He had met several Erudites over the span of his life, but this one was different.  She did not where the, long ago agreed upon, mark of the heretics on the back of her hand.  Moreover she seemed far more travel worn than most, appearing to have not eaten in quite some time.  “Well, with the wolves and spiders around here she will be dead soon enough” he thought.  He then began to search through her pack to see if there was anything of use to him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What he found surprised him.  Most of what she carried were scrolls and books.  There were very few magical reagents or spell components.  One of the books caught his attention, for the cover bore markings from several different cultures, including the Tier’Dal.  As he skimmed through the pages he noticed one reference was constantly being noted.  It was a single word, geomancy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Geomancy was supposed to be the magical art practiced by the long dead and lost Combine Empire.  They were the last great human power on Norrath.  There is little left to remind any of this once powerful people.  There is only one book in all of Neriak that bears any mention of them, and its contents are considered to be legends and myths.  Some of the Tier’Dal magical and religious councils believed, at one time, that geomancy was the magical art form practiced by the druids.  They had many times tortured captured druids trying to learn the secret, but had always failed.  They gave up trying long, long ago.<br>
<br>
Sathar wondered if this traveler was on the verge of discovering geomancy for herself.  If she was, and he could gain access to those lost powers, what glory and power he could bring to the children of Innoruuk.  If he could combine the necromantic arts with the geomantic arts of the druids he would carve his descendents place in the future of the Tier’Dal and be one step closed to his dream.  But to do that this fool Erudite must live.  He bundled her in his cloak and carried her back to his home.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the months that followed Danira Drk’Mun taught Sathar all she knew of the Combine Empire.  There was very little that pertained to the art of geomancy.  They spent long hours in the libraries of Neriak, searching through tomes so ancient that they would almost fall apart in their hands.  With each passing day they became more lost and frustrated.  But, while their frustration grew, so did their respect for each other.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If I had not stumbled on her that day, I might not be where I am now” he thought.  He also would never have known love and what it meant to be a father and a protector.  “Oh, Danira, forgive me for what my arrogance may have done to our son” he cried.  A cold, hollow laugh was his only answer.  In his anguish he drifted back to happier times. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We must leave Neriak, Sathar.  There are other libraries we must visit.  Perhaps the ones in Felwithe will contain the scrolls mentioned in the ancient texts of your people”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He laughed “Of course, by all means let us go there at once.  I may have a little trouble getting through the gate, as I recall the dwarves and elves of Faydwer do not care very much for the Tier’Dal”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But they did leave Neriak.  They had been traveling for some few weeks, and were nearing the human city of Qeynos, when Danira told him of a new idea.  “Why don’t we go to Surefall Glade?  I have been thinking that the best way to understand the geomantic arts is to study with the druids.  Perhaps I can become one of them.  Besides, we will need to stop traveling soon, at any rate”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why must we stop traveling?” he asked, pondering the concept of an Erudite druid and wondering what his life expectancy would be among the ranger of Surefall.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, in another few weeks it may be dangerous for me to travel.  Sathar, I carry your child”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He walked on for several more yards before the impact of her words penetrated his thoughts.  He stopped and slowly turned, a smile crossed his lips.  He took her in his arms and hugged her.  That night, beneath the stars of Norrath, he proclaimed his love for Danira and took her to wife, according to the ancient Tier’Dal rites.  As she slept, he wondered how they would ever get by in Surefall.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next day, as they were crossing into the Qeynos Hills, they saw a wood elf woman being attacked by bandits and gnolls.  There was a time when Sathar would have stood back and watched the one sided battle, and then destroyed the victor.  But his search of the ancient records revealed the one flaw in the Combine Empires design, it had no room for others with different ideas.  The Tier’Dal were like this to a large degree.  He had been learning tolerance of others and their ideals.  So this day he drew his weapons and waded into the battle, on the side of the elf woman.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Windwhisper was nearly dead by the time the battle was over.  Sathar and Danira had little experience with treating wounds as grave as were hers.  They built a litter for her and started toward Surefall.  The rangers allowed them to enter the glade only because they were aiding a Surefall resident.  They also permitted Sathar and Danira to remain while Windwhisper was recovering.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp During the recovery time, Danira approached the Jagged Pine druid council and, somehow convinced them to allow her to train in the druidic arts.  Sathar was never truly trusted or liked by the rangers, though he did fight beside them when they were attacked.  As a step toward gaining their trust, if not their friendship, he set aside his dark powers.  He vowed to never cast any of his shadow knight spells as long as he resided in Surefall.   He kept to that promise till the day he died.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the first snows of winter drifted down to coat the Qeynos Hills, the wailing cry of newborn announced the arrival of Sathar’s and Danira’s first child.  There was much discussion concerning his name as each parent wished to honor the other.  “Why not name the child after someone who has impacted both of your lives?” asked Winwhisper, who was their only true friend in all the glade.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After much thought they decided to name the child after the last ruler of the Combine Empire.  When they performed the ancient Tier’Dal naming ceremony, Elmoran cried out, thus announcing his acceptance of an ancient name.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The years passed, and the boy grew and learned the ways of the rangers.  He also learned of their fear and hatred.  He endured the bigotry of the glade folk in the manner of the Tier’Dal.  No one ever saw his tears, not even his parents.  Only Windwhisper knew of the torment which followed Elmoran where ever he went.  She knew that the day must come when he would strike back at these self-made enemies, and hoped she would not live to see it.  She hoped that the child she carried would never know the pain and loneliness that followed Elmoran.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then word came of an evil alliance between the Darkpaw gnolls of Black Burrow and the bandits of the Karana plains.  Within days they were attacking everywhere.  They had even tried to assault the gates of Qeynos.  Eventually the Darkpaw clan decided it was time for revenge against the folk of Surefall Glade and launched a massive attack.  There was no help to be had from Qeynos as they were still recovering from the assault by the gnolls and bandits.  So the rangers and druids gathered outside of the glade to defend their home.  With them, though there were those who tried to stop them, stood Sathar and Danira.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The battle raged for hours, with the dead and dying everywhere.  Sathar had restrained his natural battle lust and had fought without using his dark spells.  Proud of his self control, he looked toward his wife and smiled.  But the smile faded into an anguished cry of pain as Danira was cut down by a massive gnoll.  He recognized the visage of Trannix Darkpaw himself.<br>
<br>
  “Innoruuk guard me and guide my blades” he cried.  With tears of pain and loss streaming down his face, he reached out and the gnoll writhed in pain.  Sathar then stepped forward a thrust his sword into the gnolls body, lifting it from the ground and holding it aloft.  He cast other spells and more gnolls and bandits died in great pain.  As he cast Trannix’s twitching, lifeless form aside, an arrow struck him in the chest.  Then another, and another, and another.  He fought on, wondering where the gnolls had gotten Surefall arrows.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Those damned, useless, bigoted rangers.  They feared my power so much that they had to kill me lest I turn it on them next.  And then they had the stones to try and raise my son to be one of them.  Well, at least now he is away from there.  With a little luck he may find peace and love, like his mother and I.  I wish I could be there to guide him, tell him to seek out the path that I found”.<br>
<br>
“That old bastard Lokus was right.  The gods are as self serving as are the folk they created, and until we throw off their shackles we will be little better than slaves.  Maybe Elmoran will find Evoluxa some day and learn from them.  Then, perhaps, he will know the truth.  He has his destiny to realize, as I am about to realize mine”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah, Sathar, sorry to be away so long.  I had a small task that needed doing, a new weapon to unsheathe and set free in Norrath.  Thank you for the gift.  For that alone I may shorten your suffering.  But, then again, probably not”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sathar thought “Innoruuk loves to play with those he wishes to torment”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In a far off corner, Danira wept knowing there was nothing she, or anyone, could do to help her husband, or her son.<br>
