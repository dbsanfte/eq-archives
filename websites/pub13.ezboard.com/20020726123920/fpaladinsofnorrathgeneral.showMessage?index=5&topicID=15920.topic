Have someone cast a low level pet.  Just let it tap at you while you Cease and Desist cast on it.<br>

Have a Necro or SK summon a pet and have it lie down.  Then start to cast ward undead on it. <br>

Once I got IoN, I kept it up all the time... The proc it delivered gave me enough of an edge that I didn't try to follow up with other DD spells. Also, I had read somewhere else on this board an opinion that casting in the middle of a fight was bad for a paladin because you don't hit with your melee during casting. In the group I travel with most of the time, I am rarely if ever the puller (to pull with a spell). I guess I'm just the product of some ill advice and poor tactics on my part.<br>

Ok - I know this will sound unbelievable for level 49, but... stuns? (please don't laugh) Is that &quot;Cease&quot; and &quot;Desist&quot;? Can you please explain how those work to me?

Now you are rotating your stuns, and cease, should be back up.  Cease and Desist are your fastest stuns, for lowest mana, so I try to use those first.  I am not trying to do damage, just preventing mob from doing damage with spells.<br>
<br>
BUT:  In Trak's Teeth I was going up against the undead whatevers.  I stopped stunning all together, as they seemed to have a 1-second cast time, and I was just wasting mana.  My druid partner was keeping me alive, so I just saved my mana for later heals.  Seemed to be a more logical use of my mana.  I think in one battle the undead got off about ten spells, with me rotating my stuns, casting when I saw &quot;Soandso begins to cast a spell&quot; and sometimes before to try to beat him to the punch.  Ignoring stuns, Undead got off about 8 spells....cause I was hitting him so much I guess.<br>
<br>
If you are not main tank, then just chain stun all the casters.  I know that in SOL B, the NOBLE never got a charm off on me, as I would just chain cast and tank.  In my time there, I must have made 2000 plat from the Noble alone.  (love that staff of his and my CHARISMA addiction)<br>

<br>
Interrupting spell casters is one of our biggest jobs in the high end game. It's important at lower levels too, but it becomes more so when to get 50+. With Cease, Desist, and Stun, you can be a top notch spell interrupter and royal pain in the butt to all caster NPC's, hehe.<br>
<br>
Whenever you get into a fight with a spell casting NPC, pull out the shield and one hander so you can bash (unless you're soloing and your one hander does a lot less damage than your 2 hander...even then it's kind of a judgement call. Until I got my Fiery Avenger I had a Wurmy and shield for my 1hs / shield set up and an Arbitor's Combine Greatsword for my 2 hander, and after a while I gave up bashing with the shield and pulling out the Wurmy when I was soloing because it did so much less damage than the ACGS and I could still interrupt most spells with stuns and the mob died much quicker with the ACGS).<br>
<br>
You should have 3 stuns memmed for spell interruption; Cease, Desist, and Stun. Make a hot button called STUN and set it up like this:<br>
<br>
/cast 1<br>
/cast 2<br>
/cast 3<br>
<br>
This is assuming your stuns are memmed in the first 3 available slots in the top of the bank of spells. If not just substitute the appropriate spell slot numbers, but for now lets assume they're in the first 3 slots.<br>
<br>
Put Cease in the first slot, always. It's one of the fastest casting (1.5 seconds) and the lowest mana cost (15) stuns. In the other 2 slots put Desist and Stun; placement of these is a bit more debatable as you need to decide whether saving mana is more important to you (Desist is only 25 mana but Stun is 60) or having a better chance to get the spell off in time is more important (Desist has a casting time of 1.8 seconds but Stun is only 1.5). I personally have Cease, then Stun, then Desist, as with most of the mobs I'm fighting interrupting every spell is much more important and mana cost isn't such a big deal.<br>
<br>
The beauty of this hot button is that it will always attempt to cast Cease first. If you have already used this button in a fight and Cease is still grayed out it will move to the next stun and attempt to cast that. If that stun has also been used in the last few seconds and is unavailable, it will move to the 3rd stun and attmept to cast that. Using this method you should always have at least one stun available at any given time. Also you can hover your mouse over one button, and as you soon as you see the &quot;target begins to cast a spell&quot; message you can very quickly click to interrupt.<br>
<br>
Interrupting spells is all about shaving off tenths of a second so you can get that bash or stun off before the mob completes its spell. So, general idea is to try to bash first to instantly interrupt, then cast a stun if the bash misses. You can either do this as 2 separate actions, or combine the bash into your STUN hot button to do it all at once:<br>
<br>
/doability (whichever number slot your bash button is in in your bank of combat buttons on the right side of your screen)<br>
/cast 1<br>
/cast 2<br>
/cast 3<br>
<br>
The good part about this button is that by hovering your mouse over this button in a fight and hitting it as soon as you see the spell casting message, you're interrupting spells in the absolute fastest (and therefore most successful) way. The negative aspect to this is that you're casting a stun every time without checking to see if your bash interrupted the spell and made the stun unneccesary, and thereby wasting mana. However, if you do it this way you can hit hit D twice and your autoattack button again to resume fighting. This will make you duck, then stop ducking, then start attacking again because when you ducked it turned autoattack off.<br>
<br>
I prefer to keep bash and stun as 2 separate buttons, that way I don't have to interrupt my own stuns when a bash hits, but some paladins like them all as one button, it depends on your style of play.<br>
<br>
A word of warning...when you start chain stunning, the mobs will REALLY dislike you and go right after you. This is why paladins (along with sk's, for other reasons) have a reputation for being very good at aggro management, they can pull a mob off a caster faster than anybody else, with the possible exception of SK's, by making the mob hate them more than the caster. This is good news if you're main tank in your group, not oso good if you're not. This is also the reason why I don't have my stun button set up to include bashes, as I don't want to accidentally stun when I don't need to and draw excess aggro if I'm not the MT.<br>
<br>
Also, repling to your earlier comment about stopping attacking while casting spells: not true. The timer that counts off in between your sword swings is NOT reset when you cast spells. So, to maximize your potential as a spells casting melee, try to cast spells JUST AFTER a sword swing. If the casting time of the spell is less than the delay of your weapon (adjusted for any haste items or spells you might have on you), you will have no loss of speed in your attack. Stunning to gain aggro is a typical thing to use this method for. However, this strategy goes out the window when you're stunning to interrupt spells of course, then you just want to get the stun off as fast as possible. <p>Deezle Suture -

I.e. casting stun just after seeing the &quot;npc begins to cast&quot; message works great - *if* you don't have a laggy connection.  With a lot of lag, I sometimes just continuously rotate the stuns, but this uses more mana and is less effective.  A simple clarity I pretty much keeps my mana up when doing this, however.<br>
<br>
I have just started to group in Seb, and I can sometimes keep the caster frogs from getting off more than a couple spells a fight.  The difference between doing this or not is reflected in the health-bars of the group (or the amount of mana burned by the cleric).  The amount Paladins contribute to the health and efficiency of a group in this fashion is quite impressive, IMHO.<br>

I find I can still shut down casting mobs very efficiently.  I use Cease, Stun, and Holy Might as my stuns.  I also find that I can shut down most blue mobs for about 2/3 of a fight chain casting Stun and Holy Might.  If I have a clarity, and am not pulling I can do this fairly continuously.  This reduces the amount of damage the mobs do considerably.  It also increases the number of hunting options available to whatever group I am in.<br>
<br>
Cracked myself up the other day.  I was in a group with an enchanter and two 60th level warriors in Akheva Ruins.  As a lark, we decided that I would tank so they could focus on damage instead of aggro control.  I was able to keep aggro over 80% of the time, and still keep most of the mobs from hitting well over half the time from stuns.  We didn't have a cleric, but were still able to keep an impressive kill rate going because we weren't taking much damage.  The chanter was 60, so I had KEI, and the mobs were slowed and tashed, which helped a lot.  It was a lot of fun trying to out taunt 2 warriors 6 levels higher than me though.  Anyway, stuns are a BIG part of our arsenal.<br>

<br>
I had evocation at 9 at level 27, then I went to unrest and got the skill up to 100 or so. Then with the level 30 stun, mine evocation is maxed at every level very quickly. (Don't have cesist, desist, back then and didn't find much use for that undead dd, til I got to unrest)<br>
<br>
Keep practicing it, as you WILL have use for it. Also new spells tend to fizzle more, as you level up, even with the same skill level, you will fizzle less.<br>

So the mob isn't actually &quot;stunned&quot;.  It's pretty much like bash.<br>
Stun, Holy Might, Force, Words of Tranquility are your stuns.  Those will actually stop the mob from doing anything for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
My suggestion is that you load up cease, desist and stun.  Get a Clarity or C2(C3 if you're lucky) and chain stun a moss snake or something hehe.  Or chain stun someone's pet.  (not sure if NPC's will agro you if you cast on a pet)  <br>
<br>
You definately wanna max your evocation, alteration and abjuration.  (Divination too.. so you don't fizzle on IVU at the wrong time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) <p><font size = 1 color=white><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168892>Baron Dvarian, 60th Warder of Povar</b></font>

<br>
When playing my paladin, and the ranger in my group pulls, I use a quick Cease to pull aggro onto me, and turn the mob in my direction.  It stops walking for a full second.  Desist is just over a second, maybe two?  It also does not attack.<br>
<br>
As an example... When the paladin was level 25ish, we were grouped in Warsliks Woods at the Giant fort.  The ranger would pull two up to the south-eastern corner hill.  I'd root one at the max root range, and hit the second with Cease.  I'd almost instantly be getting beat on.  <br>
<br>
Similarly, I've been doing this the last couple nights in Eastern Wastes doing Ulthorks and Rhinos.  Ranger pulls past the rogue, I Cease/Desist/Stun, one two three, and the rogue gets off some crit throws while I get in front of the mob and start meleeing.  During this time, the only damage I take is from a riposte.  So for a full 4 seconds or so, I take no damage, and the mob goes down ten percent or more.  (Well except for Rhinos.)<br>
<br>
If you need to, test it yourself... Go up to an orc pawn or whatever, and pull it with a bow or a higher casting stun (nondamage).  As it runs to you, hit it with Cease.  Bam, it stops for a second, then heads after you.<br>
<br>
I also use it for ghetto crowd control.  I Cease/Desist/Stun adds, and either I, the cleric, or the ranger will root it.  Move over a bit, cleric Atones, bam.  Ghetto mez.<br>

I basically meant that it's like bash... a &quot;short&quot; stun.<br>
I usually use Cease to pull since it's a quick cast and the mob isn't stunned for 3 seconds or whatever the spell &quot;Stun&quot; does.  Haven't used Desist a whole lot.<br>
