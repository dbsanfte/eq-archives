(Beggars too!)</span><hr size=1> When I first obtained the all powerful &quot;SOW&quot; as a young druid I cast it with pride on just about anyone. If someone asked for sow, no problem!  It seems however, that the masses have wore me down at long last.<br>
<br>
I now have a level 30 druid and I am so SICK of being everyones walking vending machine I could scream at times.<br>
<br>
I was in Freeport tonight minding my own business practing brewing and within about an hour. half the damn zone had sent me tells much like this:<br>
<br>
    Buff me plz<br>
    SoW me plz<br>
    I need a port<br>
<br>
One conversation went like this:<br>
<br>
Newbie:  Can you help me plz?<br>
Me:  What do you need?<br>
Newbie:  Take me to Kaladim<br>
Me:  Why don't you just go to EFP and take the boat?<br>
Newbie:  You can just zap me over there<br>
Me:  Sorry I'm working on trade skills right now I'm busy<br>
Newbie: Plz<br>
<br>
Finally I said ooc &quot;Can a woman do trade skills in peace without being accosted by every Tom, Dick, and Harry for sow, buffs, ports, and hand outs???&quot;<br>
<br>
I was in G-fay one day and announced porting for donations and this newb sent me a tell asking for a port to Butcherblock!  I asked him why he just didn't walk there and he complained about it taking to long he wanted ME to port him there and then when I did it he ran off stiffing me on the bill.<br>
<br>
Excuse my language but WTF!!!<br>
What is it with these damned newbs?  When I was a newb, I didn't even THINK about getting a port unless I was trying to get from NK to WC or visa versa.  I walked my bum off. These people want you to port them to WC from FP for nothing.  Oh yes, I'll port you, spend my time zoning and running all the way back to the city for jack squat.  Now don't get me wrong, I will port for free for those genuinely in need like a true newb who offers me 2pp because that's the best he can do for for a CR if I'm free, but I'll be damned if I will port their sorry arse 2 or even 1 zone away just so I can spend my time running back.<br>
<br>
And lastly, ever since I hit mid 20s on my druid, I must get anywhere from one to five tells a day begging me for items/money.  I have a 30 cleric that rarely gets beggers.  What is it about a druid that makes people think we're here to twink the hell out of them? <br>
<br>
Newb:  I'm a poor lv 1 can u plz give me stuff<br>
Me:  Oh sure, here take the 1k pp I have in the bank that I spent months working to save up, and while you're at it let me take the shirt off my back.  This PBB is nice, here, take it.  Do you see anything else you want?<br>
<br>
Again I have no problem with helping a newb who is actually trying to earn their way but I'd rather pour salt in an open wound then give a begger a single copper.  What I really want to do is get some of those ports to places like GD and Skyfire and port those beggers there and leave them to the fury of the mobs. <br>
<br>
Well I'm done ranting I realize this was long but I've finally reached my breaking point.  When someone walks up directly in my face and gives me &quot;the look of sow/buff/port me&quot; I just cringe inside.  Not all the time, but quite often because they're usually asking while i'm grouped, doing my business at the bank, running through town, getting my corpse, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
The beggars have forced me into annonymity so it's back underground before they catch me here.  <br>
<br>
Take care and I welcome responses!<br>

I got my epic tonight..<br>
<br>
Right before the Fay battle I was asked for a port..<br>
<br>
I find taking the time to explain what your often helps.. but Not always, /ignore helps often in those cases.<br>

Generally aren't &quot;real&quot; newbies. They're players who know enough about the game to have become lazy. They've done the newbie thing once before and don't really want to do it again, but DO want to have an alternate character with some levels under their belt. <br>
<br>
The magic word is no. Just say no and get on with your business. You don't have an obligation to port them, if they say &quot;it's your job&quot; then ask them why you're not getting a paycheck.<br>
<br>
Also, &quot;porting for donations&quot; generally makes it sound like you'll port them no matter what. Donation makes people think paying for the port is optional. Better to advertise &quot;Porting for plat&quot; or &quot;Porting for a fee&quot; than to imply that payment is optional and get upset when someone doesn't pay for the service.<br>
<br>
Also, if the tells have gotten you that frustrated, /anon or /roleplay. They work wonders.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/userberus00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Serberus00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/21/01 4:25:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbs who want a port to one zone away...</span><hr size=1> i've had two druids to 45, one I refused to be anonymous simply because I didn't think it was really necessary, but the second I was trying to level as fast as possible and decided I could do without the tells for buffs n ports.<br>
<br>
Being anon has dropped my requests by about 90%, the only time anyone ever asks for a buff or a port is if they see me and realise i'm a druid, so the next step is to just buy a parrying dagger and be that dual wielding ranger. The fact that I run around in Wolfform most of the time doesn't really help hide my identity though, thats the beauty of hunting in completely obscure and out of the way places.<br>
<br>
I personally can't stand to be in any zone with newbie hunting grounds now simply because everyone who sees you begs for buffs.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to buff people who don't ask, i.e. someone hunting skeletons at the BB druid ring, but it annoys me intensely, especially when you get that newb who stands infront of you while your at the bank and you dread the next 10 seconds of your life just hoping that the nearest summoning mob decides he doesn't like you.<br>
