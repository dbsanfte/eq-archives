She had read all the book of love and the poetry of the masters, and songs were no problems.  But she had never felt the stirrings of passion.  Xanthala was patient as she explained things, but sometimes the girl was confused.  <br>
<br>
Xanthala covered many topics in the first two days.  She talked about courtly love and the love in books that are made up.  She discussed the fact that marriage laws differ in areas of the world.  But she kept talking about passion in the world, a passion that the girl had never experienced.  So, it was hard to comprehend.  <br>
<br>
But today’s discussion was the reason that Brenton had picked Xanthala.  “Ok dearling, now you learn an important lesson.  In this world are many men that will take advantage of a beautiful young woman such as you.  Our lady teaches that love is given in many different ways.  But to give your body without your heart would displease her greatly.”<br>
<br>
“Sex and love can be separate entities, and you do not have to be emotionally involved to give your body to a man, but your body is yours and you should learn to love it and respect it.  You will never do that if you cheapen by allowing just any man to have it.”  <br>
<br>
She smiled at the young bard seeing her confusion, “Your body and the pleasure it can bring are a wonderful gift.  You can offer a man pleasure and warmth, comfort and desire, all within the shelter of your arms.”<br>
<br>
Xanthala patted her hand, “The Goddess gave you a gift in making you a woman.  Men will go to war for you and die for you if you are strong.  If you are weak they will use you and discard you.  Your heart must always remain true to the Goddess and yourself first.”<br>
<br>
Her dark eyes grew distant; “Once when I was younger I wanted to share myself with a young lordling in our land.  He promised me all types of things and I only had to give him my innocence.  I believed him and even though I didn’t love him, I was tired of being just another girl in the village.” <br>
<br>
She sighed and shook her head as if to shake away a cloud, “I slept with him in the hayloft of a barn and two days later he would not even talk to me.  He told his friends and all of a sudden men in the village were wanting me to bed them too.”<br>
<br>
“I had fallen for the oldest story in history and was a fool.  I left the village and explored the lands and found that many women were treated the same way and ended up nothing more than cheap and tawdry.” The bard wrinkled up her nose in disgust,  “I refused to allow myself to fall into that trap and decided to make a change.  <br>
<br>
Xanthala ran fingers through her long red hair, “I found a man that I liked and admired and who had great experience with women.  I didn’t love him, and he knew that, but I wanted to learn from him.  I cared for him and let him teach me how to please a man.  I knew it wasn’t a permanent relationship; I just wanted to learn how to use my body well.  <br>
<br>
“I spent a few months with him and one night had a dream of the Lady.  She told me that using a man was no better than him using me and that if I didn’t leave soon I never would.”  She smiled to herself, “I woke the next morning and told him I was leaving.  He begged me not to go and offered to make me his wife.  But that was not what I wanted.”<br>
<br>
“I left his company and went to the nearest temple to share my life and passion with the followers of the Lady.  So, here I am… and girls like you are the reason I am here.”  <br>
<br>
Smiling down to the girl, she gets down on her knees and looks her in the eyes, “If you really want to give your body to someone without marriage follow my advice.  Find a man you care about who is experienced.  Make sure that if you aren’t in love that you can walk away someday or you will be unhappy.  Have him show you all the things we have discussed.  Learn to pleasure him and have him pleasure you.”<br>
<br>
“The Lady’s gifts of pleasure and love are a strong gift.  Never cheapen the gift and it will always serve you well.”  She took her hand and led her back to the temple from the garden, not saying another word, letting her lesson sink in.<br>
