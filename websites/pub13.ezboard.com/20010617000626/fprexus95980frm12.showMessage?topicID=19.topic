<br>
That cleric who completed that quest had to be THE cleric of the server in order to complete that monstrosity. I am certainly not going to put myself through that agony, not without losing a few levels helping others to get THEIR quest items. It is just insane! (But hey, I am a cleric, the good thing is that we don't have to crave for magical items).<br>

Laureli did this epic with support from her guild.

The information on that geocities link is also available at Allakhazam's: <br>

One of these sites might grow and add info.  I just printed out the one on Allakhazam's, and it was 12 pages long.  *sigh*   Maybe I should have printed it in 4-pt letters; then it might not have been so dishearenting<br>

I hope those of you who are working on the quest can post here soon after you finish each step, and fill in some more details -- how difficult, how many assisted you, how long it took, what you did right, what you did wrong, etc.<br>

Update for everyone.<br>
<br>
The Burgurgle camp:<br>
 can be as long as 14 hours...takes a druid to pop in and kill the PH to make this camp sane.  when he pops, just run a couple people down there to take him down, then the fire elemental on the shore.  bing, bang boom.<br>
<br>
The Gimblox camp:<br>
Another bogus camp...up to 14 hours also is the longest continous camp I have heard of.  You can sit in the room on the south side and clear the PH's in the room with a single wiz or a couple of peeps.  Long and boring...kill the king next door or PL some middle 20 guys in the room while your there to pass the time.<br>
<br>
Ixiblat Fer:<br>
Tough fight...chance of have the Cloak of Flames drop so you can usually get people to come to help.<br>
<br>
Overking:<br>
Haven't done this yet.  Nice thread on the cleric board about some strategies.  This will be the toughest fight.<br>
<br>
Zordak:<br>
Looks like 24 hour spawn after Naggy, then a random 12-72 hour spawn after the dragon version of Zordak dies.  Was with Clubberlang on this fight...went well...several LD's and the corpse poofed, but the GM finished the quest with him.  Basic Naggy fight +10% or so.  But easier since you can have all level peeps in there with you.  Since the dragon scales drop off of this battle, another easy battle to get peeps to come to.<br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>

I started the quest a few days ago (finally!).<br>
Went to Lake Rathetear to see if there was anyone camping Lord Bergurgle.  There was.  I believe she had been there, soloing the placeholders, for four to six hours.  It wasn't her first time camping there, either.<br>
<br>
She was relying on Enduring Breath in order to stay underwater, and had to run off at regular intervals to get hers refreshed.  I wouldn't recommend that at all.  I suggest you beg, borrow, or buy a Fishbone Earring.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=1925">eqdb.allakhazam.com/item.html?item=1925</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Effect Enduring Breath, doesn't even need to be clicked, and will come in very handy when you go on Kedge raids.<br>
<br>
So anyway...<br>
Lord Bergurgle lives in a cave underneath the small island in the northeast corner of Lake Rathetear.  The tunnel entrance faces east toward the zone to Rathe Mountains, the /loc being pos2820 neg940.  You swim into the tunnel and keep going straight.  (Bergurgle's /loc is about pos2780 pos140.)  Even with my clipping plane up the max, I couldn't see far in front of me.  Once I cleared the tunnel, I could see a square sort of tower.  Standing on the rim of this tower, I could look down inside, where there were two deepwater goblins, one in the left corner, one in the right.  The goblins are supposed to be low-thirties.  They don't assist, but they do heal Lord Bergurgle.  If you kill them, they respawn in a few minutes.  Not sure of the respawn time, but it's less than the PH/Bergurgle time, so they may be back by the time he spawns.  Their healing range is prodigious, too.<br>
<br>
The placeholder spawns between them, every twenty-eight minutes.  The cleric who was camping the spawn when I arrived had been soloing him for hours.  She'd nuke and he'd go over the edge of the tower and blasting after her; I'm not sure where she was pulling him to.  The first time I pulled him he shot me with arrows, interrupting every single attempt to nuke because the arrow would slide me backward through the water, the equivalent of taking a step, I think.  So I went up to the island above to try to fight him.  From there he was getting some very large heals from below.  I should have pulled him to the nearest land to begin with.  If anyone else was soloing him and can add better advice, please do.  My solution:  my wonderful guildmate Satoru arrived to help me.  Thanks so much, hon!<br>
<br>
Lord Bergurgle spawned after three hours.  Goodness, was I lucky.  He was blue to me, and I read that he's level 45 or so.  I could not have soloed him, I don't care what anyone says.  (Okay, I'm not a Battling Cleric.)  Satoru pulled him, and then we discovered a blunder I had made:  we hadn't rehearsed which exit to take, and he went out the west tunnel while I went out the east tunnel.  I didn't even know there was a west tunnel.  It exited 2/3 of the way to the Arena, and my monkey friend had to hold him while I swam there.  Satoru killed him with very little difficulty, I believe.  Or maybe he just made it look easy.  ;-)<br>
<br>
When we got that much done I was too tired to go on.  The next step is to turn in the crown to Schmendrik Lavawalker, whose house is at pos3170 pos200.  By the way, the crown looks nifty when you equip it, but the stats aren't anything to brag about. <p>Ismena

<br>
Lord B is a pain simply because you have to be underwater the whole time.  He and his ph are on a 29 minute spawn which is a little on the slow time.  The suggestion to get a fishbone earring, while a good one, may not be practical for everyone.  An alternative suggestion is to obtain a bunch of water stones from a friendly magician.  I had good luck in the Rathe Mountains zone where most of the people were happy to summon a bunch in exchange for buffing their pets. I spent about 12 hours on this camp.<br>
<br>
The tactic I used for Lord B himself and his placeholders, was to swim up to the very top of the tower being careful not to aggro the gobs at the base of the tower, get a target, then swim back out to the nearest wall and then back down to the base (I find it easier to find at ground level even underwater).  I then cast a nuke to pull him, and then immediately cast a root as soon as possible.  Most times he got rooted before getting close enough to hit me.  Then just keep nuking away till dead.  I recommend having your stuns online, as occasionally, you'll get a healer and you'll need to interrupt the spell.  This advice pertains doubly to Lord B, as he can complete heal himself.  The arrow-shooting is a bit of a pain, but I never found it to be too much of a problem -- if you're having trouble getting a nuke off just cast a stun or two to give you some time to get your spell off.<br>
<br>
Lord G was simply boring.  At least on the Lord B camp I'd occasionally get exp at my level (somewhere around 48 or 49 at the time).  Just keep his spawn room and the room next door (opposite of the king side) clear of any healers and it'll be a piece of cake.  I wasted 14 hours or more on this spawn.<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, is the plasmatic priest.  When I asked for volunteers one night, we ended up with 10 people 7 were 52 or higher, 1 was 50 (me - cleric), and the other 2 tanks were in their mid 40's.  I suspect we could taken him easily enough with just one balanced group of 50-somethings, but it never hurts to have a little extra firepower.  We had the groups wait at the entrance to the Temple zone right where it narrows down to head out.  I was the only one up top with the priest when I handed him the statue.  After he spawned at 9am, I cast DA on myself, handed him the statue, he changed into the plasmatic priest, then started to attack and cast on me (the DA was definitely a smart move).  I ran down the stairs, hopped the railing to the bottom floor and then ran to the entrance.  It took him a bit, but he did manage to find us and didn't drag anything else with him.  We fought him real close to the entrance and didn't get any additional aggros on him at all due to his AE spells (in fact he didn't get many spells off at all once the 2 groups started hitting him).  Was actually an easy fight with the people we had.  Very little healing was needed.<br>
<br>
Now I find myself faced with defeating both Ixiblat Fer and Bathezid Di'Zok.  I don't think I can generate enough firepower for these guys within my own guild alone, so perhaps if there's others catching up to this spot, we can work together to take these fellas down. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uismena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ismena</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/01 5:33:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric Epic</span><hr size=1> bump <p>Ismena

<br>
Well, I will just say these: the battle between Shmendrik and Natasha was rather sedate; Cunner's pet (I think he had an earth elemental up, but it's been a while so I don't remember) made mincemeat out of the spirit of flame; and I am very glad I didn't try to solo anything.  One mistake and you start over.<br>
<br>
Swimming down to Omat Vastsea was no fun, even with swimming maxed at 200.  Thank eqatlas.com for a good map.  <br>

I did nothing else on this quest till this afternoon when my guild held a Chardok raid.  I know, I've jumped ahead several steps, but ya can do that.  I had never been to Chardok I must say that if I were not so grateful to everyone who pitches in and helps on these things, I would never go back again.  I hated it.  Awulfie, tell me what you see in it, please.<br>
<br>
Here's a map:<br>

I didn't have anything to do with organising the raid, I was just towed along, so I doubt I can offer any helpful details.  We had a large number of people -- six or seven groups, I'm sure, nearly all of us 50+ -- and one of the best pullers on the server, Nasir.  Obviously I'm not posting much that's useful; I'm only putting this here to beg that someone post more info here if they know about leading and organising Chardok raids.<br>
