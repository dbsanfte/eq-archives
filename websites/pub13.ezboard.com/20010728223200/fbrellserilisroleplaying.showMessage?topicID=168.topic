That bright sunny morning Al`kabor went to his storage chest and gathered his robe, staff, spell book, and a few other wizard items. Al'kabor learned from the messenger that there was a survivor of this shipwreck. The survivor's name was Tillerman Janck. There was only one problem. Al`kabor only heard rumors of where he may now be, so he knew he would need help finding Tillerman, for he was the only one who knew exactly where this wreckage was. Al`kabor decided that he would find aid in the great city of Qeynos. <br>
When Al`kabor arrived to the great city of Qeynos, rumor has it the old powerful wizard's voice boomed through the halls of the great stone city of Qeynos as he called for the help of six brave ones. Brave ones...just like many of you. Al`kabor mentioned that he needed help of at least a ranger and an enchantress after some time, six brave ones did agree to help Al`kabor. They were not quite sure why, but when Al`kabor calls upon people, many do try to aid. Al`kabor explained that the six brave ones could have whatever was on this wreckage, except for one item which Al`kabor would not name, which he badly wanted. Al`kabor calls upon people as 'minions' to put it mildly, very to the point he is. Al`kabor did explain that he learned that this Tillerman was rumored to be somewhere in the Commons. So, they all set out just as it began to rain on the path to the Commonlands. <br>
Upon arriving at the Commons, the ranger did begin to use his skills in the ways of tracking to find signs of disturbance of leaves and such. The ranger did indeed lead them to a man whom was gathering berries. Upon hailing him and some introduction it was indeed Tillerman Janck. The brave ones and Al`kabor explained how they dearly wanted him to lead them to the wreckage. Tillerman however made it very clear he wanted nothing to do with the Ocean again, as he now feared water, hence his moving to the Commons. Well, it did take MANY ales to persuade Tillerman to aid them but alas he did cave in and agree to lead them to the wreckage. <br>
So, the next day, after some rest Tillerman, Al`kabor, and the six brave ones set out for the Ocean of Tears. It was a fall day, the leaves brown the smell of the grasslands. Upon reaching the shoreline Tillerman began to tremble with fear. He began to walk backwards slowly away from the group and shore. Indeed it was apparent that panic filled his heart and mind. Alas the enchanter in the group smiled softly and began to cast some kind of enchantment. Tillerman became calm. The enchanter did again cast another spell upon the party and Tillerman as well. They no longer felt the need to breathe air like mortals. The enchantress began to cast this enchantment upon Al`kabor as well but he smiled bitterly soft, calmly interrupted the enchantress and taped to his earring. He said &quot;No need, I have my powers with this. <br>
Tillerman began to wade into the water leading the six brave ones and Al`kabor down deep...deep into the murky waters. Then something began to appear from the depths. It was a hull or what was left of it. Then something else happened. The waters began to swirl violently around them. Something was not right. Then it happened all to fast The truth from the wreckage long ago began to unfold to rapidly. You see friends, twas not storm nor rock nor pirate that caused the wreck that day but an ancient evil water elemental. It was there to guard its claim from long ago. You see, it must have been the case where Tillerman was knocked from the boat and knocked out cold into the water. The God's did watch over him that day. He floated to shore and there the Sisters did take him in. <br>
So there they were. The ancient elemental ranged forth a great wave of attack on Al`kabor, Tillerman, and the heroes. A great battle, of what some say was epic broke out. Al`kabor and the heroes...casting, fighting, and healing...side by side. Much like many of you have proven well in battle. Then the waters calmed. Alas it was over. The heroes and Al`kabor had WON! Al`kabor immediately went to search the hull of the wreckage then he produced something. A parchment...a simple parchment friends. Then Al`kabor slightly trembled something rare for such a man of his power. He muttered &quot;The Kedge...it is true....The Kedge&quot;. He hastily stuffed the parchment into a pocket of his robe. He then noted a wooden chest in the corner. Alas the wood chest was brought to the heroes. They swam back to shore Tillerman shivering and a bit grumpy behind them. The warrior of the six brave ones brought his sword down upon the wooden chest. In it there was numerous gems, fine weapons, and magic scrolls. With that, Al`kabor hastily thanked the brave ones, and Tillerman as he cast a gate spell and disappeared.<br>
<br>
Tis unknown where Al`kabor went to for the rest of that day but that ended his journey for the day and so ends my tale.<br>
