<br>
(note - a lot of my questing details are OPINIONS and a lot of this can be done in a different order)<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
There are two components to the Fiery Defender -<br>
<br>
The Fiery Avenger, and the mark of atonement.<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
F I E R Y  A V E N G E R--<br>
<br>
The Fiery Avenger is started in the Plane of Sky (technically) though I don't recommend going to Plane of Sky until you have all the items needed for your weapon.  This quest isn't for the weak of heart, and not many paladins have even the fiery avenger.  To receive your weapon, Inte Akera (detailed instructions later) requires FOUR (4) items.  The Blessing of Sacrifice (Ghoulbane), the Blessing of Nobility (Soulfire), Head of Miragul, Robe of Miragul.  Details to obtain each -- <br>
<br>
Step One - Ghoulbane<br>
<br>
The Ghoulbane can be obtained off the Froglok Shin Lord in Upper Guk.  Maps can be found here - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">www.eqmaps.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Race, Class: Froglok, PAL<br>
Level Range: 35ish<br>
Hit Points: 1200<br>
Hits For: 50 - 98<br>
Monetary Loot: Copper to gold<br>
Special Attack: None<br>
Spawn Time: 17 minutes<br>
Magical weapon not required.<br>
<br>
The Ghoulbane is a relatively long camp, unless you are lucky.  The Froglok Shin Lord has the statistics listed above.  He drops the Silver-Plated Bracer as common loot, and the Ghoulbane as rare.  It appears as a Fine Steel Two Handed Sword in his hands.  When he gets a bit lower than half health, he'll lay hands on himself.  An easy solo fight for a paladin in his Fiery Avenger level range.<br>
<br>
The Ghoulbane is required for the Blessing of Sacrifice.  (see above)<br>
<br>
Step Two - SoulFire<br>
<br>
A bit tougher to obtain than the Ghoulbane, but much more fun, because it is a quest, not a camp.<br>
<br>
To obtain SoulFire, the items you need are-<br>
<br>
1) The Hilt<br>
<br>
The Hilt is dropped off of Xicotl in Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
Type: MOB<br>
Race, Class: TRL, SHD<br>
Level Range: 38 - 41<br>
Hit Points: 2110<br>
Hits For: 90s<br>
Monetary Loot: Copper to Platinum<br>
Special Attack: Harm Touch<br>
Spawn Time: 20ish minutes, with placeholders<br>
Magical weapon not required.<br>
<br>
When I did my SoulFire quest (god so long ago), I couldn't solo him at 50.  Bring companions if you're not 55ish.  Xicotl has a placeholder, named a mistmoore guard.  She's REALLY weak (dervish cutthroat level).  One slash. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       My hilt took me a while (6ish hours), but I've heard of people getting lucky.  /shrug<br>
<br>
2) Brilliant Sword of Faith<br>
<br>
This item requires a raid consisting of about two-three groups unless you're high level.  (I've helped numerous low paladins do this part and it's quite easy for me, I'm 56, nearly 57).<br>
<br>
The Testimony of Truth, dropped off of Sir Lucan Dlere, is turned into Valeron Dushire in North Freeport at the Paladin Guild for this sword.<br>
<br>
The strategy I use and recommend to kill Lucan is this (note, keep your raid party at the south wall next to the zone)-<br>
<br>
Synopsis of battle/pull-<br>
Pull to assigned spot (away from everyone)<br>
Non-KoS person hails Lucan to keep him there<br>
Pull Lucan to raid when he's by himself<br>
Kill<br>
Paladin loots<br>
<br>
When I do my Lucan raids for brother/sister Paladins, I pull Lucan.  He's located in the Militia House, the first red building as you enter Freeport.  Go through the door, to the left, and go through two doors.  He's standing at a desk.  I attack him, run out with divine aura (beware of the uber guards) to a cactus at the north wall with Lucan in tow.  The non-kos person targets Lucan, hails him repeatedly to keep him 'rooted' in a sense.  I zone out, run to the south wall in East Commonlands, zone back in to find the raid.<br>
<br>
(also, beware that Lucan has TWO forms.. a live form, and a dead form which he will spawn into when his live form dies)<br>
<br>
Pull Lucan, kill, loot.  Easy.  However, beware of extra guards or Brother Jentry that will come out to assist Lucan after a bit (he can COMPLETE HEAL).  Kill Lucan fast. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Take Testimony of Truth to Valeron for Brilliant Sword of Faith.<br>
<br>
(Lucan stats)<br>
Type: Guard<br>
Race, Class: HUM<br>
Level Range: 48 - 48<br>
Hit Points: 8134<br>
Hits For: 60 - 120<br>
Monetary Loot: None<br>
Special Attack: Dual wield<br>
Spawn Time: 8 hours<br>
Magical weapon not required.<br>
<br>
3) Testimony of Truth (NOT THE ONE FROM LUCAN, that one is turned in to Valeron for the Brilliant Sword of Faith)<br>
<br>
Talk to Merko who is located in the Hall of Truth in North Freeport. The first thing Merko asks you for is to help Altunic Jartin in East Commons and he hands you a letter to give him. Hand Altunic the letter and he will ask you to help him with a thief named Squire Narl. Narl spawns near the third inn, in East Commons. Kill him and return with his head to Altunic. After that, he will ask you to get a cloth shirt for him. Head to the nearest cloth merchant and purchase the shirt. Hand it back to Altunic and he will give you a Token of Generosity. <br>
<br>
Head back to Freeport and tell Merko that you have earned the Token of Generosity. He will now ask you to get him a spider venom sack. Head out to the commons and start killing all the Desert Tarantulas you see. Once you have looted the venom sack, head back and give it to Merko, who will reward you with a Token of Bravery. Merko now asks you to hand him both Tokens to be able to take the Test of Truth. Hand both tokens to him and he will ask to you kill the Female Militia Spy who spawns in the sewers below Freeport. The spy is actually Guard Willia, who is near the canoe. Kill her and you will loot the Token of Truth, which you give to Merko and your reward is the Testimony of Truth Scroll. <br>
<br>
4) Banker's Note<br>
<br>
Talk to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth. She wants you to take a letter to warn him. The sentry is outside the militia training house in West Freeport(He's outside by the door). Speak a code word to him (I think it's in the note given to you by Kalatrina Plossen, I'm doing this whole walkthrough from my memory) and give him the note. He will in turn hand you another note to take back to the hall of truth. Right after this happens two guards run up and kill him. The note says &quot;Zimel's Blades&quot;, and a bunch of otherwise illegible writing. Head over to Groflah's shop (in North Freeport) and hand him the note. He then explains a lot in detail about what happened that night to Zimel's Blades, but asks you to meet him Seafarers at night in East Freeport by the docks.  He then hands you back the note. Meet up with Groflah again, around 1-3am, talk to him and hand him the note once more. Now head over and talk to the beggar Tykar Renlin, who is also at the bar. You will need to give him four Drom Champagnes (made through brewing) first to loosen his tongue. He will tell you that Zimel is actually being held prisoner below the arena and has gone mad, and then hands you a blanket incase you find Zimel. Head over to the Arena and talk with Zimel (jump into the arena and go through the barred door, he's in a cell), you will need to hand him the Blanket, Edible Goo (cooking), and then Bog Juice (brewing) to get him to talk, and in turn he will hand you a banker's key, labeled H.K.102. Head to High Keep and hand the banker the key, she will hand you back a banker's note to deliver to Brother Hayle who is trapped in Paw.<br>
<br>
FINAL SEQUENCES FOR SOULFIRE-- Head to the lair of the Splitpaw located in South Karana.  Brother Hayle is in the jail area, which you can reach with simple invisibility.  Solo paladins can buy invisibility potions from shops.<br>
<br>
YOU NEED HIGH FACTION FOR THIS PART, amiably or better.  CON HIM FIRST!<br>
<br>
Hand him the banker's note.  He'll give you back another note.<br>
<br>
Then hand him all at once--<br>
<br>
1) Brilliant Sword of Faith<br>
2) The Hilt<br>
3) The Testimony of Truth (the one from the newbie quest)<br>
4) The note that Hayle gives you in exchange for the banker's note<br>
<br>
This will earn you the Soulfire.<br>
<br>
The Soulfire is needed for the Blessing of Nobility.<br>
<br>
Step Three - <br>
<br>
Obtaining Miragul's Head and Robe is NOT an easy task at all.  It requires two RARE drops off Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox (BOTH DRAGONS). *note - you can also get these books off Kunark dragons.<br>
<br>
Now, you can't just walk up and kill Miragul for the head and robe.  You have to invoke his soul.<br>
<br>
You can loot the books yourself but it's harder.  I've seen it done.  Just get an enc to loot them if possible.<br>
<br>
1) Kill Nagafen and hope he drops a book (it's called &quot;a torn, charred book&quot; or something to that nature).  Have a good enchanter friend of yours that is at the raid loot it.<br>
<br>
2) Kill Lady Vox and hope she drops a book (named &quot;a torn, frost covered book&quot;).  Again, have a good enchanter friend of yours that is at the raid loot it. <br>
<br>
3) Have the enchanters head to Neriak to the Blind Fish Tavern.  The bartender who will combine the two torn books into the Book of Scale is downstairs, near the windows.  If you had two separate enchanters loot the books for you, you need to do something slightly different.  If not, just have the enchanter hand her the books (using +faction and illusion) and 1000pp for the book of scale.  If two different enchanters looted the Naggy book and Vox book for you..<br>
<br>
1) Have enchanter #1 hand her the vox/nagafen book.<br>
2) Have enchanter #2 hand her the nagafen/vox book AND 1000 platinum.<br>
3) Enchanter #2 will receive the Book of Scale.<br>
<br>
4) Have Enchanter #2 head to the Ocean of Tears to the Oracle Island.  He is normally not up, due to lame asses killing the Oracle for his 5pp robe.  /groan. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       Nevertheless, have your enchanter buddy camp him.  When he spawns, have him give the oracle the book of scale.  In return, the enchanter will get Miragul's Philactry.  Miragul's soul!<br>
<br>
5) Travel to Everfrost Mountains with a raid.  Miragul's not too hard, but not THAT easy either.  Miragul's located in the underwater caverns under the frozen river.  Have your enchanter charm the lich of Miragul and hand him the Miragul's Philactry.  His true form will arise!  Kill it!  He is 53ish, really easy since the level cap was heightened.<br>
<br>
Paladin loots Robe and Head.<br>
<br>
Step Four - <br>
<br>
Travel to Plane of Sky, island four.  I did it with 18 people, all 55+.  This is pretty difficult, because a lot of the mobs are level 60. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
However, you'll reach island 4 eventually. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Have a wizard port back down to island 1.  Have him buy a Key of Veeshan off the Key Master (1 copper) and head to the quest hall.  Spawn Dirkog Steelhand by talking to an efreeti with a name something like Goldenblade?  *shrug*  Give Dirkog 500pp.  Inte Akera will spawn on isle 4 where the raid party is waiting inside the windmill.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT PART (don't screw this up!)<br>
*note - you must have high faction with Deepwater Knights before traveling to Plane of Sky, kill a low level necromancer in Paineel to do so*<br>
<br>
1) Paladin gives Inte Akera Ghoulbane<br>
- Paladin receives Blessing of Sacrifice<br>
<br>
2) Paladin gives Inte Akera SoulFire<br>
- Paladin receives Blessing of Nobility<br>
<br>
3) Paladin gives Inte Akera ..<br>
-Blessing of Nobility<br>
-Blessing of Sacrifice<br>
-Head of Miragul<br>
-Robe of Miragul<br>
<br>
4) Paladin receives F I E R Y  A V E N G E R!<br>
<br>
*CHEER!!* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Now, you have the Fiery Avenger, AN AWESOME WEAPON IN ITSELF.  However, you want better, don't you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       Of course.<br>
<br>
You're halfway done the epic quest to receive Fiery Defender now that you have Fiery Avenger.  Take a deep breath, a break for a few days and start! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
F I E R Y  D E F E N D E R  Q U E S T -<br>
<br>
Items needed -<br>
<br>
1) Fiery Avenger<br>
<br>
2) Mark of Atonement<br>
<br>
~~<br>
<br>
To get this weapon, you have to release a tormented soul (Irak Altil). To do this, you need to find his old armor, sword and shield. These have to be purified by light, gem and water. <br>
<br>
Step One -- Tainted Dark Steel Shield<br>
<br>
This is dropped by Kirak Vil in Nektulos Forest, a level 57 dark elf guard.  He has superior regeneration (a bit better than Cazel IMO).  Take a big raid party for 'em. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Step Two -- Cleanse the shield!<br>
<br>
Take the Tainted Dark Steel Shield to Elia the Pure in Felwithe, who is simply standing by the water.  Just give the shield to her, and she'll give you the cleansed version.<br>
<br>
Step Three -- Tainted Dark Steel Breastplate<br>
<br>
This is dropped by Thought Destroyers in the Plane of Hate (level 55).  They randomly spawn out of scorn banshees (the ones that drop bard armor).<br>
<br>
Step Four -- Cleanse the Breastplate!<br>
<br>
You have to do a small miniquest to cleanse this one.  You have to talk to Jark in Kaladim, a dwarf in the mines.  (you have to play with some crappy keywords to get him to talk, listed below)<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Jark' <br>
You say, 'some' <br>
<br>
Jark says 'Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich but it'll sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine was supposed ta bring me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my dinner? I aint got nothing ta pay ya with but I <br>
sure would appreciate it. <br>
<br>
You say, 'I will get your dinner' <br>
<br>
Jark says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out there somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple so maybe shes there. Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have everythin ready fer me. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nella's located up near the cleric guild standing by the water, she spawns when you talk to Jark.  Just say 'dinner' to her and she'll give you his dinner.<br>
<br>
Take the pie back to Jark (be sure not to eat it!) and give it to him.  You'll receive the gem.  Easy?  YES! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Take the gem and the breastplate to Reklon Gnallen in Erudin, at the Temple of Quellious.<br>
<br>
Give them to him to receive the new cleansed breastplate.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Step Four - Get the Tainted Dark Steel Sword<br>
<br>
This is by far the hardest part of the mark of atonement quest.  It's dropped off the Keeper of the Tombs *deep* in The Hole.  You need a powerful guild or a FULL FLEDGED raid for this one if you don't want to be wiped out.  Awesome maps can be found here-- <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~berjd/hole/">www.bol.ucla.edu/~berjd/hole/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
He's a week spawntime from what I've clocked, maybe a bit less.  (I camped a halfling rogue there for about 6 days straight, no spawn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     )<br>
<br>
Just to show ya how hard doing this is-- I brought 45 people.. all level 49+ and *EVERYONE* died.  I barely got to loot the sword before I died.  He's level 55, and a shadowknight (harm touch).  The reason this is so hard is because the area around him is full of level 50+ mobs.. with FOUR MINUTE SPAWNTIMES.  Basically, you fight until you die.  Simple as that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       You can try pulling him out.. but I don't know how that'll work.  Oh yeah, it's hard to mez the mobs too.  Heh, just gets better eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Step Five - Cleanse the sword!<br>
<br>
Ya need to get a bucket of pure water to do this part, another small miniquest.. although low-IQ assholes make this part harder than it should.<br>
<br>
Talk to a peasant woman near the monk guild in West Freeport. You say to peasant woman &quot;what water&quot; then &quot;I will take it&quot;. You get a bucket of water. Hand it in to her brother Joshua and it will be turned into Pure water. Joshua is in the bakery near his sister. <br>
<br>
That's it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
However, the peasant woman is like fucking level 7 and little idiot newbies like to kill her.  I guess they get off by doing it.  *shrug*  She's a 14 hour spawntime. ;(<br>
<br>
Take the tainted dark steel sword and the bucket of water to Reklon Gnallen in Erudin for the cleansed sword.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Step 6 -- Get the mark of atonement!<br>
<br>
Give Reklon Gnallen in Erudin the following ~<br>
<br>
1) Gleaming Crested Sword (cleansed sword)<br>
2) Gleaming Crested Shield (cleansed shield)<br>
3) Gleaming Crested Breastplate (cleased breastplate)<br>
<br>
You'll be given a gold coin, entitled the Mark of Atonement.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Step 7 -- GET THE FIERY DEFENDER! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Join a Plane of Fear raid.  Hell, join a few.  Get some Valorium along the way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the tormented soul (Irak Altil) is located here, in VERY DANGEROUS AREAS.  You'll die, or the entire raid will die as a result of your actions if you're not careful.  <br>
<br>
Now, understand, Irak Altil is not up all the time.  In fact, he's a pretty rare spawn.<br>
<br>
Me and Talan believe that he spawns -<br>
<br>
1) Randomly after golem deaths (Fright, Dread, Terror)<br>
2) 100% after draco dies<br>
<br>
Take it how you wish.. his spawn procedures are pretty unknown.<br>
<br>
When you get to the point of killing golems, a lot of the Graveyard will be cleared pretty much.  WALK SLOWLY through there with a ranger companion.  Put the raid on hold for now, in case you aggro something and have to pull it back to kill.  Have the ranger track for Irak Altil.  He's by the glare lord bridge and wanders near Cazic Thule pathing and the edge of the graveyard.  When we found him, I hit him with a DD (Flame of Light), and pulled him into the camp, where an enchanter mem blurred him.<br>
<br>
Step 72390291295 (seems like it, eh?) -- Hand in your items!<br>
<br>
Once you get Irak Altil safely, give him--<br>
<br>
1) Fiery Avenger<br>
2) Mark of Atonement<br>
<br>
You'll receive your brand new Fiery Defender, and Irak will despawn.  CONGRATULATIONS!  WOO! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

<br>
Any idea on how long it takes you to convert your &quot;indifferent&quot; faction to &quot;Kindly&quot; with Deepwater knights?  I've spent about 5-6 hours on the necro<br>
in toxulla.  Then after making a quick run to Paineel,<br>
I found I could raise faction by killing a similar <br>
necro just outside the gates.   So I can run between<br>
both spawns fairly quickly.  They are both 6 minute<br>
spawn.   I'm probably getting there in under 4 minutes,<br>
but talk about a headache.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm just looking for an estimate on how many<br>
more hours I might have.<br>
<br>
Thanks <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

So it's either the Paineel necro or the one in Tox for your choices.  Actually, I ran and did both.  With jboots you can do non-stop killing of both, which would limit your time I would guess.  <br>
<br>
I'm still indifferent and upwards of 6-7 hours camping them. I'll keep at it.<br>

Banlaen killed them all, and apparently the 5 necros do give good hit to all Erudin factions. Now 5 NPCs spawns at same spot is much faster than 2 NPCS spawns 1 zone apart.

There's also a human NPC standing by the 5 necros who will not respond to my hails but will respond hails to those who have good fation with Erudin. He apparently gives a quest, since no good aligned people has ever entered the city, the quest is probalby yet undiscovered /shrug<br>
