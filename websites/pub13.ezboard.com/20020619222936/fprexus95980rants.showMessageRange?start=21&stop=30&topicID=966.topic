class=title> I don't mean to get off on a rant here...</span><hr size=1> I was one of those newbs that struggled for almsot everything I got...<br>
<br>
Now, I wasn't here from the beginning, I only started playing after Kunark, but even then, I had one friend who played and the amount of twinking I got was limited to a lego bracer. After that, I to work my butt off from rawhide to overpriced vendor chain to quested Ivy to most of the stuff I've gotten today. (Which admittedly is a lot)<br>
<br>
I went through the motions and never begged and never complained about how tough it was. I don't think I noticed twinks getting preferential treatment over me for groups, or if I did, I didn't care. I found groups almost everywhere I went, from Blackburrow to Lake of Ill Omen and many places in between.<br>
<br>
Now the game certainly has changed, newer stuff has come out and made once uber stuff run-of-the-mill. This was bound to happen as the game aged. If everyone was still vying for Yaks, no one would still be playing. Hell, I found myself giving the Yak that I fought long and hard for to a newb the other day. After I had done it, I realized how much blood sweat and tears went into it and thought, &quot;this guy won't appreciate the level of hardship it took to get that&quot;, but then I thought, &quot;there's a bunch of stuff that he'll have to go through if he's really serious, so it's all a wash in the end&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps some of this needs to change, perhaps VI needs to put in some sort of decay code that causes all but the most uber of items (and perhaps even those items as wwll) to degrade over time, forcing even those people who have been twinked to the eyeballs will have to quest for replacements or repairs to their higher-end items.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I don't think the game has changed nearly as much as the quality of the players. There's been an influx of newer players lately who seem to expect everything handed to them on a silver platter. Look at the changes in yesterday's patch for an example of the sweeping changes VI has made to, in their words, &quot;smooth the path&quot; for the newbs, who apparently found the game too hard in its old format. <br>
<br>
I see this as sort of an insult to all the old-school players who had to deal with hell levels. It's made our accomplishments, (if you can call the trials and tribulations of a collection of polygons accomplishments) seem a bit diminshed. If I had known a year and a half ago, that it would be significantly easier to level to my current status, I might have waited. But then I would have missed part of what made Tyburon the Ranger he is today. (often dead, notwithstanding). But then again, I think all the newbs who now breeze from 1-50 won't appreciate what it's really like to make it to the &quot;uber&quot; levels and that's the real shame.<br>
<br>
But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushirelliachaosweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shirellia Chaosweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 2:52:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I don't mean to get off on a rant here...</span><hr size=1> Well, I'm only a baby compared to alot here, my highest is a 47th Enchanter, who WAS semi-twinked befor 40.

Infact I forgot to mention in that post that was just my corny little theory. But you can't blame me for coming to that conspiracy. I mean prexus doesn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> kinda</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need to split, it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> desperately</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> needs to split. Coming from a lower level character (49) I really haven't experienced the really old days when no expansions were out to the public. But I do realize the major difference here and there is a considerably large amount of issues, too many issues on this server for it to not split. Then again I doubt this will happen so no reason to cry about it.<br>
<br>
As far as twinking and twinks getting into groups go, that is not something to be mad about. Non-twinks can easily reach the power of a twink by spending time to obtain better gear. LOL I have been 49 for a long time now because I have been trying to get better gear for myself.<br>

<br>
So there are 4 more people looking for a group that could be in that group.  The low to mid level game is going to the crapper because of all this new gear floating around from expansions.  People give their melee character an uber slasher with some wicked haste item and they can solo a spire at paw with their warrior at level 25.  I have seen it.  It was sick.  The mobs are yellow and red yet with a fungi, haste and mega ac and weapons this person was cleaning house.  <br>
<br>
I logged on one day.  Said I was looking for a group at paw and no answer.  I ran to the spires and people who conned blue were soloing the spires.  I was level 26.  I know I could solo a spire with charm kiting with my bard for sure but it isn't safe at all and in the end I have to take down my charmed pet which is no easy task when it is very close to my level.  (This is IF I can keep the charm going)<br>
<br>
So now to get a group I have to wait and wait and wait till the twinked soloers or the person getting PLed moves on etc.<br>
This was never so not so long ago.<br>
<br>
What verant should have done is made most weapons and armor etc NO DROP.  YOU EARN it.  Don't buy it or pass it down.<br>
<br>
DAoC solved this from the start.  Weapons have a level on them.  If it cons too high then it will decay rapidly and become useless.  If it cons too low then it will suck hehe.<br>
<br>
I just wish DAoC had more content and a larger place to roam about.  That may change.  DAoC has learned from all the mistakes of EQ but they don't have the amount of content that EQ has.  This is due to its infancy.<br>
<br>
Either way the game is geard towards the high end game now.  People bypass mid level dungeons and loot because they already have better and use these areas for PLing and soloing when they would never would have lasted 5 seconds in these places if they were not twinked or getting PLed.<br>
<br>
It is the grief of the many so that the few may prosper... again.  Should only have been allowed one char per server in the beginning.<br>
<br>
Do I oppose twinking?  To an extent yes.  I never over twink my chars.  For my bard I got him some decent slashing weapons and some fine plate for the extra ac.  Got him some +ac +hp rings and that was it.  I am going to do the lambent armor quests as my next armor upgrade.  I am going to do the tambourine quest as my next instrument upgrade.<br>
<br>
Either way the oldworld is getting raped for xp and it is getting much too hard to find a group now.  Tonight a druid was PLing a cleric in High Keep and took away from the group I was in so that a cleric that could get good xp in a group hunting something lower was getting handed to them xp they don't deserve.<br>
<br>
Makes me sad to see that the fun of others takes a backseat to the impatience and greed of the few.<br>

You wanna run around without worrying about not getting any mobs because<br>
some twink is soloing? Try Stonebrunt, I sent my girlfriend there the other night<br>

I gues it just comes down to the fact that the world has gotten a lot larger and there<br>
are still plenty of places to hunt for those willing to go beyond the areas they're used <br>

I don't know where this topic took its turn, but other changes don't bother me. The fact that some spawns or some camps are now 'easier' to take out is simply how things progress. Sure the way our server has turned out in the bad way is progress, but it can be altered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustocamp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SToC Amp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/28/02 10:35:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stoc.clanpages.com/icons/stoc.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Norrath of Old</span><hr size=1> ahh the good ol days...I remember when I got my dark reaver..that was the single best peice of equipment i owned at the time (i still have it too and use it every now and then)<br>

Granted I did stay in the top 10% of the server so most the zones we went to had, 2 groups in them tops.<br>
<br>
  Try doing Oasis with Lockjaw roaming the zone 24/7 cause no one was high enuff lv to take him out, Or spending 5 hrs on a cr in solb. Because your damn puller didn't know the Noble could charm you and run you around in a zone that I personal had only seen the entry hall of.<br>
<br>
   Would I trade any of these experinces away? Hell no, But Prexus is a far safer and easier place to play now. <p><center> <img src="http://www.purgatory.net/lomis/lomisig.jpg"> </center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table>
