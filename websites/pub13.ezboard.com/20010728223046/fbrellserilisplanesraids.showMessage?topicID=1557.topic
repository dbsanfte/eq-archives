<br>
I would like to throw out some suggestions, most of which are not at all unique, but are the way I as an individual would like to see things go from here.  This in NO WAY is posted to reflect my guild's position.<br>
<br>
I would adopt Adun's original system for Trak, Naggy, Vox and VS(ya, i know he is FCFS at this point)<br>
<br>
I would expand the planar dates to 3 weeks.  I would roll off between the first 5 raids that posted for EVERY date.  Duplicate postings from same interested parties would eliminate the prior posting.  Guilds would not be allowed to raid fear and hate within 7 days of each other.  Oh ya, and ONLY guilds would be allowed to sign up for Planar raids.<br>
<br>
If the reservation system is all that, why not fix it, instead of expanding the animosity now ebing felt by alot of people on this server?<br>

<br>
In a guild raid, some 36 people go up and kill mobs.<br>
<br>
In an indy raid, some 36 people go up and kill mobs.<br>
<br>
People seem to think that an indy reserving something is like one person having the same rights as 30.  But the indy is just the leader, they have 35 other people with them, just like the leader of a guild raid has 35 other people with them.  Unless the leader is claiming loot, there is really no difference between the 36 on an indy raid, and the 36 on a guild raid.  It is not one person having the same rights as a guild, its 36 people not in the same guild having the same rights as 36 people who are in one guild.<br>
<br>
Anyways, it seems that non-action on ideas like this has been a major problem, so lets take this to a vote.  Right now, post a voting thread on these ideas and see how people vote.  If we want changes, we have to make them, and not sit here whistling dixie.  We should not let the vocal minority make or kill these issues, let the server decide, but this up for a vote immediatly, if it passes, great, if it fails, oh well, it will have been the will of the server, and not the rhetoric of a few.<br>

It's like: Hey Indie dude, you scratch our back, we will scratch your back.  Hence, the guild in reality uses an indie to obtain another slot on the list.  <br>
<br>
Now, if an Indie raider had 50% of his raid made up of his buddie Indie raiders, that would be cool.  But when I see an indie raider doing Trak, VS, Planes, ect, it's usually 60% or more of one guild.<br>

<br>
Do away with all reservations. If one reservation list can be pressured into being removed, then anyone of them can. What's the point?<br>
<br>
I have to honestly say that in one day my entire faith in the server, the boards and this community has been shot.<br>
<br>
So many people can't even see the forest for the trees. BIG DEAL about the list.  If the omnipotent power of a Mod can wipe away an entire reservation system in place, than what good is it?<br>
<br>
If the boards remain, so be it. Then they'll be boards for the community to chat and gather. However, they're worthless as a reservation system.<br>

Frankly, I'm not even sure I wish to continue to play on Brell any longer.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upooferman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pooferman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/22/01 10:15:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   My thoughts (delayed a bit my circumstances)</span><hr size=1> I'll give that sometimes indy raids are monopolized by one guild.<br>
<br>
However, that is not sufficient reason to take away raiding from all indys.<br>
<br>
The great thing about an indy raid is that the leader can invite whoever they want.  If I lead an raid, I don't have all 36 of my spots defaulted to guildies, I can take who I want.  That means I can take my friends, some of whom are also indys, or in smaller guilds that rarely raid.  I can also take my friends who might happen to be in large guild.  No matter how I as the leader pick who comes, 36 people go.  Guild tag does not matter; maybe it is 60% one guild, but its 36 people raiding nonetheless.  Am I going to say, &quot;Hey, Guild_00's raid is 80% Guild_00!&quot;?  Maybe that is kind of a silly analogy, but if indy's don't begrudge a guild the right to take who they choose on their raids, why should guilds take that right from Indy's?  Keep in mind a guild of 4 can as easily sign up for one of the planes and bring in the entire raid from another guild as an indy can.<br>
<br>
It has been my experience as an indy on our crowded server, that there is rarely room for an indy or anyone not very well renown on various raids.  I've signed up and been turned down for numerous hate raids, why? Well maybe some people just don't like me, but very often its because who ever is raiding already has 6 or more warriors who want to go in their guild, they just don't have room for outsiders.  Indy raids are an extremely valuable asset to the server, because they often prove one of the rare chances for other indys or other lesser know people to raid.<br>
<br>
Further more, Adune's system was, and I wasn't around to hear the original proposal so correct me if I'm wrong, that the leader must field some half the raid strait up, and those who supported the raid cannot be used again until the raid is over?  This means that on the rotatable mobs, the kind of indy abuse Redspine referred to would be impossible.<br>
<br>
In the planes, it is almost a moot point.  If I lead a raid and fill every slot but mine with guild_00, it hardly matters, those 35 people get to raid, get their armor, and get out of the system.  Very few people raid hate/fear for fun, 90% of raiders just want to get their armor and get out, so if all of the people in guild_00 get their armor faster, great, they'll get out of the planes and make room for new people to come in and get armor.  <br>
<br>
The planar issue where this has been of recent concern over is the gods.  More and more often a higher-level guild will be more than happy to &quot;help&quot; a small guild or indy with their raid, so that they can kill the new buffed up gods.  This is indeed an issue, but it will not go away by scapegoating indys and taking away their right to lead raids.  Any small guild, and there are a lot of them who raids the planes, can and often will get help from the bigger guilds.  So is it fair to disallow indys and any guild that cannot field every member of plane raid from raiding to keep the big fish from getting the gods out of turn? No, this is an issue with the gods, and the gods need to be addressed specifically, instead of taking away the rights of the smaller entities.  That is exactly like what is being done with the fire giants.  The only reason to take down the reservations for the fire giants is ragefire, and that's very clear to see.  People decided it would be easier to take away the rights of the smaller fire giant raiders than to directly address the issue of ragefire.  If we put ragefire on a reservation or rotation system, the entire issue with the fire giants would disappear.  Keep in mind that both Naggy and the fire giants have been simultaneously reserved, and in my whole time on these boards I have yet to see a rant about Naggy raiders ignoring fire giant reservations.  If we were to put the gods on a separate rotation system, the issue with the big fishes abusing indy raids would die, because there would just be no reason for the biggies to bother.  They would only need to wait for a path through the plane to be cleared, just like naggy raiders waiting for the fire giants to die, then swoop in, do their thing, and leave.  <br>
<br>
The point is that taking away indy's rights to raid will not solve anything.  On any current rotation list, dropping indy's off the list will decrease the rotation by a month at maximum.  Using adune's system, guilds using indys to get extra spots on rotation lists would go away.  In the planes of hate/fear, it is not an issue except for the gods, which must be dealt with as a separate issue, it is just not fair to take rights away from indys while ignoring the real issue.  In sky…well sky is rarely reserved jammed, so if a guild wants to go up there a lot, more power to them.<br>
