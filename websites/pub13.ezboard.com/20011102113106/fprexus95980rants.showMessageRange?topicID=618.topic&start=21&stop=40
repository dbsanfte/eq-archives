<br>
If your main is in Unity, and you have a twink in FA. If you heard some people badmouthing Unity, would you run to Unity and tell them?<br>
<br>
It speaks to a loyalty issue and the ability to separate the characters from each other. <br>
<br>
Would you be able to recognize the badmouthing as perhaps just an outlet at releasing some steam and not a real issue which it could turn into if the mad person went off on Unity instead of keeping the rant within guild chat?<br>
<br>
Or if you were on your twink and saw FA preparing to assemble for, say, Sev, would you quickly log off and log onto your Unity character because you know a warrior in your guild that needs Sev also and try to beat FA to the punch?<br>
<br>
If people are mature and keep the two guilds separated and avoid conflicts of interest, then generally, no, I don't have a problem with someone having a character or two in my guild while having a character or two in another guild.<br>
<br>
However, FA has a policy that states to be a member of FA you can't be guilded with another guild. Prexus membership in general doesn't have to agree with that, we don't care, join a guild that doesn't have that requirement. But if you want to be in FA, then we ask that you be loyal to FA. Naturally, there will always be exceptions to this. Sergex is probably a good example. As a guildleader himself, he knows the lines that shouldn't be crossed and so far has not abused the exception that has been made for him and others like him that FA allows into the circle of trust. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujrail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jrail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/2/01 4:14:33 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://gs.cdnow.com/graphics/COVERART/AMG/M/11/34/00291134.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Have some respect when you leave!</span><hr size=1> Offense intended here: @#%$ punt them all.

<br>
FA doesn't really care about your guild's policy on twinks in<br>
other guilds, all we care about it keeping the privacy of our chat just that, private.<br>
<br>
There's two people who have already posted on this board that they have twinks in FA and are not regular members.<br>
I think we'd all like to see you post that you logged on and respected FA's wishes and deguilded yourself.  It's not going to take too much time out of your busy schedule and you'll be doing us a favor.<br>
<br>
To the people who have twinks in FA and haven't posted, we know you do, so please play the good guy (gal) and deguild.<br>
<br>
We're a very close-knit family and we want to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
It can be a lot of fun to know more people, and I hope guilds will make efforts to interact.<br>
<br>
Now since this is obviously somewhat triggered by FA's posts about being especially closed, let me say about them that they seem to me to do a good job of staying social in ways I've seen; some of the people are social I know, and they've recently invited me on a raid for some fun. So it's not aimed at them<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Just more a thought to keep in mind.<br>
<br>
It's not even really much of a problem at all on Prexus, but it does seem the trend is a decrease in inter-guild interaction. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

If this is such a huge problem as Memnenth points out &quot;10-12 people&quot;  why not disband guild and reinvite. Solves the problem I would think.  Just an idea.<br>

You obviously accepted him into your guild, he didn't beg for it.

<br>
Bondarelli: If you aren't in FA, you aren't in FA...so I don't see the need for anyone who isn't in our guild to see our guild chat.  Period.  Are we harboring secrets of overthrowing uber_guild01?  No.  Do we talk about things that we don't want certain people to hear?  Probably.  Does it make a difference if we do?  No...you nor random_person01 needs to see it.  It is our guild's chat.  It is private, you want to see it...apply for the guild.  <br>
<br>
Same as rants on loot in some respect.  It's our guild's policy.  We decide what's best for us...not everyone else.  <br>
<br>
It's not about being anti-social.  It's about security and keeping guild chat just that...a chat within our guild.  It's one of the more secure channels we use to speak w/ each other.  We don't need someone else logging in randomly and logging our daily chat sessions.<br>
<br>
If someone of another guild is playing a character in our guild, we simply ask him/her to deguild for the time being or we do it for them.  Nothing permanent, and said character can be reinvited once the real owner is on once again.  I'm sure other guilds feel the same way.    <p><font size=6 color=darkred>Shaorinor Soulbringer</font>

First if it is FA policy to not allow twinks to stay in the guild after you remove a main, so be it and you should respect that.<br>
<br>
Second, Maddie you are a bit too rabid on this.  Them disbanding X twink the next time that twink logs in should be acceptable, asking them to login specially just for you is a bit much.  Yes logging in a char, /guildremove and camping is not hard or time consuming but you want them to go out of their way for you.  Just remove them next time they are on and respect the guild you were in and their policies. <p><br>

Can you associate the difference between Everquest and real life?  Do you comprehend that when I speak of 99% of the people in this game, I'm talking about them from an Everquest perspective?  If it pains you to believe that some people are more &quot;important&quot; in this game than other people, TFB.  It's like that in all &quot;team sports&quot; why would a &quot;team game&quot; like EQ be any different?<br>
<br>
I didn't invite Sergex into the Guild, nor did any of our current leadership.<br>
<br>
Eryl was your second comment just for sake of argument?  Are you actually implying that taking 1 minute to log on your twink and Guildremove that twink is actually an inconvience? No, I didn't think you were implying something so stupid, now go edit and change your post.<br>

It's the right thing to do.  Even if you leave on unpleasent terms, you should have enough pride and honor in yourself to LEAVE a place where you're obviously not wanted.  <br>
<br>
Let's be honest, people are leaving their twinks in guild chat because of the curiosity in human nature to find out &quot;what other people are talking about.&quot;  <br>
<br>
My wife had this to say about Anonymous lurkers listening to our guild chat <br>
<br>
&quot;It seems kinda creepy&quot;<br>
<br>
yup.<br>

You seem to miss the reality here.  The people doing what you say will not remove themselves even after logging the twink.  I speak of the people who have respect though they are not happy, the people that won't spy and check things out.  Those are the ones that should be respected back and understand they may not want to go out of their way for you.  The people that eavesdrop are different and your rant will fall on deaf ears.<br>
<br>
You can think what you want, but I think you are being a bit irrational in the expectations because you are angry.  The main issue seems to be the integrity of guild chat, and respecting the guild and people.  They either will or won't, give the respect to those who deserve it and don't ask them to go out of their way if they are not willing to.  Expect them to respect your chat privacy and not listen in, just disband next time they login that twink. <p><br>

I may be a tad off base, but I think that is exactly what is expected when you leave a guild - removing your twinks. Personally it wouldn't bother me if the twink/alt was still technically guilded because that person has not logged on - what I find queer is when the twink/alt is signed on and the person chooses NOT to /guildremove...or better yet --goes /anon so it's more difficult to track said alt and have an officer /guildremove on the spot...<br>

<br>
Instead I inherited it from Myrrdinn.  I have done alot differently and I beleive it is an entirely different guild.<br>
<br>
Regardless of all that, since I did not MAKE the name &quot;Fallen Alliance&quot; if I were to disband and recreated since I am not the original owner of the name I can not have it back.<br>
<br>
Does that seem fair to you?  Seems pretty lame to me =/.<br>
<br>
Regardless, A private channel is just that.  You staying in a guild after leaving is not different than stealing cable television.  Which is punishable by jail time. <p><font size=6 color=darkred>Memnenth Peredhil</font>

<br>
Quoting Maddie - What is the difference?<br>
<br>
The differance is that all my equipment/items I had have been given away to the friends/people who helped me obtain them in the first place. Thus the time they invested to help me get them will not be used for my personal profit. In addition, I leave the account to someone who has a terrific repution on this server &amp; will use my account to help others and not to just help himself.<br>
