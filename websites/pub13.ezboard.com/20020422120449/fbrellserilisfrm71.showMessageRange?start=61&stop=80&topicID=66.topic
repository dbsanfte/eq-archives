<br>
no one wants an indy to get a spot by himself. but they could ask to get on the list and get 18 support votes as well. also they could be allowed to support a guild. (someone called this an &quot;alliance between a guild and an indy&quot;).<br>

Well, I have thought about it the last few days and here is my suggestion:<br>
Change the &quot;No Alt&quot; clause to &quot;Only active Charactors.&quot; <br>
<br>
This way legitimate active alts can be part of the 18. Those that are just high level Mules or what ever would not be eligable for a spot on the list of 18. I think that would address both of our concerns. It would mine, at least.<br>
<br>
One reason I am kinda adimate about the alt thing is differant classes learn differant things on a multi-group raid situation. My Shammie would learn how to buff a Multi-group raid; My Monk would learn how to pull giants and how to Chain-pull; I have learned how to MA and SA on these raids as a Paladin.<br>
<br>
I guess what I am saying is raiding a dragon with Class A is not the same as raiding one with Class B. So making sure that people with ACTIVE Class B charactors can learn their class better in Multi-Group situations is a good thing and not just repitition of prior experiance.<br>

<br>
----<br>
Any guild that has the ability to defeat Talendor/Gorenaire or Trakanon may not request to reserve a spot for Nagafen or Vox for themselves.  However, they may be part of an existing guild alliance that has signed up, but may not make up more than 1/3 of the required 18 members to keep their spot on the list (ie: 6 members or one group).  These members may not be secondary or alternate characters, and the guild may not be a part of more than one alliance at a time.<br>
----<br>
<br>
The problem that I see is that the system doesn't take into account those people that are within the level range, but because of their guildtag, won't allow them to sponsor another guild's raid.  I think allowing some flexibility in this would help a great deal.  Take for example, one guild &quot;black-listed&quot;, Blood Inferno.  They have a huge amount of people in their guild, many of which are above 52.  However, there are those that are within the level range, and are probably primary characters.  Allowing those lower levels to particiapte in an alliance would give them an opportunity in raiding, and give them a shot and obtaining otherwise nearly impossible pieces of their epics.<br>
<br>
Part of the problem with the system that I see is that it has to do with epics.  There are no less than four epic pieces on those two dragons for three classes.  Telling those people that they have to kill Gorenaire to get their book or scale is, to me, unfair.  Unfortunately, I have to disagree on the point that the reason people raid Vox/Naggy is to get raid experience.  The reason Brell's Chosen hosted Vox was simply so I could obtain that White Dragonscale.  That was my only reason, plain and simple.  (By the way, even though I couldn't participate in the fight, I played a friend's Druid, so I wouldn't be leading from the sidelines).<br>
<br>
Nothing's perfect, I know, and I disagree with the addenums put in.  But, I will respect them.  This is just what I have to say, and a suggestion I have to fix a problem that I see.<br>

<br>
Don't blame the Brell boards, blame Verant. They are the ones that force you to get it from Vox or Gorenaire. So you have two options.<br>
<br>
1) Stay 52 or below until you get it. Obviously that is what Verant intended. They made them with the limit of 52 because they would be too easy to kill with 53+ characters. Taking down Vox could be done with a single group of 55+ with decent gear, same with Nagafen. I know this personally because there are tougher dragons in WWastes that I take down with single groups. The level limit was intentional and has a reason to it. Verant never meant for you to have a bunch of 46-52 friends kill something and hand over it's price to you at 53+.<br>
<br>
2) Kill Gorenaire. Since Velious and Luclin gear and spells, she isn't really that hard to take down. Yes she is a rushed mob, but what else do you want with your epic? Try finding Vessel Drozlin, Verina Tomb, or Zord Ragefire up for more than an hour or so. It's part of your epic. Epics aren't supposed to be &quot;easy, sign up on a list, and get what you want&quot; items. They take effort, hard work, and determination. (Well some of them do)<br>
<br>
I think Juujuu hit the nail on the head. I can almost guarantee that 90% of the people in dispute of these changes are because of epic pieces. And each of those epic pieces are available somewhere else as well. If you have a problem with the placement of the epic pieces on these &gt;53 restricted mobs, then petition (no not the command) Verant about it to get a change done. Twiggie's system is completely fair and eliminates most of the exploiting done by guilds. <p><img src=http://amaranthe.homestead.com/files/ultimateSandM.jpg><BR>  <a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=62690'>Mondi's Stuff</a> <a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11000'>Soulstomper's Stuff</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usoulstomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulstomper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://216.40.201.155/s/contrib/sarge/Eye_anim.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/2/02 11:37:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukristinaestormrider.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kristinae Stormrider</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/2/02 9:03:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Vox/Nagafen rules posted and effective immediately.</span><hr size=1> You mean Vox in #1, right?<br>
<br>
First of all, keeping yourself under level 53 is BS just to have a shot at an epic piece.  Also, killing Gorenaire and Talendor is easier said than done.  My guild had to ally with another hgih-end guild (I forget which) to kill Gorenaire, something that at the time we ourselves would have been able to do.<br>
<br>
Then again, looking at some of the other epic encounters, this is just another mob someone has to put the effort into getting people for, and beating everyone else to her at the same time.  Woo, go Verant for making such pain in the ass quests which aren't exactly fun after the first two months or so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I still stand with the suggestion I made, though.  I don't think 52 and under people should be penalized due to their guildtag.<br>

<br>
We do not have 18 people of raidable age, but this will be my second time that I have lead, usally recruiting others to assist us. My understanding is that we will no longer be able to sign up for this? <br>
<br>
Or will my guild be one of those exceptions talked about? So far all the raids have gone fine, and we've had no problems. <br>
<br>
Why should we be denied this oppertunity to take on the dragon, because the choice of staying a small, family, social guild rather than a large raiding guild?<br>
<br>
If I decide to go on other raids chances decline, because of rules set up by the larger guilds, allowing members first, friends allies, and so on. <br>

Yes it is but it's Verant's choice for yours and paladin's epic unless you choose Gorenaire instead.<br>

What do you expect for one of the best instrument in the game for you with awesome stats and a nice proc? Not to mention you don't have to switch it out and you can melee with it. And as for the paladin epic, well, it's a bashable 2hs with decent taunt proc. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And as for the rule of people being penalized by their guildtag. Just ask yourself this, if you saw a lvl 52 bard in Watchers wanting to sign up a spot with Vox, wouldn't you think something is really wrong there? The guild your in does affect you greatly. They should be assisting you with your epic as well as you assisting them with their epics. And if your guild is filled with lvl 55-60s, you can most certainly can choose other routes of CoF/RBB, scales, and books. You may have to &lt;gasp&gt; ally with another guild to take down Gorenaire or Talendor, but leave Vox/Naggy the way Verant intended, to the 46-52 crowd.<br>

<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Unfortunately, I have to disagree on the point that the reason people raid Vox/Naggy is to get raid experience. The reason Brell's Chosen hosted Vox was simply so I could obtain that White Dragonscale. That was my only reason, plain and simple. (By the way, even though I couldn't participate in the fight, I played a friend's Druid, so I wouldn't be leading from the sidelines).<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Because Brell's Chosen was a smaller, relatively inexperienced guild, we had been discussing and contemplating whether we were able and ready to add our names to the list for dragon raids. Brell's Chosen did use this raid as on opportunity to gain valuable raiding experience.<br>
<br>
The guild member, who was not an officer, saw that the list for Lady Vox was relatively short and asked if they could add our guild to the list. The guild member stated outright that this raid was an opportunity to obtain the scale for her epic and wanted to claim it. After much tense discussion between various members and officers of the guild, it was decided that the guild would proceed with the raid and claim the scale, which did not drop, for the aforementioned guild member. Shortly after the raid, the guild member left Brell's Chosen on good terms and joined a larger, more experienced guild that was capable of taking on Gore.<br>
<br>
So I disagree with this one statement. There are still a number of smaller, inexperienced guilds that use Lady V and Naggy as stepping stones for raiding experience. I would be greatly saddened to see these two dragons removed from the list because of misperceptions about raiding reasons...<br>
<br>
Tiatiah<br>
<br>
<br>
***As a sidenote***<br>
Brell's Chosen requested to be removed and is no longer on the dragon lists due to a recent guild merger. Since I still have a special place in my heart for the guild name, I wanted to clarify what the guilds intentions were.<br>

I understand that I can make up my 18 people to get on the list by forming as many alliances as are needed with other guilds to make this first 18.  What I either missed or wasn't clarified upon was, are unguilded people allowed to count on this list of 18?  <br>
<br>
I have several close friends that are not guilded at this time and do not plan to be any time soon, they spend vast amounts of time with my guild as a whole as well and I would 100% defend their integrity.  Do I have to exclude these friends from my 18 just because a long gone guild burnt them so badly that they are too nervous to join another, when all they desire is to help us?  <br>
<br>
Before anyone responds and flames me for asking this, I also understand that I will require more people then the initial 18 and that my unguilded friends can still be a part of the raid.  My question is only to see if between the guild itself and the unguilded friends I can reserve a place on the list.  I know I could do that without forming an alliance and the other allied guild out of the rotation list until my guild's raid was over.  <br>
<br>
I'm not looking for a loop hole, I'm not striving to abuse the system  . . .heck I'm not even arguing the rules . . . I just don't want to pull another guild's chance at the old world dragons away from them . . .but I want the chance to see and kill Naggy once and for all . . I've been apart of 5 Vox raids, now it's Naggy's turn.<br>

All guilds that wish to ally and kill vox, please have your members sign up below.  Once we get teh 18 people, I will post a link for the rest of everyone that is &quot;temporarily allied&quot; to sign up.  Thanks and see you all there!!!<br>

____________________________________________________</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Now, that is what I understand and what that means is that there is a random sing up, just like before but you have to have 18 people &quot;Allied&quot; to do this in a few days time after your post.  Heck, This means it really has not changed just the wording of what you call sign up has..  No real big deal, and if enough people get &quot;declined&quot; to kill these 52 cap dragons, I bet we start seeing posts about people setting up a raid for a dragon that died a few hours earlier by an unknown raiding party.  Just my opinion though....  I like the sign ups, they make it easy to get together and plan stuff for us working stiffs that need to have a schedule.  By the same token as my and my guilds level increases I see the need fo rno lists like Trak and Gore and such.  All is going well, just have to work out the kinks.  Let me know i fI am off base on what I read into the &quot;new&quot; sing-up method though.

Alot of the guilds that have killed the Old World Dragons several times use them to train Raid Leaders. Same guild, but differant leader. I believe using Dragons in this methode is still with in the spirit of the rotation.<br>
<br>
Also, the people raiding the Dragons, many are new at it and have no idea about &quot;stacking buffs&quot; ( these are the Raiders, not the leaders ) The Old World Dragons still require buff circles of some sort to succeed. People learn from these raids about buff stacking and proper buffing for later &quot;buffing on the fly.&quot; <br>
<br>
All in all, it is still a valuable learning exp for the majority of particapents on these raids.<br>
<br>
Finally, tho, I would like to note that Twiggie has not commented on my idea of replacing &quot;Main charactor&quot; with &quot;Active Charactor&quot; to better discribe who qualifies for the 18 on the intent list.<br>
<br>
He asks for suggestions and I think one up then get no comment on it. /boggle<br>

It's like the kid sittin in back going &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
From reading the raid rules it is clear that indies are excluded from sponsoring a raid. This would include co-sponsoring one with a guild. Therefore indy friends cannot make up the rest of the 18. <br>
<br>
Aidyan, just because people are posting intents like that doesn't mean they are following the rules, or that twiggie will accept their post. The rules state that you and another guild can ally, not that random people from several smaller guilds can just sign up on a sheet. <br>
<br>
Posting to find another guild to ally with is acceptable, having a bunch of random people wouldnt be under these rules. <br>
<br>
So, the problem is in people understanding or not reading the rules fully I think, not in the rules themselves.  <p>60 Warlord<BR>

Twiggie responded to it with:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If you wish to offer an alternative then I'll gladly listen to it. But I'm not really going to debate opinions because there isn't much point, because its generally a futile effort. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, I offer an alternative. Once I do i hear nothing from him about it. The alternative makes his own understanding of agreeing with me with the Necro/Paladin I brought up not an exception but part of the rule. The only way to keep hypocracy out of administration of the rules is to make the rules so that there is no hyprocracy involved in them.<br>
<br>
If Twiggie can see my example as being a convencing exception, why does he refuse to even comment on my suggestion so he has the rules to back up his discisns? &quot;Active Player&quot; is exactly what the Paladin in question is. &quot;Alt&quot; is also a fact of what that Paladin is. Does anyone have &quot;Two Mains&quot;? <br>
<br>
I am trying to help Twiggie, yet all I see a bunch of BS. I have offered a crompromise and reasons why such is needed. Sure, I did it bacwards and offered the reasons first, but I got around to the other. What the heck does he want?
