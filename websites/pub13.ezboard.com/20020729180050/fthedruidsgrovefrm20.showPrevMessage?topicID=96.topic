In general, I would say one group per level is reasonable, beyond that there will be a lot of down time.  Especially if multilple groups are sitting in the same areas trying to get a key.....not sure if it is still a problem, but getting the key off the angry librarian always seemed to take FOREVER.

<br>
given an average raiding level of 35-45  the lower floors can support:<br>
<br>
floor 1  -  crowded with one group!  pull till tou get a key and move on!<br>
<br>
floor 2 - COULD support 2 groups hunting here for xp, but the drops are not spectacular, so ONE group usually pulls to the zone in.<br>
<br>
floor 3 - same as floor2.. COULD suport 2 groups, rarely does. most folks will camp the bloodpool / escape hatch rooms  or move on.<br>
<br>
Floor 4 -  about the only sharable level.  can support upto 3 groups.  zone in, zone out, and left side.<br>
<br>
floor 5 - one group, cus the wedding party is about the only viable camp.<br>
<br>
===========<br>
Now we start to get to the higher group area.. shift to a group of 45-50s<br>
<br>
Floor 6a - again, not many drops, but if yer here for xp,  .. I could see 3 groups  zonein, left specs,  right specs<br>
<br>
Floor 6b - Bossmob (ValShere)  one solid group or 2 mid 40s groups to kill.  basically one big room<br>
<br>
Floor 7 -  could probably support 2 groups... rarely see more than one raid team up here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxendrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xendrix</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 507<br> <font color=#333399>(5/18/01 4:03:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tower of Frozen Shadow</span><hr size=1> Three groups in 6a would get quite crowded.

  The key situation for the tower is kind of rotten. They<br>
  are NOT soulbound objects! If you die or get wiped out<br>
  you have to either know someone with the keys or get a<br>
  whole new set (which can take several hours). If you have<br>
  a well balanced group you should really have no problems.<br>
<br>
  As for the floors:<br>
  #1 Can support one group - get Key, next floor please.<br>
  #2 Can support two groups - there are enough mobs to kill<br>
     with a pretty good respawn rate.<br>
  #3 Can support two groups - see comment for #2<br>
  #4 Can support two groups - there are plenty of wandering<br>
     mobs. Be careful, with the exception of a few mobs on<br>
     the 7th floor I'd probably have to say that this is<br>
     the most dangerous floor on the tower. The wandering<br>
     ooze can actually hit pretty hard for its level and<br>
     even at level 58 I still get exp off some mobs in this<br>
     level.<br>
  #5 The wedding - one group of mid/high 40s can have a lot<br>
     of fun here (not to mention some really good loot)<br>
  #6 Two groups can live here<br>
  #7 Two groups can live here - typically one will camp<br>
     Tserrina and the mobs out in the main room. Another<br>
     group can camp up from the floor's entrance and pull<br>
     wanderers and stuff. The bats spawn Vamps/Tserrina<br>
     which ARE the most lethal things in the dungeon and<br>
     I'd recommend two tanks as they have some pretty<br>
     hefty resistences.<br>

I was at the Tower this weekend with my 35, 36, 37 enchanter (good exp there!). We got probably 6 Ro's Fiery Sundering over 8 hours or so. It dropped on 3, 4, and 5 off random mobs... but the suits of armor (sentintal shadow?) on 3 seemed to drop it the most. Probably just coincidence. Oh, and I lost count of the number of Tumultuous Strength spells we got. Ended up selling them to vendors for 6pp each.<br>

  Oh yeah, last but not least. If you want to have<br>
  some real fun in here the golems that ButeaoRegalis<br>
  posted about a awesome for practicing AE killing.<br>
  Just pull them all, get them close and mez. Upheaval<br>
  and Earthquake from the druids/clerics, wizzies use<br>
  their AE spells and chanters cycle through AE stuns.<br>
  You'll drop them all in about 30 seconds or so. I say<br>
  practice because the number of mobs is limited, no<br>
  wandering mobs/trains to worry about. AE killing, as<br>
  some may or may not know, IS a little risky but when<br>
  you can make a 3 blue in two hours at level 58 in<br>
  Sebilis it is worth it. (My personal group record is 18<br>
  frogs though other groups have dropped as many as 30)<br>
<br>
  Just a suggestion for a little fun. I'd recommend high<br>
  40's low 50's for the 5th floor trying this. When you<br>
  feel confident with the golems then I might try the<br>
  wedding party.<br>

I mean the guests at the wedding are a joke and drop like flies.  Also, if you decide to kill the golems, just remember that the undead one will ALWAYS spawn the enraged relative which is one of the meanest things in the tower IMO.  Especially at the level that you are fighting it.  I would put it only behind VhalSera and Tserrina in difficulty.<br>
<br>
When we went up, we made sure that a caster was the primary key holder.  If things looked bad, they were to gate out.  This worked every time but once, and then we needed to call in a friend that had keys to help us with the recovery.  As you go, others get their keys, etc.<br>
<br>
I also did a little ground work after that incident knowing that we would be hunting there.  I took my druid in and soloed my way through to get the keys to up to level 5.  He was then always there as a backup.  The enraged relative resisted all root/snare attempts, so I had to park there and loot one of his keys after the main group killed him as well.<br>
<br>
Once you are familiar with the tower, the only place that you should really ever need to worry about a total group wipeout is on the 4th floor, maybe the 7th but I cannot say on that one.  The others are relatively safe unless someone in the group trains you.&lt;G&gt;<br>
<br>
The tower can be so nice that you will eventually get sick of it and have to hunt elsewhere for a while because you spend so much time in there.  Outside of the keys being such a pain, the overall setup is very nice.<br>

This thing hits hard and fast. We killed it a few times with this group:<br>
<br>
36 Druid<br>
36 Warrior<br>
37 Enchanter (my alt)<br>
35 Warrior<br>
45 Cleric<br>
<br>
However, we did have a 54 cleric sitting there as a backup healer. I don't know how it would have gone without him there, but I'm reasonably sure we would have taken the enraged relative either way. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure whether the enraged relative has a lot of HPs, or whether our tanks just couldn't hit it for decent damage (it was several levels red to them). Whatever the reason, fights lasted a long time relative (no pun intended) to anything else we encountered. (although Cara gave us a run as well).<br>
<br>
CR is indeed a challenge in the tower. The worst is the fourth floor (my limited experience again) due to the occasional mummy that sees through invis. My guild was there over the weekend with two groups of 34-45. The 4th floor group got wiped out. The lower level group went up to do CR and half of them were killed.<br>
<br>
We got a nice group of 50-54 druid, pally, and cleric to help us with the CR the next time around (along with a 51 druid from our guild who had a dead alt on 4). I went along with my 37 enchanter for Clarity when we got rezzes underway. A mummy saw through my invis and I gated out. Same with the 51 druid from our guild. The other three made it to Cara, got it under control, and started rezzing. All in all it took a bit over an hour to do the CR.<br>
<br>
I'll add a few more comments about the tower... <br>
<br>
I agree it's a very cool zone. Zoning in to level 4 (and to a lesser degree level 3) feels like a mini planes break-in. It's good experience for 35-45 before doing planes.<br>
<br>
Sometimes a mob will follow you through a mirror. We had a shade follow us from 1 to 2, and saw someone pull a ghostly student from 2 to 3. However, I had 3 or 4 shadows on me when I zoned from 4 to 5 and they didn't follow. Could just be random.<br>
<br>
If you have to do CR I agree with the group that helped us do our CR. They said, &quot;If your invis drops or you are seen, gate out or die.&quot; It's easy to pick up 6+ shadows and mummies on the halls of level 4 if invis drops at the wrong time. Even with an enchanter, it's just too hard to target eight &quot;a shadow&quot; packed into a small corrodor. AE mez works, of course, but with that many it's just a matter of time before the chanter goes down (resists and mez breaks) and the rest of the group follows. I'm speaking, of course, of an experience group of level 35-40. Higher level groups can do it, naturally.<br>
<br>
It's natural to want to get a key and power your way up. However, unless you have help lined up in advance, I would suggest having two sets of keys per group, with one player keeping his or her set in the bank. That way you have at least a chance of pulling off the CR if things go bad.<br>
<br>
This is just about the most fun I've had in a long time. I recommend the tower to anyone 35+ and am constantly trying to get guildmates to go.<br>

<br>
In our first group we had:<br>
44 Enchanter<br>
44 Druid (healer)<br>
39 Druid (snarer, nuker)<br>
30 Druid (backup healer, nuker)<br>
35 Warrior<br>
35 Ranger<br>
<br>
The second floor was pretty easy for our group, but we had to share the floor with another group until we got our key. It took maybe 20 minutes before we received the key.  We usually pulled multiple mobs and easily handled them.  Two groups on this floor was too much.<br>
<br>
The third floor wasn't too bad, just be prepared for multiple pull mobs.  Most pulls contained two mobs, but occassionally three which our Enchanter just mezzed them until the tanks were ready. We just stayed at the zone in point until we received the key.  Only one wanderer would pass by and usually didn't cause any problems unless we were already engaged in battle. Two groups on this floor was too much, especially if you wanted experience.<br>
<br>
The fourth floor kept us hustling from the time we zoned into this floor. There were considerable amount of wandering mobs and during a battle adds were common.  Needless to say since we didn't have a Cleric when things got real ugly and they did, we Evac'ed out of there.  All 3 of us had an EVAC spell memmed.<br>
<br>
We went in 2 more times with a little different group combination.<br>
<br>
44 Druid<br>
44 Enchanter<br>
35 Ranger<br>
<br>
We put on our invis vs Undead on floor 1 and then just proceded directly to floor 3.  The three of us were able to hold our own on floor three with few problems. We fought on this floor for about an hour with little trouble.  We did evac out when both the Druid and Enchanter became LOM and I was low on HP.<br>
<br>
The next combination was:<br>
44 Druid<br>
44 Enchanter<br>
35 Ranger<br>
35 Warrior<br>
<br>
This combination worked much better on floor 3, because the Druid didn't have to heal the Ranger(myself) as much and we inflicted damage quicker.<br>
<br>
We decided to go to the fourth floor again to attempt to obtain an additional 5th floor key.  We stayed at the zone in point and managed to kill the first couple of mobs we encountered.  Then we had to many adds (i.e. Mummy's and Goo (ooze)) so we were forced to Evac again.<br>
<br>
Now that we have a better understanding of what the zone looks like we can line up a more balanced group.  We will then be prepared to move from the fourth floor up.  We already a 5th floor key, but none of our groups were balanced enough to make it that far.   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>

That is just asking for trouble.  One time we tried that and ended up fighting adds for at least 15 straight minutes.  Get into one of the passageways where there are fewer adds to join in.  You will greatly reduce the wanderers this way.  Just invis up before going through the mirror to 4 and you should be able to move into the passgeways without much of a problem.  We usually take the passage right beside the door to the mirror to the right there.  Once you are in there, you will have 1-2 wanderers to deal with.<br>
<br>
If you want to do Cara, you can just invis all the way to her room and set up your camp in there.  That is a pretty safe camp area, and you can pull to that room.  Very few wanderers ever pass through that room.<br>
<br>
In case you were not aware, if Cara is not up, Amonepheta and Narma Baraka (sp?) are the placeholders.  Kill one of them, and one of the others will spawn.  Narma is a SK suit, and Amon is a mummy warrior type.  The problem is when they are to the left side from the zone in point.  It can get ugly over on that side to put it mildly.  Lots of wanderers and no real good place to set up a good spot to fight from.<br>
<br>
FWIW, outside of the enraged relative, the 5th floor is so much easier than the 4th since you can pull everything 1-2 at a time.  The wedding guests look like if you pull one you will get the whole lot of them, but hit the one on the end closest to you, and you should only get 1-2 at most.  Pulling the actual bride and groom will get you both and maybe the priest depending on the level of your puller.  Still, they are not overly difficult.  Kill the priest first if they come since he will heal.  Only problem I could see is if the enraged spawns on you during a fight like that since it will require your full attention if you are a lower level group.  Killer experience there for a lower level group though.<br>

By ellocopato<br>
<br>
The First Floor:<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
Upon entering the tower the first things that you will notice is a huge hole in the floor and many doors. <br>
<br>
Directly infront of you will be a door with two banners hanging from the sides.<br>
Specters called “Lesser Ice Shades” spawn on either side of the door. They have a very slow respawn rate however, remember this door for later reference.<br>
<br>
Traps Warning: <br>
Careful the floor is very slippery and inside the hole are 3 shadowbone skeletons that think you very tasty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proceed to the second left-hand door, inside this room are many shadowbone skeletons, kill them then camp the hallway of this room. Pull as you like from the other rooms. <br>
<br>
Eventually one of two things will happen: <br>
(1 The Rare will spawn in one of the rooms <br>
(2 The Keyholder will instaspawn once what you’re killing is dead. <br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “A Large Undead Gnoll” and drops the Crystal Key, the key to then next level.<br>
<br>
The Rare is “Xalgoti” a named Shadowbeast, he drops Crystallized Shadow Tunic rarely.<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the double bannared door previously mentioned. On the left-hand side is a port to the 7th level but needs a key from the boss mob of the tower so skip it for now, and head to the right-hand side. Put the key on your mouse cursor and make sure your entire group is close to you, and hit U (Note for multiple raid groups you’ll need a key for each group it only takes up the groupmembers of the keyholders’ group).<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The mirror out on this floor is right behind of port in.<br>
<br>
The Drops on this level:<br>
Various Gnome Skin Armor (Crappy AC with Poison resist looks like pure black cloth with no designs.)<br>
Various Fading Shadow Weapons<br>
Shadow Bone Earrings (4 Agi 2 Int)<br>
And Various Crystallized Armor (Low ac high stats)<br>
A Crystal Key<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
The Second floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Upon port up you will enter an old library filled with Erudite Ghosts. Buff up MR immediately and switch on Resist gear, because nearly everything on this floor casts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trap Warning:<br>
There is a bookshelf on the right-hand side of the Port Up that screams like a cougar and will claw you. Rogues can disarm this. It will not follow you, so more of a little flavor trap.<br>
<br>
Now you can either sit at port in and pull to there or wander around killing the erudite ghosts. There are way too much spawn on this level to point out but they’re nearly all Necromancers, Magicians, Wizards, or Enchanters. <br>
<br>
There are a few static spawns I should point out, on the booth infront of port in are the Librarian and The Librarian Assistant, these both don’t drop anything special other then crystallized but are named. The second is a hut left of the Port up, inside is a Ghostly Teacher and a Student, both drop nothing.<br>
<br>
Kill the ghosts and eventually one of two things will happen:<br>
(1 the keyholder will instaspawn once your target is dead<br>
(2 The Rare will spawn.<br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “A Angry Librarian” and drops the following<br>
<br>
Angry Librarian:<br>
<br>
The Three Toothed Key (Always)<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The rare is “Zorglim the Dead” and drops crystallized pieces uncommonly and sometimes rarely a Crystallized Shadow Tunic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the next level, to get there head straight out from port in to the door and follow the hallway to the mirror, put the key on your coursor and click U.<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The Mirror Out on this level is on the far left-hand corner, there is a bookshelf, click on it to move it aside but be careful because 2 Students guard behind it. Kill them or run around them and click on the mirror. <br>
<br>
<br>
Drops on this level:<br>
Various Crystallized Armor Pieces<br>
Various Fading and Velium Weapons<br>
Various Gnome Skin Armor.<br>
Teachers Syllabus<br>
Student’s Homework.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
The Third Floor:<br>
----------------<br>
**I need more info on this floor I haven’t been on it very long at all **<br>
<br>
Upon the port up to the Third floor you will find you have entered a creepy manor type décor. <br>
<br>
Trap Warning: No traps on this level that I know of but there are a lot of fake walls.<br>
<br>
Proceed right of the port in area killing anything in the way. Ignore the doors on the sides, sleepers sometimes spawn there but otherwise they are empty. <br>
<br>
Eventually you will come upon a room with Shadowbeast cooks, pull them and kill, turn left and head straight until you come upon a room with a big Table in the middle. Camp here and pull the other rooms to here and eventually one of two things will happen:<br>
<br>
<br>
(1 The Keydropper will instaspawn on what you’re killing.<br>
(2 The Rare will spawn.<br>
<br>
The Keydropper is “An Enraged Shadow Beast” and it drops the following:<br>
<br>

The Rare is “An Enraged Cook”<br>
<br>
Note: Some people confuse the cook with the enraged beast, I think maybe prepatch they were switched but as it stands now the drop info is correct for the Beast but I’m not sure on the cook. **Need help with Drop info on the Cook**<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the Mirror to the next floor. Proceed straight up the tunnel that led you to the Dining Room. Ignore any turns and kill anything that jumps you, go straight until you cant anymore then follow the tunnel to the mirror. Put the key on your mouse cursor but make sure your group is good mana and hps cuse the next floor is nasty. Hit U once those conditions have been met.<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
Bedroom with zombie maids. Turn right, then left at the shadowbeast room. It's all the way down this hall, last entryway on your right.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Things that drop here:<br>
Various Gnomeskin Armor<br>
Various Crystallized Shadow Armor<br>
Various weapons including crystallized, fading, and velium.<br>
Finely Crafted Velium Ring<br>
Chilled Scythe<br>
Frosty Key <br>
<br>
 <br>
The Fourth Floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
As you port in you will notice you are in a brick maze, it’s mostly like a crypt. Buff your MR and Disease Resistance because The Shadows on this cast nasty spells, and the Ancient Mummies Proc Disease. Make sure to switch on your Resist gear! Be prepared to fight because there are many wanderers<br>
<br>
<br>
Trap Warning: If you go the wrong way there are fake floors that drop you into a room with a few mobs, run into the fire in the center and you will be teleported to the port up area.<br>
<br>
Early Mirror Out:<br>
From the port in on your right is a White door, you can open this with either the key from the previous level or Lockpicks. **not sure skill worked for me at 200 lol** behind it are 3 mobs, kill them or run by them and there is a Mirror at the end of the tunnel, click on it and you will zone out.<br>
<br>
<br>
This maze is tricky, I offer you both a map link and directions<br>
<br>
Link: www.eqmaps.com/mapz/tower_level4.jpg<br>
<br>
Directions: <br>
Ignore the white door and take the first right you see, follow this tunnel but ignore the right turn you’ll see, this is a dead end with a mummy. Continue straight and ignore the left turn into a fake wall. Continue straight and you will come upon a single shadow, kill it and make sure you have a lot of mana and health. Next move up or pull the 4 Shadows and fight them. <br>
<br>
When rested head straight through the fake wall where the shadows hung out. There is sometimes a wanderer in this hall, kill it head straight and enter the mummy room. Cara Omica could be spawned in the empty coffin so be prepared. There is also a mummy that spawns in here if I remember correctly. This is your camp area. Sit down and pull the other rooms to you. Infront of you is the mirror to the 5th level, and 4 shadowmen in sets of 2.<br>
<br>
Spawn Order:<br>
Now there are 3 nameds on this level, and this is how I believe you spawn them.<br>
<br>
(1 Pull and kill till Narmak Berreka or his PH spawns. If his PH spawns start over from (1<br>
<br>
(2 When you kill Narmak Amonepheta or his PH will spawn, if his PH spawns kill it and start over from (1<br>
<br>
(3 If you kill Amonpheta, Cara Omica will insta spawn in the coffin. Kill her and she will trigger Narmak Amonpheta or Herself to spawn in a few minutes. <br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “Cara Omica” and she drops the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Cara Omica:<br>

The Fifth Floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
When you port up the first thing you should notice is Golems in Ice Pillars. You have arrived as an unwanted guest at an Undead Wedding.<br>
<br>
Trap Warning: No traps on this level. Have fun.<br>
<br>
It would be best to explain the spawns first. <br>
Unlike the other floors, the rares always respawn in the same area, have no PH. <br>
On any of the kills the Keyholder can Instaspawn, the Keyholder is “An Enraged Relative” and the rares are “Nosja” and “Daman” but its best to point out Ceremonial Wedding swords drop off all the guests rarely. Drop Information for them as follows:<br>

How to tackle this floor:<br>
<br>
Proceed to pull the Golems two at a time or if you have a high level with you have them hit them with a spell and single pull them. <br>
<br>
Once all the Golems are pulled Proceed to the opening to the wedding. Rest here at the door and you have many choices. You can either pull the wedding guests all at once and AoE them or you can try to pull a little at a time. These are pretty low level (half green to 40 half blue) try to kill them all first. <br>
<br>
Now you should have the bride (Daman), the groom (Nosaj), the priest, two undead dancers, and a spawn or two in the back.<br>
If you have a high level, single the Groom, then the Bride, then the Priest. If not pull them and kill in this order: Priest first, then Nosja, then Daman. Priest is a Cleric, Nosja is a Necromancer, and Daman is a Shadowknight (Harmtouch)<br>
<br>
Kill all the rest in the room then you have several options:<br>
<br>
(1 Stay in the room and wait for repop Ignoring the back spawn eg. Golems<br>
(2 Move back to port in and kill them as above.<br>
(3 Stay in room and pull out the cubbies<br>
(4 go upstairs and camp the Golems Above while waiting for repop.<br>
<br>
Or a combination of that.<br>
<br>
Once you have the key and wish to go ahead to level 6, Proceed to the Side room with Golem Ushers in it. Bout 1/4 of the way around the circle going counterclockwise from the zonein put the key on your cursor and hit U. <br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The mirror out on this floor is very simple, when you port in turn around and it’s on the wall behind you.<br>

An Incoherent Spirit. Kill him and randomly a Coherent Spirit will spawn. He's for a Kael Drakkal quest, nice reward. He can be found if you go all the way straight from the zonein (to the wall/banner), then turn right and right again.<br>
<br>
A incoherent spirit spawns on level 6 at the aforementioned place, has a rare drop "Abram's Axe of the Stoic", really nice melee weapon. Rare instaspawn off of incoherent's death is an npc quest ghost "lucid spirit of Abram". Part of a long and involved quest from Kael/Wakening. Lucid initially cons indiff to any faction when first spawned but will aggro when attacked and/or if you are fighting a mob near it.<br>
<br>
Proceed to forward killing anything that gets in your way and you come into a hallway with many turns and directions to take. Head right killing anything in your way, or camp here and pull the right till clear. <br>
<br>
Once the beasts are dead proceed up the stairs until you get to a platform above a library. Stay close, don’t fall off or get close to the edge or you will argo the Ice shades below. There are 3 beasts<br>
In the door to the platform, kill them and then rest up. When you are ready have each person on the raid click the mirror (no keys are needed)<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out on this level is hard to explain, but from port in head straight ignoring the first left, then take a second left. This should hopefully lead you to a room full of ice shades. Invis or pull them and kill. <br>
<br>
Avoid the Dragon Statue AT ALL COSTS stay away from it, it casts a nasty AoE that dropped our fully cleric buffed 53 warrior 2 bubs in seconds. If you are invis, hug the left wall all the way around till you get to the hallway out. Follow the hallway and click on the mirror to be transported out of this hellish room.<br>

How To Spawn Vhal Sera <br>
Here is how VhalSera works on the 6B floor. It is a triggered spawn. It does not come from killing bats, which I've done for 6 hours straight thinking that it may spawn.<br>
<br>
When you enter 6A, go straight until you hit the wall. Don't turn at the first intersection. Once you hit the wall, go left to the room with the (8?) ice shades and the Dragon statue AOE trap. Set up camp just before the room so that you don't constantly get hit by the trap, and have a caster pull so no puller gets nailed by the trap either. It will do a large amount of damage and dispell a buff or two.<br>
<br>
The mob that triggers VhalSera to spawn is located in this room (and possibly the other room with ice shades that is located below the mirror to 6B, but I have not confirmed that). I believe the exact name of the ice shades here are "a ice shade". The trigger to make VhalSera to spawn is called "an ice shade" (or if I'm mistaken, it's the other way around). It will look like a Spectre. It won't have a white graphic on its cuffs nor on its hood. It will be straight black, and if you let it stand around for long enough it'll cast a little skeleton pet. It took us a couple spawn rounds to finally get this one to spawn.<br>
<br>
Once killed, VhalSera immediately spawns on 6B. It spawns in the first green floored room, right in the middle (right where the bats like to stand around on top of eachother). Don't forget to make sure that no one is camping 6B or else you're going to spawn the geenie for them and then get fairly pissed off when you go up to find that they profited from your camping. <br>
<br>
One final thing - ID the item(s) on VhalSera. They come out pretty funny.<br>
<br>
If you the shrouded bats that lurk around here, once they are slain killed they spawn Enraged Vampires, which are very mean. <br>
Both mobs process Full Stamina Drain on there target, also the vampires cast many nasty spells including Grav Flux.<br>
<br>
Head up the bridge and proceed through either door, killing all the bats on the way. You will eventually get to a room with a Hand holding a ruby. <br>

The Seventh Floor:<br>
-------------------------<br>
This floor is basically a long black brick corridor. It turns, but there is only one route it can take. <br>
<br>
Traps Warning: <br>
There are some traps near the beginning when you come to a pillar (there is a trap on either side of the pillar). No idea what the trap does as rogue disarmed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every so often you will come to a drake, these can be pulled solo and were green at 52. <br>
<br>
After about 6 drakes you will come to a doorway on your left that opens to a large(ish) room with a spiral staircase in the middle, and about 6+ spawns around the room. Some of these were blue at 52. If you go up the staircase there are some rooms and a room of mirrors (I believe, warrior scouted). <br>
<br>
However, on the wall opposite where you came into the spiral staircase room is a banner, that is a fake wall. Walk through.<br>
<br>
You will now be in a smallish corridor. It has 4 rooms coming directly off it, one on the left, then one on the right, left then right. At the end is a small circular area where nothing spawns. In each of the 4 rooms a bat spawns, when you kill these there is a chance that the boss of the zone, Tserrina, will spawn.<br>
<br>
Tserrina is level 50, and totally magic resistant. NOTHING would stick to her when we fought her. She blinds, and I heard that she charms sometimes.<br>
<br>
Hint: when we fought her she ran, and because we couldn't get snare to stick she ran back into the spiral staircase room where there was a full spawn =) Managed to kill her tho before we had to evac. I highly suggest you keep that first room clear as you work your way through the 4 bats.<br>
<br>

There are serveral mirrors out in the room with many mirrors.<br>

<br>
Just going to add just one thing that I have found useful in the Tower.<br>
<br>
 AOEs.  Scary eh but you be amazed how effective AOEs are in here.  Standard group I am usually with is a 54 druid, 50 wizard, 53 cleric and 2-4 variety of classes (I am 55 Shaman).   We actually move rapidly thru the tower from 1 - 4 in record time (have keys, do not waste time slaughtering all before us, blah blah blah..heh).  The bottleneck we found to 5th floor where the fun is (btw recommend 4th floor for excellent hunting from mid 30's to mid 40's) is on the 4th floor at the point where you come across 4-6 mobs all together.  Pretty hard to single pull them and they tend to have a high agro radius.  Usually we just tried to fight thru them with group taking damage from them and having major downtime after fight.  Now here I give credit to Brairwolf, the 54 Druid, for coming up with AOEs.  Basically he used Upheavel along with the cleric.  The wizard would toss her point blank AOE after too to mop up.  My god it was gross.  The usual long fight was over in 1 min.  Next place we found AOEs great for was the wedding.  The wedding party per se (not bride/groom) do not agro you.  You can move up to them w/o a care.  Again here have 2-3 people crank AOEs and you can take down most if not all 8 zombie mobs there.   Frankly AOEs are effective in the tower and I do recommend you use them.  Just make sure 2 people are doing AOES so agro is not all built up on one person.<br>

<br>
Floor 1 - Purely there to give you keys<br>
Floor 2 - Purely there to give you a key and let high level Necro's farm homework and syllabus.<br>
Floor 3 - Not many creatures but probably good exp to one group around level 35.<br>
Floor 4 - As said above two groups around 35-40 could get exp here. Can get a lot of adds from wanderers though. Normally I steam thru from one named to Cara and on to level 5 with 3 level 50+.<br>
Floor 5 - Wedding plus Golems would be great exp for a 40+ group. At 51 my Necro can solo the level with the exception of the Enraged Relative - mainly because it tends to join in on a fight that's already in progress.<br>
Floor 6 - Not been here for some reason. <br>
Floor 7 - One group level. Camped here with Ench, Cleric, Wiz, Druid, 2 rogues. Pull entire floor each time it spawns. PBAE, PBAE, PBAE. All dead in around 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
It was mentioned above that the Bats/Vampires are quite resistant (floor 7). I didn't have a single resist on Fire based DDs, Magic based dots or PBAE's like Upheaval. Wizard PBAEs landed fine as did Enchanter PB Stuns. <br>
<BOLD>Every guide I have read claims Tserrina to be completely MR. This is totally untrue.</BOLD> Wizard Lures landed for full, Winged Death landed, Scoriae landed about 1 in 4, allegedly Wildfire lands better. I am positive Lifetaps land too.<br>
<br>
Pulling mobs thru a mirror can be pretty bad. Two friends and I charged from floor one to floor 4 without stopping and ended up with 3 students from floor 3 and a couple of armours from 4 plus 1 where we zoned in and had 2 adds. Was fairly hectic to kill them all!<br>
<br>
The enraged relative on floor 5. The PH for this is ANY of the undead mobs and not the golems. It was still exp to me at 57.<br>
I don't know at what level you can solo pull stuff in this zone but at 51+ (maybe lower) you can single pull the wedding. If your group is high enough to single pull you are probably tempted to PBAE them. Don't waste the mana though. Pull the bride/groom/priest. These are the only three that can heal or cast in the room and the only ones with proper drops. Take them down one at a time. Now who cares how long you take to drop the rest of the wedding unless you are desperate for keys. One level 49 pet can solo the rest of the wedding. I just send the pet into the room to attack one mob at a time. The others won't assist. in a couple of minutes the wedding is all dead and no mana used.<br>
If you are after the keys in this level and the wedding party didn't spawn the Enraged Relative then the PH must be one of the undead dancers around the outside of the level.<br>
There is one other rare spawn on this level. The Head Usher. He is blue at 55 and is a ShadowKnight. He dropped the Crystallised Shadow Legs once and nothing once.<br>
<br>
Loot doesn't seem to be so clear cut on all the mobs as Common, Uncommon, Rare.<br>
Cara: 6 kills - 3 bowls and 3 daggers.<br>
Nosja: 40-50 kills - 4 Diamond Wedding Bands<br>
Daman: 40-50 kills - 2 Rune Etched Wedding Bands<br>
Enraged Relative: 10 kills - 9 Helms, 1 Tunic.<br>
<br>
I have looted Lace veils from Daman, Nosja and the Priest at the wedding. They're pretty common (seen about 20).<br>
<br>
Tserrina: 8 Kills - 7 Symbols, 8 Harnessed Soul Gems, 1 Staff, No Robes, No Whips.<br>
