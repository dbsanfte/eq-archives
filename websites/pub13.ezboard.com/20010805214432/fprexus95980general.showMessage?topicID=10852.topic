<br>
First, please no flames; it’s just a talk for our consideration.<br>
<br>
I am one of the few that believe Ragefire should be on a list.  But, since I am in the minority we should set up some loose guidelines of this camp.<br>
<br>
I am not saying create a list, its not wanted.  I am not saying I don't want to sit there for the mind numbing hours, if I want it bad enough I will.  I am not advocating storming others waiting there in Solb, for VI's major trick on us.  What I am suggesting is some basic guidelines.<br>
<br>
I checked on the Ragefire camp today, and to my dismay 4 other clerics were there ahead of me.  Well I had a choice, join them or come back another time.  Since I forgot my pearl, it wasn't hard to figure out......LOL.  Anyway, I spoke to the clerics that were there.  The list was impressive as 2 uber guilds, and 2 big guilds were there in line.  Names not important, just some issues.<br>
<br>
There had already been tense words before I came, since someone had been afk and actually logged (not LD) logged while in line, and refused the idea his spot was gone.  I don't know all the facts, just information that was told to me.  <br>
<br>
Since I can’t wait aprox. 300 hours on-line (4 clerics and possible 2 raids of Naggy), I was talking to one mentioning I would just try the camp after a patch.  Well that left many with hard feelings also.  Inferences to stealing the camp, defending the camp, etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
I am not advocating stealing of a camp, but some basic ground rules need to be established or this camp will explode soon.  Some simple implied threats of storming the camp are being made, and I fear it will only get worse.<br>
<br>
Since, we as a community don't want a list, I propose just 3 simple guidelines.<br>
<br>
1.  If the server goes down or a patch, then the cleric that was up retains his camp up to 1 hour after event.  This would take away the rush to log on.... then the mad dash to clear the FGs.<br>
<br>
2.  If the cleric is LD he/she will have 1 hour to reclaim his spot.  Whatever his/her place in line.  If LD happens more then 3 times in 6 hours...he/she loses their spot.  This is to discourage fake LDs.<br>
<br>
3.  The cleric may go AFK for up to 1 hour, only once in 6 hours.  This will help on bathroom and eating breaks.  Just a nice gesture.<br>
<br>
Please clerics give me your thoughts.  It's up to us to be civil and get through this crapping, boring, and tense camp.  I will be sitting down there also for days waiting for him to spawn. I don't mind the wait...it's my epic so I must wait and that is ok.  I am just trying to help a bad situation, before it gets worse.<br>

You don't have to agree with her but you should respect her tone and her reasonable statements, and not answer with the moronic, &quot;Get a fuking life.&quot;  Morkenlar, you have a problem.<br>
<br>
Deshrike, you may not be a cleric but you have a right to an opinion, the same as everyone else.  Thus people who are on civil service retirement plans vote on whether social security should be privatised; people with no children vote on school board members; people with no dogs vote for dog catcher.  I can't imagine why people continue to pull this &quot;you're not a [blank] so butt out of this argument&quot; except that it's one way of shutting other people up.  Don't fall victim to it.<br>
<br>
The_Skyfire, if people want to go about abusing other people to get what they want, they will always find wimps like me to take it from.  That leaves the fun in the game for only the mean, aggressive, and selfish.  Thank you so much. /bow<br>
<br>
Play nice policy?  I'm all for it, and I try to play nice as much as I can.  What if someone doesn't?  Apparently you want to withhold from the guy any reciprocal favor or kindness.  But how will you find out who the jerks are?  Most people try to be nice most of the time (except for Tichiwawa).  Shall we start a Jerks thread, so everyone can read everyone else's complaint of the day?  I'm afraid I would appear on that list, because five days ago when I was in the middle of a train and healing people left and right and had just announced that I was nearly out of mana, some jerk asked me to buff him.  When I gasped, &quot;No way,&quot; he began abusing me for being ungenerous and selfish.  (In fact, I think I'll tell that story more fully some day.)<br>
<br>
Lewen, would you plese justify for me the 155-hour camp that today's first-in-line cleric is being subjected to?  &quot;You want Ragefire, you camp him&quot; are some of the most unkind words I have ever heard.  The woman who started this thread has a job and school.  (By the way, Morkenlar, I think she has more of a life than you do.  At least she doesn't cruise the boards looking for places to cuss people out.)  Your no-list policy is cheating her out of that.<br>
<br>
The list isn't intended to get rid of the camp.  It couldn't.  It's to reduce 150 hours to 72, and that assumes no server resets and Naggy is killed promptly.  What's the matter with you anti-list people, that a 72-hour camp isn't enough?  She got in line when there was only one person in front of her; there are three in front of me.  I'm looking at a good 200, or conceivably even 300 hours or more, myself.  :-(   Thanks for &quot;let's have no list; you gotta camp.&quot;<br>

<br>
Believe it or not, the vast majority of times a problem has come up on this server people have reasonably and civily worked it out.  And what makes you think that these mean, aggressive people would respect a "rule" made on a message board they probably don't even read?  Just because I speak matter of factly and practically doesn't mean I don't give a @#%$.  I DO care about this issue otherwise I wouldn't have posted.<br>
<br>
So tell me... how many times have you been abused by these mean, selfish people?  How many times have you gone for something only to find someone come and take it out from under your nose and tell you to @#%$ off as they did it?  How many times have you in your EQ career been truly abused by another person who was more "powerful".  I can count that on one hand in two years.  So now I ask all you clerics, what the @#%$ hell are you so afraid of?  Afraid of investing time and not getting anything?  HA!  Coming from someone who's got a 50+ character in Everquest that's the height of @#%$ hypocrisy.  Are you afraid someone will get their first?  Beyond your control, no reason to fear that.  Are you afraid that people will be mean?  Give me a @#%$ break, mean people like ME are everywhere, if you have gotten far enough in life to figure out how to boot a computer and get on the internet you have figured out how to deal with MEAN PEOPLE.<br>
<br>
Verant made the game such that there is and always will be competition for spawns.  There always will be competition for room.  Levels.  Equipment.  Everything in the game pretty much.  Zordak is NO DIFFERENT than any other good camp or spawn or item in the game so why is this even being debated???  Clerics, just like everyone else have had to deal with camping and sharing everything from the ghoul lord in lower guk to Dragons in VP.<br>
<br>
But wait, I forgot.  Rez sticks make raids recover faster, sometimes they also make raids on ubermobs possible in the first place.  That's right, so because they make raids go faster and ubermobs possible for the group of the *clerics* choosing, these mean, selfish people will obviously favor *themselves*.  Just like *every single cleric who has made an argument over the rules of the camp* has.<br>
<br>
I could also argue that wimps always get pushed around everywhere they go, but that's an entirely different matter that I don't think needs debating. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utheskyfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Skyfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/01 9:25:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics at Ragefire bottleneck please read.</span><hr size=1> "Lewen, would you plese justify for me the 155-hour camp that today's first-in-line cleric is being subjected to?

However, camping, logging, long AFKs - all of these things mean you lose your camp, because you aren't camping it if you aren't there.  Sorry, just the truth.<br>
<br>
For those wanting a list, I will reiterate, for the gajillionth time - there is no fair way to start a list, so it won't happen.  If you want it, you camp it.  If its not worth it to you, or you can't, then that is your choice - not everyone is meant to have their epics.  /shrug<br>

You want the epic, you put in the time. For an item to have unlimited charges of the best res in the game It better damn well be worth 100 hours of camping.<br>

If you post on a public messageboard you will get to hear all our nice little opinions and comments, thats how it works. I got to hear yours too.<br>

<br>
The ragefire camp is a real pain because there are too many clerics needing the same spawn.  It seems like they can work stuff out for themselves so i am a believer that they do just that. I don't play a cleric myself but it seems most clerics are willing to cooperate with each other for the most part.  SOme of the ideas on the list do make sense in my non-cleric opinion.<br>
<br>
They shouldn't be distracted by small minded people who can only offer 4 word obsenity filled utterances on the topic.  After all, that is something a poorly trained parrot can do so just ignore the person, give her a cracker and move on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uismena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ismena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/01 1:27:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics at Ragefire bottleneck please read.</span><hr size=1> Morkenlar, I apologise for accidentally using your name when I meant someone else.  (Ask anyone that knows me; they'll tell you, I'm awful with names anyway.)  But you have done it twice, now.  You are the master of the Straw Man. You misrepresent the opposition so you can easily shoot it down.  No one thinks the epic ought to be easy.  (Well, no one I respect, anyway.)  You keep saying we do so you can denounce us as lazy welfare bums.  Would you please quit harping on that same old string?<br>
<br>
<br>
Would you all get a few things straight, please, for once?  I know it's really hard to stop flaming long enough to let the smoke clear from your brains.  Just a few simple points:<br>
===*NO one wants an easy epic.<br>
===*NO one thinks the epic should not involve hard, hard work.<br>
===*NO one has asked for a walk-up window marked, &quot;Pick up epics here&quot;.<br>
Everyone who has posted in opposition to a list has used the apposites of one or more of these as objections to having a list.  Conveniently, not one of you has bothered to show how having a list would either make the epic easier or cheaper.<br>
<br>
What a list =would= do is eliminate the fighting, the hard feelings, the abuse of powerful against the weak, and the three-deep camping.  Actually, the camp is now five deep.  Five of us sitting in line?  How many of you had to sit in a two-week-long line behind four other people to get your epic?  Don't tell me about your Uulump camp or whatever; you were free to hunt and go to bed while you were waiting your chance.  I'm betting that before I leave there, the line is more than five<br>
<br>
And as for the person who angrily said, &quot;Lewen doesn't have to defend the 150-hour camp.&quot;  Yes, he does.  And so does every other person that opposes a list.  We shouldn't have to stack five deep for this damned thing; one is good enough.  After all, the camp can last 110 hours (thanks to patches and server crashes) even without the pre-camp line-waiting.  If you think adding the line-waiting to the camp is a good thing, then I bet there's a cute little collection of whips and harnesses in your closet.<br>
