Going over pricewatch.com (this is where our last 2 computers came from) here is the list that I've come up with, along with a few questions. <br>
<br>
- Abit KG7 + Athlon XP1900+ - $392.00 <br>
- Maxtor 7200 RPM 80 GB Hard Drive - $165.00 <br>
- ATX Case with 400 watt Power supply +3 fans - $127.00 <br>
- Hercules GeForce 3 Ti500 64MB - $338.00 <br>
- Generic 16x DVD - $60.00 <br>
- Sound Blaster Live! Value - $39.00 <br>
- 512 MB 256 DDR Ram - $130.00 <br>
<br>
We would be reusing our same monitor, speakers and accessories. <br>
<br>
Here are my questions <br>
<br>
1) Is the GeForce3 Ti500 really that much better than the Ti200 for the price difference? <br>
<br>
2) I can get 1GB of pc 133 ram for only 30 dollars more than the 512 MB of DDR ram. Which should we opt for? More ram at half the speed or half as much ram at double the speed? <br>
<br>
3) Is the advantages of a 1900+ really that much better than say the 1600 or 1700? Is it worth the price difference? <br>
<br>
4) We have a PCI 128 sound card... Is it really worth it to get a better sound card? (For me personally, I do most of my playing at night when my daughter is asleep, so I have the sound turned down anyway. We also have a very nice stereo, so we don't bother playing music on our computer. <br>
<br>
5) Should I bother upgrading to Windows XP? If it was just me using the computer, I probably would, but my daughter has a lot of old games that she likes to play (the mickey mouse phonics games and such) Should I just stick with 98 right now? <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help folks, we're going to file our taxes as soon as our W2's get in (hopefully soon)<br>

So take my responses with a pinch of salt...<br>
<br>
1) Is the GeForce3 Ti500 really that much better than the Ti200 for the price difference?<br>
I heard the Ti200 can be overclocked to the 500 easily enough, if you have a decent fan.  But then I'm running happily on a Geforce2 MX-200 for the time being ;)<br>
<br>
2) I can get 1GB of pc 133 ram for only 30 dollars more than the 512 MB of DDR ram. Which should we opt for? More ram at half the speed or half as much ram at double the speed?<br>
<br>
Urgh... any compromise?<br>
I'd get somewhere around 700MB of DDR.<br>
Even 512MB seems "just enough" if you want to run Luclin with all the bells and whistles.  But if I were going for a kickass PC, I'd *definitely* get DDR or RAMbus.  So somewhere in the middle :)  If it was a definite choice between the two... I'd be getting 512MB DDR.<br>
<br>
3) Is the advantages of a 1900+ really that much better than say the 1600 or 1700? Is it worth the price difference?<br>
<br>
Probably not a very noticable speed difference, I wouldn't think.  If it's a big price gap - personally, I'd avoid it.  The difference between a kickass PC (expensive) and a super-kickass PC (the 1900, *very* expensive) doesn't actually seem that big to me.<br>
<br>
4) We have a PCI 128 sound card... Is it really worth it to get a better sound card? (For me personally, I do most of my playing at night when my daughter is asleep, so I have the sound turned down anyway. We also have a very nice stereo, so we don't bother playing music on our computer.<br>
<br>
IMO, not unless you play a lot of midis, desparately want "front access" to the audio ports, or download a lot of MP3s to minidisc.  Heck I'd still be happy with an SB16 in most cases...<br>
<br>
5) Should I bother upgrading to Windows XP? If it was just me using the computer, I probably would, but my daughter has a lot of old games that she likes to play (the mickey mouse phonics games and such) Should I just stick with 98 right now?<br>
<br>
I think some of the old mickey mouse stuff may need Win98 still.  But you could set it up as a dual-boot (the Windows setup will guide you through the process) and see how it goes.  I really like WinXP - it's totally different technology to Win98, and is generally *far* more stable.<br>

So you might want to wait a little.<br>
<br>
The live is a good sound card but the Audigy is reported to have a lower CPU use than the live.  You can find a value version of that.<br>
<br>
As for XP, you can get an OEM version of XP pro for 150.  I have become a big fan of it.  If you are planning on lots of ram 98 has problem once you get to 512 meg.  <br>
<br>
What case are you planing on gettings?<br>
<br>
If you plan to buy off pricewatch be SURE to get the price of shipping.  Many places there give low prices but high ship rates so you don't save anything.<br>
<br>
Why the KG7?  It uses the AMD DDR chipset.  The KT266a, and nforce are both faster.<br>
<br>
If your board uses DDR then you must get DDR.  If your board does not use DDR then you can not use DDR.  So you need to decide now if you are going to go the DDR route.  Personly I would and did.<br>

<br>
1) Is the GeForce3 Ti500 really that much better than the Ti200 for the price difference? </b></i><br>
<br>
It's faster.  The whole GeForce3 line is more or less identical, except for the clock speeds on the core & memory:<br>
<br>
GF Ti200:  175 core/400 (DDR) memory<br>
GF 3 "Classic": 200 core/460 (DDR) memory<br>
GF Ti500:  240 core/500 (DDR) memory<br>
<br>
The difference between the slowest and the fastest is about 30-40%, so you have to decide whether that differential is worth it for you, considering your budget.  The most "bang for the buck" comes with the Ti200.  Of course if money is no object, get the Ti500.<br>
<br>
Note that as mentioned above, GeForce 4 is around the corner, which means GeForce 3 prices should plummet in a month or two.<br>
<br>
<b><i>2) I can get 1GB of pc 133 ram for only 30 dollars more than the 512 MB of DDR ram. Which should we opt for? More ram at half the speed or half as much ram at double the speed?</b></i><br>
<br>
Depends on what you mean by "speed".  You'll have to get PC2100 DDR memory for your board, so are you asking whether you should get CAS 2 or CAS 2.5 rated memory?  I would ignore those ratings and instead pick a reliable memory manufacturer like Mushkin, Corsair, or Crucial, which will almost certainly run at CAS 2 notwithstanding any ratings.<br>
<br>
<b><i>3) Is the advantages of a 1900+ really that much better than say the 1600 or 1700? Is it worth the price difference? </b></i><br>
<br>
Well, is a 15% CPU speed increase worth $100 for you?  You probably won't notice 15% playing games, but it will make a noticeable difference in benchmarks.  If you're on a budget, the 1500 or 1600 is definitely the sweet spot in terms of bang for the buck.<br>
<br>
Also, you might want to get a VIA KT266A (e.g., Epox 8KHA+, Asus A7V266-E) or Nvidia Nforce-based motherboard (e.g., MSI or Asus) over the AMD-761 based system you're planning.  Both of the former chipsets are newer and significantly faster than the AMD 76x series.<br>
<br>
<b><i>4) We have a PCI 128 sound card... Is it really worth it to get a better sound card? (For me personally, I do most of my playing at night when my daughter is asleep, so I have the sound turned down anyway. We also have a very nice stereo, so we don't bother playing music on our computer. </b></i><br>
<br>
Yes, but for the love of all things good and natural, don't get an SB Live!, the worst-sounding, least compatible, and all-around crappiest sound card on the market.  Instead, consider a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz.  Or, maybe you can buy an Nforce motherboard (MSI, Asus, etc.) which has pretty good on-board sound and networking.  Whatever you do, do NOT get an SB Live! -- odds are, you will either regret it or not even know what you're missing.<br>
<br>
<b><i>5) Should I bother upgrading to Windows XP? If it was just me using the computer, I probably would, but my daughter has a lot of old games that she likes to play (the mickey mouse phonics games and such) Should I just stick with 98 right now? </b></i><br>
<br>
While I wouldn't get XP over 2K, either is unquestionably a huge (and welcome) upgrade from 98.   Most games should run on XP (including DAOC and Everquest), and if you have some that don't, you can maintain a dual-boot configuration with 98.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Going over pricewatch.com (this is where our last 2 computers came from)</b></i><br>
<br>
You're probably better off picking one reputable on-line vendor (such as newegg.com or mwave.com) than buying it piecemeal from various unknown vendors.  Not only will you save on shipping costs (many vendors in fact inflate their shipping costs to look good on pricewatch), but you won't have to worry about a potentially bad vendor delaying your computer.  If you insist on multiple vendors, be sure to look up any ones unknown to you in resellerratings.com.<br>
<br>
Also, don't skimp on little things just to save $5 or $10.  For example, don't buy a poorly-made case and power supply which could fail on you, or use the cheap OEM heat sink for the Athlon XP which can cause it to overheat and fail.  A very small investment in these areas can give you a far better finished product. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 1/8/02 8:55:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugallatin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallatin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/9/02 12:18:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://astro.temple.edu/~fmoffat/img/kitty6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Need some advice on computer upgrades</span><hr size=1> Hehe, Ecko, the sooner you file your tax return, the sooner you get your rebate...assuming you're getting a rebate!

<br>
(Back on topic)<br>
Beware of presuming that Athon XP 1900+ means 1900MHz - it doesn't - it's just the model number, and it actually runs at 1600MHz.  <br>
I discovered that today - spent about an hour trying to figure out why Windows said 1.53GHz on a supposed 1.8 machine I was building!  Then I found <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://athlonxp.amd.com/faq">athlonxp.amd.com/faq</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and discovered the truth...<br>
<br>
A lower MHz doesn't mean it's slower by any means, as any G4 owner will tell you, but I still think it's rather misleading/sneaky marketing on AMD's part.<br>
<br>
(Edit - ok I'm educated on this now, but I'll leave it there.  What AMD are doing is actually very helpful)<br>

If is back to the old PR ratings that Cyrix did.  Most people think MHZ=speed.  Not Instructions completed=speed.  AMD does more instructions per clock cycle than Intel but Intel has more clock cycles.  What the 1900+ is saying is that is that the AMD 1900 is about the same as an intel 1.9 ghz.  Most tests show they are being a little conservative that the 1900 AMD has a slight edge vs the intel 1.9.<br>
<br>
Try explaining to the average person  the one companies 1.5 ghz is faster than intel's 1.7 ghz.  <br>

Personally, I totally understand the "mhz != speed" thing, and it's great that AMD are trying to eliminate that.<br>
The thing is, though they're eliminating the mhz/speed confusion, they're doing it in such a way that their new 'model numbers' are *very* conveniently  positioned just above the mhz.  Very sneaky indeed, and it causes more confusion than it solves :(<br>
<br>
What got to me, was that the Windows control panel said 1.533MHz.  Thought I had a jumper wrong or something... it was annoying to go through all that, only to find the FAQ and discover that it's running just fine.<br>

Kudos to AMD for being cautious and even modest with their choice of model numbers :) <p><hr>

<br>
It's not sneaky; AMD resurrected the "performance ratings" because it would have been too costly (or maybe even impossible) to inform ignorant consumers that TWO numbers, not just one, roughly indicate the speed of the processor.  (It certainly didn't help that Intel was exploiting customers' stupidity.)<br>
<br>
I think the original justification for the new number was due to the enhancements in the Palomino (XP) over the Thunderbird (Athlon C), namely the predictive branching stuff, that makes an XP faster even at the same clock speed as a Thunderbird.  It wasn't supposed to be any sort of comparison to Intel P4s -- at least from what I read.  For example, an Athlon XP 1900+ with DDR will stomp a 1.9 Ghz P4 with DDR, and then some. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 1/9/02 10:16:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/11/02 10:29:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hahaha (part off-topic, part on-topic)</span><hr size=1> Ok, I was looking around and I found this (complete system) from <a href=http://www.ibuypower.com/product-pc/dream.htm target="_blank">www.ibuypower.com</a><br>

I would also upgrade the case to the antec.  I am a big fan of those cases now.<br>

I have also become a fan of the microsoft optical mice.  No more @#$@!!! balls to clean.  Might want to think about getting one.<br>

I have build alot of systems with Aopen in the past.  Not the fastest but very stable.<br>
<br>
Might also want to bump the DVD to the pioneer.  That one is getting killer reviews.<br>
<br>
I personaly like have a 2nd hard drive.  I put all my games on it rather than my c drive.  You get a little better performance that way.  Plus if you have to redo your system 99% of the time you do not need to wipe your D drive so you can keep things easier.<br>

P4 ... sigh.  You could probably get a sub-$1,000 Athlon XP based system which would perform better.  Also, while the new SiS chipset on that board is good on paper, I'd avoid buying a new chipset from a less popular chipset manufacturer in case problems crop up in the future.  Both VIA (p4x266) and Intel (845) have P4/DDR solutions out there.<br>
<br>
Finally, remember when you buy whole systems like that, they are usually packaging the processor around a lot of cheapest OEM junk.  That monitor, for example, is just about the cheapest 19" monitor on the market, I think.  Your hard drive, case, memory, etc. will also probably be the lowest quality possible.

Well, you listed off the 3 things that they didn't attach a brand name to.  I'll call them and ask what I'd be getting, for memory, the brand name on the case and the brand of hard drive.

A friend of mine has a PC he bought from Tiny (against my advice) and has had literally the entire machine replaced (except the case), bit by bit, over the year or two he's owned it.  Think it's been through about 3 hard disks.<br>

Nuff said really.  The way I see it.... If you want quality control, control the quality yourself.<br>
<br>
As for Intel vs AMD - I prefer the Athlon.  The new "XP" models are rather impressive.  And going by the likes of tomshardware... the actual Intel chipsets (for compatibility reasons, the one thing that kept me with Intel for a bit) don't actually perform as well.  Since Athlons generally seem to be a better cost for their performance, I'd automatically go with them.<br>
By the look of it, the P4 had the edge for a short while, but an XP 1900+ with a decent chipset (The KT266A seems good) appears to give them a run for their money!<br>

<br>
The Pentium 4 is slow and expensive.  You're paying for prestige - Intel has been around for a long time, and you also get the bragging right of having the most expensive and fastest-clocked processor currently available.  Of course, your computer will actually perform slower in most tests than an AMD-based system that cost $500 less...<br>
<br>
Pentium 4s are like SUVs.  They're big and scary, but they're unwieldy for everyday use.  They may have specialized uses, but for gaming and everyday usage they're poorly designed and much too expensive.<br>

<br>
That monitor is CRT (analog), not digital.  Even the cheapest LCD (digital) 19" monitor would be at least $1,500, and probably more.  Yes that particular model is quite cheap, but for a small amount extra, you could get a much nicer (CRT/analog) monitor, such as a quasi-flat screen monitor with a Triniton tube.  Remember that Viewsonic makes a wide range of monitors, from cheap and relatively low quality to decent quality.<br>
<br>
Besides, I thought you liked your existing monitor, so why spend money on another?  Odds are they'll really nail you on shipping, too, for such a beast.<br>
