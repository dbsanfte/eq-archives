(LONG)</span><hr size=1> ... in a city named Freeport. A little new baby, named Whispers was born. It was a sunny day. The birds where singing with their beautiful voice that morning.<br>
 Back then, his parent was noble and good people, paladins.<br>
But the bards and other happy people, who sang all day long... always impressed Whispers<br>
<br>
 Often, Whispers could get a whole day going, just watching the oh so great and good bards, doing music of all kind. <br>
His parent wanted him to be a great healer, and help the injured people, but no, he wanted to sing!<br>
<br>
 So Whispers grew up with a close friend named Rohmann... Rohmann, also a half elf. Rohmann was born to war, a pure warrior... a little misunderstood aggressive boy! Dumb he were, but strong.<br>
<br>
Those two, grew up together... Played, had fun and was best friends. A day, when they were out playing in the desert of ro - the northern part, they met a strong ranger... The name was Nalili, while Whispers played his new song, that made them run faster, they saw Nalili cast a spell, that made a giant tarantula go slow. <br>
Impressed they were. So they began to talk with Nalili, that was a little bit higher level and claimed stronger than them.<br>
<br>
 Well, they grouped up with Nalili, and they got real close friends with that mofo. First, Rohmann was a little bit jealous, cuz Nalili could take a lot of damage, and Rohmann was used to be admired for that. Though, he went from a bit hate, to strong love with Nalili...<br>
Today, those 2 are married together. And that’s why, Whispers, now refuse to talk with none of em, as he disgusts they doings... But that’s another story!<br>
<br>
 So those 3 went home to Rohmann... Resting. Nalili told about his young life, about fights against the orcs of CrushBone, a wicked place - home of the orcs.<br>
 His parents died when he was born, and his aunt raised him. A mighty druid... Protector of the forest and trees. <br>
 Nalili told about the day. He ran away from his home, away from his aunt. Away from all the high trees and big forests... He met a wizard, named Salelar. He lived with Salelar in a big city, filled with high tall people. The high elves. There, he lived and learned a lot of the wise Salelar. Master of sorcery. A day, Salelar was called from his guild, to met up in the northern part of ro, and Salelar said to Nalili, that he had to gate over there. But Nalili wanted to go with him, he had read a lot of Salelars books about other places, lands and fields. <br>
 Suddenly, Nalili stood there... Said goodbye to Salelar, with tears...<br>
Nalili began to run out in the desert, where he saw 2 young half elves, and a desert tarantula. He wanted to kill the tarantula... <br>
<br>
 Next morning, the 3 young ones went out to practices some of their skills. They went to the east commonlands... Whispers, had a cousin there, he also had to bring some mead to. Out there, they saw some dark elves attack an Inn. In a rush, they hided behind a bush. Saw the dark elves, fight the strong militia guards. They saw a dark elf, in a black robe... flowing around him! The dark elf screamed: You will die now Sergeant Slate! Sergeant Slate said cool: Hah, you will not evade me silly dark elf!<br>
<br>
 Within the next 2 minutes, there were blood all over the place... Corpses, and a smell of terror, hate and blood was resting over the battlefield. Nalili began to cry, never has he seen such a battle, and that much blood. Sergeant Slate stood back, gasping and was very injured. He sighed by the sight of some of his guard friends, lying there... dying of injuries. <br>
Sergeant Slate shouted loud: SOMEONE GET A CLERIC OUT HERE!! WE HAVE SOME REALLY INJURED GUARDS HERE!<br>
 Whispers, with great courage, ran over there… He saw Sergeant Slate, deep in his eyes. Realized how scared and frightened the usual cool and selfish guard were. Fast, Whispers disbanded Nalili and Rohmann from his group, and invited the guards. The guards, followed him… Quick he played a song, which healed a bit. Slowly, but fairly well it regenerated the guards.<br>
<br>
When 2 clerics got out there, a high elf female… and a dwarwen cleric, a really high lvl and strong one, they saw that the guards was almost fully in their normal condition. The high elf cleric, named Ramina began to heal Sergeant Slate. Who sat down, almost crying…<br>
 Whispers, saw the young a beautiful high elf… The first high elf he ever saw, and he thought she was the prettiest thing, he had ever seen! He has heard songs about beauties, but never in his so fantasised mind, had he ever imagined such a beauty!<br>
<br>
<br>
 Whispers moved a few steps closer to her, smelling her adoring and manipulating smell… Ohh my dear Bristlebane, he thought! <br>
 As he moved a bit closer to Ramina, his healing song stopped healing on the most injured guards. As he heard him scream in pain, as the healing song disappeared around him, Whispers quickly moved back near him – away from Ramina. In the second Ramina heard the guard scream, she turned her head, and saw a bard, staring and completely lost in her eyes. First she pondered him, wondering what he was up to, but realized how cute and innocent he looked like. Standing there in his own mind singing Hymm of Restoration…<br>
 Ramina beamed up a smile at Whispers… He got out of his “trance” and peered her. They both smiled to each other, until the little dwarven cleric called at Ramina.<br>
<br>
Nalili watched at the episode, saw those 2… Bah! He thought! But Nalili came up from his hiding and tried to heal a bit. But he fizzled too much and atleast he gave up, sighing.<br>
<br>
He called for Rohmann who really didn’t care about the guards, he just went to try and solo a young kodiak… Rohmann, wanted to practice his skills. Raise his lvl, get stronger and be a real warrior!<br>
So there they ran around. They got to an orc camp. There, there stood 3 angry and scowling orcs… They wanted to take them down, but they knew that they at last would get to injured with no healer. But then Nalili suddenly tracked up Ramina, just in the near… He gave her a tell, asking if she wanted to join them. And she sure did, she just had to get off from her cleric-healing lessons. So Ramina asked the dwarven cleric: Hey Mofo, can I please take off? And Mofo answered her: Yes, you can… You did well today. Take off for today, bye bye!<br>
 Ramina jumped and cheered, and within the next 5 minutes, she was there at the orc camped. She teamed up with the 3 guys, and they started to try and plan the assault…<br>
<br>
Suddenly a Kodiak came up behind Whispers… Mauled him really hard, and Whispers got really injured. Ramina quick healed him up, and the others glared at the bear. The bear’s eyes glared back, saying that it has planned killing them all… Suddenly, a big fire ball came flying in the air! Headed right into the bear… It turned around in confusion of the others looks. BLAAAAM! It tasted a fire ball, injured it really bad. And then it saw one more came, flying there… Rohmann looked the bear deep in its eyes, it looked nervous, as the fire ball got closer…! And suddenly. 3, 2, 1 – BOOOOM! It hit the bear, which were dying in pain!!! Slaughtered roughly! Short after, a little happy smiling gnomes came up at it. Looted it, and saw the 4 faces, almost dropping they under mouth, of admiration. The little gnome looked up on them, smiled… They still “stoned” before him.<br>
<br>
  Then he said: Hey, what are you guys looking at? Brrrr, Nalili shaked his head… “Wow, that was good, little man. Thanks for killing it for us”, Nalili said happy. No problem, the little gnome said with a light voice. The 4 saw his name was Nedtur. Weird name they thought, but really good to that little funny man who stood before them. High Ramina looked down, gave Nedtur a kiss on his cheek… Nedtur blushed, and smiled at Ramina. Who thought Nedtur looked cute, with almost no hair. Whispers´ eyebrows moved a bit, as Ramina kissed Nedtur… Ok, so let´s start now he commandeered!<br>
He took Ramina in his hand quickly, and got her face pointed against the orc camp. Nedtur stood there, wondering, smiling… Nedtur said: Well, if you guys and m´lady needs my help, I´ll be here for you! And Ramina replied with her soft and beautiful voice: “Sure thing Nedtur, we´ll call ya.”<br>
<br>
 So Nedtur went off again... Running to a tunnel a short place from there. Ran into and trough the tunnel, so he entered the northern part of Ro. <br>
 He wanted to go to the exotic oasis, with crocodiles, Sand Giants and the dangerous undead spectres!<br>
 There Nedtur ran around. With his small, yeah, very short legs, and his big beard. He ran to the sunrise, against the Oasis.<br>
<br>
   First he saw a caiman, “walking” besides him… It didn’t attack him. He looked down on it, saw it was about as strong as he were.<br>
He considered, if he should try and take it or not. But has he searched his mind, he found out he didn’t had that much mana.<br>
<br>
He sat at some docks, meditating… Suddenly, he heard a deep and loud voice saying, “you will little man, you´re going to die now!”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he saw a human staying before him. He could see the humans eyes glare of insanity! He thought that he was real mad in his mind, the man has probably been out in the Oasis to long! Suddenly, while Nedtur still was standing peering at the mad man, he began to cast a spell. <br>
BLAAAAAAAAM! Nedtur got really injured, but sudden… aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh, he got healed totally up! It was Ramina, she stood a little from him, healing him! He smiled at her, but quick returned to watch over the mad man. <br>
<br>
Nedtur rooted the mad man, and in a few he was killed with a lot of blasts! Nedtur smiled and winked at Ramina, meanwhile he saw the rest of Ramina´s group upon a little desert hill behind her.<br>
<br>
 They ran down to her. Whispers poked her, to kind a get her wake up from her little fantasy world. She always did that once in a while… She could stand there in ages! Just staring out in the air. <br>
Whispers greeted on Nedtur and so did the rest of the group. They all decided to invite him, and stay there… and hunt. <br>
<br>
<br>
  Next morning. The weather was warm, not really hot, but nice warm. There was an emotional sunrise, and Whispers and Ramina sat and saw it. A cool breeze felt once in a while, while the waves was pushed up against the shores. <br>
 Nalili came up beside em. Whispers were the first who noticed, and he quickly glared at Nalili. Nodding him away! Nalili smiled at Whispers, and quick ran away behind the hill Ramina and Whispers sat on. Whispers began to sing a song, about how peaceful and lovely Norrath could be, with all its joy and love. Ramina turned her head away from the ocean, looked at Whispers and said gently: “So is it gonna be the two of us?”. Whispers quick stopped singing and stared her in her glimmering eyes, and answered: “Oh yes it’s gonna be my love!”. Ramina took Whispers hand in her hand, and smiled at him. Whispers gave Ramina a quick kiss on her hand, and they both return to stare out over the ocean. Where the sunrise was in it’s most beautiful moment. <br>
 Whispers began to sing a song, he wrote the night before. While everyone was sleeping, besides him… It was about his how he wanted his life to be, with love and compassion. <br>
 Suddenly Rohmann came up, and said: “So dudes, what are we going to do today???”. Ramina glared at him, and said a bit angry: “Not anything with you, you slow lamer!” Actually she yelled at him… Rohmann stepped a few inches back, frightened! Never has he seen Ramina so upset, and he left without a single word. <br>
Ramina smiled at gently smile to Whispers… And there they sat, all the way to the middle of the day… When they got interrupted by someone shouting right beside them…<br>
<br>
“SAND GIANT COMING TO THE DOCKS!!!! EVERYONE WATCH OUT!!!!!” a guy named Fedy right beside him shouted laud! Fedy ran up beside the little camp that Nalili and Rohmann sat at. Right up at the docks… He said quickly, hard breathing: “Please get away, a Sand Giant is coming this way…!” <br>
Nalili and Rohmann got up really quick, and ran a bit away! They could see a Sand Giant´s head over a hill, suddenly they could see it’s chest, stomach, legs and there is stood. Slaying people around the docks. Whispers and Ramina was about the get assaulted by the Sand Giant, as Ramina was a bit slow to get away, and Whispers wanted to get her up! But suddenly Ramina was healed a bit up! That healed her injuries and she got able to run away with Whispers holding her hand! A lot of screams were there at the moment, Ramina leading it well!<br>
 The one that healed her was a big guy, Rohmann had heard of them. Barbarians… Tough people, hard and big. He was a shaman, a real spiritist. The Sand Giant got mad at the shaman, named Lanos, be course he helped one of the Sand Giants victims. <br>
 Lanos could run away from the docks with the Sand giant, shouting that everyone should run far away while he would drag it around until it forgot whom it hated! And Lanos did what he shouted. Far after, while everyone was sitting at a pillar, talking about what happened, Lanos salutated them. They all peered at him, and thanked him for his bravery and kindness. Fedy and Lanos smiled at each other. And grinned evilly. But nothing else… They enjoyed the people who respected them both high, as Fedy saved them be course he warned them all, and Lanos ran away with the Sand Giant. <br>
A lot gave them food and beer, and for sure Fedy and Lanos took their presents with joy!<br>
 The night fell; it began to get dark and cold. Rohmann and Whispers invited Fedy and Lanos to sleep in they tent. As the 2 didn’t have anyone themselves. It got dark, people were sleeping…<br>
<br>
<br>
…. All besides Lanos and Fedy… They both stood up, sneaking out of the tent. They began to walk a bit away. Lanos whispers to Fedy: “Damn, we’re good man! We tricked them sooooo much!” Fedy node, and said: “Yeah, that trick was well done, you’re smart Lanos. Now that those fools think we’re real nice people and have a lot of respect for us, we can begin to “use” them”. <br>
Lanos and Fedy both grinned really evil and laud, in the dark breeze of a cold night, in the exotic oasis, that at night, was totally different. The only thing you could hear, was the bugs crawling around…<br>
<br>
<br>
 Next morning, Rohmann woke up. He saw the others were still sleeping… He went outside, in the glory sun and yawned smiling. Nedtur came out of the tent too. Tripping around… half dancing or so. Rohmann raised and eyebrow of him, pondering…<br>
“Oh well, good morning Neddie”, Rohmann said yawning again. “Yeah good morning mate, slept well?” Nedtur asked… “Oh yeah, though I think I saw those 2 good guys, Lanos and Fedy go around stalking in the night and talking. Oh well, I might just be dreaming or fantasizing. Hehe” Rohmann said. Nedtur said: „ Maybe. But I’ll sit and meditate a little now… Please don’t interrupt me!” “Wont worries, I wont” Rohmann replied.<br>
<br>
 The sun was warming hot on the people in the Oasis. Crocodiles have moved themselves to the dry land, to sun them in the heat. It was almost noon… People were awake, and our little group of people packed together and decided to go south down. <br>
Rohmann was a bit upset, as he couldn’t find his bronze breastplate. A piece, he got from the first mob he killed himself. Proud he were back then... When Whispers was out, and Rohmann went to buy something in, an Inn in the north Ro. There, an orc assaulted him! <br>
 But as Rohmann was of big courage and great warrior skills, he began to fight with the orc! A rough battle, Rohmann was really hurt, but finally his rusty blade wacked down trough the orcs trout and made it die! <br>
There he stood, all alone… Killed his first orc alone, and looted it. It had a little scratched but shiny bronze breastplate that fitted Rohmann well. He turned home, and proud he were… <br>
<br>
  They entered the south Ro… Ramina had to go back to a cleric lesson. Whispers kissed her goodbye, and she went back trough the Oasis. When she reached a bit a way… She turned around, stared at Whispers and then turned to continue back into the Oasis.<br>
<br>
<br>
  “AAARRRRRGHHH!!!! You will die now you bastard!” Nalili shouted to a froglok! The froglok grinned, and jumped towards some water, and up behind Nedtur. Slashing him hard in Nedturs back!! Nedtur screamed in pain, and Lanos was quick healing him with a cool smile. Rohmann ran over in the front of the froglok, glared at him angry. Suddenly it was totally quiet, you could almost hear the hate that stood out of Rohmann’s mind! In one quick move, he slashed an arm of the froglok, which yelled in pain after it’s companions! None heard it, in the wild swamp of Innothule.<br>
 Nedtur began to cast a spell, the froglok guard noticed it, and look frightened on Nedtur, knowing that it was the end now. And the froglok died… Fedy, which came a little after and heard the froglok’s death scream. Saw and asked what happened… “Ehm, we just had a “pretty” tough battle Fedy.” Nalili said. Whispers nodded. “Yeah, that froglok guard there, assaulted us.” Nedtur said wounded, but got at his normal condition again has Lanos healed him up.<br>
<br>
“Ok, so are we going into Guk now?” Fedy asked. “Probably, but let’s rest a little here“, Whispers said, while the others agreed him.<br>
<br>
 The brave ones entered Guk. A stinky smell was spread there, and Ramina who was back turned her face be course the smell was to disgusting! Whispers took her hand… They were all a bit afraid, even Lanos and Fedy looked a bit nervous at each other. <br>
<br>
<br>
 A desert mad man jumped Fedy! He sprang out of the sand in the South Ro, and surprised everyone. Fedy got a few hits, and Lanos got him healed quick. Nalili began to cast his Snare spell, and the desert mad man got slowed down and slowly tried to run to Nalili in pure hate be course he gave him that spell… <br>
 Rohmann got in front of Nalili, he began to tease and taunt the mad man… “Grrrr, don’t you dare assaulting me dumb elf” the desert mad man shouted at Rohmann!<br>
Rohamn attacked the mad man, slashing him well down… Lanos began to cast his ice spell, direct damage! Boom, and the mad man fell down… Dying…<br>
<br>
As our friends moved more into the south ro, they met some orcs and others. They saw 3 tents, with 3 Dark elves in it… Fedy said he kinda knew em, but no one cared. They just sat there, relaxing and thinking.<br>
Whispers counted every second Ramina was gone, and missed her so much that he wandered alone out in the desert from their little spot, in the shadow from the sun – under a small palm.<br>
 Whispers sat down… Get a pencil from his right pocket, and began to write he a song about how much he missed his love.<br>
<br>
GRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!! I will destroy you small fool, a Sand Giant Husam shouted! Whispers looked up, he was knocked down… And Whispers died, in his own dreams sitting there… Didn’t realize anything before it was to late, Lanos and Nalili came out. Saw Husam, and looked frightened. Husam saw Lanos, you fool! You were the one who tricked my brother the other day, in the Oasis! DIE BY MY FLORY HANDS! Lanos got attacked hard, and even if Nalili tried to taunt him off Lanos, it didn’t work. Nalilis heal was not enough, and Lanos died…. “NOOOO!!!” Nalili cried, angered and looked up upon Husam. Who grinned evil, Nalili ran… Runned he ever could, but it wasn’t enough.<br>
He tried to hide in the small woods, but Husam found him, AND Nedtur and Rohmann….<br>
<br>
They all died…. All besides Fedy. He hided himself well in a bush, and sneaked out scouting for Husam who suddenly has disappeared. “Ack, why did this happened”, Fedy sighed.<br>
Oh well, all died… Good enough, though Lanos didn’t survive. “Hmm, so what now… Should I take all their stuff and leave Lanos and met him later?” Fedy whispered to himself.<br>
“Yeah, I think I will… They got some nice stuff, I could use” Fedy said to himself…<br>
<br>
BONK!!! Fedy got hit down in his back… He was unconscious on the ground. Tried to look up, just as he saw the face of Husam with his hand raised to give Fedy a final blow on kill him!<br>
But Fedy was quick, as Husam tried to knock him out, he rolled over and Husam missed…<br>
“WOAH, you will not evade me Fedy” Husam screamed.<br>
<br>
Fedy quick ran over to the 3 tents, began to speak uncommon… Dark elfish, the 3 Dark elves there, understood and saw Husam. They were much stronger and higher lvl than him, they rushed out on him with no fear!<br>
A few minutes after, Husams corpse were the only thing laying in the winds of south Ro.<br>
<br>
 Fedy stood alone… Saw the corpse, and puff it was gone. He pondered. And remembered what his former plan were.<br>
He searched for Whispers’ corpse, but was unable to loot it! “Grrr, I hate this consenting crap!!!” Fedy shouted. A little after he could hear Nalili shouting… “Argh, we all died!!”<br>
Fedy realized that it was to late, he had to play like he just has been hiding at all time. He quick ran to the small forest, and sat there…. Nedtur came up besides him with Lanos and Rohmann. Nalili came a little after. Looted their corpses, and they all met at their “spot” in the shadow.<br>
 All was a bit confused, and knew they died hard. Lost some experience by that, not good Rohmann said. I am almost about to delvl.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Next morning… They all sat down. Around their burned out little fireplace. “So, we going to go more south today?” Nedtur asked ?<br>
“I don’t mind”Rohmann said… “I just don’t wanna die again”. “Yeah, I agree with you”, Nalili said.<br>
<br>
They entered the swamps of Innothule… The followed the left wall, and saw a Froglok. Suddenly, Nalili rushed his mind, and shouted…<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Nedtur stared down the halls of Guk. And said: “Well, so are we gonna try and hunt here for a while?” Rohmann replied: “Yeah, heard stories of this place. Dangerous but great loots and good experience.”<br>
