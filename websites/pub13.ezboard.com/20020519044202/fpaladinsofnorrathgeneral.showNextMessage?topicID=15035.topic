EQ PvP takes more tactics, more time and the classes are much better balanced then in DAoC.  Also you are fighting for things more important, like the right to fight in certain dungeons or sometimes, even your hometown.  In DAoC, the PvP does not matter for anything really.<br><br>Levelling in DAoC is faster, but more boring.  There are much less items, much fewer and less interesting zones.  Drop rates got nerfed to EQ status also.<br><br>It's a matter of taste really.  Killing uber mobs in EQ gets pretty boring, but so does being stunned/mezzed/sniped constantly in RvR.<br><br>DAoC is a good game with potential.  It will just take a year for DAoC to begin to reach its potential. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhorammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Horammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 9:10:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14978.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://horammer.homestead.com/files/Horammer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAOC or EQ Debate</span><hr size=1> Played both and the way I look at it is this.

As noted above, DAoC is far less complex than EQ in every way, even the preKunark EQ. The DAoC paladin is better balanced than those in EQ--and is a pretty decent soloer. But to me it was much less fun to play. Like the game world, the DAoC paladin is vastly simpler than those of EQ, more like a decent meleer with some very basic bard songs (really only three that increased in power as you leveled, unsure if more have been implemented since I left). On the other hand, DAoC's lack of complexity, the ability of most classes to solo reasonably, and the absence of lengthy camps, travel times, and CRs, make it more hospitable to the casual player.<br><br>Of course, in the end it's a matter of taste. DAoC is a reasonable product, and Mythic has to get kudos for an incredible smooth launch last fall. However, I prefer the depth of EQ, where I am leaning to a full comeback. I don't have any desire to revisit DAoC. <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>Crusader of Mithaniel Marr, Level 60 (Retired)<BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvalyawanderfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valya Wanderfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 805<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 9:30:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14978.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/skfitz/valface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAOC or EQ Debate</span><hr size=1> What Marlowe said but...<br><br>&quot;Pro: Firing a catapult at a group of people&quot;<br><br>yeah that was pretty cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>the first person to &quot;discover&quot; how to make a catapult accidentally killed a bunch of their own realm mates firing it off for the first time... hehe that was pretty funny....

One thing I did realize lately in coming back to EQ was that the complexity of the EQ Paladin class makes playing a Paladin in DAoC mind-numbing.<br><br>In EQ, I can ghetto-mez (read: root), heal, buff, melee, LoH if needed, stun to mitigate damage or prevent casting, and completely control the aggro of a mob using any of the above.<br>Of course, also being unique in that I am one of the 2 classes that can reasonobly rez  (necroes can too, but.....)<br><br>in DAoC, it comes down to choose a chant (maybe twist at the cost of using styles) and hit a style occasionally.  Being a 1 handed user in DAoC, Amethyst Slash was my best move.  In fact, I really had  little use for any others (the occasional reflect/engage to help aggro control) or Back Slash to snare opponents in RvR.  For the most part, you just hit Amethyst Slash as endurance allows.<br><br>Basically: choose chant, hit Am Slash.<br><br><br>Another thing I found funny was the soloing part of DAoC.  Did anyone else notice?  You fight purples (red in EQ) to advance at a decent pace in DAoC.  In EQ you fight blues to advance (yellow/green in DAoC).<br><br>The only real difference in soloing between the games is the fact that only the cons are different.  You can level just as fast at high levels in EQ soloing low blues as you can soloing yellows/oranges in DAoC.  It's not more solo friendly, it just looks that way because DAoC essentially gives exp for mobs that EQ does not (green in EQ).  Solo killing a high yellow in DAoC is about the equivalent (in terms of precentage of level) that killing a high green/low blue in EQ is (read: cyan). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaelodyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelodyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/MojoRisenn/grouchy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 396<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 10:01:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14978.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAOC or EQ Debate</span><hr size=1> DAoC is a great game.

In particular, I felt this about the way DAoC dealt with items. Does EQ make acquiring some items too hard? Yep, no doubt about it, even for those willing to put in insane amounts of time. But I felt DAoC went too far the other way by making drops random--and generally making the player crafted items superior to drops. <br><br>While the item chase in EQ can often be frustrating, it feels great when you finally get that elusive chrome plated pigsticker that you have coveted for months.

Waiting for a guildmate to up his crafting skill to make you a slightly better sword or armor piece just ain't the same. <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>Crusader of Mithaniel Marr, Level 60 (Retired)<BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaelodyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelodyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/MojoRisenn/grouchy.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 11:26:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14978.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAOC or EQ Debate</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Waiting for a guildmate to up his crafting skill to make you a slightly better sword or armor piece just ain't the same.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Perhaps not, but it leveled the playing field. In EQ, there's a huge disparity between the haves (uberguilds) and have nots (the other 90% of the server). In DAoC, specific gear matters less. This is a good thing. It should also be noted that while player-made gear is generally better quality, dropped gear generally looks cooler/has better stats. Item degredation can be a pain, but I like it. It ensures that your equipment is always good for your level, thus helping you to remain competitive. And there are still cool things such as flaming swords to aspire to in DAoC <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucylria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cylria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 2:07:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14978.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DAOC or EQ Debate</span><hr size=1> I didn't play DAoC long enough to get into RvR.<br><br>I did have different opinions of soloing and casual players than many other posters here.

This made soloing difficult.<br><br>Everytime I logged on I almost had to find a group, or solo blues/greens for very little exp. Not good if you only have a little bit of time.

I notice there are opinions of people who don't play DAOC, or played it long ago (beta), and have NO CLUE what they are talking about. Oh well, such is such, here is the opinions of someone who DOES play both...<br><br>CONS:<br><br>EQ has:<br>Item envy<br>Camping<br>Horrible PvP<br>Uber control<br>Unbelievably long and rediculous CR's<br>Money grubbing morons who don't customer service anything unless you pay $39.95/mo. for a special CSR server...<br><br>DAOC has:<br>Unbalanced classes<br>Small fixable problems with PvP<br>Less content<br><br>In case noone noticed, DAOC has doubled in size and content from release and Mythic has NOT asked for one more red cent. IMAGINE THAT. EQ charged us $19.95 for Kunark. In fact, every upgrade cost us. $19.95 here, $29.95 there, and then to get the same consideration as DAOC now you have to pay $39.95 per month. Talk about stupid... It's your money...<br><br>As for the items, there are uber items in DAOC also, like flaming swords, cool armor, etc. There are also uber mobs, like dragons, dark knights, etc. Of course you don't like item decay, because after fighting 3 uber guilds and camping for 2 weeks for that uber item, that will be totally gimped next patch, you wouldn't want it to disappear. Instead, it only takes a few hours and a GUARANTEED drop to get an item. What a concept, more emphasis on gameplay instead of stupid items that helps noone in the long run... Yeah, I was real excited getting that Soulfire finally after 5 patches and arguing with CS that the quest was broken, and then seeing the stats that made me go back to the mithril sword. That was real great, NOT.<br><br>Then there's the uber mobs that wipeout your whole raid, and then you spend 3 hours of &quot;playtime&quot; rezing, fighting, re-dying, re-rezing, re-fighting, starting over, half the raid goes to bed, fighting, dying, rezing, waiting... You totally think boring while sitting in Fironia Vie naked for 3 hours, then having to make the trip naked because your corpse is too old... This doesn't even count fighting the uber guild(s) on the server for the RIGHT to kill said uber mob.<br><br>If you aren't able to kill the uber mob in DAOC, then walk away. No stupid 4 hour CR's that waste everyone's time...<br><br>DAOC is far from perfect, however, saying EQ is better is grossly ignorant. DAOC provides not one paladin class, but 3 paladin classes. More races and more classes. DAOC also has a 3D engine upgrade coming out for FREE which is STILL better than EQ which YOU PAID FOR AGAIN, with Luclin.<br><br>EQ is fun, and it has its perks. I still enjoy a jaunt through EQ, as long as it doesn't take 5 hours to do one thing... (Although, I did not buy Luclin, as it was wasteful to spend anything more on it) DAOC is also fun for that type of customer. Each has their own flavor, and there will be more. Shadowbane, Lineage II and others are coming. Each game will have its own appeal, so the best judge is yourself. Obviously, I, and a LOT of others, feel DAOC is FAR superior.
