Personally, i'm a big sports fan, and the biggest issue of late has been whether or not its appropriate for football games to resume this sunday.  There are two valid sides to whether it should and shouldnt be played.  Maybe others see it differently, but imo baseball is no longer America's sport.  Pro football has become the most watched and most popular sport in our nations sports entertainment today.  <br>
<br>
Like i stated there are two very valid sides to whether or not it should be played.  One side states that its too early, and they shouldnt play as a gesture of respect for the tragedy that occured.  Some say its disrespectful to play games while bodies are still being pulled from the rubble.  The players have friends and family as well that were victims of this tragedy, and they need time to recoup as well.  Also, the players safety is a concern.  These are all very valid points of which nobody can argue.  <br>
<br>
The other side to play has fewer reasons, but are valid as well.  Many politicians seem to back playing this weekend, they say it would bring back a sense of normalcy to the country.  They state that life should go on in our country, and that not playing or continuing with our normal routines of life would be giving in to the terrorists.  Many feel football would bring a boost to the somber state our country is in, and would help us move on.  Others also feel it would be a chance to get away from all the images of horror and castastrophe we see in the newspapers and television everyday.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure alot of you believe this issue is trivial, and it is next to what occured.  It nonetheless is an issue of whats appropriate, and what isnt, its different for everybody based on the perspective you take.  At some point we're going to have to move on, and i guess the big question is when is it appropriate to do so?  Personally, i dont know.  I think both sides have valid arguements, and i tend to side towards not playing just because of the players having friends and family that were killed.  Although, i do see the other side, at some point a sense of normalcy has to be brought back.  Football representing America's sport of our generation would be a good symbolization of our country not feeling the effects of 'terror' that terrorism brings.<br>
<br>
You can flame me for posting this since i know emotions are really high right now.  Obviously if you dont think this post is appropriate then you dont have to respond, but if you need to vent on me your more than welcome.  Regardless, i'm curious as to what your opinion on this is.  Everybody has a different idea of what is and isnt appropriate, and how long we should wait before it is appropriate for our 'normal' lives to continue.  I understand people are still terrified right now, and dont feel safe outside, much less a sporting event.  These are all things to consider. <br>
<br>
Some other notes you might want to consider is college football cancelled all of their games thursday and saturday i believe.  Major league baseball has cancelled their games tentatively til friday, and i think they are waiting on the NFL's decision which is supposed to come down today.  The football commissioner is supposedly going to consult the President on this, and ultimately i think President Bush will make the determination.  <br>
<br>

   I'm on the side of &quot;normalcy&quot;.  The terrorists are just going to get an extra chuckle and high-fives all around from every game that's canceled.  Giving them that for free, on top of all the attention they've gotten thus far, is far more disrespectful than playing the games.  <br>
<br>
   The purpose of terrorism is to terrorize; the defense is not to be terrorized.  If you change in response to terrorists actions, then you encourage further terrorism for further changes.  Continuing with life is not a sign of disrespect to the dead, but it _is_ a message to the terrorists that we won't let them win.  Caving in and starting to cringe from any public appearances is letting them win.<br>

The point is made.  Not only that, but there are national church services that are planned to help with the healing process.  The NFL is trying to plan kick-off times around those televised services.  Kinda makes me sick.<br>

Another note is that some college football games are still going to be played on saturday, and baseball is strongly hinting at resuming play tomorrow.  <br>
<br>
I can relate Lilwolf.  I've been down since tuesday, and the constant images of the catastrophe all over television and the newspapers just adds to the depressed mood.  People i talk to are all down as well, and it seems everybody is just either in a stupor or are angry.  I do feel the nfl did make the right decision, although its hard for me not to second-guess it since it would have been a nice change of pace from all the horrifying images and depressive atmosphere our country is in.  <br>
<br>
I do agree Drew that part of terrorism is instilling terror, and it worked.  I think many people are hesitant to go to any mass public event now, and everybody is paranoid of it happening again.  It definitely has instilled a feeling of 'terror' in many people, and i'm sure some people are suffering from that feeling more than others.  Even though that is what the terrorists wanted, its an understandable psychological effect.  <br>
<br>
If they did go on with the games, it would've felt abit inappropriate though, and i dont believe many people would have showed up.  I wonder if people would be willing to show up even two weeks from now given the fear of terrorism.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/13/01 12:43:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /nod</span><hr size=1> I gave away my tickets to the U of Michgan vs. Western Michigan game for this Saturday.

However, I also felt the final decision should have been based heavily on the opinions of the NFL players. If they did not want to play, I think it was a good idea to cancel the games.

While I'm going to miss watching games this Sunday and Monday, we have experienced a disaster of incredible magnitude.  When history looks back on this week, the lack of an NFL weekend will be nothing but a footnote.  The players, audience, coaches, and commentators can't possibly ignore what has happened and just concentrate on the game.<br>
<br>
The ramifications of this week will last for a long time.  The ramifications of who won the Ravens/Vikings game will not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showPrevMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showNextMessage?topicID=1158.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1158.topic&index=13><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.emailToFriend?topicID=1158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.threadControl?topicID=1158.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1158.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot>General - OT</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
