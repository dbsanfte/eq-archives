valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The Politics of Elves</span><hr size=1> OOC:  I have spend the last three years roleplaying on another server.  It was a great server, and I had a great time there, with wonderful people.  Most of those roleplayers have either moved onto DAOC, back to real life, or are heavy into the end-game and not roleplaying.  There is but one serious roleplaying guild left there, and it is evil-aligned...unfortunately, my favorite class is good-aligned.<br>
<br>
I see there are quiet a few RP guilds here on this server, and so I am seriously considering starting a new character HERE.<br>
<br>
Below, I give you a challenge, perhaps a diversion....do you have time to sit and drink a mug of gnomish java and enjoy a prelude to a story I wish to weave upon Norrath?  Do you have the power of the mightiest weapon, the quill and ink, to play your parts?  If so, I may have found a home on Brell, and perhaps a home in a guild if my story catches your interest, for I only write the prelude and the view of my character....the other views are up to YOU to write.<br>
<br>
So sit down with a mug or an ale, and welcome to the POLITICS OF ELVES<br>
<br>
This first post is quite long, it is the backdrop of a my character and how she fits into Norrath.....and as you will see at the end of this post, once you have the prelude read, you are all invited to do YOUR part in writing this story. Do not rush into reading this, wait until you have the time to enjoy a cup of java and settle into this book that we can all write together.<br>

Chapter One: The Present<br>
<br>
JOURNAL:<br>
<br>
I am the fifth child and only daughter of Safyre Hearthwood, my mother, and Frynn Trueshot, my father. My family stretches out with cousins, aunts and uncles, blood related and married. My eldest brother, Maesyn is the guild master since my father's retirement from the ranger's guild, Champions of Faydark. Ran Sunfire is my cousin as is the prankster of our family, Dill Fireshine, so naturally, I was sent to the guild of rangers to train like my father and brothers before me.<br>
<br>
Other family of note are my jolly aunt and uncle, Uuilanu and Manlawen Hearthwood, owners of the Hearthwood Tavern. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Insert of Miaza Goldsinger<br>
<br>
Twenty-one years in the Past....<br>
<br>
I am a cleric of the Koada'Dal, and midwife to many of the women of Felwithe, and all is not well in the Great House of Nobleheart. So much unrest. The Koada'Dal dictate from our lofty towers to the Baronry's of the Feir'Dal, the earthier of our kind and more at touch with the common folk. <br>
<br>
From these palace walls the Princes cannot see and do not care for the lives that produce their daily comforts, only for what they are rightfully due by birth as High-Elves.<br>
<br>
And it is a birth that destroys this great house. M'lady Niola has given birth to her second lifeless child, another girl. The Prince is livid. Our Lord is the Prince of Paladins, Joren Nobleheart. I feel for his poor wife, for she is not the first Lady Nobleheart in mortal danger, but the third.<br>
<br>
A once young Prince had married his first wife, producing three lifeless daughters. She mysteriously died shortly after the last stillborn infant. The midwife disappeared.<br>
<br>
I became the family midwife to the second Lady Nobleheart, being sent by my brother, Kitool Goldsinger. At the birth of the Lady's first child, a girl, there was much hope, but alas, the child lasted but two weeks and failed to thrive. She bore the Prince's heirs five more times, unheard of for a Koada'Dal, but each daughter lived less time than the one before and after much fighting and verbal abuse from the Prince and leader of our Paladin forces, the second Lady Nobleheart was found dead at the base of the stairs, the bruises and broken neck attributed to her fall. But I knew better.<br>
<br>
Another round of celebration and the Prince Joren marries again. This time to a magician-trained lass, Niola Impholder. She is not the average Koada'Dal. She has dark hair, and bears &quot;the taint of wood-elf&quot; as the Prince calls it, but it is the secret hope this will make her stronger at bearing healthy children, as the Fier'Dal are masters of proliferation.<br>
<br>
Niola bears her first, a girl, that lives amazingly one month. On the eve before the child is to be declared legal Heir to the Nobleheart House, she dies peacefully in her sleep, as though she simply forgot to breathe. A second child is born, the Prince's eleventh child, all accursed girls, and too, quickly dies. In a fit of rage, the Prince of Paladins nearly beats his poor wife to death and storms off to the clerics guild to grab his cousin, Terren Starwatcher, for a night of drinking and wenching. <br>
<br>
And I make my plans... <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Re: Insert of Miaza Goldsinger, Part II, Twenty years in the Past<br>
<br>
It is a year later and m'Lady Niola Impholder-Nobleheart has passed the half-way mark of her pregnancy. I make a bold demand and stand toe-to-toe with the Prince, secretly quaking in my soft boots. But to my surprise, Prince Nobleheart agrees. Let the Lady Niola finish her internment at his private hunting lodge in quiet peace. Healthy air and lack of duties can only help the child within the mother grow stronger. He shrugs and proclaims it done, and so off we take ourselves to where I can complete, Tunare willing, my plan.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~*****~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
From the lodge it is not far to the Tree City of happy, bustily productive Fier'Dal. The Barons oversee all the hunting and growing of food, making our spirits and ales, and our weapons ready for enchanting by our Enchanters at the Palace. The Princes and Princesses of the Koada'Dal do not appreciate the work nor the importance the wood-elf Barons have upon their lives, caring only that they are given what they haughtily believe they are due.<br>
<br>
More importantly to m'Lady's life is one particular Fier'Dal, the pregnant Lady Trueshot, pregnant with her fifth healthy babe, a lusty boy no doubt. The Lady Safyre Heartwood-Trueshot and her husband, Baron Frynn Trueshot are the heads of two powerful families among the Feir'dal. But the timing is right, and so for m'lady's sake....<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*******~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I dreamed last night of the coming deed. If I fail, I surely will die, but then so shall m'lady when the child she carries dies. <br>
<br>
But this is a dream, and all is well in dreams, and here in that comfort my plans unfolded nicely. At the onset of m'lady's labor, I hurridly made a quick social visit to the Lady Trueshot, checking on her pregnancy due to labor in a moon's time. Secretly I slipped belladonna leaves into her tea to start her labor early. May Tunare forgive me.<br>
<br>
Rushing back to m'lady Niola, I helped her give birth to a silent, but breathing daughter, blond curls mashed to her wet skin looking very much like her father with his high cheekbones. I set the lady to sleep after the birthing, and placed the quiet baby girl into my basket and covered her with clean towels. By now the runner had arrived to alert me to the Lady Trueshots labors and that they were ready for me to attend to her birth. A dark hair boy was born, a bit small in his prematurity, but lustily screaming all the same. I keep him from his mother's vision with excuses of cleaning &quot;her&quot; up and once he quieted down, I placed the quiet baby girl in her arms and slipped the boy infant into the basket, covering him with towels. Quickly excusing myself, I left with the prize healthy child and a last look at the little pink girl that was now being cooed over by an unsuspecting father. Soon, I returned to my Lady Niola to place the child within her arms. She knew not where this child came from, but she was greatful of it, and at first sight fell in love with this child as though he were her own.<br>
<br>
As for the Trueshots, they have four healthy boys. When this, no-doubt sickly baby girl dies, it will not shatter their world. Life will move on. And in turn, the House Nobleheart now has an Heir, and all will be at peace. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Chapter Two<br>
<br>
Twenty years after the actions of Miaza, we are back in the Present:<br>
<br>
Wardrym Nobleheart watches the dinner his father holds for all the Princes of Felwithe. Their excesses are vulgar and overwhelming in their haughtery and debauchery. Lightening strikes and heralds the approach of a violent storm outside the palace and his father, Prince Joren, turns to his son, &quot;Go boy, and take your mother's hand. You know how storms send her into one of her sicknesses&quot;. The Princes all snicker at their host's words.<br>
<br>
Wardrym reddens in anger and stalks away to his mother's chambers.<br>
<br>
&quot;How is she, Miaza?&quot;<br>
&quot;She is tired, but well enough. Go on in lad. She has been asking for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young man is dark haired like his mother, shorter than the average high-elf, but broad shouldered non the less. He enters his mother's inner chambers and sits on her bed and gently takes her hand as the storm outside reaches a cresendo.<br>
<br>
She turns and smiles at him. &quot;Such a terrible storm,&quot; she sighs. &quot;Much like the night you came to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes mother, I know, it stormed the night I was born at the hunting lodge&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've never really known where you were born, but it was that very night you came to me. I have loved you as my own child from that horrible, horrible night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym's eyes narrow, &quot;but I am your own child, mother, I am dark haired like you,&quot;<br>
<br>
Lady Niola looks straight at Wardrym through unclear eyes as though looking through him and interrupts, &quot;Nay son, I sufferred greatly that night, birthing yet another of Joren's cursed female babies, born quiet and pink and doomed. Miaza saved my life that night, she took that wretched child away and gave me you, didn't you Miaza?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym turns to see Miaza has silently entered the room, a look of shock upon her face. A mix of emotions quickly pass across her face from fear to guilt, and she quickly looks to her feet, speaking softly, &quot;Prince Joren must never know, m'lord, but 'tis true. Your mother, m'lady Niola would no doubt have died for the birthing of that baby. You were her only hope for life and the only hope for peace within the House of Nobleheart.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nobleheart begins to pace the room, looking to his mother peacefully unaware of his turmoil while she lives in her state of reccurring dementia. He looks to his family's healer, Miaza who has been faithful above all others to his family's house for as long as he can remember, always a staunch protector of his mother.<br>
<br>
A thought and he turns to Miaza, &quot;The girl child, what became of her?&quot;<br>
<br>
Miaza begins her tale of that horrible night, true to the dream she had once had but for two things...in reality, there was a horrible storm...and in reality, the girl child lived.<br>
<br>
&quot;And so you are telling me, Miaza, that this girl child that lives is the true heir to this House of debauchery, and I am but a wood-elf imposter?&quot;<br>
<br>
Quietly, still looking at the toes of her boots, &quot;yes m'lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
Incredulously, he begins to laugh, &quot;And what has become of this girl?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of that I do not know m'lord. No doubt she is happy and surrounded by many brothers&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh no doubt, brothers that would be mine. Is she in a good house at least?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, my lord, her family's house is well thought of among the Feir'dal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Feir'dal...I am a Feir'dal,&quot; Wardrym shakes his head and sighs.<br>
<br>
Miaza looks up to the young Prince pleading, &quot;Please m'lord, do not tell this secret. Your father would not accept this girl as his Heir, and he would kill you for not being his blood-son, he'd kill your mother for the betrayal even though this is all my doing. Please, please m'lord, you MUST keep this secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking thoughtfully, playing with his bottom lip, Wardrym slowly nods his head, &quot;Yes, yes I can see the need to keep this secret.&quot; He makes descision. &quot;I am going to make a trip to the hunting lodge. Don't worry Miaza. I will keep all secrets. But for my own peace of mind, I must find answers to the pile of questions haunting me.&quot;<br>
<br>

Chapter Three<br>
<br>
Journal of Saffryn:<br>
<br>
Master Hearthwood has promised me that upon reaching my 9th Season, I would be allowed to travel to Freeport with one of the Druid accolytes to obtain my firebeetle eye for my Flame-Lick spell. My cousin Drynil, a druid in training, and I have been making excited plans.<br>
<br>
Spells and more spells...I feel all this magical energy within me and I know I am stronger than some of the other students, but CHANNELING it from a ball of emotional energy to a pinpoint of purposeful direction is so HARD. Whenever I see an orc I just want to fillet him with my sword. Master says that is fine for emotional children, but I must learn control and refine my battle skills and start making use of the magic that Tunare saw fit to give us…..I'd still rather fillet the orc.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~***********~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I reached my 9th Season this night. Tomorrow Drynil and I begin our adventure to Freeport.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Have you enough food and water?&quot; asks a tallish blond half-elf.<br>
&quot;Yes mother,&quot; Saffryn replies with a sigh. &quot;You needn't toddle after me mother, I'm a big girl&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A bit tall for your age, but only 20 none the less, and that's very young for an elven young lady&quot; Safyre replies.<br>
<br>
The dark haired Frynn enters his daughter's room and interrupts, &quot;Ladies, ladies. You bicker like, like, well, like mother and daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both Safyre and Saffryn turn to the male intruder, each raising one elegant brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright, alright, I'm leaving. I just wanted to wish you luck my little one.&quot; Frynn replies as he reaches up to kiss his daughter on the forehead, as she is equal his height. &quot;How you got so tall I'll never know, no doubt comes from your mother's mother being human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No doubt from you giving me all sons first and she had to reach their height just to survive the wrestling over toys,&quot; shoots back Safyre playfully. &quot;Now go, we women are busy.&quot;<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~*****~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Chapter Four<br>
<br>
Hunting Lodge <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
After hours of arguing with logics and reason with his father, Wardrym finally strikes upon a chord that makes his father relent. He demands that his father give him the family's hunting lodge, Willowswood, as his own for he shall never find decent women within the palace to wench as long as his father is taking the cream of the crop. Prince Joren stops short, throws his head back in a hearty laugh, and calls for his Counsiliary to bring forth the Deed and Title to the hunting lodge, and promptly signs it over to Wardrym.<br>
~~~~~~***~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Wardrym has spent most of a week helping set Willowswood to rights, its wild beauty hidden in years of dust and neglect. He works side by side with his servants, but that is not strange to them. Even as a boy, they knew Wardrym was not the typical high-elf, always caring about them, defending their children as he would defend his own brothers had he any siblings.<br>
<br>
Once the manor is in order, he keeps himself in the garments of the common folk around them, finding the leggings of the wood-elves more comfortable than the fancy robes his family wears. <br>
<br>
He finds he can travel freely about in Greater Faydark, from the Lodge all the way to Kelethin...no constant bowing and insincere compliments, no constant bending of his ear to secure favor through him to his father. Wardrym finds a freedom he never knew he missed, even enjoying sleeping under the stars and the canopy of age-old trees. <br>
<br>
Miaza had confessed to Wardrym the name of his true family and he has spent much time learning of them. He finds that his blood-father, dark haired like himself, is a much respected Baron and retired head of the ranger guild, that his eldest brother is master there now. He learns of the success of the three other brothers. His birth-mother has fair hair, born the third child to the brother of the Fier'Dal Baron Hearthwood and a human mother. That explains his towering over most the wood-elves he comes across, and then again, why he was shorter than most men in the Felwithe Palace, he muses. But then he had gotten used to his friends calling him &quot;Runt&quot;. <br>
<br>
And then there is the girl. Aye, he thinks to himself, she is much like the Prince, perhaps without the mean-streak, but then again... While watching the girl train from afar, he could not help but catch that extra blow to her opponant's back with the flat side of her sword, AFTER the duel was called over. With a critical eye he imagines her blond hair in a high ponytail, exposing those high cheekbones hidden by layers of that tangled mess. She is equal in height of most the young men she trains in, taller then most the women. Long legged, and a bit clumsly, she unknowingly is the cause of many a chuckle from Wardrym.<br>
<br>
<br>
And more and more the thought crosses the mind of Wardrym...how can I put this aright? <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Chapter Five<br>
<br>
Hugging all their brothers and cousins, and their mothers and fathers at the platform above the lift, Saffryn Trueshot and Drynil Heartwood step onto the lift and wave farewell to their family as it begins to lower to the ground.<br>
<br>
Stepping off at the bottom, they dutifully report to Guard Pineshade. Then they heft their packs to their backs, cracked staff in Drynil's hand, a tarnished sword in the hand of Saffryn; they are ready for adventure. Drynil casts camoflage upon them and then starting with a skip, they begin their run to Butcherblock Mountains.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Chase<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Having come from the Hearthwood tavern after a delightfull and animated discussion with its owners over a late breakfast, Ward, as his new Feir'Dal friends called him, was stunned as he turned onto the platform attached to the lift to see the entire Houses of Trueshot and Hearthwood standing there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now you can't be too cautious Dryn, you keep that camoflauge up all the way to the Butcherblock docks, there are aqua goblins roaming about there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes mother, of course. I'm not a brownie scout, I can handle this,&quot; replies Drynil.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well speaking of brownie scouts,&quot; pipes in Maesyn giving Saffryn a stern look, &quot;Don't be taken unawares...And for Tunare's sake, stick to the paths.<br>
<br>
Giving her father a pleading look, &quot;Da', tell them I'll be fine, I've traveled to Kaladim already once to turn in those belts to into Master Canloe, it's not much farther to the docks&quot;<br>
<br>
As the good-byes linger, Wardrum races for the next lift over and runs a shortcut through the woods to his Lodge. <br>
<br>
Reaching his new home, he leaps over a bramble bush, ducks under a low-hanging branch, and skids into the front hall. Out of breath he yells for Daina, the cook, for water and rations and takes the stairs to his chambers three at a time. Grabbing an empty pack from a hook in his room he stuffs it with a handful of small bottles containing invisibility-potions , a money purse, and then treds down the stairs again like thunder, grabs the supplies from Daina waiting in the hall and kisses her cheek as he flies out the door.<br>
<br>
Running the quick jaunt to the Wizard Spires, he stops dead center, bends over, grabbing his knees gasping for breath. <br>
<br>
A curious old gnomish wizard asks, &quot;Is there anything I can do for you lad?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You haven't seen a tall blond wood-elf pass this way with a little dark druid one have you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean like the ones running this way?&quot; <br>

<br>
I thought the good-byes would never end. It's not like I'm running off to marry a troll...hmm ogres. Maybe Drynil should be sure to keep the camoflauge up after Two-Houses. Rumors say an overly made-up ogress is looking for her errant husband or such. Well, come on feet, let's run.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~*********~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
My trip is cursed. I hate being a good-girl. I stuck to the path. Drynil kept our camo up, and what did it get me? My camo dropped just as I was nearing the Wizzy Spires where some deranged elf hooked on us like a tick. There we were, running along minding our own business and there stands talking to a gnome in a dress one dark haired mad-man with brambles stuck to his leggings and twigs in his hair, panting and sweating like an orc, gasping &quot;Hail&quot;..... the dweeb.<br>
<br>
Too bad he caught his second wind because next thing I know, he's running behind us. Drynil swears she doesn't know him, and I swore to her I don't often talk to crazy-running bushes. So I stopped and she camoed us we and continued on our way. We had thought we had lost him. <br>
<br>
Beautiful Butcherblock opened up into clear blue skies and the greenest of fields. Past goblins we ran, staying true to the path as I promised my Ma, twisting and turning through the dwarvish lands. I remembered the turn at the crossroads, heeded the warning of bandits, and turned the final pass to Kaladim, and what do I see but HIM. Sir Bramblepants. Arms flailing in the air like a Krag chick. And then he dissapears. Didn't look like any camo I'd ever seen. <br>
<br>
We stopped at Kaladim a bit to pretend to admire the huge statue of the dwarf at the entrance. Why did they make a statue of a short man so tall? Bet the Highty-Hauty Elfs would say its a short-man syndrome or something else as fancy. Anyway, was but an excuse to perk up our ears and listen for Bramblepants. Finally, at hearing nothing we couldn't give reason to, we continued on our way.<br>
<br>
At the dock we met a dwarf named Loanr. We didn't have much to say. I'm not a talky person anyway and it was getting late in the day. When the boat finally arrived, We got on with Loanr, a gnome who had joined us named Baldaran, and a dwarvish woman by the name of MissMedic who was to be my saviour later.<br>
<br>
It's not easy to keep your spells up on a rocking boat, and Sir Bramblepants appeared eventually looking a bit green. But he kept his distance at least. A wise choice on his part for near sunset a horrible storm began to toss the Siren's Bane about the sea like a feather in the wind and it was my turn to be more than green. I don't know what Sir Bramblepants was doing, but I was wretching myself inside out. That was when MissMedic came to my rescue. She handed me something she called a &quot;pill&quot;, no doubt a gnomish invention. She said it was an herb that had been dried and crushed and then formed into this perfect tiny pebble shape. It's a wonder I kept it down, but I did, and soon felt better for it. Drynil, of course, stayed at the bar down in the hold.<br>
<br>
Don't know what became of Sir Bramblepants, but I am settling down for the night at an inn called The Jade Tiger where I sit writing now. Drynil is at a party in the bar downstairs.   Maesyn would be blue in the face knowing I'm not camping under stars. He can sleep in the wild natural all he pleases, but this ranger is sleeping in a soft bed, thank you very much. <br>
<br>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Sunday, February 8th, 3178<br>
<br>
We awaken to a bright sunny day in a new city, Freeport. As to be expected, I had hoped it would be more than it is, but then I was warned. The streets are full of dirt, beggars here and there. I rounded a corner near some theater and almost stepped into a pile of dung. Had to be ogre. <br>
<br>
Well, I had a task at hand, bring back a pack full of fire-beetle eyes. We set out of the gate, boldly not even asking about for my soul to be bound here. Gah! The rats! What a filthy place. I was a bit surprised at the wealth flaunted by the orcs here, wearing garishly golden sashes yet carrying no more than a few coppers on them. Okay, so I didn't stick to just a few fire-beetles in my hunt. In fact, I was just picking over the body of the last orc I dropped when out of the corner of my eye, there's Sir Bramblepants flailing behind a cactus. Like no one is going to see those sparks going off. Almost looked like he set it afire before he dissappeared. <br>
<br>
Drynil gave him a dirty look and camoed us as we ran onward to East Commonlands to get out of the dust and dirt...and farther away from well, you know.<br>
<br>
Finally, grass and trees. I almost felt at home until I saw the tall human woman killing all those wolves and bears. Those poor animals. Worse yet, she just left their bodies. I understand killing an animal if there be reason, food, pelt for clothing, but this, this was sheer pleasure in killing innocent animals for fun and leaving the bodies to rot. On the brighter side, I was able to help a poor gnome, Stuta by name, who was being attacked by fire-beetle and skeleton at once. Makes one feel good for helping, it does. But good people here are few are far between. Drynil has been here before, so it was all old news to her. She just stayed near an inn drinking ale after I promised I wouldn't tell her Dah and sunned herself all day.<br>
<br>
I do not like this place.<br>
<br>
Lightened a skeleton of his bastard sword to complete my quest for Master Hearthwood. Got my pack full of fire-beetle eyes to pass out in Kelethin tomorrow, and got my fill of being followed by Sir Bramblepants playing hide-and seek with me.<br>
<br>
Finished with my task, Drynil delivered a sack of mail from Idia back home to Ton Twostring here in the Freeport Bard Guild, we walked out onto the street to see Sir Bramblepants begin his arm swinging again, as Drynil swung her own and promptly gated us home.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure, but I think I heard him say something as we gated. Sounded like &quot;I forgot they could do that.&quot;<br>

Chapter Six:<br>
<br>
Saffryn's Journal - Monday, Feb. 23, 3178<br>
<br>
Upon climbing up the Orc Hill, I saw it aflame in blue fire. Quickly my sword joined in with the fray, not a single wood-elf but myself, but we fought well together none-the-less. I half-elven bard, Ramiie was near my same season in his training, a high-elf finger-wagger named Tellurian, and an incredible high-level, high-elf named Hypnosis. I am in awe of her. <br>
My first vision of her was wearing an enchantment to look as though she were a werewolf, her howls bringing chills to my arms. In dropping her illusion she appeared the palest high-elf I have ever seen, snow-white hair and the most beautiful eyes. Though her face wore the same hautery as most high-elves, as Tellurian did too, I found that in fighting a common foe, they were both concentrated and strong, dropping all ideals of being better than my kind. <br>
<br>
Never once did they short me on any protection spells as I fought with my sword and feeble magic, and Ramiie fought with his scimitar. Nay, in fact, it was hard pressed to convince them to loot the corpses so that whatever gods the orcs believe in could take their bodies away. I found it quite difficult to target my flames at the live ones for all the bodies on the ground.<br>
<br>
The experience I gathered tonight was unmeasurable, and I will be proud to present Master Canlor in Kaladim with my prize of three full bags of belts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Saffryn's Journal - Reflections<br>
<br>
I have had a particulary hard week. Death has come my way many times and I would have met death many more had it not been for my uncle, Gareth Pineshade. Of course, he is Guard Pineshade when he is on duty, but he doesn't hesitate to grace me with a wink from under his helm when he's saving my sorry butt from one too many orcs pounding my backside.<br>
<br>
I had dinner with him and my aunt this week and he had a rather frightening tale to tell. He says that there are many other planets in the universe inhabited by many diverse creatures, many of which die only once and it is forever. While Tunare graces us with returning us to where our soul is bound with a healthy body and discards our old one once we gather our things, there are other gods not as forgiving of our, well, over-stretching of our abilities, shall we say.<br>
<br>
On some worlds, says Uncle Pineshade, the soul is separated forever upon that single death and returns to the place of their god. Still, on other worlds, the soul, he says, rests for a time and then enters a new baby's body to start all over. <br>
<br>
I cannot imagine having to start all over again as a babe. How on Norrath could anyone learn from their lessons like that? I'd forever be making the same mistakes if I could not remember making the one that brought me death. <br>
<br>
On a better note, I have not seen Bramblepants for sometime. There is rumor that he had to suddenly return home, wherever that is. I wonder how he weaseled the deed from the old Prince that once owned that garish lodge. <br>
<br>
I, no doubt, will have nightmares again tonight, on dying once and forever and waking as a helpless infant screaming up into the face of Sir Bramblepants with those ever present twigs in his hair.<br>
<br>

Interludes -<br>
~~~~~*******~~~~~~~<br>
Letter from Miaza:<br>
<br>
My lord, Prince Wardrym,<br>
<br>
Please return home with haste. Your mother is quite ill and I fear there will be no recovery. <br>
<br>
Your servant, Miaza.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~**********~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Proclamation from the Princely Consortium of Felwithe to the Barons of Kelethin:<br>
<br>
Due to increased costs in housing, supplying, and training our warriors and casters against the building of the Orcish foes, there shall be an increase in the tithing of Baronry profits of an additional 12%.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~*********~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
<br>
Posting within the City of Kelethin<br>
<br>
Here ye all Baronrys:<br>
A meeting shall be held this Saturday Eve at sunset in regard to the latest proclamation sent down from the Princes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Funerals and Designs<br>
~~~~~~~~**********~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Prince Wardrym stands deep in thought, staring at the last of the glowing ashes that had been his mother's funeral pyre. His father has long left to attend an irreverant celebration with the other Princes. Turning slowly, his thoughts turn to plans, and he eventually ascends the steps to his father's home. He doesn't have to go near his father's reception room to hear the loud boasting and bravado. <br>
<br>
Glasses are clinked loudly at the salute to successfully convincing the King to raise the taxes upon the wood-elf Barons. Cheers have been celebrated everyday as the Princes raise their ideals of &quot;custom of living&quot; and increase their heaps of profits. &quot;Will the celebrations ever end? Will the burden upon the Barons ever break their backs,&quot; Wardrym mumbles to himself.<br>
<br>
Wardrym arms himself with tomes of ancient law books, and prepares to journey home to Willowswood Manor.. knowing full well he is about to let loose a demon, and secretly smiles to himself. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Council of Barons<br>
~~~~~~~*********~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Smoke curled from a rosewood pipe in a slender serpentine thread up to a small storm that was gathering above the heads of the Barons; and though the scent of the Hearthwood Tavern, with its pipes and ales and gathered kin was pleasant, the mood was tense. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's got to STOP!&quot; yelled Baron Ashwood, pounding a fist on the bar. &quot;We all know very well the raise in taxes is to line the Princes' pockets. We've all been into Crushbone, and if anything, their forces are weakening.&quot;<br>
<br>
Baron Trueheart taps his rosewood pipe into the ashtray and quietly replies, &quot;True enough, Learle, but everytime we stand against the Princes, they throw the Book of Laws at us. It's not this single act that is the trouble, tis the Book of Law itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking around the room, Baron Webdancer and Baroness Windlehands of the Bards' Guild are nodding their heads in agreement, as well as Barons Tylfon and Expin of the Scouts.<br>
<br>
Baroness Kweili of the Gem Merchants stands, &quot;But what are we to do of it? The Book of Law has been in place since it was handed down by Tunare to our ancesters when we left Antonica for this land we hold now.&quot; <br>
<br>
Kweili sits as Baron Tilluen stands, also a Merchant Baron, &quot;And so how do we go against the Book of Law and the will of Tunare?&quot;<br>
<br>
Baron Regren takes his turn and answers, &quot;Is it Tunare's will for the so-called High Elves to hold to the letter of the law when the letter is of an ancient alphabet and Tunare's children have matured beyond its intent?&quot;<br>
<br>
Saffryn sits quietly, observing from her corner, smirking at the fletching merchant, Lord Lanin. &quot;He's found a solution to the raise in taxes, the crook,&quot; thinks Saffy, &quot;he's raised his prices much higher than the fletcher in the the shop near him. Beware the unwary.&quot;<br>
<br>
Baron Regen takes the attention of the floor again, &quot;Then the problem to solve is how do we break the Book of Law. The Princes hide behind the ancient rules to maintain their way of life. They will not let go of it easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
The argument continues long into the night. <br>
<br>
~~~~***~~~~<br>
OOC: though I cannot tell you what will happen next as that will depend on interaction with people in game and on how you all choose to write your parts, I CAN say that when I reach 20th season, I will NOT be trying to take the famous names of Trueshot or Hearthwood, but the couple will take the name for the hunting lodge...Willows or Willowswood. <br>
<br>
I, an amateur writer, submit to to you an invitation to help me build on my story (for entertainment purposes only) and perhaps weave it with any ongoing concuring stories in your guilds.<br>
<br>
~~~~***~~~~<br>
As we return to our story.....<br>
<br>
At the current time, the wood elves, and any of YOU wood elves interested, are in the Hearthwood Tavern at the meeting. Make yourself related to whomever you please that fits into your own characters storylines and that of the guild. Remember, elves are prolific and anyone could be related to anyone that fits into character developement....npc or pc.<br>
<br>
Any of you high-elves, may wish to have a meeting of your own at a Felwithe tavern or what-not. The goal is to weave a conflict, deal with the conflict, and in the end, find peace within the entire realm of elves so that we may be united to battle the evil that blossoms across Norrath. <br>
~~~~~~*********~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The Politics of Elves<br>
Part Two<br>
<br>
Saffryn has but three addictions...tree-tar gum, sunflower seeds, and java. She nods her head at the bar-maid for a refill on the third, wishing the meeting wasn't such a serious one or she'd order a shot of liquor to spike it with. <br>
<br>
Breathing deep the rich aroma, sighing in deep satisfaction at the nutty flavor, she then turns her attention back to the discussion at her aunt and uncle's tavern. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
OOC okay, lets create !!<br>

I gotta come up with what the Book of Law really is and what Wardrym can do with it to turn the tables on the high-elves,  maybe he could have a &quot;friend&quot; show up at Willowswood and help him plot.  And then there's the wood-elves who want to break the Book of Law as well.  <br>

&quot;Sun, love...something is always up with the elves.  The Princes are repressing the Barons, I read the notice that was posted in the inn we stayed at last night.  But we don't have time to figure it out.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The two Humans always felt out of place when they visited Kelethin.  Standing so much taller than the natives, they felt big and clumsy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's just get our provisions and get out of here...before a civil war starts or something&quot; The young Monk said to his wife.<br>

&quot;Ok, love.  Do I sing, or do we try to find that damnable lift?&quot;  Smiled the bard.<br>

<br>
Since we've never met, but my husband and I have spent time lost in Kelethin, I thought perhaps I would give you two characters to work with.  Who knows....we may meet....<br>

Shoshannah and Sunshu have their own on-going story.  And they are well on their way to find Shoshannah's destiny....<br>

I have a hard time writing a story myself.  Well, at least one that doesn't look like I hired a 6thgrader to do it for me.  I'm quite certain that's what you meant when you said your RP was sub-par.<br>
<br>
If you did indeed mean to say that your RP was sub-par, then I have this to say to you.  RP is something that is learned an improved upon.  Like most things, it is only through practice that you can get better.  Most of us &quot;hard-core&quot; RPers are very forgiving when it comes to others.  Nobody cares how good you are, we enjoy that you are giving the effort.  <br>
<br>
So, go ahead and post.  We all enjoy the stories of others.

Okay, so I'm older than most players and I've had years writing, some of the BEST interaction I've gotten over the last three years playing EQ  came from a 15 year old and a 17 year old that were just STARTING to learn what an imagination is.

<br>
He reads the prelude, telling the history of his people, wood-elf and high-elf alike, of the great Empire of Takish-Hiz and the beauty of the Elddar Forest that once covered all the south-western area of Tunaria, the continent now known as Antonica.  <br>
<br>
He reads of the curse of Solusek Ro, bringing drought for an entire year, the rivers running dry, the forest turning to sand, and the exile of the Elves into Faydwer in what has become known as the Lost Age.  <br>

Old Takish held all the north-east of what is now called Antonica, yes?&quot;, Daina begins.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We had two main families of elves, though we all looked much alike, and we all learned whatever profession we cared to learn. We were separated only by the name of our ancestral house,s whether we were of the House of Koad'dal, or the House of Feir'dal.&quot;<br>
<br>
First the House of Fier'Dal who lived in the forests gradually started crowding into the city, the waters dried, the food shortages began starving us out...we could not continue to exist, nor could we take lands from those already established.  Tunare said it would be wrong of us, that there was a gentler way.  Finally, our Goddess and Protector told the clerics that through them, she would lead us to a new world, but once we got there, we would have to be organized quickly to survive, there would be little room for mistakes to set up our home, for though there was space enough for all of us in the New World, there were others that would covet it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daina wets her throat with the tea, then looks deep into the cream swirling there in her cup as she continues, &quot;Tunare handed down a directive to the Clerics, a Tome of instructions that, if followed to the letter, would save us.  Great boats were built to carry us, along with seeds of all kinds, plants to start anew, and animals for stock and breeding in the new world.  The preparations were made, and Tunare had handed down her instructions. She wanted us to &quot;specialize&quot;, not wasting resources in duplication, we would each be productive in what we do best.  No longer were the elves allowed to learn what struck their fancy.    The Fier'Dal were to no longer study arcane magics, as they were so intuned with nature, where the Koada'Dal were out of step with the cycles of nature, but were stronger in the ethereal elements.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The boat trip was uneventful, though many were sick, unused to sea-travel, but once set upon the dry lands again, the trackers set forth ahead and blazed their way forward, warriors set to guard the perimeters of our large band of people, druids and clerics ready to heal, magical casters protected in the center ready to strengthen us. Immediately upon striking our claim upon the New World, we were to set those Fier'Dal to work building their tree houses and setting up perimeters of safety.  Koada-Dal no longer were to train as warriors save for those with some clerical ability to serve as Tunare's Holy Paladins.  Most were set to use their strength in magic to enchant magical weapons, to pray and heal, to stir up the ethereal to protect, while those woodies tracked, and built and worked with their hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Once the food was set to growth with the aid of the druids to set the plants healthy and strong, and the animals were set to the cycle of life in mating and birthing and growning anew, all elves were turned to set up the stronghold where the ethereal would be protected, the castle of Felwithe.  The Woodies, again, worked with their hands and practical magics, while those who studied High-Magic, those who would later be called the High-Elves, used their magics to move heavy blocks and magically seal outer walls and such.  They even magically protected their water source, that it would never dry up again, that the fish would be plentiful, that Tunare's people would ever be at home in their new land&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And so, that has how it has been ever since. Those who had the strength of the land and practical magics lived with the land, and bred more of those strengths, druids, rangers, warriors, and bards. They began to carry a darker hue to their skin, a woodier color.  Those that specialized in the High-magics, the ethereal, became known as the High-Elves and grew paler in color living away from nature.  The drift between the two becoming wider and wider.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Since that time, the wood-elves have provided for all the elves, wood and high elven alike, with the rewards and fruits of the land.  High-elves have provided the intelligence and protection that high-magics and enchantments can provide. So set forth by Tunare, so is the Book of Law.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finishing her story, Dainia looks up to see Wardrym deep in thought.<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~*************~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Willowswood, Part Two: The Book of Law<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Part Two:<br>
<br>
Wardrym takes in Daina's account of the Exodus as passed down from generation to generation with what he has read of his copy of the Book of Law and looks at her thoughtfully...<br>
<br>
&quot;After the Exodus, the Koad'Dal and the Fier'Dal recorded this history and the tenet of the Mother Tunare on what our trade roles and professions were to be in order to settle quickly and survive in the New World, but what do the Feir'dal know of the political structure of our people as laid down by the Book of Law?&quot; he asks Daina. <br>
<br>
Daina looks up from her chair and places her tea-cup on the side-table and consider's her reply. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The Quest for Windam's Necklace<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Saffryn looked back to the adventure two days ago, running through Butchblock to meet the Dragons in the ancient druid circle there....adventure for her, as she was attacked by bandits on the way, and was traversing an area of Butcherblock that she'd not ventured into before. But challenge is the way of the ranger and that is why she chose the path that her family before her had also chosen. <br>
<br>
There in the circle, she met Windam, Minz, Aegeras and Legadas and was set about her first quest to prove herself worthy to be an Elder Dragon. The quest....Finding Windam's lost necklace. &quot;I was told to find Xareth, that this Xareth had it, but who could this person or beast be,&quot; she thinks to herself. <br>
<br>
Saffryn had set quickly about to find more information, first visiting the sages at the Conclave of Everlore, then the Spires of Alhakazam. Even the learned in the Caster's Realm had no information on beast nor man named Xareth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Entering the Guild Hall and finding it empty, she serves herself an ale sits near a fire waiting for others to come in so she can introduce herself to the others, and perhaps pick their brains for information that will help her on her quest. <br>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
&lt;Greimyst bows before Saffryn&gt;<br>
<br>
I believe the knowledge you seek can be found here:<br>
<br>
pub43.ezboard.com/ftheord...=150.topic <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Saffryn's reply:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Saffryn nods as she takes the scroll from Greimyst that tells of the account of Windam's necklace and sits to read the tale.<br>
<br>
Looking up at the Vah Shir, she asks, &quot;Is there a picture of the necklace? If we had a picture of it, or perhaps a portrait of someone wearing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stands and walks to the hearth, rubbing her chin between her fingers, thinking aloud, &quot;If I can convince this Xareth to at least let me make a sketch of it, returning the necklace may not be as important as finding the clues to Windam's past within what the necklace looks like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder if this Xareth is even wanting this necklace now, it must have cured his curse by now. I wonder why a clue to Windam's family would be connected to a curse that would turn a Teir'Dal to a Koad'Dal.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, must he always wear this necklace to prevent the turning to a high elf or was it needed as a means to turn the curse, do we know if he must continually wear it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Saffryn turns and looks intently at the Vah Shir. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
In the Library of Willowswood:<br>
<br>
Daina hesitates, &quot;well, not too many of us have an actual copy of the Book of Law, and certainly not many Feir'dal have ever seen one. I do, however, remember reading a copy of a copy as a child. After the story of exodus were a lot of very boring laws. It, of course, stated that the Feir'dal, in charge of land and nature, would be the Barons over that land, and each Feir'Dal family House would be set as a Baronry. From this we were to provide for the people. The High-Elves, being born and bred for higher magics, were instilled with higher knowledge and therefore, in charge of politics, you know, getting along with the races around us, deciding who we would be a peace with, and when we would be at war and with who. Not that any of the wood-elves wanted anything to do with all those high-lofty ideas. And so, the Koad'Dal became the Princes and we were ruled as such.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says Wardrym thoughtfull, &quot;yes.....and there are many copies about to read of the Book of Law.&quot; Ward looks up with a thought. &quot;Has anyone read the original, seen the original?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well no, sir, of course not,&quot; replies Daina. &quot;I'm rightly suprised you don't know that or why, you being a high-elf yourself, me lord. It's protected up in that castle or your people with some wizard spell or what-not&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well of course, really. Land sakes, Master Wardrym, where have you been the last ten years? You have your head in the sand like a Ro Croc?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; grins Wardrym at his beloved housekeeper, &quot;but I have been ignoring certain truths rather than face them, and some rather startling truths have come to light recently to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym walks away to gaze out the picture window staring at the grand old willow tree that gives the manor its name, &quot;It's far past time I set to righting the wrongs, of my family, and for our race.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking confused, Daina stands and shakes her head, &quot;Well sir, I be glad I'm just a woodie, and I'm far past time getting these dishes washed and back in their cupboard. I'll check in on ya by supper, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right, Daina,&quot; he answers absent-mindedly. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Back at the guildhall of OED:Re: The Quest for Windam's Necklace:<br>
<br>
Windam:<br>
<br>
Windam pauses and thinks for a moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saffy, my poor dear. My necklace shouldn't be of your concern at all. Xareth is a tricky man to deal with and you shouldn't have to be caught up in the midst of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My past well... The necklace once belonged to my mother whom died many many years ago, then belonged to my elder sister Windiiani, whom Xareth killed a spell ago. Though I miss it dearly, it was only a material possesion of mine.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I hear he only needs it as for curing the curse, not wearing it full time, or so I've heard. I could always be wrong though. I know little of it other than the fact that Xareth needed it for the cure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As for my family well... I don't know why or how it links to the curse, because I myself have never run across it before. So that is beyond me I'm afraid. <br>
<br>
Please Saffy, if you do find yourself in need of aid, do not hessitate to call on me.&quot; she finishes as she bows slightly. <br>
-------<br>
<br>
Shaede:<br>
Shaede, listening in on all who have gathered in the main room of the guild hall speaks her mind, &quot;High brow? Ascrida you should count yourself lucky if I ever allow you to draw breath again. And Minz...I thought you liked members of your guild.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I will make you a deal then Saf. You convice Kassy and anyone else involved in this debaucle to hand over the notes that my beloved needs then I will hand deliver you the necklace. If not. I would find a new guild that does not send you to your death.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns and walks away the creature of air following behind her blowing papers around.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Saffryn: <br>
<br>
Turning to Shaeda, Saffryn stops Shaeda's exit with a question, &quot;Tell me, m'lady, what papers do you speak of? Perhaps we can find a compromise that serves us both. I do not deal lightly with Teir'Dal that insist on following the cursed path of Innoruuk, however, if it be in the aid of one of my own, I will consent to perhaps assisting you in what you seek, IF, and I do mean IF...this will aid Windam and not do us any harm by it. Tell me, what are these papers.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Shaede Wavecaller:<br>
<br>
Shaede narrows her eyes. &quot;You tread _dangerous_ waters child. We are the Chosen of Innoruuk and it is ONLY because of our decree of 'Hate with Honor' that I am here making this offer to you. My Chosen gave his word to return the necklace after his work with it is done. The necklace would be in your hands now, if the lightblind you associate with held the same honor as we. Kassy Na'Verdis was set with the task of translating some book needed to reverse this processes. She now is lacking these pages. I am sure between you and this den of honorless dogs you can find them. If so, then you will not need to deal with us further except on the field of battle when the Harvest comes to cull Norrath for the Prince of Hate. Do not underestimate me or my people. Now move, else you will not live to see the dawn.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
-------<br>
Saffryn : <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, then the first step to my quest is to find these missing pages. Anything you know of this book and what pages I am looking for will help,&quot; the ranger replies.<br>
<br>
&quot;A temporary, er, understanding then. After all, good and evil are relative to the one doing the judging, and I do not judge Teir'dal by the color of their skin but by their deeds.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Though I believe you trust in an untrue god, I am not here to judge that. You have a man who is cursed and you wish him cured. Whether you call it &quot;love&quot; or &quot;chosen&quot;, you stand by him, and I can respect that. I have a task to secure a necklace, and you offer to return that necklace if I find the pages. Do not believe me foolish in trusting you....I do not trust that easily, however, I shall give you a certain...space...in which we may temporarily be a peace until our mutual task is completed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You and I, Shaede, will find those pages, heal your man, and return a family heirloom....after that....we shall dissolve our peace and return to our battles....Deal?&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
On the jog from Willowswood to Felwithe, Ward thinks on what he has learned and realizes that the only way to straighten out this mess is to start from the beginning, which means taking a good look at the original Book of Law. So far all he's seen are copies, and everyone he has talked to has also only seen copies. So, with that, he has decided to take up his study at the Castle and get a look at the original.<br>
<br>
Checking in at his father's home and dropping off a bag in his old room, Wardrym heads straight for the Paladin's guild to speak with an old friend.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seleni! How are you m'lady,&quot; Wardrym smiles winningly at Seleni Treekeeper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Wardrym Nobleheart, you've been away too long to start flirting at me with that smile of yours, what do you want.&quot; she replies with an air of suspicion at her old sparinng partner. &quot;You certainly aren't back to practice your riposte.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ward looks down at his toes guiltily, &quot;No, no, I'm not.&quot; he answers, then looking straight at her, &quot;I need your help, Seleni. It should be a simple matter. All I want is to look at the Book of Law, THE Book of Law. Problem is that I don't know where it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You mean you father never told you? You being the heir of the Star of Felwithe?&quot; she looks incrediously at him.<br>
<br>
Trying not to look stupid he answers, &quot;Well, um, actually.....what is the Star of Felwithe&quot;.<br>
<br>
Chuckling at her old paladin classmate, Seleni pats him on the back, &quot;Come Wardrym, let's have a bit of wine and cheese and I'll fill you in on what that drunken father of yours has neglected to tell the next Prince of Paladins.&quot;<br>
<br>
They walk from the Paladin's guild and find a quiet corner booth where they can talk freely. After ordering a bottle of elven wine and a chunk of halvarti and a small loaf of sour bread, they resume their conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, Wardrym, you know of the Book of Law, that if was written and carried here all the way from Old Tunaria, yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, and I know the story of the Exodus, and the rules that followed, all have seen a copy of it. What I want is to see the original.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, m'lord heir of Nobleheart, the original is locked away in the High Keep of Felwithe, protected by Wizard Lock, a spell cast by the direct ancestor of Tarker Blazetoss, the Master of the wizard guild now. The heads of each guild upon landing here in the New Land, Faydwer, not trusting each other, demanded that the lock-spell include a member of each of their guilds as a key. The warrior's cared not for such things that included magic and excluded themselves. That left five guild leaders, five points to a Star Council...Wizard, Mage, Enchanters, Paladins and Clerics.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah....the Star COUNCIL, I know of the Star Council, but know nothing of their involvement with the Book of Law, only that they hold the most weight in Parliment,&quot; offers Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Ward darling, now don't interrupt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where was I , oh yes. The legend says it was a dark and stormy night when the deed was done. Personally, I think that was just for effect to scare small children,&quot; Seleni says wryly. &quot;Whatever the weather, the Star Council, or the Star of Felwithe as it was called then , all five of them, met at the highest tower of Felwithe High-Keep. There they entered a room where upon the floor was and is tiled with a great five-pointed star. Each guild leader stood at a point of that star and the Book of Law rested upon a pedestal in the very center of the star. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No one knows what spell was used, what components were needed, what words were spoken. Nevertheless, the outcome is for sure....no one can go near that book unless they are a direct descendent and heir of that Star Council. One can enter the room if they've permission or special clearance, but to step upon any part of that star means instant evaporation of your body fluids. A little messy in my opinion, but it was a MAN afterall that created the spell. Just a pile of bone and dried up sinew is all that's left.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't suppose &quot;Wow&quot; would be a very princely word right now,&quot; says Ward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow indeed.&quot; replies Seleni.<br>
<br>
&quot;One more question, Seleni and then I'm going to take you out for a night of dancing. Who are the members of the Star Council now?&quot;<br>
<br>
The tall red-head slaps Wardrym hard on the arm with her fan, &quot;Why Wardrym Nobleheart, your own father is ON that Star Council, you are HEIR to that council and are to replace him at his death, and you know NOTHING of our politics, who your oppononts will be...&quot; she replies aghast, mouth open in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Shaking her head she contines, &quot;Well keep this in your head Lord Nobleheart, next Prince of Paladins, those who will oppose you in council are as follows: Yeolarn Bronzeleaf and his daughter of the Clerics; Tarker Blazetoss and his daughter, Serri Moonwatcher (of whom you used to date, you goose) of the Wizards; your mother's cousin Reff Truewood and his son representing the Mages; and Kinool Goldsinger and his son of the Enchanters.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grinning as handsomely as he can, Ward takes up the hand of his friend as he slides out of the booth, kisses her hand, saying out loud, &quot;And where shall we dance the night away, my beautiful lady,&quot;......... while inside he is thinking &quot;Well I'm not the true heir.....so now what do I do?...... Shall I convince one of the real heirs to help me get to that book and give away that I'm not really the child of Prince Nobleheart, or do I trick his secret daughter into helping me get to that book.&quot;<br>
<br>
He chuckles at a picture in his head of Saffryn Trueshot glaring at him when he asks her to help him.... a chuckle that Seleni assumes is for her as they go off into the night together.<br>
<br>

<br>
--------------<br>
Seeing movement outside the hall, Saffryn decides not to wait for an answer and steps out the main doors to the building. Seeing a stranger standing near a tree across from her, she takes a guess and hails him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail and well met, Xareth. I wish a word with you. I have spoken with your woman about your, er, condition...and a possible solution.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She is not my woman...not a possession. We chose to stand beside one another, and just how do YOU think you can help ME?&quot; he replies.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have made a deal with Shaede. I will find the missing pages to the spell needed to turn you back to your former self, and she will hand over Windam's necklace.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And what if once the spell is done, I decide not to turn over the necklace?&quot; Xareth asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good question, all right then...I shall provide you with the pages in a place where you shall perform the spell surrounded by Dragons. If once the spell is completed, you do not turn over the necklace...the Dragons shall pummel you,&quot; answers Saffryn.<br>
<br>
Xareth throws his head back and laughs, &quot;And why should I want to do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Makes no difference to me, inkie. If you don't want the pages to the spell, I'll move on to another quest. YOU, however, will spend your days a Pale Lily,&quot; Saffryn retorts with a pirate smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;You aren't the typical do-gooder, are you, a bit of a mercenary,&quot; says Xareth with a raised brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mercenary? I look after meself. It's not like I looked for a guild-home of saints, after all...our guild leader IS a rogue.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An assasin, no less,&quot; chuckles Xareth. &quot;Alright then. You get those pages and we shall see where we go from there&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be seeing you then, Pale Lily,&quot; finishes Saffryn with a nod and two-fingered salute as she pushes herself from the wall of the building she had been lazily leaning against.<br>
<br>
And with that, Xareth disapears into the woods. <br>

<br>
It had been a very eventful couple of weeks months for Saffryn, between reaching her 9th Season with her excursion to Freeport for the firebeetle eyes to the recent encounters at the guildhall and accepting the quest for Windam's necklace.  <br>
<br>
Saffryn decides it's time to get beyond her 11th Season and earn the right to learn Meditation and decides to set forth inth Crushbone.  Having acquired a shackle key, she starts sneaking towards the back of the Orc Hold to where the slaves are being kept when she is suddenly struck down by two slavers.  Realizing her stupidity at letting her guard down, she must further chastize herself when she realizes she still had her soul bound in Freeport.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid, stupid, stupid !&quot; she exclaims within the guild hive-thought.  Aegeras answers her with a worried, &quot;You okay, Saffryn?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, yes, just bearing the consequences of my own stupidity.  I just let myself get cornered by two Orc Slavers in Crushbone and I left myself soul-bound in Freeport.  Just heading for the boat back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't.  Don't get on the boat, I'll port you back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not wanting to put the kind man out and take him away from his own training, &quot;No, No, Aegplant, er, Aegeras, m'lord.  This is my fault..I was stupid.  I can take the boat, it'll teach me a lesson.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I insist, and I am no lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I'm sorry, you've told me that before.  It's a habit you know, Sir Aeggo, er, Aegcentric, um, Aegeras.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not a sir either.  Meet me in East Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you insist, on my way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Running to not keep the man waiting, she runs right past him and he spins her around.  &quot;Now join me, Saff,&quot; he says, and with that he opens a portal and takes her hand and together they step in and are whisked away to the rings of Steamfront.<br>
<br>
From there they run together through Lesser Faydark when she is spoken to in the elven mind by a young one who has just obtained his Ressurection spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take the Res, Saff, I'll meet you at Crushbone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not knowing why Aegaras has not returned to his own training, she welcomes his aid as he watchers her back while she re-memorizes her spells, dons her gear from her corpse* (how this is explained is in Willowswood Part One) and smiles from ear to ear at Aegaras.  &quot;I can't thank you enough, Aegnoodle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's nothing, lets see what's going on at the Trainer&quot; he says.  Quickly he protects her with an onslaught of spells as she takes the trainer down, an Orc that would normally be much too difficult for her.  On her first assault on the Trainer, she is rewarded with the Shiny Brass Shield. She squeels in delight and hugs Aeg tightly about the neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're family now, Saff, it's nothing.&quot; grins Aegaras.  &quot;Lets get you the Emporer&quot; he adds, you could use some chainmail.&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Saffryn can move, open mouthed and hiding her quaking knees, Aegaras is back with the Emporer at the mouth of the Crushbone cave.  &quot;Take him Saffryn,&quot; Aegaras cheers, keeping her protected and asking others to back away and let Saffryn have the fight alone.  Weak from just taking the Trainer, Aegaras has to help Saffryn finish him off and the Emperor has empty pockets.  They both rest and rebuild their strength and mana before running to the wall just outside the bridge to the castle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait here, Saffryn,&quot; says Aeg, and she obeys, goosebumps tingling up her spine and hardening her nipples thinking of the swordplay she is about to engage in. Straight away Aegeras is back, Saffryn is fully loaded with protection buffs from Aegaras.  The sword play begins.  She dodges many blows, wears the Emperor down with the Thistle coat cast upon her by Aeg, and slashes and kicks her way with the Strength of Earth and Skin of Steel until the Emporor turns his back to run.  Firmly planted into the ground with a casting of snare, the Emperor is trapped, and with the final blow, Saffryn peels away the magical dwarven ringmail tunic.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aegquiche, I have earned my twelfth season this day, a much sought after shield, and a beautiful coat of ringmail, all because of you,&quot; she tries not to gush.  &quot;How can I ever repay you kindness?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, remember, Saff, it's nothing.  We're Dragons.  We're family.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saffryin sighs, &quot;Well, then I guess at the very least I should stop flubbing up your name...Aegaras.&quot;<br>
<br>
The day at an end, she hugs Aegaras and pounds his back soundly the way she hugs one of her many cousins.  Both grinning at each other, Saffryn flips her sword deftly over her wrist, sweeps the sword with a bow, and then blows a bubble and snaps the tree-tar gum she's chewing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Until next- time, my new cousin.  May Tunare always watch your back, and if not, call me and I shall be there.&quot; <p><center> <img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/theorderofthewhitehand/images/oldsig.jpg"><br><b>Saffryn, Ranger of Norrath<b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaffryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saffryn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f95.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/28/02 9:34:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaffryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saffryn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f95.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/1/02 12:24:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=531.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.elchtom.de/Fantasy/f75.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Politics of Elves</span><hr size=1> The Meeting:<br>
<br>
Saffryn is sharing cornered with her aunt and uncle Hearthwood at their tavern recounting the exciting day she had hunting with Aegeras when in walks &quot;Mr. Bramblepants&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah Gah, there he is again, everywhere I go,&quot; Saffy says to her aunt and uncle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who, Wardrym? He's a nice fellow, let me introduce you,&quot; says her uncle, Manlawen, as he motions for Wardrym to come over as Saffryn cringes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Wardrym Nobleheart, I'd like you to meet my niece, Saffryn Trueshot.  Saffy, this is Ward,&quot; says Manlawen.<br>
<br>
As Ward bows to Saffy she quips &quot;Nobleheart, not Nobleheart of the Felwithe Paladin's guild?  You dunna look like any hauty, er high-elf to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Saffy!  Ya need nah be rude!&quot; says her aunt, Uuilanu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, yur lordship, but the Koada'Dal have nah been very well thought of as late with the rise in taxes and all,&quot; exclaims Saffy with a raised brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's alright m'lady, I completely understand.  I am in disagreement with workings of Felwithe, myself.  As for my looks, well, I find the clothing and the lifestyle of the Feir'Dal to be much more comfortable and practical...and I do not cling to any titles so please, no &quot;lordship&quot; here.<br>
<br>
With a look and a grin to each other, Saffryn's aunt and uncle move back to take care of other customers coming into the tavern and leave the two to get to know each other.  Watching them go, Ward purses his lips together and decides to plunge in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, now that we've met, m'lady&quot; begins Ward and is interrupted by Saffryn, &quot;No m'lady's here either.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right then,&quot; Ward continues, &quot;Saffryn.  I've been looking for you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Following me, ya mean,&quot; as she takes a drag from her ale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well yes, I had to see if you had the qualities I'm looking for.  I need your help.&quot; says Ward.<br>
<br>
&quot;My help?  What would a Lord of Nobleheart need with a lowly woodie like me?&quot; smarts off Saffy.  Then remembering her manners, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This must be strictly confidential, on your word as a Feir'Dal,&quot; says Ward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well if you hold the word of a Feir'Dal to any value, yes, I give you my word.  What is this help you need.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a deep breath, he looks Saffy in the eye and says, &quot;I think the Book of Law has been corrupted.  It's quite obvious that the Koada'Dal use it to their full advantage over the Baronrys, but I think that they have an extra advantage.  I think they have altered the words that were set forth by our Goddess, Tunare.  I mean to find out the truth of this and set things right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking astonished, &quot;Now why on Norrath would you want to do that?  You're own father would have you gutted from jaw to groin, I'd wager.  What reason would you have to go against your own people for the sake of mine?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because I have a secret of my own that I'm not ready to reveal at this time,&quot; answers Ward.  &quot;I've taken Willowswood as my own and I have no intention of following in my father's footsteps, save that of my paladin training.  He was very cruel to my mother and sent her to an early grave.  The Princes live in an endless cycle of debauchery and celebration in their luck at being born in the lap of Felwithe.   It sickens me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really hate Prince Joren, eh?&quot; says Saff.  &quot;You are in good company.  He lauds his heavy hand over the Emerald Warriors and leaves them to do the dirty work while the Felwithe warriors get the better duties and the Paladins act the officers and rule them all.  So...why do you need me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The original Book of Law was magically written by Tunare, herself and cannot be added to or anything taken away.  It's been hundreds of years since the public has seen the Book.  We all see copies, but only a select few have access to the original.  I mean to have a look at that tome, see what it REALLY says so I can decide from there what to do.&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are the select few who can see the book,&quot; Saff asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only the guild-leaders and their heirs, five leaders and their heirs.&quot; replies Wardrym<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you're the heir, are you not, Prince Joren is the guild-leader of Pally's.&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;My father does not quite trust me.  We haven't been close, ever.  He has showed no intention of training me to follow him as his heir even though I have been publicly and lawfully named as such.  He does not bring me to any of their political functions, and has not given me access to any 'sensitive' matters. &quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you are going to sneak your way in?&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot; replies Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any traps?  Secret Passages?  Magic locks?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes&quot; replies Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then what you need is a rogue from the Scout's guild, not me,&quot; she says as she begins to stand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait!, there's more,&quot; Ward says quickly.<br>
<br>
Sitting she says, &quot;I'm listening.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nervously he continues, &quot;If I'm right about what I've discovered so far, your family is involved.  I need you, a Trueshot to get to the Book,&quot; he lies as Saffryn looks at him unconvinced.<br>
<br>
With a heavy sigh and crossed fingers that she'll accept the false tale he's about to weave, he continues, &quot;The Trueshots weren't always rangers, Saffryn.  There is a book of lineage that came with us from Tunaria.  In it, it shows that before the Houses were divided into Koada'Dal and Feir'dal and specialized, there were Trueshot wizards.  Some of the Trueshots lived in Takish-Hur.  The majority lived in the forest and that's why your family house went with the Fier'dal, but there was one very important Trueshot wizard, the wizard that set the final lock that seals the sacred tome, our Book of Law.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a secret trick to the lock,&quot; Wardrym contines, &quot;that all the of the Koada'Dal heirs learn upon their father or mother's death. I don't know what the secret is that trips the lock without setting off the traps, however, the lock is said to answer to an Heir of the Trueshot wizard without question. I need YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay,&quot; says Saffryn, &quot;let's say I believe this, hypothetically, why me - why not one of my brothers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because your brothers are older and busy with more important conflicts in Norrath than just the Crushbone Orcs,&quot; Ward answers.  &quot;I doubt they'd give me the time of day.  On top of that, with age, everyone in the Baronry's have a love of taking everything to committee and having meetings before deciding on anything.  If I approached one of your brothers, next thing I'd know there would be a meeting of the Baronry's about it and nothing would get done.  You know that. On top of that, it would leak out from there to the Koada'Dal and my plans would be blown.  I'd never get to the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you don't think I'LL take it to commitee?&quot; Saffryn asks wryly.<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot; answers Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you tell anyone about your cousin, Drynil, who was supposed to watch over you on your excursion to Freeport to get those Firebeetle Eyes, that she spent the whole time drinking in the taverns and inns and not protecting you?<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; answers Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can keep a secret, and get the job done.  I've been watching you, you know.&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Following me, yes, I know.&quot; replies Saff <br>
<br>
&quot;You move like a rogue.  You're silent when you aren't popping that tree-tar gum you always have in your mouth.  You track like an aged expert.  You never waste time or movement.  You're sense of direction is uncanny...&quot; <br>
<br>
Saffryn interrupts, &quot;compared to YOU'RE skill at sleuthing, no doubt, but enough of trying to puff up my ego,&quot; she grins as she sees a vision in her head of &quot;Mr. Bramblepants waving his arms wildly behind a cactus in Freeport, trying to hide with a spell.   &quot;What's in it for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sure you aren't a mercenary rogue?&quot; asks Wardrym as he senses he's won her over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mercenary, maybe, rogue,&quot; she reples with a pirate-smile, &quot;nay, just a humble ranger.&quot;<br>
<br>
