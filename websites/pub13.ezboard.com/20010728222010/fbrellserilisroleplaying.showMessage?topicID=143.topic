A stray ray streaked across a young girls sleeping eyes, startling her to consiousness. She awoke with the blurred vision of lazy slumber, and fixing her gaze on a fuzzy humanoid form rapidly approaching her.<br>
<br>
The halberd whipped through the air and struck the ground a few inches from her head, spraying flayed grass and soil onto her golden hair.<br>
&quot;Jerk&quot; she said as she rubbed the dirt from her face. A deep chuckle came from the obnoxious elf who lived to annoy her.<br>
&quot;C'mon, we have lessons. General Jyleel is mad that you are late.. again.&quot; spoke the young elf, shouldering his weapon, and haughtily carrying it off to the waiting group a few hundred meters away.<br>
&quot;General can kiss my white butt! He kept me late last night practising those stupid thrusts,&quot; she said as she gathered herself and ran to catch up.<br>
&quot;Heh, it appears you needed the extra practise after yesterday's performance. Seemed like even the new recruits got the best of you.&quot;<br>
Sporting a scowl that could make an orc whimper, she ran to catch up to the waiting crowd of young paladins.<br>
<br>
Several of the Wood Elves had gathered here, too. They were here only because of thier financially wealthy families had paid thier way into the High Elven Academy of War. The young girl stood within the ranks of the upper echelon, for she had trained with them for about a year now, but still had the skills of a first week recruit. Many times she would slip away to catch a nap, or follow a pixie out into the woods, or on occasion travel to Kelethin - the nearby wood elf city - and gossip with the local innkeeps. Jyleel had been patient with her, as she was the daughter of his best friend, a merchant within Felwithe, but his patience was nearing an end. Today he would put her skills to the test.<br>
<br>
A quick command and the initiates formed into pairs and began sparring with practise manuevers, going slow at first to warm up, then speeding into more skilled weapon play. The young girl, who went by the name of Fenye, chose the longsword and a simple shield as her armament of choice. Most chose the heavier halberd, but being weak of body she could not lift the heavy weapon, and was more suited to using the lighter sword.<br>
The General walked back and forth, surveying each of the cadets' moves, making remarks on performance and offering advice. He spent a great deal of time watching Fenye, and this made her nervous.<br>
&quot;Keep your back straight! Widen your stance! Don't be so aggressive, you are opening yourself up for a counterattack!&quot; he called out, watching each of the young girls' mistakes. Again and again she repeated them, and finally threw down her blade and sword in frustration.<br>
&quot;I can't fight! I'm not a fighter! I'm just a merchants' daughter, and I didn't even WANT to become a paladin!&quot;<br>
she cried out, tears streaking down her face. The General frowned, and watched her storm off in a fit. The rest of the group only paused for a second, then resumed thier practise.<br>
<br>
 <br>
* * * *<br>
<br>
&quot;HAIL EMPEROR CRUSH!! THE CHAMPION OF THE CRUSHBONE ORCS!!&quot; shouted the legions of orcs, who raised thier worn blades and clubs high into the air. Emperor Crush, the largest orc of them all, walked back and forth amongst the mob with a slow, limping gait.<br>
&quot;Tonight! Tonight my orcs, we strike hard! The elves of Faydark will be crushed with our fists! Sliced with our blades! We will grind thier bones and powder out fists with the dust! No elf will be left alive! I order you now, to gather the slaves, lock them up, and prepare for battle! We march at the high moon tonight!&quot;<br>
<br>
The orcs cheered, hitting and biting each other in a battle maddened frenzy, some even were driving so much by the Emperor's speech that they were on the ground, viciously raking the dirt and grass with thier canines. The Clan Crushbone was ready for war.<br>
<br>
<br>
* * * * *<br>
<br>
Fenye lay on her bed, her face buried in her pillow and was soaking it with tears when a small, silent knock at her door lifted her head to attention.<br>
Holding back a sniffle, she spoke in a shaky voice, &quot;come in.&quot;<br>
The small framed, tiny wood elf stepped lightly into the room. It was Werane, Fenye's friend from early childhood. Werane was exceptionally tiny, even for a wood elf. Weighing a merely 65lbs, and standing barely over 4 feet, she looked more like a young human offspring. She had beautfil brown hair, and large, round brown eyes. But the two daggers at her belt's weapon holsters suggested she was not a weak foe. Her leather creaked as she walked over to Fenye's bed, and put a tiny hand on her cheek, wiping a tear away.<br>
&quot;aww Fenye, why do you cry?&quot; questioned the ever so curious elf.<br>
&quot;Damnit, I get so sick of fighting. I don't know why they push me to fight so hard.&quot;<br>
Werane was a bit older than Fenye, but a mere 20 years. And she knew why the Clerics of Tunare sought out Fenye to become a Paladin.<br>
&quot;Do you know why they want you to fight in Tunare's Army?&quot;<br>
&quot;no&quot; sniffled Fenye.<br>
&quot;When you were born, I was so young, and watched your mother bear a miracle that noone has ever seen before. The priests say that you were born not of your father, but of Tunare herself. You look so much like the Mother, and you resemble nothing of your parents. It's in your blood, Fenye. You are Tunare's daughter.&quot;<br>
&quot;That can't be true. I have so little will to fight, and I have no patience to study the arts of clerical magic, much less learn Wizardry.&quot;<br>
&quot;But it is, look at the Mother's Picture,&quot; Werane said as she turned an idol of Tunare to face Fenye,&quot;does it not look like a mirror image? Look at the idol, it looks like she is sad, doesn't it?&quot; It was true, the idol's face pointed downward a little bit, and a small notch of wood made it look like she was frowning, and the grains made it look like tears were coming from it's eyes.<br>
Fenye looked deeply at the idol, and for a moment, she thought the idol looked up at her, and smiled. <br>
&quot;You see? She is sad because you are not following her will. Tunare wants you as her warrior. I'm a mere Scout, but you, Fenye, can become Tunare's champion. Hell, you could even one day become her Avatar for all I know. But I do know this, you have the blood of the Mother flowing through your heart.&quot;<br>
Fenye looked back at the idol, and it was once again frowning. &quot;Werane, you are such a good fri-.. Werane?&quot; The elfen rogue had disappeared, a favorite trick she loved to play with Fenye. Smiling, Fenye spoke, &quot;Sneaky rogue.&quot;<br>
Turning over, and blowing a candle out, the whispers of her friends &quot;your welcome&quot; were heard, and Fenye smiled as she drifted off to sleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
The sounds of screaming and the ringing of steel on steel awoke Fenye abruptly. The flickering of light into her bedroom told her that fires were ablaze, and the acrid smell of smoke stung her eyes and pierced her nostrils.<br>
Coughing, she slammed on the door, but it was boarded. Her attackers had sealed off the doors of every house they set ablaze!<br>
Grabbing an iron fire poker, she beat again and again at the wooden plankes sealing her window, until it gave away enough for her to break free. The bodies of elves and orcs littered the streets of Felwithe, some burning, some bleeding, but all dead or dying.<br>
Scrambling out of the small window, she grabbed a pitchfork from a nearby bale of burning hay, and backed into a corner, petrified from fear and horror. A small orc flew across the tiny space between two houses she was hiding in. The orc landed with a splatter as its' open wounds spilled out across the ground, and a high elf in shining steel ran up to finish the orc off. His sword hummed with a magical nature, singing when he sliced the air with it, and cutting through orcish armor and bone as easily as a guillotine. He stood there, in all is glory, fending off attacker from attacker, seemingly unstoppable.<br>
She noticed a black shape crawling atop a building across the street from her, and she watched as it drew an arrow and notched it into it's bow. Instictively she lunged the pitchfork at it, and the sickening sound of metal piercing flesh and bone told her her aim was true. The fork drove deep into the eyes and skull of the ambushing orc and rolled him backwards off the house. The High Elf, noticing Fenye's desparity, called out to her, &quot;Young one, follow me! We must make sure the sacred Temple of Tunare is not fouled by these stinking scum!&quot; he shouted as he grabbed her wrist and practically drug her to the Temple.<br>
There, many elves armed with long pole arms stood guard, fending off various orcs, and the High Elf threw Fenye inside. The doors were sealed, but just before, she saw a large orc thrust a massive spiked axe through the back of this elf, pushing through his armor and out the front of his chest. The gurgling sound of his voice made her cry.<br>
<br>
Inside, there were the remnants of her cadet squad. Shaking with fear, they huddled together awaiting thier doom. Only two veterans stood with them, and armed to the teeth they were, they showed signs of massive battle fatigue, and one had a bloody bandage wrapped over her neck, where a stray arrow had grazed her earlier.<br>
The sounds of heavy thunder deafened them, as the rains began to kick in. Praises to Tunare rang out, and the fires began to dim. But a new thunder, that coming from the door, was heard.<br>
&quot;The orcs are breaking in!! The orcs are breaking in!! We are all going to die!!&quot; shouted a panicky elf, soiled in his pants and eyes soaked with tears.<br>
Fenye looked around, the place was a mess. Scrolls, broken weapons, tattered remains of books and broken furntature littered the ground about the temple. But she saw a glint of metal amongst the rubble. It was a halberd. &quot;Just my luck&quot; she thought to herself as she picked up the heavy, cumbersome weapon. Lifting it strained her muscles in agony, but she eventually got it up to level with the door, prepared to impale the first orc that came through. And just then, the door crumbled in stone, and there stood the largest, blackest, and meanest looking orc she had ever seen. Frozen in fear, she stood there, looking at this massive snarling beast.<br>
Growling, the beast saw the two veteran warriors, and with a loud call from his deep bass voice, four orcs rushed in and ran past Fenye to attack the two warriors. The sharp ringing of steel hurt her ears, and the large orc soon loomed over her. With one slap of his fist, she flew across the room and slammed into the wall, bright light bursting in the backs of her eyes as her head met concrete.<br>
Insidous laughter echoed the room, and the orc let out a loud war cry as he brought his weapon high to kill the young female in one crushing blow. With almost a planned move, she crossed her index finger with her ring finger, forming them into a rigid weapon that she thrust into his eye, turning is war cry to a loud shout of pain. He took one hand to wash away the gore that flowed onto his face, then brought his arm to slap down the female elf to the ground. He stooped over her, shrieking in pain as his former eye poured out jelly like substance, but his shout raised a few octaves as she swiftly brought  her foot upwards, sending the large orc to his knees and dropping his weapon. <br>
Seeing this moment as the best opportunity she would get today, she stood up, kicking his grimacing face over and over, but without the aid of heavy boots, she was cutting her own feet each time she kicked his large canine teeth.<br>
The orc reached one arm around and grabbed one of her feet.<br>
Her free foot stomped down on his thick wrist, but again, without boots this was to no avail. She realized this and tried to twist her foot to free herself of his grasp. But his other arm grabbed her foot and he lifted upwards, throwing her several feet in the air, and sending her crashing down on the strewn rubble once again.<br>
Stunned, she saw the large orc regaining his feet, then turning to face her, his spiked axe raised high in the air.<br>
In the distance, she saw the other two fighters dispatching the orcs, and although they fared well, she wished they could do so faster, she didn't know how much longer she could keep this up... if she even lived after the next few seconds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave her alone!&quot; shouted a tiny girl-like voice, as a dagger whispered through the air and sank to the hilt in the orc's arm. Werane hopped around like a cricket on a hot kettle as the orc flung pieces of wood, books, and broken metal at her. Easily dodging each of them, Werane flicked another throwing dagger at the orc, but missed, and the dagger pinged sharply off the wall behind him. <br>
The orc moved with amazing speed, and grabbed little Werane in one hand, squeezing her torso with the deep muffled crunch of breaking ribs.<br>
&quot;NO!!&quot; shouted Fenye, picking up the halberd, and with renewed strength charged the massive orc. The sharp tip pierced straight through his thick tunic and tore his flesh, snapping and cracking through bone and sinew, finally coming out the front side. Thick purple blood spewed out of his mouth like drool, and releasing his death grip on Werane he slumped to the ground. Werane fell to the ground, barely breathing, and Fenye's hands shaked uncontrollably as she realized Tunare gave her the strength to kill the foe that killed so many elves, and nearly killed her.<br>
<br>
Everything went black after that, and she lost consiousness soon afterwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bright light blinded her as she woke up, with a cleric peering over her.<br>
&quot;ahh, you are finally awake young one.&quot;<br>
Rubbing her eyes, she sat up, aching and sore all over. She was laying on a mattress of straw and down, along with scores of other wounded. Most of them had grevious wounds, and with the few clerics who were still alive, the healing was going slow. She desperately looked around to find Werane, but she never found anyone that looked like her.<br>
&quot;Where is she?! Where is she?!!&quot; she said as she grabbed the wide eyed cleric.<br>
&quot;Where is who, little one?&quot;<br>
&quot;Werane! Where is she?!&quot;<br>
&quot;I am sorry, I know not of the person you speak of. If you can, take a look around. If she is living, I am sure she will be most happy to see the face of one who knows her.&quot;<br>
Falling to the floor as her weakened legs buckled, she forced herself back up, and began to search the room more thoroughly. The wounded, numbering well over a hundred, Werane was with none of them.<br>
Outside, in the blinding sun, she saw the hundreds of bodies wrapped in white cloth. These were the bodies of the fallen warriors of Tunare who gave thier lives to save the city and it's people. Amongst them, she saw a small, tiny body wrapped in white cloth. A little lock of brown hair had slipped out of the folds and was visible in the light.<br>
Fenye sunk to her knees, crying and sobbing like a mother who lost a child. Her best friend had died to save her life.<br>
<br>
* * * * * <br>
<br>
Many funerals were done that day, and a final one for all the warriors in general. The orcs had been defeated, but so had the spirits and love of the people of Felwithe and Kelethin.<br>
Fenye stood alone, holding a locket she retrieved from Werane's body as a reminder of her lost friend. A hand encompassed her free hand, and with a strong grip. It was General Jyleel's hand. She looked up at his scarred face, a patch over his eye, and his lip had many stitches in the corner of his mouth. His arm was in a sling, and fresh blood soaked through the new bandages, but it did not seem to bother him much at all.<br>
&quot;Fenye,&quot; he whispered, &quot;You realize who you are now, I assume I am correct?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes..&quot; she muttered weakly, holding back from the many tears she was about to shed.<br>
&quot;Then I ask you of this, will you accept my word that I will make you a formidable fighter, so that you will always be able to hold your own, and defend your friends should the need arise?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I will train hard, and I will kill every creature of darkness that opposes the Mother. I will do this for my friend, for me, and for Felwithe. This will never happen again.&quot; she said with a heavy heart.<br>
Jyleel stepped aside, leading her with him, and into the Hall of the Dead. &quot;Along these walls are inscribed all those who have died in the honor of Tunare.&quot; he said as he walked further down to the more recent dates. A smith was carving new names in the wall, but Jyleel pointed at a plaque with some names on it.<br>
&quot;Albert Jyleel.. your son..&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, his name was added last night. His body was found outside the Temple. He died saving the cadets and the Temple. But look at the other names.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aanyinie Starlight.. Sedade Blazespirit.. Werane Kindred...&quot;<br>
&quot;Your friend will not die, but will live on with the noblest of those who have fought, have lived and have served the Mother. She will never be forgotten for all of time, as her name and all the others here have been carved into Obsidian with a diamond knife. They are, in effect, immortal now. You should never forget this, as your friend, like my son, will live on for all of time.&quot;<br>
Tears burst from her eyes, and Jyleel's hand extended to her, and opened. In his palm was a ring, the mark of a Paladin of Tunare.. a Talisman. <br>
&quot;Wear this, and come to tomorrow's practise. I hope to see you there, joyful and ready to learn. Do not be sad, but be happy for your friend, for she has given the greatest sacrifice any could give.. she gave her life to save yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
Holding him in an embrace that would not falter for hours, she managed to whisper in his ear..<br>
