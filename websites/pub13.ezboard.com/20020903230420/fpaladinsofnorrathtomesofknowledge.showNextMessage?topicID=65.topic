Coming from Qeynos hills and facing the gate she is a bit to the left of the gate. Give her 1000pp and the two book parts and you will get the Book of Scale in return. Note that the book IS multiquestable (like any no combine container quest step) and, since the completed 'Book of Scale' <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS DROPABLE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the MQ is very safe to do.<br><br>Travel to The Ocean of Tears, and give the Oracle of Akanon the book, he will give you a Phylactery with the Soul of Miragul in it in return.<br><br>Head to Everfrost with 2-4 groups depending on level and classes and find the Lich of Miragul wandering in the caves under the frozen river. Charm said lich and give him his soul (phylactery) back. That will spawn the live miragul. Keel him and loot his head and cloak.<br><br>Head to the 4th isle in Air, it is called the Pegasus Isle and is non KOS, you will need someone to stay back on the 1st island in the quest Area. Have them find Dason Goldblade and tell him they wish to be tested. He will give whoever is there a book. <br><br>Have them turn in the book to Dason and he will despawn leaving Dirkog Steelhand up instead. Give Dirkog Steelhand 500pp and Inte Akira will pop on isle 4. <br><br>First give him (Inte) your Ghoulbane to get his blessing of nobility, and then give him your Soulfire to get his blessing of sacrifice. Then turn in Miraguls head and cloak along with the two blessings you just received from Inte to get your shiny new Fiery Avenger. <br><br>Please note much like the Soulfire quest, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     give the NPC the ghoulbane and soulfire first</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, so you get his blessings. <br><br>PART II From Allakhazams<br><br><br>To get this weapon, you have to release a tormented soul. To do this, you need to find his old armor, sword and shield. These have to be purified by light, gem and water. <br><br>THE GEM <br><br>These 2 NPC's are found in Kaladim, Jark is in the mines and Nella is outside of the temple <br><br>You say, 'hail Jark' You say, 'some' <br><br>Jark says 'Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich but it'll sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine was supposed ta bring me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my dinner? I aint got nothing ta pay ya with but I sure would appreciate it. <br><br>You say, 'I will get your dinner' <br><br>Jark says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out there somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple so maybe shes there. Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have everythin ready fer me. <br><br>You say, 'hail Nella Stonebraids' <br>You say, 'dinner' <br><br>Nella Stonebraids says 'Ach! I forgot me husbands dinner. Im so sorry. I was sendin my wishes ta Brell for health and long life. I was just floatin coins into the wishin pool. Usually its for children but things havent been so good lately. Here, please take this to him and tell him where I was. <br><br>After you take him his dinner, Jark says 'Har har! No time fer eatin now! While you were gone I struck me a rich vein. Lookie here. Ya ever seen a gem so pure? Its <br>tiny but clear as glass. Ya take it Holyomen . Ya showed me some kindness, least I can do. Besides, still a share here for me. <br><br>THE BREASTPLATE <br><br>The Breastplate comes of a Thought Corruptor in the Plane of Hate and is called a Tainted Darksteel Breastplate. <br><br>THE SWORD <br><br>The Sword can be found on the Keeper of Tombs in The Hole. <br><br>PURE WATER <br><br>Talk to a peasant woman near the monk guild in West Freeport. You say to peasant woman &quot;what water&quot; then &quot;I will take it&quot;. You get a bucket of water. Hand it in to her brother Joshua and it will be turned into Pure water. Joshua is in the bakery near his sister. <br><br>THE SHIELD <br><br>The tainted shield drops off Kirak Vil in Nektulos forest. He is a lvl 56 Dark elf, there are DE faction losses for killing him. <br><br>Now the steps to assemble the items <br><br>1) &quot;The sword must be dipped in water pure.&quot; Give the Tainted Sowrd and the Pure Water (blessed by Sacrifice) to REKLON GNALLEN in the temple of Quellious, Erudin. You receive a Gleaming Crested Sword. <br><br>2) &quot;Light of clean spirit to cleanse the shield.&quot; The Tainted shield goes to Elia the Pure in Felwithe. You receive a Gleaming Crested Shield. <br><br>3) &quot;A gem of clarity unlike any other for the breastplate.&quot; The Tainted Breastplate plus the Pure Crystal received from Jark (blessed by compassion) is given to REKLON GNALLEN in the temple of Quellious, Erudin. You receive a Gleaming Breastplate. <br><br>4) Gleaming Shield, Crested Sword and Breastplate go to REKLON GNALLEN again. You receive a &quot;MARK OF ATONEMENT&quot;. <br><br>5) The Mark of Atonement and the old Fiery Avenger go to IRAK ALTIL (wandering NPC zombie) in Plane of Fear. You receive the Fiery Defender  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A> at: 7/15/02 8:18:07 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showPrevMessage?topicID=54.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showNextMessage?topicID=54.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.emailToFriend?topicID=54.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.threadControl?topicID=54.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=54.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=54.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm21">Class Balancing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge>Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
