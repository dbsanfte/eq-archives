Slowly turning back to the drill instructor he spoke in his deep rasping voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thissss new hatchling.....what issss hisss name&quot;<br>
<br>
Nervously shuffling his clawed feet on the stones drill instructor Mrusk looked up into the War Baron's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hissss name issss Vysssk, Baron.... one of the chosssen brood... the mysssstics have marked him for great thingssssss&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding slowly the War Baron of Cabilis closed his eyes and flicked out his tongue.<br>
<br>
&quot;The youngling, he hasssss been given the sssstore of equipment that the mysssssticssss ssssent for him yessss?&quot;<br>
<br>
The baron looked up at Mrusk's face, noting the quick nod and grinning widely, his serrated teeth glinting in the dim torchlight.<br>
<br>
&quot;Exssssellent, I have been watching hisssss training clossssely.... he isssss very sssstrong for one ssssso young....&quot; pausing he crossed his large forearms over his chest and flicked out his tongue again. &quot;The mysssticssss are very wise in their marking him asssss one of the chossssen.....&quot; making a dismissive gesture at the drill seargent the baron turned slowly and sat down on the ground. &quot;Leave me now, i musssst think&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly Mrusk bowed and backed down the hallway, leaving the War Baron alone with his thoughts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vysssk....&quot; the baron hissed softly &quot;What issss it that the facelessssss hasss planned for you...?&quot; <p><img src=http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/10963039.ptp.gif>

The bandit made a quick feint and threw a scaled fist at his throat. Ducking lithely, Vysk brought his sword back, flexing his biceps and gripping the hilt tightly in his clawed hands before slashing out, scoring a critical hit on the outcast's right leg. Grinning, he pressed his attack throwing a strong kick at the bandit's chest and swinging his blade up and across, carving a deep bloody gash across the chest of his opponent. The bandit looked down, reaching up with a scaly hand to gingerly touch the wound before falling to his knees in the dirt before Vysk.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the name of the empire you foul aborted outcasssst.... DIE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Vysk hissed triumphantly as he swung his sword down, easily decapitating his stunned foe, grinning as a few drops of blood spattered against his breastplate. Taking out a small rag he wiped his blade clean before lifting it over his shoulder and sliding it into the well made sheathe he kept strapped there. Looking around quickly he flicked out his tongue, tasting the air before running off towards Cabilis, he needed to resupply and the war baron had told him that he would personally be undertaking his training.... <br>
<br>
&quot;Ssssso many thingssss to do...&quot; Vysk hissed to himself as he passed under the ornately engraved archway, entering Cabilis. <p><img src=http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/10963039.ptp.gif>

Usssse your ssssword, usssse your ssstrength, your ssssspeed...&quot;<br>
<br>
Vysk looked at the war baron, gripping the hilt of his mithril two hander tightly in his clawed fists, slowly sliding his taloned feet apart, moving into a battle stance as he brought his sword back. The baron stood passively, his eyes shut, his tongue flicking out quickly, tasting the air.<br>
Suddenly Vysk moved, bringing his blade down and across in a slash aimed at the baron's exposed thigh. Within a second he was writhing on the ground, his weapon lying a few feet away. Smirking slightly, his scaled lips curled away from his teeth, the baron looked down at him and hissed.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are fasssst, yessss, but your attackssss lack finesssse. They need refinement...&quot;<br>
<br>
Kicking Vysk in the side the baron motioned for him to get up again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pick up your ssssword, hatchling, repossssition yourssself and try again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wincing, Vysk got up and picked up his sword, rubbing the three painful bruises now forming on his body, one on each arm and one in the center of his chest. There was no dishonor in the fact that the war baron had just laid him out without even breaking a sweat, he was after all, in training. The thing that amazed him was that he hadnt seen the baron move! The strike had been too quick for his reptilian eyes to register. He hadnt even felt the change in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Again! And focussss thisss time.&quot; the baron hissed.<br>
<br>
Slowly Vysk brought his sword back into his battle stance and flexed his sore biceps. Then, without any forewarning he aimed a thrust directly at the baron's face, sending his blade screaming at the calm Iskar before him. Again, he found himself lying on the floor, holding his left wrist in his right hand and moaning softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;You need to lisssssten when i sssspeak to you Vysssk. Never attack angry, you cannot focussss when you do sssso. Calm yoursssself before you thrusssst or sssslassssh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Motioning for one of the guards the baron spoke again.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will go to the myssssticssss for healing, that wrisssst sssshould not delay your training.&quot; he said pointing to the splintered bone protruding from Vysk's wrist.<br>
<br>
As the guard helped Vysk out of the room, the war baron sat down heavily on the ground, slowly reaching a claw up to his forehead and wiping away a line of dark blood which was flowing from the small cut there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very fasssst indeed...&quot; <p><img src=http://pic3.picturetrail.com/VOL22/566694/847606/10963039.ptp.gif>
