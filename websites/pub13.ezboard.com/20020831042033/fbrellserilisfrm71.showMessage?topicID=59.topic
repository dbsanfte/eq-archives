Go to 1 of those archive pages. Do you know what I said in fall 2000? Why I said that not only would no new reservations EVER be added (specifically talking about Velious), but they would slowly fade away over time because the tide turned against them permanently once people like me exposed the fraud the VS list was and helped destroy it. Quite obviously, the exact same abuses are used on every single list, to varying extents.<br>
<br>
Reservations have never worked. My definition of worked is being satisfactory to a significant majority (at least 3 quarters). Reservations lost ANY semblence of credibility at all when things like Planes, Dragons, VS, Trak were all added with no vote. Then, when Adun actually proposed a system that would introduce some equity on reservations and significantly cut down on abuse, moronic populists like Kruunch and Qualter sort of filibustered it by refusing to stop debate and lying to everyone who didn't know the actual details by using the old standard &quot;oh, it's an evil guild plot to enslave you&quot; argument.<br>
<br>
Well guess what? They signed the death warrant of reservations that day. It PROVED, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that pro-reservationists were negotiating in bad faith, and freedom-promoting people such as myself had no use in debating them because all they did was ignore everything we said and turn it into propaganda to use against us, despite the fact that we negotiated in good faith and legitimately tried to come up with a system that was fair for all.<br>
<br>
So basically at that moment I dropped any semblences of compassion and went into full blown cynic mode. You know the old saying, &quot;A conservative is a liberal who's been mugged&quot;? Well it was something like that. I changed from one of the most compassionate and caring about others on the server to someone who rigidly followed my ideology of ending reservations. I no longer was willing to negotiate AT ALL, because I had already been burned a thousand times and was no longer deluding myself to thinking that those people had any ounce of decency left.<br>
<br>
Dels removed VS from reservations. There were HUGE flame wars about it, this board came within inches of dying. However within days something was apparent. Everyone who was upset would NOT get their way, since they were being hypocrites by being upset since there had never been a vote to start them in a first place, and it was blatantly obvious that there was MASSIVE exploitation of the reservation system, focusing on the rent-a-raids where barely level 50 druids would get the same people who went to basically every single VS raid to get their wizard epics/greaves, and in the end, an elite group of people (strangely enough it barely involved guilds like SR, was mostly unguilded) gave people their druid epics for free in exchange for greaves, it was a quid pro quo. It was a sick joke that you were forced to exploit, it was fish or cut bait basically. But remarkably, and I mean it, this is a -shocking revelation-, but I was correct again! There was endless bitching at first, but within months no one cared. Of course I love to rub salt in bleeding wounds and constantly remind people of this, but that's just the kind of person I am.<br>
<br>
Then Velious came. It was specifically designed by Verant to make reservations impossible. It only validated my predictions when all the hubbub about reserving PoG died before it even had a chance? Know why it died? Because no reservation has ever been democratically passed, the only difference was that time we no longer were willing to fall for their tricks and were able to use their stalling tactics on them, giving them a taste of their own medicine that they so deserved. I didn't get all that I wanted, because some people made some poor decision making and eventually started a rotation of ToV. I did all I can to explain what a bad idea that was, but I had already quit the game months earlier and the same quixotic argument that had been used ad-infinitum won once again unfortunately. Unfortunately it has caused many problems since then, if only I was perfect as the ignorant like to claim I believe I am, because that was one thing I would have loved to change.<br>
<br>
That was only a battle though, and I will never sacrifice my ideology for anything. It doesn't matter how many votes can be stuffed in the ballot box, how many low levels that can be scared into the same, tired  argument of rich vs. poor, have vs. havenots, class warfare. It hasn't just been used in Everquest, it's been used in all of politics for centuries where brutal opressors use false claims that suffering will come if they are removed from power, but in actuality are causing the suffering itself. That's the whole flux of my argument, that reservations seriously put a huge gap in the server and basically screwed every smaller guild on the server to never be able to be able to successfully powergame in Everquest. Now I know that people will bring up arguments like &quot;Oh, but I ROLEPLAY, and Powergamers don't have a right to live and are pimply-faced 13 year olds in the basement who have never touched a female breast!&quot; and &quot;But I work! I have a wife and kids! I have a real life, but I should be able to have the same things you have when you play 10 times more than me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Guess what, those arguments are not new, just constantly rehashed as the new flavor of the month whenever these arguments flare up again. Much like people screw themselves by not working hard, becoming lazy, and unable to better themselves via natural selection, people screw themselves in a much similar fashion by supporting reservations. It's basically similar to a slave voting to keep themselves in chains. I cannot fathom why they'd do it besides falling victim to the same old tired arguments, but it still happens I am afraid.<br>
<br>
Go ahead, anyone who likes reservations can have their fun by convincing 100 people to vote and forcing the majority of the server to accept your will. Know what'll happen? Just like Ragefire, when it was CLEARLY illegitimate with no basis, people will ignore them, and your reservations will not be worth the paper they are written on.<br>

using your definition fcfs will never be working for limited encounters. (as soon as there's twice as many people/guilds who want to kill something than its possible to actually kill it because of spawn time half of them will be dissatisfied). <p>Camala Ironarm<BR>

Most of your short examples arent a problem with the reservations, they are a problem with only part of the zone being reserveable and are infact complaints stemmed by the fact that in order to get to the parts of the zone the board people refuse to allow be reserveable are interferring with the reserveable parts.  Please use an example that is not mixed reserveable/FCFS.<br>

<br>
When did I assert that they were? Minute basically said there were no complaints/rants about the planes like there are about Rage......that is patently false.<br>
<br>
&quot;...they are a problem with only part of the zone being reserveable and are infact complaints stemmed by the fact that in order to get to the parts of the zone the board people refuse to allow be reserveable are interferring with the reserveable parts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or....is it that the parts of the zone that are reservable the board people refuse to make FCFS restrict access to quest MOB's like the Golems/Shissar/Broken Golem.  Sort of depends on your point of view.....now doesn't it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please use an example that is not mixed reserveable/FCFS.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well that is the crux of the problem now isn't it?  Any time there are quest MOB's behind/mixed in with reservable MOB's you are going to have problems.  Perhaps that is even why Verant places quest MOB's in areas they are aware that certain servers have on reserved status.<br>
<br>
When the FG reservations were being used to effectively reserve Ragefire they were overridden.  Trak has a quest component for the key to Veeshan's Peak.  There are numerous MOB's in Fear and a few in Hate that are required for completing Epics.  For that reason you continue to have higher level guilds being forced to reserve said zones <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> just</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for a shot at the quest piece.....not for the armor which is the reason for the zone being reservable in the first place.<br>
<br>
When reservations are being made not in the spirit of the original intention of the list.....the reservation list is no longer valid and should be rescinded. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

There is plenty of abuse going on just like there was with VS, just not as obvious.   But *I* see it because I work on the lists all the time.  I see who is making secret alliances with 4 other small guilds so they can get more Naggy/Vox loot for themselves while they sit on the Trak rotation.  I see the level 53+ guilds that are reserving Vox to claim a white scale that they can't even help fight to get.  I see the level 53+ indies taking spots on Vox/Naggy to claim loot that they can't even help fight for.  I see people that claim to be indy sign up that are actually in guilds already on the list.  I see people in guilds try and use friends in other guilds/indies to get them another spot.<br>
<br>
I see it all.  And its not working, because for the most part my hands are tied on trying to prevent it. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=blue,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>

And you are correct Kualane, in my opinion, no more or less.<br>
<br>
I suppose Twiggie I am did not think of guilds taking advantage of Vox Naggy, as it seems so trivial to do.  How often is killing them fun?  Of course this is a question folks will answer for themselves, but since I have had the experience and moved on, I cant imagine someone sitting there to kill them over and over, though I know this to be the case.<br>
<br>
I wonder though my friends, if this is anything new.  In the begining, when there were less guilds looking for the spawns, (and also less content we cannot forget) respective killing of a Vox/Naggy was done and for many of the same reasons I suppose as it is done now: loot and epic pieces.  So odd though dont you think, to farm them for loot.  I think, why not take a Vox Capable crew and kill the Fungy King, or raid SG, or Kael, or any number of places.  But that is just me.<br>
<br>
The bad thing is not that the Mobs are farmed, though I would wish people to be more honorable about it.  No, what bothers me is that it seems to waste your time Twiggie.  The BS Service is really a privilege, and I am offended when petty children abuse it.  I understand your point of view I think, though I do disagree with the original poster, as I think that perspective is to narrow and dark for my tastes, and truthfully in my final judgment, wrong.<br>

<br>
Why are your hands tied?  Most of the rules made on this board are not based on Verant rules and in fact I guess go against them.  I always kind of though we did this because we believe verant to be short sighted morons (atleast I do) that made a game and allowed too many people to come on each server making competition a nightmare, so systems are setup to help making that nightmare not so scarey.  Untie your hands.  You see abuse step on it.  Guild X is on Trak list but getting in on Vox loot.... the guild that is letting them do that should be taken off the vox rotation, simple, clean efficient, abusers should be smacked down.  I just dont see the problem here, you hands are only tied if you allow them to be tied, we are already going against verant policy, all of our system is based purely on respect and server status to not be thought of as the jerk doing xyz.  You bannin guild a for abusing the rules set in place that are there to HELP them will not cause hatred for you by anyone but that guild and who cares about them, they are cheaters screw em.<br>

Because as a member of the Brell moderator and rule making committee (my best description for this board) he helps make the rules, if he doesnt want to enforce them, he shouldnt be making them, and he shouldnt be a moderator.  I have much respect for Twiggie and all the other people that donate a ton of their time to try to make Brell the best server it can be.  But if we are going to setup such rules we need to enforce them otherwise, why even have the rules or the board.  I think one of the biggest reasons he doesnt is because he doesnt want the backlash.   Thats where every guild and person that supports any reservation system or any such system we put in place as a community to overcome Verants shortsightedness needs to also support the rules we put in place and when someone breaks those rules, they need to step behind Twiggie 100% in decisions on sanctions against the few that want to exploit and manipulate the system that they wanted to be there in the first place.  Twiggie already said he sees all the rule breakers.  So he is already policing it in a sense, he just isnt sanctioning those that he sees breaking the rules.  Maybe he is in some situations where the abuse is outrageous and he feels he wont get much backlash from others, but I guess Twiggie will have to correct me if I am wrong, I believe one of the big reasons he doesnt is because his job is a thankless one already, the last thing he needs is the board and his /tell screen to be filled up with rants because he removed guild x off the vox list for exploiting the list.  <br>

<br>
First off, every time I even make the slightest change in wording of the rules I get a horde of people jumping on my ass because we didn't take a &quot;vote&quot; to make the changes, EVERY F'ING TIME.   So why should I even bother when I have to take WEEKS of votes, and polls, and comments, and arguements just to make the smallest change.  Everyone has it in their mind that EVERYTHING should be voted on.  Nothing was ever PUT IN by a vote, NOTHING.<br>
<br>
You want me to make rules stopping this abuse, fine, but don't come whining and bitching because I didn't let you vote on it.<br>
<br>
As for those abusing the system they aren't breaking any rules, they are breaking the spirit of the rules.  There is nothing in the rules saying a level 55 bard in a guild that can't even supply a single group of 46-52 level players can't reserve Vox, nothing.  There is nothing in the rules saying that a guild of 100+ people that is on the Trakanon list can't &quot;help&quot; kill Vox/Nagafen on a &quot;closed&quot; raid between the lower guild on the list and the larger guild.<br>
<br>
You can't make rules to cover that last situation, because there is no way to police it without making the rules so restrictive that they don't work for anyone.<br>
<br>
I see these things every day because I'm the only one taking care of the lists, visiting each and every guild's message board that are on the list, getting email about abuses, seeing the sign up lists every time, etc etc.   There is very little I could do to stop some of it.  If you try and make it to restrictive you will end up just having people say screw it and just jump the reservations and kill it anyway. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=blue,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>

I can understand that, and if you read my entire post you will see I even covered that.  I specifically said we need to support you in enforcing such policies, and even in editing some policies.  Not everything needs a vote.  If you are referring to the Trak vote up now, come on Twiggie, going from reservation to FCFS isnt a &quot;slight change&quot; its a massive overhaul in how the spawn will be dealt with, not a tweak on rules to make them more closely fit the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rules as they were intended.  I cant win from losing here, I even post telling ppl they need to give Twiggie more room to maneuver and I get lashed out at /sigh<br>

I don't blame the guilds, the people, etc for the various failures of the reservation system.<br>
<br>
I blame Verant.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Static spawns with static (or semi-static) loot are the real cause of the problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showMessageRange?topicID=59.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showMessageRange?topicID=59.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showMessageRange?topicID=59.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showPrevMessage?topicID=59.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showNextMessage?topicID=59.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=59.topic&index=20><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.threadControl?topicID=59.topic><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/del1.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=59.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=59.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm70">News and Events<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">The Outer Realm (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm73">New User Interface<option value="brellserilisfrm56">The Hall of Honor<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">The Fellowship of Guilds<option value="brellserilisfrm53">The Valley of Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm72">Ickhor's WC3 house<option value="brellserilisfrm66">The Back Alley (Link to Rants)<option value="brellserilisfrm71">Raids: Discussion<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (BUYING)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Selling and Trading)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">Spells, Research and Gems</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71>Raids: Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
