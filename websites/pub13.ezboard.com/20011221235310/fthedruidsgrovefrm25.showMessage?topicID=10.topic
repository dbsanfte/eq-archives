I have often lamented that I did not start on RZ from the beginning, but I joined the friend that introduced me to the game on Sol Ro.  I don't have a character on a PK server over level 10 so far, and that is SZ.<br>
<br>
With SZ up, and DAC coming out soon, lots of the focus in the MMORPG world is on PvP.  Basically, how do we protect a good game from griefers while maintaining the human combat element that gets us PKers heart thumping.  What I want to do is present the system from the MUD Medievia, copyright and all rights reserved yadda yadda (www.medievia.com).  It may have changed in the 2 years I have been playing EQ, but I thought it was a great system, stressing that it was YOUR choice whether or not to enter PvP.  If you were a griefer, there were consequences to pay.<br>
<br>
First, there were three types of areas/zones:<br>
LPK - Lawful.  Normally no PvP attacks can be initiated.<br>
NPK - Neutral.  PvP attacks may be initiated by any person on any person and long as both parties are 19th level or higher.  If you are PKd, you are deposited with 1hp and no mana in the wilderness outside the zone (which may put you at risk from mob death).  No item, money, or xp loss possible.  You cannot initiate a PvP battle with a person that is in combat with a mob, tho a mob can join in after you attack.  Etiquette in this case dictates you call of the attack, and was enforced by GMs if they witnessed it.<br>
CPK - Chaotic.  PvP attacks may be initiated by any person on any person.  Any death in this area yields a fully lootable corpse - everything, as long as the people have slots, but the corpse does not last more than one minute.  Players can assist/heal mobs.  A PK death causes you to lose xp (NPC deaths did not cause xp loss in this game).  You can never lose a level, but you can get into an xp "hole", think of it at having 6 yellows TNL.<br>
<br>
You could play the entire game, from 1 to HERO (124 levels, 31 x four classes), without ever getting into a PK situation.  HOWEVER, the best xp mobs in any level range existed in NPK areas, as well as mid-level equipment.  95% of the best items in the game for high-levels came from CPK areas, or required going through them.  Generally, you would require a group of HERO or near-HERO chars to fight in a CPK area.  Also, some trade-route shortcuts were CPK.  The majority of the populace exclusively used LPK or NPK areas.<br>
<br>
The griefing problem in NPK was solved as follows:  When you got an NPK kill on someone, you recieved 'BLOOD' time.  The amount of time was based on the level difference between you and the attacker, with additional blood if you initiated the attack.  While you had blood on you hands, you could not run to an LPK area for safety - a player with blood on their hands could be attacked anywhere except for Med city, and if they sat in Med city, their blood time would not go down.<br>
<br>
Naturally the most powerful guilds did the CPK areas and farmed the phat l3wts.  But what stopped one clan (guild) from being over-powerful to the demise of all others?  Clan size limits.  Why didn't they just create sister clans?  Because each clan was individually ranked on several stats, and these sister clans of the most "uber" folks always ended up in competition with each other.<br>
<br>
Those that never wanted to brave CPK could always buy hand-me-down gear from the ubers.  There was a global auction system (this was abusable for transporting money and items across the world..).  Money had uses in that you needed it to maintain your clantown.<br>
<br>
All in all, the system worked pretty well.  Certainly people grief-killed, but not to a huge extent.  And under normal circumstances, your loss was minimal if you were grief killed, and if your level 20 butt got slain by a hero, that guy would be bloody enough for your own clan's heroes to chase them down.  And if you didn't want to PK - you could make the money in LPK areas to buy PK area gear.<br>
<br>
There was more... hero-battles, kingdom wars, etc.  But the gist of it is it incorporated the possibility of avoiding PK alltogether and progressing reasonably anyway, rewards for risking PvP, consequences for grief-killing, and limitation on the possible power base of single guilds along with a motivation for keeping seperate powerful guilds in conflict.  This was pretty good.<br>
<br>
I think DAoC is doing a lot of this! <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usanterre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santerre</A> at: 7/13/01 9:55:43 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showMessage?topicID=8.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showMessage?topicID=2.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25>PvP</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
