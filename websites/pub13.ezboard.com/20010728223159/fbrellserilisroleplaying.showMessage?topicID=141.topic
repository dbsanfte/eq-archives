Her body had changed.  Her chest had rounded, the fat fallen from her waist.  Her chubby cheeks were hollow and her mouth fuller.  Her arms and legs were longer, more gangly.   Cerres turned sideways.  She turned backward and looked over her shoulder.  She knelt and put her face closer to the pond.  She still didn't see it.  <br>
<br>
Cerres took a fresh berry from her pouch and extended her hand to a large white and orange spackled Koi.  &quot;Here you go,&quot; she said as he swam and took the berry from her hand.  &quot;Do YOU think I'm beautiful?&quot; she asked the fish.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Very.&quot;  Cerres jumped.  She turned and saw Master Jycinth standing near the bench.  Cerres blushed from peach to raspberry and back again while she stared at the ground.  &quot;You don't have to be embarassed.&quot; Jycinth added.  &quot;Do you really not know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres looked up at him and shook her head.  &quot;Come, sit down and talk.  Class doesn't start for a little while.&quot;  Cerres sat on the bench next to him.  The wren trilled out a new song &quot;Come build a nest with me&quot; it said.   It's mate answered.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So what brings this on?&quot;  Jycinth asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just seem to hear it a lot lately.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;From boys?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And men, &quot; Cerres added, finding it hard to compare Serda with Sytal and the other boys at the Academy.  And then there was Lamendor who had followed her around making boorish comments all of yesterday.  &quot;Sometimes, it's nice.  But sometimes...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes you'd rather not have their attention?&quot;  Jycinth said, finishing her sentence for her. <br>
<br>
Cerres perked up. &quot;Exactly.  Like yesterday.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, your holiday.  How was it?&quot;  Jycinth interupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was fun.  You were right, the ruins were spectacular.  It's hard to think lizards could build such a civilaztion.  Are they really smart?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some scholars think so.  Most don't.&quot;  Jycinth said, sadness in his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;But you do.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.  I think the difficulty is in difference of experience.  Our thinking, logic, everything in our culture is based on our experiences of life.  When faced with something completely foreign, it seems less intellligent because, to us, it makes no sense.  For example, what would you think if I went and buried my herbs instead of hanging them on the rafters every fall?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres thought a minute.  &quot;I'd think it strange.  They'd mold and rot.  You have to dry them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you wouldn't think me intelligent, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres  furrowed her brow.  She knew Master Jycinth well enough to know that no question with a simple and obvious answer was a simple and obvious question.  She tried to think of where it would be smart to bury herbs and suddenly smiled.&quot;Unless you were a Barbarian and lived in Halas where the ground is frozen.  The herbs wouldn't rot frozen underground, in the ice.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Exactly.  So with Iksar, we know so little about Kunark that it seems as if everything they do is strange.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres sat back on the bench watching new ideas explode, sending questions scurrying around in her mind.   &quot;Does that fit everyone, you think?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jycinth asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, is all behavior we think is stupid really just something we don't understand.  Like Sytal always going on and on about how special his voice is.   He knows everyone laughs about it behind his back, but he keeps doing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, now you have posed a very interesting question.  Young Sytal may be the exception that proves the rule.&quot;  Cerres laughed.  &quot;Although, many people do things that make others laugh behind their backs.  Even you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me?  Oh, you mean history.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jycinth smiled.  &quot;No, actually, I was thinking more about talking to that fish.&quot; Cerres blushed again.  &quot;For someone like me, it seems a very strange question indeed.  Still, I am not the one attracting unwanted attention.  At least, not from beautiful young girls.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, you might consider yourself lucky in that regard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, then, what am I missing?&quot; Jycinth asked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, for one thing complete strangers don't stare at you, whisper among themselves and smirk when you go for a swim.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, but they do.&quot;  Jycinth reminded Cerres.   Cerres started to apologize.  &quot;No need for apologies.  It has long since ceased to concern me.  Every gift has a price, Cerres.  This&quot; he said indicating his frail body, &quot;is the price for my scholarship.  I would never have studied philosophy had I not been bedridden in my youth.  And what wealth I would have lost.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So I&quot;m really beautiful?&quot; Cerres asked, still finding the concept strange.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your looks are as beautiful as your voice.  There is not a man in Norrath who will be able to keep his heart, lass.  Not a man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres pouted.  &quot;I don't want every man's heart.  And I especially don't want some men's hearts.&quot;  she added, thinking again of Lamendor laying himself at her feet and begging to be her slave and in front of everyone.   She was still humiliated.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want, Cerres?&quot;  Jycinth asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want one man's heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyone in particular?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cerres sighed staring at the water gurggling in the fountain.  &quot;I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  Not like mother, anyway.  She knew the minute she laid eyes on Daddy she was in love.  She even bought a painting of him and put it over her bed, before she thought he even knew she existed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;So you want that kind of passion.  The kind that blazes intensely and then quickly burns itself out?&quot;  Jycinth said, thinking sadly of Cerres' mother.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Only with a happy ending.&quot;  Cerres sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot;All consuming passion never has a happy ending.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres listened again to the wren calling it's mate.  This time there was no answer.   She looked at Jycinth and said, &quot;Or, maybe it does, but we just don't understand it.&quot;<br>
