She turns into a light blue con at 55 and green at 57. <br>She drops experience at a rate between one blue bubble in 90 minutes and three blue bubbles in five hours at 54-56. So to get you through 54 at a constant grind, plan on just 38 to 42 hours. I usually got a full blue bubble of experience an hour at least as a 53rd level. <br>Loot tends to be 2-5pp usually with bronze weapons and 60-80pp gems (star ruby, fire emeralds) being uncommon/rare drops. <br>Cyndreela is fast easy experience. Load up on magic and poison resistance gear, at 55 I just went for AC gear and took her down with no worry on her spells harming me. Not sure of the minimal level to try her but I'd say for a paladin 50-51 is probably the lowest I would go in order to resist her fear spells if she lands them. <br>Respawns every 5 minutes, with EqAnnounce ( from mailto:EQAnnounce@hotmail.com ) I can sit and meditate and wait for the verbal announcement she is due to pop. Easy camp, you can watch TV or do other stuff without worry. <br>She casts fear and fear2 constantly, easily resisted. Only landed about 3% of the time and wore off fast. I countered this be turning on walk and facing away from the portal when engaging with her so I was never feared into the Fear portal. The only other spell she frequently casted on me was a poison DD spell which was a quick cast and did anywhere from 13-130 damage. She likes this spell a lot but usually just tries to fear all the time. You can tell what she is casting by the sound of the spell casting and the text message - so be a paladin and interrupt with stun spells or bash. She also used dispel magic several times when I first engaged her. She rarely casts the Scourge spell, which is a minor Disease DoT that gives you nothing to worry about. The only time she presents a challenge is when she is already up and has a pet. Fear/root pet on pull and she goes down fast. After the first kill I sit beside her spawn point on the ramp, facing away from the fear portal and attack her immediately as she spawns. If you do not immediately engage her when she spawns she puts up a damage shield. I used my stun spells to chain-stun and chain-DD-stun her and with a fast attack she goes down quick. She only has 1500hps usually, max I ever encountered was 1702 (verified by log/EqAnnounce). Sometime she goes down without delivering any melee and/or spell damage if you play your cards right. <br>As a paladin I had root, cancel magic, all my stuns, and buff spells up. Initially I had undead spells up put after the first kill she will never have her pet again and spectres don't venture inside by the portal. <br>Cyndreela tends to walk towards the tunnel to Feerot when low on hitpoints which can aggro drybone skeletons on you which are minor annoyances. If she makes it to the tunnel (fake wall) there is a spectre that spawns there occasionally. I only aggroed that spectre once in 5 hours. Spectres are usually green at 55 but once in a while you get a light blue con. Fighting the spectres is not mana-efficient though.<br><br>LOWER GUK (Dead Side)<br>Maps: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/lowerguk.html">www.eqatlas.com/lowerguk.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Beastiary: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=49">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?zone=49</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Solo Levels: 53-60<br><br>Dead Side (map: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/lgukdeadmap.html">www.eqatlas.com/lgukdeadmap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) <br>Solo the hall outside the Arch Magi room (number 5 on the Dead Side map) for faster experience then in a group or waiting for a group anywhere else. It is very simple to single pull the two Arch Magi room spawns. Peek around the corner a bit and the one closest one to you will aggro. If you happen to pull both root the add and fight or root both and camp out. <br>Pulling in the Dead Side is usually fairly simple. Just cast Invisibility vs. Undead (IvU) on yourself and run up to a blue con mob and either attack it or pull it back to your safe spot. If you mess up root the mob(s), go IvU and head back to your safe spot to camp. <br>One mob you may want to worry about is the Dar Ghoul Knight (level 39-43) that spawns closest to the Lord room (map location number 3). If you aggro the Dar Ghoul Knight too close to the Lord room, then the Lord (level 47) and numerous other mobs tend to aggro. Just wait for the Dar Ghoul Knight to wander away from the room before pulling him. <br>If there happens to be an Arch Magi room group there already don't bother to solo here and just leave. There really are not enough spawns for the both you and the group. This also tends to raise the risk of trains and corpse retrieval here when soloing is usually a big PITA. I only usually die at this camp due to Arch Magi room group trains.<br>Live Side (map: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/lguklivemap.html">www.eqatlas.com/lguklivemap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) <br>King Room - can be solo pulled at level 58+. This can also be pulled at level 54-57 if the tactician area if not up. Here is how to do it: <br>Really easy, cast invisibility on yourself, and run down to king room. Pull with cancel magic. <br>There's a hallway there with 1 roamer. Kill it, time it, and pull your mobs into the hallway. When you fight king, use your array of stuns spells. <br>The King is soloable at 54 if you play your cards right. <br> <br><br>NAGAFEN'S LAIR (aka Sol B)<br>Map: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/nagafenslair.html">www.eqatlas.com/nagafenslair.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Beastiary: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=50">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?zone=50</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Solo Levels: 52-60<br>Mob Sonic Bats (levels 38-42) <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3269">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3269</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>If you have a good weapon and haste (plus Valor of Marr), you can solo Sonic Bats in Sol B easily...through 54...just count on zoning every now and then from Lava Duct Crawler/Noxious Spider trains. My favored spot for camping is by the zone-in point at the back of Bat 4. That's the one to the left of the route to the Stone Spider room. It can be reached easily via Sol A, using the secret wall by the High Shaman room. Spawns are 3-4 bats. Watch out for the Noxious Spider, just OOC it is there for killing and ignore it - it has mega hitpoints and is rather nasty. To split the spawn, a DW helm is a must, really... otherwise you can't keep up with the re-spawn. Occasionally you may also run into the invisible Guano Harvester (level 25) who drops the common Large Soiled Bag or the Cloak of Shadows, I usually caught him before he went cast invisibility.<br>Lava Duct Crawlers (levels 43 -45) <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3274">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3274</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Lava Duct Crawlers (LDC's) have significantly less hitpoints than the spiders in Velketor's Labyrinth, roughly 2k or so. So if you are smart about buffs you can dispel the DoT's they tend to do (via Cancel Magic or Cancel Magic Effect on the Deepwater Gloves). You can basically solo on these up to level 60. <br>Note that Lava Duct Beetles (38-42) also offer fair experience.<br><br>NERIAK COMMONS<br>Map: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/neriakcommonsmap.html">www.eqatlas.com/neriakcommonsmap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Beastiary: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=34">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?zone=34</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>Solo Levels: 50-54<br><br>Pull guards past the Priest of Discord.

Two spawns are right at the entrance and you can always zone if you get into trouble. People also tend to help you when you are pulling these with a little buff or heal now and again. Just remember to root the mobs and stagger the spawn.<br>The Lost Valley in the Dreadlands (map: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/dreadlandsvalleymap.html">www.eqatlas.com/kunark/dr...eymap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) <br>Plaguebone Thieves at the large abandoned Ancient Combine Wizard Portal Spires in the Lost Valley give fair experience through level 53 to which they are a blue con. They are light blue cons at 55 and experience here seems to be similar to Cyndreela at the Fear portal. <br>There is one building here with 8-12 Plaguebone Thieves which tend to respawn every 10-15 minutes. These skeletons are fast easy kills with Valor of Marr and Instrument of Nife both up. Pull from outside the building and you will only get single mobs. Occasionally a Greater Spurbone Skeleton (of similar level as the Thieves) will walk by or stop outside the building.

Add in self haste (valor of Marr and equipment) and just melee the mobs down. Try to cast as little as possible other than Celestial Cleansing (when you get the spell that is). <br>Small Mushrooms in The Deep or Fungus Grove are the easiest because they have some weird thing about chain stunning and chain slowing you.

Load up an enduring breath item, Instrument of Nife, your best offensive gear and kick arse. <br>The only quirk about The Grey is that there are many &quot;static&quot; spawns. Why is this important to know? If you end up having to bail to zone these &quot;static&quot; monsters aren't programmed to move to move anywhere. So when you zone they stand at the spot you left them when you zone forever. If you aren't careful or other people aren't careful you can have a huge collection of monster parked right at the zone entrance just by blindly training them to zone. If you are a nice Paladin you'll run then away from the zone line, root them and then zone. <br>I was soloing skeletons in The Grey fairly easy at 56.
