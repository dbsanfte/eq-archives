Also this is for duels, not PvP servers. I will eventually get around to playing on a PvP server but I have to many people I know and love on my current server to switch right now. As always patches may have changed some of this, as well as error on my part. I do not feel like changing anything right now, jsut wanted to get something on this forum.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I play on Druzzil Ro, im a 56 Paladin currently I am 41 wins and 8 losses that I have recorded, there have been plently of other fights though that I fought before I started keeeping stack or that I forgot about. Here is my opinion on each class in PvP<br>
<br>
<br>
Bard-draw, they can never kill a pally, but with selos nobody can catch them, if you find a bard who does not run away when they are losing you can win though<br>
<br>
Paladin-depends on equipment an player<br>
<br>
SK- hardest class to fight, our big advantage here is that our heal spells are better than thier life taps imo, and though lay hands is much bigger than HT, you need to remember to LoH at around a bub and a half of life or more, try to figure out how much dmg they do with HT, and LoH a bit before you get to that much life.<br>
<br>
Ranger- Fairly easy to beat, just joust them, which I will explain later, though you do need enough MR to resist Snare. If they start to try to kite you with their flimsy nukes, just stop and start healing yourself, our heals are more mana efficient then their nukes.<br>
<br>
Beastlord- I have not fought one before, but it seems flash of light on the pet, then beat down on the Beast who is just a weak monk shoudl work.<br>
<br>
Magician- same as Beastlord, Flash or Light or Root the pet, then chase the mage around, be sure to heal yourself if you get under half.<br>
<br>
Necro- They do not do dmg fast enough to kill you, spook the dead the pet, then chase the necro, you need to get good at cornering ppl then hitting them as they try to get around you for all int casters. Be sure to stop and heal youself, they will see you casting and stop to lifetap or Dot you, this is a perfect chance to get a hit in because they are standing still casting.<br>
<br>
Enchanter- get MR as high as possible, all thier spells are magic based, if you can get you MR up they cant debuff you, and even without debuffs on they do not have the mana to kill a pally since their DD and Dots suck, kind of annoying if they land a mez or charm though. If they have pet up they cant do that since pet will break mez and you cant be charmed if they have a pet.<br>
<br>
Wizard- if you can resist root then just watch for shadowstep, perhaps pull out a shield if you need to, so you can stop those big nukes, other than that just chase them around, they used to not have the mana to kill me, but now with innate crits and lures, its getting harder.<br>
<br>
Cleric-Nothing they can do, not enough mana to kill you and melee sucks, just beat them up. If they manage to CH themselves all they are doing is prolonging the inevitable<br>
<br>
Druid-If you can resist snare, they are screwed, I once fought a druid and did not take a single point of dmg because I had my MR at around 113.<br>
<br>
Shaman- Heal yourself whenever at half, cast cure / counteract disease to dispell slows if they cast one, most shammies I have fought did not have the mana to kill me between heal spells, lay hands, and the hp of a tank class, so they have to resort to melee and just cant stand up to a pally.<br>
<br>
Warrior- Joust, I will explain at the bottom, other than that, if they have low MR stun them, if you get low root and heal. You may not be able to root because of MR, but you shoudl be able to get off a heal anyway if you are fast enough.<br>
<br>
Rogue- Joust just like warrior and ranger, also dont let them get behind you and make sure you have a see invis item or they will just hide whenever you are about to swing at them.<br>
<br>
Monk- Joust, now I will explain since monk is last, this is when you get a big two hander, put an auto attack button in your hotbank, run by the person you are dueling, and turn auto attack on, then turn it off again right away. The hotbutton will darken, then light up again when you can swing, once it is lit up, run in for another swing. Try to time it so you run by and slash, then turn around and run back, and by the time you are to the person again you are ready to attack. This way they advantage of having fast weapons is taken away, since Monks Warriors Rangers and Rogues on average use fast low dmg weapons, they will only get in a few hits for 30 while you get get in one big hit for 140. Considering you have more hp than rogues monks and rangers, and with LoH and Heal spells you have more hp and warriors, that ratio is not very good for them.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this was a bit long, If anyone has anything I missed or if I am doing something that can be improved upon please tell me, you still need to improvise at times, such as a monk using a big two handed staff, flying kicking for massive dmg, and wearing a fungi tunic, then jousting does not work as well. With these methods I have only lost two duels against people 4 levels above me and lower, both were to SKs and I have improved myself so that will not happen anymore ( I had really bad resists so they could fear me but now I have around 120 MR)<br>
