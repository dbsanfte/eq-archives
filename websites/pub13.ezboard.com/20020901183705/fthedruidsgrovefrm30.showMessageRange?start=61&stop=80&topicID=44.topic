nice analysis. I always go for a little less potential healing to keep the cleric nut cases off of my back, although your number are more fair. <br>
<br>
but I do agree with this:<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 <br>
Where should druids and shaman be? Back up to where they were: around 75% of the cleric healing power. That could be a direct heal for 75% of the average CH heal for a level 60 cleric. That could be a lesser direct heal combined with a group heal similar to the paladins'. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Althogh just to keep the whiny little punks off of our backs how about we say only 66% as effective. That makes the CH cost 600 mana. Hmmm...<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think you are correct about the 66% as efficient - however, I disgree that it should be make via the spell cost - rather it should be via how it heals.<br>
<br>
CH heals ALL the HP you have currently lost. So, a 66% heal should logically heal 66% of the HPs you are currently missing. <br>
<br>
10 sec and 400 mana - just like a cleric heal - which heals 66% * (Max HP - Current HP). That way we dont have to argue how much a CH lands for on average either - because your new heal would land for 66% of that.<br>
<br>
Despite your very arrogant manner of posting my reply is actually serious. A &quot;partial&quot; CH made in this manner would give druids the same fun of landing heals as late as possible to get the best ratio as clerics presently experience. <br>
<br>
Time to think outside the box, dont you think? As to what clerics then need to retain usefullness outside raids - thats another matter entirely.<br>

<br>
Clerics have an absolute monopoly on raiding.  No one can replace them, under any circumstances.  And you need more of them than any other class to achieve anything.<br>
<br>
A cleric's healing kit is far more flexible and rich than any other classes.  Leave aside (as if you could) CH for just a moment.<br>
<br>
Clerics have the best hp/mana ratios, a variety of direct heal, heal over time, group heal, and reverse dmg shield spells.  They have rezzes in a variety of flavors, including the single most valuable epic in the game, bar none.  Now throw in CH.  And group CH.  <br>
<br>
A cleric rarely gets to use the other skills they do have because their monopoly on CH forces most clerics attending a raid into the CH chains...and those not in the chains are covering the SA/TA and other meleers as they can.  <br>
<br>
Clerics also have a lock on some of the most important raid buffs.  You probably have not heard the groaning when a 60 cleric is not on the raid and tanks have to make do with POTG instead of Aego.<br>
<br>
It is not that you can't nuke or cast other useful spells, your role prevents you from having the opportunity. <br>
<br>
That said, if it stopped being the case that clerics were the sole proprietors of all raiding everywhere in the game, I am all for compensating them with something else.<br>
<br>
It is just...wrong...that clerics are the single class that wields that kind of influence in the game, and that the entire playability of the game is balanced around just them. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 7/9/02 9:17:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhuzurdadi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Huzurdadi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/02 8:40:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH and Manaburn</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

At 1st when I saw your proposal I thought to myself: &quot;Jezze, I think that is functionally equivalent.&quot; But then as I was writing this I realized it's not. The spell you are proposing would be take (in effect) 50% more time to cast and 50% more mana (in effect), and would have some weird side effects. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure that druids deserve to be that far behind clerics. We'll have to see what VI does.<br>

That's pretty close to what I expected the cleric response to be. Waaa I won't raid anymore. And since I have a lock on raiding you better not piss me off. Next you'll be suggesting a rez strike if druids get something like CH. <br>
<br>
I love clerics.<br>
<br>
So let's put it to a vote. Which class is more overpowered:<br>
<br>
1. The necromancer of 1999<br>
2. The cleric of ... of ... well let's say today (since clerics just getting more and more powerful as tanks get more and more HP), but they have been powerful for a LONG time.<br>

You're so completely and utterly biased against Clerics that it is impossible for you to be reasoned with.<br>
<br>
Toodles and take care mein freund.<br>
<br>
Resses?  This is the one thing that keeps getting thrown up in our faces.  First of all, we are one of three classes that can Rez and Clerics don't really view this as sacred territory.  Most of us are willing to let the Necros and Pallies have their Resses because, quite frankely, they are a damn good thing to have around sometimes.  As has been said before though, if you take away Clerics &quot;lock&quot; on CH, it's actually BETTER to just camp a couple of Clerics out at a Raid for Ressing if you wipe.  No worries about if the Cleric camped since you have a spare one.<br>
<br>
Oh and for the record, I CAN solo if I want.  It's slow, it's horribly inefficient and it's risky as hell but I CAN.  This also puts me in the minority though since I'm relying on my Flowing Thought, my Horse and my Chardok Ring as a Damage Shield.  I make no bones about it, I'm very well equipped and it's that combo of Mana + Hitpoints on my gear that allows me to actually solo.  On a good day, I can rake in a WHOOPING blue or two an hour of AA exp turned to 100%.  Compare this to a Melee or a Solo Class (Druid, Shaman, Necro, Mage, Wizzy, hell even Enchanters with Charm).  Any soloer who knows what they're doing can make a solid yellow or two an HOUR and even more than that with C3.  It was once determined that at an optimal setup (C3, high FT, free Roots, Free Undead Dot) we still can NOT do a full yellow of AA Exp in an hour.<br>
<br>
In case you guys haven't noticed yet or are not there yet, doing AA experience is TOTALLY different than doing regular exp.  Clerics are NOT needed for this since the goal is to constant pull the lowest level Dark Blue mobs available.  Wander over to Fungus Grove or Velks Lab where you have a majority of Level 60's and you'll see what I mean.  Melee, including Warriors, can solo here with the Gear available and the AA skills open.  Regen 3, Enchanced Bind Wounds, Natural Durability and you have a Warrior that is capable of soloing a mob and only lose a bub or two of health and then regen/heal themselves up and go right back at it again.  In this type of scenario, a Druid is GREATLY desired over a Cleric since you're able to keep the pace going fast by adding in damage AND heals.  Clerics don't add this in and a HP/AC buff is greatly diminished when the Melee already has 1400 AC and 4-5k UNBUFFED.  All we can do is Heal here and that actually SLOWS exp down since we're &quot;leeching&quot; off of the Melee and taking a share of the Exp for casting a single Complete Heal once every 5 minutes.  Places like CT are the exception and not the rule where a Cleric IS still needed.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, this is one of the Boards I used to really enjoy coming to.  It is so completely different than other Class Boards.  During this time I have seen countless posts about how Druids can solo this or solo that.  How 100pp is NOTHING to pay for a C3 donation due to your ability to make 5 times that by the time C3 wears off.  It's a refreshing change to see how Druids are so active about their class and so powerful in what they ARE able to do.<br>
<br>
Because of how much attention I paid to this, yes I DO understand your frustrations and concerns about a Raid setting.  And I DO agree that you could use something to enhance Raid desirability.  I see it in my Guild along with any other.  Druid Recruiting is closed and we're comfortable with our numbers since you don't bring anything &quot;drastic&quot; to the Raid.  However, Complete Heal is NOT the answer for the reason that has already been mentioned.  It completely puts a Cleric out of a job.<br>
<br>
Let's make an agreement right here.  The Clerics are more than willing to acknowledge that Druids need some sort of Raid style enhancement.  In return, you need to understand that Clerics have our own set of shortcomings and problems. <p>Venerable <A Href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" Style="text-decoration: none">Quistil Angelwatch</a><br>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare <br>

Still feel that manaburn in its current form is good for nothing but exploits or trivializing raid content.  ie throw enough manaburn wizzies at it and they can kill anything.<br>
<br>
I don't want toys.  I want to deal with a fundamental class balance and game structure issue.  Clerics have too much political and real power in this game.<br>
<br>
To Lassa, it is not really what we want per se, but fact is many of us are not nuking, dotting or debuffing anyway.  We are often thrown in the healing role and asked to make do keeping the melees up and the AoE dmg healed.  We just do it with crap tools.<br>
<br>
I imagine it would suck to be tied to the chain all the time.  However, if more classes could do it no one would always be shouldering the burden.  And more to the point, if more classes could cast it an entire guild would not be prevented from raiding because one or two of the clerics actually went to the movies tonight. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 7/9/02 9:41:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulassa57.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lassa57</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/02 9:54:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Dear Oldaoktree:<br>

I do know that the druid needs help in the high end game.  But I think you would be much happier with the 1.5-2k direct heal than the CH. <br>
 If you look at all those clerics in these high end guilds, you will see that a large number of them are some Warrior or monks twinked out, Pleveled, two box and is only brought on raids to be in the CH chain and to Plevel their owners.  The life of a high end raid cleric in a hard charging guild is around 6-8 months before they burn out and either quit, or or start up an alt.

<br>
At any rate, yah I know the cleric burn out.  But again I think it is one of the reasons the pain shoudl be spread.<br>
<br>
I can't tell you how many clerics I have watch burn out.  And yes, my guild has always leaned heavily on (and sometimes completely relied on) twink clerics to do what we gotta do.<br>
<br>
hell I am trying to build one myself atm.  I don't really like healing and as a druid I did a lot of it leveling up, but my guild has a greater need for cleric healing than druid healing or nuking on most raids, and my druids are always well represented.<br>
<br>
Now mind you, I have never gotten any twink past 12.  I love my druid and don't really want to play anything else.  But I know I could contribute more many nights with a cleric.<br>
<br>
Even if I were a blithering moron for CH rots, I know that as a backup cleric I woudl not be watching the rangers, rogues, and 4th and 5th warriors die like I do when I am asked to heal them with my druid on a raid.<br>
<br>
A decent direct heal would help, but it still doesn't help prevent cleric burn out and the dependence of a raiding guild on having 6 to 12 active committed clerics.  That is hard as hell to get for most guilds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaeloryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeloryn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>First Post!</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/02 10:20:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH and Manaburn</span><hr size=1> Here's my opinions and rambling discourse on this discussion.<br>
<br>
1. Druids feel useless in raids and aren't wanted by the big raiding guilds.<br>
<br>
2. Clerics only feel wanted for raiding at the high end and it's specifically due to the single lock ability they have: healing and CH.<br>
<br>
Druid players who've posted here with a bad attitude towards clerics should play a cleric for a while. Life sucks without invis, sow, and snare. Getting from point A -&gt; B is a headache (not even talking about ports). ITU is largely useless and you can buy ITU potions for the 2-3 times you'll need to cast the spell. Especially in the pre-30's clerics are really the ugly stepchild compared to shamans and druids. Yeah, that's beans to those of you powerlevelling and getting AAXP pts but it's significant to the clerics who went through all that. <br>
<br>
Something particularly cruel in my opinion is giving rez to the class least able to get safely from point A to point B. Rezzing is like porting -- neither of those abilities are going to get you a group. (Ok, actually there is Howling Stones to prove me wrong on the porting) At least not often.<br>
<br>
Clerics only casting Magic based DDs and spells also really sucks as someone who's played an enchanter. Be greatful for fire, cold and magic attacks, druids, and for the nearly unresistable magic stuff you have like the drones line of dots. And the fire debuffs.<br>
<br>
Honestly, druids rock in EQ for the daily getting around, killing stuff, etc.<br>
<br>
But clerics can heal. I mean really heal. Playing a cleric after levelling a druid to 53 still causes me to blink at how well they can heal, and I'm talking pre-Comp Heal. <br>
<br>
** And yes, Comp Heal was a really bad move on Verant's part, but it's also patently obvious that they didn't do any planning on post 50 levels and it seemed like a cute spell pre-Kunark. <br>
<br>
Pre high end AAXP soloing, a druid from 40something into 50's healing a group has either a huge challenge or a nearly impossible task. That's where it really turns ugly and it's frustrating to have your ability bottom out so abruptly at that point. <br>
<br>
Add to that frustation, that most guilds seem to have loads of druids, many of whom have a hard time getting groups and so piddle time away in lonely soloing. If you want to feel useless as a druid join a 50-something group with a ranger (snare), mage (ds) and cleric. Head to Velious and take on the big hp mobs to really feel the pain. That's all theoretical since getting into a group doesn't seem very likely short of having a really solid circle of friends.<br>
<br>
So, one lesson is that this debate depends upon where you stand. Might as well divide this up into newbie to mids, 40's &amp; 50's and the heavy AAXP grind levels. Because people are comparing apples and oranges by taking comments others make making about a different part of the game.<br>
<br>
I'm sympathetic to both sides. Clerics are trapped in that they've got a single strength and are panicky about losing it. Druids are victims of their own popularity (aka the legions of druid syndrome) and I think it's the number of druids out there that compound the lack of a strong raid ability and the lack of healing prowess. Guilds fill up quickly with druids. Clerics play time is a lot more monotonous, and travelling around indoors and outdoors is a hugely bigger headache than for druids.<br>
<br>
Of all the posts, the battle cleric with the standing=sitting mana regen ability sounds like one of the best ideas. Seems a bit too out of the box for Verant to implement though. I think both classes have valid complaints. I do think that clerics don't have a whole lot going for them though aside from healing -- and any proposals from druids to expand their class ability in improving healing is going to have to take that problem into account.<br>
<br>
I will say that I don't think druids appreciate how good they are at soloing relative to other classes. Significantly better than even mages in my opinion -- sow, snare and root usually mean survival in bad situations and effectiveness at soloing is as much if not more about avoiding death than simply killing stuff.<br>
<br>
Is that ability worth the lack of status in heavy raiding guilds and in raids? I don't know. I will say that I do sympathize with clerics feeling like druids want their cake and the ability to eat it too. The other two soloing casting classes in game, mages and necros, don't have much to do on raids either... it's just that there's far fewer of 'em.<br>

Ok, I've explained all of this to you before numerous times Islington.  Now I just have to tell you that you're an idiot.<br>

Druids do not do fine for healing.  EoD.  Not on raids, not in groups.  I refuse to explain it to you again for the 50th time in the past 3 months.<br>
<br>
BTW, in many high end guilds the Cleric<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ruid ratio is so disproportionate, that a group of clerics are set aside to do those fast little heals...because clerics do them faster and heal more with them.<br>
<br>
You know...I've never suggested Druids get CH, but the repeated onlsaught of ignorant Clerics coming here and tells Druids that we heal fine is making it easier and easier for me to think &quot;@#%$ clerics, give us CH&quot;.  You have DoTs now.  You have a myriad of ways you can enhance your run speed now.  You can port back to your home city now and with PoP you will be able to port from you home city to any other city.  You can solo, you can nuke, you can increase your mana regen, you can rez and your non CH heals are much better than ours, let alone your CH.<br>
<br>
What, exactly, do Druids have that Clerics don't? Invis and snare?  I'll give you invis and snare, you just give me CH.  Sounds fair to me. <br>

Let me, instead, ask you this:<br>

Why would anyone continue playing a Druid if we don't find our healing (at the least) upgraded to something necessary and useful?<br>

Why would anyone play a Druid if another class had the ability to port themselves about Norrath at whim without using a PC?<br>

<br>
Why would anyone play a Druid if we had to share our &quot;defining&quot; abilities with a hybrid class?<br>

<br>
I've witness clerics get nuking upgrades, the ability to DoT.  The ability, subsequently to those two, to solo.  I've witnessed them get a player made (i.e. not an uber item off an uber mob that only 10 clerics per server will get) self port back to their home city.  I've seen them benefit from purchasable J-boots (T-boots) and free Run 3 AAps at level 51.  They've received damage shields and the ability to stack PotC with Aego for themselves.<br>
<br>
I've watched every aspect of cleric healing improve in leaps and bounds, while they received all these other benefits.<br>
<br>
Sorry, your cries that Druids must pay for their versatility fall on deaf ears now.  Clerics are quite versatile.  Druids still heal with the basic effectiveness of a Cleric using Sup Heal.  In fact, a Cleric casting Sup Heal will have a better direct mana:healing ratio than a druid can ever reach.  Meanwhile, we can't even get a HoT spell.  <br>
<br>
Where is my CH stone?  My Rez potion?  My AA which will permit me to heal 1500 damage in 5 ticks?  Where's my upgraded healing ability?  <br>
<br>
Why the hell do Clerics believe the abilities and power should only flow one way? From the Druids to the Clerics?  @#%$ em.  Give me CH. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">Aidon</a>

First, a warrior and druid duo in fungus grove isn't the way to make good alt exp. It can be done, and it is fairly safe, but the exp is rather lacking. I can make twice the exp hunting in CT with a full group (cleric required) that I can make in FG duoing shrooms. On top of that, some killer loot drops in CT.<br>
<br>
Two, for you clerics who don't know how (or don't want to admit you know how), here is how you solo for exp. You go somewhere such as the grey. Of course you don't need sow because you have potions/jboots/horse/run3. You get one of the undead, you root it, and you dot it. Refresh root and dot as needed, and you should finish the mob near full mana with very low risk. For fun if you get bored, grab two. This doesn't give you much time to med, but you double your exp. Yes, it is boring, but it is one of the two wonderful ways that druids make solo exp because they can't get those nifty groups in CT (unless they bring a level 60 warrior along <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). The other way involves juggling four mobs, nuking them to death, and then medding while doing laundry or something else to pass the time.<br>
<br>
And for those that say that giving druids a less mana efficient form of CH would end clerics ever going on raids you are insane. Clerics would still be the prefered class for most CH rotations. The only time that might change is in a shorter fight were the ae was the worst thing and clerics have better regular heals and cures, or when a guild was short of clerics for the raid. And OMG heaven forbid that you would be able to pull off a raid with only four clerics where six used to be the bare minimum. What really gets me though is how a class can do nothing but complain about the CH rotation ball and chain but then is so opposed to the one solution that might actually get them out of it part of the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW, Im not real big on druids getting CH either. I just believe it is the ONLY way to balance healing and I don't understand the opposition from clerics on this if the druid CH cost 50-100% more mana to cast. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fyyrlustorm>FyyrLuStorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Small Pissed Off Diety<br>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333399>(7/10/02 1:11:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE</span><hr size=1> You should leave FG out of this discussion all together.<br>
