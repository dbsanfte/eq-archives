I read all the recent posts about how to do him and tried to set it up that way. Buffs were 4 junk buffs then the rest. I had the two main tanks in wolf form behind the dwarf, with all the other tanks behind them. The casters were at the tunnel entrance, none should have been sitting when I turned it in. There was NO time lag for him to spawn. I turned it in and headed back to the tunnel, when I got there I saw a flicker of Fay flash before me and he was in the middle mauling all the casters. He didn't even go near the tanks, they all had to run up to the tunnel. He was stuck in the wall and only a couple tanks could hit him. We backed him up and since aggro was all wierd, he started running ALL over the beach. It was horrible, we got him down to about 50 or so. The highest level guy we had was a 57 warrior who tagged along. My advice is to have the tanks closer to the ramp.<br>
<br>
He does NOT despawn after being left alone for 10 minutes. Several people died again trying to invis in. Training to the Erudites did not help. Finally a necro, mage, and wizard in my guild buffed MR, Regen, Sow, HP and ran in, aggroed him, and ran all around the top of the wall of the Oasis in circles until we had dragged everyone outside to the middle area. We did CR out here, a couple people left, we decided to try again. Meanwhile our necro is still in there running his ass off in circles while we re-make groups. Our highest levels were 56, you don't necessarily need 57+ tanks. When we were all buffed up and ready to go, the necro announced when he was about to come around to the tunnel. Tanks ran in and our necro headed on over with Fay on his tail. (by this time he was using jboots and getting nipped in the butt a bit) We fought him at the very North end of the beach with no problems with the Erudites. They didn't heal, they didn't fight, nothing. He ran up the wall all the way to the top before we finally got him!<br>
<br>
The KEY to this is Jboots, honestly. I play a 54 warrior too and at the end of the fight, had lost only 4 of my junk buffs. Have anyone who has it hotkey it. They don't need to jam it non-stop, we had like a hundred jboots messages in 10 seconds and it got laggy. Just be sure they watch when it runs out and hit the key again.<br>
<br>
The wizards and Mages wanted to go to Kedge and when I got there, *three* tainted seahorses were there. So I got mine and so did the other druid with us. :)<br>
<br>
I had been killing Jade Reavers for a good amount of time, we even did a couple shammy epics and still no jade reaver. I head to com and the second one drops it. So yes, they still exist. :D<br>
<br>
Tainted seafury was up when we got there, making it my last mob. I did all the little subquests and now have my cute little leaf flitty sword. Just thought I'd give my own feedback on tactics. I could never have done it without such a great guild! =)<br>
