Her fur coat provided much warmth, but even her little button nose was red from the numbing cold.<br>
The young wood elf was out for a bit of morning exploration. The skies above her still lazily hung in dawn, the sun a white frozen ball in the sky. There wasn't much to see this morning, and she was speeding along the terrain like a wisp out of hell. <br>
The wooden cabin her and her friends shared came into view. A small plume of blackened smoke rose from the hole in the roof, a sign that breakfast was in the making. <br>
<br>
A freezing draft of wind burst into the cabin as Llannu opened the door, but noone shuddered at the cold. Instead, the occupants remained sitting, or standing. <br>
Llannu pulled back the hood of her furry coat, and glanced around the room. There was a single log burning in the firepit, but no meal being cooked over it. Tanari, the oldest of the group, looked up with red eyes of sadness. <br>
In that moment, Llannu's heart welled up to her throaght, as she did not see one member of the group. <br>
Tilana, the large barbarian warrioress, stood firm against the wall, arms crossed over her chest, and her helmet pushed down just enough to cover her eyes.<br>
Daemonael sat on the mattress, her head buried in her arms. Silent sobs snuck out from her curly white locks of hair that draped over the wizard's head and arms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is she?&quot; Llannu asked weakly. Looking up at Tanari, who was now standing, she recieved her answer.<br>
&quot;Fenye.. has left us. She won't be coming back, sweety.&quot; Tears welled up in Tanari's eyes, and a knot rose up her throaght, preventing her from speaking further. Llannu's lips quavered for a moment, but after a moment the young bard ran into Tanari's arms, screaming of anguish and denial.<br>
<br>
The two held each other for what seemed like hours, before a knock at the cabin door finally separated the hazy illusion of sorrow from reality. Tilana calmly walked over and opened the door, revealing the cleric who was called for. <br>
&quot;Ma'am I'm sorry.. There is nothing I can do. Her soul will not reunite with her body. It is rare this happens, but when the soul longs for something for so long, and it's needs are not quenched, the soul can leave the body and never return. I'm sorry.. but I can't do anything.&quot;<br>
Tilana merely nodded and paid the cleric his dues, stepped outside, and shut the door quietly behind her.<br>
<br>
The winds were fierce now, but to the tall barbarian, who grew up in the cold lands of the Everfrost Mountains, these winds were no bother. Creepy shadows from a tree that the dawn's sun created stretched out across the yard to the cabin where she stood. At the base of this tree lay the body of one of the greatest heroes Felwithe had ever seen.<br>
Her feet crunched in the wind frozen snow as she made her way over to the sleeping champion.<br>
Her brilliant armor still shone with the majestic blue of a deep ocean, and her sword still gleamed as white as new fallen snow. The sword was clenched tightly in her gauntleted hands, the blade lay between her legs and driven into the snow, supporting the body into a sitting position. Her visor was shut, and only the long golden strands of hair was visible.<br>
A tear rolled off Tilana's cheek, but froze to the corner of her lip. The warrior looked down at her sleeping friend, and remembered all the times they had shared together in life.<br>
Before long, Tanari joined Tilana, with Llannu cradled in her arms, still stiffling a cry now and then. Daemonael strode in, as elegant as any Tier'Dal could be, even in her state of mourning.<br>
The four stood there, remembering times that Fenye had led them. The times that Fenye had grieved with them, and the times that Fenye had cheered them on. <br>
Llannu's face was still buried in Tanari's neck, unwanting to look at Fenye's body, so Tanari had to be strong for both of them.<br>
<br>
Almost as soon as they were ready to go back in and prepare to bury the body, Fenye's hand released the sword. As it fell, the blade kicked up a tiny bit of snow, landing with a ping as the hilt touched her legplate. The armor caved in a little bit, enough to get the attention of the four.<br>
<br>
Tilana stepped forward, lifting the visor, but gasped as thier was no longer a body inside the suit of armor. <br>
Tanari smiled, as the warm winds of the Faydarks passed over and through them, the soft whispers of the Mother soothing thier sadness. <br>
<br>
Kissing sleeping Llannu's forehead, Tanari said under her breath, &quot;I guess it was truely your time to go, my friend. We will all remember you in your greatest form, Fenye.&quot;<br>
<br>
With that, the four adventurers returned to thier cabin, to once again plan new and great adventures. The only sounds were the whispers in the winds, the sounds of a soul joyfully reuniting with the heavens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usvaboda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Svaboda</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/01 12:26:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.users.qwest.net/~tharper1/myweb4/svaface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Knight comes to rest</span><hr size=1> /cheer Fenye nice! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utanari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Chaos</span><br>  Posts: 499<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/21/01 7:15:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=250.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Knight comes to rest</span><hr size=1> /cry /cry /cry<br>
<br>
That was very nicely written Fenye, and even tho i cried , i thought it was beautiful.<br>
<br>
Tanari left the sleeping Llannu and the others and went out to take care of the funeral. She carried the armor and sword with compassion and grace. As she came to the musoleom, she pushed inside and carefully laid the armor out, making sure to position it properly. Laying Fenye's gleaming, magical sword over her chest and cupping it in her hands, she knelt over her long time companions helmet.<br>
<br>
Kissing the visor softly, she said her goodbyes to the person who meant so much to her, the one that showed her how to be strong and never give up. To never back down from any monster or foul creature.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you were tired of this world my love, and i will keep my promise to look after your little ones. But do not think you are alone. There are many in this world that will remember you as i do and your strength and shining example will fuel the desire of others to follow in your footsteps as i have.&quot; tanari whispered to her fallen companion.<br>
<br>
Rising from Fenye's helmet, she said will a strong voice and great vehemence, &quot;You were always strong and i tried to follow your example, but i always felt like i would never be your equal. You will not be alone or without me for long. The priests say they cant bring you back, but they dont carry the fires of love in their hearts as I do. I will not give up hope. I will find a way to be with you again, wether that is resurrecting you, or traveling to the planes and facing the gods, i will be with you again. If i have to, i'll make Cazic Thule beg on his hands and knees to give me the power to bring you back. And if i cant, then the sooner i will be with you in the afterlife.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bending down to give one last kiss to the armor that had so inspired her, she backed away toward the door to the crypt. Taking one of her magical daggers from her boot, Tanari sliced open her left palm. Mixing the blood in her hands, she began to speak words of power, as she spoke, the air seemed to shimmer and squirm. Tanari finished the incantation and let out a scream, and as she did, all of the sconces in the crypt burst to life with a fire more bright than any torch. Looking at them, Tanari knew they would never die out, just like the fires in her heart. <br>
<br>
Reaching into her pouch for some other components, she began another spell, this one far more powerful. Over the next few hours, she traced the magical runes all over the crypt, runes made with her own blood. And finishing the spell, she felt a small part of her soul leave her body and reside in the crypt itself. She knew that from this day forward, if anyone or anything tried to disturb her companions tomb, she would magically appear to defend it.<br>
<br>
Finally, opening the door, she turned back to the interior and faced the armor of her friend and teacher. &quot;I will miss you dearly Fenye. You were more than a friend, more than a teacher, you were the fire in my life, the fire that kept me warm during those cold nights, and the fire that kept me going in battle even after far better warriors had already fallen in combat. Til we meet again my love.&quot; Tanari took her huge sword off her back and raised it in salute to her friend. &quot;The world and the gods shall not forget you Fenye! I will make sure of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Closing the door to the crypt, she started back toward the cabin, but stopped halfway there. Looking back, a well of tears began to fall down her face. Then looking to the sky, she let loose a bellowing cry to the heavens, cursing the gods and all the powers that be. Letting them know that chaos will reign down on the world til she was reunited with her friend.<br>
<br>
Entering the cabin, she saw the looks upon all those within and the terrified look in Llannu's eyes. Tanari bent over the little bard and kissed her forehead. &quot;I must go on a long journey little one. There is something i must do. I will come by from time to time to make sure you are ok. If you need me for anything, send Ambridahl to find me, and i will return like lightning.&quot; Little Llannu looked up at Tanari and smiled..&quot;I know you will. You were always there with her.&quot; <br>
<br>
As Tanari put on her armor and gathered her things, Llannu couldnt stop the temptation to walk up behind Tanari and pinch her butt. With a yelp, Tanari turned around and looked at Llannu. The angry look on her face melted into a silly grin, and she smiled at Llannu. &quot;Thank you little one, i needed that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walking outside, she hugged everyone and waved goodbye. &quot;I'll return soon and tell you of my journeys. Be safe and look after each other.&quot; Kissing each one goodbye, she turned and began another spell. As her form changed into that of a great wolf, she ran into the distance, howling. Off in the distance, the other villagers could have sworn they heard the word Fenye floating along the breezes.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will miss you Fenye. <br>
<br>
Tanari BlazingVox<br>
Mistress of Chaos<br>
