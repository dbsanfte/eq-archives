My main being an enchanter and not playing a druid before, I find myself reading countless web sites and tactic guides these days. There seems to be a despairing lack of 25 to 29 level hunts for fast experience. What I am really looking for are solo or small group hunts. I am trying to catch some of my friend’s newer characters at the 35 to 34 levels. This means I really need fast experience. Anyone have some soloing suggestions for me? I am considering the wolly mammoths in permafrost for the tusks trade-in (up to 9pp each). <p><BR><BR><b>Quote:</b><BR>"What's th' goal of th' game, Mr. Toad? A monster slain? A maiden saved?

Mistmoore is great if you can find a group but not a place a druid wants to solo in IMO. SK was made for a druid to solo, I think.  I found a nice Tesch Mas Gnoll that spawned on a ledge by the spires. The time it took for my mana to regen and for him to respawn was a almost a perfect match.  If you go to SK just stay away from the Centaurs -damn arrows.<br>

Wait for your charm to break, and kill your pet. 3 blue to white kills on what should be less then 75% of your mana, med and repeat. One of the very best ways i have found to get fast steady experience. Just make sure you snare/root the first one right away incase charm breaks. Root/dotting 2 mobs wouldn't be that difficult anyways. Do it near the FM zone until you get the hang of it. You can use terroize animal if you get in trouble to give you some extra time to get to the zone if need be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udabbindabblefoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dabbin Dabblefoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/01 11:29:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solo advice 25-29 levels ?</span><hr size=1> Wow...a TREE! I never thought of that either :)<br>
<br>
/agree that South Karana is good at those levels, centaurs, aviaks and gnolls.<br>
<br>
Also, I loved Everfrost for lv. 25-30.  The mammoths are nice exp. and good cash.  Icy Orcs are also in Everfrost, a five spawn camp not far from the front entrance to permafrost.  Harmony works great on 'em.  Just avoid pulling Redwind (named one in the middle) because he opens with a 300 pt harmtouch.  There are 2 warriors and 2 casters.  I would stick to the warriors if soloing, just root and rot 'em.<br>
<br>
Ok LOIO can get crowded, but it is a large zone.  Group or pull singles to the hill above the FM zone line.  FM zone is there in case you get in trouble. LOIO good til 30.<br>
<br>
If you like static single spawns, go to East Karana and smack Broon around.  He spawns in canyon by HHP ramp, but if not killed wanders to river just south of druid ring.  Kill him in river the RUN (his big brother spwans and will wipe the floor with you if you do not leave river area) to the HHP ramp canyon.  Broon will spawn there every 6 minutes.  Just snare/root/DoT, repeat as needed.  <br>
<br>
When you are like 28 or so, just smack the giant skeletons around in Rathe Mountains near the Lake Rathe zone line (good to practice defense with these by thorning up and meleing). The lizards are on same spawn table, kill lizard men if you need to get more to spawn.  Just watch out for cyclops.<br>
<br>
I tried a lot of places those levels, we can travel, so take advantage of it :)<br>

I spent lvls 25-28 in LOIO and I absolutely hated it. I now know where all the immature people in East Commons have gone...to the Lake. It got so bad that I had to turn off shout and ooc channels because the constant stream across my screen gave me a headache. On the other hand, Everfrost has a great group of people playing there (at least on my server) ranging from newbie all the way to lvl 50+. I just loved the atmosphere.<br>
<br>
With a druid's tracking, you will have a definite advantage. I came back at lvl 29 to make some money for some new equipment and I'm still there halfway through lvl 32 (getting about 1/2 bubble of blue line exp on most kills at this lvl still). I bought a few relatively inexpensive dex items when I hit lvl 30 because I wanted to get my 1HB up (was languishing behind at skill lvl of 75). Start with snare, 1 combust, the 2 DOTs &amp; then fear him...run up and beat on him until he dies. I was able to get my 1HB maxed out before I got out of hell level and even got a few defense increases (was nearly maxed) when they broke fear. They don't hit really hard unless you try to go toe to toe with them...not a good idea.<br>
<br>
I kept 6 inventory slots open since the tusks won't fit in a backpack...averaged about 1 tusk per kill but got doubles many times. When I had my 5 or 6 I would port back to WC, make the short run to EC and sell to the first vendor I came to. They consider me amiably and, with a 98 Chr (nice that the dex equipment I got also had Chr increases) I was getting a little more than 10pp per tusk. Money really added up and I was able to get some pretty nice equipment upgrades (easily made 1200pp during hell lvl - can't do that in LOIO). To be honest, I never saw much difference, experience-wise, between the two zones. I've been having a ball...big game hunting at its best (at least at this level).<br>
<br>
If you need a little break from this, you could also solo the icy orcs or better yet group up with the many rangers who make their pilgramage here to visit Redwind. There's always mid to late 20's groups venturing into Permafrost too so that's also an option. When you get to about lvl 31 you can also hunt Martar Icebear (he's lvl 32) because everybody's KOS to him anyway (he wanders throughout the zone - once again tracking will help you). Just make sure that you're full mana and health...snare and nuke the heck out of him. I've gotten 3 cloaks of the icebear off him which sell really quickly in EC for 100pp...if needed you can run him to the guards and they'll kill him for you (used tracking to guide myself to the guards too - had to do that once). Another benefit is that at lvl 29 (for sure, maybe earlier) NOTHING aggros on you while you're running around the zone (although mammoths will help each other out). <br>
<br>
Whew, that was kinda long but I REALLY enjoyed hunting in this zone...so many different things to do. This place is perfect for all druids lvl 25-32...gonna hate leaving when I hit lvl 33.

When you need to med, you can rest on the various platforms located throughout the zone - nothing will aggro on you there. When I wasn't close to one of them I would just &quot;run up one of the zone walls&quot; and med there - never once was my meditation interrupted. Oh, yeah, I started to use levitate too when I hit lvl 31 (didn't think about it before), it will help you move more quickly since there are a couple frozen rivers in the zone and there are quite a few steep inclines throughout the zone. Probably heard this before but wouldn't suggest you go in wolf form since that makes you KOS to all the barbarians which kinda eliminates your ability to run to the guards and there's a couple of NPCs that run around the zone (Tundra Jack and his pet polar bear Iceberg) that will jump you if in wolf form. Although I talked to a lvl 24 druid a couple of days ago who said that if she's not in wolf form the orc shamans mess with her so it was a chance she chose to take...something to thing about until you get to your late 20's. <br>

Try it sometime, think you'll agree that running to the guards might not seem like too bad of an idea... ;) <br>
<br>
Like I said, not sure of when the orcs quit aggroing on you but just make sure you stay west of the eastern-most tract of land (the one with the icy orcs and Ice Giants) and you'll be fine...not nearly as many there.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utillil1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tillil 1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/10/01 4:55:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solo advice 25-29 levels ?</span><hr size=1> bump <p>Tillil Tillillit 26th Level Halfling Druid <BR> Raubbit   9th level Halfling Cleric  <BR>Locomoto  5th level human monk<BR> The Gnome Quads,- Gneme, Gnerd, Gnocci, and Gnough(deceased) <BR>Residents of Luclin</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unorpin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Norpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/12/01 10:15:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solo advice 25-29 levels ?</span><hr size=1> I've hunted in all the places mentioned so far and they are all good ones.  Two other good places for me were Unrest and Warsliks Woods.<br>
<br>
Unrest is good becuase with Wolfform and Harmony I get singles 99% of the time, and the loot is great with fine steel weapons, small ringmail and the occational small bronze being the norm for the mobs in that level range.<br>
<br>
WW was the place I spent most of my time.  There are several decent spots.  One is the giant fort.  At 25 (before even) you can solo Saplings and Greenwoods pretty easily and by 28 I could solo Evergreens consistantly with root/dot.  The giant weapons they drop sell very well to vendors, and there is the rare chance that you'll get a Forest Loop.<br>
<br>
Another good spot is the Sulking Brutes at the cave entrence to Dalnir.  There are 5 off them, they are non-aggro and won't assist, and there are no wandering mobs down there.  They are about as hard as Evergreens, but you don't have room to kite so it can be hard if you aren't used to root/dot or porcupining.  There also seemed to be less lag since you couldn't see the trees.  Loot is mostly coin and research materials, and the hides used in Halfling cultural tailoring.<br>
<br>
The last spot was the camp of the Iksar Bandit Lord.  There are 3 static spawn iksar at the ruins.  They can either be iksar parahas, iksar exiles, or the Iksar Bandit Lord, who drops the Bracer of Scavanging (everytime I think).  Parahs are as hard as Greenwoods and Exiles are hard as Sulking Brutes.  The Lord is a bit of an overcon, and isn't any harder than an exile except for resisting spells a bit more.  Other than the bracer, the loot is in general a little better than the brutes, but not as good as the giants.  This is the hardest spot of the three to hunt because there are a lot of wandering mobs around the area, mainly giants, iksar and goblins, who are nasty becuase some of them are casters. <p><hr>

I tried the Lake and didn't like it much. What I did that many other druids don't do much of is try to use the pet method. I'd try to charm a mammoth and set it on another. There's two ways you can do this. First you can treat you pet as your friend by buffing it, and helping kill the victim with a dot, nukes etc or you can choose to see the pet as expendable by letting it get very low on health and only helping a little and then invising (to break charm) and killing the pet. This way you kill 2 mobs with very little mana. Of course when playing with charmed pets it can all get very messy when the charm breaks at the most innoportune time but at least it adds a little fun and excitement! Mammoth tusks also sell for about 10pp - hint, stand in tree form at the Halas vendors and you'll get more cash.<br>
