</td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   A Memory.  &lt;Sorry, it's only Part I and yes, long&gt;</span><hr size=1> Autumn's chill breath sighed across the Destain's dark-robed body.  He stood before the ravaged desolation which had once been the arrogant spires and fortified walls of House D'Estain, while whirlwinds of fallen leaves danced innocently among the ruins.  The black iron gates of his family's house still held strong, still guarding the lone Tower which remained.  This Tower, the last remaining structure of the ancient Castle of his ancestors, was the Destain's private refuge and would remain so until the Walker called him to Her breast.<br>
<br>
&quot;Open, ye gates.  I have come home.&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighed and drew his robes closer to him as the iron gates shuddered and opened before him.  He walked between them and bid them shut with a sweeping gesture.  They silently closed behind him.<br>
<br>
Reaching into the folds of his flowing garments he drew forth a small key.  He placed it into the iron door's lock, turned it, and stepped inside.<br>
<br>
He climbed the granite flights of his Tower.  He felt the stone welcome him, quaking with contentment under each step of his black, blighted boots.  The very rock was imbued with the dead, his fallen family.  And they had fallen under his command, so long ago.<br>
<br>
He staggered upon the stairway, caught under the weight of the memories his home always brought to him upon a long absence.  The Destain slumped to the steps, and let the visions come.  They had a right to be remembered.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
He was very young then.  The black granite and twisted metal of his ancestral home was under siege by his own people, for heresy against the Father.<br>
<br>
It was politics.  He had known that even in his youth.  The High Council, under King Nythox Thex, had decreed his family to be heretics.  His family was viciously loyal to the Father, but even moreso their allegiance was to the Lodge of the Dead and to Christanos Thex, Nythox's willful Queen.  His family was subversive to the King's designs, and while he could not have cared less for the ways of the Court he too was condemned under Nythox's decree.<br>
<br>
The ramparts were patrolled by shadows and the living dead, called forth from the Deadlands by his father's art and the will of Innoruuk. It was a horrid sight to see them shambling in the twilight, soundless but heard, intangible but felt as a chill in the heart of those who neared them.  The very air crackled with numbing cold which far exceeded the season.  When the knights of Nythox Thex stormed the gates there would be such a battle that the ground itself would shrink away from the virulence of the blood shed there.<br>
<br>
Humwawa sat in his Tower, his rightful dwelling place as First Son of the House, and prepared his escape.  His father was a cold and hateful man, and a man strongly under the Father's favor.  Lord D'Estain had demanded the House stay within the halls of the estate instead of flee, wishing instead that his family die under the rage of Innoruuk rather than place themselves under self-imposed exile, as Nythox wished.  Humwawa struggled with the words his tutors had taught him, which would allow him to use the shadows as gate to step through to safety.  His teeth chattered too much from the cold.<br>
<br>
The candle in his room went out, and the darkness set in.  Nythox's men were raising their blades against the guardians of his home, and the king's bonecallers were filling his home with darkness and smoke.  There would be no escape.Outside he heard the screams of men whose hearts had been turned to ice by the touch of the grave.  He heard the unnatural wailing of a risen monstrosity returning to the grave, guided there by teir'dal steel.  And still the darkness grew blacker, the cold more unbearable.  It was time to escape another way. He drew his cloak around his body and from his desk he drew his dagger.  Reaching to his neck he drew away the black collar which guarded his throat and showed his allegiance to House D'Estain.  He drew the blade to his bared throat.<br>
<br>
There was a fierce howling -- a death cry.  The house shook violently upon its foundations as Humwawa's father was stricken dead upon the field outside.  The dagger slipped from the young man's hand as he fell to the hard floor.  His family had lost the battle, and the horrors which would be inflicted upon the living and the fallen would disgrace the D'Estain name for all time.  Humwawa started to cry.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does the Destain cry so?&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned around.  The shadows twisted from their places in his room, contorted from their places in nature and spun, a maelstrom of darkness.  They converged and spun in a breathless image of a black rosebloom before his tear-stricken eyes.  The shadow rose bloomed before him, and the bloom was a woman.  Her skin had the brilliance of metal furnace-blasted to bright luminescence, her hair a sea of darkness, stars glittering within raven curls.  Eyes the hue of the pale morning sky sparkled above high cheekbones, full lips glistening like oil enthroned between her hollow cheeks.  The rose became her rainments, the petals clinging to her form fanatically yet unable to hide the fierce brilliance of her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please do not cry, child, I implore ye..,&quot; her voice crashed upon his spirit in waves, sculpting a new courage for him within his breast.  The screams of the King's troops and the cries of his own family grew dim in his ears -- he was in the prescence of true royalty.<br>
<br>
He rose to his knees before her.  &quot;Mistress, who do I humble myself before?&quot; he breathed quietly to her, enraptured.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am your father's enemy, his Lord's nemesis.  I am Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young man restrained a gasp.  &quot;You cannot be..I have seen your likeness in koada'dal manuscripts..you..are far from her likeness..&quot;<br>
<br>
When she smiled his whole body shook with rapture.  &quot;Indeed, I am the Mother of All, my child..the Protector of the Faydark.  Understand that there is duality in all things, sweet child.  In the heart of the koada'dal there can be found a hatred that would blister the souls of the priests of Innoruuk...and in the tier'dal spirit there can be found almost limitless compassion.  Mortals are not the exception to this..even the gods are bound to it.  Even the Mother of All walks in violet twilight...it is balance, child.&quot;<br>
<br>
She rose up, black and terrible before him.  In the Chapel of Innoruuk Destain had felt the Father, and his unfathomable rage.  Before her he felt only Death, pure and merciful in its swiftness of action.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are Priest to me, Destain.  Even as I bring forth children, I also take them back to my breast.  The followers of the Mother shall hate you, my son -- but know that I favour you above all my children.  You shall exact my will over the living of all the world.  You shall cut the threads of life at my command.  And as my will is yours, yours is also mine.  So is the relationship between Mother and son, Divine and mortal.&quot;<br>
<br>
She offered her brilliant hand to him.  Without hesitation, he took it.<br>
<br>
The Walker of the Violet Twilight smiled upon him. &quot;I have heard your silent prayer.  So be it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The world exploded in brilliant white light.  The agonies of his fallen kin were cut short in a holocaust of the Walker's will.  When the light faded, the Destain stood alone, the Tower which had been his residence for sixteen years the only remnant of House D'Estain, and he the only living being in many wheels.  The armies were torn asunder by his goddess, and his family spared the torture of unlife at the hands of Nythox Thex by Her glorious annhilation.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Destain rose up from the steps upon which he had swooned.  It was time to rest.<br>
<br>
He staggered up the remaining flights of stairs, to his private chambers.  He slumped to the bed, and fell asleep.<br>
<br>
The Destain dreamed....<br>
