Sure, there are many people that do not use them properly but there are times that an AoE is not only useful but needed in a battle. The lower the level group, the more needed they are. I have a Wizard alt. <br>
<br>
 LET THE WARS BEGIN!<br>
<br>
First, let us look at the differant AoE's.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Rain Spells: </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Low agro, decent damage over an area over two or threes rounds. A wizard's Rain Spells have a tighter range than the druid's spells. This breaks mez and makes it impossible to mez for several rounds. Use with enchanter in group is if enchanter is OOM or tanks are refusing to assist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u> DD AoE's: </u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> High Agro but this is where a wizard really shines. This one is the one I will talk most about. Three of these puppies and even trains are wiped to cinders. The radius of these spells are fairly small and with careful targeting can hit two or three mobs leaving several others untouched. Uses are as follows. Tanks not assisting. Heavy pop or train that is resisting enchanter's AoE mez and has to be brought down quickly. <br>
<br>
 The heavy agro caused by these spells means any unengaged MoBs will come for the Wizard. A wizard needs Shield Skin on (&quot;You magical skin absorbs the blow&quot;) and Root and Shadow Step up. Extra MoBs are then rooted. First the wizard targets an unengaged MoB to let loose the spell after rooting another one in place to start with. He let's loosse the AoE. The MoBs (only two or three only, hopefully) charge the Wizard. Wizard roots. If after two tries roots are continued to be interupted Wizard Shadow Steps and Roots. Wizard then moves away from Rooted MoB and engaged tanks and casters. Root and repeat until all extra Mobs are scattered around the combat area. Enchanter follows and single target Mezz's the rooted MoBs. Wizard hopefully takes no more than half his HP in damage. Wizard says nothing about &quot;heal me&quot; to the cleric. Wizard re-AoE's the MoBs in the tank area, killing two to four. Now the un-assisting tanks can see single targets and are more likely to assist. This works extreamly well at lower levels with tanks that are not used to working with Enchanters. Sometimes it is prudent to start this action with a Rain Spell. <br>
<br>
Some one else lets loose a Rain Spell. Mez is already broken. The good Wizard cuts loose with two Rain Spells and then the AoE DD. Result is the Enchanter gets pissed at the Wizard (when it was the Druid that started it) but she sits and meds as the MoBs turn to smoking heaps. This is undesirable but the Enchanter has to watch and see who began breaking the mezzes to begin with. All the good Wizard is doing is assessing the situation and draining his mana for the safety of the party. Here are some clues to help the Enchanter properly assess the situation. Is there a wide area Rain Spell initually dropping? If there is, look at the Druid. When the first Rain Spell is dropped, who does the extra MoBs agro to first? Since the good Wizard is doing a follow up Rain Spell, the initual damage is done and agro list put into place by the bad caster 80% of the time or better.<br>
<br>
The final use of an AoE DD is when the tanks are assisting properly and there are only two MoBs in the radius of the AoE (remember, this is a tight radius) or if the the tanks are not assisting and there is only one mezzed MoB in the AoE's radius. The good Wizard watches the engaged MoB's hit points and determains when it is down to the point where the AoE will finish off the engaged MoB(s). Now, the good Wizard targets a MoB or party member on the side of engagement away from mezzed MoBs that he wants to keep mezzed. He lets loose the DD AoE. Engaged MoB(s) fly away from the center of the AoE into lootable piles as the Mezzed MoB in activated. The activated MoB then has to be immeadiatly engaged by the tanks. Wizard needs to Root the agroed MoB, if needed, and step away. Remember, a good Wizard's job is to do as much heavy damage to a MoB as possible with out getting agroed too much. In heavy pop or fast pull situations, a Wizard's mana rarely allows more than one nuke per MoB. Using the AoE kill/activate adds 50-80% more damage delt out to the activated MoB than is otherwise possible. This makes Enchanters nervious, especially if an unwanted mezzed MoB is in the AoE's radius. In this case, the halfway good wizard roots the MoB and steps back, as he did above, spreading the mistargets out. The Enchanter remezz's as the Wizard apoligizes for misestimating the AoE's radius.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as Necro AoE DoTs are concerned, the only reason they should ever be used with an enchanter in the group is for the same reason that the Wizard needs to cut loose with AoE's. I.e.: someone else in the party is already making the Enchanter's job impossable and it is a follow up to that situation or the Enchanter is OOM. Even here, if the Wizard is a good Wizard and knows how to spread out the MoB's, an AoE DoT should NOT be used as the Enchater will follow up with single target Mez's. The DoT'er needs to be extra careful to make sure he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> targets the MoBs that the tanks are engaging with single target DoTs, under normal circumstances. <br>
<br>
AoE's do have a place in the game and they do have a place in a group with Enchanters. The good Wizard will use them sparingly and with extream caution. In a group where others are breaking Mez's, a good Wizard will use them much more often and with little to no delay to save the party's butts.<br>
<br>
I have been grouped with my RL GF's Enchanter alt since 4th level. I have had alot of practice sizing up situations and reacting accordingly. My timing is pretty darn good, too. <br>
<br>
If more Enchanters would watch more and not just jump all over Wizards everytime an AoE is released (even if the initual AoE was not the good Wizard's AoE, he still gets the blame), then maybe this anomosity between these two classes could end and both classes could shine.<br>
<br>
 LET THE WAR END!<br>

Let me give you a reason why enchanters hate seeing AE spells in normal grouping and then ou can come to your conclusions as to why it's seen as a bad thing to do in normal grouping from a day to day basis.<br>
<br>
Seb -- Enchanter messes everything, cleric is at 50% mana, normal group with a wizard, mage, war, wiz, druid, enchanter, two targets are mezed and an extra walks up and there's something that is alomst dead in camp.  Wizard proceeds to AE the area, everything agros that was mezed on the enchanter (2 targets), the unengaged mob agros on the wizard the almost dead target dies.  Wizard starts to get the crap beat out of him, enchanter comes to a sliver of life before everything can be stunned and remezed.  Cleric is now oom, enchanter has been almost cut to ribbons and the wizard is happy because he got to use his AE spell to &quot;help&quot; in killing everything very mana efficiently.  Mind you there are still two mobs mezed and one is being fought.<br>
<br>
This was obviously not the place to use an AE rain, undoubtedly you are going to point out that the wizard was stupid in using it in this case...but that there is my point, there are a lot of stupid people on this server that have no idea what the hell is going on.  An enchanter is forced into saying no to most AE damage spells in close dungeons for that simple fact, people are too stupid to realize the big picture in most cases.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that everyone gets a red light to AE spell, I just don't trust people that I have grouped with for seldomly and are unpredicatable in my eyes.  This is not to say that we don't trust you, it's just that some people don't play well with enchanters, regardless if you've been grouped with your best friend's cousin's sister.  The last thing an enchanter wants to do when grouping for xp is die, it defeats the purpose. <p>Dauros 55th Enchanter of Ethos<BR>

<br>
A couple of points...<br>
<br>
1. Chanters usually don't get low on mana, unless they're performing double duty for a group. For example, if they're slowing AND hasting AND mezzing. (If they're low on mana outside of these situations, I wouldn't play with that enchanter.)<br>
<br>
2. I don't care what you do, as long as you don't break my mez.<br>

<br>
I HATE AE Nukes WHEN I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THEM.<br>
<br>
Understand here:  Enchanters have 8 spell slots just like everyone else.  If I am working in a standard party, I have Mez, Tash, Boon of the Garou, Theft of Thought, a Root, Clarity 2, and Aanya's up.  And a Memblur if I need it.  Maybe a Slow in there too depending.<br>
<br>
If we are EXPECTING the use of AE, I make room for 3 different Color Stuns, and usually RUNE.  It is a totally different spell setup.<br>
<br>
If someone goes around AE blasting without LETTING ME KNOW then I become utterly useless and usually dead.  If you tell me ahead of time I can change my setup and we can party down.<br>
<br>
That's why Enchanters get pissed.  Sitting down to swap out 4 spells with 12 MOBs on the party is horribly inconvenient.  Especially when 11 of them are aggroed on ME because a Mez was broken.<br>
<br>
Also, you need to consider the party makeup and the local MOBS before going AE.<br>
<br>
I love good AE groups.  I hate a Wizzy or Dr00d who decides to Supernova or Earthquake with no warning when there are 4 Mezzed MOBS in camp.  Understand the distinction?<br>

<br>
Dauros, by your own words you are biased against Wizards:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    &quot;people are too stupid to realize the big picture in most cases.&quot; ....&quot;I just don't trust people that I have grouped with for seldomly and are unpredicatable in my eyes.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Give the poor Nuker a chance to do his job. By the above quotes, I do not believe you do so. I cannot see you at your level telling a new tank to your group to &quot;please make an assist hotkey to target &lt;main puller&gt;.&quot; However, I can see you climbing all over a Wizard that AoE's, even if it is a good one by saying &quot;No more AoE's or I leave!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    &quot;Enchanter messes everything&quot;...&quot;everything agros that was mezed on the enchanter&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Wizard uses a DD AoE. This should do between 15-30% damage to all the MoBs. This really pisses off the MoBs. The MoBs agro the Wizard, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the Enchanter. Only reason a MoB would agro the enchanter is if it resisted the Nuke. This is also why the Wizard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have his &quot;Magic Skin&quot; on and Root memmed. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    &quot;an extra walks up&quot; &amp; &quot;This was obviously not the place to use an AE rain&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This argument is known as &quot;The Strawman Argument&quot; and the person that coined that term would not even answer such an autrocity. I will, however. <br>
<br>
First, the spell to kill one MoB and activate the second is a DD AoE, as I had stated, but perhaps not clearly enough for you. This makes your second quote moot, null <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> devoid of any meaning.<br>
<br>
Second, being in a group means you are going into a dangerious area where things can go wrong. &quot;an extra walks up&quot; is just such an &quot;Oh, $4it!&quot; situation. But, if such happens while the Wizard is casting his AoE, then there is no way in the Plane of Chaos that an Enchanter is going to stand up, target a new MoB, and Mez it before the DD AoE goes off. Again, you presented an arguement with no merit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    &quot;The last thing an enchanter wants to do when grouping for xp is die, it defeats the purpose.&quot; &amp; &quot;Cleric is now oom&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The assumption here is the good Wizard does not care if people die. Again, this shows your anti-Wizard bias. The Wizard's job is to do serious damage to MoBs so they die quickly. This means the MoBs have less time to do damage to the tanks. Less damage to tanks = less heals = less downtime for the Cleric = faster pulls = better Exp.<br>
<br>
I would like to end this response with the quote it began on:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    &quot;people are too stupid to realize the big picture in most cases.&quot; ....&quot;I just don't trust people that I have grouped with for seldomly and are unpredicatable in my eyes.&quot; &amp; &quot;The last thing an enchanter wants to do when grouping for xp is die, it defeats the purpose.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If this is the cases that you have run into in your groupings, then maybe you are grouping with the wrong people. Or, you are just Anti-Wizard biased. <br>

But regretably i often am told it is never the time for AE's if a chanter is in the group. I will take Dauros's post for an example. In the group makeup that you gave &quot;normal group with a wizard, mage, war, wiz, druid, enchanter&quot; (even presuming you typoed the cleric as a wiz) that would make a group with a wizard, mage, war, cleric, druid, enchanter. Now, this group has everything needed for the &quot;AE group Tactics&quot; a wiz, a mage, a druid for AE damage, cleric for heals and possibly AE (if things go well), chanter for AE stun and war for pulling and runners. Now taking the fact that this is a fairly good makeup for AE, you still state this should be a single kill group. Why?? this group would work better as AE. I will agree that rain is not the AE of choice in dungeons.<br>
<br>
That is what i see to be the largest problem with AE vs chanters. no-one is willing to accept when AE may be better then mez and single kill because we we're all raised and conditioned into believing AE is BAD. There is a time and place for everything, and i believe that, depending on the cituation, it should not always be the wizards, mages and druids that must bend to the will of the enchanter. Now, i will agree that all members involved must be prepared for these tactics, and in that they must therefor all agree to do it, and since only 2 enchanters i've ever met have been willing to, and most threaten to leave (i even had one threaten to leave if i even mentioned it a second time), i have never had the chance to use AE group tactics. I do however use AE's regularly when there is no chanter or mezzer in group. <p>Tatrianna Highblood<br>

However, I almost always keep a shield and a one hander in my EE bag. When I am encountering casters regulairly, my Nath Greatsword (was the Runic Carver) goes into the EE Bag and out comes the shield and one hander. Why? Because my bash can interupt a caster. <br>
<br>
 I also have two spell slots (as a palli) that I will change out as I go from zone to zone. Sometimes I need cancil magic, other times I need to nuke undead. Sometimes I need invigor up (alot more now I have a Nath Greatsword and FBSS). <br>
<br>
Lesson here is differant situations call for differant tactics. I see Enchanters as refusing, as a class (with noted exceptions, of course), of learning to be versatile and practicing differant tactics for differant situations. This mearly hampers all the others in the group. The faster the MoBs go down, the less mana is spent on mezzing, healing, invigoring, nuking, DoTing and, on a loot &amp; exp over time ratio, on buffing.<br>
<br>
By refusing to learn how to fit into an AoE battle, the Enchanter is not only doing a disservice to their class but to the group as a whole. <br>
<br>
Me, as a tank, all I can do is try to keep the MoBs off the casters and make sure none run away to bring back a train of buddies. I can only trust that the cleric has suffenciant mana to keep me alive. I can hope that the casters make the encounters as short as possible so we can get our loot and exp and move on to the next MoB. Personally, I let the casters do their thing. Only time I get grumpy is if the Healer Nukes or a caster gets agroed and expects me to try in all futality to taunt the MoB off of him while running around like a headless chicken.<br>
<br>
Playing my Wizard alt, however, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I am a caster</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> . As a Wizard I am the ultimate damage machine. As a low level (19 now) grouped with a simulair level Enchanter that does not yet have all those neat group stuns I have heard about on this thread, I place my AoE's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  extreamly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> carefully. Depending on the situation, I may use only one or no AoE's in an encounter, but if things break down I will not hesitate to cut loose with them. End result is I go OOM and the enchater sits there wondering wtf just fell in to the fray to cause the heaps of MoB corpses everywhere. Party lives. So, I sit out the next round medding.<br>
<br>
Being grouped predominately with the same Enchanter for this many levels, she expects such from me at times. She also knows that such a thundrious mana drain on my part is almost always in reaction to someone or something else breaking down her Mez cycle. We look for where the breakdown begin and try to educate the lower levels how to work with an Enchanter.<br>
<br>
 However, anytime I have grouped with another Enchanter and the Mez cycle starts to get broke down and I react quickly and decisivally to that situation with a sortie of AoE's, the blame for the broken cycle is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> leveled on me, the Wizard. I then spend the next 20 min or so telling the Enchanter to watch and see who broke the Mez cycle to begin with.<br>
<br>
 I empathize with the Enchanter's mission of controlling the crowd and keeping the party alive, but that does not mean that the Enchanter should point the blame for a break down in the mezz's at the Wizard or any other class with out first making sure that that is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  cause</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the breakdown and not a swift reaction to it. In my experiances, this is always the case, however.<br>
<br>
 This is why I say Enchanters are Anti-Wizard biased.<br>
<br>
 The information about group stuns I have garnered from this thread have also given me the idea that Enchanters at higher levels are also unfoundedly Anti-AoE biased, a bias that stems from the Enchanter refusing to learn new ways of dealing with situations based from their refusal to learn how to properly use ALL their spells.<br>

<br>
Druids and chanters actually serve best to keep the mobs stuck in the wizards field of fiery death with the AE stuns, and AE root (plus 190dd) and AE snare. <br>
<br>
But like was said above everyone should be told and know its an AE group so different spells can be loaded by everyone.  If we are just gonna use AE by the wizard to seperate the mobs so the enchanter can mez them, I would much rather leave them on the tank to be mezzed 1 at a time and have the wizard with his pittance of life not be put to the test, where he can use that time to more efficiently kill the mobs the group is working on.<br>

Being a wizard at an upper level is way way different than playing a wizard a lower one (19 in this case). First of all, at upper levels, root doesn't work, period. The second that rooted mob is touched the root breaks and it's coming after you again. Furthermore, at level 55 I have around 1200 hp self buffed with a shield of the magi, Mobs that i'm fighting generally double or quad for over 100 right? If i'm expected to take less than half damage hopefully against 3 mobs (who for argument will just double hit, not quad) will hit me for 200 (two hits of 100+) each, 200 x 3 = 600, half my Hp right there instantly when they come up to me. Now I'm stunned, there's no way i'm getting off a shadow step (and in a dungeon, i'd hit a wall or cliff anyway (karnors water, sebilis ravines etc) so that doesn't help. This either means i'm dead, or I waste lots of cleric and enchanter mana, it might be mana efficient for me, but group efficiency is way way down. <br>
<br>
The only time that I feel that AoE's can work is either in a specific AoE group (which I do all the time with a cleric, enchanter, 3 (53+ wizards), and another AE class or puller if the wizards have enough power to do it. Or when there are only 2 mobs, and one of them is a cast from death. Even at this point it's risky, if I have 1200 hp, and the mob doubles for 100, the tanks have 6 rounds to clear off the mob (not counting kicks and bashes etc) which is usually very simple, adding a root in there kills you if you've nuked already as well. The only time that AoE is useful in general is at the lower levels, when no one assists anyway, AE groups, clearing low level areas when you're bored, and when you're suicidal. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Wizard uses a DD AoE. This should do between 15-30% damage to all the MoBs. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Starting at level 53 a wizard's DD AE will do 495 to each target until they get their next one (not for a long time), if this is 15% to 30% of a mobs life where i'm fighting, you're saying I could kill something like...a drolvarg captain in 2 ice comets and almost any other nuke.<br>
<br>
AE might work back at lower levels, but playing a wizard post 50 AE without a lot of prep is going to get you killed fast.<br>

I think much of what Dauros has stated is in line with the anti-AE mentality most enchanters i have met have shown me. However i will agree with you that AE's in the low vs high lvls are very much different. But, I regularly use AE's in groups when there is no enchanter, and because i learnt how to use them in the low lvls when the risks weren't so high, i rarely die due to using them now.<br>
<br>
As far as your &quot;specific&quot; AE group, i must say you are again close minded. There are many class's that can AE effectivly, i have even known AE groups that didn't use any wizards at all. I will say that this is one area that Wizards do excel in and are undoubtedly the best at, but we aren't the sole required AEers, let alone 3. Any 3 AEers will do. The only class that is needed is chanter. Cleric i'm not sure about, they don't use CH anyways, but i'm not sure if they do use heals the secondary healers don't get i.e. dot heals. or if they use there sup heal (which the secondaries do get) so i can't confirm or deny the need for clerics, just that they are the desired healer <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrinklith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brinklith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/1/01 3:43:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.aelf.net/pics/brink-now.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AoE's Druids, Wizards vs. Enchanters</span><hr size=1> I speak as someone whose girlfriend plays a post-50 Enchanter, and as someone who regularly takes over from her for long or short periods of time. My main is also a Bard, and maybe our experiences are similar:<br>
<br>
I'm sure you'll quote the numbers at me, but I'm sure that the traditional single assisted target approach is more controlled and mana-efficient: you concentrate all your efforts on one target and drop that quickly. The tanks can usually taunt the mob enough to keep handwavers' spells from being interrupted, and the Cleric only has one or two health bars to watch to keep the group alive.<br>
<br>
An AE attack seems to be more of a glorified free-for-all, where the poor healer has to look at everyone at once and (given the speed that a 50+ mob can deal out a full bar of damage to a handwaver) I reckon his job is much harder. AE stuns from the Chanter may help, but the recast time on those is so long that someone will be pummelled before another can be cast. If that someone is a caster, they will waste mana on interrupted spells.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with AE spells and songs in a group where we have no chanter (since I'm normally charming one, and any more can take as much damage as we can dish out), but since the Chanter's job is mainly crowd control you should default to their wishes. If the mez breaks I have yet to see a Chanter NOT get on the receiving end of a beating.  It's also not that common to see a (non-raid) group with both a Shaman and an Enchanter, so you can consider a Chanter's mana to be split between buffing, debuffing and crowd control 90% of the time. Lack of communication between an AE-loving nuker and a mezzing crowd controller will waste the latter's mana and result in their death more times than not. <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - The Jester of Avalon<br>

<br>
Brinklith, it is true that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> one</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> stun spell would not recycle in time to keep a mob planted. I do play a Paliden and we do get stuns. In a few levels I get another stun. As it is, if there are three Pallies fighting togather, we can chain stun a MoB and the poor fellow can not get anything off. It just sits there and dies. Now, the three stuns mentioned above from Eidolon are all AoE stuns. Cycling through three different stuns would keep all MoBs incapacitated during the battle.<br>
<br>
Again, both you and your girlfriend are thinking one deminsionally in a 3D world. Knowing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one's spells and abilities and using them as the situation dictates makes  player truely Uber. Refusing to learn and to use all that one has at their disposile and thereby limiting all others by your own limitations does a disservice not only to yourself but to all members in the group.<br>
<br>
When an Enchanter is chain stunning, they may very well go LoM by the end of battle. But a Wizard will go LoM rather or not AoE's are used. By chain stunning, the tank(s) hardly get touched, meaning that the Cleric has Mana now to deal out nukes of his own (albeit, very conservatively). <br>
<br>
Saterday my Wizard Alt worked on getting his 20th level at High Pass. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> At this level Enchanters do not have AoE stuns.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> There was a Bard that ran through the Pass while we were in combat. He decided that playing an AoE DoT would help us out as we had a half dozen MoBs up. This broke the Mezzes and the Enchanter died extreamly quickly as three MoBs jumped on her. The Druid and I immeadiatly opened up with a barrage of AoE's. What was a situation where the entire party was at risk was reduced to a situation where 2 or three heals from the Cleric was all that was needed to get our group through the situation.<br>
<br>
Now, if the Enchanter was able to chain stun the MoBs, like at higher levels, no MoBs would have been Mezzed from Jump Street and the stupid Bard's DoT would have changed nothing at all. We would have been using AoE's from the word go and as the MoBs would have been chain stunned none could have have agroed anyone, so the Cleric would not have needed to heal anyone. <br>
<br>
I fully agree that there are differances between lower and higher levels. The differances being that at higher levels the spell choices and combat abilities are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> compatable <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> increasing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> peoples' options in combat and group make ups, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> limiting them.<br>
<br>
I know the standard belief is in opposition to the above statement, but that is only due to one deminsional thinking.<br>

The bard was an idiot, and ruined what was an ordered fight, costing the life of the Enchanter, leading to downtime for the group and more exp lost for the Enchanter. Sure, AE has its place when there is no Enchanter, but I am sure things are far smoother when you take one at a time.<br>
<br>
In an AE fight:<br>
<br>
- who regulates the AE stuns? Stunning a mob that's already stunned is a waste of mana.<br>
<br>
- who snares what mob? More mobs to fight=more possible runners or gaters. More runners and gaters leads to trains and general chaos across the zone.<br>
<br>
- who taunts the mob that isn't stunned? Stun gets resisted, mob goes after enchanter (or other stunner, first attack on it) who now can't get any more AE stuns off: result, a large number of aggroed mobs unstunned.<br>
<br>
- even after /serverfilter, what happens to the players on lower-spec PCs at 56k when there's an AE fight going on? More hits, more animations, more damage shields, more particle effects: more lag and LDs.<br>
<br>
- While the group is resting between these colourful epic battles, what happens if a wanderer comes by while you're all licking your wounds?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if you like burning all your mana into a single mob (you're the first wiz I've heard complain of running out of mana on single pulls: most have learnt to save their mana). For me, a single mob at a time drops each faster for less health lost (ie: less mana burnt by EVERYBODY in the group). Recently, with a monk pulling, a chanter on crowd control and a bard (me) buffing and mana-singing, NONE of the group was ever low on mana, with constant single pulls (plus the occasional wanderer) and the cleric AND chanter meleeing for fun as well. When I say constant I mean constant as well: the monk was looking for more while we were finishing off the last one. That's low mana use and an efficient group.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm enjoying the discussion, and I'm sure there are places where AE fighting works better. I am a stong advocate of communication, and if the group's Chanter knows what is intended (and agrees to it), this should be fine.<br>
<br>
Just a final point: try not to make this personal, Krungle. Please don't call my playing style one-dimensional. As a bard main I play more roles in a group in one hour than any other class in the game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - The Jester of Avalon<br>

<br>
Well, for starters I'm actually unsure as to who is this single minded game player. Noted that you, Krungle as your Wizard, have grouped with other Enchanters, it seems from what you have been saying, that you have spent most of the playing time with only one Enchanter (your g/f). Now I see many pros and cons to this. Firstly it's very easy to get into a routine playing this way. You both know how to  communicate (practically without saying anything) so it's much easier to change tactics or play in a different style. However, this obviously makes it harder for you to change game tactics when playing with other Enchanters.<br>
<br>
I actually like having variety when grouping. I'm all for trying out new tactics, and at your Wizard's level this is a good time to do this. Over time, though, everyone notices how their strengths and weaknesses become advantageous or not, so they progress into what is your idea of a singular game play style. Ultimately this is by far the best way to go when you get to the 50+ level of game play where people have absolute specific roles. Yes, at times we can change those styles, group tactics, etc, depending on the circumstance, and it works if the people involved are normal intelligent folks. I for one am forever swopping spells when the group changes etc. This is a great test of ability, which in turn keeps the enjoyment factor up.<br>
<br>
At mid levels I liked to group with other Enchanters to see how they worked: pick up tips, good training for raids and general higher lvl playing. However, some of them really irritated me as they just would not change their spells and therefore their tactics depending on the circumstance. It all depends on whether the group is working efficiently. Thinking honestly here, I do think it is wise to stick to what you know best, first off, then once each of the group members has come to understand how the others work, that's when you can start experimenting. Though it is utterly beneficial to the group that everyone knows the plan.<br>
<br>
I have no prejudices against any class, we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ALL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have our jobs to do in the group. Yes, there have been times when I have got etremely annoyed with member(s) of the group for one reason or another but those were really bad situations, beleive me! In general if something or someone breaks the mez then I usually know exactly what/who it was as I have to have my eye on everything that's going on, I wouldn't be doing my job properly otherwise. Even if I say &quot;Something is breaking the mez!&quot; etc. (&lt;-- which is a tiny hint to those concerned), it still means I have a fair idea of what is happening. If I think something untoward is going on then I keep close watch through a few pulls to see, then either adjust to this, or have a quiet word with those concerned depending on what the problem is. In most circumstances if a mez gets broken, I just try doing it again. These things happen, I expect it to happen. Many times I switch to AoEs as people have split targets or something like that. It's fun but it is much more efficient for the entire group if we spend most of the time doing our jobs properly.<br>
<br>
Are many of these debates actually about what is best for the whole group or just who can be the most MVP through how much damage, spell casting or general overpowering can be done by one single player? <br>
(I have witnessed many a devious (or utterly mindless) player who has deliberately done something to undervalue another in the group, with the sole intent to make themselves look better when they &quot;come to the rescue&quot;).<br>
<br>
Btw - Enchanters at your Wizard's level have AoE Mez (I recommend it to be used, very good AoE stun that!) <br>

AoE mez, only if they have researched it, is an effective tool as Aelnelda had pointed out. However, if the MoB is dotted, even this fails, as was the case I sighted in High Hold Pass.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;- who regulates the AE stuns?&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The Enchanter, of course.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;- who snares what mob? More mobs to fight=more possible runners or gaters.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> At 44 (my Main)I have been summoned before but I have never ran into a Gater. I am sure I will learn about those soon enough. Runners are always a possibility, but I have never seen a stunned MoB run before. I think you have a moot point here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;- who taunts the mob that isn't stunned?&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I would assume the same person that taunts MoBs that are not mezzed. That would be the Tank. Also, my Wizzy Roots alot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;- even after /serverfilter, what happens to the players on lower-spec PCs at 56k when there's an AE fight going on? more lag and LDs.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The /serverfilter has helped lag out alot during raids. Any good caster also has either hotkeys tied to their spells or is proficiant with using the &lt;alt&gt; button. My Bard uses Hot Keys; my Wizzy uses a combanation of HotKeys and &lt;alt&gt;; my Pally (that be me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) uses &lt;alt&gt;. LD's happen and nothing will stop them. If LD's were a valid reason not to do something then there would never be a Planes Raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;- While the group is resting what happens if a wanderer comes by while you're all licking your wounds?&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A great 20th Century Philosifer coined a term &quot;The Strawman Arguement.&quot; This is where a an arguement is formed, usually with the &quot;what if...&quot; statement to attempt to invalidate a good point. Your point is moot because such can happen at anytime with a group using any type of tactics. Such an occurance is handled as best as it can be. Your question, I believe, stems from the assumption that a group will be lower on health and mana after an AoE battle than they would be in a single kill/mez the rest situation. Such an assumption is not valid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;you're the first wiz I've heard complain of running out of mana on single pulls: most have learnt to save their mana&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> At higher levels the mana available to spell usage ratio increases. Also, over 20, a Caster gains more mana with the increase of INT (or wisdom). As one gains levels, one should also gain INT gear, thereby increasing the mana pool further. Also, at lower levels, a caster is pretty much stuck with Breeze if they get anything at all. Most Nukers do not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> complain</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about going OOM because they know that between the time they set off their last nuke and the time the next one is called for, they can generally have the mana for it. Also, High Pass Orcs is not a &quot;single pull&quot; camp; It is generally a double or quad pop camp situation. Since this is where my Wizzy has spent all of his time post 16, it is the only place I can draw referance from.<br>
<br>
As far as single pulling is concerned, this is always the preferable option in any group anywhere. However, there are places where this is impossable (a really good Monk is not always available, for instance). Also, situations like breaking a camp also sometimes call for differant tactics than holding a camp once the spawn is broken and the pops are staggered.<br>
<br>
Aelnelda, I am glad you are observant. However, not everyone always is. This thread began because a person playing an alt sent me a tell when a Druid was breaking mezzes telling me to stop AoE use because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was breaking the mezzes. This person said his Main was an Enchanter and if anyone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ever</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> used an AoE in his group they would be booted. Although he finally stopped the tells, he refused to believe the facts of the situation and argued deligantly that it was I that was inituating the AoE's and that the Druid was blameless. I have seen simulair anti-AoE/Wizard biases before.<br>
<br>
 I have learned alot about both the Enchanter Class and the Wizard Class from this discussion. My point was, however, and still is that 1) There are proper uses for AoE's and 2) There are many Enchanters that refuse to recognise point #1.<br>
<br>
As far as getting into habits, this can be deadly and also can make an adventure not happen because a &quot;needed class&quot; is not available. I have been in groups that have had one or no tanks, but were heavy in Pet Classes. I have also been in groups entirely made up of tanks. One of the best groups I was ever in was in High Keep Warrior Room that was made up of entirely Paladins. Also, I have been known to effectively control the Sarnak Tower in OT that everyone says needs an Enchanter in the group with a Necro on Crowd Control. I find Necros very effecent at Crowd Control. Necros, BTW, can also be halfway good healers in a pinch.<br>
<br>
I guess my point here is that by falling into a single habit and not utilizing all that is available to one's class a person is missing out on alot of possibilities of overcoming situations in the most efficent manner possible. Also, they run the risk of failing to attain certain goals.<br>

<br>
You proved my point by showing that: The chanter had the pull mezzed. The mez broke, and they DIDN'T aggro the breaker, they aggroed the chanter. The chanter died. Maybe you did ok clearing the remainder, but the situation was under control before that, and resorting to AE attacks didn't rez the chanter that bought it. Therefore the group DID lose potential exp because the mez was broken. The moral: don't AE when the person whose responsibility is Crowd Control is mezzing. You get off scott free, the chanter suffers.<br>
<br>
AE stuns: so the chanter calls out when the next stun is due? what if the next stunner is lagging (likely, see below), or is recovering from a spell cast? Or is getting beaten on so can't get a cast off? The whole pull wakes up and all hell breaks loose.<br>
<br>
Gating mobs are a very real problem in mid-40s+ areas, eg: Karnors. You see one warning that they are about to gate, and if they get the gate spell off, they will return to their spawn point and heal up before coming back. An aggro'ed mob on its way back will bring any of its friends around as well. If you miss the gate (eg: waiting for stun to recover, no-one bashing, etc.), it'll go. If you're on many at once, the chances of missing a single gater is greater, hence the chances of bringing unwelcome guests to the party.<br>
<br>
The chances of MISSING a single mob in a group with an AE stun is high.  If they're about to run, they could easily slip out unnoticed. Not a moot point.<br>
<br>
Taunting mobs: the tanks have problems taunting a single angry mob off a caster. Who taunts MULTIPLE angry mobs off casters?<br>
<br>
Lag: I wasn't talking about hotkeys: try Crowd Controlling when there is lag - you know when you have a double pull because you've died.  Never mind hotkeying: you have nothing to react to. I guess raid strategies changed to accommodate lag, and normal fights should do their best to minimise it as well. Multiple aggro mobs (and the accompanying hits, graphics and battle spam) increase lag, /serverfilter or not. Simply telling 56k-ers to switch off /auction and hits off is not the sign of a good strategy which accommodates lag.<br>
<br>
The &quot;what if&quot; scenario is no Strawman: You kill more mobs at once regularly, the whole group will be low mana far more often than with single pulls. This is fact. Wandering (or unwelcome guests) are more likely as well (see my arguments above re: missing potential runners). Fighting large numbers of mobs at once is going closer to a zero mana situation than chanter mezzing. This makes the group more likely to have members die, or force an evac (and if the wiz or druid are burning mana on AE nukes, who's evaccing?).<br>
<br>
I haven't heard wizards complaining of being oom AT ALL - never mind at higher levels. Once they learn that they can't chain cast (usually pre-level 10), they get used to casting when they are needed. As I say, you are the first wizard I have come across who complains of running out of mana with one-at-a-time fights.<br>
<br>
As far as the War Room and the Sarnak Tower are concerned: the tactics there are so different than those needed at high levels. It's like playing a different game. The specialisms of each class become so pronounced that pick-up groups of 5 tanks and a wizard just do NOT cut it. <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - The Jester of Avalon<br>
