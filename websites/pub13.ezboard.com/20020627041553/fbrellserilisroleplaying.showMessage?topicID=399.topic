No voices were yet raised above a whisper, as if a single shout might shatter the foundation of ice upon which we stood. Time did not exist here, only death. The walls themselves told of this inevitability. Frozen corpses stared back at us through those walls, their faces fixed in a myriad of emotions...fear, surprise, hatred...fixed for all eternity. They were a caution to foolhardy adventurers wandering here by choice or by chance. And still we progressed through the twisted tunnels of Permafrost. <br>
<br>
Very little life existed here, goblins in the majority, but they were merely the scum that tainted every zone, for they lived throughout Norrath in some form or another. There was only one law here, that of the dragon. Kill or be killed, and to this law we adhered, for we had come to destroy Lady Vox herself. A huge beast, with scales that glittered like new fallen snow, but with a blinding menace. She had skills in magical arts that would make most clerics ripe with envy and possessed knowledge greater than most of the races of Norrath combined. Lady Vox could never truly be killed, for out of the ashes of her death, like the phoenix, she arose again. She would always be there to test young adventurers time and again. It was a necessary thing for there were greater perils in Norrath than Dragons and those that had not the mettle to face the latter, were best kept out of the way of those who were proven able to tackle the former. And so we had gathered, whether for glory or through avarice, we had come to slay the Dragon. <br>
<br>
Being one of the few dark elves in attendance I kept to myself and studied my spell book in preparation for the upcoming battle. Soon we would be fortified against the Dragon's frigid breath by the clerics, shamans, druids and necromancers that joined our ranks. I closed my spell book and the call rang out, echoing down the icy corridors. It was time...we all lined up for buffing and as the chosen casters augmented us we were suspended in a peculiar stasis. As we waited we went over our plan of attack... <br>

These fighters would attempt to beat the Dragon down or at the very least, distract and fatigue her as the casters, such as myself slipped in and helped to finish the creature.  Nothing burned more deadly than a wizard's flame, and I had all such spells at hand.  <br>
<br>
Now the moment had come, we were prepared and the plan of attack finalized.  A shiver, more from anticipation than cold ran down my spine.  We marched with grim determination towards the great stone that blocked the Dragon's lair.  Those amongst our &quot;muscle&quot; braced themselves against it and began to push.  With a resounding crack of the ice that had frozen the rock to the floor, it began to move.  The lair now stood open, collectively we seemed to brace ourselves, should the Dragon come charging out and end our raid before it had even begun.  After waiting a few moments, which seemed like an eternity, no such doom came.  The fighters gathered themselves at the entrance.  A cry of &quot;CHARGE!&quot; rang out and they burst inward swords brandished and gleaming in the reflected light of the icy walls.  We casters stood, the sounds of battle echoed from within, waiting for the call that would bring us into action.  Time passed...too much time?  We began to wonder, mutters of doubt were passed from ear to ear.  They said, &quot;This is not good, it has been to long, the Dragon will remain undefeated,&quot; heavy with disappointment.  All such concerns were erased in a moment as the call again rang out telling us to charge.<br>
<br>
I ran through that hole in the frozen wall, my eyes darting wildly, trying to sight the Dragon and begin assisting in the attack.  I was eager, this would be the first time I would face such a creature and I knew we must succeed, for such failure could haunt one forever.  I spotted her, she was beautiful, terribly beautiful.  Lady Vox held a frightening majesty and for a moment I was mesmerized by it, until she roared.  A Dragon's roar, the sound of legend, there is nothing that walks this realm either living or dead that makes so terrifying a sound.  The wave of sound washed over me, through me, tearing at my resolve.  Fear screamed at me, &quot;RUN!&quot;, and yet I could not.  I stood there, frozen &lt;smirk&gt; until the violence of noise passed.  With significant effort I gathered my wits about me and ran at Lady Vox, to unleash my own terror.  <br>
<br>
I cast, everything I was, every fiber of my being threw itself into this effort.  Flame after flame seared her as the warriors still left standing beat her down, attacking every weak spot as it was created.  The Dragon was flailing, her breath now labored, she was defeated, she knew it, as did we.  So we continued, relentless, our victory now assured.  Lady Vox would fall, but she would not fall alone, in her remaining seconds of life, she cast one final, lethal spell and I was among those caught in it.  I felt my own life being drained out of me, I fell to the ground, a mere moment before the Dragon did as well.  I screamed my vengeance, and then I knew nothing more.<br>
<br>
Time passed, I know not how much, but I was awakened by the chanting of a cleric over my corpse.  I stood, shivering and still weak from the effects of the resurrection even as she cast her heals upon me.  I could only mumble my thanks as I stooped over my corpse and gathered my belongings.  After wrapping my robe tightly around me, I began to look around me.  There lay the Dragon.  The glory of Lady Vox was now ours.  The room at once seemed alive with victory.  Pride in our accomplishment coursed through my veins and I raised my voice in a triumphant shout.  It was immediately joined by others and in that moment there was no racial nor class distinctions, only the camaraderie that mutual victory might bring.  <br>
<br>
I chuckled to myself, glancing around the room at some of the lightcrawlers that had attended this raid.  Today, I thought, today we are equals in defeating a common foe, but tomorrow my dear moths, the old lines will still be drawn.  Even in the warm afterglow of our combined accomplishment I did not regret the ancient wars that stood throughout time and always would. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=399.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=399.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=1><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=399.topic><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/del1.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=399.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=399.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm70">News and Events<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">The Outer Realm (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">The Hall of Honor<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">The Fellowship of Guilds<option value="brellserilisfrm53">The Valley of Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">The Back Alley (Link to Rants)<option value="brellserilisfrm71">Raids: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (BUYING)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Selling and Trading)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
