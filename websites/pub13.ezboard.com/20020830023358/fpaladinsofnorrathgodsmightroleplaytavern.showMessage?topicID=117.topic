Paladins are holy warriors, fighters for their cause. The fight without doubt, or confusion, and they serve their diety to the fullest.

Love it the only magic that can heal your heart, bind your soul to another, or create the finest things in all of Norrath and Luclin. Love is the master I serve, and to question love, to give in to hate, to acknowledge fear or loathing would defeat the whole point of being a Paladin of Erollisi.<br>I do not question my faith. <br>I do not give in to hate, fear, or malace.<br>I show everyone the power and glory of love.<br><br>That is the way to play a Paladin. <br><br>Cephany Lopod<br>Paladin of Erollisi <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udefymortality.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Defy Mortality</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/28/02 7:50:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  A DIFFERENT way to roleplay a paladin</span><hr size=1> aye, if yer faith is shaken, and not total, then you lose your paladin powers roleplaying wise.<br><br>Roleplaying wise it's ok, like in a d&amp;d game, where you'd have to face the consequences of losing your powers, and have to do some quest/deed to regain them.<br><br>but in eq, it's not so solid.<br><br>Not saying that faith is never shaken, paladins do lose faith, but they do regain it, and redeem themselves, etc.<br>But if he's starting to trust dark elf necromancers, that gets a little wierd.<br><br>also that means the necro isn't roleplaying right =P <p><small><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=145574">Kahlin Cagn</a><br><b>Destitute Gnome Paladin</small></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 1505<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 9:09:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  A DIFFERENT way to roleplay a paladin</span><hr size=1> I call this the Drizzt/Twinkie fator.

It gets tiring seeing the people who go to either extreme and call it role-playing. The problem is you get people on one side who develop a story where there is little internal conflict. They are paladin. They are Lawful Good. They do wield a holy weapon. And they do destroy evil. And then you get the people who try just a little too hard. They are NOT lawful good anymore(Yet they want to be a paladin. And some DM's let them.), they learn from evil, and their holy weapons helps them to kill innocents if they get in the way. Now, the problem is that I don't really like these extremes. However, both are valid. Both deserve recognition. And both can have interesting stories. A God, for instance, may choose to continue to give power to a fallen paladin if his actions have the possibility to cause a greater good.<br><br>For instance, I have a friend(how many stories start like this). I was playing a cleric of a particular faith and he was playing a paladin of that same faith. It comes to the surface that there are some very corrupt(supernaturally so) characters within our group. My friend, at first, does not lose faith in the God, but lost faith in it's practice. Meanwhile, my character is advancing and learning of the inner workings of the church and why some of the head of the church are corrupt as such. Our characters are very often at odds, even though he has sworn to be my procterate knight.<br><br>He eventually does fall, and takes up an oath to destroy the church. With the oath, came new responsibilities and new powers as the very high end encounters in the church are vampiric in nature. However, his new patriarch's abilities are unknown. He was blinded, because of hatred and THAT is what made him fall.<br><br>It is quite a bit more interesting to play characters that are at least slightly left of center. Those are the characters we most love in books. The best characters have some internal conflict. The first poster might, for instance, see the power that this necromancer wielded. Finding some disgust in the way his people worship he would like to return them to the faith. With power like the necromancer had, maybe it would be attainable. Maybe if he could raise the dead for instance, he could have them speak of their afterlife. To put the fright of disobeying Tunare in them. Maybe he feels, internally, that he is getting nowhere in his fights against evil. He knew very little about them and now that he knows and cares for his enemy he will be a greater service to tunare. At some point he might snap out of it, maybe even bring a child of Innoruk back to the Tunare where he should be now if Innoruk had not twisted his people.<br><br>The point I'm trying to make is that there are fine lines that one can validly walk. Building that bit of the story is what makes them much more of a hero. Because they were once weak we as people can identify with them. Because everything isn't black or white we as people can identify with them. Anyway, that's just my opinion. The important thing about RPing is that ya have fun doing it.<br> <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158863">Callalily Serein</A><BR>The Littlest Knight of Karana<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uicriver20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>icriver20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/1/02 10:04:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> my view</span><hr size=1>      I am relatively new to the role of a Pally, so mock at will...LOL.

Paladins serve <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   their god</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and their god only. This is a very important distinction to make. Of the eight different gods that paladins can follow, Tunare, Mithaniel Marr, Erollisi Marr, and Rodcet Nife are basically good. Prexus, Brell Serilis, Karana, and Quellious are neutral. The former gods specifically seek to serve and protect life in general, while the latter gods are content to just stay neutral, but can exhibit good and evil tendencies as it suits them, except Quellious who must be neutral in order to remain peaceful (some may say that being peaceful means one is good but I personally believe that true tranquility and peace denotes neutrality as peace cannot be maintained if one chooses sides).<br><br>That being said, I think that one can do whatever he wants as a paladin as long as his god does not disallow it. For example, I doubt that Erollisi Marr would like to see her followers kill Mithaniel Marr. However, I am a dwarven paladin who follows Brell Serilis, a neutral god, and as long as I do not displease him I think that he does not care who or what I kill as long as I have a reason for doing so. I personally have no qualms about killing Erollisi Marr in her sleep and I doubt that Brell Serilis cares either. I serve my god and not the sense of good that everyone else prescribes to. I refuse to harm gnomes and dwarves who are not interfering with Brell Serilis as we are all His children and must protect each other. Though this seems benevolent, it really is not as I am not doing it to be nice, I am doing it for my god. I also refuse to harm other noble paladins as we are all brothers and, even though our gods are different, our reverence to our god is absolute and our way of life is the same. However, if you should come into conflict with the true children of Norrath or Brell Serilis, I will slay you where you stand, Paladin or not, as my tie to my god is stronger than my bond to other knights.<br><br>Therefore, kudos to the first poster for trying something new even though it is not always benevolent. The only thing that a paladin must always have is an unwavering faith in his god, though occasionally questioning his faith in order to achieve greater enlightenment is alright. As long as you always stay true to your god and his wishes then you can do whatever you want to. For example, if you follow Prexus, be kind to the ocean and its inhabitants (especially the Kedge). Beyond the ocean Prexus does not care what happens. Murder as many wood elves as you want as they are creatures of the land and, as such, are not protected by Prexus. Being good is a matter if opinion. For example, if you are a follower of Innoruuk and kill thousands of women and children you are being &quot;good&quot; as you are serving your god and his wishes.<br><br>By the way, this game is called EverQuest and is not based on the AD&amp;D ruleset so anybody that bases an argument on the AD&amp;D rules will not sway me and will barely even hold my attention. I frankly could care less whether or not a paladin falls if he is not always good in AD&amp;D. If I wanted to use AD&amp;D rules I would play Baldur's Gate. Just because AD&amp;D is a great P&amp;P RPGthat spawned much of the genre does not mean that its rules are the gospel for every other game that has a paladin class. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorok</A> at: 7/4/02 2:52:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udalantia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalantia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/5/02 3:34:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fennin-ro.com/images/Item/img1-158.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my view</span><hr size=1> Your view is wrong, in my opinion, then.<br><br>We're all wired in a way that we know that there is a difference between right and wrong, it's just that some of us can ignore it with impunity.  The Tier'Dal know what they do is wrong, but they think Inny's pleased by it, so they do it anyway.  It is *NOT* made good by the fact that they think their diety likes it.  Relativism cannot exist in the world of the paladin, or we have paladins that are actually evil.  Evil Paladin is a shadowknight.<br><br>My opinion is that paladins are to serve good, in the way of their god.  For example, Erollisi gives me a bit more freedom to act with compassion, as compared to, say, Mithaniel.  Erollisi has no problem with me seducing pretty Tier'Dal lady in order to make her see the light; Mithaniel would rather I smote them.<br><br>Randomly killing other beings because &quot;They aren't protected by your god&quot; is evil.  If I were to simply randomly kill Tier'Dal, Ogres, and Trolls, even if they were trying to reform, Erollisi would have my powers revoked faster than I could blink.<br><br>It's easy to justify an action by saying &quot;Good is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;  However, if you do that, you say that Paladins can act like Shadowknights and still remain paladins. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60479>Dalantia Dragonet</a><br>Cavalier of the Golden Rose, 51st Petal<br>Kendriel Truthspeaker<br>Dedicated of the Silent Fist, 21st Degree<br>Fennin Ro<br>Ambassador of the Second Foundation<br>"What do you mean he's unstoppable?

The dark elves may not think of themselves as 'evil' but simply as being right. But when we refer to them OOC they are evil. Some may be lawful (Iksar) and others chaotic (Trolls), but they are evil by definition (that that is our definition, not theirs). The same goes for Deities.<br><br>Based on AD&amp;D, the game EQ is based off of, ALL paladins follow good. This is what differentiates them from clerics. Clerics follow the teachings of their deity. Paladins follow good &amp; their deity. Thus the major difference between a paladin of Mithaniel and a paladin of Tunare, is the Marr follower would focus more of his attention to intelligent races (those capable of deception) and the Tunare follower would focus more on protecting nature. The Mithaniel paladin would still stop the followers of the plaguebringer from poisoning a stream and killing the animals of a forest. Likewise the Tunare paladin would stop a plot against a major city of good people from a similar plot if she heard about it. THAT is what being a paladin is about.<br><br>Good people don't kill innocents; Paladins actually go out of their way to stop the killing of innocents. They uphold the teaching of their deities for the greater good of all who accept them, but they are all bound by a similar code of ethics and honor.<br><br>One last thing everyone should remember, this is PANTHEON. Everyone at least believes in all the deities. At some point or another almost everyone pays homage to a deity other than their patron deity. For example, a human farmer may have Karana as his patron deity because the rains are vital to his crops. But he will also pay tribute to Tunare to watch over his livestock, Brell (??) for furtile soil, and he may even have a small ritual (read 'superstition') that he does to appease Brexx to keep the plague away. When his children marry the ceremony will he held under the banner of Erollisi. The same would go for a dwarven farmer except Brell would be his primary. The exception to this would be the Iksar and other followers of Cazic-Thule. I believe he demands absolute devotion. Inny might be the same way.<br><br>I hope in EQ2 they make being a paladin more than just choosing it from a menu. I hope it requires living up to a high standard to progress through the ranks of Paladinhood. Someone who doesn't cut it will be little more than a warrior OR a cleric.<br><br>--edit--<br>BTW I wanted to add as proof to this: Notice that all paladins have access to spells with good dieties names in them even if they don't follow that diety specifically. This is because we protect good, and in that cause, many non-evil dieties can be called upon by a paladin for the greater good of all.<br><br><br> <p><html><head><title></title></head><body><img src=http://home.insight.rr.com/cylria/cylriafvrelax.jpg><BR>Cylria Silversong<BR>Minstrel of the Twins<BR>Firiona Vie<BR></body></html></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucylria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cylria</A> at: 7/8/02 9:12:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugalidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 641<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/02 9:20:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.prexus.com/playerpics/galidin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  A DIFFERENT way to roleplay a paladin</span><hr size=1> My paladin if a crusader of life, bringing aid to any who needs it and sworn to strike down any who would seek to spread or aid the forces of death and decay.

This has been founded in literacy from the legends of King Author and similar works to the role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. However, what are paladins really? <br><br>A paladin refers to a holy warrior (as apposed to clergy). This would not be anyone fighting in the name of a god/goddess, but rather one that the church sanctifies as one of their own. This was seen in history during the Crusader Wars. <br><br>Though the popular belief of paladins is the romantic notion they are beyond evil, this is not the case in history. Rather the church forgave the crusaders their sins in exchange for service to the church. To kill another human being is considered a cardinal sin in most religions and belief structures. Yet the crusaders (and their like) not only entered war with the intent to kill but to carry that war into the homeland of the non-believers to slay any who would not accept their god. Many history documents refer to the rape, pillage (act of theft), and plunder (loot) committed during the crusades. Not to mention the slaughter of innocents if the believed in a “false” god. <br><br>I conclude that in the role-play of a paladin, it is not the fearless, righteous, and good-hearted icon that so many seem to believe. Rather, a warrior that believes any sin he does in the name of the church is forgiven in service of the church. That the act of carrying his deity’s will on earth makes any sin a small price in the “big-picture” of an eternal struggle of the god. The only difference (other than game mechanics) in the role-play of a Anti-Paladin or Shadow Knight that accepts damnation is that a Paladin believes the forgiveness of sin in the name of the church places them beyond sin. <br><br>Below are some references to consider before flaming.
