It was the year 3105; the Ferocity clan had made Kelethin their new home in Norrath. After the cruel over taking of the once known land of Tunaria, all they had left was Faydwer. Amongst this humble land, the Ferocity clan lived without much knowledge of each other. Before Korikious and Talina came to Kelethin, they lived a quite humble life in the woods of Tunaria. They would travel back and forth between Surefall Glade and the Rivervale quite often bringing aid to their elven and halfling brethren. A while before Talia left Tunaria, after the fall of the Elven Empire, she had a sabbatical to the Tree Temple of Surefall. Although she never mentioned it, she thought of Surefall Glade as her true home. NO other place was as peaceful and beautiful as the city within the glades. She came here for seclusion and seeking knowledge from the great druids. It was here that something very special happened. Talia knew of the troubles to be and had spoken to the Druids and the rangers to keep her children safe. This is where Falcone and Elsin, the twin resided for a while. However, to no ones knowledge, another babe was to be left there as well. A child so full of life his eyes shined as though they where obsidian pieces. He was a strong babe and full of life. He also was left in Surefall but with the rangers. They never spoke of him to anyone this is where the life of Svaboda begins. <br>
Well again, I feel, as I am inapt for anything. The clerics say I cannot study with them for I am a half elf. How arrogant can them ghostly colored elves be. Jeez, I am as noble as anyone else is. Well Tynkale says that I would make a fine paladin except that my strengths would be more greatly used as a warrior in Kelethin would. I think he was mad when he tried teaching me the magic shield spell and I ended up burning a hole through his Tunic! Tynkale laughed for an hour, what a great guy. I then went to Kelethin to speak to the Emerald Warriors. Funny, I still feel the burning in my heart as though I was a paladin. In any case, I do not care what my profession is as long as I stay true to the great mother of all, Tunare. The other day I brought some mail to Jakum in the bards guild (I kind of feel like I need to be in the good with these guys, don't know why), from that looker half elf in the docks of Butcher Block (heart pounding!) and he said that I look just like my brothers, all but one. I was shocked to say the least. I said, &quot;Jakum have you been hanging out with them dwarves again? My lord you must be quite touched by ale, I have none other than me self in me family. I know not even the names of me parents, save Tynkale has been a father to me since I remember taking me first breath.&quot; Oh young Svaboda, you have much to learn of the whereabouts of the Ferocity clan, I cannot tell you what, for I was not appointed to lead you to them. Idia will be back in 3 moons from Firona, when she returns I will send for you to speak to her.&quot; Ackk, what a jerk, leave it to a bard to be full of riddle and jests! Sheesh, what a way to tell some one that they are not alone, that they do have siblings or parents. Heh, who knows all I want to do is continue with learning my skills if I do have a family we will see what becomes of it. Well, I am getting a bit perplexed, the other day as I was entering Kelethin bank a young druid stopped and looked at me like if he had seen a ghost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=274.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=238.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
