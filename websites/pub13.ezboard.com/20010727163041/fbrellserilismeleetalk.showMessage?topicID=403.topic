Anyway, some of these look good, some look bad....but mostly good =). Lets hope some of these make it live, i'm especially hoping for crit spells that would add in stuns or some other effect, that would be most fun of all. tired of seeing melee damage range from 1 to 400+ from glances to crippling blows, I want to see some sort of variety instead of the same old numbers every day. (Not that I want 1's)<br>
<br>
Wizards:<br>
<br>
ITEM: Increased mana regeneration.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: By whatever method. This is one of the few ideas for increasing the wizards effectiveness against creatures with a lot of hit points.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Spell efficiency.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: As monsters gain more hit points, the wizard is finding his mana comparatively less and less useful (since it's use is mostly for making monster hit points go away). Also, as a general rule, it seems that magicians can produce nearly as much damage per point of mana as a wizard (based solely on damage spells, not considering pets). Wizards would like a more efficient mana to damage ratio across the board, but specifically when dealing with the massive monsters of Velious.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Percentage Damage Spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: A spell line idea that would allow wizards to keep up with the massive hit points of some NPCs. The spell would do damage that was a percentage of the targets current hit points. This would allow the wizard to do more damage to bigger monsters and less to smaller ones.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Level Cap on spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The six level limit on damage spells really harms the wizard that is in an aggressive group (one that goes after deep reds). Consider that those that are now just immune to these spells would probably resist most of them anyway.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Al'Kabor line of spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The consensus is that this spell line is far less useful than the parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells. It seems that the benefit if a larger area of affect and a single extra target is not worthy of the increased mana cost. Frankly, it seems that there are no wizards casting this spell in Norrath. Increasing its radius could be very messy. Adding more targets might be the best solution. Or perhaps adding a stun component to the spell.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Flaming Sword of Xuzl.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: How about allowing this thing to work sort of more like a DoT (as with the clerical hammer spell). Making it immune to spells and riposte might work to make this spell more useful, and might somewhat increase the wizards effectiveness against enemies with massive hit points once their mana is gone.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Harvest.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The feeling is that this spell doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50. Some folks want to see this spell recast faster.<br>
<br>
Also, there seems to be a bug with the spell gem for Harvest. When the caster is hit, the gem will 'pop-up' again, even though the recast time has not been met, and the spell can't be cast again.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Rain Spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Take pets out of the equation. Perhaps the resist rates on these spells is to high. Also, increasing the over-all number of waves a bit (maybe only by 1) might be a good idea. Another suggestion was to simply make these spells single target only or a very small radius (small enough that pets won't be in it if they are attacking the targeted monster).<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Atol's Spectral Shackles.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: As a level 51 spell, it fizzles too much; reportedly more than Fetter, a level 58 spell.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Snare/Enstill.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare without ever having snare. Replacing the AoE snare with a single target snare might make more sense out of the spell line, and probably reduce quad kiting. This might also be considered a nerf by some. Also, there is a call to give Enstill a minimum duration. It seems that wizards think this spell breaks too early too often.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Invisibility to Undead.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Why do wizards have this spell?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Teleport - West Karana.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Move this portal to the other side of the zone. This has its fair share of technical nightmares (complete rebuilding of the zone and time to download it). But it’s worth looking into, especially with the possible addition of new bind points.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Teleport - Cazil Thule Gate.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Many players think this is in too dangerous of a location.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Fade, shadowstep and yonder.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: These spells have problems going vertically.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Evacs.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The suggestion was made that Evacs should take link-dead characters with the party.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Evacs and Abscond.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Players are saying me that these spells do not clear aggro like they should.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Abscond.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This is another spell that fizzles too frequently.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Concussion spell scroll.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This is believed to be too hard to obtain. But, consider that this is a great spell, having to earn it seems like a good thing. The question is, is it too hard to get?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Melee-proof NPCs.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: The logic goes like this. Since there are an increasingly large number of magically immune (or exceedingly resistant) NPCs in the world, making wizards less useful in many encounters, how about creating melee resistant NPCs that would likewise reduce the usefulness of melee characters. Perhaps ghosts and spirits would be a way to put this idea into the game that makes sense in the world.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Diamond Rod.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: This is dropped by Innoruuk. It seems that this rod requires a component to work. That seems out of line with the idea of having a magic item to cast spells for you.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Imbue Fire Opal Scroll.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: To get this scroll you must get into Nagafen's lair. The spell is only 29th level. This seems like a bit of a stretch for a 29th level character. If the spell is that powerful, then perhaps raise its level appropriately. If not, perhaps move it so that an appropriate leveled character can get it.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Eye of Zomm.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: These eyes only have a swim skill of 1. This makes them very slow swimmers, and not useful underwater. Is this intentional?<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Damage spell variety.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: One of the powers of the wizard is his ability to use a variety of damage types. But at any given time he may have to reach back several levels just to find that variety. Perhaps they should have a spell of each damage type at every level.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Critical Hits with Spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: After all, warriors can do it, and it doesn't cost them mana. If wizards are specialized in doing damage, then why not give them critical hits with damage spells? The critical could be more damage, a stun, or some other effect.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Target too low level bug.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: It seems that if you have a lower level character targeted and cast a high level self-only spell (like Plainsight) the spell won't cast. The code that prevents some spells from being cast on much lower level characters is reading the target as the one targeted, not the caster.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Quad Kiting.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: Is this something that characters should be able to do? The two classes that seem to be able to do this are wizards and druids. Perhaps the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is.<br>
<br>
STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Suppression spells.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: A spell that would make is so that a target could not cast a certain spell type or use an ability type. The most common suggestion of this type of spell was to prevent gating or summoning.<br>
<br>
STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item at this time.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
ITEM: Blink Spell.<br>
<br>
DESCRIPTION: A player suggested an interesting new spell idea. Allow the masters of teleportation and knowledge to predict danger and ‘blink’ away from it. Basically, it would be a buff that would react with a shadowstep when the character is hit with melee damage, popping them to safety.<br>

However casters do not follow the same scale of growth in power, we get items with more int, a little bit more mana, none of them &quot;really&quot; make us more powerful.  If VI has finally realized that to make casters more viable they need items that give mana regen, lower resist rate, increase damage, etc then they're on the right track. <p><br><font face="Arial" size="-2">Vumil Darksoul<br>

We have no group friendly buffs and we die very fast. For example when I group with my wizard in karnors i can maybe take 10 to 11 hits before I'm dead. Thats with 1k of HP buffed with arch shielding, un buffed i have 790 HP. Now I don't mind this but if I'm going to sacrifice so much I want to be able to Blow stuff up.<br>
I don't really care about much else. If you have ever read any midevil book or anything like that the wizard is the most powerful thing there. (although very weak)Now I if mages, druids, enchanters, and (this is the very scary part) clerics can nuke almost as good as the wizard why even play one. <br>

For 1 I do think the recast on harvest should be shorter. I also think there should be and increasing amount of + mana items although with vellious I have been seeing more of them. I have noticed that that the wizard class get overlooked more than I think they should concerning groups and there value. a good thing I can think of considering were so weak in the HP department is a spell like clerics divine aura, and most of all I still think our epic sux ass to obtain when plenty of the other classes are getting thiers (generalization). All in all I love my wizzie and with the exception of my monk dont really feel the desire to play another class.

Yes I would like to see VI take a look at the wizard class and they would probably see that they are making the wizards fade away from groups.
