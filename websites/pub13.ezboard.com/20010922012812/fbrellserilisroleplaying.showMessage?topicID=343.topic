They were a very close knit group and helpful.  She learned a little about picking locks and moving stealthfully through the streets but would never be as good as those who taught her.  But things were happening elsewhere in the world that would soon send her out to discover areas of her own talent.<br>
<br>
One day while sitting on the dock in Freeport a man came up to her and started talking to her.  &quot;Hello there pretty lady?&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned from the sunset and smiled up to him, &quot;Hello, can I help you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, now that is a baited question, but honestly I was going to ask if I could help you.&quot;  He replied with a roguish grin.<br>
<br>
She responded to the smile with a blush, amazed at the reactions she felt.  Normally she talked to very few men, most still made her feel uncomfortable after the incident with Kroon.  &quot;Oh really?&quot; She teased, &quot;And how might you do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That sunset is too beautiful to waste alone, and I thought I might offer some companionship.&quot;  He sat down next to her without her asking, and leaned back looking out over the water.  &quot;I love the way the colors move over the water like they were liquid themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kestri tilted her head to the side and looked at the man.  He was taller than her by a good six inches and would be considered handsome by most of the women she knew.  The women in the rogue’s guild were constantly comparing men and talking about their features and other things that made the bard blush a deep red.  Automatically her mind ran to the things the girls discussed late at night. He was tall, had a strong jaw line, light colored hair, a well-trimmed beard and moustache, a mischievous twinkle to his eyes and he body was taught with strength under his lightweight armor.  &quot;Are you a monk by chance?&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned to her, amused look in his eyes and a welcoming smile on his lips, &quot;Are you a gypsy fortune teller then?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kestri tossed her head back and laughed, &quot;Ah you know me so well already.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But to answer your question, yes I am a Master of the fighting arts.&quot;  She could feel the pride coming from him as he spoke.<br>
<br>
Her eyes grew a bit distant as she thought of Arean, &quot;I am sure that you are very talented then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Looking at her closely, &quot;And you are very beautiful.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kestri's attention was drawn instantly back to him, &quot;You are quite the flatterer as well.&quot;  She ran a hand self-consciously through her short hair.  The scar on her scalp kept her hair from growing out in the spot and anytime she tried to regain the length she once had it, it grew in all different directions, so she kept it in a short style that most said flattered her.  But she missed having it long and felt she looked boyish with it this length.<br>
<br>
&quot;I only speak the truth.  Your eyes are warm; you have delicate features and hold yourself with grace and poise.  There is nothing more beautiful than a self assured bard.&quot;<br>
<br>
At hearing that her emotions began to build barriers, she had no idea how he knew what she did.  Kestri's eyes grew calculating, &quot;What makes you think I am a bard?&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyes saw the change in her demeanor and spoke softly as if trying to calm a skittish animal, &quot;A few months ago I was passing through the area they call East Commons and I stopped in a Inn and heard a beautiful voice singing from a corner by the bar.  That voice warmed my night and has haunted my dreams since.  When I came off the boat from the dwarven lands I looked over and saw the owner of the voice that has haunted me all these days.&quot;  Kestri was amazed at his story but could not believe that she had affected him so and she started to speak, but he continued on. &quot;That night I sat far from you, just letting the sound of your songs carry over me like the waves on the ocean out there.  I stayed as long as you sang and as you were packing up I left you a platinum piece in your hat.&quot; <br>
<br>
The young bard now remembered that night well, that was the first time she had ever received such a large payment for her songs.  He kept talking looking into her eyes now, &quot;That night I stayed at the Inn and vowed I would get to know you, but when I woke I had found the Inn keeper had not even allowed you to stay the night.  I told him that his gratitude for a talent such as your knew no bounds, and I left immediately.  I looked through all the Inns in the area, but was so close to Freeport I worried that I would never catch up with you in this vast city.&quot; He struggled with the next words, &quot;I did look though, you had captivated me and I vowed to find you, but had no luck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I belong to a group that fights all over these lands and could not stay for a long time, so I left knowing that one day I would find you or my dreams would be destined to fail.&quot;  He blushed then and looked back to the sea.<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I...&quot; the bard stammered at a loss for words, &quot;that story is beautiful and I am honored that I would be the woman that you wished to find.  I hope that I am not a disappointment to you now that we have met.&quot;  She blushed not sure what to say.  Men had flirted with her before, but her fear had kept them at a distance and instantly her heart trusted this man.<br>
<br>
&quot;You would delight the Gods themselves, if they existed.&quot;  He laughed to himself, &quot;and for a man such as I to spend a few moments in your company is ambrosia itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled at that knowing many people in this land didn't believe in the Gods that formed this world, &quot;I am but a mere woman and flattered by your attentions.&quot;<br>
<br>
He grew distant for a moment and then he stood, &quot;As much as I would love to spend more time in your company I am afraid my duty calls.  My guild needs me to help them in a distant place.  I hope to return someday and spend more time in your company, but for now, the friendship we have started will have to satisfy my heart.&quot; <br>
<br>
A woman walked up to him who was hauntingly beautiful and dressed in the fashion of a Druid.  He smiled at her and hugged her, turning back to Kestri he smiled sadly and waved goodbye as they faded out.<br>
<br>
For weeks Kestri sat on the docks and waited for him, she knew not even his name or the guild he belonged to, but wished to see him again, but he never returned to her.  As she lay in bed at night she thought of the songs of love and decided that one day the man for her would come and when she found him she hoped that her heart was a warmed by him, as this monks was for her.<br>
