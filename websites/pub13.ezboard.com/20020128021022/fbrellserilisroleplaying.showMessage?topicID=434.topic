Asmodeus had been sleeping for more than twenty hours, but Malak had been unable to get any rest himself.  The image of the wizards handless arm haunted his vision when his eyes closed, and he was forced to sit in the bar, staring at the fire.  The soldiers and sorcerers of Freeport had been badly shaken by Asmodeus’s return, the great Wizard had never been beaten before.  The Halfling picket line had been overrun not long before Asmodeus made his escape, the forces then dissapearing.  Noone knew if the Fort still had D’Jarvok in it, if Rivervale had been taken over, if they were in the forest, noone knew anything.  They were stuck here in this cursed city, waiting for the Humans to decide what to do.  Cervantes and Geryon want to head for Feydwer to try and get the other races involved, but the Humans were keeping them here, confident that they could still handle this.  <br><br>Malak was relegated to walking the streets, staring into the lean and angry faces of the townspeople as reports from Rivervale came in.  The bodies of the halflings were being burned in the Western Commons, the smoke visible even from here.  The Militia and Paladins of Freeport were in contact with Queynos, and they were planning a two sided assault on Rivervale in three days, but until then, there was nothing to be done.  The bars were never full, the shops did little business, the streets remained deserted.  Even the Crow’s nest, a favorite haunt of all the races friendly to Freeport, had been deserted for more than 4 days. Malak sullenly sitting in one of the chairs by the fire, checking on Asmodeus when he could.  Cervantes and Geryon rarely left the solitude of their rooms, Geryon meticulously caring for his armor and weapons, Cervantes staring out his windows across the ocean, towards Feydwer.  Malak was slowly losing his patience with these humans.  If they failed in their attack 3 days from now, he would take Geryon and Cervantes and head for Kaladim to get the help of King Stormhammer.  The situation was getting more grim by the hour, with no end or relief in sight.<br><br>The screams echoed off of the stone cliff faces in Rivervale.  Empty kegs and bottles missing their liquor were strewn about the roads and pathways.  Furniture and clothing were heaped in piles outside the homes, burning with an evil glint in the moonlight, casting shadows onto the stone walls.  Halflings were huddled together in little groups, chained or tied together, guarded by the most sober of the remaining evil forces.  The rest of the conquering hordes had gathered themselves in the main square, cheering and dancing around the burning remains of the Rivervale bank.  They threw bottles, pieces of furniture, dead bodies, sometimes even live bodies, into the fire to keep it burning, those on the outskirts cooking hunks of meat hanging off of branches and weapons.  The Orcs and Gnolls were seperated by a group of more than 40 halflings chained near the fire, the undead seperated by even more.  The Dark Elves had opted to camp near the Kithicor entrance, and Jonathan had gone up to the top floor of the huge inn in the center of town.  All was relatively quiet among the forces, with fights breaking out only over particularly well cooked food or large containers of alcohol.  All in all, it was a quiet night for the forces of D’Jarvok, however absent he might be.<br><br>Jonathan stared down from his balcony, the fires of the bank glinting redly from his eyes, his smile lighted orange.  The devastation of Rivervale was nearly complete, a small pocket of fenced in Halflings in the south edge of the town the only remnant of freedom left.  They were walled in, but had managed to hold off his forces with Druidic magics and a line of heavily armored warriors.  No matter, he mused.  They can stay in their hole as long as they want to.  They had to come out for food eventually, and the Druid wasn’t going to keep them fed for much longer.  Jonathan would hang him by his thumbs from the walls of this Inn, perhaps letting the Dark Elves use him as target practice.  The future was filled with possiblities for this city.  The first thing that he had to do however was to secure the city against the counter-attack he knew was coming.  His scouts told him about the gathering forces near Queynos yesterday, and he was almost positive a comparable force was headed over from Freeport.  It only made sense to prepare for them, but he was unsure of where to begin.  He found himself having trouble concentrating lately, he was losing his mental sharpness.  His deepest kept secret as well was that his power was dissapearing as well.  Feats he could have completed easily, he found himself lacking now.  None of these things really bothered him however, it was the book that gnawed at his mind.  D’Jarvok did not have it, he had seen the Necromancer before he left on his errand, wherever that may be, and it was not in the tower where he stayed, Jonathan had searched that from the basement to the roof.  His power fading, he had to find that book, he knew the answers lay with its pages.  Turning back to his room, striding through the plainess of his surroundings, his mind whirled with plans of power and war, unable to to come to completion because of the missing pieces that lay out of his grasp.<br><br>Asmodeus awoke early the next morning.  He sat up in bed, a scream locked behind his lips, his eyes wide and unfocused.  His mind still reeled from the dream, in which the creature had unleashed the whip crack of power at him, back in Kithicor, what seemed like 100 years ago.  Staring at his room, it all came back to him.  The fight, hanging from the gate, the dash through Highpass, finding and taking the book, the journey back to Freeport.  He slowly laid back in his bed, his breath coming in shallow gasps, his eyes searching the room.  Throwing the covers off of his body, he stood and dressed, his robes draped over a chair near his bed.  Grasping the posts of the bed for support, he tested his legs.  Keeping his eyes fixed on the door ahead, he staggered forward, clutching the door frame and gasping from the effort.  As he grasped the doorknob, the visage of the creature flashed through his mind again.  He let loose with a shallow scream, and collapsed in a heap, the fear of the dead painted on his face.  Malak didn’t find him there until 2 hours later, and by then, the Wizard had collapsed back into unconciousness.  <br><br> - Chapter 11 -<br><br>The Goblin caves were cold and wet, and D’Jarvok was not happy to be spending as much time as he was in them.  He had been waiting for the Goblin King to see him for more than 4 hours, and his patience with this petty ruler was wearing thin.  He could have forced his way into the throne room by now, killing quite a few of them in the process, but he needed the willing support of the King and his army for the next step of his plans.  And so, here he was, forced to sit in this tiny room in a stone basement, awaiting the audience of some egotistical, green skinned little bastard with a crooked crown to allow him to speak before him.  It was enough to make D’Jarvok wish he had stayed in Highpass prison.<br><br>The Throne room of the Goblin king was larger than the room he had left behind, but no more dry or colorful.  The King sat on his throne, lackeys and soldiers surrounding him, metal crown crooked on top of his bald head.  His gut was enormous, his legs looked iron bars.  Everything about him suggested a walking bag of flesh with not intelligence, everything except his eyes.  The keen glint of animal intelligence was behind those eyes, and D’Jarvok paused a moment, perhaps underestimating this creature.  Striding forward, alone among them, he seemed incredibly tall and graceful, sword and dagger swinging from his belt, robes swirling around him.  He was stopped five feet in front of the throne, two of the larger soldiers crossing their rusty halbreds in his path, the King grunting for them to stop him.  Raising his hands in greeting, D’Jarvok quietly said, “Your Highness, I requested that we see each other in private audience.  I have a matter of some importance to speak with you about.”  “Ha, go back to your city if you will not talk to me here Wizard, I have no use for you here.”  D’Jarvok took the rebuke in stride, prepared for the stubborness of this midget ruler, “Will you not even hear my proposal?  I can promise at the least, destruction to your enemies and glory for your warriors.”  The King smiled, his eyes far off, “Do you think me so stupid that I don’t know about the defeat of Highpass and Rivervale?”  At the mention of Rivervale his eyes snapped up, “What do you mean Rivervale’s defeat!!”, the Necromancer again trying to force his way closer to the King.  “Ahhh, so you are not as well informed as you would have me think.  Rivervale was conquered yesterday by a sizable force, we think the same that took Highpass.  Perhaps they went off without you, ehhh?  Silly Dark Elf, go back to your toy soldiers in the forest and leave the real warriors to fight.  I have already joined forces with the leader of the army that overtook Rivervale, and it is with him that my clansmen and I shall fight.”  <br><br>Red fury, purple light, bloody explosions, silence.  For as long as he had been alive, D’Jarvok had always strived for more power than he had.  It had never been enough, and it probably never would be.  When he had obtained his book, he had thought that perhaps now he would get what he so richly deserved, but it was not to be.  He saw his own defeat now, plain before his face.  His own creation, his own blood spent in creation of a creature worthy to serve him, had stolen his own army from beneath him, and he had no way to get it back.  Despite their differences and bickering, there was one thing the Orcs, Gnolls, Undead, Dark Elves, all of them had in common, they would follow whomever led them to victory.  The defeat of Highpass was behind them, they were following the person who would help them the most at the current moment, and that was Jonathan.  How could D’Jarvok defeat Jonathan, this was the question.  He had the book, but it paled in comparison to Jonathan’s power, the embodiment of the Kiiraa blood magic.  He would have to find his book, perhaps the answers lay within it.  He doubted if Jonathan had found the book, perhaps was not even in Highpass any longer, but it didn’t matter.  Looking down at the torn remains of the Goblins, D’Jarvok clenched his hands into fists and strode from the chamber.  <br><br>- Chapter 12 -<br><br>Asmodeus knew about the Kiiraa of course.  Lying in this bed, washing between waking and sleeping, he had thought long and hard about that far gone race.  The Gods had found Norrath a long time, before time it seemed, and they had split the world up for their minions, Veeshan, Brell, Rallos Zek, Prexus, all of them had touched the land in some way.  Even Innoruuk and Cazic Thule had done their part to craft the land.  Asmodeus remembered when the Ogres were a mighty race, intelligent as they were strong, before the curse that brought them low and banished them to their swamps.  He remembered the Giants, when they were a powerful and mighty race, defeated and strewn across the land, hating all the other races forever.  The First King and Queen of the High Elves, killed by Innoruuk and used as the model for his race of Dark Elves.  The Frogloks, hiding in the swamps, slowly crafting an underground empire that would come to encompass two continents.  The Dragons, Trakanon, Nagafen, Vox, Gorenaire, the mighty winged lords of the land.  Veeshan’s Castle, hidden away, housing the libraries and creations of the Ring of Scale, the oldest brotherhood in the world.  Behind them all, under the world, hidden from everyone and everything, were the Kiiraa.  Ancient beings who had perfected Magic before the Elves and Dwarves had thought of using it, perfected war before the Ogres and Trolls first sharpened their swords.  They had used beings like Jonathan to guard their safehouses and castles, endowing their lowliest creations with enough power to take on a modern army.  They sat on their thrones like Demi-Gods, shaping the world to fit their needs.  The Towers strewn about the land, a mystery to most, thought to be some relic of the Combine Alliance, these were the portals used by the Kiiraa to come to the surface.  There had not been an event, a war, a time of peace, an invention, a spell created, a spell destroyed, a King raised, a Kingdom burned to the ground, in which they did not have a hand.  <br><br>All Ancient history of course.  They had been dead for more than 10,000 years.  The jealousy and greed inherent in all beings that powerful had finally gotten the best of them, and they had destroyed each other, most of the rest of the world never realizing they were even there.  The book however, that was something.  Detailed history of the race and its deeds, spells created by the Eldritch Masters of the collective, places where treasures of the Kings were hidden, all inside that tome.  Asmodeus knew he had to awake soon, decipher the language, find the weapons and armor, defeat Jonathan.  He knew D’Jarvok was no longer in charge, he knew it from the first time he saw the purple flash of light in Jonathan’s eyes.  He was so tired, so empty.  His hand felt foreign to him, not of his own body.  He did not know if he could defeat the thing that Jonathan had become, powerful beyond their knowledge.  Whatever happened, it had to be done quickly, and for that, Asmodeus was sorry.  <br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wabadoodles>Wabadoodles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/14/01 9:06:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=434.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   W00T!!!
