<br>
Any game that is build around making an item rare by boring most folks out of getting it is seriously flawed!!!  If you want tmake it a long quest (lots of steps), i fyou want to make it hard to figure out, or require killing a very HARD critter.  Fine.  That's GREAT by me.  <br>
<br>
But to make it require doing nothing for hours.  Or doing the same thing, over, and over, and over, and over and over (like Vox and Naggy for hte bard epic) that is just nuts.<br>
<br>
And the feel in DAoC is different.<br>
<br>
Lets take the bard epic as an example.  We go on a Naggy raid. There are 4 bards and say 8 warriors.  We all roll on the scale.  Maybe there is some bickering or in fighting, maybe the leader has reserved said scale and so no one will go on his raid, the list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
Lets drop the same quest into DAoC.  You STILL have to take out a mob that was very &quot;end game&quot; when the game was released.  You STILL need the people, the preperation etc.  But in DAoC EVERY one of those bards and warriors gets the quest peice they need. No need to spend months (or more) killing that same creature over and over again with no garuntee of EVER getting the piece yo need for you're quest.  No bickering over who gets the loot, no line, no fighting, no bitterness.   Everyone who has the quest gets the item.   (its placed directly into their inventory by the game. So no ninga looting by accident or purpose either!)<br>
<br>
I experienced this my second night in DAoC.  I got a quest that required killing a certain critter and brining back proof.  Ended up with like 4 folks who had teh quest.  (myself and one other in our part and two folks who showed up at the kiling psot)  I immediately got bristly when they showed up. But they joined the grouped and I was reminded this WASN'T EQ.  There would be no lines. There would be no KSing, there were be no anger toward one another.<br>
<br>
We sat around like civlized folks. We enjoyed one another's company.  We killed the critter, we all got the piece.  I had a sort of epiphany.  It had been FUN! We'd all cooperated. We'd gotten something done and it had been FUN!  Brand new concept in quests for me.  I thought about those uncountable Vox and Naggy raids, I htoughta bout the reservation system, the jealously, the ninja looting... And I smiled, retired my EQ bard in that instant and went on with enjoying a game. :)<br>
<br>
What does it matter what the &quot;value&quot; of an item is?  This isn't a competition.  The goal is to be well enough equiped to be able to function well.  I need to have good enough armor to defend the casters in my group.  I need to have a good enough sword to help kill the creature.  But I don't care if everyone else has as good a sword!   <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn

<br>
Players are consuming the content at a phenomenal rate. As demented as this sounds, I kind of hope leveling does &quot;slow down&quot; a bit past 30. In a weeks time, I'm reading of people already eclipsing this level. Heck in my guild of mostly working 9-5ers we have 8+ nearing 30 and will most likely be past there by the week's end. Tradeskill people already nearing the 400s (don't know what the cap is, but dang that's high).<br>
<br>
Sure reduced downtime does lead to faster leveling, but it seems like people were so starved for &quot;something different from EQ yet similar&quot; that they are going full-bore eating the game up.<br>
<br>
For this reason I'm weary. Biggest con I've read in regards to DAoC is lack of content, and people equating it to the smaller set of content EQ had at it's launch. But we're dealing with a different breed of players now. Players who now know what combinations, tactics and tricks yield the fastest results and I don't feel DAoC is vastly different enough from EQ to keep them guessing long. Combine this with the almost frenzied behavior I'm seeing and the world of Camelot is getting smaller by the minute in my book.<br>
<br>
RvR better be *extremely* enticing to keep people's interest otherwise there going to be a lot of bored people...soon.<br>

Its painfully obvious how repetetive mmorpg's are(is DAoC not going to be repetetive at some point?), and like i stated before, every minute isnt fun.  You chose to sit on your ass to med up to full over and over again to reach that next lvl to hit lvl 50+.  My question is what motivated you to do it?  What motivates somebody to get their epic?  Why are they willing to go through all that repetetiveness, constant camp checking, and foraging for hours upon end to accomlish this?  I dont buy the argument the epic quests are easy, nor do i think anybody that recieved their epic got it 'easy'.  They put time(=work), a good deal of boring time into accomplishing that.  That boring time is what deterred me from even attempting it.  Its what makes it rare and more of an accomplishment for you on your end.  In a general sense(not just gaming), if accomplishing everything was fun all the way through would the reward feel like that much of an accomplishment?  Theres nothing like reaching a goal through hard work or tough times(basically through stuff thats not fun).  <br>
<br>
As for increasing the difficulty(in a fun sense), i think the problem with that is when you have an AI, then players will eventually be able to conquer that AI after so many tries.  Sooner or later the players will all have accomplished what was supposed to be a longterm goal in a short span.  I mean what really is 'difficult' in EQ?  Couldnt you pretty much beat any mob in the game considering you have the resources(people) to do it with as many tries as you want?  So they put in buffers, boring buffers so people have to 'work' at those attempts.  I'm sure it is difficult to a degree, but there is alot of boredom involved so everybody isnt in there trying to do it every night, and that accomplishment isnt being accomplished by everybody.  Downtime is a buffer to slow down the rate at which people accomplish things, and even with the amount of downtime EQ has, Verant still has a hard time keeping content in the game thats fresh for people to work towards.  <br>
<br>
Maybe its how we're defining boredom.  I define boredom as monotony, downtime, and basically anything thats not really fun(obviously).  Foraging is boring, and so are raising skills.  I find it hard to believe that anybody could consider this fun since all your doing is pressing the same buttons over and over again without any thinking.  There are aton of things that arent fun, nor are difficult, but people are willing to do it and are proud in the end for accomplishing it.  MMorpg's have alot of this in them just because they are long-term games(persistant worlds) for the most part.  When you say DAoC is for the casual player, thats fine, but there had better be a long-term goal in there somewhere or people will become bored with it fast.  And even though alot of you casual players are all for less 'work' towards everything, you might find that accomplishments dont have the same feel as they did in EQ.  For example reaching lvl 50 in DAoC probably wont have the same feeling as reaching it in EQ, especially when its 'easy' and everybody is lvl 50.  I hate to keep bringing up AO, but it seems DAoC parallels AO in alot of ways from what i've read.  It was 'supposed' to be for the casual gamer but i think that was part of its problem.  Everything seemed too easy, and there just wasnt enough content in the game for how fast players were moving before they wanted something different to do.  <br>
<br>
I dont disagree with the premise that games 'should' be fun and not work.  However, i think that human nature says otherwise because people want to feel a lvl of satisfaction for accomplishing certain things.  Based on how much 'work' went into that, the higher the degree of satisfaction is.  Maybe a game can come out that is truly challenging without having to use boredom(downtime, monotony, etc) as part of the challenge.  Personally, i just dont see an AI being that good where monotony isnt a factor, nor do i see the mechanics for somethign that truly takes skill only a few have, to accomplish a challenge that only the most 'skilled' are supposed to be able to do.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(10/17/01 11:21:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .......</span><hr size=1> Broomhilda says:  <b><i>I define boredom as monotony, downtime, and basically anything thats not really fun(obviously).</b></i><br>

Funny, sounds like a good definition of most of Everquest. ;P<br>
<br>
<b><i>When you say DAoC is for the casual player, thats fine, but there had better be a long-term goal in there somewhere or people will become bored with it fast.</b></i><br>
<br>
Correct.  But the point is that a "long-term" goal doesn't have to involve monotonous activity or 99% downtime.  I don't know about you, but when I see a game activity that involves 8 hours of downtime and 2 minutes of play time, I value it as a 2 minute experience, not an 8 hour and 2 minute experience.  Perhaps you're just easily fooled into believing that sitting on your butt is a worthwhile experience.  :)<br>
<br>
<b><i>Based on how much 'work' went into that, the higher the degree of satisfaction is.</b></i><br>
<br>
I already have a job.  I don't want more "work"; especially not the super-tedious form of Everquest "work" that makes even the most menial labor look like exciting stuff.  I want entertainment.  Like I said, as soon as SOE starts paying me a salary, I'll consider it as employment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utandaina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tandaina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(10/17/01 11:53:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .......</span><hr size=1> agreed Tudamorf.<br>
<br>
And who says its a problem that users are &quot;eating up the content.&quot; Most games have a shelf life.  You do the game, you finish it to you're satisfaction, and you move on to something else.<br>
<br>
EQ has created this idea in our minds that a game must be able to keep us occupied for 2 years or more! Before MMORPGs that was unheard of! No one expected their game to be on the shelves that long. By the time a game was 2 years  old it was in teh bargain bin!<br>
<br>
Some folks will &quot;finish&quot; the game faster than others.  I'll be a slow one cause I can't play much. But I like that I CAN finish the game without it turning into a boring job.<br>
<br>
What does it matter if once someone figures out how to kill a mob it can be done again?  Games are meant to be completed.  You're MEANT to figure them out, and move on! Heh.  <br>
<br>
(Oh and trade skill cap is I belive 1,000) So 400 is like reaching say 100 in EQ.  EASY.  Its getting it that last stretch that's hard. As any level 158 EQ tailor. ;)<br>
<br>
I started armor crafting last night.  What a change form EQ!!!!! My druid in EQ is a master in ever craft in the game.  Though she burned out on tailoring (one of the things that put a stake in the game for me.).  Crafting is so well put togheter and thought out.  I didnt' have to guess at recipies. I didn't have to clikc a thousand times and I didn't have to go broke just moving my skills one or two levels. <br>
<br>
Instead my craft master gave me tasks &quot;make gloves for this npc, make a pair of boots for this one, etc.&quot;  I made them one at a time and delivered them for a fee.  I ended up breaking even at he end of the night.  Now I won't level fast with this method but it means that anyone willing ot invest the time can get heir skills up.  You don't have to havea  ton of money to throw at it.  (And no more camping greenies! Yeah!) ;)<br>
<br>
And I think we need to adjust our view points.  DAoC is NOT meant for the high end uber-only-power-gamers type end game EQ has.  Instead it is focused on RvR conflict.  Protect your own realm's powerful relics and try to steal other realm's.  (and take land too)  THAT is where you're high end content is. And THAT is where the playability will outlast most old MMORPGs.  Because you can't just figure out how to do it like was done with naggy long ago.  <br>
<br>
While one strategy might work the first time your enemy will learn.  If you try the same thing again not only will they be ready they'll probably have some nasty little surprise for you to go along with it!  What we're seeing now is the low end content.  Its purpose is to get us used to working togther.  And to get us of a level where we can take part in the RvR battles.  I've talke dto beta testers who say you CAN level fast.  Its meant to be that way so you can level up on the boring hack and slash stuff quickly (although you can also level on quests) and then go out and have fun RvRing. :) <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

Since PvP isnt as monotonous and predictable as an AI for obvious reasons.  The only thing i'll say in regards to PvP is that the mechanics better work well or its screwed, especially when so much hinges on it as somebody mentioned above.  AO  being a perfect example.  EQ PvP wasnt a success imo either.  In fact the only successful PvP system so far has been in UO imo, and thats entirely different than these 1st person  mmorpg's.  The group PvP system is a nice idea, something EQ could even do if they were willing.  The only downside is it seems there is are alot of people that dont really want to participate in PvP, but would rather have a high end AI system.  It'd be nice if they could do both but i'll wait to see if theyre willing to do it.  <br>
<br>
Doom, Quake, etc's success cant be compared to the way 1st person mmorpg's go about PvP because the mechanics are entirely different.  It seems these 1st person mmorpg's dont want to change the mechanics too much anyways, since EQ, AO, and apparently DAoC's mechanics are pretty much the same.  The only thing changing is the systems, like Realms or storylines.

I was leery about the RvR at first but my guild (most of them beta tested) have convinced me I&quot;ll enjoy it. :)  No once and take anything from me.  And I don't ahve to do a CR in enemy territory. I just release with no penalties.  <br>
<br>
Also, no one can come into MY realm and kill me.  PvP is in the frontiers only.  So I can choose to participate or not.  Since you can not bind in an unsafe location, no one can camp you're bind spot.  These were all my concerns and they seem to have been addressed.  As in all hunting in DAoC I can go have a heart pounding adventure with no fear of loss of equipment.  :)<br>
<br>
We'll see. :) To be honest I dn't care about high end PvE content.   The high end EQ game never appealed to me in the least.  So I won't miss it on DAoC one bit.  <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

I bought EQ on release day and played it for approx. 2 years.  Leveled my druid up to 52 and about 4 others into there 40’s(and probably 4 more, 40 or less).  During that time I also played AC on and off a bit, got a character up in the high 30’s (got into the last stage of beta).  It was a change every now and then from EQ, but nothing awesome.  I canceled my EQ account before AO came out, It just got to the point that I was not having fun anymore (the post 50 game never really appealed to me much).  I never badmouthed EQ, I never really had any problems with their Customer Service, and I just got tired of the game plain and simple.  Every now and then I check the boards here just to see what’s going on in game (been here more frequently since the DAOC board opened up).  I did get into AO beta and leveled a character up to mid 30’s. I played it for a couple of months after release.  The game has beautiful graphics and I had hoped for a much better gaming experience.  I never really had many problems with running AO like a lot of people did the game just got old really fast &amp;#61516;.  <br>
<br>
Now I am playing DAOC.  I did get a character up to 19 in beta.  I am having feelings that I haven’t felt since the early days of EQ.  I can’t wait to play.  I play every chance I get (the servers are down now, that is why I’m trolling the boards) I play in the morning, I play during lunch, I play in the evening.  I really don’t see how someone could be disappointed with this game.   Now maybe in about 6 months I might start to get tired of it (Including beta I have been playing for about 2.5 months), I just can’t say.<br>
<br>
If you are still having fun with EQ and on a limited budget then I would say keep on playing EQ.  Play EQ until you just can’t play it anymore, it is a great game!  Don’t feel like you have to play the next great game because everyone else is.  When you get to the point that EQ is no longer fun then play DAOC (unless you play EQ until another great game comes out).<br>
<br>
One thing for sure DAOC is no AO you do not have to worry about that.  DAOC in my opinion is a great game.  I am having just as much fun if not more then I did in the early days of EQ.  It is similar to EQ but not too similar, just enough to keep me playing.  Plus the game has a lot of time to grow and mature (not that it needs it), but a lot of time to add more content.  <br>

<br>
Can't really agree with that. MMORPGs have never been &quot;normal&quot; games that cycle through the software section in three months. I still see boxes for UO, EQ and AC on the shelves to this day (yes even the lonely AO box too).<br>
<br>
Given their costly and slow development: either high profile marketing to constantly bring in fresh players or retention of current players for next months CC debit give them any chance of ever breaking even, let alone turning a profit. Usually it's the latter, retaining the subscriber.<br>

Subscriptions are their lifeblood. It's easier to keep a subscriber than it is to go out and find one. Very much like the old sayings &quot;'a penny saved is a penny earned&quot; and &quot;it's easier to save a penny (and let it earn more for you) than it is to spend that penny and re-earn it back&quot;. Just throw in &quot;your subscriber&quot;, &quot;your subscriber's monthly fee&quot;, etc. where appropriate.<br>
<br>
This is what every retail MMORPG hopes for. Even Meridian 59 released in Fall '96 did not turn off their servers until nearly 4 years later in late '00...raking in subscriptions the whole time. MMORPGs just are *not* developed for the short term like a stand alone game. The developers *wants* to retain their subscribers...it's the path of least resistance (and highest return).<br>
<br>
However, I will say that what I'm seeing with the &quot;fast consumed content&quot; is skewed. A lot of my guildmates were beta testers throughout several phases. I was not. They know the ins-and-outs, have a immense depth of knowledge and have naturally taken off. I of course...was somewhat bewildered 'till I thought about it heh.<br>

<br>
I agree with this statement.  I have noticed that the gameplay is indeed more practical and functional.  Many of the interface driven frustrations of EQ are gone.  Much of the PvE leveling frustrations are gone.  <br>
<br>
I have noticed that as you level, monsters get smarter and have more tactics.  It almost seems to me that DaoC is teaching us steadily to expect more and more from the monsters.  Hmmm, preparing us for RvR? <br>
<br>
I have noticed that interacting with other players, as in the sharing quest example above, tends to build bonds of friendship.  Tradeskilled items are actually valuable to other players.  More exp from grouping than from soloing. Auto split loot, you don't have to "grab your share".  It's actually FUN to play with other folks in your realm!  Hmmm, building bonds of loyalty for RvR?<br>
<br>
Many of us who previously eschewed PvP did so as a result of painful memories of being ganked and taunted.  Some jerk catches you at 10% health after having just killed a monster.  PvPer shouts to zone "I just killed SoAndSo, what a wuss!"  Even worse are the taunting tells, "thanks for the x piece of equipment, I'll use it to kill your friends".  Finally your beloved characters name rides in his bio as a "kill" for the remainder of your game experience. NOT FUN.<br>
<br>
In DaoC, you can't TALK to the other realm players.  You can't track names of people in other realms, you only see the class and level of the character you fighting.  That's it.   No taunting at all, you just got killed by a dang smart troll, elf, what have you.   No pain from having your corpse looted.  No lost experience.  Instead, it's time to rethink your strategy and give it another go.  We get to focus on fun, excitement and strategy instead of being hindered by fears of being personally humiliated, losing exp, or losing items.<br>
<br>
I think these factors are brilliant on the part of Mythic.  I am excited about PvP for the first time in years!  <br>

<br>
One of the dumbest aspect of EQ was the massive downtime.  The objective is clear, and it's not a bad one...keep the player from "finishing" the game quickly so the subscription money keeps rolling in.<br>
<br>
There are many ways of doing this.  One is to provide a setting for a community.  EQ did that, very well.  DAoC does it better in my opinion because the relationships between players in a realm is less adversarial than in EQ.  There are more "resources" in the PvE arena so there isn't massive overcrowding.<br>
<br>
The other that EQ choose was to make leveling and gaining items so mindnumbingly tedious and slow to pose "a challenge".  <br>
<br>
Which is probably the dumbest thing that a flat rate game provider can do.  In the old AOL days where each minute of connect time = more revenue, you could do this and as long as your player population went along with it make more money.  On a flat rate system, each minute of connect time = lost profit.  <br>
<br>
In an optimal world, you have 300,000 subscribers that never log in...so you can dump them all on a 486 pc with a 28.8 modem.<br>
<br>
The better way of doing it would have been to put in checks and balances to slow growth but do so in a manner than didn't require the player to be online or at least online in a less resource intensive manner.  <br>
<br>
An example would be downtime...you could do it the EQ way and make a exceedingly boring system.  Or you could set it up that every 4-6 hours of game play, you need to rest in a city for an hour (lounging, working trade skills, roleplaying, whatever) or log off for 4+ hours.  If you don't fatigue doesn't regenerate.<br>
<br>
Then make the combat fast and furious with less downtime.  Same mobs killed over time.  Same time to 50.  Only you give an incentive to log out and stop burning resources (profit) or move to an underused city zone that can handle a higher density of players (since fewer mobs) and a bit of lag is no big deal.<br>
<br>
For powerlevelers who NEED to be playing 16 hours straight, they have to get at least an alternate account to play for that 4 hour dead period...so at the least they'd be paying double than the casual players.<br>
<br>
You can do the same for trade skills.  Why have accounts be logged in and burning bandwidth and cpu cycles in Tir doing tradeskills if you can get them to set up a job that says "burn all my money powerskilling armorcraft" and charging an extra $1/hour that account is spent OFFLINE and working skills.<br>
<br>
The limitations to it getting out of hand is how much they're willing to spend for connect time and the fact that you can't do consignments so you're money limited.<br>

<br>
I think the goal with DAOC is to have PvP <b>BE</b> the high end AI, or at least one of them.  There is no discussion or cooperation with the enemy, so the enemy is really just another NPC with highly adaptive attack and defense subroutines, and the frontiers are really just another dungeon with that enemy.  As SunnySky1 points out, the usual things that drive people away from PvP (ganking, d00d taunting, looting) don't exist.<br>
<br>
If Mythic is was smart as I hope, they also created a bunch of predictable dragon-equivalent encounters for the Everquest wimps (in safe dungeon areas), giving the player the best of both worlds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(10/18/01 4:03:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.truepath.com/jadae/Blue.JPG width=102 height=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .....</span><hr size=1> &quot;I have noticed that as you level, monsters get smarter and have more tactics.

Well I played EQ in beta 4, and ended up with a 55 druid, 52 enchanter and 40 mage.  I also took some long breaks from EQ.  I am playing DAoC and it is *much* more enjoyable.   <br>
  Mythic will continue to tweak some classes, so you may or may not want to wait.  Interestingly they modified the rogue class and they *added* choices (which upset a few people, as they now had additional things to spend their skill points on, but they had spent them on other things).  Compare this to EQ, I remember Verant nerfing lots, and lots and lots, removing choices, abilities, etc.  <br>
 Also if something bad happens in DAoC, yes you loose experince, but no annoying corpse recovery.  If you can get rezed or if you get back to your tomb stone, you get half your exp back.  A penality, but not drastic.  <br>
 So far it is a much, much, much better game than EQ.<br>
