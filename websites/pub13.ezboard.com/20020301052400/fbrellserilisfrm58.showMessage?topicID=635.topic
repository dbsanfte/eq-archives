If you do it properly, it should be a positive experience on a bunch of levels.  <br><br>First, it's a reality in life that many rewards are based on performance, and this can be a really important motivator for certain people in certain situations.  It is not always enough to do something well just for the self-satisfaction of having done it well.  If all motivation came down to that, people would learn that if they don't find something satisfying, they may as well abdicate responsibility for doing it.  As important as it is to teach someone to have pride and do well for their own sake, it's also important to teach them that there are rewards for excelling at tasks we don't like, or in which we do not see intrinsic value.  We do not always find ourselves in our ideal careers or in our ideal circumstances of self-realization.  I would not have come to work this morning if they weren't paying me, but sometimes we have to do what must be done.  Ideally, I would want my kids to feel connected to the labour/reward process so they learn to have a vested interest in not being lazy, rather than a vague moral sense that they shouldn't be.<br><br>But secondly, and more importantly, I think the financial reward, if you're enthusiastic about it, is a great vehicle for showing you're involved and interested in what they're doing, and that their success inspires your praise, generosity, and reward all at the same time.  If the process becomes a formality, where you count up the X's and grudgingly hand over the cash, then it'll totally fail to be a positive experience, but if you can get across that magic sense that you care, and that because you're proud you're happy to keep your generous side of the bargain, you've rolled praise and positive reinforcement (which helps teach to take pride in good work), and a sense that working at something inspires reward and generosity (which helps teach not to be lazy when pride alone isn't enough--for example, in situations where posting on message boards seems more worthwhile than doing what I'm paid for) all into one.<br><br>My parents never gave me any financial reward for my report cards, either, but from what I can remember, they tended to buy me things, rather than give me the money to buy them myself, so if they wanted to reward me for something like a report card, they'd probably have done it in a less measurable fashion than you've described above.  Anyway, there's lots of ways to teach the same lessons.  This one just seems as good as many alternatives.<br><br>Khoren Stonefall<br>Level 60 Crusader of Marr<br>Silent Redemption <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unasteratuofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nasteratu of Brell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>P'diddy's man servant</span><br>  Posts: 833<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/02 8:43:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Getting paid for grades</span><hr size=1> I agree w/ Khoren, the paying for grades system worked for me. Its just how you set it up, set a limit like X$ for a B and 2X$ for an A, nothing for a C because C is average and you are paying for above average work. Along with teaching kids the reward for work it can also teach them how to spend and budget their money. Insted of buying them somthing just tell them to save the money that they earned from their grades. This will encourage not only saving money but also getting better grades to recieve more money so they can attain their desired item faster. <p><p align=center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55580"><img src="http://home.nycap.rr.com/azire/nasteratu.jpg"></a><BR><i>(un)</i>Retired 60 Slackromancer of Brell<br><b>The perfect compliment to your cleric</b><br><b><a href="http:\\www.legionofheroes.org">Legion of Heroes</a></b><BR></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubloohsugah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BloohSugah</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://blooh.5u.com/u032.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I DEMAND!<br>I'm a little demander!</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/31/02 10:30:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Getting paid for grades</span><hr size=1> My kids get to pick out a toy if they &quot;get a good report&quot;.<br><br>Of course, they always get a &quot;good report&quot;, and I have no idea at what point I would consider it a bad one.  lol.<br><br>But, for example, my 3rd grader is a sloppy writer.

If you combine this with other life lessons, then it'll be really good for your kids.<br><br>I know for one that I seriously, desperately wish my parents had been better about teaching my brother and I about money and effort vs. reward. While they did a good job about teaching us values like friendship, honesty, generosity and other things, they totally missed the boat on motivation and money. Both my brother and are adults, but neither of us has the slightest clue on how to manage money.

Being a hairdressier, I speak to a LOT of women and grandparents.  While I find its more the grandparents doing this, some parents do this too.  Personally I dont think children should be paid for good grades.  This is something they should do because they take pride in themselves. <br><br> I equate it to responsibility.  Ok you guys are going to rant me about this, but I dont believe in paying our children for helping out around the house.   My job is work, cook and do most of the cleaning.  Same with my spouse.  The children have thier jobs to do.  We all pitch in to help each other because thats what family is about.  Its not about what we can get out of each other.  Paying a child to help around the house is obsurd.  Allowance bah.  I wouldnt pay my husband for stuff he does why should I pay my children. <br><br>Now your all gonna jump on the band wagon about teaching the value of money.  How are they going to learn to earn things.  That money does not grow on trees and when its gone oh well you spent it.<br><br>I think family values are more important than money.  That as a family we all work together to make our lives easier.  When the child is a teenager there are part time jobs they can get.  This is when the child learns the value of a dollar.  <br><br>Ya know somewhere along the way the old values of family unity has been lost.  The Orientals really have a stronge sense of family.  What it means to be family. We Americans stick our parents in homes when they get old.  We pay our children for things that should just be understood that, thats what you do because you are a member of this family.<br><br>Well thats my 2 pp worth.<br><br>Morgania.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvoide.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Voide</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/1/02 6:24:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmmm...</span><hr size=1> As a child that just completed high school, and is continuing college, let me see if I can share some knowledge.<br><br>I graduated high school with a 2.7 overall GPA, as an extremely unmotivated student.

However, I do not know your children Wende, they might be very motivated to do well already, and you are just trying to bolster their esteem, so I will speak from my own experience.<br><br>If they are unmotivated, like myself, no amount of bribes or treats is going to get them going again.  External motivation will not work on an unmotivated child, they need to be internally motivated themselves.  If this is the case, just try opening up their eyes to the big picture of life, i.e. getting good grades usually helps you get into a good college and get a good job for the most part. Other than that, there is not really much you can do to instill internal motivation in a child, as it is hard to come by.<br><br>In summary, if they are all ready motivated, pay then all you want! If they are not motivated, try to show them what happens when they aren't! I'm sure we all know someone that had big plans for life and then got them ruined by poor grades.

Look at real life work. If everyone got a $1 an hour raise would you see anyone be more productive. Maybe a few but not all. The best way in my idea is to sit down and ask your child what they would like and develop a plan with them. Say a young child might really want a better bike. So you draw up a contract on what needs to be done to get it. Something that brings enjoyment that you got on your own gives you more a sense of pride(depending on the child)  Although I think I would base big items on more than one report card. In the end you will have to tailor your plan that best suits your child. I like one of the posters sat around and did nothing in math and would ace every test. The guy beside me did all his homework and got Fs. So if your child is getting Ds then alter it and say if you get a 2.6. Once they get to that level raise them to the next. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uminutemanaslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Minute Manaslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ASSIST DAMMIT!!!</span><br>  Posts: 1527<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/2/02 10:16:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=635.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmmm...</span><hr size=1> It doesn't necessarily need to be money though.
