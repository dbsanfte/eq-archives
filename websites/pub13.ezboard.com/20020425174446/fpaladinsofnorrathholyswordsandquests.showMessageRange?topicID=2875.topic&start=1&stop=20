I went thru the motions, but you can start it at Seafares Roost, by the docks in East Freeport.  I read you mentioned being KOS, this may be a problem.  Anyway, go to Seafares, between 1-3am (EQ time) and a zombie like NPC named Tyklar(sp) will spawn.  You will need to purchase and give Tyklar 4 Droms Champagne (Lore Item) one at a time.  (Note: I was only able to purchase from the female bar keep, male barkeep called me a scumbag and told me to be gone).  After giving Tyklar the fourth champagne he will give you a &quot;blanket&quot;.  You will then take this blanket, edible goo and bog juice to Zimel, who is in the prison under the arena in freeport. Zimel will give you a key &quot;HK 102&quot;, which you will neen to give to the banker in Highkeep, who will in turn give you the note for Brother Hayle.<br><br>If this confuses you, look under the Info and Guides section on the main page of PON.  There is a complete step by step guide to the Soulfire. <p><p><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~montielj/hand/Karpaz.htm">Sir Karpaz D'Mingus</a><br>41st Knight of Tunare<br>Towers of Elysium<br>Saryrn</p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukaldaasdei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaldaas DeI</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/18/01 4:20:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2875.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kaldaasdei.tripod.com/Kaldaas45.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help with SF</span><hr size=1> Here's a sum-up for the quest, and it only includes the things that you MUST do:<br><br>1) Venture to Mistmoore and kill Xicotl, a level 35ish Troll Shadowknight. He spawns within the castle, in the spa room. His placeholder is a Mistmoore Guard, and the spawn is about 20 minutes.<br><br>2) Venture to Merko Quetalis at the Hall of Truth in North Freeport. He will give you the Testimony quest. Go to EC, and give Altunic Jartin (in hut near the WC zone, wanders) a regular cloth shirt (can be store-bought). This should spawn Squire Narl. Wax Narl and give his head to Altunic. Altunic will give you one token. Go to North Ro, and kill spiders until you get a spider venom sac. It shouldn't take many kills. Take the sac to Merko in Freeport and he will give you another token. Hand both of these into him, and a spy will spawn in the sewer right near him. Go kill the guard, and try and be SoWed. This spy has high MR, so it will take a few roots. Loot the token off of them, and give it to Merko for your Testimony.<br><br>3) Acquire the components for Edible Goo and Bog Juice in Freeport. You need snake scales and a pod of water for the juice if I remember correctly, and rat ears and a fire beetle eye for the goo. These can be made in a few shots with 0 skill. Then, go to Freeport and wait at the Seafarer's Roost for Tykar Renlin. He looks like a madman. Hand him 4 Drom's Champagnes. These are lore. He despawns quickly, so be sure to have one on your cursor for when he spawns. These can usually only be bought from the female vendor, for the other guy hates most others. After you give Tykar 4 champagnes, he gives you a blanket. Take the goo, blanket, and juice to Zimel (known as 'a prisoner') in the cells below the Arena in West FP. He will give you H.K. key 102. Take this to the female banker in Highkeep, and she will give you a note to take to Hayle. Take this note to Hayle in the jails in Paw, and he will give you another note. Save this one.<br><br>4) Venture to West Freeport (again). The villain you seek is Sir Lucan. To kill him:<br>A) Have someone run into the Militia house, smack him, and zone straight into EC.<br>B) Have someone non-KOS hail him until his guards and Brother Jentry are gone.<br>C) Pull him to your camp. This should be set up near Ping's tent, or in the ballroom in the sewers on the way to North Freeport.<br>D) To dispatch him, you should have at least a single party of 40-50s, if not two or more. Levels are negotiable. The higher levels you get, the better chance of success. After his live form is killed, a skeleton version spawns, which is ~30. Kill this, and loot the testimony from his corpse. Take this testimony to Valeron Dushire in North Freeport at the Hall of Truth, and receive your Brilliant Sword of Faith. <br><br>5) Gather up your things (hilt, testimony of truth, brilliant sword of faith, note) and take them to Hayle in Paw. To open his cell, there are a couple levers a few steps from the cell door. Flip both of them, and make sure you have someone stay outside to open the cell for you when you're ready to leave. Hand in all of these components to Hayle (hilt, testimony of truth, brilliant sword of faith, note), and receive your Soulfire! <br><br>*IMPORTANT NOTE* Your faction MUST be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  at least</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Kindly to the Rodcet Nife Paladin/Cleric guild in Qeynos. To do this, have a friend of yours create a newbie SK. Take this SK to the pool with the UFO in Qeynos. Once a Koalindl fish spawns, have them HT it and melee it. Group with them, but do NOT heal them or help melee the fish. Loot the fish once it is dead. Hand it in to Enik Ruklin (wanders near or swims in the pool) and you'll get great faction. Just keep repeating this, and avoid waiting by just having the SK attack Enik and get killed. Get them bound right near the pool if you can. You must be at least amiably to the guild for this to work in the first place. You can reach amiable faction by handing in bone chips/gold to Lashun Novashine. He wanders in the newbie grounds near Qeynos Hills. Once you're kindly, head off to Paw! <p>Kaldaas<br>46th Paladin<br>Divide et Impera<br>Bristlebane Server<br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukaldaasdei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaldaas DeI</A> at: 3/18/01 4:24:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulumaden69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lumaden69</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/18/01 4:54:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2875.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help with SF</span><hr size=1> Well done Kaldaas thank you <p><center><FONT color="56A9D1">Lumaden Dragonrider</FONT></center><br><center>52 Cavalier</center><br><center><FONT color="A33E6A">Officer ~~Vis Veres~~</FONT></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uekimemsti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ekimemsti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/01 10:58:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2875.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/ekimemstiestervon/c_paladin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help with SF</span><hr size=1> couple small things I noticed when doing the early<br>stage of the quest.
