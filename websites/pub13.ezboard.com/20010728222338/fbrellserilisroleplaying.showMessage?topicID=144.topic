A small assembly sat on wooden seats, elevated from the crowd by a large platform. A half dome had been built around the platform, to focus the volume of the speakers to the people below. There, standing in the front of the mass, was a small form of neatly dressed cadets, the females wearing long, white silken dresses with blue ribbons tied around thier waist. The males were dressed less extravagant, wearing white silk jerkins and long blue breeches, but still retained the aura of purity and finesse.<br>
<br>
The city had been rebuilt over the past few months, and the High Elves had been recruiting hundreds of new, young males and females to fill the ranks of the lost. This was a glorious moment, as the first squad of youngsters was about to become true paladins.<br>
General Jyleel and two of his aides walked up to the front of the platform, Jyleel taking another step forward.<br>
&quot;People of Felwithe, Children of the Mother, friends and family members alike, we are here to witness the Mother's inception of new warriors, proud and true, into her ranks of worthy Paladins.&quot; he began.<br>
<br>
The speech droned on and on, and seemed to have no end.<br>
&quot;You know,&quot; Fenye muttered, &quot;I always thought that you could never kill a person with boredom. The fact that I am still here alive is a testament to that.&quot;<br>
The snickering of her nearby friends caught the eye of one of Jyleel's aide, who shot an icy glare to the young elves.<br>
<br>
Finally, it was time for the ceremony, and the bards of Kelethin began to play thier instruments with grace and fluidity. The young cadets began to file themselves up on the platform in a single file line, and one by one, they walked up to Jyleel. He raised his Holy Sword, and tapped each cadet on his or her shoulder, and said a prayer to Tunare, and with each cadet, the Divine Light of Tunare shone from the heavens to touch the young one, marking them as a Paladin from that day on.<br>
Now it was Fenye's turn. Nervous, she walked towards Jyleel, but his warm smile reassured herself that nothing would go wrong. But strangely, all the voices seemed to be dulled out, and his own words were uncomprehensable. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fenye! Wake up!&quot; shouted one of her bunkmates from the academy. She had overslept again. The anxiety of gradutating was overwhelming, and she only had two weeks until it was time. But today was going to be like any other, just more vigorous training and mental games to keep the mind sharp.<br>
<br>
Running half dressed and unbathed to the fields, Fenye caught up with the rest of the troop. <br>
&quot;Today you will embark on your first mission. For each of you it will be different, and for each of you it will be a quest, a test of your worth. I will not see you again until it is time for you to graduate, and you will not graduate until your test is proven.<br>
&quot;I am also not going to tell you what your quest is. You will find it. If Tunare is truly with you, she will guide you to your quest.&quot; With a smile he turned his back, and headed into the barracks, leaving the cadets dumbfounded.<br>
Fenye stood there, rubbing her eyes in disbelief. But smiling, she knew she could (and probably should) rest a bit before opening her mind to let Tunare show her the path she was to follow.<br>
Crawling back into her soft hay mattress, she drifted off to sleep..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The songs of birds and the annoyance of insects brought Fenye from her slumber, and the sun shining high in the sky told her it was around midday. The young cadets had run off to various parts of the Faydarks to &quot;find&quot; thier quests, some traveled further, as a few of the horses were missing.<br>
<br>
The high pitched whining of a wisp was faintly heard from just outside her bunk, with the pitter-patter of little feet. Lazily sitting up in bed Fenye saw a short blonde girl with thick curly lops of hair bouncing off her shoulders as she chased the fleeing wisp with open palms.<br>
It was Werane's younger sister, Lillith. Fenye had enjoyed playing with her pet wisp from time to time, and on many occasions the wisp had gotten free of Lilliths' hands and tried to flee into the wilderness, but each time somehow the tiny young girl managed to capture it and bring it back.<br>
Smiling and folding her hands behind her back, it seemed like a good time to make a trip to Kelethin and visit Werane's family before she set off on her own quest.<br>
<br>
Hours later, the treetop village of Kelethin came into view. The travel pack had worn a sore spot on her shoulders, and her feet ached from the bard's song - she was not used to running so fast and for so long. A few gold pieces and the bard was on his way, and the guards smiled warmly upon her as she stepped onto the lift that would take her to the platforms high up in the trees.<br>
<br>
Werane's house was a tiny one, a small hut with one main room and four cots folded up on the walls like shelves. A cooking pot and fire pit dominated the center of the room, and various wooden toys scattered across the floor from Lillith's last playtime.<br>
&quot;Messy kid,&quot; said Fenye to herself, picking up a few of them and placing them in a small toy box. There were small wooden carvings of Werane and her sister, and some of Werane and Fenye. Her parents had long since traveled to Kaladim to trade thier animal furs with the dwarves. Furs were highly sought after by dwarves as insulation and padding to fit underneath thier heavy plate armor. Although they lived in such a small hut, thier family was well set financially, and had Lillith in the best of schooling.<br>
But a sudden thump outside the door startled Fenye.<br>
<br>
The stank of alcohol and bile stung her nostrils as the drunk reached for his bottle and drank deeply from it.<br>
&quot;Ugh.. couldn't you go fester somewhere else?&quot; She said as she pulled the welcome mat out of the drunk's way.<br>
&quot;S.. Sit wi.. with me.. chile.. &quot; the man slurred.<br>
Fenye cringed at the thought of sitting down with this drunken slob, but the glint of metal around his neck caught her eye. The drunk was probably wanting to tell her some distorted tale, but she recognised the talisman dangling from his neckchain.<br>
&quot;You're a Koada'Vie! Do you know Jyleel? Answer me!&quot; Her words almost sobered him up completely, the word &quot;Jyleel&quot; seemed to wash away any drunkeness in him.<br>
&quot;Y.. Yes.. I know him. But I am a shame to the Koada'Vie. I sit here, drinking my life away on cheap wine and drink.. I could never go back.. never.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why is that?&quot; she said, kneeling down to him, offering him some water to drink from her flask. &quot;Tell me your tale, old man.&quot;<br>
&quot;Years ago, I met a beautiful woman.. she was not elven in body, but her grace and manner surpassed any elf of any status I had ever known. For all I knew, she was the Mother incarnate. And she was my wife.<br>
&quot;We were the happiest of two people, and had four beautiful daughters. But by the curse of Innoruuk she fell ill and died a few weeks later after our last daughter turned of age. With her passing, my daughters left me, and of all things, became common thieves! It's like I had all my life and love sucked out from me and tossed into the wind.. and now I sit here... sulking and sucking away at this damned bottle.&quot;<br>
&quot;I am sorry to hear this tale, but what is your name? So I may call you by your proper title.&quot;<br>
&quot;I am Tanden Nybright.. no title. I am no longer a paladin of Tunare, I am a mere drunk. You.. you are able and well. I would ask of you a favor.. I may be able to regain my status someday if you help me. Will you?&quot;<br>
&quot;It depends, really, I'm supposed to..&quot;<br>
&quot;Wonderful!! I knew Tunare was still with me! My daughters, when they were born, had a necklace of pears and string given to them, made from my wife. These necklaces are all I had left of my wife, and those thieves stole them. I would ask that you return those to me, if you will. They have a camp somewhere in the Lesser Faydarks, though I'm not sure if they still remain there. Put an end to their highway robbery, and return what is rightfully mine.. and my wifes.<br>
Please, lady, I beg of you to help me.&quot; Tanden pleaded.<br>
Fenye thought for a moment, and felt a warmth in her heart. <br>
&quot;So you want me to kill them?&quot;<br>
&quot;If you have to, it saddens me to think I'm hiring an assassin, but you will be doing all of good a favor.&quot;<br>
Fenye sighed, but knew somehow this was a task that was for good, and not for waste. &quot;Yes, I'll do it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Praise Tunare!! I shall be waiting here for you!&quot;<br>
&quot;Not by this house, you go wait somewhere else. There is a little girl here with a wild wisp, and I pity the fool who gets caught between a girl and her wisp.&quot; Fenye said with a smile.<br>
<br>
Great, Fenye thought to herself, I'm going to be a bandit hunter. What a glorious profession.. <br>
