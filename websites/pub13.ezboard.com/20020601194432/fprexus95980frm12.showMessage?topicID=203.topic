This is the easiest of the epic raids, it's not even a raid, but I don't have any help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  What I must do it turn in stuff to one npc, then another, and another, etc, until the Dark Elf Corrupter spawns and two Dark Elf Reavers. The corrupter is very easy, and I've been told that when you're handing in the items to an npc, which makes another npc pop, you will be able to track the newly spawned npc from where you currently are, and I have all the /loc's to the npcs. A 60 warrior will wipe the floor with him, but I don't have any help. This is the only thing in my way of starting my epic. If anyone isn't busy and would like to help me out, please send me a tell (Zaztik). All I really need is a tank, cleric, and me to loot the stuff from him. And I have a 2 RL bard friends who can kite around the other two reavers while we kill Corruptor. But any more help would be great. Please send me a tell, I'm on....<br><br>Monday-Friday: 3:00pm EST to 6:30pm EST<br>Saturday &amp; Sunday: 7am EST to 1:00pm EST. <br><br>Or I can be on weekends on the afternoon only if that fits your time schedule. Please help, I've been trying to do this raid for many months. Thanks.<br><br>BTW if you care, this is EXACTLY what I'm supposed to do in the raid.... (taken from eqrangers.com)<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Althele in East Karana, Antonica<br><br>NOTE: Do not procede with this part until you are ready to deal with the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Dark Elf Reavers that will spawn. If you fail to kill the Dark Elf Corruptor you will have to the start quest over from the beginning.<br><br>Althele can be found close to the Barbarian Village around NEG 3650, NEG 1600. Tholris and Fang should also be there with her. If you see any of the other druids with her, do not give her the coin right away. First check to see if someone is currently in the process of doing this part of the quest. If this is the case, just wait for them to finish up. Althele, Tholris and Fang all respawn thirty minutes after all the druids have been despawned. The other possibility, is that someone had tried to do this part of the quest, failed and the spawn is messed up. If this is the case, you may have to wait for the server till after the server goes down again to be able to the quest.<br><br>You say, 'hail Althele'<br>Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally but lately?<br>Give Coin to Althele<br>Althele looks at the coin and nods gravely at you as she slips it into a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story of this coin speaks much to me as do the words you have given me. Telin sent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring are ill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.'<br><br>Althele gives you a &quot;Braided Grass Amulet&quot; to take to Sionae.<br><br>Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Clas: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>You say, 'hail Tholris'<br>Tholris stares in contemplation at the landscape.<br>Althele says 'Tholris does not speak much. He is here to assist me in my duties. He is my hands, as Fang is my eyes.<br>Fang barks in response to Althele's words.<br>You say, 'why do you need him as your hands and fang as your eyes?'<br>Althele says 'Yes. I cannot see any longer, my sight long since lost in the march of years. By the blessings of Tunare and Karana, though, I still make myself useful.<br><br>Sionae spawns after you get the Braided Grass Amulet and can be found around NEG 2300, NEG 930.<br><br>Give amulet to Sionae<br>Sionae says 'I see that the time has come. Take the amulet and give it to the third of our kin, Nuien. I will meet you at the gathering.<br><br>Sionae gives you a &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; to take to Nuien, who spawns near NEG 3650, NEG 300.<br><br>Frayed Braided Grass Amulet<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>You need to move quickly to Nuien. People who are Kill on Sight to druids may walk past him because of where he spawns. If this happens, Nuien will argo on that person. I do not know if he will argo on any hostile mobs in the area, but it is best to move quickly and not take that chance. If Nuien is killed, the spawn will be messed up and you will have to start all over. Even if Nuien argos on someone, you can still give him the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet. He will then start walking to the gathering place and Teloa will spawn.<br><br>Give amulet to Nuien<br>Nuien says 'So be it. Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is the last.<br><br>Nuien gives the &quot;Frayed Braided Grass Amulet&quot; back to you, and Teloa spawns near the waterfall around NEG 3800, NEG 2860.<br><br>Give amulet to Teloa<br>Teloa begins walking toward the gathering spot. 'Follow me to the gathering now.'<br><br>Follow Teloa back to where Althele is, which is where the druids are gathering. You will not have the amulet at this point as she does not return it to you.<br><br>Althele says 'Great mother of life and father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana. Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice for your help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom.<br>Althele snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go, find the spawn of hatred before they reach this point and destroy them!'<br><br>Dark Elf Corruptor and several Dark Reavers spawn, level supposed to be 50ish. Only the Corruptor is said to have to be killed. It is recommended that you root him, so he does not despawn on you. Additionally, it has been mentioned that he cannot be pulled, so you have to rush in and attack him.<br><br>Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come for you, fools. Your reign of weakness over the powers of the land comes to an end now!<br><br>The easist way to do this is to have two group of people waiting on the hill. The first group will attack the Dark Elf Corruptor immediately. The second group will kite the Dark Elf Reavers to keep them distracted until the Corruptor has been killed. Even though you will miss most [or all] of the fighting, you should be one of the people in the group killing the Corruptor just so that you will be able to loot his corpse right away and get the &quot;Fleshbound Tomb.&quot;<br>Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor and letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the quest to let the druids get killed. Secondly, it is more time productive to kill the reavers also then turn in the Felshbound Tomb to Althele right away.<br><br>Fleshbound Tomb<br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.5<br>Class: ALL<br>Race: ALL<br><br>Give the &quot;Fleshbound Tomb to Althele.<br><br>'Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into her ear. 'Dire news, indeed. This cannot be allowed. I must keep this book but you, XXXX , must not allow Innoruuk, to seed the land with his hatred and filth. You have only just begun your quest. The path you are guided upon will be difficult, if not impossible, but someone must finish it. Please, take this, read of it, follow its instructions. Tunare bless your path and Karana watch over you.'<br><br>Althele gives you the &quot;Earth Stained Note&quot; and the druids despawn.<br><br>Earth Stained Note<br>rolled up.<br>LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>WT: 0.1<br><br>Earth Stained Note:<br>'We cannot speak again. Our circle is now known and must seek sanctuary. In case this note were to fall into others’ hands. I cannot tell you plainly the next steps of your task. All I can say is to seek she who walks the path of the mother, she who walks the lands in service to her kin. Give her this note and she will know'<br><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>(like I said, this is extremely easy. But no help = no raid.
