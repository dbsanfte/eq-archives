(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Dont wanna waste too much time this time. But as a level 60 druid over 1 year, along with 56 cleric, I should say more words, I hope you will feel what I'm saying is unbaised at all (Please refer to my post in page 13 under this thread)<br>
<br>
1. Druid should NOT be enough to support a group well enough on healing duties if mob is AEing. Yes, this makes the game fun. If we do can make it, or with our similar situation friend, shamen, then raids will be just too easy, All the clerics just put their eyes on the MT, other groups all attached with a druid/shaman/pally/some clerics don't wanna do out CH duty then everyone is fine. The fact that clerics may still need to after some of the groupmates along with druid/shamen makes the game fun.<br>
<br>
2. It is verant's idea to make warrior the tank, cleric the healer. Pally/SK can't challenge even close enough to be as good tank as Warriors on High-end raiding, similar to druid/shamen couldn't get even close enough to be as good as cleric on healing. They made only one difference mainly on each. Defensive on warrior, and CH on cleric.<br>
<br>
No matter how you ask for a fix, it won't be enough. As a grouping druid, you have to learn how you use your mana efficiently and what kind of role you need to play in a group, from very low levels to level 60. That's our lives, AS IT IS THE CHALLENGE FOR US, THIS MAKE MORE FUN THAN PLAYING A SPECIALIZED CLASS SUCH AS CLERICS. Why I enjoy a druid is becuase her various ability, provided that every of them are not good enough. I need to learn what to do throughout the fight on inc an UBBER MOB. AND THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT, WE HAVE PLAYED MANY DIFFERENT ROLES. Make your spells ready.<br>
<br>
1. Before the fight, we gotto buff with PoTG/Circle of Seasons/Circle of Summer/Regrowth of the Grove and maybe Legacy of Thorn (if mage didn't do all on Aegis of Ro), 5 buffs memmed, 5 buffs unmemmed when I gotto start.<br>
<br>
2. During the early stage of the the fight, as it takes a while the debuffers to tash/malo/cripple whatever and slow (if possilbe) At this stage, it is so easy to lose our Main tank, debuffer while they got aggro, chain CH clerics while one of them healed just too much. Using /assist /assist /chloroblast saves a lot of lives. Yes, 1 druid prolly didn't work out much on this, but assume you have 4 druids in the ubber raid and all of them should do the same thing, so it is not a heal of 385 in 3 seconds, but a heal of 1540 in 3 seconds. A few clerics can surely help on remedy or divine light when MT losing aggro. Add up our druids' effort to support one who took hit, we could make an important role here already.<br>
<br>
3. While things seem to be set (mob got debuffed/slowed, or just the MT stick well on aggro with chain CH clerics doing their job), now we start our ubber fire debuff, open the road for wizzy/mages and ourselves when we need to nuke. Do you think it's not important at all? I definately think it's important, chain CH clerics must go OOM soon even with bard/c3/5mana rod for clerics/PoTG/necro mana etc. And warrior (MT) may need to change on tanking while their 3-min defensive wore off. Shortening the fight duration helps a lot, that's why we got a role here.<br>
<br>
4. On later stage, we start nuking Wildfire/Moonfire (or Frost), they are not very ubber nuke but you can deal around 1k damage on each nuke. Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
Tell me a class you can find you got so many roles during the whole process of the ubber fight.<br>
<br>
A few suggestions I'll make on the fix of us (druid classes):<br>
<br>
1. Clerics got Blessing of Aegolism/Marzin Mark (Sol 60 spell), Shamen got Kharass Focusing (Sol 60 spell), Enchanter got c3 (Sol 60 spell), what druids get? Don't forget we 4 Cleric/Shaman/Enchanter/Druid are the 4 main buffers from low levels to high-end. Circle of Season is a gift, but it is just similar to shaman's new group regrowth spell from luclin.<br>
<br>
We need a fix here. PoTG rocks but is it useful when our level 60 buffs be overwritten by the cleric level 60 buffs and make us obsolote? Please, I would like to see the group buffs from all 4 biggest buffers stacked together well.<br>
<br>
2. Similar to shaman, we need to get a torpor type of spells, I mean a shorter duration with larger amount healing over time. I would like to get side effects like torpor so as to limit this use for a tank, but it is still very useful to heal caster.<br>
<br>
3. Some New illusion forms that make druid have a different look with improved abilities should be good. New forms should be used in indoor (not a wolfform as it has sow effect), can cast on others so it will be benefit to groups/whole parties.<br>
<br>
Have to stop here, time to goto work.<br>

<br>
This is disingenuous. The only time a druid has trouble acting as a group healer in raids is when there are nasty AEs and/or very hard hitting mobs that have aggroed on one of your group members. I understand the AE issue and how hard it can be to heal when everyone in the group is getting hit for significant damage simultaneously. The other part is bogus. If a group member gains aggro from a mob that does too much damage too quickly for a druid to heal, often a cleric would not be able to heal quickly enough in the same situation. The only tool they have for that situation druids lack is CE, which cannot be chain cast for increased benefit. CH is going to be far too slow to apply, and the cleric heals other than CH and CE aren't orders of magnitude greater than a druids. CE does give clerics a buffer time in which to act, true, but the healing it supplies isn't going to be fast enough to provide much of a buffer on mobs that hit for over 600. This isn't a problem specific to druids, it is an issue that all healers face, including clerics. Healing riposte damage is something druids can do just fine. It is controllable damage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt;you said it yourself.. S.E.C.O.N.D.A.R.Y healers... get used to that... you are assist healers... you are NOT a healer for a high level raid any more&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Well then I guess you all are screwed, since its always the Druids who are told to be the secondary healers. Do you understand what a secondary healer is in a high end raid? Its the people keeping everyone who isn't a MT or Rampage Tank alive, since that is what the clerics are focus'd on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
VI designed the damage output of AEs and riposte damage on purpose. It is specifically designed to challenge the healing abilities of the secondary healers of a raid force. Saying you are having problems healing in these situations is like saying a tank has problems keeping aggro while defensive. It's by design. As mentioned above, this is a healer specific issue and a tuning issue, not a druid issue. It sounds like you are complaining that the very high end encounters are hard. Will you heal  as well in these situations as a cleric? Nope, nor should you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt;Your Nukes are fine... you out nuke magicians&lt;&lt;<br>

A) The request was that Verant would fix Moonfire, which until the recent changes (Made after this petition was completed) had a worse ratio and slower cast time than our next lower Cold based nuke. That's what we call a broken useless spell. Verant fixed it, however. And no, we don't outnuke Magicians.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let's just compare spells shall we? I'll start with each class's best nuke, both of which are fire based.<br>
<br>
Wildfire - resists against fire (druid)<br>
Level:  59 <br>
Mana:  320 <br>
Casting Time:  6.5 seconds <br>
Recast Time:  Instant <br>
Actual Effects: Target: Direct Damage (1024) <br>
<br>
Shock of Fiery Blades - resists against fire (mage) <br>
Level:  60 <br>
Mana:  334 <br>
Casting Time:  6.8 seconds <br>
Recast Time:  Instant <br>
Actual Effects: Target: Direct Damage (1005)<br>
<br>
The druid spell comes 1 level earlier, costs less mana, casts faster, and does more damage. This is the best nuke available to each class.<br>
<br>
Breath of Karana - resists against magic (druid)<br>
Level:  56 <br>
Mana:  250 <br>
Casting Time:  3 seconds <br>
Recast Time:  2.5 seconds <br>
Actual Effects: Target: Direct Damage from 772 (L56) to 812 (L60) <br>
  Target: Stun <br>
  Target: Throw in Air <br>
  Target: Push Back <br>
<br>
Shock of Steel - resists against magic (mage)<br>
Level:  57 <br>
Mana:  275 <br>
Casting Time:  6 seconds <br>
Recast Time:  Instant <br>
Actual Effects: Target: Direct Damage (795 - 825) <br>
<br>
The druid spell has a 3.2 dmg/mana ratio while the mage spell has a 3.0 dmg/mana ratio. The druid spell is going be easier to resist due to the stun component however. Against lower level and lower resist/debuffed mobs the druid spell is better. Against higher level/resist mobs, the mage spell is better. Feel free to correct me on this, I am neither a druid nor a mage.<br>
<br>
I would compare cold nukes, but mages don't get one.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no, we don't outnuke Magicians&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt;At level 59, paladins will have a heal over time spell with greater mana efficiency than chloroblast, but that advantage dissappears one level later.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Again, the level 60 Nature's Touch spell is the exact same mana ratio as Chloroblast. Neither of them, however, can compare to a paladin's group healing. Read the petition.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I am aware that chloroblast and NT have the same ratio. I have 2 points to make. First, I was not referring to NT, I was referring to Nature's Recovery, which has a much superior ratio to Celestial Cleansing. They are 3.6 hp/mana and 3.1 hp/mana respectively. Secondly, NT allows you to heal more hp in a shorter amount of time than chloroblast. 2 casts of chloroblast will heal 770 points of damage in 9 seconds, taking into account the 3 second spell gem recovery. 1 cast of NT will heal 880 points of damage in 5.5 seconds. No, the mana efficiency hasn't improved, but the ability to keep up with faster damage has. None of the other secondary healers have the ability to heal this quickly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt;Please don't tell me you are actually asking to have the duration made the same as torpor without any of the side effects of torpor&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
NR does 900 damage vs Torpor's 1200 and NR costs 50 mana more. Suitable trade offs for not having the snare/slow effects of Torpor.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
NR also isn't group only. The snare effect of torpor isn't a big deal, but the slow component is. Instead of being at 50-90% haste, the person this is cast is on is now at -30% percent haste. That is at a minimum a 60% reduction in damage output. That is a pretty hefty cost. I wouldn't see a problem with druids just getting torpor, assuming shamans got NT in return. Does that sound fair? Have fun farming the plat to pay for torpor though. =0 <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

5 clerics chain casting CH, each healing ~2500 hp  in 10 seconds of the warrior.  If you try to be too 'efficient' and heal more than 60% of the warrior the MA may die due to a fizzle or lag.<br>
<br>
NT rotation for uber mobs<br>
7 druids chain castin NT, each healing ~2000 in 11 seconds of the warrior.<br>
<br>
Im sorry, CH isnt 'mandatory'.  I think people are just LAZY and want to be safe.  Its the typical &quot;well, warriors are the best so I want them tanking and clerics are the best healers so I want them healing&quot;.  It CAN be done with other healers but many are just too spoiled or scared or both.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if it were....Clerics have always and will always get in groups before a druid. Can you do a group without a cleric? Yeah. Do people want to? No. They look for a tank a cleric and a mana regenner first and formost. Then they fill in the rest.<br>
<br>
Clerics will always be wanted for groups. With CH their healing will always be unrivaled. &quot;<br>
<br>
Here is where I question your lvl.  Um, lvl 60 warriors SOLO.  Most lvl 60 melees SOLO or go in groups of all melees.  They take virtually no damage.  They want people in the group to help them kill faster, period.  Clerics to not offer this, druids do.  The healing that druids offer is plenty in the high end exp grind and they offer offense and travel as well.<br>

Another disingenous statement. Shamans asked for a DR based slow because their normal slows are MAGIC based and many mobs in velious had very high MAGIC resists. That has nothing to do with whether DR and PR based spells are more easily landed than FR/CR based spells. Apples to apples, oranges to oranges please.<br>

<br>
The point is, you are asking for changes that would affect the relative worth of other classes. You aren't asking that secondary healing in general be improved to allow non-clerics to heal on raids. You are asking for druids to get an upgrade. No class exists in a vacuum. <br>
<br>
Improve druid healing enough, and they will start to displace clerics in xp groups. I play a 59 paladin, my wife is a 59 shaman. The last thing we look for in an xp group is a cleric, we want damage output. We would take a druid over a cleric any day, because the druid can add decent damage output and has other usefull abilities, including snare. Snare is actually a pretty important thing for us if we are in a dungeon. If the proverbial poo hits the fan, the druid can still add significant healing power. Clerics are only needed in xp groups when the group is taking lots and lots of damage. With the improvement in gear available to melees, clerics are becoming less and less needed for xp groups. <br>
<br>
Improve druid healing enough, and the desire to have more than 1 or 2 shamans on a raid will plummet. Shamans already have lesser healing tools for raids than druids do. Healing power stacks, direct damage spells stack, debuffing/buffing power doesn't. If the only way shamans stack in power on a raid is through healing, and druids do it much better, you will only want at most 2 shamans along.<br>
<br>
Give druids a group heal on the order of healing wave of prexus, and the biggest reason paladins are wanted on raids is lost. Believe me, most paladins know what it is like to have no role on a raid. The group heal spells are only valid in specific encounters. Why add a paladin to your raid force if a druid with a larger mana pool, no hybrid casting penalty, specialisation, and other skills can do the job better? It won't be for the paladins stellar damage output.<br>
<br>
Of the secondary healers, druids currently have the best single target instant heal. You are asking for druids to have the best single target instant heal (upgraded of course), a better single target heal over time spell (without any penalties) and the best group heal. This doesn't seem wrong to you? You can argue better that all secondary healers need a raid healing upgrade, but I don't see a case for saying that druids specifically need them.  Personally, I think secondary healing is just fine, but that is just my opinion.<br>
<br>
You may discount the importance of versatility, but I think that is a mistake. Assume druids and shamans healing power is identical. If you are on a raid and no one in your group is taking damage, a druid can use DDs to good effect against most mobs. A shaman in the same situation cannot do damage nearly as well, especially when you take into account dot stacking issues. Now assume your DD power is identical to mages. If you are on a raid against a mob and none of your DD spells will land, you at least have a very valid role of secondary healer to occupy you. A mage in the same situation can summon mod rods and fireworks. <br>

The third problem is that the milk is already spilled. The petition has been sent to Verant and its far too likely that it will be ignored. Bad numbers changes it from asking for 'a group heal' to asking for 'such an unbalanced spell?' .The thing Druids have to hope here is that whoever reads this for verant doesnt just toss it in the round archive under the desk right there. Asking for spells better then anyone else doesnt go in line with making the class better at being second best at everything, its an aim for the first spot. Dangrims is also totaly right that this petition without any numbers would most likely been alot better. The problems are right, the conclusions in spell numbers are not.<br>

<br>
The initial petition complains that druids are no longer viable healers in high level situations, while Clerics and Shamen remain capable of healing under those circumstances (among other things, but that one issue seems to be what ninety percent of the discussion is revolving around).<br>
<br>
Perhaps the problem is not in the druid, but in the perception of his place in the raid.<br>
<br>
There are only three classes in the game who never change their focus throughout their entire game life.  Warriors start the game hitting small things with large weapons, and never stop until level 60, although the things they hit get meaner and the large weapons get larger.  Clerics begin the game healing the wounds caused by the random creatures that one sees throughout Norrath and Luclin, and by the end of their levels, they are still healing, although they are considerably better at it.  Wizards start out with the ability to do damage to anything that looks like it might be dangerous, and although they do broaden their focus a bit over time, by 60 they still are essentially large artillary pieces, doing extreme amounts of damage until they are out of mana, then essentially helpless, since their largest function has been exhausted.<br>
<br>
And then we come to every other class in the game (except perhaps the Beastlords, since the discussion is still out as to what the extent of their function is at all levels).  Necromancers start the game as Lifetappers, their vaunted pets of only minimal use until level 4 (or 8 depending on which Necro you talk to).  They eventually broaden their horizons to become a major pet class, a class that can Heal, use Dots, limited DD (very limited), and develop into a more group friendly class as time goes on, until their original purpose has very little resemblance to final product.  Rogues and Monks start their careers as second class Warriors, developing eventually into the highest damage output 'tank' class in the game, within rigid parameters (they cannot take damage and require a Taunting class to take damage for them).  The Shamen start the game as much tanks as casters, due to the armour they can wear, developing first into a Healer and DOT class, losing Healing power in relation to the dedicated Healing class of the Cleric, but soon gaining a pet, and never losing the title of the Buffing Class of Everquest.  And so we continue through every class in the game.<br>
<br>
What then of the druids?  If you hold that they are not a viable healing class after 55, is it possible that they are not intended to be?  Many have disagreed, citing that the druids are still a very capable healing class clear up to 60 in all situations, while others (one can discount Aidon, since he is so busy running into trees that it has not occurred to him yet that there might be a forest) believe that is not true.  Could this be because druids are intended to have another function after 55 that is not so based on their ability (or lack of ability) to heal?  Or perhaps this new role is not fully workable, and some provision should be made to enhance it after 55, perhaps at the cost of any Healing spells after that level (balance must be maintained).<br>
<br>
I do realize that the primary argument is that balance is not currently maintained, although the 'gimme list' is somewhat laughable, containing as it does enhanced versions of existing specialist spells in almost every area of the game (missing only demands for Lures, Resses and Complete Heal, and some of the advocates of the gimme list have demanded those too).<br>
<br>
There are probably three primary alternatives.<br>
<br>
First, the list can be modified back to a realistic point.  A self only version of Protection of the Grove is quite viable and very reasonable, since the Clerics do indeed have a precedent with their self only Buff line.  Stacking issues can likewise be examined, perhaps finding a way to stack symbols, high level Cleric buffs or general high level buffs with the high level druid buffs (or at least a compromise, as has been made with other stacking issues, where some aspects stack and others are over written).  Beyond that, Cold and Fire based versions of Winged Death, with identical mana cost and damage?  A cold based equivalent to Ro's Smouldering Disjunction?  I would hesitate to add either of those, although they would certainly be worth examining for suitability and balance.<br>
<br>
A second possibility would involve a major reworking of the class, but would be viable.  Remove the 10 percent penalty for Healing, and even add five percent to that, at the cost of all Snare spells.  Give Complete Heal to the druid class, at the cost of all DD and DOT spells.  Give better hit point and AC buffs, at the cost of Port and movement spells, then to balance it, add lower grade DD spells, enhanced against the undead.  Many posts in this discussion have agreed that makes a balanced class, and it would certainly give the healing abilities the original post desired.<br>
<br>
A third possibility involves looking at the class as a whole, instead of only a portion of it.  It takes as long to get from 50 to 60 as it does from 1 to 50, so we can consider this petition to be involving only a quarter of the life of the character (assuming 55 to 60 being half of the road from 50 to 60, which it is not, but we need some sort of rough benchmark).  The druid class is held to be very powerful from 1 to 55, not only in its ability to solo (the argument of many here), but also in its ability to do virtually everything, even if it is not done as well as the class with a distinctive in the ability.  Should a limitation on 55 to 60 be considered a reasonable price to pay for excess power from 1 to 55? (whether there is indeed excess power at those levels is a point for another post, since the originators of this petition have insisted those levels not be considered)<br>
<br>
The bottom line though, is that in spite of the insistance that the levels from 1 to 55 not be considered for the purpose of this discussion, the gimme list attempts to define the role of the druid from 55 to 60 as being the same role the druid has played from 1 to 55, and I would not be so fast to assume that, since so few other classes keep the same role throughout their entire life.<br>
<br>
And the standard replies to the trolls who attempt to reply to any argument they do not agree with.  I do play in the high level game as both caster and tank, but do not play a druid myself.  I group with druids, my guild employs them in the high level game, I have grouped with them both before and after 55.  I have found many druids that I regularly hunt with have little problem finding groups, because from 1 to 55 they created reputations for themselves as good group members, and I have seen druids haunting zone borders shouting for groups who do not get them, because they soloed from 1 to 55, and nobody in the high end game has every heard of them.<br>

I do not agree with the part about the 1900 damage lvl 60 dot.  While this would be nice, seeing as we have no upgrade to winged death, I think that may be asking for too much.<br>
<br>
All I do in the high end game is heal, that's all druids are wanted for since our complementary classes are busy fuflilling their roles (wizzies are nuking, necros are mana dumping or dotting, shamans are buffing and snaring, etc etc)  What most of Norrath needs us to do is heal.  Secondary healer is a important role, and one I enjoy.  But it is very difficult to keep up with mobs, so the idea of improving our healing skills I totally agree with.<br>
<br>
I personally HATE the idea of the druid epic being a dot.  I see it as like a 350 nuke or so much better.  I also have no problem with snare being removed from the effect.  <br>

I'm just going to refute one comment you made with regards to uber mobs.<br>
<br>
Lets take the avatar of war for example. Quads for 1134. Takes at least 8 clerics CH at two second intervals to keep the MT alive. Requires around 3-4 MT swaps.<br>
<br>
Please tell me how a pack of druids, or shaman for that matter, are going to keep up with that kind of dmg? They're not. Clerics will never be replaced on uber mobs requiring any significant CH chain. <br>
<br>
Druids are not asking to replace clerics as the primary healer. They are asking for a reason to attend that raid beyond the druid_bot_01 that someone brought along to buff/debuff.<br>
<br>
Perhaps what they are asking for is not the proper solution, but with out attention from SoE to the total lack of need for a druid in the high level game nothing will change. <br>

I have a 60 druid, a 52 warrior, and a 40 monk.<br>
<br>
Sobe has like 3 level 60 characters, a couple more 55+'s and some other jazz.<br>
<br>
Scirocco, how many characters do you have?<br>
<br>
RTFM, you?<br>
<br>
MF?<br>
<br>
Tuved?<br>
<br>
Nuvian?<br>
<br>
This petition was the work of this community.  A vast number of us have multiple characters of reasonable level.  A large number of us have been playing the game since 1999.  Do not doubt our knowledge of the game, it is sound. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

Clerics have problems getting xp groups when other classes can match their heals.  That's my primary concern about all your requests.  If the spell they add was high enough that it was likely only to be used on raids, that's one thing (maybe, although it would still need to be examined for an xp group situation).<br>
<br>
Let me give you an example of what I've run into LFGs as a cleric.  First off, if there's already one in a group you're usually out of the loop.  Two druids, no big deal.  One can handle the combat side, the other can heal (and in the 29-33 range almost as good as I can).  Two shammys, same deal (actually, with regen going I think they heal better than I do overall, but this isn't about me or shamans).  My stuns are nice, but if there's already a paladin stunning is covered (since I can't quite chain stun yet).  If a group has one empty slot, and no cleric or SoW, they'll go for the SoW every time.  Up until recently, my rez was looked down on (no xp).  Nobody wanted it.  The only time I got to use it was when people were bound so far away it would take too long to get them back into the group otherwise.<br>
<br>
Now for a further downside.  Clerics, since we lack invisibility, don't have the luxury of tons of zone mobility.  If we can't get a port, we get to walk.  In the open.  So if we camp in a zone that was cleric friendly one day, and come back to LFG in a zone that doesn't really have a need for one, we're stuck.  We don't get to port ourselves elsewhere, invis ourselves to walk somewhere, solo in the zone we're in (non-undead blue cons are rough, I'll blow through a lot of my mana and health, undead take a little less out of me but it's still not ideal).<br>
<br>
So again, I'll say that I applaud druids and all the classes that are getting together to talk about their concerns to VI.  But it's important that you consider the implications of what you request in ALL aspects of the game, not just raids (this'd be a good time to note again that while the petition is focused on raids, some of the proposed changes would have an impact in the mid-level game).  And again I'll point out that lots of classes aren't real happy with their high-end roles.  The holy trinity is pretty well set (including the role for my cleric, should I ever get him there).  Shaman (at least from the ones I've talked with) have a role, but it's difficult to justify bunches on a raid (at least that's the biggest complaint I've heard from the ones I know).  Mages and necros (again I won't presume to speak for all of them, but the ones I know, and personal expierience on the necro part) aren't real happy with the role they got tied down with.  For the most part, at least given what I've heard, most of the other classes are at least doing what they like doing and don't have a huge issue getting in on raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 8:50:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=439>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us!

<br>
Verant can take the moon and shove it.  The freaking moon is the primary reason why this petition was created...the lack of druid upgrading with Luclin along with the huge upgrade to Mobs is what caused most of us to finally get fed up.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Rezes are nice, but it won't save the class. One spell isn't sufficient to save any class. You can't hold our rez above our head and not allow us to hold general purpose DoT's, sow, ports, and snare above yours. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Hey Clerics, are you willing to share CH with Druids if we share DoT's SoW ports and snare with you?  I'm willing...   <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

I currently am a lvl 54 halfling druid on the Rathe and I find myself soloing every night due to the fact that nobody wants a druid in their groups anymore.  I can barely get into guild groups half the time as my powers as a druid are not needed in the high lvl game.<br>
