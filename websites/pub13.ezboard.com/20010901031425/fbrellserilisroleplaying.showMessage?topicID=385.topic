With all the heat during the day, one would think that the sands would retain some warmth through the night. But it never did.<br>
<br>
Ohhh it wasn't Everfrost cold. He knew first hand how cold it got there. But come unprepared, and you'll wake up in the morning cold, stiff and potentially sick<br>
<br>
Minz wondered how long he had been here. It seemed forever. Days blending into night and into day again.<br>
<br>
The crocs fell in a stream of constant scaled gore now. His pack contained enough gator meat to feed all of Freeport. But he felt lost in a malaise. Unable to move forward or back. Like the sands beneath him were slowly, almost imperceptibly pulling him under.<br>
<br>
The one constant, through all this was Jezeran. Though she often seemed distant, the few smiles and her healing touch sustained him. He had come to depend on her. She was a dear friend.<br>
<br>
Morning came, dawn glimmering over the ocean. Jez was already in her morning ritual of prayer, exercise and more prayer. She finished just as he was rolling out his blankets. &quot;Mornin Jez,&quot; he said blearily.<br>
<br>
She gave him her &quot;its about time&quot; look.<br>
<br>
He smiled softly at her as she returned to her prayers. Making her final pledges of loyalty and fidelity to Errolisi. &quot;I?ve gotta run into town Jez. You need anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A sharpening stone if you would,&quot; Was her curt reply as she surveyed the blade of her sword.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, I'll be back in a bit.&quot; He yelled over his shoulder as he headed into the desert toward Freeport.<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
lost...<br>
<br>
Beige sand &amp; heat shimmers as far as the eye can see.<br>
<br>
compass broken...<br>
<br>
It seemed an easy journey... Strait across the desert...<br>
<br>
Thirsty<br>
<br>
but the fall...<br>
<br>
A tall dune...gave way under his boots...<br>
<br>
tumbling...head over heals<br>
<br>
...water gone...the morning sun beating down.<br>
<br>
The armored rogue planted his spear in the sand, leaning heavily on the sturdy shaft. Shading his eyes ... scanning the horizon. Pulling his tunic off, tossing it aside.<br>
<br>
He spied a form walking aimlessly. Hooting and cursing the sun. Spinning wildly in an unnatural manner... a madman ... Driven wild in the noonday heat.<br>
<br>
&quot;How similar are we..?&quot; Minz thought. His thoughts cut short as the madman threw an arc of lightening at him. It sizzled off the madman?s fingers. Crackling though the air in a loud viscous snap. The bolt hit him hard. And left him shaken and burnt. The smell of Ozone and sizzled flesh hanging in the air as Minz plunged his harpoon into the lunatic's chest.<br>
<br>
The lunatic fell quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank the gods!&quot; he muttered. The madman carried a flask of water! Minz downed it quickly as he tramped on wearily through the blistering heat. He snickered to himself &quot;well, this is cool compared to the lightening. Gods!!...Does this desert ever end? ...There!...&quot;<br>
<br>
Throwing down his spear &amp; running toward the pool of water...only to see it vanish before his eyes.<br>
<br>
..moans of lamentation erupted from his dry, cracked lips.<br>
<br>
The late afternoon sun burning the back of his neck..<br>
<br>
He wandered on...<br>
<br>
Day turned to dusk. Confident strides now shambling steps. Boots barely leaving the sand. The desert air cooled as the sun receded behind the hill to the west. He stopped in his tracks, when he saw it. &quot;Whas tha...&quot; he mutted. Shock hit him as he recognized the crumpled form of the madman he'd slain earlier. Dropping to his knees... he cried out in anguish. The rogue fell back ... exhausted ... eyes clenched shut ... giving himself over to the weight of his weariness.<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
The sun virtually boiled the life out of one.<br>
<br>
He had given in to exhaustion some time ago, falling still next to the dead body of a dessert wanderer. Dusty air washing over cracked, bloody lips. Sucking the moisture out of him from the inside out.<br>
<br>
The corpse next to him long since desiccated to a paper like texture.<br>
<br>
Drifts of sand mounding up on his right side, as the dessert claimed the rogue for its own.<br>
<br>
Barriers of the mind, held for a lifetime, broke down as he finally grasps the finality of his situation.<br>
<br>
He was at home. . .in the farmhouse where he grew up.<br>
<br>
. . .His hands were tiny . . .unscared. Well mostly. He felt his face. . . smooth, almost soft, and a lock of reddish hair fell before his eyes. Long ago, that was the only way to tell Minz and Munz apart. Munz's hair always had a dark brown hue, while Minz's had a reddish tint to it in the summer.<br>
<br>
'Red? It hasn't been red since?'<br>
<br>
Ccccrrraaasshhhhh<br>
<br>
A high pitched scream pierced the night air. Munz sat bolt upright. His young face pale with horror.<br>
<br>
Eight, maybe nine years old.<br>
<br>
Munz's mandolin sat beside his bed. Polished as ever. And sure enough, there was a small tarnished dagger underneath my pillow. Stolen from a shop in Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Ssssmmmaacckkk<br>
<br>
&quot;Nnoooooooo!&quot; The cry echoed. The high feminin voice was unmistakable to Minz. It was his mother. A heavy thud sounded against the wall. The grunt she made as she hit the wall sunk into him like a void opening in his stomach.<br>
<br>
Munz was already at the door, glancing back urgently.<br>
<br>
He already knew what would happen, what was waiting on the other side of that door. And what it would do. But I was already out of my bed and Munz had opened the door, dashing out into the mayhem.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leave her alone!!&quot; Munz yelled. A massive fist bashed him in the jaw. Sending him across the room, landing next to mother.<br>
<br>
She lay there . . .bloodied lip and swollen jaw,<br>
<br>
. . .the loving touch of her husband.<br>
<br>
Furniture was strewn about the room. . . the rug slid off the side . . .a chair broken into kindling . . . dishes broken and smashed.. ..a leg broken off the table. Bottles of beer strewn about the floor.<br>
<br>
Minz was a second behind his twin?but no battle cry erupted from him. Rushing toward his father. . .arm held high . . . just catching the terrified glint in his mothers eye as the tiny dagger he held sunk into his fathers thigh.<br>
<br>
Rrrrrrraaaaahhhhhhhhhhhrrrrrr!! The Massive barbarian yelled out more in fury than pain. Snarling face burning down onto the small form of his son. Doubled up fists raised high, hurtling straight down in a tremendous bash. Crashing onto his shoulder, knocking him to the floor with a solid whack..<br>
<br>
Eyes clouded<br>
<br>
Footsteps. . . A scream. . . mother again. . . solid smacking sound and a cry of pain.<br>
<br>
His father bellowed, &quot;Sooo you haven't learned not to play with knives boy!!!&quot; A deep rumbling voice like the sound of boulders rolling down a mountain. A hand grabbed his hair, hauling him upward. The door creaked open, and Minz's eyes cleared just enough to see Munz help Mom out the door. Dad saw it too. Grinning wickedly as he yelled after them. &quot;That's right. . .You girls run along while Minz and I talk man to man!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz barely saw the fist as it rushed towards his face? a shot of pain rang though him. The blow heard as much as it was felt. Sending him flying across the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Get up boy!!!&quot; he roared. &quot;I ain't done with you yet!!!&quot; A booted foot crashed into his torso. &quot;Up!! Loser!&quot; Another kick... this time to his back. He was rolling it seemed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Useless piece of trash!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Boot.<br>
<br>
&quot;Worthless waste of breath!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Boot<br>
<br>
&quot;Pathetic piece of filth!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Boot!!<br>
<br>
The deep bass voice reverberated in his head. Throbbing in his ears. Wicked, malicious rumbles from deep within. He was in a corner now. &quot;Upp!!&quot; Hands hauled him up. Minz pried open swollen eyes to see his father. Towering over him. Eyes red with alcohol and fury.<br>
<br>
Blood still trickled down the old man's leg. Tiny blade still embedded deeply. &quot;How many times have I told you not to play with knives.&quot; He bellowed. Wrenching the dagger from his leg as an exclamation point. &quot;Well this time boy,&quot; he hisses &quot;you'll not forget.&quot;<br>
<br>
His father's meaty hand tore off the boy's nightshirt. Pale hairless chest. Minz watched as his father pressed the blade to his sternum . . .sinking it bene<br>
ath the skin . . . a thick stream of blood trickling down his abdomen.<br>
<br>
It took a moment for the pain to reach him. . . as if his mind couldn't quite comprehend what was happening. But the searing sting of the blade bit into him, cutting to the bone. And he screamed out horrifically.<br>
<br>
&quot;This'll teachya boy!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The massive figure grabbed his boy by the wrist, yanking him to the floor. Pinning his hand in place<br>
<br>
He held the tiny blade aloft, a slim silver shard sticking out of a great fist. In a split second of recognition, Minz screamed out. &quot;Nnnnoooooooooo!&quot;<br>
<br>
His high pitched voice piercing the night. As the dagger plunged through his outstretched hand and sunk into the wooden floor underneath. Pinning him in place.<br>
<br>
Blackness clouded his vision. Mercifully, he passed out<br>
<br>
Minz slumped to the wooden floor.<br>
<br>
&quot; . . .n't for get to take the trash out now, can I?&quot; he heard his father mutter. Consciousness slipping back to him. A rough hand held his arm?dragging him across the littered floor . . .splinters and shards of glass digging into him.<br>
<br>
His wound stretched open painfully. He was no longer pinned to the floor. Droplets of blood fell to the floor, smearing as the boys body slid over them. No longer pinned, yet his body refused ever effort to move.<br>
<br>
The barbarian hoisted him up and tossed him easily out the door. Throwing the tiny dagger after him.<br>
<br>
Slamming the door shut behind him.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
Empty eyes stare at the sun . . .burnt retina. . .lost in a horrific dreamscape of forgotten memories and tortuous nightmares. The sand blew over him. Slowly burying him in a premature grave. Only his chest and head remained uncovered now. The lower half of his body entombed under the shifting sand dune. Momentary consciousness fleeing under the sun's searing heat.<br>
<br>
. . . all around him the field stretched on. Criss crossing trials of earth plowed in a jumbled, crazy manner. Weaving in and out of each other. Always strait as an arrow, yet always moving.<br>
<br>
At his hip, a bag full of seed. Seeming to undulate without moving.<br>
<br>
He reached into the bag, grabbing a hand full to sow.<br>
<br>
Pain seared his skin. Burning his flesh black. Yet he did not flinch. Tossing the seed to the earth around him?tiny bursts of flame flickering as they floated in slow motion to the ground.<br>
<br>
Flames shot up all around him as the first flicker reached the ground. The barren landscape now filled with cascades of fire.<br>
<br>
. . . a harvest of flames. . .<br>
<br>
He spread his arms wide . . . screaming in agony as the tongues of heat licked his body.<br>
<br>
..rising off the ground on an updraft of shimmering heat . . . willing himself forward across the pyric field.<br>
<br>
His father stared up at him. . . a heavy axe resting on the barbarian's shoulder. Standing proudly on the stump that marred their farm. The old man's face split with pride and hatred.<br>
<br>
Minz swung low over the old youth?raining acidic leaves of flame over him?laughing as the man twisted and fell in agony. He breathed in deeply the sick sweet smell of his father's burnt flesh.<br>
<br>
. . . a lyric sing song voice called out to him. . . &quot;Miinnzz . . . Minzz.&quot; his mother . . . dance seductively among the flames. Each tongue of heat flickering over her body slowly, almost sensuously. The flames forming an ever shifting orange and yellow gown. She gazed at him alluringly...demure heavy lidded eyes full of lust. Looking at her son as no mother ought to.<br>
<br>
He swooped down cradling her in his arms . . .kissing her hungrily as her thin clothing burnt off . . .sailing to the sky in smoldering ashes. The flames receded around them and a bed appeared. Her bed. The one she shared with her husband. Pulling him down onto it.<br>
<br>
She giggled wickedly as he lowered himself onto her . . .wrapping her legs about her son's waist . . . grinding her hips to his pelvis . . . the son pressing himself to whence he came . . . their bodies undulating in a rhythmic dance . . . the lovers crying out loudly . . .screaming in agony and ecstasy as they burst into flames from the inside out.<br>
<br>
. . . the world grew white hot?all definition lost . . .nothing but. . . searing. . . endless ecstasy.<br>
<br>
Minz threw himself into it . . .<br>
<br>
Giving himself up to the kiln of eternity<br>
<br>
His lungs protested, rebelling against the liquid being poured down his throat.<br>
<br>
The water felt wrong in his mouth? a quiet familiar voice . . . sounds melding out of focus. He was in the desert. This was water he felt on his cracked lips. Coughing it up in weak heaves<br>
<br>
He was alive.<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
It was the dark of night when he awoke. One of those nights where not a single star pierces the evening sky. His mind still swirled from the fever that gripped him the night before.<br>
<br>
He tried to sit up. &quot;Ooohhhhhh.&quot; Aching muscles refused to comply with his request.<br>
<br>
There was a rustling near him. A damp cloth blotted his forehead<br>
<br>
He flinched away from the touch?taking a sharp breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy friend, easy.&quot; The voice seemed float out of the ether<br>
<br>
He threw his head from one side to the other weakly. . . frantically. Even in the darkest of nights they should be visible. Nothing!! Not a single flicker of anything?everything . . .unseen.<br>
&quot;Whh who's there?&quot; The rogue called out.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rest easy Minz, you've been through a lot. Wasn't sure you'd make it to be honest. Its Sylavn. Jinghizu and Rach are nearby. Here, water,take a sip.&quot; A hand slipped behind his head, raising it up a bit and a cup was put to his lips. Still he saw nothing. The water was cool, soothing his sore throat. &quot;As soon as you're strong enough, we'll get you out of this heat. Maybe after the sun goes down.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz gagged and coughed as the cool liquid slipped down the wrong pipe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sun? Wha?&quot; Minz asked after coughing up the water<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? You still with me Minz?&quot; Sylavn asked. Blotting the rogue?s face again.<br>
<br>
&quot;The sun goes down? It's night. . . isn't it?&quot; Minz felt the wave of a hand over his face. &quot;Sylavn?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sssssshhhh. Rest Minz. You need to rest.&quot; His head was lowered back to the pillow<br>
<br>
. . . blind . . . he thought to himself. Teetering on the edge of wakefulness. The possibility of being blind shocked and frightened him. &quot;Gods&quot; he muttered. Softly pleading before drifting back into the feverish, haunted sleep.<br>
<br>
. . . he was in the hills above his childhood home. . . he could navigate these woods with his eyes closed. Crouching behind a slender elm tree. Wrapped in the shadows he had grown to know. He wore a pair of rough denim pants, torn in spots from the snatching and grabbing brambles of the woods.<br>
<br>
A woolen vest hung loosely on his shoulders. Far too big for his slender frame. Stolen from an unwary traveler.<br>
<br>
His small dagger tied to his ankle with two pliable vines.<br>
<br>
Blood still seeped from the wound in his hand.<br>
<br>
It had been three days since he ran off.<br>
<br>
Three days since he had been tossed away as trash.<br>
<br>
Three days of living in the woods around his home. Eating berries and what ever else he could find. He dare not light a fire. Bandits, thieves and all sorts of other creatures inhabited these woods. Any of whom would gladly finish the work his father started.<br>
<br>
Ahead of him was the clearing where his mother came to pray. A rough circle some 15 feet across. A large slab of granite set just off center. On it were carved marking of some old meaning. Worn and faded. But mother knew them well.<br>
<br>
She was there now. Kneeling at the altar in fervent prayer. She'd been there the better part of two days.<br>
<br>
She and Munz had gone to Qeynos that night. She returned in the morn . . . alone. Likely leaving Munz with a friend. Minz had watched her from the field, hiding among the corn stalks. She went in the house and left quickly. A small pack on her shoulder. His father had followed her out . . . pleading with her. But she never even looked at him.<br>
<br>
Minz silently followed her to the circle, and had stayed close ever since.<br>
<br>
Watching over his mother. . .prone in his own silent vigil. . . his mother murmuring prayers in her native language.<br>
<br>
A thrashing of the woods drew his attention. . . a bear? No, a bear wouldn't be so loud.<br>
<br>
He snatched the dagger from his ankle as soon as he heard the voice . . . his father?s bellow echoed through the trees. ?Nhamine!!?? The old man stopped at the circle's edge, looking forlorn. Long face . . . dark reddened eyes sunk deep into their sockets . . . thick arms hanging limply at his sides. &quot;Nhamine. . . &quot; he almost whisper. &quot;. . .love . . .? . . . I . . . I am sorry.&quot; His head dropped . . .chin meeting his chest in a pitiful expression of remorse. &quot; . . .Nhamine . . . please . . . ohhh gods please. . . &quot; A quiet sob escaping the hulking man's lips.<br>
<br>
Young Minz stared. . . mesmerized. His father? This was not the man he knew.<br>
<br>
The movement startled him. Mom raised her head, looking toward dad. From where he hid he couldn't see her face.<br>
<br>
Slowly. . . deliberately she stood. Holding a slender hand out to her husband. For the first time in days, he saw his mother's face.<br>
<br>
Pristine and perfect.<br>
<br>
Dad looked at her confused for a moment. Looking at his feet. No. Looking at the earth in front of his feet.<br>
<br>
At the boundary of the sacred circle.<br>
<br>
Then back at his wife. Taking a step forward, planting his foot uncertainly on the hallowed earth. Another step and he was in front of her . . . his massive hand slipping into hers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh Nhamine, I am sorry,&quot; he sobbed. Dropping to his knees. Wrapping his arms about her waist, leaning his head to her bussom. His head nearly at her chin. She held him as he cried uncontrollably. Listening to her husband sob &quot;I'm sorry&quot; over and over again.<br>
<br>
The din of the woods seemed to grow a little louder<br>
<br>
Finally the spasms of sorrow seemed to ebb in the man's body He gazed up at her. They spoke softly. For a long time.<br>
<br>
He couldn't quite hear them, no matter how much he tried.<br>
<br>
A weak smile from dad.<br>
<br>
A warm loving one from mom.<br>
<br>
The forest seemed to quiet again and he could hear them.<br>
<br>
&quot;. . . should not be out here alone Nhamine. You know the bandits are about.&quot; Dad said to his wife. Deep voice some how softer, almost quaking.<br>
<br>
She smiled at her husband, stroking his face softly. Gazing down on him. &quot;Husband, I was never alone.&quot; A quizzical look ran across the barbarian's face. &quot;Minz is about,&quot; she whispered. &quot;He has been watching over me. Over there.&quot; She looked directly at him, nodding.<br>
<br>
The shock of it made him fumble. Falling back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come out little shadow. Come on.&quot; She piped in her sweet elven voice. He stepped out from behind the tree.<br>
<br>
Jaw agape.<br>
<br>
Mom smiles so warmly. &quot;My little protector.&quot; He walked toward the two hesitantly. A look of shock was on his father?s face.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have not. . .? His chest. . .? His hand?&quot; Dad managed to stutter out. Minz looked down, halting where he stood.<br>
<br>
Her soft hand pulled her husband?s eyes to hers. &quot;Thimz. You are the only one who can heal his wounds. Not I.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man gazed at her a moment, the dropped his head solemnly. Taking a deep breath and standing, he covered the short distance between he and his son in a single step. Towering over the boy. Dropping to one knee. Whispering, &quot;Son, I am sorry. I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
He touched a finger to the boy's chest, running it down parallel to the gash. Taking the boy?s small hand in his. Strong meaty fingers closing over his own tiny nimble hand. The old man clenching his eyes shut. Tears slipping out from beneath his eyelids. After a long moment he opened them again. Red rimmed and bloodshot. Dark brown irises with pupils of pitch black. Heaviness emanated from them. A weary aching that could be felt by all around him. &quot;Your mother and I have talked Minz. This will never happen again. Never.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz's lip quivered. And his throat ached with a sudden piercing agony. Tears burst from him and he was in his father's arms. Soft consoling words whispered into his young ear. He felt himself being lifted.<br>
<br>
Cradled in mighty arms.<br>
<br>
Three nights of no sleep finally catching up to him.<br>
<br>
He awoke in his bed.<br>
<br>
It was dark.<br>
<br>
A rough hand caressed his face. His father sat in a chair next to him. &quot;Shhhh. Go back to sleep boy. You're a good boy. Takin? good care of your momma. Momma's lil shadow. That's whacha are. You make me proud son.&quot; Minz closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
The bandages were still there. . .<br>
<br>
. . .damp with blood.<br>
<br>
But things were healing.<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
The sounds seemed to well up about him. Starting as mere background to the somnolent images floating across his minds eye. Familiar voices grafting themselves into dreams.<br>
<br>
Murmurs in the background.<br>
<br>
Words slowly taking shape . . . voices drifting into sharp focus.<br>
<br>
It was dark. . . soooo dark. The blackest night he had ever seen.<br>
<br>
A soft tune seemed to weave itself on the air's loom.<br>
<br>
&quot;. . .CHIN CAMARO, BITCHIN CAMARO<br>
Now it's in all the papers.<br>
<br>
My folks bought me a BITCHIN CAMARO<br>
with no insurance to match;<br>
So if you happen to run me down,<br>
please don't leave a scratch.<br>
<br>
I ran over some old lady<br>
one night at the county fair;<br>
And I didn't get arrested,<br>
because my dad's the mayor.<br>
<br>
BITCHIN CAMA?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;mmmmmmm. . . Rach? Is that you?&quot; Minz murmured.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome back Minz. We've been worried.&quot; Rachella's melodic voice floated to him. &quot;Jing! Syl!&quot;<br>
<br>
Footsteps.<br>
<br>
First in the sand, then on planks. One set light. . . faint . . . Clearly the step of a thief. Jing. The second . . . firm and steady. Must be Syl.<br>
<br>
His body began to assert itself over him. Aching muscles sending long slow cries of pain through his limbs. Stiff from disuse. Yet to weak to be used. His mouth had a dry bitter taste to it. Lips seemed stretched and cracked. Simmering waves of heat emanated from his skin. Flowing both outward and inward. Sweating under the sting, yet shivering at the slightest breeze.<br>
<br>
But the haze of his fever seemed to have receded. Though his body ached, his thoughts were clear. All that remained were the flickering after images. Pieces of dreams. Sinking back into the netherworld from which the came.<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome back buddy.&quot; Syl said. &quot;Here.&quot; Minz turned his head toward the voice. His neck aching in protest. A hand slipped under his neck . . . turning and raising his head.<br>
<br>
Pottery brushing to his lips . . . a cup . . . cool water. He tried to raise his hands. To hold the cup. But, they fell limply back to the cot he was on.<br>
<br>
He gagged and coughed. Trying to gulp down too much. Aching spasms wracked his chest. Some one helped him sit up. Holding him steady as his wind pipe cleared. Laying him down softly once he had his breath. A few deep breaths and he was OK. &quot;Why doncha light a candle or something Syl. I can't see a thing. And where's Jez? We were hunting together yesterday. . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
The silence seemed to stretch on.<br>
<br>
A dull sinking feeling came over him. Worry. . . . did something happen to her?<br>
<br>
Please no please.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you there? Jing? Rach? What's wrong? Where is Jez?&quot;<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
'Gods!' he thought. 'Blind? What use is a blind thief?' The image of the old man beggar in Qeynos flashed across his mind. . . . that's what happens to blind thieves. That or worse.<br>
<br>
His mind tumbled over the possibilities. Plotting the inevitable course of his downfall. He had already fallen so far. Failed so many people in so many different ways. This was in all likelihood the inevitable end. Or the last step before the end.<br>
<br>
It was night. Or at least he supposed it was. He could hear the regular breathing of Rachella and Sylavn. Jing was awake. Near the door as far as he could tell. Shifting softly from one foot to another. His slim dagger making soft whisping sounds as he tossed it in the air. Thwapping the palm of his hand as he caught it once again.<br>
<br>
Outside the wind blew over the sand. It was a shimmering sound. Like tiny feet skipping over a marble plate.<br>
<br>
,. . .I hope Jezeran is OK . . .'<br>
<br>
And now this . . .?<br>
<br>
He reached up to his face with both hands, dragging his nails from his forehead to his chin in a hateful manner. Making a sound like heavy fabric being ripped. Warm droplets of blood slipping down his face. The taste of iron on his lips.<br>
<br>
'useless . . . that's what a blind assassin is . . . useless. . . better off to use my art on myself. To slit my own throat rather than to suffer the long drawn out free-fall of death that living so promises.' He struggled to sit up. Hands on his shoulder and behind his back. Helping him sit upright. &quot;Thanks Jing,&quot; He whispered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh? How did you . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz smirked. &quot;You need to bathe brother. Plus I heard you.&quot; He swore he could hear the color rising to the young rogue's face. &quot;I want to go outside. I want to go into the ocean.&quot;<br>
<br>
He planted a palm on Jing's shoulder and pushed up.<br>
<br>
Jing protested. &quot;Minz . . . it's late, and you should rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am going to the ocean. Help me or don't.&quot; Jing sighed, taking his arm and leading him into the night air. The sand felt good under his feet. Soft. . . squishing through his toes. The roar of the waves was growing louder. 'Tides coming in . . . good.' &quot;I got it from here brother.&quot; He patted Jing's hand and walked on, leaving the young elf behind.<br>
<br>
Foam liking at his toes, now his ankles. Soaking the cotton pants he wore. Up to his waist.<br>
<br>
Jing yelled something. &quot;Its OK buddy!&quot; he yelled back. Wading deeper and deeper.<br>
<br>
He stopped . . . feeling the currents wash around him. Swaying with the oceans eternal motion. The ocean sounds so different now. Feels so different. Sounded so much richer. He had missed so much it seemed. There was a splashing behind him. . . Feet running into the ocean . . .Jinghizu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything OK Minz?&quot; Jing said trying to catch his breath.<br>
<br>
Minz pondered the question. Thinking of what he'd lost, but also of what he'd gained. &quot;I don't know Jing.&quot;<br>
<br>
_____<br>
<br>
The thief sat up.<br>
<br>
A week had passed since Sylavn had found him baking in the desert. Most of which he had spent in this cot. Regaining his strength. Strength that the sun had burnt out of him. The rest had done him good. Muscles no longer ached. The blisters and peeling of his skin had faded. Everything had returned to normal.<br>
<br>
Everything save his sight.<br>
<br>
A message had come yesterday. The messenger had searched for some time. Knowing that the Pendragon was last seen in Oasis. Eventually the young bard found Jing. Or more likely, Jing found him. And the missive delivered.<br>
<br>
Rach read the brief note. Minz chuckled ruefully to himself. 'Ironic,' he thought. 'just as I am beginning to grasp the meanings of letters and written words, sight is taken from me.'<br>
<br>
The message was brief. Legadas and Lady De Felwith were proceeding with the Dragon's expedition to Odus, and the Warrens. This was well. They were good men and women. It pleased him to see his officers seeing their plans through.<br>
<br>
But it he was the leader of the Order of Elder Dragons. He was their Pendragon. And he was bound to be there if he could.<br>
<br>
He would expect no less of any Dragon.<br>
<br>
Most especially himself.<br>
<br>
&quot; I need to get to the Warrens&quot; Minz stated under his breath. &quot;I need to get to the Warrens.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz,&quot; Rach's melodic voice was unmistakable. &quot;you're in no shape to travel. And we must stay here for the time. Wait a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sitting up slowly. Sightless eyes surveyed the surroundings. &quot;No.&quot; was his flat reply.<br>
<br>
He had learned much over the last week. How much sound there was in the world. So much never heard by most. Echoes and whispers that slipped by the ears of the world. This was how the blind beggar he knew as a child could walk the streets of Qeynos and not bump into things.<br>
<br>
Smacking his leg with a hand. Reaching to the small table next to the bed where his armor lay. Donning it slowly . . . methodically. Each piece known by heart.<br>
<br>
Planting his feet firmly, hand resting on the hilt of his dagger, he stood up. Harpoon held at his side. &quot;I am goin!&quot; he said flatly. &quot;Come with me if ya like.&quot; He rapped the heal of his spear on the floor, measuring the room by the sound. Stepping around the chair &amp; out the door.<br>
<br>
Whispers behind him. Rachella to Jinghizu.<br>
<br>
The sand made it harder to navigate, but not impossible. Taking long strides. Heading South to Southern Ro &amp; the wizard spires.<br>
<br>
Footsteps . . . one set . . . soft and slow.<br>
<br>
A scent on the wind<br>
<br>
Minz whirled about, thrusting the blunt end of his harpoon out behind him and swinging it low in a wide lightening fast arch.<br>
<br>
The impact to his shadow's knees was almost immediate, sweeping the shaft up, he sent his pursuer tumbling to the ground.<br>
<br>
He continued the turn, spinning the weapon quickly over his head.<br>
<br>
Bringing the business of his harpoon down . . . over where his opponent ought to lie.<br>
<br>
Hanging the point . . . deadly and venomous inches over his friend Jinghizu's chest.<br>
<br>
Panting . . .breath coming in adrenaline filled rushes &quot;You'll have to do better than that Jing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OK,&quot; Jing said from the ground, bit to the left of where he was aiming. Panting himself. &quot;So you can hear me. So what! A single opponent, you'd be fine. . . maybe. What about 2 . . . 3 or a dozen? What happens when you are swarmed.&quot; Jinnghizu's words flew at him in a rapid staccato pace. &quot;Ones you could easily dispatch when you could see! What happens then!?&quot; Jing shouted. Anger filling his voice with deep rough undertones. &quot;You'll get your ass kicked is what will happen!! You dolt!&quot; Minz heard Jing take a deep breath. He planted his harpoon in the sand, letting his fellow thief rise to his feet. &quot;You're no good to the Dragons dead, Minz. No good to anyone dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz sighed heavily. Jing was right. He might get the jump on a single lesser opponent. But more than that? He didn't know. &quot;Then take me to the spires. I shall find passage to Odus. Once there I shall have some one escort me to the Warrens.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz . . . why don . . . &quot;<br>
<br>
But Minz cut him off sharply. &quot;Take me or I shall find my own way.&quot; Turning back to the South, starting back on his trek.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK . . . ok.&quot; Jing replied. Acceding grudgingly. Muttering under his breath &quot;Stubborn ass.&quot; He muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I heard that!&quot; Minz snapped. <p>Minz Elandril<BR>
Pendragon to the Order of the Elder Dragons<BR>
