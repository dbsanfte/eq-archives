This is the quickest and easiest way to get it, and this skips a lot of unnecessary quest steps that you would otherwise have to suffer through.<br><br>1) Buy a cloth shirt from a vendor in Freeport.  It cannot be a small one.  Head out to East Commonlands and find Altunic Jartin in or near a hut across from the third Inn.  Give him the cloth shirt and he will give you a token of generosity.  While out there, buy a spider venom sac from a vendor or kill a desert tarantula in North Ro and loot one.<br><br>2) Go to the Hall of Truth in Freeport and find Merko Quetalis, who is in the backyard outside.  Give him the spider venom sac.  He will give you a token of bravery.<br><br>3) Give Merkos both the token of generosity and the token of bravery.  He will tell you  your final opponent awaits you in the sewer.  Jump down in the water, and right inside the tunnel you will see Guard Willia.  DO NOT WASTE TIME!  Quickly run up to her and kill her.  She is about level 12.  If you wait too long or miss her too much, she runs down the tunnel and zones and you will have to start all over at the first step.  Loot her corpse and get the token of truth.<br><br>4) Give the token of truth to Merkos and receive your Testimony of Truth - the first of the four components needed to receive your soulfire.<br><br>5) Go to the Seafarer's Roost in East Freeport - the bar past the dock.  Sometime during the night only (happened around 5am game time for me)  Tykar Renlin will spawn on the side of the bar.  He has the same character model as a Madman from North Ro.  Give him 4 Drom's Champagnes, they can be purchased right at the bar. If your KOS to the vendor have anyone buy four and hand them to you.  Do this quickly, as he will despawn after a short while. You will receive a blanket after giving him the 4 Drom's Champagne.<br><br>6) Go out into the newbie area outside of the East Gate and kill trash to get several fire beetle's eyes, rat's ears, and snake scales.  You need to make edible goo (cooking) and bog juice (brewery).  Go to Trader's Holiday in East Freeport - they have an oven and a still.  You do not need skills in cooking and brewery to make this work - but if you do it may be easier.  I made edible goo the first try, it took me three tries to make bog juice - and I had NO skills in either of these trades.<br><br>Edible Goo recipe:  Put one fire beetle eye and one rat ear in the oven and click combine.<br><br>Bog juice recipe:  Buy a bottle from the bar.  Put one water flask, one bottle, and one snake scale in the still and press combine.<br><br>7) Go find Zimel in the jail cells under the Arena.  He is locked in the first cell and mutters gibberish occasionally.  His name does not appear above his character.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Give him the blanket first.  Next, give him BOTH the edible goo and the bog juice at the same time.  Zimel will give you a key marked H.K. 102.<br><br>9) Go to the bank in Highhold Pass.  Hand the female bank clerk the key.  She gives you a note to deliver to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw.<br><br>10) Time to do faction building!  It is very important to build up the necessary faction to the Priests of Life first, which is Brother Hayle's faction.  Go to Qeynos, head to the bank in South Qeynos and get about 1600 in GOLD pieces.  Go back into North Qeynos, and head to the vicinity of the Temple of Life, near the caster's UFO looking teleport to their respective guilds.  Roaming around you will find Nashun Novashine.  He may be outside the city gates or in front of the Monk guild as well.  Hail him and start giving him 2 gp at a time.  When you first con him you will be either apprehensively (I was) or indifferent.  It took me about 2 hours and nearly 1600 gp total, 2 at a time to get him to con me as WARMLY - where it needs to be. The order is:  scowls, threateningly, dubious, apprehensively, indifferent, amiably, kindly, and finally warmly.  Stop after every 10 or so gives to hail him to prevent him from walking off.  By the way, he gives you a light heal each time, and it SAYS you gain exp (It did to me at lvl 32 anyway).  But I noticed no difference on my xp bar after the entire ordeal. If he cons warmly, so will Brother Hayle in Splitpaw.  Warmly may be overkill, and I have heard that kindly is good enough, but no sense in risking it.  And if you decide to do the Aegis of Life quest someday you will need high warmly Priests of Life faction anyways.<br><br>11) Note:  This part can be skipped and done along with step 14 if you wish - however doing it now will not cause you to make the mistake of handing in the wrong note when the time comes to get your Soulfire.  Off to Splitpaw (no, you aren't getting Soulfire this trip….)  Recommend taking a wizard or druid with you who can cast See Invisible on both of you and then Invisibility on both of you after zoning into Splitpaw.  Go to the jail.  Open the outer door of the jail by clicking on the wall switch on the right side of the door.  Once inside and the door closes, you are safe from NPC's attacking.  Hayle is in the last cell.  The switch to open his cell is on the right side in the middle of the jail.  Uninvis yourself by casting a spell - you cannot trade to Hayle while invisible due to the fact that he will con you indifferent.  Once he can see you, you will con warmly if you did the faction raising in the last step.  Have your partner STAY OUTSIDE Hayle's cell or you will both get locked in!!  (Not a problem if your partner can TP you out)  He can open the switch for you when you are done.  Give Hayle the note given to you by the bank teller.  He will hand you back another note.  You now have the second component needed to get the Soulfire.  You will be returning to Hayle at the end - he is the one who gives you the fine weapon.  Either invis and run out or if you have a wiz or druid, TP out.<br><br>12) Now the tough part.  You need two tough kills.  The first is Sir Lucan in the militia house in Freeport.  Get a lot of high level friends to help you kill him.  When he dies, his ghost spawns and you must kill it too.  Loot the undead version's corpse, and you will get Lucan's testimony.  Take it to Valeron Dushire in the Hall of Truth and you receive the Brilliant Sword of Faith - the third component needed for Soulfire.<br><br>13) The last kill is a Shadowknight Troll in Castle Mistmoore named Xicotl.  Again, gather your high level friends.  He spawns in the bath room just past the gargoyle room to the left through the fake wall when entering through the jail.  His PH is a Mistmoore Guard.  Kill him and receive the Glowing Hilt from looting his corpse.<br><br>14) Travel one last time to Splitpaw to visit Brother Hayle.  Be sure to cast a spell to drop your invisibility first once safely inside the jail!  Hand him the four components together:<br><br>1) The note Hayle gave you back<br>2) Your &quot;Testimony&quot;<br>3) The Brilliant Sword of Faith<br>4) The Glowing Hilt<br><br>Congratulations on receiving your Soulfire!!<br><br>Authored by Kalorad Valrexxaeus<br>Paladin of Tiarcs, Luclin server<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A> at: 4/11/02 10:44:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uranndragonsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rann Dragonsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/3/01 10:30:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulfire Quest</span><hr size=1> Nice walkthough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Just a couple notes from when I did it.  You only need a high amiable faction to do Soulfire.  Once you get it to kindly that is good enough.  One way to check to see if you have enough faction is hand the note from the teller to Brother Hayle and get the new note back.  You do not need any better than indifferent to do this, apprehensive might work, but I did it with indifferent.  Then hail him and say &quot;What proof of nobility?&quot;  If he answers with the 4 things you need for Soulfire, then you have high enough faction.  If he says he cannot trust you yet, then you need to work on it.  Just a little check to make sure it really is high enough.<br><br>One other thing to note.  If you multi-quest it, all the people involved must have high enough faction.  If anyone hands in an item that does not, then that item is just eaten (and maybe all the items handed in before it).  But on the up side, Brother Hayle will hold the other 3 items for 2 hours while you go back to Freeport and kill Sir Lucan again for another Brilliant Sword of Faith.<br><br>As for Sir Lucan, a group of 4 L55+'s can take him, we had myself (paladin), a cleric, wizard and shaman and the cleric only used a couple complete heals on me during the battle.  A full party of L50's can do it, but if no one is above 50, then I suggest 2 parties.  We always pull Lucan to the Northwest corner of the newbie zone and kill him there.  I do the pulling with Divine Aura (to get past the gate guards alive) and then zone out in that corner.  Then someone non-KOS hails him until everyone goes away.  Then we kill him.  If Brother Jentry (cleric friend to Lucan) shows up, our cleric just fears him until both Lucans is dead.  We usually keep all KOS people in the secret tunnel until ready to kill him.  This has worked will for us 5 times now with no deaths at all.<br><br>I hope this helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p><img src=http://members.home.com/lordarthur/rannsig.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugowrygabriev.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gowrygabriev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/9/01 3:18:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soulfire Quest</span><hr size=1> One thing to note..on faction.<br>I handed in the cloth shirt and he says something<br>about not trusting me...to gain faction you must<br>kill orcs in EC and WC to get faction with the <br>Knights of Truth.<br><br>sigh...on a good note I did kill the live version<br>of Grimrot this weekend!!!
