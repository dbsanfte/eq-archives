I was stunned at the response, both here and through emails, that so many of you have sent to me.  Thank you.  I always believed that the relationships we form in this game are the greatest draw, more than any loot or level, and these warm responses - for me anyway - are an indication of success.  It leaves me with a very good feeling as I close the Everquest chapter in my life.<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed the reawakening of my real life, and all it held for me in reserve while I escaped with you for the past two and a half years.  Jagriel was a true extension of myself, as are your characters, and the investment was great.  The sacrifice, of course, are the parts of you that cannot be exercised in a fantasy world, and a deep part of me always mourned that loss.  My primary reason for leaving is simply this feeling of loss becoming greater than my desire to exist as Jagriel, and toward the end I knew it was time.<br>
<br>
It is the people I have met, and the relationships I have formed, that I do and will miss, and it is this truism that proves to me that the bonds we develop with each other are what make Everquest a potentially eternal game.  Regardless of this, I can say with absolute certainty, that I will not be returning.  Again, I thank you for your blessings in my &quot;new&quot; life.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to post my gratitude and best wishes for some special people I have met during my time as Jagriel:<br>
<br>
The Zan Fi Monks, particularly Rakol (Embar), Aaia, Eise, Nagasakee and Kaiche, who in our founding days helped me forge a guild I will always be proud of.  I remember the sadness I felt when I realized that the natural evolution of the server was gradually making our primary guild purpose (helping new monks) extinct, and yet the code of honor, and the work we did helping so many people, monk or not, helped solidify a foundation of spirit that carried through to many people and many parts of the server.  The Festival of Fists, the Dragon Egg Event, Monk Dungeon Training Raids, Free Cured Armor Saturdays, and on.  I thank you for all that you taught me, and especially the loyalty of all members which is without compare.<br>
<br>
My most ancient friends and hunting partners, from the level 12 mammoth hunting in Everfrost to big raids together in our 60s: Jeygo and Moxwind.  Powergamers with heart, I learned much from you both.  <br>
<br>
While I'm in the summer of '99, thanks Goat for the sandals you gave me when we were both under level 10.  I've always thought it was a point of irony that we had such a relatively insignificant meeting in North Ro that day, and both went on to do the things that we have done.  Best of luck leading SR; I have always found you to be fair and skilled.<br>
<br>
Veranon, my only regret is that we were never guilded together in all our days playing.  Many agree with me when I say you are a fountain of gaming wisdom, and the best part is that you temper it with humility.  Hall of fame shaman and person.<br>
<br>
As a break in the thank you chain, some FU's: FU PoF! for the 10 hour CR and two levels lost during my first raid there; FU kobolds! for the time I heard kobolds outside my window at work because I did King room in Sol B for 18 hours straight; FU Raster! FU the VP key guy in TT near Sebilis! FU Tailoring!  and a big Double FU Stormfeather!  and FU Ulath! =) <br>
<br>
Thank you Zyph/Cyros/Phatsk; we share many philosophies my friend.  You are the only person I know who can fully relate to the leadership conflicts I experienced late in my Everquest life.  Thanks for the talks, the good times hunting together, and all of your work in the developmental stages of Elysian.  Best of luck with LoH, I already know you are a fine leader and a great friend.<br>
<br>
Eise, who has sent me more /hug tells than all others combined, I sincerely mean it when I say that you have the biggest heart in the game.  Your friendship sustained me through many rougher times: thank you so much for all of our talks.<br>
<br>
Embar/Rakol, with whom I have one of the strongest bonds.  The Spirit of the Haruchai.  I can never thank you enough for your inspiration and close close friendship.  My philosopher brother, and trivia master, we'll be on your boat in Diego soon enough (when the tuna are plentiful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Gromb, I have a sack for you, and you have a song to sing.<br>
<br>
Reyek, the best man at both of my RL weddings, a friend of almost 30 years, the guy who when I punched him in the nose in the park when we were 11 years old, pinned me down and blew blood all over my favorite shirt: after which we both laughed our asses off, the friend who started playing Everquest because he missed seeing me IRL, and has become an outstanding bard and leader in his own right, I look forward to partying with you Saturday night, and beyond.<br>
<br>
Razide, who was a great friend and hunting partner long before Elysian, and misunderstood by many, thank you bro for your honesty and loyalty.  Some of my best times in this game involve Jag and Trancer.  Good luck taking over the guild website and message board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Maya, who despite our rough final words to each other, remains in memory one of the best friends I could have asked for in game.  The amount of things we accomplished together is a source of pride, and to think it started with me threatening to break your legs if you screwed the Zan Fi on jewelry prices lol.  You are an outstanding raid leader, a fun person, a horny bastard, and an unrelenting joker.  I wish you the best guiding Elysian.<br>
<br>
My Everquest family of Elysian, founded on friendship and loyalty, thank you so much for the great times I enjoyed with all of you over the past year.  I had a blast working together to build a new guild into a strong family.  Blearg!<br>
<br>
Finally, thanks to my wife who was damn cool about my EQ habit for my over 200 days played, and was actually worried about my state of mind when I told her I had quit:  I always pictured her leaping for joy at that moment lol.  Sagapo melimou Voula.<br>
<br>
Be well, all.  May your time in Everquest bring you the joy and fulfillment I was fortunate enough to receive.<br>
