Obviously, Verant has not built a reservation system into EverQuest.  Therefore, by default, there can only be intentions.  However, that doesn't mean that we, the players, can't treat those intentions like reservations.  <br>
<br>
It sounds like some players respect intentions as if they were reservations.  Others treat postings to the raid intentions forum as mere recruiting calls; if you want to show up at a spawn before, or even the same time as, another group, then go for it.  Is that latter situation really what we want on Brell?<br>
<br>
Is there some set of standards that Brell players have adopted in the past that we need to be reminded of (I couldn't find them, so please enlighten me if you know of them)?  If not, let's use this thread to define a set of standards.  Here are some criteria to consider so that we don't turn into a chaotic FFA server:<br>
<br>
An intention should be treated as a virtual reservation when some or all of the following are true:<br>
*  The mob spawns longer than a certain time period (2 hours?  4 hours? etc.).<br>
*  A combined level total of XXX is generally required to take down, or reach, the mob.<br>
*  An extremely rare/epic quest/no drop/etc. item drops from the mob.<br>
<br>
There are probably more criteria that should be considered.  Please suggest some.  Also, please comment on how virtual reservations can be made and honored.  Obviously, first-come-first-served is the best, but should there also be a requirement that the posting person have an adequate group formed before the intention becomes a reservation?  That would allow multiple people to post intentions and then the first to have the requisite number of people sign on (in the forum) gets the reservation.<br>
<br>
Or am I totally out-of-touch with everyone and can I start organizing a Plane of Air raid without regard of anyone else's intentions?  If so, please be sure to post when you're planning on raiding Air so I can be sure to get my group there before you do...<br>

<br>
I'm feeling that perhaps intentions isn't such a good idea.  I know that our guild got confused and treated them as reservations of sorts -- especially considering the fact that Phin was stuck on the calender.<br>
<br>
The understanding now is that intentions carry no weight as far as &quot;ownership&quot; of a spawn for a time period, and they are essentially sign up sheets.  Why not just call it signups?<br>
<br>
&lt;OPINION&gt;<br>
Personally I kinda wished some of the bigger mob intentions carried some weight.  Sure, I agree that intentions on bosses that take one group doesn't make sense.  But ones like Master Yael or CoM that require more than one group(leading to public signups for smallish guilds) leads to some pretty heavy organizational effort.  It'd be a shame to waste 1-3 days getting people to sign up and find out &lt;Uber Guild&gt; decided it was their day that day.  <br>
<br>
The whole reason Brell made the planes and dragons reservable was due to the time and organizational efforts that it takes to put one on.  This is a boon to smaller guilds that don't have the resources to quickly form up raiding parties.  As we know, there are some mobs that take close to or equal amounts of effort, so why not accord those mob/raids the same distinction?  Then again, you could argue against planes reservations using pretty much the same argument.<br>

We've never had this issue ever come up before in the 4 or so months we've been raid-level.  It was mainly the fact that after stating that we had put our intentions to Vailen, he basically came back with the attitude of, so what.  Granted, after all this discussion here he was probably within his rights, but if he's one of your guys that always &quot;bends over backwards to respect intent&quot; then he sure didn't show it this time.<br>
<br>
To her credit, Altte apologized on behalf of Val.  But it was his attitude (again, probably rightfully thrown given the fact that intentions mean squat) that precipitated the original post.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, this thread seems to be about the validity (or invalidity) of raid intentions.  It appears the consensus is that intentions have no meaning whatsoever.  Anyone care to rebutt?<br>

ROFL.  If we had FCFS as a standard on this server you would be here in one month complaining that you can't kill anything because SR, Enshadowed, Watchers, LoH, Elysian, and a few others are able to organize and take down everything as soon as it pops.  Funny its never those guilds that want FCFS even though they would clearly benefit, its the ones that would be zoning in to find the mob dead, loot distributed, and the groups on the next mob 4 zones away already.<br>
<br>
Do you honestly think that if we went FCFS on Venril Sathir or Trakanon that you would EVER see him live more than an hour?  Want to see what a highly skilled and highly organized guild can do on a FCFS server?  Go look at www.afterlifeguild.org and check out the raid points list for the leader.  Look at the dates and times of all their major kills.  They kill VS nearly instantly on spawn.  Trakanon, Hoskar, Silverwing, Severilous, etc etc etc all live maybe an hour or so.   You think you could compete against some of our best guilds in a FCFS system?  I certainly wouldn't want an FCFS system and have to compete even against just SR and Enshadowed.  Throw 4 or 5 other skilled guilds in there and every mob is dead before you could even get to the zone.  Luckily the ones that would benefit the most from a FCFS system want to share and be fair to those that aren't able to be as effective as they are.<br>

The mere fact someone posted something gives them a sense of ownership where its not warranted. No forum, no issue. You walk over, see if someone is there and if they are you wave to them and go someplace else.<br>
Otherwise make it a reservation. and call it that, and set it up like the rest of the system. Just call a duck a duck. <br>

/agree maryinn  <br>
<br>
It's too bad ppl have changed the definition of what intentions once was.  But I agree that one can post something in general and have ppl go to their website to sign up or maybe the word intention can be eliminated and it could be ...group sign ups.  If anyone types in their post that they are reserving that spawn, it gets deleted.  hehe dunno..just playing around with words.<br>

The only things we have decided are reservable are listed under dragon raids and plane raids as seperate forums (hate, sky, phear, nag/fgs, vox, trak, venril).  That's it.  If you go to kill Phinny and he's dead, go somewhere else, he'll be up another time.  If you're going to Chardok to kill the Prince and there's someone there, go elsewhere, he'll be up again.  It's sooo simple.  <br>

Why do people have no problem with this concept when it involves the Myconid King or the Efreeti or the Disco in Sebilis or the Lord in Guk, but when it involves something only slightly harder (phinny, royals etc) people don't get it... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1268.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1268.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1287.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1285.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1268.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1268.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1268.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
