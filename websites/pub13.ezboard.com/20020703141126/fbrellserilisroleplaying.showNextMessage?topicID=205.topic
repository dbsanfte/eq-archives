First off her true name is Yshaa K'Arlah, but myself and a few remaining supporters changed it, her sister, and her cousin's names to hide them from the The Dead.  But Kaylanu must follow the Dead, for her eyes are my eyes and I want to see this through.<br>
The K'Arlah family had some dark days before, but this day was beyond any of their comprehension.  This was the day her great family of 27 withered down to a mere 3.<br>
Yshaa's father, Kilernicus, was a necromancer many admired.  He had the power and the great devotion all Tier'Dal did to their Dark Prince.  However, he was very skeptical of the hidden agendas the Lodge of the Dead kept from the public.  During a late night of studies, he overheard a conversation in the adjoining room.  Always curious, he decided to investigate.  What he found horrified him he found a Tier'Dal peasent's corpse on a table and the face of one of Innoruuk's avatars hovering over it.   The conversation they were having was the confirmation of his horors.<br>
It seemed the king of the Tier'Dal was plotting against Lanys TVyl, daughter of Innoruuk.  He was outraged for his family greatly supported Innoruuk's blood daughter born of mortal flesh.  The next decision he made rocked history in Neriak forever, but none shall remember for all but this document have been destroyed.  Kilernicus decided to announce this meeting to all Neriak, and he did.  The following day, they marched on the Lodge of the Dead, that is, the whole K'Arlah family and the supporters of Lanys.  The Necromancers and Shadowknights all suppoted the king's decision, the clergy of the towers of the Spurned supported Lanys.  It was a tremendous battle that ended in all of the king's opposer's to be turned to ghouls forced to ever guard the very place they marched on, and Kilernicus himself was turned to stone and sent to the very plane Rallos Zek was banished to.  Everyone else's memories have been erased except mine.<br>
Only I and the three youngest members of the K'Arlah family survived, I place them in three serparate guilds of magic. Enchanter, Cleric, and Shadowknight.  after writing this I shall place my soul, memories removed in Kaylanu's body then have my messenger take her, or me, to the Lodge of the Dead.  I warn you Kaylanu, that when you reach maturity, You will feel the need to question, but do not follow in your uncle's footsteps.<br>
I had my messenger place this letter deep within the tomb of Befallen and placed a spell that forever bound his soul there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yshaa puts the letter down and turns to Kaylanu.<br>
&quot;I guess you shoudl listen to your mother, Kaylanu,&quot; Yshaa tells her.<br>
&quot;My...mother?  How do you know?&quot; Kaylanu looked at Yshaa, mystified.<br>
&quot;Hmhm, she was wrong, this isn't the last document from that time, Perrir showed me a letter of recomendation that my aunt wrote, it's a perfect match, besides, my father had only one sister and my mother was an only chile, remember?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I see&quot; Kaylanu says looking downcast.<br>
