flows through the lands of the Great Divide.  A small tear glimmers and causes a trail of crystals as it moves over her cheek.  She thinks back over the past few months of turmoil in her life.  Wondering about the signs of love she had seen, then thinking of the ones that she had seen but refused to acknowledge.  Silent tears continue to fall as she prays to Erollisi Marr, wondering how she could have failed the Lady that blessed her days. <br>
<br>
Slowly her heart fills with pain as she continues to live in what she experienced, refusing to let go of it.  Missing her friends with her self-imposed exile in the ice worn lands has only allowed her to bury the pain, not to deal with the loneliness.  She curls up in her cloak and lays on the snow watching the people come and go below her.  The cold creaps inside even the warmest of cloaks and helps her slip off into the slumber of the dreamless.<br>
<br>
But her time in Norrath was not meant to end this way.  The Lady, Erollisi Marr, feels her heart and the pain and ice that encompasses it.  Behind the bard's closed eyes comes a shining light moving towards her.  &quot;Stand and receive me my child.&quot; The Lady's warm and melodious voice fills her mind and soul.<br>
<br>
In her dream the bard stands, wearing the type of tunic she had worn while in the temple of her youth. The Lady holds out her hand to the bard. &quot;Why are you wasting yourself my dear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Violet eyes look up to the lady pleadingly, &quot;Why have I failed you so?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have never failed me my child, you are a small light that I love to watch as it moves about in the lands of Norrath.&quot;  The warmth of the Lady's presence fills the bard as they move through the gardens of her dreams.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I was so close to love, only to lose it.  I can not hold to your lessons if I can not share the love I hold in my heart.&quot;  The bard asks, confused in the gifts the Lady has given her.<br>
<br>
Erollisi Marr runs a hand over the bard's short hair, &quot;You are still learning the lessons set before you.  One love lost is not a lifetime of love lost.  You still love your Father and brothers, and many friends.&quot; The bard only nodded as the Goddess examined deep inside her. &quot;Love of a man and woman is only one aspect of love in our lands.  Granted it is one that is very fufilling, but it is not the only type of love you will share.&quot;<br>
<br>
They continued moving and the Lady bestowed a gift that she rarely shared with any others, &quot;You have been a blessing to me and my house since you joined us child, so let me tell you this.  One you look for will return.  One that has been near, will stay but in a different way.  Many loves will be shared as you grow, but one day your heart will be filled in a way that nothing can match.  On that day, you will know the truth of my Blessing.&quot;<br>
<br>
She knelt down to the small bard, tilting her chin so that she could look straight through and into Kestri's heart. &quot;For now you must return and live your life as you have in the past.  Return to the strong woman you have always been. Share your heart with those around you, they deserve no less than all of you.  Any pain that you feel will fade and be replaced with wisdom.   Your friends seek your support, and there are those you have not met yet that  may seek your heart and wisdom.  Until then, I can think of one man that thinks of you daily.  You have much to learn, and it is time for you to fly my songbird.&quot;  She kissed Kestri on the head and with that the dream ended.<br>
<br>
When Kestri awoke she was at the feet of a cleric who had been a good friend to her.  The cleric chanted and filled her body with life and warmth again.  &quot;Kes, I thought we lost you.  I came upon your body in the snow and you were so cold and unresponsive.  It took all my power to bring you back.&quot; Kestri instantly began to sing to fill his strength as he had healed her body.<br>
<br>
The bard spoke with conviction and a wry smile, &quot;You can't get rid of me that easily, I have many things left to do in this world.  And if anyone thinks I will ever be the same, they are wrong.&quot;  The cleric looked at her and saw a spark in her eye.  Not knowing what had happened, but he could see the beauty of one recently touched by the powers of a God or Goddess, he only nodded.<br>
<br>
He smiled to her as she stared down over the water again, &quot;I for one am happy to have your company again.  And many of us would hate to lose your talent and friendship.  So next time, be a bit more careful in these cold lands.&quot;  He asked not what had happened because he knew it would never be what he expected. <p>Kestri the Bard, proud to support meleers and casters everywhere<br>
