A fair, if young, elven woman was gazing at her reflection in the water.  <br>&quot;Opolla!  Pay attention!  Your father will be most upset if I must send you back home, with news you will not be admitted into the ranks of the temple as a cleric of Tunare.&quot;  Sighing, she turned her attention and thoughts back to the lesson at hand.  'Why must I do this anyway?'  she thought...her father was already a prominant person in the temple, with much prestige.  It was his dream to have his daughter follow in his footsteps, and become a priest as he was.  <br>She didn't much want to follow his father's path in life, though.  She has always been more of a tomboy than the other girls, more fitting in with the boys in her classes.  Granted with her mothers high cheekbones, and her fathers piercing blue eyes, she was naturally beautiful, yet always marred with dirt it seemed.  As such, she never fit in with the boys, who viewed her as an oddity, nor the girls who viewed her as an outcast.  <br>The lesson ended, and the class was released for the mid-day meal.  Walking back through the streets of Felwithe, she spotted 2 of the boys in her class, who seemed to be walking behind one of the girls...Nerola, she recognized her as, the daughter of a local merchant.  A very quiet girl, who spent most of her time caring for her sick mother.  It was said her mother was pierced by an orc arrow while on business to Kelethen.  She's never recovered...the priests say it's some type of cursed poison.  As she watched, she saw the boys taunt her mercilessly, each encouraging the other on.  She quickened her pace to catch up with them.<br>&quot;...and your fat pig of a father will never earn enough money selling that lothsome bread of his to catch up to MY father!  Why, if he's lucky, perchance my father will buy your fathers small shop, and pay him a pittance..at least then he'll have SOME money coming in!&quot;  she heard as she got into earshot.  Coming up from behind, she shoved the speaker, who lost his balance from the unexpected shove, and crashed headlong into a barrel of trash.  <br>&quot;Hey!&quot;  The other boy remarked; but before he could say another word, he was hit in the stomach, knocking the air out of his lungs, sending him to the ground.  Turning, she saw the girl standing there, eyes wide in amazement.  <br>&quot;You should learn to stand up for yourself&quot;, Opolla said to the girl.<br>&quot;But Lady Opolla, i am but a simple merchants daughter, I have not the status that you do.&quot;  she said in a low voice.<br>&quot;Nonsense, it matters not your status.  Tis more about pride.&quot;  Watching her, Opolla could see her words were not having any effect, so with a word of tidings, she went about her way home.  Her stomach was growling even more now, after her little excursion with the girls tormentors.  <br>As she walked into her fathers estate, she first saw Latrimis, her fathers chief protector.  She often bothered him to show her some sword techniques, when her father wasn't looking.  A nice enough fellow, but too business-like, she thought.  Did he ever have fun?<br>&quot;Hail, Mistress Opolla, returned from your classes already?  They were beneficial I hope.  Your father is discussing sending you to Kelethin tomorrow in his stead, as his representative, from what I hear.&quot;<br>&quot;Kelethin?&quot;  she shivered at the thought.  Those wood elves are so primitive, she thought.  'How can we even share the same blood?'  Why would her father send her, a simple acolyte, on a trip to the treehouse fortress, as she dubbed it.  Lost in thought, she made her way to the dining area.<br>&quot;Opolla&quot;  her father said, &quot;Excellent, you're just in time for the mid-day meal, it's being served now.&quot;<br>She sat at the table with her father, as the servants brought forth plates with fruits and cheeses, and the delicious elven honey-juice she loved so much.  <br>&quot;Father, what's this I hear about you sending me to Kelethin tomorrow?&quot;<br>&quot;Ah, good Latrimis has a good ear indeed to have heard your mother and I talking.  Yes, tomorrow you will be going in my stead on a religious mission to Kelethin.  You are to meet with Templar Tremzer, and give him this letter from me.&quot;  He handed her over a letter with the seal of her house on it.  &quot;Letrimis will escort you, in case of danger.  I will be leaving for Kaladim at sunrise, in an effort to further Tunare's cause over there.  Aye, those dwarves are stubborn creatures, but I believe I can convert some of them yet.&quot;<br>They ate the rest of the meal in silence, Opolla thinking about her trip tomorrow, and her father reading through some papers.  <br>She spent the rest of the day helping her mother with various chores, and preparing for the next days journey.  As she prepared for bed, she wondered what the wood elf city was really like.  She had only heard stories from her father, since she had never been further than the front gates area.  Lately, she had been thinking about many things such as that:  Norrath is quite a big place, and she wondered what other sites there were to see out there such as the tree-top city.  'Maybe someday I'll get to take a trip off this island' she thought, as her eyelids slowly succumbed to sleep.  <br>The next morning she was awakened by Latrimis, who was eager to set out on their pilgrimage.  Her father had already left for Kaladim.  Her mother helped her get ready, and after their morning meal they left the front gates of Felwithe for the trail leading to Kelethin.  <br>'Wow' she thought, 'I never realized how big the bugs grew out here'  The forest seemed almost alive, and she closed her eyes and took in a deep breath.  Tunare Herself seemed to have a presence in the forest.  <br>They were traveling for about an hour, and Latrimis seemed happy about how far they had come already.  She noticed he was always nervouly eyeing the bushes, and his hand was going to his sword hilt with every twig snap.  <br>&quot;Why, at this rate, we should be to Kelethin before our mid-day meal&quot; he said sounding relieved.  &quot;And we haven't even been bothered by those accursed Crushbone orcs.  They've known to patrol this area from time to time.  Luckily, they're not too intelligent, so they're easy to deal with.&quot;  Nevertheless, he seemed ill at ease, always watching the shrubbery.<br>As they were walking along, Opolla started humming a tune, a light elvish melody, when Latrimis suddenly stopped in his tracks.  She had been walking behind him, and nearly bumped right into him.<br>&quot;Latrimus, what-&quot;  but his hand covered her mouth, preventing her from talking.<br>&quot;Shhh&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Have you noticed the insects have stopped making noise?  Almost as if they fear to be discovered.  I fear we are in dire peril, Mistress.&quot;<br>Almost on cue, Opolla heard a snap of a branch off to her right, then a rustling of leaves off to her left.  Her heart started to race...now that she was aware, and listening to her surroundings, she heard movement in the forest all around. Latrimis' hand went to his hilt, and he slowly started to draw his blade from the scabbard, when things suddenly started to go in slow motion for her. <br>Out of the forest on either side of the trail, hideous creatures, deformed and grotesque, sprang forth.  Some carried old rusted weapons, some attacked bare-handed.  Latrimus had briefed her about the orcs the night before, but never did she think they could be so revolting.  <br>&quot;For Tunare!&quot;  Latrimus shouted as the first of the orcs were cut down by his blade.  But as he fought, it seemed the orcs were multiplying, rather than lessening.<br>'Something is wrong' she thought.  By all reports, orcs are supposed to be dumb, unorganized creatures.  These beasts seemed to have a purpose, a knowledge they shouldn't have.  <br>Her mind raced back to her teachings, and she tried to concentrate her will to call forth Tunare's blessings to heal Latrimus' wounds.  But he seemed to be taking damage faster than she could heal, and her will was tiring fast.  A large orc with a long rusty spear parried his blow, then pierced his shoulder.  Another attacked from his left, and his nails raked across his left arm, making it almost useless.  And still more came. Latrimus was bleeding badly, and he seemed on the verge of collapse.  She panicked, 'What do i do?' she thought.  <br>Suddenly, she heard a bone chilling battle-cry from the shrubbery.  She turned to see a man dressed in a gold armor, with his back to the sun, come charging through the brush.  With maniacal fury, he slashed 2 orcs before they knew he was upon them.  The knights sword seemed to move faster than she could see, always finding it's mark.  The orcs hesitated, taken aback by this new-comers ferocity.  Seeing this, the man pressed his attack - 2, 3 more orcs fallen before they knew what hit them.  The knight fought his way over to where Opolla and Latrimus kneeled, his blade a blur of activity.  When he got in range of them, he reached out his left hand and brushed the tips of his fingers over the shoulder of Latrimus, and said some holy words that even she didn't understand, but seemed to hurt the orcs ears, as they shrank from them.  She gasped in disbelief as Latrimus' mortal wounds faded to nothing more than mere scratches.  With renewed vigor, he lifted his sword again, and both he and the stranger doubled their attack.  The remaining orcs seemed dispirited by this renewed attack, and scattered into the brush, heading back toward Crushbone.<br>&quot;Thank Tunare!&quot;  Latrimus cried.  &quot;A Paladin!  I thought we were doomed for sure.  Tis a mircale you happened along, Lord.&quot;<br>She gaped at this man in golden armor, who had just single handedly saved her and Latrimus, and turned the tide of battle.  His features were elven, yet his eyes were rounder, and his build was thicker.  'A Half-Elf' she thought.  Yet he seemed wiser and more noble than even her father.  Hardly a bastard race as she was taught.  <br>&quot;T-thank you, sir&quot; she stammered, unsure of what to say, or how to act.  <br>&quot;You are most welcome, Lady Opolla.  Yes, don't look so shocked i know your name.  I was dispatched from Kelethin to watch out for you.  We have had some strange reports that the orcs are becoming more organized, and are mobilizing themselves for something.  Tis a good thing I came upon you when I did.  Come, let me escort you the rest of your journey to Kelethin.  It's not far.  There we can rest and get some food.&quot;<br>And so they journeyed to Kelethin together, and the whole trip she questioned this stranger about his ways, and how he became a Paladin.  It reminded her of her childhood hero, Firiona Vie, whom she had not thought about for many years.  After finsihing her business in Kelethin, she and Latrimus headed back to Felwithe the following morning, with a small guard from Kelethin.  She was deep in thought for most of the way.  Finally, Latrimus spoke up.<br>&quot;What troubles you Mistress Opolla?  You have nary said a word this whole trip.&quot;<br>&quot;Oh, my apologies good Latrimus.  I didn't mean to be rude.  I've just been trying to decide how best to break the news to my father.&quot;<br>&quot;What news would that be?  About the orcs?&quot;<br>&quot;No, my friend.  That I have decided to go against his wishes and abandon my studies at the temple, and to enlist in the ranks as a Knight of Tunare upon our return to Felwithe!&quot;<br>Latrimus just smiled, and nodded.  &quot;I think he will understand.  After all, it was he who asked Templar Tremzer to dispatch the Knights to protect you.  I surmise he wanted to introduce you to them, and expose you to different cultures and ideas.  You have come of age now, Opolla, when you must decide what you wish to do.&quot;<br>&quot;I have.&quot; she said, with a fierce look in her eye.  &quot;I have.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=151.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showNextMessage?topicID=151.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.emailToFriend?topicID=151.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.threadControl?topicID=151.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=151.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=151.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern>God's Might</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
