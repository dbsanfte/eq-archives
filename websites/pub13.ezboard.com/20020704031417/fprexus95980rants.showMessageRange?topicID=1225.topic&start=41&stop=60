<br>
You can say adults are just as destructive.  Fact is,  you seemed to be throwing a tantrum in my eyes.  Justify it however you wish, that's how it came off to me and I'm sure other people that were present.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It seems odd that, you developed such and indepth psychosis of the situation, based simply off of one or two shouts.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, as we never discuss anything in guildchat and outside the shouts that were being &quot;performed&quot; by you, I would have had no idea that FA was even in the zone.  Later, I flew my jet to a bank to stop a crime in progress because the commisioner put up the &quot;Dalman Signal&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Interesting how the public channel to discuss a rather public event, was something of such embarassment that you prefered for it to be handled in tells.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Embarassment perhaps for you, not at all for me.  Like I said, it was a source of great entertainment personally and was definitely the highlight of my evening.  I hated the situation at hand due to the fact that I do have friends in FA and deplore any conflicts between us.  Thankfully, you provided some comic relief for us and definitely helped us to keep guild politics from interfering with our friendship.  I imagine in a way I should be thankful to you.  I wouldn't rather you handle it privately at all, I merely stated that it was not a way to handle things for something that doesn't just try to get attention.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'd like to hear how my account of the situation is different than yours, truly. I'd really like to know what type of frame of mind you work working under as you pushed past our raid. I recall in my tells with Nakilos how he noted that KTF &quot;let us have a second shot at Ikky&quot;; when in truth we had killed him on the first shot. In truth we had gathered first in the zone, and indeed were attempting to head north when we got pushed over.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I bet you would.  But again, I'm not going to bother.  The situation was attempted to be handled then, and I even made a special trip to your board at the time, a board I never visit under normal circumstances and tried to iron things out a bit then because I did and still like your guild as a whole.  Needless to say, you didn't exactly make me feel welcome, though other people that posted on the thread did, maybe you should be taking lessons from them.  The offer to discuss the situation with you has expired.  (for me personally)  The people that really make any difference to me are on good terms and that's really all that matters.  I don't loose sleep every night knowing I'm not in your favour.  Guild politics are something that's handled between officers, and I'm not one of those.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I doubt, very much so, that you were speaking with various FA members and they were &quot;laughing&quot; about my outburst. I'd say that every single member, was very frustrated with KTF at that point. It's very interesting how you recall that day as one of amusement, and FA will recall the day as one of unpleasentness. It marked the first time we had out-gathered a guild, and then that guild would push by us because they could. Would push by because they knew that we didn't have nearly the DPS to keep up with them, or to really do anything about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Doubt all you wish, I know my friends within your guild and they know me.  Some I even have plans to meet in person.  What goes on between us is our business at any rate and what you perceive about the members of your guild is your business.  I'll leave it at that.<br>
<br>
ANY guild that KTF has dealt with since I've been in the guild has been treated with respect on any raid I've attended.  Ever.  Including yours, until you became hostile with us.  We've stepped aside for many guilds that have beaten us to the punch, even a couple who hadn't, but wanted to attempt various mobs for the first time.  I'm fairly confident that members of those guilds that have read your comments about how we ran you over to get to our mob dismiss it knowing full well the respect we in truth extend to guilds, whether competitors or smaller than us.  Before joining KTF, I was a very outspoken person against &quot;uber guilds&quot; and people that are in them.  I learned to eat humble pie real fast after raiding with KTF for only a few days at the insistance of a friend of mine.  I, and many others know what the guild is truely about, and what you accuse them of is not what they are about at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> the &quot;Fabulous Flaming Forum&quot; is what FA chooses to do with threads that are flames on our public forum. Yes I know it's KTF's practice to poo poo away such attacks as being low class or something, but we like to have fun with them. The forum I assure you, was created more to hold attacks on us, more than a private place for me to go off about various subjects.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, I'll grant you that.  But at the same time, if hopping on Prexus.com in the past like you had for quite some time to post your weekly flame wasn't an attention-getter, I don't know what is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The flames I created were never random, Dalmask. They were relevant to a situation that was going on at the time. You, trying to paint me as a &quot;Pofis&quot; or &quot;Ajoe&quot; is simply not to fact. The style of posts such as these two generated would be more for attention grabbing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You're right, that's unfair of me.  Pofis and Ajoe's posts were relatively harmless, if misdirected.  Your posts on the other hand are created with the sole intent to hurt somebody's feelings and insult them, possible even damaging their reputation if you feel real spanky that day.  You're indeed in a class of your own Maddie, though I wouldn't want to be in it myself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now we could nit-pick I guess, but then we'd have to call you an attention grabber as well. Your opening reply (after the nonsense, or, attention grabbing perhaps posts?) starts off as if you are performing for the public.

<br>
I never claimed I'm not an attention getter.  I pointed out that you said you were not an attention getter when it seems that's what you excel in doing.  Hell, I'm right up there with a your run of the mill attention whores.  I love the spotlight!  I enjoy making waves and the room is blanketed in silence after saying a particularly shocking line.  I sing in guildchat in the middle of raid or taking a few swigs of booze from one of Dalmask's backpacks just to grab a person's attention.  The difference between us Maddie, is I'm willing to admit it.<br>

Good try Dalmask, but once again I bring forth that little tool called EZboard search.  Now I did a search in both our rant section, and on our public section and was unable to find a single post with your EZboard account associated with it.<br>
<br>
Since we don't delete threads, and it certainly would not have just disappeared, perhaps you could provide a link, to an example of where you tried to come and &quot;iron things out&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It should be said that the only reason this is even being brought up again was because of Chronno's comment.  This issue was long since settled between myself and Kivi, and in addition our guilds have enjoyed a number of pleasent encounters since that day.<br>

In fact, I took the time to actually use the same engine Maddie did and did not find one, but six posts made by me on FA's forum.  Though I admittedly couldn't find my posts on the conflict in ToV, but on a couple threads over a dispute in Skyfire where I took FA's side.  (not that it matters)  Whether scrolling through all the threads on the forum will turn it up or not, I'm not exerting the effort.  I know I made the post.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You may remember the thread as being the longest on the flames board beating a particularly long thread concerning conflicts with EA.  Goodness, you sure have a lot of conflicts!<br>
<br>
Maybe you didn't spell my name correctly?  Or maybe the search engine just didn't pull it up.  Either way, I have no reason to lie, it's not a habit I'm in in r/l, and certainly can't justify going to the effort of mantaining lies for a video game.  Nice try at tossing insults!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
