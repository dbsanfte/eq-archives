Clerics are a classic example.  With their eipc, just a couple of clerics can rez a whole raid without using any manna or needing to med.  Another example is Mages.  Their epic brings them an enhanced ability that they would not have otherwise.<br><br>Our epic is just a weapon that procs a DD.  There are other weapons out there with similar or even better damage/delay ratios.  Some of them even proc a DD.<br><br>I have everything I need for my epic except the dragon books.  At 46-52 my RL schedule prevented me from going on dragon raids, and the guild i am currently in just doesn't do Kunark dragons that much.<br><br>I currently have a weapon with a better damage/delay ratio that even procs a stronger DD.  So I doubt I'll ever get my epic, but I don't think I'm missing much.  A lot of the Paladins in my guild that have epics have put them in the bank in favor of other weapons.<br><br>There's talk and rumors of epic upgrades, but until I see them, I'm not going to lose too much sleep over it.<br><br>If you want your epic because you would feel pride and satisfaction in getting it, and that would be a fun use of your leisure time, then go for it.

But from a satisfaction standpoint- none of them require that much effort.  I have my Fiery Defender, I have an arsenal of 5 weapons I carry in my bags, and it's one of them, only because of the time investment I put in it.  I'm also hoping one day Verant will bump the quest up a notch and make it worth wielding again.  Of course, it'd have to be something like 30:20 with the same stats as a 1h, and the same proc, or 60:40.  /sigh<br>good luck to anyone that hasn't finished the quest.  It's well worth the effort imho. <p><a href="http://casusbelli.tamu.edu/magelo.php?mid=4563"><IMG SRC="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/bl00.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=15032.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=15032.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15032.topic&index=20><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=15032.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=15032.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15032.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15032.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Old World<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">New World<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
