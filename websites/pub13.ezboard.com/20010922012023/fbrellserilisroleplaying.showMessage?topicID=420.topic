His bare chest beat with his heavy breaths as he took in the cool air of the mountain pass. ‘It is almost done,’ he thought to himself as he glanced back into the misty room behind him. Wearing nothing but a pair of loose-fitting leather pants and a small short sword around his waist, he went outside and climbed a small cliff near his store. Sitting down on a flat part of the rock, he crossed his legs and closed his eyes. Exhaling deeply he reflected on the past few months of his life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Leaving his home and family, he had set off to be alone in the usually quiet town of Highkeep and open a shop. Finally at peace with himself he had been able to start the healing process of all the inner-emotion wounds that had been inflicted by so many people in his past. His parents, one who died before he could know her and the other who disowned him as a son and turned his head in disgust to his presence. His heritage, born half-elf yet turned dark elf by some twisted experiment to spy on the Teir’Dal. His wife, who left him and willingly forgot about their marriage and disowned him in a sense as well. But he had overcome these pains, he was a new man now. He was healed both on the outside from his numerous battles and on the inside from the chaos that his life had been.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Climbing back down from the cliff and re-entering the steamy room in his shop, he looked at the red-hot blade laying on the forge. Lifting his hammer with a muscled arm he slammed down upon the metal sending sparks across the floor. Many more times he struck it, making sure the blade was bent and formed just right to his liking. Then, eased the hot blade into the pool of water, and with a cloud of steam the water cooled the metal so that it was no longer malable. He left it in the water a moment and went into his store-front. Reaching under the counter he pulled out his trusty staff. Chuckling slightly as he looked at it, he thought to himself, ‘Ferall used to call this my “whoopin’ stick”.’ Then, taking it by the forge he lifted the the blade out and fastened it to the tip of his staff with rivets that he pounded through the base of the blade with his mallet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Stepping out of the forge room he felt the newly customized staff in his hands. “Ahhh, the enchanted steel Mondi gave me makes it not so top heavy. I can barely feel the difference between this and before, but this sharp blade will cause much more pain in battle,” he spoke aloud as if talking to someone, even though he was alone.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ahhhh, battle. How I miss the smell of blood on my hands, the crush of bones at my feet, and the sweet taste of victory in my mind. I shall return to my family soon, for I am whole for the first time in my life and am ready to rejoin the fight. No longer am I a confused, torn man that is fighting for a different cause every day.<br>
