Almost any emu site has n64 emulators these days.<br>
<br>
While you're there snag ZSNES. Super Mario RPG (ff6/chrono trigger only with Mario) owns too. That series is so underrated, I have to pimp it every chance I get.<br>
<br>
FF7 was really good back in 1997, but it may just be nostalgia, I honestly wouldn't want to play it again as 9 is far superior.<br>
<br>
As for Lunar, I bought the first for psx, and wanted to get the second but never really got around to it. It's ok-pretty good, I liked the plot and music a lot, the battle system is pretty cookie cutter though. It IS a remake of an 8 year old game or something, so I suppose that it's acceptable. If FF is a 10, it's a 7 or so, at least worth a rent.<br>
<br>
By the way, I have a new recommendation. Tomba 1 and 2 for PSX are REALLY GOOD, I forgot about them. Imagine a cross between a rpg, Adventure Island back from SNES, and Klonoa for psx. They are platform game with rpg elements, and really really well done, at least 8/10 on the any game scale. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubarrinsoulburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Barrin Soulburner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>some newbie</span><br>  Posts: 775<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/28/02 1:20:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=619.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do so many ppl hate FF8?</span><hr size=1> thanks nillo<br>

<br>
it just irretated me<br>
<br>
i like 'fun' comic char's <br>
<br>
look at ff9, i fell in love with this game when i first started, this is the direction i would have liked to see the series... there is no reason to change the ff series to the phantasy star type graphics...<br>
<br>
the game play and char. appearence has always been the same on all ff games, until 8 came along and ruined it.<br>
<br>
the level system made the game horrible, period. i 'like' that random running around and leveling crap... <br>
<br>
i like making my char's superior to all mobs, 99 for all, ultimate weapons for all, best magic for all. my friend and i did ffx in 140 hours, sent EVERYONE through the whole sphere grid, and everyone was crazy good. the end of the game was easy, yet you could still find challenges if you wanted(the arena battles are crazy hard period(the 'special creations'))<br>
<br>
<br>
ff8 didnt deserve my time, it just wasnt what i expected. and i hate not being able to pwn @#%$ after being there for a while.<br>

i dont really know how i would explain, but ff8 seemed to try and be more real.<br>
<br>
i look at ffX as a new era of ff, they tried with 8, but that level system, and graphic limitations ruined them... also the magic system was horrible.<br>
<br>
also now that i think of it, ffx the battle system was awesome, no more atb, but your moves would affect how often you got a turn, who went first etc... it is awesome... and then i can leave durng a battle to do something w/o thinking 'did i pause it'<br>
<br>
blitz ball kicked ass too, but got very easy(wouldnt be happy if it was hard though)<br>
<br>
<br>

I HATE ffx's ending, omg it ruined the game for me <p>Frenzy Style<br>

<br>
Ok /rant off, hehe I'm an old school fan. 5 would be my favorite, best storyline imo...however of the new gen 7 is my fav hands down.  Materia was simple but effective as a magic system, it started the epic FMV run for PS (I&quot;m talking hardcore CG, not cheesy movies).<br>
<br>
Mini Game? OMG I spend weeks in the Golden Saucer hehe. Chocobo races, Feed the Moomba..etc, Raising a Gold Chocobo, Ulimate weps...Content galore.<br>
<br>
In FF8...it was all game, game or nothing.  Like you said Barrin, you beat it in 30 hours...you could rush right through it and there was no penalty for that...to me thats not FF.  Drawing was a pain..Ultima and the other kick ass spells were in remote hidden locations where you basicaly NEEED a guide to find (although i was lucky enough to find the hidden island with out one)<br>
<br>
Poofing man said alot of things I agree with...over all I just didnt like the FF8 setting, it was too...Discotech.  I just didnt &quot;feel&quot; for the characters either...they seems bland and emotionless, well they were, lol.  I have no idea why but I was totaly involved with the Cloud/Tifa thing...I dont know if it was the setting, (Blade Runnerish/Future/Post Industrial) but I really felt part of the story...I guess although i play alot of Midevil games, im a sci fi nut at hear, and to me FF7 more accurately portrayed the future than FF8 did.<br>
<br>
The Card Game was fun at first...but it ended up just pising me off...half way though the game i have just about all the cards, even rares and I play to this guy...and he changes the rules on me...it go random..WTF and stupid me I acept the game, next thing I know I've lost my Cid and Half of my Summons.  So I I said screw it and turned the rest of the rare cards into items (which is probaly what ur suposed to do, i beat the game using 100 Heros I got from the Squall Card I believe)<br>
<br>
Ok...now the Trigger Gun and Zells combos were a good idea...but honestly, simplicity is one of the things I like about FF.  Storyline and character development is really what the serries is about...if i want hardcore RPG i play the Balders Gate Series or sumthing.  I wanted to use Zell, but got tired of doing combos, so I stuck to Squall, Questis (omg Blue magic owns), and Rinoa.<br>
<br>
I don't hate FF8 at all...its just my least fav.<br>

But the draw system sucks so much ass it really drags the game down. I never ended up beating it the first run through because of all the monotonous drawing so that my characters would be of decent power.

If you don't have patience to sit down and draw spells, how do you manage a camp in EQ?  Or leveling, for that matter.  That requires patience. (At least it did for me, but as a Cleric I'm not allowed to do much 'cept sit to medd, stand to heal  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Anyway, I don't get where people are saying that the characters of 8 were &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;emotionless.&quot;  Nor do I understand people saying that the realistic look screwed them up.  If anything it helped them out.  I don't mind the characters looking cartooney, but the degree to which 9 took it was way too far.  The characters looked just fine in 7 and 8 both.<br>
Too immaculate?  Have you people played 10??  Good god, talk about something that looks like it was pulled from a disco dance hall.  They're facing a world plagued by Sin, and yet everything is beautiful and bright colors.  I half expected to see a Lava Lamp somewhere in there, or bean bag chairs.  It looked like the bedroom of this acidhead I used to live with... everything was neon and looked like it woulda glowed in the dark.  That bugged the @#%$ outta me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I leveled my characters up to 100 in 8, and didn't have trouble with the super-boss in Ultemecia's castle.  /shrug  Yeah it was tough, but I wouldn't say it was impossible.  Turn the right cards into items, and viola.  He's a pussycat with an attitude for all it matters.  If he can't hit you, he can't hit you.  Plain and simple.<br>
FF5 was...weak.  It was good, but the story lacked something.  I'm thinking it was cohesion, but that could be just me.  it's been a while since I played it.  I liked the concept...in fact when I first played Chrono Cross I was reminded of FF5.  You wanna say Drawing spells in 8 was tedious?  Try getting your people ANYWHERE decent in 5 with the job system.  Talk about a fooking nightmare.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
As for FF Online, (FFXI) from what I've heard there will be 3 playable races, and something like 5 classes.  Including summoners.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If I can be a summoner, I'll drop EQ like a rabid squirrel.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Especially if it works like the job system has in previous games where you can master in one, and learn a few in another class.  Summoner/White Mage.  I'd be all over it.  <br>

it was 'fun' the cartoonie chars with bright colors and atmosphere is a trademark of the series, its always bright colors and such. ff8 just wasnt inline with the rest of the series.<br>
<br>
ff8 was much more phantasy star while 9 and 10 you could tell were both final fantasy.<br>
<br>
its not that i disliked the game(ok i did i couldnt get into it whatsoever), its just it should not have been in the final fantasy series, it should have had its own name, and it would have been fine. <p>Frenzy Style<br>

The latest Baldur's Gate, Dark Alliance, i liked, however; it was way short (took me 15 hours first time...9 hours the second (beat it during an EQ patch when i still played)).

As for recommendations, Strategy-WarSim RPGs always appealed to me more for some reason. I'd personally recommend the following...<br>
<br>
Dragon Force (Saturn)<br>
Final Fantasy Tactics (PSX)<br>
Tactics Ogre (PSX)<br>
Ogre Battle (PSX/SNES)<br>
Shining Force 1 and 2 (Genesis)<br>
<br>
Mystaria for Saturn wasn't too bad either. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

<br>
So 6 (3 on SNES) and 7 didn't fit either?  They were both rather dark and gloomy for most of the game.  Since they weren't bright and cheery they didn't fit in with the FF line?<br>
I'm not opposed to the whole bright neon look, as long as it's in moderation.  8 didn't overdo it, IMO.  In 10 it was a bit much when the screens after battles (The ones that show you how much xp you got, items you won, etc.) look like a fooking scoreboard.<br>
Not saying I don't like 10.  I could just do without the excessive bright atmosphere.<br>
Also...experience and levels are a part of the FF series.  10 doesn't have those.<br>
Character themes were a part of the FF series.  9 didn't have those.  I can go on.  The only REAL thing that is a part of the final fantasy series is the name.  I hated 9.  I'm not yelling about how it shouldn't be in the FF series.  That's not up to me to decide.  That's is entirely up to the creators of the game.  I still have 9 on my shelf, because maybe someday I'll feel like playing it again.  Yes, I did play very far into it, forcing myself all the way, so it's not like I played 5 minutes of it and said it sucked.  If I remember correctly, I was near the end of the third disc.  Anyway...<br>
It's all just a matter of opinion.  But if you don't like the game, don't play it.  Ignore its place in the FF series if you have to.  Plain and simple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaedhrosofnothing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maedhros of Nothing</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/051/45/30514540.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 6:42:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=619.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do so many ppl hate FF8?</span><hr size=1>   I liked FF 8, just not as much as the others. I liked the love theme, it was a nice change. The junction system was ok, not great not bad. The summoning was similar to 10, where you can have your monsters fight for you. But in 10 you can customize them alot more, teach them abilities, raise stats, plus you can win 99% of battles without summoning once. The pay by wage system was pretty cool too. The story line was somewhat absorbing...like how everyone would black out and then you'd have to play those 3 other guys(1st disc?), that sucked me right in. Otherwise, I think the draw system blew and I just couldn't quite get into the game. It felt like a chore to play it most of the time. I agree that everything in it looks pristine, almost to perfect. FFX was like this in a way but they sort of perfected it.<br>
  I believe 10 is the game 8 was meant to be. I haven't even beat it yet and Imo it eclipses 7 and friends. American FF2 is my all time fav and I'll always love 3 and 7 for nostalgia purposes. FFX is just a great game, I love it all. The sphere grid is an *awesome* way to customize chars and its not hard to pick up. The storyline is one of the best, mystery and Tidus narrates over half of it. <br>
 <br>
 ~Ok I have one quick question for all you guys who've beaten X already...its not much of a spoiler. Right now I'm running most of the side quests but I can't get back into the remiem temple. I first went there when I originally got to the Calm Lands. Now I can't find the chocobo lady to let me ride a chocobo so I can get back in. Without her I won't be able to get pieces for tidus's and yuna's legendary weapons + the Magus Sisters summon. If anyone knows what I'm talking about drop me a line here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ~   <br>

I /agree that Star Ocean: 2nd Story is @#%$ awesome, everyone should pick it up if bored. The Mario RPG series(and Paper Mario) are also excellent. I think people blew it off because Nintendo isn't really know for its Rpgs, Zelda's more action orientated. Hope they continue it on Game Cube. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is second to none if you feel like an old school side scroller, very well done.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaedhrosofnothing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maedhros of Nothing</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/051/45/30514540.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/30/02 6:44:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubarrinsoulburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Barrin Soulburner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>some newbie</span><br>  Posts: 777<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 6:49:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=619.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do so many ppl hate FF8?</span><hr size=1> 9 is really good, I like the story a lot, altho its a bit predictable, and Kuja isn't a very scary? villain.<br>

They are all good I think, better than 95% of other games like them on the market, I only posted this for the people like me that weren't playing 8.. cuz of what they heard about it.  I bet most of the people that always rag it, haven't played most.<br>
<br>
bottom line : don't be stupid like me ! its a love/hate kinda game I think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubarrinsoulburner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Barrin Soulburner</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>some newbie</span><br>  Posts: 778<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/30/02 6:58:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=619.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why do so many ppl hate FF8?</span><hr size=1> btw a tip for *anyone* that has any trouble playing FF8.<br>
<br>
This will make the game almost trivially easy until the final dungeons.<br>
<br>
The very first boss you fight, Draw Siren (GF).. you probably have already done this.  Go to GF menu.. make sure Siren is learning -- &quot; L Mag-RF &quot;  Refines life/recovery magic from items.<br>
<br>
Once you get this ability (only costs 30 ap - IE 1 boss or 20 min of fighting), you can refine 10 Curaga (most powerful cure spell) from 1 tent (1000gp).  Now provided you test up to ~ SeeD level 10 or so, within.. 1 hr of walking around leveling/drawing, you should have ~20,000 gp.  Buy 20 tents.  Turn 20 tents into 200 curaga.  Junction 100 curaga to hp on 2 chars.. when you get enough money, do it for your 3rd char.  This gives you +2500 hp or so.. provided you don't level your ass off, you should be able to breeze through the entire game w/o worrying much at all about leveling / drawing etc.<br>
<br>
For those that are frustrated ~~ or lazy.<br>
<br>
I replayed it and its much better the 2nd time, cuz you actually know how to use Junction and can enjoy the story a bit more.<br>
