The war between paladins and clerics rages on!   Take up arms, defeat the vile ressing paladins ... who ... omg ... might be useful to a group!  <br>
<br>
Clerics upset at these changes, are probably clerics who get upset at everything.    The changes affect NOTHING in the end game ... Paladins have the same endgame res, clerics have the same endgame res.<br>
<br>
Early on, Paladins can be uber helpful to thier group by ressing someone back.   Especially in dungeons.   You don't NEED a cleric at those low levels.   If you take a cleric with you, you'll have better resses and heals... its a choice.<br>
<br>
Maybe lowbie clerics wanna argue that fact.   But these changes also greatly helped clerics be &quot;needed&quot; in the 24-39 range, now with xp res... people might want them more than a druid or shaman.<br>
<br>
I hope, you guys are all very happy with your resses.   A well played Paladin is quite an addition to any group.<br>

I always love the &quot;I worked so hard&quot; argument.<br>
<br>
Levels = Spells.   All the spells we're talking about, for clerics and paladins, are store bought.   Essentially &quot;free&quot;.   You get the level, you get the spell.<br>
<br>
What work exactly did you do?<br>
<br>
Leveling is easy.   It can be more difficult, exciting, and fun, depending on where you go and what you are willing to try and do.   But its easy.<br>
<br>
Exceptional players will hit 60.<br>
Good players will hit 60.<br>
Average players will hit 60.<br>
Bad player arseholes will hit 60.<br>
<br>
Not always in that order either.<br>
<br>
Level 60 means you just played the game.   There are so many easy xp places around, its not funny.   There are also hard and challenging xp places.<br>

Seriously, the knowledgable and skilled Clerics realize that resurrection is more of a chore than a worthwhile &quot;skill&quot;.  A very wise Cleric once congratulated me when I hit L59 by telling me....<br>
<br>
&quot;The Resurrection Line is a set of spells that helps everyone but you&quot;<br>
<br>
While not entirely accurate the point is taken. ^_^ There is a reason why many Clerics go anon in certain zones.  It take time from them to go to the party that needs the Res or wait for them to deliver the corpse.  Time that coule be spent doing stuff for themselves instead of for others.  It may not be time wasted but sometimes it can be draining.<br>
<br>
In any event there is nothing wrong with spreading this around.  The Clerics in your guild need to reevaluate their value.  Do they really want to be known as the best res-ers or the best healers?  I think the answer is obvious. ^_^ <p><font size="+1">

If a cleric chooses to, he/she can make a lot of plat doing rezzes, and having another class to potentially compete with is one obvious reason clerics would be upset.<br>
<br>
Most clerics I've known get so much &quot;rez me 3 zones and a port away&quot; spam that they'd probably love to have other classes to take that burden so that they can actually focus on the group they're in rather than having to send &quot;sorry, I'm busy&quot; tells (or at least read the tell spam) in the middle of a tough pull.<br>
<br>
I don't think clerics will ever have problems finding groups relative to paladins, druids, or even shamans, so I really don't buy that argument.  Clerics will still always have a better rez than any paladin near their level, so even if they were competing for a group with a paladin, if the xp rez was really the deal breaker then the cleric would get the nod every time.<br>
<br>
Some people will complain whenever one of their class specific things is given to another class, even in a lesser form.  As an example, I'm sure there are paladins that would be upset if they gave SKs a half-hitpoint LoH capability.  That's probably the most legitimate argument of the bunch, or at least the one I can most relate to, but I still think this change is better for the game, and doesn't screw up class balance.<br>
<br>
I forsee the primary uses for the paladin rez to be 1) rezzing yourself if you die while soloing and a cleric isn't nearby, 2) rezzing others when no clerics are in the area so they either have to eat the death or take a paladin rez, or 3) rezzing a cleric in a raid wipeout where for some reason the clerics all died but a paladin survived.<br>

<br>
Besides, the Cleric resurrection is almost always more desirable than the Paladin level equivalent. It's the same with buffs and almost anything else that we get that can benefit others. The Cleric version will always be better, just because we get their early spells at a later level.<br>
<br>
As has been stated end game there’s really little difference so I don’t see it impacting the higher level game much (where resurrection really matters).<br>

The downside to not having a cleric in the group has always been not having anyone in the group to rez if things go bad. Thus forcing the group to look elsewhere for rezes and therefore more downtime. Considering that paladins can do a good job when it comes to rezing now, there is an alternative.<br>

If you take a Cleric in your exp group that means secondary healers are freed up to do damage or you can change the group composite to add more damage dealing.<br>

Another way to think about it is a Cleric has to learn the skill and timing necessary to heal properly and efficiently (and avoid nasty monster agro) but it is pretty brain dead to cast Resurrection.  ^_^<br>

I just wanted to add, that ressing is not a cash cow anymore.   Yes, definatly, some people will make money with it.   Sometimes when people are desperate they offer insane things for resses. <br>
<br>
However, a fortunate or unfortunate trend depending on your point of view, is that people simply don't pay often, or much, for resses anymore.   Regardless of cash, I've found an attitude of &quot;a res is a right, I died now res me&quot;.   Of course, definatly not everyone is like this, and I'm not saying it is.<br>
<br>
I just think &quot;the day&quot; of ressing being a cash cow are gone.   Perhaps if you went to rare and far away zones, hour after hour, and ressed... it might be worth it.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the worth... should clerics fear paladins getting a 75% res?   Lol, players on average are so anal about 90% res vs 96% res.   Clerics have nothing to fear, when they are around, they will be bugged for an hour extra, to save that 15-20 mins of fighting.<br>

Please keep it :)<br>
<br>
I have been swarmed with rez tells since level 49 since I refuse to go anon unless told.  When ever I am in any 40-50 zone I get harassed with tells.  I have been asked to rez in Dreadlands while in TOV.  I have been asked to rez in the hole while in Madiens Eye.  People are rude and harsh.  Most can not accept no for an answer.  Personally the more classes to rez the better off for me.<br>
<br>
So here is one happy cleric.  I just wish I had the early rez spells myself while I was leveling up.  Would have made things much easier on me. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=95523>Chaldaea "Imnotxakk" DeBebylon - Dragon Council</a>

I can't see it really hurting clerics, people will always prefer a cleric res of the equivalent level. (believe me I know, I have a 60 paladin and a 56 cleric, and I well know how many people are insistent on a 56 res.... :p)<br>
<br>
One thing I would like, which they talked about doing, is adding a line to the res box stating the percentage of exp returned via the res. I haven't had the pleasure of dying since the patch so I don't know if they did this, but I think it would be a nice change.  I think a lot of the folks who refuse 49 res on the off chance they can get a 56 res don't realize the relatively small difference between them.<br>
