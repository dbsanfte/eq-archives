Not about the posters, mind you, but about the effectiveness of my favorite (and main) class in EQ, especially when compared to other pure melee types (rogues and warriors).<br>
<br>
Boy, I'll bet this is unexpected.  Melee classes seem at a glance fairly well-balanced, at least against each other.  Warriors do melee damage and tanking -- getting opponents off of other people who deal more damage or otherwise get themselves hated.  Rogues do not take damage well, however deal damage exceptionally.  Under the right circumstances, rogues can outdamage any other fighting class.  Monks in theory land somewhere in the middle, with better damage than warriors, better tanking than rogues, as well as some other abilities and drawbacks that spice up the package a bit.<br>
<br>
So, what is the deal?  Well, it ends up that many of the best weapons introduced in Kunark are usable by either monks or warriors (think Jade Mace).  The weapons are heavy enough that monks will typically have to sacrifice AC to wield them (not a problem for warriors).  Furthermore, high warrior skill caps in 1HB, DA, and DW, combined with higher strength on warriors, makes a warrior arguably as good as a monk in the damage-dealing arena.<br>
<br>
Okay, monks can pull though, right?  Well, this is another point where there's some uncertainty about the monk class.  Verant's spokesman, Abashi, has stated on at least a few occasions that the use of FD skill to pull was not intended, and has furthermore implied that this was a tactic Verant was actively working to squelch.  Changes to this ability in the past by Verant (actually, mainly aimed at necromancers using an overly effective tactic against Nagafen) have already done a good job of pooching us.  The newest dungeon, The Hole, has changes to creature behavior that makes feign pulling impossible by most accounts.<br>
<br>
No conclusion to be drawn here, just general dread that my main character will not be pulling his weight in a fight.<br>
<br>
So, what do people think about this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/usanosuske.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanosuske</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/13/00 12:14:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   No class envy here yet, but depends on abashi</span><hr size=1> Let me start out by saying I love being a monk.

Note: I dont say tanking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  My only concern for the class is Abashi's disappoval of Fiegn pulling. If i had not had more pressing matters at hand i wouldve been at this EQ gathering to ask him in person what he has against monks being needed for a party/raid to be most effective. Would he do this to other classes? Imagine that he gets tired of Enchanters been needed and nerfs clarity, no, no, that would NEVER happen. Bah i need to stop writing soon before this Abashi thing angers me. I just cant understand how he can justify the whole rediculous &quot;necro res&quot; spell and then turn around and take FD pulling from monks.<br>

<br>
Remember that flying kick constitutes ~20% of the monks overall damage.  Even if warriors have comprable weapons, monks are adding kicks going as high as the 120s.  At 55, I kick for 90+ often, self-buffed.  Warrior's normal kicks can't even begin to compare to this kind of damage output.<br>
<br>
In terms of weapons, monk weapons are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> vastly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> superior to warrior weapons.  If you need evidence of this, look to 2h.  The best, non-hasted ratio for a warrior is 31/37 (/smile Nillon).  Monks have 3 choices (19/20, 29/30, 28/30) that don't even come off gods that are clearly superior to the 31/37.  Hell, one of the best 2hb's out there for non-monks is the rod of mourning, which was nerfed, only a 29/36 (the rod of lamentation, its replacement, is only 25/36, from what I remember).<br>
<br>
At level 60 however, triple attack does add a significant boost to warrior damage output.  However, depending on how often it kicks in , it may be just a small boost to damage.  Damage testing will need to be held between lvl 60 warriors and monks to see how significant triple attack works.<br>
<br>
Concerning rogues, we deal alot more damage when the rogue cannot bs.  However, rogues do put out more damage (double bs for 500 anyone?) when they can take advantage of their class defining skill.  I feel that this is perfectly fine, /shrug.<br>
<br>
Concerning fd pulling, I have advocated in the past about its infinite uses and its necessity to groups.  However, I find myself rarely using it at all, instead relying on level knowledge, experience, and trick of the trade.  Very simply put, when I say &quot;anyone can pull this @#%$&quot;, I am being very literal.<br>
<br>
This is the case in large groups (which I spent the majority of my time now), where I just bring in the meat and the chanters take it from there.  I pull because I know what I'm doing, fd if anything unexpected happens, and split if the chanters need a mana break, in that order.<br>
<br>
However, in small 6 person groups, I do use fd pulling to some degree, opting for varients on it, such as chaining or spell-spliting (running mobs out of agro cause they stop to cast spells).  However, I fd pull (in its purest form) as little as I can, because while your in Sebilis or Chardok (I personally avoid Karnor like the plague), the backspawn does NOT give you the luxury of time needed to properly execute a fd split.<br>
<br>
In the end however, I don't feel that FD pulling needs any sort of nerfing or change.  The FD patch made it safer for monks to pull and in its current state, is fine.  I find that FD pulling is best described as crowd control, just like a enchanter mez's, bards charm, or druids/shamans root.  These are all methods that people use to control groups of mobs.  In the case of root and Feign Death, people learned how to adapt these skills to other purposes. <p><font face="Arial" size="1"><a href="http://sr.amiga.tm/cgi-bin/members.cgi?show=Kambing">Kambing "Goat" Ebonhoof</a><br>

The best non-hasted two-hander for a warrior of Nillon's level is a Mosscovered Branch, though, not the Staff of Battle.<br>
<br>
However, none of this really contradicts your point that monks get the best weapons since there are quite a few monk weapons that beat the Branch.  Even SKs and Rangers have a better two-hander ( Blood Runed Two Hander and Woodsman's Staff, respectively). <p><font color=8bb4d2 face="Garamond"><b>- Cope -</b></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/18/00 3:00:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/itsme.jpg height=188 width=115></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class envy... from a monk?</span><hr size=1> how so, copeland?

If you completely discount the proc on the RoM then, yes, SoB (nice initials!) is slightly better.  If you do count the proc, then I think the RoM is slightly better.  <br>
<br>
However, the differences either way are so slight as to be irrelevant, so there's nothing wrong with the choice you made.<br>
<br>
Criticals are largely a non-issue.  The SoB has slightly bigger criticals slightly less often; the RoM has slightly smaller criticals slightly more often.  However, some of the folks at Paladins and Stratics have parsed several hours of continous fighting and the extra damage due to criticals is not particularly significant.  Given that, I doubt that bigger/less often vs. smaller/more often debate is going to make or break one weapon or the other.<br>
<br>
You are correct, however, that the SoB would be better if you had Furious running, since the riposte damage would be a bit higher and delay does not factor into that.  To balance that, the RoM would probably taunt slightly better since faster weapons have a decided advantage in that area.<br>
<br>
Here's some math.  I'll assume you are 55th and have around 150 STR.  If your STR is different, it's not that big a factor since it takes a lot of STR to move the average damage curve.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   SoB</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Min = 1<br>
Magic = 62<br>
~Max = (225 + 150)/100 * 31 = 116<br>
<br>
Adding in the level bonus and using the 45/50/5 rule that generally applies to fighting blues:<br>
<br>
Average Damage = 15 + (.45 * 1) + (.50 * 62) + (.05 * 116) = 52.25<br>
<br>
Average Damage Per Minute = 52.25 * 600 / 37 = 847<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   RoM</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Min = 1<br>
Magic = 58<br>
~Max = (225 + 150)/100 * 29 = 109<br>
<br>
Average Damage without proc = 15 + (.45 * 1) + (.50 * 58)   + (.05 * 109) = 49.9<br>
<br>
Average DPM without proc = 49.9 * 600 / 36 = 832<br>
<br>
Now, consider 3% proc rate and 40% resist rate.  If you think MOBs resist less often, the RoM will get better; if you think they resist more often, it will get worse.<br>
<br>
Proc damage per round = .03 * (1 - .4) * 90 = 1.6<br>
<br>
Average Damage with proc = 49.9 + 1.6 = 51.5<br>
<br>
Average DPM with proc = 51.5 * 600 / 36 = 858<br>
<br>
As for the comments of the warriors on other servers...well, two things.  <br>
<br>
First, they may know something I don't know--that is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   entirely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> possible.  My conclusions are &quot;paper conclusions.&quot;  I'm always willing to learn more about how the game works.  So, if there's something I'm missing, I would really like to hear it.<br>
<br>
Second, they may be wrong.  There is an astonishing amount of EverMyth in this game that no one questions...usually based upon something like &quot;well, it seems to me that....&quot; or &quot;I have this gut feeling that...&quot;  Look at how many folks swore that two-handers like Skarlons were superior to dual wielded weapons before the two-hander patch.  <br>
<br>
So, the approach I take is to assume I may not be right, but also to assume that the other guy may not be either until I see some testing data.  If you have some information that would indicate the math above is wrong or fails to consider some aspect, I really want to know. <p><font color=8bb4d2 face="Garamond"><b>- Cope -</b></font></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=copeland>Copeland</A> at: 7/18/00 5:59:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udyninvifargent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dynin Vifargent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/19/00 11:08:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class envy... from a monk?</span><hr size=1> goat : FD pulling is definitely over rated<br>

i havent seen trak's lair but i'm sure it will be doable without a monk ( not now of course since we're kinda far from being all 60 ) as well even if it will take a while to figure out how ( vox and nag's lairs with the dragon up are doable with a warrior without dieing most of the time )<br>
i dont think it's really impossible without a FDer since verant is still ( yeah yeah i know they keep saying that.. ) planning to get rid of FD pulling<br>

Everything is doable really.  But I would say.. highly highly unadvisable at this time with our current knowledge base.  Most likely.. once everyone and their 4th twink has cleared Trak's lair and Trak as well.. it will still be deemed highly highly unadvisable.  Using a eye of zomme is doable.. just not the best idea.<br>
<br>
Now that I said that... I feel Kambing and Kaladiel are gonna push me into trak's lair next time and watch me suffer numerous, ugly,  hard to look at type deaths at the hands of Trak's minions.  Just one of the reasons I have no prolblem with the professionals pulling for SR... so I can watch them suffer numerous, ugly, funny to look at deaths at the hands of Trak's minions.<br>

just because sumtimes me pull mur den une well dat what a chanter is for )<br>
<br>
but here a question anyone notice how our tuant skill does not effect the 55 plus mods<br>
or damage/spell taunts work fine but i noticed that our taunt skill is worthles<br>
like for example pulling shrooms in sel, well chanter mezes 1 you bash one<br>
you taunt and taunt and taunt but it still goes were ever<br>
it only locks on you near the end<br>
and taunt a mezed mob furget it<br>
no matter how many times you taunt before ye break mez it seems to still go after enchanter<br>
jugs and shrooms do this alot<br>
