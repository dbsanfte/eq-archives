He sighted in the blue skinned demon. The arrow, would strike between the eye's. God's how he hated every last one of them. He let fly the arrow. The twang of his bow, almost musical. The arrow struck with such velocity and force, that the small orc was flung back a full ten paces. Kythan smiled. Another small piece of this cancer removed forever from the Faydark.<br>
<br>
He quickly slung his bow over his shoulder, and unsheathed his fine elvan blade. The rustling of the leaves could be heard all around him as he quickly moved in to inspect his victim. A storm was comming. A furious one. The heavy air weighed him down, and he could feel a chill creap into his bone's. <br>
<br>
Crouching over the smelly, diminuative orc, Kythan lopped off it's head with one quick motion. The arrow, still protruding from the middle of it's head, bounced around in an awkward manner. He graabed the head by a small tuft of hair at the back of it's neck, and quickly went about setting up his calling card.<br>
<br>
He summond his steed, the midnight black mount he named Nightrunner. He stroked the star shaped white marking on the horses muzzle. Reaching around to the back of the horse, he removed a four foot pole from the horses pack. He drove the pole into the ground, and proceeded to mount the orc's head pon the pole. It's pink and black tounge, peeking out through it's blood spattered lip's.<br>
<br>
He strode back to the body, and removed a curious looking parcel from it's makeshift pouch. It had been written in a tounge unknown to Kythan, and the pen manship came from a lithe, steady hand. Surely it had not been scribed by the twitching, heavy hand of an orc. He wondered, who could have wrote it. Surely a matter for the Emerald Warrior's to look into.<br>
<br>
Kythan surveyed the wood around him. No orc, had been seen this close to Kelethin in a score and one half year. He wondered, why an orc courier, would be passing this route. This road lead deeper into the Faydark, toward the area that had come to be known as Lesser Faydark. A haven for darkness and evil.<br>
<br>
He lept upon Nightrunner and set about unstringing his bow. He stopped midway through the process, something stired behind him. The faint sound of breathing could barely be heard over the creaking tree branches and rustling leaves of the mid season storm. His elvish ears perked up to catch the sound again. Some one, was behind him, watching him. <br>
<br>
He thought for what seemed like an eternity. No orc could be deft enough to catch him off guard, What could it be! He knocked and arrow, fast as lightning, and rolled off of night runner's back, firing a shot in midfall. The shaft stuck in a tree next to where he thought the sound eminated from. He saw a dark form dart into the wood. It was thin and graceful, it's movement's like a practiced dance as it darted through the wood. <br>
<br>
He knocked another arrow, and gave chase. He gained ground quickly on the figure. He saw the shadow leap into the air, and land upon a fallen tree that hung over a small brook. Kythan stopped quickly and drew a bead upon the shadow. It's eye's shown a briliant shimmering blue. It captivated him for a moment, giving the creature just enough time to bound it's way across the makeshift bridge. The bow string sang for the third time that night, and Kythan heard the thud of the arrow striking another tree. Another arrow he drew from the quiver, and set across the brook. <br>
<br>
A glint of steel caught his eye, as a multi bladed dagger flew from the shadow's hand. He dove to the ground, as the dagger flew over head. He came up into a roll, and dropped his bow to the ground, freeing his steel from it's sheath. He could tell the creature was through running, at least for the moment. &quot;Who are you?&quot; Kythan demanded.<br>
<br>
The lithe figure drew forth two short sword's. Thier handles made of the finest ivory. The hilt's fasioned into the shape of two serpent's fighting, one serpent, swallowing the tail of the other. As his eye's focused, Kythan could see the outline of two pointed ear's, and the shapely figure of a woman.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Owl-Lynn, I am the last face you will ever see.&quot;<br>
