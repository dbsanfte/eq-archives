<br>
Also... the guy above him, you mentioned us getting better results by suggesting things?  the only time a mage has ever gotten any response is when they made a comparison and a very valid balance issue, because gaining 9 AA exp points is so much incredibly easier then getting the mage epic that the epic pet should out perform it, especially because the mages are supposedly the master of pets... if it was the other way around and chanter epic gave them dire charm, and mages had to gain 9 aa exp points to get their pet that is the epic pet now, then it would still be unbalancing, but not as much, because mages should be better with pets then a chanter...<br>
<br>
Time spent on epic... ok so one of your guild members spent a month and a half and finished his epic, another one spent 2 months... and you can honestly think this is the norm for mages?<br>
<br>
My personal experience with the epic...<br>
I started my epic about the middle of the summer, and I got to a point, which I am still at now (need air crown, hate staff, and com torch) about maybe 2 months ago<br>
<br>
that first period of time was nothing but epic stuff and raiding, and I play a fairly decent amount... not a ton, but still...<br>
<br>
anyways thats 5+ months or so, working on the epic... I donno exactly how much time, and I didn't have to do quilmane because a friend got me that piece... thank god...<br>
<br>
your 2 month estimate for the mage epic is extremely faulty, and has no truth in it at all... you can not find an estimate by looking at 2 mages you know... a much better estimate would be found by speaking with mages accross the servers... which I have done...<br>
<br>
The point is only that the mage epic is nothing to sit back and say its easy, it can be optained at level 50, and you can buy it all... we dont say that about yours because we dont know first hand, and we'd appreciate if you would extend that same curtousy...<br>
<br>
Time spent on mage epic is MUCH  >  Time spent on 9 aa exp points (even 27 if you want to claim those other points did you no good and you were never going to get them anyways)<br>
<br>
Dire charm MUCH > mage epic<br>
<br>
Mages are supposedly the master of pets...<br>
<br>
those 3 points mean there is a problem with the skill and how it is balanced against mage pets... honestly all most of the mages want is an aa ability that makes our pets this good, or maybe slightly better for 5-10 mins, not permanent, but enough to be of use on uber mobs... of the remaining ones most of them want better pets accross the board, then you find a couple mages that are bitter and want dire charm nerfed in some sick way of "getting back" at the chanters for the fact that they feel they have been "nerfed worse" <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caraddor>Caraddor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/8/02 4:50:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <b><i> Caraddor my point was not that you dont have a clue about mages, but you are in no position to tell us if our epic is easy, or if its hard, how hard it is etc. until you have done it you have no place to tell us about it... we dont try to tell you...</b></i><br>
<br>
Again.. I never said it was easy.  I expressed doubt it took over a year to do.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Time spent on epic... ok so one of your guild members spent a month and a half and finished his epic, another one spent 2 months... and you can honestly think this is the norm for mages?</b></i><br>
<br>
Stop taking things out of the context of the thread please.  Order of events so far:<br>
 - a mage says it takes over a year for folks to do mage epic<br>
 - I said I doubt it<br>
 - another mage says average time is 6 months<br>
 - I point out that 6 months < 1 year<br>
 - a mage suggests I ask some mages on my server<br>
 - I poll two lvl 60 epic mages in my guild, as requested<br>
 - No one likes the answer, so they say I'm full of @#%$<br>
<br>
I never said two months was the average for any mage to do the epic.  <b>I only said I doubted it took over a year</b>.  That was backed up by another <b>mage</b> that said average time was 6 months.<br>
<br>
<b><i>your 2 month estimate for the mage epic is extremely faulty, and has no truth in it at all... you can not find an estimate by looking at 2 mages you know... a much better estimate would be found by speaking with mages accross the servers... which I have done...</b></i><br>
<br>
Read my response above.. <br>
<br>
<b><i>The point is only that the mage epic is nothing to sit back and say its easy, it can be optained at level 50, and you can buy it all... we dont say that about yours because we dont know first hand, and we'd appreciate if you would extend that same curtousy...</b></i><br>
<br>
It cannot be completely bought, although many pieces can be multiquested.  I would say that makes it similar to yours in that respect (assuming you can't just buy the complete mage epic and you <i>have</i> to do some of it).<br>
<br>
<b><i>Time spent on mage epic is MUCH > Time spent on 9 aa exp points (even 27 if you want to claim those other points did you no good and you were never going to get them anyways)</b></i><br>
<br>
Granted.. although you really should count those points.  It doesn't matter to the game if you want to use the other abilities, but you <b>must</b> spend those points.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Dire charm MUCH > mage epic</b></i><br>
<br>
Debatable.  Scroll back through the thread and you'll find some good points listing pros/cons of a mage summoned pet versus a dire charmed pet.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Mages are supposedly the master of pets...</b></i><br>
<br>
Yes, mages are the master of pets.  Even with dire charm in the game.<br>
<br>
<b><i>those 3 points mean there is a problem with the skill and how it is balanced against mage pets... honestly all most of the mages want is an aa ability that makes our pets this good, or maybe slightly better for 5-10 mins, not permanent, but enough to be of use on uber mobs...</b></i><br>
<br>
Could you list these uber fights for me?  Where dire charm is so useful?  My guild is not uber.  When pets are allowed in a boss mob fight though, they are generally summoned just before the fight (pathing problems are a pain, no argument from me there).  We don't send enchanters/necros/druids running through the zone to find a suitable candidate for dire charm.  Are uber guilds doing that?  I'm thinking Dire Charm is mostly a toy.  Usable for solo or xp groups, not raiding uber mobs.<br>
<br>
<b><i> of the remaining ones most of them want better pets accross the board,</b></i><br>
<br>
I think mage pets are around the power point they should be.  The mage epic pet is <b>not</b> an underpowered useless pet.  I've seen it in action.<br>
<br>
<b><i> then you find a couple mages that are bitter and want dire charm nerfed in some sick way of "getting back" at the chanters for the fact that they feel they have been "nerfed worse"</b></i><br>
<br>
Those are the folks that should be drug out in the street and beaten.  No one ever needs to scream for a nerf.  I honestly can't understand why they do.  They don't like being nerfed themselves, so why wish it on others? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52096">Caraddor</a> (Order of the Scattered Winds)<br>

Time spent working on the epic was around 45 days - 2 months. We'll say 3 months for good measure. Still nowhere close to a year. "<br>
<br>
Ok so 3 months... you took 2 characters and found an estimate of 3 months from them... first thats pretty quick... I've been working on mine much longer then that and am still 3 pieces away....<br>
<br>
even if it was 3 months thats much more effort then dire charm (if you want to say 27 points fine, my point still remains, even tho those points do help you, and anyone getting dire charm would have gotten em anyways...  I guess that would be similiar to a mage counting the time that it took him guilded for his guild to deem him worthy of support for his epic, both times would have been done anyways, and both benefit you in other ways)<br>
<br>
My point is that I dont understand who some of the druids think they are by telling us the mage epic is easy, can be bought and can be gotten at level 50...<br>
<br>
Ok its true you CAN theoretically buy many pieces of the epic... but lets dispell the rumor that this is easy... and if it was it'd prolly take you more time to raise the cash then to get the items<br>
20k peg cloak<br>
250k eart staff<br>
30k water staff<br>
100k air crown<br>
<br>
that right there is 400k, which is gonna take a LONG time... and thats not counting all the rest of it... nobody is gonna farm half of the drops from greenies that you need just to sell em, simply caus nobody is gonna pay for em, they'd rather camp a boring green camp for 5+ hours<br>
<br>
Anyways the point mages have is that our pets are pretty much ok in exp groups... which is mostly where dire charm would take over and completely keep us from finding some groups at times...<br>
<br>
However, our pets are not even summoned on most high end areas (I am always allowed to summon mine but I hear my guild is rare about this... well not in ToV or some areas of hate but thats it)<br>
<br>
We want a way to make our pets useful... I think its an even tradeoff that a chanter can charm a pet forever that is way better then the mage epic, in pretty much every exp zone, and a few raid zones, if then the mages can have that same pet for the 5-10 mins it takes to take down your typical uber mob... (I dont mean Endgame NToV necisarily... more speaking of your more typical stuff at the bottom of that category, vindi, doze, zland maybe, etc.)<br>
<br>
Anyways gonna finally let this die, I think you all know my opinion on the matter, caus I've posted way too much on this thread on your board... my simple request is that if you want to tell a mage his epic is easy, or can be bought, how bout you try it some time, or at least ask around enough to find a decent estimate of time/effort spent... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeyotie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peyotie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/11/02 3:29:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Isnt there some mage AA or spell that grants their pet like 200% haste or some insane amount??<br>

The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (One day in game time.).<br>
<br>
First glance that looks pretty good right?  well the pet is *supposed* to blow up at the end doing 1k damage AE... which would be pretty kewl... but as is the pet poofs... so you get a pet with 99% haste (as opposed to 65% which is our best spell, plus 25% from muzzle of mardu), with increased str, AC, and armor class... for 36 seconds... then poof you have to resummon your pet, reequip it with armor if you gave it that, muzzle if you did, and rebuff with burnout, and maybe DS...<br>
<br>
<br>
Tests showed it doing less then 1k damage more in the 36 seconds then not using it... so thats in the 36 seconds you have it, then you lose a bunch of time resummoning/requuiping, not to mention mana, so your 900 or so hps extra that you dealt, is cut down, not exactly sure how far, depends how well you equip your pet... but it is cut down a LOT...<br>
<br>
So for the same price as dire charm we get to do, at most 400-500 damage more then normal, and spend an extra 550-800 mana (400 for pet, 150 for burnout, 155 for muzzle, 155 for DS)<br>
<br>
ya thats some insane 200% haste isn't it? :)<br>
<br>
btw sorry I just HAD to add that in, caus I really hate misinformation<br>
