I have yet to go to this zone, mostly because My understanding is a group is required.  However, after perusing some sights it appears this may not be the case and a small group pulling carefully could do rather well here.<br>
<br>
Me - 55 paladin, partner 55 Shaman<br>
Occasional add'l groupmembers - 50 bard, 49 ranger, 55 mage<br>
<br>
Would the two of us, 55 shaman and 55 paladin be able to kill these even remotely effectively in the zone?   Would we be essentially killed on site by the mobs?   What part of the zone and what mobs might we be able to kill?<br>
<br>
Just looking for some new places to go that will have a chance to drop some items that are upgrades to my existing.<br>

<br>
I duo'ed with a 53 Mage using Monster Summoning 2. <br>
<br>
Tactics: <br>
<br>
I pull a MoB that is blue to yellow to me with stun. If it sticks, stun again. Keep stunning till it is almost to me, using DW bracer. Retreat to camp. Mage sics pet, with /pet taunt off. I run around trying to avoid being hit by the ridiculously overaggroed goranga/toiler/whatever. When the MoB turns on the pet, use Holy Might (6 second or slightly longer 59 DD stun) to stop it, and immediately hit DW bracer (which has been hotkeyed since level 45 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) again, since Holy Might lasts just a LITTLE bit longer than the cast time on DW bracer. Keep this up. If pet gets aggro too much, root and start mashing the DW bracer key. By the time Root breaks, you will have gotten a LOT of aggro (perhaps a dead pet as well, but so what? If the Mage knows how to chain pets, all is well, and the Mage can really just sit down where you are aggro kiting the MoB.<br>
<br>
This should also work with a Warrior (MUST have JBoots! The MoBs run pretty fast) who is using a 2hander (not 1handers, or he'll get aggro too quickly) or a Ranger with a 2hander (don't let him use Swarmcaller though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), or Rogue, ETC. (pretty much any melee class, as long as a Paladin or SK is the bait for the MoB).<br>
<br>
<br>
After kite is over and MoB is dead, heal up with your DW helm (convince your group that nothing better is needed hehe, because if you're aggro kiting I found you can get away without buffs at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and med up to 1 and 1/2 bubs of mana (all I ever needed once I got the &quot;feel&quot; of it) and pull again.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some tips for getting aggro aside from stunning: <br>
<br>
Sit. OR:<br>
Take off all your armor.<br>
<br>
Sitting makes the MoB aggro towards you as if you were a level 1 player. Taking off your armor works because of one of the slightly-less-recent patches which made MoBs tend more to aggro on those with lower AC.<br>
<br>
<br>

Pathing is kind of strange on some of the mobs.  For instance, my first time there, I stunned a goranga something or another, and then he ran around half the zone to get his buddies.  Fortunately, he only brought two friends, which we root-parked.  Get used to frequent double-taps in the mid 100's.  Maiden Eye MOBs can dish out some damage.<br>
<br>
My advice would be to set up camp on the hills near the zone and pull the solo MOBs that wander around.  You could also set up camp near the Ahkeva zone and whack the aliens that pop nearby.  If you slow them, they'd be easy to do.  They're soloable in the high 50's, but it's still a bit of a fight.  I haven't spent any time killing the coterie guys, so I can't help you there. <p>That which does not kill you will probably make you wish that it had.<BR>

Any idea the Hit points these guys have?  <br>
<br>
Right now, we have been hunting in Skyfire a bit, and chardok when we can get the enterance.    Essentially, with slow on the mobs, they are doing 80's to 100's on me, but not very often, and it is pretty easy to keep up healing with the damage.  <br>
<br>
It sounds like the biggest issue will be getting them solo, and then just taking them out.   Also, from research I have done, most mobs in the zone seem to be very susceptable to Spells, in this case, Slow would be huge, along with plague to wittle them down while the pet and I take them out.<br>
<br>
What type of Hit points do these mobs have?   Are they similar to Mature wurms wyverns and lava walkers in Skyfire?  running about 10kish?<br>
<br>
thanks for the help thus far, might just have to give it a whirl.  Heck, with 75% rez available, I am a bit less cautious these days...<br>

Can you duo there at 55? Yup. Will it be productive? Nope.<br>
<br>
While waiting on some friends the other night, I decided to see if I could solo a Goranga Follower (I THINK it was a follower - I get them confused) at 55. My conclusion? I could probably do it, but the time it would take to do it is more than the regularly scheduled trains to the DS zone line. After 10 minutes or so, I had him to 50 percent or so, and things felt pretty under control. Then a train hit and I had to zone. But that would allow me to kill a blue every 20 minutes or so, even in the absence of trains. Blech.<br>
<br>
I've duo'd there with a 55 druid. Same deal, just marginally better. You can kill gorangas, but it will take you a great deal of time and resources, so much so that the experience is glacial. And to add to your fun you'll likely get trained on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
I got my Goranga Spiked Club this way. So if you have some specific goal, it might be worth trying. But it is a lousy way to get exp.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps...<br>

Tremendous help guys.   <br>
<br>
I guess I will take on Maiden's once I get my main hunting partners up a couple levels so the ranger is 50+, the bard is 51+...and the mage can come along.    Using that, we should be able to do groups there.<br>
<br>
As for specific goals?  I was just looking for something different, a bit of challenge, but still a lot of fun.   Seemed like a good place to go.....<br>
<br>
However, until I get my friends up a touch, I think I will take up to The Grey and see if anything good drops while having fun with the Shissar..<br>

If you do aggro kiting, do not let the Mage use an earth or air pet. Or a Fire pet for that matter. Earth will root, temporarily ending the kite, air will stun, getting aggro too fast, fire will get hurt too fast if the MoB turns on it... and at some point the MoB *will* turn on the pet. <p><font><font size=3><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45984>Balidin</a>,</font> The Evilbasher</b><BR><font color=red><i>Paladin of the 4900th LFG</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usularusglorybringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sularus Glorybringer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.superior.net/~markf/babypics/sos/us.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/02 12:47:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/1eb06dad/bc/Mail+Attachments/__tn_Vera3.jpg?bc8.j88An419KdN8 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maiden's Eye - Duoing</span><hr size=1> I've been duo'ing here with a mage easily, even at 51.<br>

<br>
Really depends on what you're after.  For xps, go the group route.  Too much downtime Duoing.  HP on MOBs are about 8-10k on toilers to 15K+ on Centiens. (Which require at least 4-5 people if you're sub 55.)<br>
<br>
If you're looking for Loot Douing can be effective, but is still slow.  I've gotten Strength of Grodan, Mage earing, Mage neck, The +4 all stats booties, and lots of Goranga idols in this zone by duo'ing.<br>
<br>
Single Pulling MOBs isn't bad just watch where you are pulling from and learn the wandering paths of MOBs.<br>
<br>
Just don't set up by a zoneline because trains are VERY common and usually unnounced.<br>
<br>
Only MOB I've had see invis is the Vampire Bats but the cotarie do invis themselves.<br>

there's a LOT of ubead mob in this area, pull bats (undead) or skellys.<br>

It's a fun weapon to play around with. 12/23 5ac 2 str and really really common. <br>
<br>
The shaman's slow will help immensely. The goranga gatherers are pretty easy to single pull at the zoneline, tho be prepared for train city. ME is awful for that. <br>
<br>
 I think it depends on your ac and weapon a bit tho. How much damage are you willing to take? They can hit easily in the 130s, 140s. And they have alot of hp. 10k is probably right. It's not bad xp, but not the greatest. <br>
If you throw in another 55+ anyclass into your group you'll have no troubles there. <br>

Once the Shaman slow sticks, you'll have no problem tanking the Gorangas. They have a lot of HP for their XP, but they don't hit very hard. If I remember, they hit for a median of around 60ish, lows of around 30 and highs around 120.<br>

Whenever I got bored, I solo the Gorangas, but the downtime is long if I don't have KEI or C2<br>

Notes:<br>
* Coteries are bad - that lifetap sux<br>
* Bats suck - they hit hard and have way too much hp for their own good<br>
* Wolves suck - they hit too hard and have too much hp<br>

Well, we tried this out, just to see how well it worked.<br>
<br>
55 pal, 55 shm (with epic, JBB)<br>
<br>
We spent about 3 hours there, just killing High on the wall near the zoneline, testing out Goranga's.<br>
<br>
Pretty much as all of you mentioned.   The goranga lookouts &amp; gatherer's we can kill one, pull next, repeat indefinately so long as they all come solo.   <br>
<br>
We pulled a hunter, those cause some downtime.   We killed him, didn't need LH or anything, but by the end, we were both OOM, from heals, DoT's, DD, and everything else.<br>
<br>
So, doable on them, but just not worth the effort.  I think if we added 1-3 others, we could start killing fast enough that it would be worth it from a possible loot standpoint, and maybe from an XP standpoint.<br>
<br>
just thought I would let everyone know how it went.<br>

But, I've used this same duo in the Grey very successfull.  The mobs in the Grey don't seem to have as many hitpoints as the ones in ME.  The shaman and I are both 56 now, and we made 2 blue in a couple of hours.  Yeah, it's slow, but you don't have quite the same pathing problems as in ME and the mobs are more manageable ... even the Rockfiends. If your other friends join you, than either zone would be good. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=69612">Baron Taallyn Nifesblade</a><BR>

<br>
Best advice I can give is this, try it BUT stay way from the zone lines if you can, far too many trains and they will eventually get you killed. If you an kill at a descent pace ( you hitting it and your shammy partner DoTing it, and using a pet, I see no prblems ) stick with it, it is a nice place with potential for a bit of loot, and the XP isnt bad if you get into a good pace.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts about ME duoing, for the record Ive duoed it with a monk, and also with a shammy, worked out well. <p>Thorgrym Bladedancer

Fighting near the zone, decided to try our luck on a Goranga Shaman. Wasn't too bad, had two paladins and a cleric in group, so we were interrupting almost every spell. He had more hitpoints then I would have thought. Anyway, after we kill him, I con the corpse and it says &quot;29 minutes 30 seconds until corpse decays&quot;. So of course I'm thinking it's got some nice loot on it, and of course I'm wrong. Words of something and that's it. What's the deal with that? I don't think any of the other gorangas had a 30 minute timer. <p><CENTER><FONT COLOR="847bff"><B>Falloraan Trueblade<BR>52nd Season Half-Elf Cavalier<BR>Thunder Struck - Tholuxe Paells</FONT></B><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38753" target="_Blank">Profile</A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwyrmbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wyrmbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 148<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/20/02 10:27:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=43.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0nwy3/everquest/wyrmbane_sml.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maiden's Eye - Duoing</span><hr size=1> <br>
Nothing on Mob = 30 seconds<br>
<br>
Coin only on mob = 7 minutes<br>
<br>
Any item other than coin from Grodan's flowing cape to fishing grubs = 30 minutes<br>

<br>
If you want to verify this con Phinny's corpse, he's got some epic drop loot almost every time but since he's level 53 he's got the short timer.  We had him poof one time when people assumed we had 30 mins and we didn't loot fast enough. <p><BR>
