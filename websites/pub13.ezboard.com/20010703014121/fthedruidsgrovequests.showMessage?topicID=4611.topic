(epic)</span><hr size=1> Ok, here's how I understand it. :)<br>
<br>
You can solo all of these critters at 50 <br>
<br>
Corrupted Mammoth<br>
Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman<br>
Corrupted Hill Giant<br>
Corrupted Gorilla<br>
Corrupted Barracuda<br>
<br>
You need groups and a couple of hours (if your lucky) to kill these things.<br>
<br>
Corrupted Seahorse<br>
Corrupted Cyclops<br>
Ulump Pujik<br>
<br>
Now the part that is a tad ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Venril Sather Remains - you have to camp this guy for 24 hours?  and on the off chance he pops at ANY DIFFERENT time you have to just have 12 54+ chars sitting around that you know really well to get there in a maximum of 2 hours?<br>
(plus does anything aggro on you sitting in this room? can you just hang out there till he pops?)<br>
<br>
Faydedar - Need to have a Naggy sized raid assembled.  Which should'nt be too hard with a pick-up raid.  4 hour timer on the Dwarf guy?   So this isn't that hard then?<br>
<br>
Black Reaver - What is this about... this seems to be the most insane part of the quest.  Uber mob, rare drop... what is that about?  Plus I have to have access to a 51+ rouge to JUST get to these guys.  So if anyone happens to have a Jade Reaver for sale on Xegony send me a /tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
And lastly the raid group to drop the reaver in less than 5 minutes.  Only 1 group is needed?<br>
<br>
What is wrong in my thinking?  How does a druid that works ever hope to camp for 24 hours straight?  I'm not in a uber guild, so I guess it's no epic for me :(  If anyone can help it would be MUCH appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys (the ever frustrated epic druid)<br>

(epic)</span><hr size=1> First off Faydedar is very easy since he is triggerable so that should be cake.<br>
<br>
Getting the jade reaver is kinda of a pain but considering the Shaman as well as the Enchanters have to go the same route for their epic NPC's it not all that hard.<br>
<br>
And as for VSR....Venril Sathir's Clone he has a 24hr + or - 2hr spawn time after the death of the real VS so you don't sit there for 24hrs just come back about 20hrs after they kill VS or the previous VSR. Also VSR can be killed by one group of lvl55+ folks.<br>
<br>
I have heard rumors that VSR has spawned as early as 2 hrs after VS's demise but that last 3 times my guild has killed him he did pop within that time frame I gave.<br>

(epic)</span><hr size=1> Ok, here's what I have found on Mithaniel Marr; <br>
Ulump - almost always up<br>
Seafurry - Always (and I mean ALWAYS) up<br>
VS2 - ok, takes 2 groups (can be taken with a well balanced party of 57+)  you cannot just sit in the room because there are not only spawns through that path that you need to take to get there but also I think there are 3 to 4 inside the room.  If you really want to put a characture in there get a necro to level 22 (I think) or a monk to 19 and FD in room.  Also if you can't get two groups then talk to a druid that doesn't have the leaf blower or a ranger without two lightning swords in a guild that can take VS2.  Just make it so taht you tell him when it pops and you call it and he can bring in the people to do it.<br>
Faydedar - is EASY three groups to take him with about 53+.  I have not done this for myself yet (having him, Browney, and seahorse left) but I have been on a raid for him and trust me he is easy.<br>
<br>
P.S. there is one thing screwy with VSR, 24 hours after VS went down on my server I went in with about 5 groups (not knowing what I know now) and well....he didn't spawn.  I was then talking to a friend in Afterlife (best guild on my server and rate the best by Verant) and he said that he was up approx. five hours after the real VS went down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usunndew.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sunndew</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/28/01 2:46:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Y'all must be insane.

AS for VS2 His spawn is simple to get to, and on Xegony there are no mobs that spawn inside the room.   Be careful becuase there are mobs that spawn in adjacent rooms.  Get with another druid/range that does not have epic and work out a camp schedule. (note: on Xegony right now VS remains are camped 24/7. You have to waite in line :( )<br>
Faye, Well I dont know about the new spawn, I got lucky and got him before the trigger.<br>
Be patient and it will come.  I was very fustrated with my epic but I finally got it after 4 months of having all componets except the stone that drops off of VS.  I know how you feel.  Keep up hope, and take every offer you get for help.<br>

This means turning the comp speakers all the way up and sleeping ( if u can call the closed eye Matrix state of halfway between dream and reality sleeping) next to the computer.  I woke up everytime the thunder crashed in Timorous Deep and had a Toon Sitter to watch the spawn when I stumbled, zombie-like into work (yes I work for Gateway full time and took 3 vacation days during that period).  <br>
<br>
So, please, no whining about a VSR spawn that is as easy as the Ancient Cyclops or Stormfeather.  The druid epic is a source of pride and should generate an extreme sense of accomplishment for those with the fortitude (or lack of a real life if you prefer) to complete it.  If it gets any easier they might as well have the gnome in SOL, you know the one who sells the Tinkerers Bag, sell it for 20K.  Or, perhaps, you could buy one and get the second for half price.<br>

I am sorry to say, but yes you do have to invest a good amount of time in this quest and you do have to have a certain amount of luck...<br>
<br>
If you are not able to put in six months of work (well thats what I put into it *before changes [except Fay, who they changed after a week of myself camping him]) then no you will not be able to obtain this weapon/complete the quest.  This is an epic quest and is supposed to require a large amount of work.  Epics are a source of personal accomplishment.  Would you want all quests in EQ to be completeable within 3 hours of work so that EVERYONE that plays EQ can obtain them?  I dont think anyone would want that, because it would make them all easy to do and no pride, sense of accomplishment, or fun could be had in obtaining all your end game gear/trinkets within a week, or 24 hours played time.<br>
<br>
They nocked down the time it requires to obtain the druid epic drastically since the Faydedar changes.  I know, thats the last peice I needed and I already had a week and a bit of camping Fay at the spires, in which time I caught Fay for a friend of mine, and I was expecting to be camping him for at least a week more before I got my piece.  Yes I am glad he was changed, but I also have to live with the fact that the druid epic is no longer a *rare* epic, but that is fine with me, I hold it as a personal accomplishment that is probably one of the best I have done in EQ considering the time, luck, and determination that I needed to have to complete the quest.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the epic quest, it is a great source of fun and frustration, but when completed... it is just great.<br>

Here's my problem, I am (recently promoted) the guild leader of a guild in which the highest member is 46.  I am a relatively casual player.  I can't let EQ consume me.  I play at tops 3 hours per day.  <br>
<br>
So from what I gather the epic is basically out of my reach, because I can't camp the spawns.  It's just not a possibility.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to see if that was really how it was.  I may as well just build up and do Dwarf/Dragon quests on pickup raids.  For unless they put 10 more hours in the day I will never be able to camp a 24 hour spawn.<br>

I think you missed the key points.  VSR 'usually' spawns 22 to 26 hours after last VS or VSR kill.  On our server, everyone usually knows when the last VS kill was, so we just start camping the VS Courtyard around 20 hours later.  You can pull mobs in to get exp while you wait as well so its not even that bad a camp.  <br>
<br>
Fayd does take 3-4 groups of 52+ with around a dozen tanks total and at least 1 CH cleric per group to be safe.  Shaman buffs required and chanter buffs a big plus.  <br>
<br>
For me, VS was actually easier pre-patch because I could just plan to be on for the inevitable VS raid right after each patch and finally got my chance to roll/loot.  Fayd change was a major bottlneck-breaker though.  Before that patch I'd say we saw about 1-2 new epics per month on our server.  Now its more like 1-2 per week (if not more).<br>
