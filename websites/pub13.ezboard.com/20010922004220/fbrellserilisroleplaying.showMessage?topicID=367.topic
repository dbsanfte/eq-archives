Death. Destruction. The wails of the dying echo in his ears as he watches the Necromancer walk through the battlefield, chanting, his eyes blazing with the hatred long burned into the spirits of the Teir’Dal. Great magics tear the air; flesh rots; men, women and children scream in horror. Suddenly, from amidst the carnage, a warrior stands, raising his sword to steal the life of the elvish necromancer. “No!!!” He thinks to himself. Running, he raises his own sword, thrusting it through the warrior in one motion, saving the life of the Dark Elf Necromancer. Power emanates from the cowled necromancer as he turns his strong gaze upon his saviour. <br>
<br>
“You are truly a marvelous servant Gonaner. Once again you have saved the life of this world’s most powerful necromancer. Without you the lightborn would not flee before me, fouling themselves in sheer terror. You, my pet, are truly the reason I am the evil that I am.” The necromancer spreads his arms, motioning towards the surrounding carnage. “This is all because of you pet. Revel in the glory!”<br>
<br>
___________<br>
<br>
“Listen ta da Bloondo!” Gonaner’s daydream is shattered quite violently as the half-eaten bone of some unfortunate soul bounces off his skinless skull. <br>
<br>
Gonaner rubs his head and answers with a defeated sigh, “Yes Master, how might I serve the world’s most powerful..”  * sigh *  “Shadder Knight?” Gonaner studies the one he calls master. An Ogre.. of all the insults. Gonaner sighs again..it seems he’s been doing that a lot lately. He watches as his * choke *  master speaks with another ogre. They are trying to work a deal on what looks like a half-eaten leg of a horse. Gonaner grits his teeth, there was a time he would have killed both of these idiots just for breathing the same air. <br>
<br>
A look of pride passes across Bloondo’s face. “Dat’s right! Da Bloondo is da wurld’s powferlest Shadder knight.” Bloondo turns to the Ogre merchant he has been dealing with. “Didja hear dat?”<br>
<br>
The merchant looks confused, “Who Bloondo?”<br>
<br>
Bloondo’s look of pride quickly turns to one of anger, “Who da Bloondo? I’M DA BLOONDO!” Bloondo draws his black-bladed sword and begins shaking it, “SEE DIS???”<br>
<br>
The merchant nods his head that he does, “Dat’s nice. Dat gud sword, but if yer da wurld’s most powerful Shadder Knight. How comes you got such a teeny pet?” The merchant points at Gonaner, “I tink hims sick.”<br>
<br>
Gonaner chokes. An Ogre insulting him? The skeleton almost growls.. “You listen to me you unwashed, uncouth, ignorant piece of..mmmph”<br>
<br>
“Gonaner!” Bloondo claps a filthy hand over his pet’s mouth and smiles a crooked half-toothed smile at the merchant. “Hims just kiddin’. Hims a funny pet, him too small to be wort anytin’, but him smart.” <br>
<br>
The merchant furrows his brow angrily, “Me don’ know what hims meant, but you shud tell hims to shaddup when real live Ogres are tradin’. Hims nuttin’ but pile of bones and mes will crush him and gnaw hims up! Now, you want to buy spicy Drake leg or wut?” The merchant smiles, “My wife make da bestest Drake legs in dis town.”<br>
<br>
Drool begins to run freely down Bloondo’s chin, “Ya me wants dat. How much?”<br>
<br>
The merchant squints his one good eye and looks Bloondo up and down. “Sebun silver”<br>
<br>
Bloondo’s eyes widen “Sebun? Sebun?” Bloondo paces  back and forth in front of the hanging leg, stopping occasionally to sniff it. “Bloondo gives you five silvers.”<br>
<br>
The merchant growls, “You say my wife’s cookin’ idn’t wurt sebun silver? I shud crack yer head!”<br>
<br>
Bloondo’s eyes narrow, “You threatenin’ da Bloondo?” The ugly Ogre’s hand moves over his sword once again.<br>
<br>
“Six silver, six copper, but dat it, no less.” The merchant watches Bloondo’s hand closely.<br>
<br>
“Five silber, sebun copper.” Bloondo stares at the Drake leg hungrily, wiping drool from his mouth.<br>
<br>
“..for the love of…” Gonaner mutters.<br>
<br>
“six silvers, two coppers”<br>
<br>
“I gib you six silbers, one coppers! Dat it!” Bloondo says angrily “Gimme Drake leg! BLOONDO HUNGRY!”<br>
<br>
The merchants snarls and slams his fist into a cooking pot. “Deal! Six silvers, one copper! Show me da moneys!”<br>
<br>
Bloondo opens up his coin pouch. “only gots a gold. You gib me change.”<br>
<br>
The merchant looks at the gold piece and scratches his head. “How much I gib yu?”<br>
<br>
Gonaner sighs.<br>
<br>
Bloondo scratches his…well not his head. “You sellin’ da meats, you sposed to know.”<br>
<br>
Gonaner clears his throat “The change would be three silver pieces and nine copper pieces.”<br>
<br>
“You shut up when da Bloondo trying to make deal!” Bloondo raps Gonaner on the head with an armored fist, “Bloondo tryin’ ta tink!.”<br>
<br>
“Of Course Master. Good luck to with that ….you moronic bastard….”<br>
<br>
“Wut yu say?”<br>
<br>
“I said you were a marvelous master.” <br>
<br>
“Dat right.” Bloondo turns back towards the merchant, “Bloondo smart, Bloondo say I gib you dis gold piece and yu gib me back tree silbers and nine coppers.”<br>
<br>
Gonaner sighs.<br>
<br>
_________<br>
<br>
Gonaner feels sick. Even though he no longer has a stomach, watching his Ogre master eat still makes him feel ill. They have been walking through Nektulos forest for some time. Gonaner hates walking through Nektulos. He hates seeing the lucky skeletons that serve Teir’Dal masters. Seeing them sneer at him, armed with their fine swords, some even with magical ones. Gonaner looks down at his own rusty weapon. Why does Innoruuk hate him so? He had served him so well in life, why is he being punished now? It’s not that he minds being a slave so much, but to an Ogre? At least it’s storming, no one can see him in the darkness. Suddenly Bloondo stops.<br>
<br>
“Look at hims. I bet hims is rich.” Bloondo points down the trail.<br>
<br>
Gonaner peers down the trail through the pouring rain, finally, he begins to make out a shape. It’s a human. A paladin obviously as he is dressed in the armor of Ro and his shield bears the emblem of Mithaniel Marr. <br>
“Go kills him!” Bloondo takes a bite out of the Drake leg and points at the Paladin, “Attack! Attack!”<br>
<br>
Gonaner stares at his master incredulously, “I don’t think that is a good idea master.”<br>
<br>
Bloondo’s raises his sword at Gonaner, “Bloondo is da wurld’s greates Shadder Knight. Dat little man down der don’t scare me. Now yer master telled you to attack!”<br>
<br>
“But master he’ll kill us bo….wait you’re right!” Gonaner’s eyes glow red as he raises his rusty sword and charges down the trail. Reaching the paladin, Gonaner makes a half-hearted swing, making sure that he hits the paladin’s armor, as not to injur him. <br>
<br>
“What tha..” the knight, draws his own sword in surprise.<br>
<br>
“Kill me.” Gonaner says. “Hurry up. My master’s right up the trail. He’s an Ogre, you’ll kill him easily, but kill me first.”<br>
<br>
“I can do that minion of Innoruuk, prepare to meet your doom!” The knight raises his sword to strike Gonaner’s death blow, when suddenly the ground shakes with thunder and a bolt of lighting rips from the clouds, striking the Paladin’s upraised sword and killing him instantly. Gonaner sighs as he looks down at the smoking corpse. The gods really do hate him. <br>
<br>
Gonaner hears Bloondo scrambling down the trail behind him. The ogre stops dead in his tracks when he reaches the paladin’s body. Turning he looks wide eyed at Gonaner “See? I am tha wurld’s most powrfulest Shadder Knight!”<br>
<br>
Gonaner sighs.<br>
<br>

&lt;ooc&gt; Ya, I'm retired, but was writing stories for my AO character and scribbled this one out. Humor definitely isn't my strong point, but I thought it was a funny idea. An ogre's pet that's smarter than his master...oh the humanity.<br>
