First Post! Woo Hoo!<br>
Below I would like to share how to get all the Vox loot you can carry. I will then propose a question to ask if anyone knows of a better way.<br>
<br>
First, get in on the raid rotation for Lady Vox.<br>
When your turn comes up, invite others to come along. Use the following loot rules.<br>
Claim a paladin book for a paladin in your guild. If a kayruul's mystic pouch drops, a monk in your guild will take it and offer in its place a tinkerer's bag and 1k plat. Claim all doubles that might drop. Explain that Lady Vox rarely drops doubles, but if she does, your guild claims them. (This is an important one)<br>
<br>
Now, take at least 50 people on your raid. I recommend 4 tank groups, at least 2 caster groups, an enchanter group to mana drain and stun, and everyone else in antoher group. Take along a group of high level buffers as well.<br>
<br>
Be sure to bring along an ice comet spell and a tinkerer's bag when it comes time to raid Lady Vox! =)<br>
Put a caster from your guild as leader of each group. This makes it easier to keep tabs on people. And you can use the guild chat to convey things quickly (and secretly).<br>
<br>
Slay the ice giants. Buff up for Lady Vox. You dont want to take any chances.<br>
Send in Tank 1 and 2. Wait till most of them die. Send in Tank 3 and 4 and the enchanter group to mana drain. By now Lady Vox will be almost at 50% life. (To guarentee victory, you should debuff Lady's Vox fire resistance too) Send in the nukers and call the enchanters to stun. She will fall quickly. (You did bring an overwelming force didn't you?)<br>
<br>
Now, loot Lady Vox and see what she has. If she dropped a paladin book, claim that 2 books dropped. Take something else off her corpse instead of the 2nd paladin book. If she dropped a Kayruul's mystical pouch, loot it for your monk. If not, loot something else. Claim that 2 ice comet spells dropped and loot 2 more things. Random the one you brought if any wizard there actually wants it. (Chances are they will not.) At this point, there might be 1 or 2 more things on Lady Vox. If there are 2 items, loot another item, its fun =)<br>
<br>
Now rez everyone and random off that last item from Lady Vox along with the tinkerer's bag and that ice comet spell if necessary. Congratulate everyone on an excellent raid! Then go sign up for a Lord Nagafen raid.<br>
<br>
Can anyone else think of a better way to obtain all the Lady Vox loot you want?<br>
(Note: Scam alert. The surgeon general does not recommend that you sign up for any raid where the raid leader claims all 'doubles' for their guild. It has also been shown that item substitution can also lead to theivery.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualvimar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alvimar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/7/01 9:26:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How to get Lady Vox to drop what you want</span><hr size=1> What was the point to this?

How often does a RBB drop vs. that damn cleric mace?<br>
<br>
Generally each group has a hosting guildmember so no matter who gets the kill, someone can check the drops as soon as she dies, and chances are, someone not in the hosting guild will be in this quasi-random group to see if anything gets looted.  Too hard to pull all this together, I doubt it would happen myself. <p><p><font face="Arial">Hawkline Monster<br>

Because we did claim all doubles (there was only doubles of the paladin book, which I claimed one and the other was rolled) And we let our monk trade in the tink bag for a Vox bag. Also 2 Ice Coment Spells did drop (and no one needed those) And a white scale dropped. No one from OOS other than me getting my book got loot off of Vox, unless you count the monk trading the tink bag for the vox pouch<br>

<br>
Hawkline: It does not matter if Vox drops good or bad loot. The point is that you can get it.<br>
<br>
Alvimar: Are you saying you would rather be ignorant of possible scams? My point is that this claiming of 'doubles' looting rule I've seen recently can easily be abused and thusly, I do not support nor recommend you go on raids using this looting rule unless you trust the raid looter.<br>
<br>
Walrus: It was meant to represent all Vox raids that are successful. However, since you have done a raid and claimed doubles on that raid, two questions for you. 1) -Could- you have easily walked away with loot? Not that you did, but would it have been possible? 2) Why claim doubles for your guild? There are many different looting rules that can be employed, out of curiosity, what made you pick that one as your looting policy?<br>
<br>
After further thought, a better modification to the scam above would be to have 2 white dragon scales drop instead of 2 paladin books. Claim one white dragon scale for someone unnamed in your guild. Reasoning - Paladin books are easier to track. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=walrus>walrus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/7/01 5:28:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> Why did I claim doubles? Well I am totally against outright claiming of items on dragon raids. I been on many where they were claimed and hated it. I did want to see my guild maybe get one item that would be nice, so I decided hey, I will claim doubles. Since doubles don't drop very much at all, it was basically just a shot in the dark for my guild to claim something without screwing everyone else on the raid over. So by only claiming doubles and not a piece outright, it sort of guaranteed all the people that signed up, if something good dropped, they would be allowed a roll on it, and not have to worry about me or my guild claiming something. But.. I have a question for you, why would someone who is scamming people be forced to claim doubles as their excuse? there is no message that so and so looted 4 or 5 items from vox. The scammer could just say, oh look a cleric hammer dropped, who wants in? And then just pocketed everything else for himself. I think that saying guilds that claim doubles should be looked into as being scam artists is unfair. You should point the finger at those people that just claim pieces outright.<br>

And no, ingorance is a bad thing in any form but as I said why phrase things this way?<br>
<br>
Could have just as easily come here asking thoughts on rules for raids claiming doubles... the melodrama played out in your thread looks more like an accusation than a discussion as Walrus attested to in his response...<br>
<br>
Just consider what you're posting first is what I'm saying... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhawkline.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hawkline</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>D-O-R-K</span><br>  Posts: 1373<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/8/01 8:47:00 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0096m/images/tthlogo.gif width=120 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> I agree, this was meant to be and will be interpreted an accusation of wrongdoing on tuesday's raid.  If a paladin book and a white scale end up getting randomed, I'd feel that excellent loot was dropped (what could they have stolen?).  It's difficult for people to waltz off with RBB's or eyepatches without people knowing about it (although it is getting easier all the time).  It would likely turn up at some point, and would be far too risky to ruin your reputation over.<br>
<br>
You definitely did cast aspersion on that raid's leaders, as now I am wondering what happened now, and many others who read this thread are likely wondering also.  Without any evidence or proof, you have definitely cast a shadow of distrust upon that raid, and possibly upon yourself. <p><p><font face="Arial">Hawkline Monster<br>

However, instead of turning this into something from the rants board, I will specify my opinion on loot rules and reiterate my point.<br>
<br>
Claiming of an item to be announced: Bad form. Do not go on these raids.<br>
Claiming of a specific item that is not the scale nor the book: Bad form. Do not go on these raids.<br>
Claiming of all doubles and triples: Can be abused. Do not go on these raids.<br>
Claiming of the book or the scale (i.e. an epic or quest item) for the raid leader or a guild mate on the raid: Fine and dandy. Go on these raids.<br>
Claiming of all coin and gems for the guild: Fine and dandy.<br>
Randoming all loot dropped to people in attendance that will use it: Fine and dandy.<br>
<br>
Here is my personal sentiment on the raid looting issue. If the raid leader is more inclined to give the loot drops to people not on the raid (i.e. in their guild) instead of people that are on the raid, then do not go.<br>
<br>
Sounds fine, in theory. Hurray, fair loot distribution. Nothing funny or weird. However, if we follow Cart's advice, 'If you don't like the loot rules, don't go!' how long will I wait before I go on a dragon raid? Looks like the only raids I'll be going on will be the ones I lead.<br>
<br>
<br>
Walrus: Dragons always drop 6 or 7 things. I am not saying guilds that use this loot rule should be looked into. But rather, that this loot rule can be abused.<br>
<br>
Al: I thought that having a text book Vox Raid spelled out step by step including looting rules would best explain how this loot rule can be easily abused. I guess I must apologize for the sarcasm in the original post. I thought that humor would help to keep it from being a boring read. I wasn't putting something up for discussion. I put up a possible scenario where a specific loot rule can be abused. A theory as it were, which I have yet to see disproven. No accusations, no evidence, no proof, just a theory. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/12/01 5:13:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res007bh/BrianPic_copy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Right, once again, from the top</span><hr size=1> This is a retarded flamebait thread.

BTW, noone is interested in your analysis of various loot policies.
