<br>
The Bloodgill Goblins inside the Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
The Goblins will start to green out (exp green) at 48th though most will still be blue, and the burning woods is better exps once you get the 49th level spells.<br>
<br>
In the middle of the lake is a large hill underwater.  It is basically a round hump underwater (A large white hump of stone underwater).  At each of the four corners of the hill, is a spawn of two Bloodgill Goblins.  They range in level from 34th to 38th level.  They are always warrior mobs (not spell castors), and they only have about 1500 hitpoints.  Max hits are around 70 to 80 damage.<br>
<br>
A solo druid can be very successful in hunting these using a Root/DoT method.  Quad Kiting is possible, but is WAY to problematical.  Pulling mobs from underwater to land is VERY difficult.  Usually you will only serve to aggro the mobs, and perhaps leave a Bloodgill roaming on the land above creating a nasty mob that will slaughter the lower levels hunting above.  (kind of like a wandering specter in the Oasis)<br>
<br>
This method is very workable.<br>
<br>
- First, bring a lot of batwings and fish scales (or some other breath-underwater device).<br>
- Next, use the area at the top of the “hill” underwater to meditate.  Nothing will spawn near here, and you will be safe.<br>
<br>
(HELPFUL HINT: If you are underwater and wish to surface and be levitating above the water use this simple trick.  Cast levitate (or be levitating in the first place), then use the PAGE UP button all the way so that you are looking straight up.  Then press the forward arrow key to surface WHILE also pressing either the RIGHT or LEFT arrow key making you SPIN upward.  Once you surface let go of the forward arrow key, but keep holding down the RIGHT or LEFT arrow key until you make another complete 360 degree turn.  This will make sure that you will be fully outside the water, and able to regain your stamina from swimming.  Simply press HOME to level your vision again.)<br>
<br>
Solo Hunting guide for Bloodgill Goblins:<br>
<br>
Chosen spells to memorize: GHEAL, GATE, IMMOLIATE, DRIFTING DEATH, ROOT, FIRESTRIKE, SNARE (not ensnare), HARMONY.<br>
<br>
Usually I alternated between two corners.  This assured me that fresh spawns would be up every time I was ready to pull.<br>
<br>
Start by casting a fresh Enduring Breath/Levitate.  Then enter the water from the top of the hill and proceed to a corner.  Find the 2 goblins at that corner swimming together in close proximity.  Target the one farther away from the hill and cast HARMONY.  Ensure that the glowing aura of harmony appears below him.  Then target the non-Harmonized goblin and swim a bit back up the hill (its OK if that goblin is not in view, as long as it is inside snare range).  Snare that goblin and immediately cast ROOT.  This will root the goblin in the water near you and bring him away from the other goblin.  Cast both Immolate and Drifting Death, then swim up the hill a bit more (do not get out of range of the goblin or he will teleport to you when root breaks.  Usually swim only a few more feet up the mountain, but sometimes you do not have to even do that, it just depends on how close the goblin got to you before being rooted (it takes practice.))<br>
<br>
Eventually Root will break, and you will have to Re-Root.  You can choose to cast DRIFTING DEATH again, or Firestrike/Root to finish the goblin off.<br>
<br>
Once the first goblin is dead, make sure you have at least 60 percent mana left and full hp, and pull the second.  Fight this one the same way.<br>
<br>
Once you are finished with the 2 goblins at that corner, return to the top of the underwater hill.  Surface, and meditate.  When you are full mana go to the second spire and repeat. Usually I had to replace Levitate every spire, but my other buffs would last for 4 kills before needing to be reapplied.<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
- I used snare rather then ensnare to save a bit of mana, since you only snare to pull it away from its partner and not to kite.<br>
- There are a few more Bloodgills down below, but these are hard to see, and I feel that they are harder to handle then the spire spawns.<br>
- Faction hits are negative with goblins (who cares), and positive with the Pirates of Gunthak.  I have not seen the Pirates yet, but I have killed enough of these to be nominated the new captain I am sure =).<br>
- Be sure you practice your underwater fighting skill a bit before you try this.  Fight some of the lesser fish in Kedge Keep to practice this style, as you will get interrupted a LOT more underwater (since any hit by the creature will move you and cause you to be interrupted.)  Also you will need to wait a BIT longer after you stop moving to be able to cast a spell (you stay moving longer underwater.)  Fighting on the hill is best, as you will always have land underneath you.  Otherwise the sinking into the water will cause you to be interrupted.<br>
- Loot is only average.  Research components, and plat.  The most common drop is an ancient coin for the bard tambourine quest (worth 6 cp at a vender).  A VERY rare drop is the Harpoon of the Depth (the goblins never loot weapons, so if you see one with a spear congratulate yourself), it currently sells for about 1,000pp.  Same ratio as Yak, but no proc.<br>

Harmony one of the pair and pull the other with Ensnare.  You need to judge your swimming speed on the way in so you do not out-run their agro range, but you can stop and DOT them as you swim in and finish off on land.  Before the last patch (that changed the snare/run threshold) I even pulled 4 out of the water at once and quad - kited them on the shore.  This is a little risky while you're getting 4 of them snared in the water (I kept buffs and chloro up), but very effective - these things don't have very may HP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/udreazhan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreazhan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/27/00 4:27:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hunting guide for BloodGill Goblins (45th - 48th)</span><hr size=1> /em salutes the mighty Paldor once again.<br>

Great guide !  Very well written !!<br>
<br>
Not meant as a knock against your method at all, I appreciate your offering<br>
to share your knowledge with others !  You have inspired me to share my<br>
experience too.<br>
<br>
Another method that I used with great success in levels 45-50 is this.<br>
<br>
1st ...  Get your Swimming skill up<br>
<br>
Fresh levitate (every pull)<br>
Enduring Breath (every other pull)<br>
HP and AC buff up<br>
wolf form up<br>
<br>
Swim down and just swim up to a BG gob and hit it if need be, get it's aggro<br>
Do the same to it's partner (they appear in pairs, you'll see)<br>
-- You just lost about 10-30% of your HPs  it's ok  ~  really<br>
## SWIM TO THE SURFACE IMMEDIATELY ##<br>
<br>
Now for the first few times just do two at a time ( to practice )<br>
<br>
Expert level --  Run over to another pair, aggro them too<br>
--Now your down to about half health<br>
<br>
** You still have all your mana  :)  **<br>
<br>
Ok now you got a group of BG gobs on your tail<br>
and your floating above the water<br>
<br>
Take the BGs to the shore<br>
<br>
target one and ensnare<br>
(use ENSNARE)<br>
Target the pack that runs out in front of the snared one<br>
turn and run back past the snared BG<br>
(run like a oval track)<br>
ensnare the next BG<br>
** repeat till all BGs are snared **<br>
<br>
Group em up  ....<br>
<br>
Lightning strike (blast at 49)  till dead<br>
<br>
Did I ever die doing this ?  Yes a few times<br>
was it worth the exp loss ?  OH YES<br>
could I make up the exp faster by another Quad round than waiting for a rez ?  Definatlely<br>
<br>
Good luck with whatever method you choose, it's ALL fun, Bloodgil goblins are lots of fun !!<br>

Quad kiting couldn't be easier... having the proper buffs on is imperative though.  But by dragging four to the beach and using ensnare you can get them grouped.  With chloroplast on i never drop below 3 bubbles of health.<br>
<br>
Before 49 I would quad kite and still have 2 bubbles of mana left.  Now I can quad kite (2)... for a total of 8 gobs and still have (1) bubble left.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Baggley for this great suggestion... It truly made lvl 45 a breeze.<br>
<br>
I plan to ride this wave through 50. And with the harpoon that drops every so often (sells for at least 1000pp), it is a very profitable way to hunt. :)<br>

Have fun.<br>

There are lots more than what is described above, it appears, and she didn't mention a hill with 8.  So it seems I am very confused about where exactly in the lake this is.  Could someone describe this better for me? Perhaps in terms of what is visible above water? I heard they were around &quot;4 posts&quot; but I dont see only 4 posts, so /shrug.<br>
<br>
Also- there is a &quot;marauder&quot; that is in a bunch of bloodgills- did anyone ever run into this?  <br>
<br>
Lastly, I have seen a barracuda on tracking and have heard it is pretty nasty when it hits. How does this factor in?<br>

I did these for my first time last night, and dinged into 47 =) YEAH!<br>
<br>
First, answering Shaiel's question: As you look above the water, there are at least one (think two) items that seem to be pilons lifting up a roof.  At the base of these pilons is where the goblins sit.  Use tracking to find the first one, then just keep swimming along the edge to the next...etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Second, for you quad kiters.....I am a very experienced quad-kiter.  Taking Overthere 39 to 44, spirocs at 46, etc.  These goblins WOOPED my fanny!  I guess i have to learn water pulling but it seemed that when I surfaced, there was a 50% chance that the ones I pulled would NOT surface, and just wander about.  I couldn't cast through the water at them, so...what a pain.  WHEN they did finally get to the beach, they would attack the closest thing to them (read poor little necro who wasn't expecting a herd of gobbos running up grinning and trying to shake his hand)....what a pain.  I ended up doing the Root DOT thing. <br>
<br>
By the way....Gobbos love our root!  I use the lowest one we have (35 mana), and it lasts 2 to 3 DOTs.  I was in Heaven!  Finaly point, so I feel that I have actually added something...the way I did ROOT/DOT is to harmony one, then back Waaaaay up and use ES Sleeves on my victim.  AS SOON as I get the message &quot;_has been hit by a swarm&quot; I casted Root.  It is tough to see in that water, so if you wait until the gobbo is close enough to see, you might get many interrupts.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, please help this now dysfunctional Hobbit understand the finer points to pulling first the two, then the four to shore for quad-kiting. (do this...don't do this...) <p>Lepreckon Claddaghsheart

Pulling to the beach tips</span><hr size=1> I am sorry you have had trouble pulling these guys out to the beach, I truly think that they become MUCH easier to handle once you get them out of the water.<br>
<br>
So, here's my  Surf -&gt; Turf  guide  :)<br>
<br>
ok your on the bottom of the lake, you swim up to, and aggro the Gobs, no need to cast a spell, just smack the little buggers.<br>
<br>
Next swim straight up to the surface ( be careful if your under one of the two platforms, the ones with the roofs ) you don't want to swim up underneath the platform and get stuck ~trust me~<br>
<br>
The Gobs are going to be right behind smacking ya all the way, they swim faster that you do.<br>
<br>
when you get to the surface run a SHORT distance across the surface of the lake (with lev) turn 180 deg  and LOOK for the gobs, you will see their tags or their heads. run backwards !!<br>
<br>
Running backwards slows you down a bit, but in wolfform you are faster running backwards (with lev) than the gobs are swimming.  so you can watch them !!!  all the way to the beach !!<br>
<br>
I ALWAYS used this approach you can slow down if you are starting to get too far ahead of them.<br>
<br>
One more point here,  if the Gobs are too widely spaced run a big circle around them, or a oval, or Z pattern, to group them up !!<br>
<br>
You want to have a place in mind to pull them too in advance, so who cares if you can't see where your going, your gonna get to the beach..  just want to be sure you keep the Gobs close to you.<br>
<br>
next ..  where to pull ?<br>
<br>
Pull them to a nice wide open spot...  You know where the river meets the lake, standing in river, facing lake, take a right on the shore, run a short distance on the shore untill it opens up into an open flat clearing. This is the best spot I have personally found to kite, lots of room, seldom found other PCs in this area.<br>
<br>
Have fun !!!<br>

<br>
Yesterday...one hour of hunting, 3/4 bubble in lvl 47.  Not bad for me.  Was pulling with ES arms, roooting with lowest root, immolate...blast with Luminescent Staff =) two thirds of the time they didn't break, root.  The times that they did, just rooted again, backed up...sleeves, rinse, repeat.  However, that is only one at a time. I much prefer the rush of quadkiting.<br>
<br>
Last question...how rare are the deepwater harpoons?  Do they only show up on a gobbo in a particular location?  Night before last, my friend and I looted two; both were on the running edge of a building.  Last night, a shaman had that area camped, so I was hunting the ones on the bottom of the lake, and never did see a Harpoon down there.  Any experiences?<br>

<br>
so lemme work out an example and you all can let me know if i got it right:<br>
 <br>
Swim down, aggro 2  swim over aggro 2 more (after youre good at doing just 2) lead them all up to the beach, then ensnare, round em up and let em fall?<br>
<br>
That correct?<br>
<br>
Also very important... what lvl should my swimming be before i try and do this...<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Did Tri-Kiting due to unexpected adds.  I used the suggestions above, and waited up top for me to see their heads before hitting the beach.  Expect some excitement as snaring while two or three are agro is a challenge.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
<br>
My Root/DOT with the Sleeves is very very quick, may be quicker than to ol' quad kite (when you include all the swimming and running).<br>
<br>
Third:<br>
Beware the Bloodgill Goblin Maurauder (looks exactly like the other bloodgills).  I did not even know there was a nasty down there until he was an add.  Ended up getting him down to half (at least 2000pts to get to half) - and he gated.  He wouldn't accept a root, took many many times for a snare, and was hell even on land.  Hits like a son-of-a-gun, and only took a small portion of each lighting strike.  I had a tough time surviving at 47, some of you 45's might want to be extra careful.  I understand that he is part of a Veeshan Peek quest, by the way.<br>
<br>
Fourth, and finally:<br>
These gobbos are getting camped quite often now.  We druids have the advantage of the camping necros and shamans due to our tracking.  If you show up and a group is doing the pillars, recommend you track and aim at the oldest three....those will be the ones on the ground by a cave entrance.  You should not have any competition for those.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okie, that exhausts the value that I can add =)<br>
<br>
...sooo close to 48 now! One hour per bubble average.<br>
<br>

I think I'll take my newly 44 druid there tonite to see what kinda trouble I can get into :)<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if the gobbies can be pulled single with a 51 Cleric?  His swimming skill is MUCH higher than mine :(<br>
<br>
Also, do the gobbies give exp at 51?<br>

your other question -- but it will be green xp.  They run from 35 to 39 in level, at least<br>
according to this site :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/ficticiousname9/zone/Lake_of_Ill_Omen.html">www.geocities.com/fictici..._Omen.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
They show the maurader as being level 40 with 3K hp.  On the west side of the structure at<br>
the lake floor is a door -- the maurader is just inside.  There is one bloodgill on either side of<br>
that doorway and another by each of the pillars a bit out from the door.<br>
<br>
I managed to pull 2 up on land and multi kite them but had to med kite the second due to<br>
2 complete resists.  I only have 169 wis at level 41 with no mana items so I just went with<br>
root/dot from then on.  I did it underwater at first but now and then got Pond Sturgeons<br>
bugging me -- no real damage from them but interrupting spells so I drag them out on land<br>
to kill 'em now.  Very nice xp -- dinged into 42 pretty quick and so far looks like maybe 14<br>
kills per bubble of xp so 70 kills to 43.  The new blue line in the xp bar makes guestimating<br>
much easier -- I like it =)<br>
<br>
Rotting takes me 7 to 7 and half minutes (that is from the time I'm fm and ready to dive in<br>
the water until I get back to that point again) and respawn seems close to 17 min to me<br>
so I can keep 3 spots going usually unless I get bad resists.  I pull one from the SE corner<br>
with harmony, then one from the NE corner.  Then just alternate after that and as long as<br>
I don't slow down I never have to harmony again since I pull about 2 minutes before the<br>
2nd one would pop on the opposite corner.<br>
<br>
I have 188 swim skill and as long as I pull from a distance I can beat them to shore even if<br>
they resist ensnare.  If they are snared I stop once half way to throw the first dot on them<br>
and let them catch up almost.  Then wait right by shore until their head comes bobbing in.<br>
For the most part nothing is here right at the east shore but a little but further in is a goblin<br>
fort/ruin.  Every so often one or 2 gobs will spawn or run down that way but haven't had any<br>
trouble killing them while rotting the bloodgill yet.  They are only high teen to mid 20's.<br>
