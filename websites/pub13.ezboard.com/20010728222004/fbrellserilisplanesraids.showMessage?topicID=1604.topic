We have helped another guild with Inny and lost only because he gated, here again, we will be back.  Were on Dragon faction for Skyshine armor quests.  We've attempted Zlandicar, lost and will be back.  We have learned alot along the way.  Weve been in DN, and ToV.  And killed many Dragons.  Been to PoG.  Done Fear in 3 hours, without CT.  And personally, i'm being kept so busy between Abyss and helping other guilds on raids that I don't have time to try to get into SR raids anymore.  I was in DN and ToV within a week of Velious being opened.  My first Kael raids were with Mufat and SR friends.  <br>
<br>
So basically, i'm not whinning.  Listen carefully now.  I just want to know what the rules are for this new FCFS world that Brell has entered.  <br>
<br>
Take PoS for insistence, where you have no choice but to advance through island by island.  Does it mean that as soon as a guild camps in say PoS for the night with intentions to continue the next day, that another guild can come in and basically leapfrog the first guilds work and take out the bosses regardless of the first guilds desire to do those same bosses?  Or is it expected that someone will ask the first guild their intentions and honor them?  If there is no one to ask from that raid (they already camped), how will the second guild know the intentions of the first guild.  Does it get posted and if posted, will it get honored?  I've heard that some guilds refuse to wade through the posts to see what is happening, so what then?  What is the mechanism for communication here?<br>
<br>
Ok, next is PoG, say a guild goes to PoG and starts to clear to the Bosses they want.  Another guild zones in and wants the same bosses?  This one is easy, the second guild asks the first guilds intentions, right?  Then they honor them, right?<br>
<br>
Ok, now to a tougher one.  A guild decides to do say Zlandicar.  One person is there and determines that he is indeed up and mobilizes the guild.  Ok, another guild checkes and finds him up as well.  Does this become a race between the two guilds to see who can get there first and start after the Dragon?  Or does the second guild ask the first guild their intentions and honors them by letting them try first even though the first guild may take longer to get ready then the second guild will?<br>
<br>
Now I agree that a raid can invite anyone they want to help them with what they can't do alone.  And, I agree with Ganon that he or anyone should be free to help their friends when ever they are asked.  And, a guild can negotiate with a raid to come in and take out the boss that the raid will not be doing, right?  And i'm sure that if a guild/raid is in say Fear or Hate and another guild/raid wants entry, they will work with the first guild before sending people in so as to not be disruptive to the raid in progress, right?<br>
<br>
I agree with common curtesies, they should be apart of all our everyday lives.  But, will there be guidlines set out.  I would like to know what the line is so I know what not to cross, and will this line be for everyone?  Or will there be guild exceptions?<br>
<br>
Now, it seems that a couple SR members in particular have a personal grudge with me.  I challenge them, or anyone, to talk with me directly so these differences can be worked out rather then the continual snipping.  I am very aproachable.  It is quite obvious that these ill feelings are coloring to a very significant degree their responses to my posts.  I have done nothing but throw out ideas to get people talking about the future of Brell.  And if you wish not to work them out, don't read my posts.<br>
<br>
Now, someone asked me 'who made me the spokes person for Brell'?  No one, and I never saw myself as the spokes person for Brell.  I am one voice only.  I personally just want to know what are the new rules of behavior so that as I plan raids, or anyone, we all know the rules so we don't step on others toes.<br>
<br>
I really don't know why some people are so scared of some of my posts, like I said and i'll say it again.  Brell is evolving.  Many want FCFS and I would like to see some agreements made concerning FCFS or it then just becomes FFA with a lable of FCFS and everyone behaving with a different idea of what it means.<br>
<br>
Thank you <br>

The Plane of Sky is reservable.  If you have it reserved you own that day and nobody else should be there.<br>
<br>
The plane of growth is not reservable.  There are no rules preventing anyone from zoning in at any time and killing whatever is up.<br>
<br>
Zlandicar is not reservable.  I'm sure most people would yield if they knew another guild was on the way to kill him however there is no requirement to do so.  Whoever is there in force first has the right to the mob according to Verant's rules.<br>
<br>
Nobody is out to get you Sheebla.  You seem to be deeply paranoid that someone will steal from you or somehow benefit from your work in the game.  This attitude is counterproductive to establishing communication with other guilds and people.  Stop worrying about defining everything and just talk to people.  You don't see anyone else here complaining that people are stealing from them, so until it happens it would help your cause quite a bit to give everyone the benefit of the doubt rather than assuming the worst.<br>

You want to work out rules for things that by the very definition of FCFS, there are no rules for. <br>
<br>
FCFS is simply that. The first person to show up in force with a raid ready to kill the mob gets him. I'd include in that definition any raid working its way to the mob. <br>
<br>
No other rule needs to be made. PoS is reservable and therefore isnt FCFS. all the other planes and mobs... if you aren't there I don't care how much you WANT to kill it, if I have a raid crew there first its dead. <br>
<br>
If you want a certain mob the next time it gets up, just do what we do with all the other guilds capable of killing him, send a nice friendly tell asking if you can work out something to make sure you don't step on each other's raids. Ask nicely, don't tell. But if you leave him up a day or two, fully expect him to be gone. <br>
<br>
Its that simple... instead of worrying about what might happen in these longwinded posts of yours just freaking do it. If something happens work it out in game. <br>
<br>
You persist in these posts worrying about rules and this and that when the whole point of FCFS is that we are tired of long nonsense rotation lists on mobs only a few people can even attempt much less succeed in killing. Just kill it if you can, noone will be offended. We'll do the same if we can. Wala, no more worries. <br>
<br>
Expend all that nervous energy planning raids instead of rewriting the same post over and over.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

Once, when asked, they said they were bored.  This happened since the discussions regarding FCFS started in earnest and not to my guild and not to me personally.  That is why I'd like to see some guidelines established to define protocols so that this can be avoided in the future.  Not reservations on zones/mobs who nobody wants reserved.  Not a bulky systems that frustrates everyone and then ignores.  Something simple, and very clear that establishes a clear line that everyone understands.  I'm not paranoid, but I am concerned.<br>

Name some names then Sheebla.  Who is being stepped on?<br>
<br>
First come first served is a very simple concept.  The first people there win.  That's your guideline.  If you want to kill something ask the people that might also try to kill it to let you have it.  I am pretty sure that if you ask and don't try to tell them they are oppressing you they will let you have whatever you want.<br>

Also thank you to the others who made constructive comments on this post.  And to everyone else, thank you for reading the post even though you kinda strayed from the topic a bit.  <br>

You have the least to say of any use of anyone on this entire board as far as I can tell, and you enjoy making passive aggressive swipes at others then putting on a &quot;who, me?&quot; look. <br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, the only &quot;Topic&quot; on your mind is you, your needs, what you can do to satisfy your needs, and how you can trick others into helping you. <br>
<br>
Jeez, at least be upfront with your motives instead of trying to pretend like you give a flying (*)&amp;(*&amp; about anyone but yourself.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>
