Well destroy is really the wrong word,,,there really never was one.<br>
<br>
Sure there are items here or there that you can buy, but for the most part there just isn't anything there.<br>
<br>
I know most of you are the &quot;raiding&quot; druids who like to &quot;earn&quot; thier stuff one &quot;thier own&quot;.  But there others who take as much pride in attaining items through vendoring.  And that part of the game just about drys up when you get to the high levels.<br>
<br>
Personally I think that the no-drop status was a hack, and will always be such, and agree that it will never go away.  They have the power now to restrict effects and stats to levels,,,<br>
<br>
why not just the weapon itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/02 1:27:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27484.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I know most of you are the &quot;raiding&quot; druids who like to &quot;earn&quot; thier stuff one &quot;thier own&quot;.

<br>
Exactly rtfm.  Even though Verant might look at the gameplay of buying and selling as an afterthought, it really is fun for the people that do it.  I used to really enjoy bargaining, scraping my plat together to hopefully attain an item that was normally out of reach.  People act as though theres no work involved, far from it.  I 'earned' what i've bought just as much as somebody that 'camped' for it.  Plat doesnt come as easy as people make it out to be, unless your fortunate enough to already be pretty rich in items.  My 30k that i've saved has been accumulated through buying and selling since lvl 1.  From 1-60 i've constantly bartered and sold to get one nice item, then sold that item, to upgrade to another nice item, then sold that, etc, etc.  Now it just ends, bleh :P  Guess i shoulda kept my ES legs since that seems to be where it tapers off at, well, when druids are concerned.  <br>
<br>
What somebody 'earns' from a 6 hour camp of sitting, casting, and hoping isnt the only way you feel you've 'earned' something.  Each and every item i went out on a limb and sunk my EQ savings into was something i felt i 'earned'.  Of course theres the issue of ebay, but i would say the majority of people dont fall into that ebay category, always thought ebay was something people made too big a deal out of.  Many just enjoy the whole option to upgrade to a piece of equipment they normally couldnt get, if they save and work hard at it.  Soemthing i can attest to.  Sadly, that ends at the high lvls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/02 1:36:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27484.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i think one of the main problems with the item distribution is that items are grossly overweighted to group encounters.<br>
<br>
this game IS soloable, and some people prefer to solo their entire lives, and its just as valid a way to play as going the large guild raiding route.  its all about fun, right?  and anyone who pays should be able to enjoy full aspects of the game.  and soloing can be just as fun and should be just as rewarding given comparable time involvement, but that isnt the case just yet.<br>
<br>
if we saw more extensive quests or tradeskilled items come into the world that can be accomplished by solo or small group encounters and which yield good items comparable to what is gotten by raiding, it would help offset the problem with the huge majority of high end items being no drop.<br>
<br>
there should also be the route for the trading types to buy/sell for their gear and achieve good equipment for their level through wit and trading skill, which would require a larger number of tradable high end gear than is currently available.  this, too, is a valid way to play and should be able to result in high end items.<br>
<br>
the key here should be time involvement.  a solo or tradeskilling or trading person should be able to reap comparable rewards as the raiding person for equal time put in.  and i do mean equal, meaning a 30 man raid that takes two hours should yield comparable results as a 50-60 hour extensive quest. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19646">-K</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/02 1:51:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27484.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Personally I am for everything being droppable (and non-biodegradable, thanks).

<br>
Best answer was bank it for CR runs.<br>
<br>
I just see that the way the game goes...Get this set of armor, then go here to get that set,,,then go there to get this set of armor.<br>
<br>
When all the upgrading is done,,,and all that no-drop gear sitting in the bank.  Don't you kinda feel that it is just wasted time you put in?<br>
<br>
Now I'm not talking about items you quested for and used for many levels.  Obviously you got your reward out of the items.<br>
<br>
But when you are upgrading a full set every month or 2.  I can't do that,,,but I know many here do or can.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't you like to be able to get rid of the items,,,to at least get something out of your investment in time and effort.<br>
<br>
I know I would, even if my market was limited to 55+players.<br>
<br>
I don't think the game is really overweighted for this or that.  And I don't think that vendoring was an afterthought, they would not have made the /auction channel if it were.  What I see is they had/have a motive to slow down twinking.  Good motive,,,,crappy/hack execution.<br>
<br>
Broom is at 60 now,,,with 30K in the bank,,,I bet he has no idea what he wants to spend it on, if anything.  Well, I don't at least.<br>

<br>
My thoughts on all this.<br>
<br>
Ok on the rewards of being uber thing, I can understand that yes killing Vulak or Emperor or goin to VT all should earn unique and special rewards.  These things are &quot;beyond the norm,&quot; and as such should have beyond the norm rewards.<br>
<br>
On the flip side of that, the reasoning almost implies that by not getting yourself a spot in the (at most) one or two guilds on your server that will ever hit those encounters makes you somehow deficient.  It has already been beaten to death that those folks are not really looking for druids and some other classes, so unless you are one of perhaps 10 lucky druids of the several hundred on your server you will never even see the mobs in question much less kill them.  Ok I will go crazy and say one of 30 druids out of hundreds on your server.<br>
<br>
I like the fact that they have been putting some pretty appealing stuff into the tradeskills, much as pursuing tradeskills as they stand is a veritable descent into hell.<br>
<br>
I don't know I do think that issue is about as balanced as it can get.<br>
<br>
What is NOT balanced is that many, many other classes have a richer and more extensive selection of dropable, desireable gear.  Druids just don't.  Our armor before the no drop stuff just sux.  Our good weapons are all no drop.  There are only one or two items that is truly desireable that you can actually buy - Lodi shield for instance.  I do think there should be a bit more buyable stuff out there for our class.<br>

Just look at elysian armor and high end tradeskills.  I've passed on several woven grass drops simply because elysian is better.<br>
<br>
The soloable and tradeskill items are about as close as they should ever be to raid level equipment, IMO.  Perhaps too close in some cases.  Other high end equipment can be bought or traded for with exception to the extremely high end items, which I feel needs to be left for guild to attain as a unified team.<br>

Once you equipt the &quot;uber&quot; item it becomes bonded to you and then no-drop.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
This allows for some trade of an item that no one at the raid needs.  It can be looted and sold until some one equipts it.  Then never traded again.<br>
<br>
Or...  My favorite scenero.  Person_A wins ubar_item_01.  Before Person_A loots his his ISP goes nuts and he cannot login for hours.  So Person_B loots it for him and give it to him the next day.  Person_A then equipts it and boom, it bonds and becomes no-drop.<br>

I don't see this ever happening tho.<br>

<br>
I was in a group in CT Saturday that managed to pick up 3 really nice weapons in about 6 hours. There were 2 2H weapons that were 33/36, 8 STA and 60 hitpoints, and one 17/22 PAL/SK 1HS with some INT/WIS/MANA/HP. None of these were no drop, though all 3 had a minimum level of 51. <br>
<br>
Just to compare, 2H primals are 33/35, and 1H are 13/20. Now, these don't proc avatar, but there can be no doubting the incredible dam/dly ratios of these weapons. <br>
<br>
Anyway, you might look into a bone-handled scimitar. It doesn't have a proc, but it has a nice dam/dly ratio (like that matters), and a really nice unique graphic.  <p><center>

my suggestion is the Bone handled Scimmy. it seems to be the weapon of choice before the epic. 12/24 +2 bane undead i think.<br>
<br>
the epic is one of the nicest weapons you'll ever get, unless you make it to the very high end game. you'll use it, trust me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
for 30k tho, you are much better off spending 5k on a new weapon and buying spells or MQ of SS armour with it.<br>
<br>
that's my 2cp, but it's what i do with my money.<br>
<br>
i'm unguilded, not in an uber guild, and i'm missing i think 2 luclin spells that i actually want. i own moonfire, i own mask of the hunter, i own nature's recovery.<br>
<br>
i am unguilded with all these spells, cuz i made friends here with people that are good enough to sell em to me.<br>
<br>
Xiggix for one is someone i met here and was nice enough to hook me up with some spells for great prices.<br>
<br>
there is ways around being in an uber guild and still gettin decent equipment. once i get mask of the stalker i'll call myself done in the spell area really.<br>
<br>
the other way is to just farm cash. you can make 6k+ a day if you know where to hunt, 15k+ sometimes. then just buy what you need. i paid 15k for my moonfire, made that money in 2 days including a 3k loan from a friend.<br>
<br>
hope that helps. i think your much better off spending 30k on good spells than a weapon, they will help 10x more <p>Baron Jentriken Aspenbark

I had a bone handled scimitar, sold it.  Why?  Because its not what i was looking for, its a 'plain' item.  Plain item damage is boring, and really not as effective as soemthing with a proc imo.  We miss often, and our damage for the most part is so minimal unless we have a REALLY GOOD melee weapon.  With a proc'inig item you proc even if you miss, and when we're only talking about a few swings here and there, proc'ing items imo are best for that situation.  I preferd my Ykeshan War club over the Bone Handled scimi just because the Ykeshan effect stuns.<br>

You keep using the SoD as an example, however, it is not a good one.  The SoD drops from one of the warders in ST.  Most servers have woken the Sleeper, hence, no more warders.  On the few servers that the Sleeper is indeed still sleeping, you can bet the the warders (and SoDs, Gnome Masks, etc) are being farmed.<br>

Jentriken- See last post about bone handled scimi, and its really not just about the damage because you have to understand how i plan on using it.  Its an 'in-between' shot for the most part, its not consistent melee.  My Ykesha has interrupted plenty of casters believe it or not in between my casting at times.  Even a few flurries i get proc's that interrupt.  <br>

I dont make that kinda cash daily.  I do if i get really lucky and somethign pops like the Heirophant with the shield, but i wouldnt call that a given.  I've seen that list, and honestly, there isnt much out of it that i want or would consider spending my cash on.  However, there are many No Drop items that fall into what i'd like to have.  Oh well, like i said, there isnt much that i'd like to have thats tradable.  Believe me, i've been scouring the market for awhile now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/02 4:03:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27484.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Oh lol, no wonder i dont see them all over the market.
