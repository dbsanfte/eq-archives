I also have another friend who picked brell because his character worshipped brell.<br>

I always enjoyed being a cleric in AD&amp;D.  EQ was sorta new and I didnt know how different it was from AD&amp;D.  It seemed close enough to me.  So here I am... still a cleric and more than happy with it. <br>

When we formed the Merry Band we had decided on our classes, names and races before Brell was open, so we were just waiting on a new server.  As soon as brell opened we all logged on and the Merry Band began in earnest.<br>
<br>
The original lineup was Robynn (ranger), Serecherd (paladin), Fyrtuk (cleric), Lyljon (Druid), Wyzskarlet (wizard) and me (enchanter).  We had discussed what a good 6 person group should be and that's what we came up with.  We were all pretty inexperienced at the time (most of us hadn't made it past the 20's), but for that era it was a pretty good group (Rogues and Warriors sucked at the time and wizards and rangers didn't).  I was lucky enough to get to play the enchanter, but we had almost decided on having a mage instead of an enchanter (thankfully we didn't).   Wyz chose to play the wizard because he was always ks'ed by wizards on his Solusek Ro Ranger and wanted to not have that happen to us (it still did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
We chose our races because we all wanted to play together immediately, and on the first day of the server no one could bind, so we wanted to be close to each others home towns.  Faydwer was the best place to start where all those classes could be near each other.  I thought a high elf fit the theme for Maryinn.  A pair of dwarves for the Cleric/Paladin combo seem to work well.  Wood elf druid and ranger and a gnome wizard to fill out the group.  We grouped for the first time we all played together in Crushbone, we were level 2-4.<br>

kind of strange how i ended up on brell. there was no real decision to be made as all servers looked alike to me. First character I ever made was a dark elf necro on Bertoxxulous server. I chose that server because at the time it was the first on the list. i didnt stay with the necro because i found getting around in Neriak while still learning the interface just sucked. I started a ranger and was exploring a bit when someone made a comment in /shout that somehow struck a chord. this person was basically someone who had an axe to grind with the population there and said something like,&quot;For the love of god..you dont all have to start up on this server just because its first on the list&quot;.  Brell was 2nd on the list so thats where i ended up <p><div align="left">

They both played on Brell so I played my ranger at his house to lvl 12 and bought my own computer and game.<br>
I chose a ranger and stuck with him (I am an outdoors type that loves hackin stuff and magic makes it interesting). Wood elves are more exotic than humans or half elves so I had to go the Wood elf.<br>

I have yet to have a character over level 22 though, as I tend to switch my mind a lot, so most of my friends are just old buddies of my brother.  <br>
<br>
    It's sort of funny now that I think about it, I've grown up over the past to years with the Volatilis Letum, Silent Redemption, and inde guys over the past two years just watching my brother play that I feel like I know them, even though I've probably only spoken to two or three of them on a serious basis during /tells.  That's probably why after around 20 different characters, and two years I haven't left the server....<br>
<br>
    As for my race and class, my first ever character was a dwarven rogue, back when they weren't exactly a top-notch class.  I've bounced back and forth through all the classes, and I think this one suits me the best.  Why did I choose finally to be a halfling? <br>

<br>
First Character was a shaman named Kilmarnic.  I placed all his starting stats into Str so he could be a good fighter.<br>
<br>
Made Redspine a few days after that to try out a warrior.  <br>
<br>
Picked Barbarian becuase they are crude, uncivilized and kick ass.<br>
<br>
<br>
Month after I started, got my wife to start.  I made her make a Barbarian Shaman named Chazree.  At the time, I was going to play a new warrior with her so we could level together his name was Chazrim.  Stopped playing Chazrim because Red was higher level and didn't feel like spending time.  Wish I had now becuase it would be cool for me and my wife to have those names.<br>
<br>
Made Jestur becuase our guild always needed more clerics for raiding.  <br>
Gnome becuase 1) People always picking on them 2) Very few gnome clerics out there 3) Gnomes roxurs! 4) It's just about as opposite a barbarian you can get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14052">Redspine

<br>
We 4 all played UO once upon a time.<br>
UO was fun, but I liked the pretty graphics and the sound of EQ better.<br>
I picked up EQ, and played the tutorial a few times through, but never started up the game online for about a month or 2 after.<br>
I happened to start on Prexus the very day it opened up.  It was the server with the least number of people on it, so I figured the lag would be the best to deal with with less people.  I had a level 1 Erudite wizard I levelled up to 10 there.<br>
Soon after, because it was how Smaasher and I usually operated when it comes to video games, he bought EQ because I had it already (normally vice versa).  Adune also picked up the game.  I recreated as a shaman and Smaasher was a warrior.  This was when warriors sucked, and we were getting to know how the game worked.  Smaasher wanted to recreate after 15 levels of play, while I was happy with the shaman at 14.  We decided to wait until a new server opened up to recreate on a fresh server.  That next server was Brell, that opened up very soon after.<br>
I made a wizard at first again, and smaasher was a shadowknight in this incarnation.  I know we also tried other combos of characters, like his bard and my rogue 14 Korina (who's older than Juujuu to this day).  Adune was known as Muultani the druid on the Brell.  Some time after that Muultani was sold on ebay, and Adun was born as a ranger.<br>
Meredette played on Smaasher's account up to level 40 or so.  Meredette didn't have a computer of her own capable of playing EQ I don't think, so that's why it was on Smaasher's account.  Once she got  her own computer upgraded enough, she got EQ on her own, and deleted Meredette because she couldn't get the character transferred off the account.  Aside from Smaasher trying out test server for a few levels as a rogue or a bard, and my 12 levels as a shaman on VZ and my 6 levels as a cleric on some server that came out after Brell that I can't remember, we've stuck with Brell since.  <br>
<br>
So that's how we ended up on Brell more or less.  I do remember it was dubbed the &quot;unofficial&quot; roleplaying server at the time, but I got almost no sense of it when I started playing on this server, and so I didn't mind staying on here.<br>
<br>
I think Smaasher was picked as an Ogre SK because he liked the tanking ability with spell backup, and Ogre's had the best stats.  I played the shaman because I liked the thought of using buffs to make your group members much more powerful than they'd be without them (pfft.  stat buffs?  hehe.  boy was I wrong) and female troll was the nastiest looking of all the races.  I think Meredette was a female human because Kunark wasn't out yet, not sure, so no Iksar as a possibility.  The blonde probably looked best.  I don't know for certain that this is the reason though.  And I think Adun was a half elf ranger because they had the best stats, and good faction, and we knew Blackburrow, and he wanted to make something more of a tank than what a druid was, but still retaining familiar spells. <p>=============================

I nixxed that character when I died while trying to swim.. The fishies got me!!<br>
<br>
Next got a SK Troll cause I liked the look..They are rather hard to level and I couldn't cast my pet right away cause he was so stupid, made a Troll warrior instead..leveled hard.<br>
<br>
Ended up playing a wood elf druid because traveling around on the boats, across the Karanas, etc was for the birds. Got him up to level 22, stopped playing EQ and let a friend use the account, he got him back to 35, where I played again and then left for DAOC, and now he's level 42 =) <br>
<br>
I now am playing a Eurodite Pally cause well a friend of mine just happened to have enough gear to last me into my 40's laying around..It's fun again and I'm now up to 25 =)  So theres my story =)  <p>"In theory, there is no difference between theory

Picked that one because that's where my RL friend that introduced me to EQ was. Met some very nice people and joined a good guild, but still wasn't totally happy with Cazic. We weren't thrilled with being newcomers on an old server, didn't find enough roleplaying for our tastes -- we came to MMORPGs from pen &amp; paper gaming and were veteran roleplayers already. And perhaps worst of all, we didn't like our prospects at higher levels, having heard many horror stories about powerful guilds farming entire dungeons for weeks at a time and other such abuses.<br>
<br>
So when Brell opened, billed as an &quot;unofficial roleplaying server&quot;, that seemed like a good chance to escape and we took it. It turned out to be an excellent choice. Brell isn't as much of a RP server as I'd hoped, but still much more so than Cazic. And the server culture is much more polite and considerate than most.<br>
<br>
On Cazic I played a Ranger first, then a Shaman. Both classes were good, but on Brell I wanted to try something different. I'd been reading about Enchanters and decided to go for it, and that turned out to be the right choice too. I started as a High Elf, but the horrific overcrowding in GFay was unbearable. I went with Erudite because of the relatively poor and thus relatively uncrowded newbie zone. <br>
<br>
Now the difficulty of finding groups without resorting to pick-up groups, which I hate, is forcing me to play something else, and I've settled on a Vah Shir Shaman. I liked that class before on Cazic, so time to give it another try.  <p><font color="yellow"><B><I>Cyndassa Ebonstar</B></I>,<font color="white"><BR>

So all you people that do not like me, it is Nyeland's fault I play; complain to him, not me.<br>
<br>
My first chr was an Ogre Shaman on some server. I forget which one. It was the top of the list but then the list was by server population. I remember I kept falling off of the cliffs while I was exploring the city and dying. I do not think I ever even zoned once with that charactor.<br>
<br>
Nyeland then told me to make a half elf bard in Freeport. I really was not that impressed with the Bard calss at the time. I made a High Elf Wizard and a Dwarf Paladin at about the same time. I chose both those classes because back in the AD&amp;D days my two favorite charactors was a Dwarf Warrior that found out later in life he was half Demon and a Mutant Wizard that was a Shape Shifter. <br>
<br>
I still have all three charactors. The wizard is 22 and the Bard is 16 or 17.<br>
<br>
I liked the paladin, tho. I think it is because I could be darn good with little gear and I could solo decently. A Paladin is always in the thick of the action and spends very little time just sitting around staring at a book.<br>
<br>
A bit later I decided to make an SK so I could play an evil charactor. I have not played him in awhile but he is really hateful and evil. I chose DE because of the mana pool and I knew by the time I made him that Str and Sta could be gotten fairly easially with gear, alot easier than int can be with tank gear. He is 25 and holding for now.<br>
<br>
One time in Qeynos I got nuked doing the Avenger Battle Ax quest for the second time. Seems some people in the tavern where a certain thief spawns did not like me killing the dishonorable Trumy Irontoe. I made a Monk to pull my corpse to the front gate. I made it female to test the &quot;females always get twinked&quot; rumer. Well, it is true. Buy level 5 she had two peices of cured silk, a splitpaw mask, two silver black pearl rings, a serpentine bracer, and a couple other items. She never begged or anything. she is now Mid-20's.<br>
<br>
After looking into the Bard class I decided that if I were ever to remake my Bard I would make it a woodelf, so I did. I made it a female to model my armor that I make. I decided I liked the class now I understood the class and the game better so I started playing her. She is now low 20's<br>
<br>
I decided to remake a Shammie but also wanted a model for Large Armor so I made a female Barbarian Shaman. Only after I got her up a few levels did I realize that Shammies cannot wear Plate. Since I was running out of Charactor slots I decided to keep her anyway. She is now a well twinked 18.<br>
<br>
I have taken to calling these three &quot;Krungle's Harem.&quot;<br>
<br>
I solo my Shammie still. My monk and bard are in the same place and will log on and look around the zone and see which is more needed and play that one in a group.<br>
<br>
 I love the monk because splitting is like magic and very challenging. I love the bard because it is a very active charactor and always doing several things. I love the Shammie because I can tank and play caster at the same time; med time is the shammie's drawback. <br>
<br>
As my main I have spent alot of time farming items for my alts and have learned many zones well. I think this will help me to be a great puller with my monk later on. <br>
<br>
Except for a couple of monk weapons, both my shammie and monk are geared up well enough to reach the Planes. If I strip my first bard, then my bard would be, too. My SK needs to hunt in CT now for his quest armor. As Krungle was never twinked I know to never rely on gear but to develope the skills of the class, so I think that all will be great charactors. <br>
<br>
I am planning of doing Droga (I think that is it) to get my monk her weapons and scouting CT to get the final peice of Totemic Armor and seeing what the zone is like with Krungle. After I do that I may play my SK some more and take my monk into Droga if I decide the armor drops are worth it.<br>
<br>
Krungle is still my favorite charactor, tho. I like the Grumpy Old Dwarf that is a bad @$$. I also like being old enough to explore mid level zones solo and get neat stuff. He can also get into groups in higher level zones and get neat stuff. I like going on raids and the like not necassarially to get neat stuff but to get a chance to get neat stuff and to poke fun at people. I am a loud mouthed dwarf with an off key sense of humer...call it type-casting, if you will. With my Harem I cannot be quite as bolsterious. With my SK I need to be in the right mood to play his personality well.<br>
<br>
 Also, travel wise, Krungle is old enough not to have to worry about being killed in most zones (JBoots help), my bard has MM drums and invis song so can either outrun most anything or just invis past them, my shammie has SoW so she can outrun most things, my monk can FD flop about anywhere, my wizzy can invis and gate. Only my SK still has worries when it comes to travel.<br>
<br>
Now, if you have learned too much about me and my alts, stop asking the questions! <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42321"><img src="http://members.aol.com/krungle101/krunglepsig.jpg" border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvaziirjivaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaziir Jivaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 4:20:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10663.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How did you pick your race/class/server?</span><hr size=1> Originally started on Mith Marr as Vaziir (DE ROG) with Quash (Khaal DE Cleric) and Cabri (Arramyth DE SHD).
