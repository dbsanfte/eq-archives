<br>
Why is it that everyone believes that AC is god and they try to do everything in their power to max their AC?<br>
<br>
I can not count how many times I have seen people post stupid math equations trying to figure out stats/damage/delay/etc..... Doesn't anyone every just play the damn game for fun?!?!<br>
<br>
I apologize for ranting, but I am a roleplayer that plays a &quot;roleplaying game&quot; and I enjoy the game for what it is. I DO care about stats, but I try to balance stats with appearance. If have 180 strength, but run around looking like a combo of ringmail/steel/crafted/leather....WHY!?!?!<br>
<br>
I refuse to wear full crafted. I could afford it easily, but I do not want to wear it because I think it looks dumb. I have yet to go through a day of EQ and not have someone say &quot;Why not go for crafted, the stats are alot better than your charred armor.&quot;<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for anyone that goes straight for stats and does not care about anything else, they truly are the kind of people that break games down into programming and equations and curse the fun out of a game.<br>
<br>
/em rant off.<br>
<br>
Sorry about that. As for all of you that agree with me and care about stats but still go for appearance and enjoy roleplaying. BTW, I do wear a couple pieces of crafted, but I do so only for appearance. (would never wear full set though)<br>

If they like to pay attention to stats, how does it affect your ability to enjoy your 'roleplaying' game in the slightest?  So what if someone makes a suggestion?--just tell them you like what you're wearing; they're not going to make you change.<br>
<br>
In fact, someone coming up to you and saying, &quot;Hey, if you want to be a better fighter, you might want to change to XXX armor&quot; is EXACTLY what would happen in a real world scenario and so is actually <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>better</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> roleplaying than the concept of some professional fighter choosing inferior gear for its looks instead of its protection. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;Ummm, yes, Captain, I know we're about to assault the enemy position.

<br>
I don't agree with Nillon...I doubt choosing one type of armor over another will prevent you from getting into groups.  The player's attitude and reputation are, by far, the most important factors in that regard.  However, sounds to me like you want to have the privilege of doing the things that you find fun in the game...but refuse to grant that privilege to others, instead demanding that they play it your way and only enjoy the things you do.  If they do otherwise, they are powergamers and ruining it for everyone?...get over yourself.<br>
<br>
If you want to wear armor for its appearance, that's perfectly fine.  If others want to select armor based upon its defensive ability, that's perfectly fine, too. <p><font color=8bb4d2 face="Garamond"><b>- Cope -</b></font></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=copeland>Copeland</A> at: 7/20/00 6:07:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/usoulstomper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulstomper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/20/00 9:39:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC is not god.</span><hr size=1> Copeland, perhaps you misunderstood me.

<br>
Second, if everyone is bugging you about your armor, your reputation may become.. &quot;That guy who wears the crummy armor&quot;. =D Anyway, Nillon has one point, which is that part of your rep is how you perform, and how you are equipped is an element of that. Is it the only one? Nope. But its not something that has no effect, as you'd apparently like to think. <br>

even if i like to go for AC most of the time i'm switching it for resist gear as soon as i meet a caster and i'm a real dex freak with a procing weapon ( i carry 4 bags full of extra gear on me all the time and i switch my gear all the time )<br>
<br>
i know other warriors fucusing on stats and they are still great warriors.. look at tumagok for example he's going for straight strengh and you can trust me he's doing a freaking lot of damage with a very high strengh..<br>
of course just 10 more strengh wouldnt make a big difference.. but 10 AC wouldnt do anything<br>
last time i checked though he was at 230 str or something like that... and with a strengh that high his damage is pretty heavy<br>

and anyway even if it was less effective, the person playing the warrior still matters a lot more than a higher AC or any other stat <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uthoricofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric of Brell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/20/00 4:57:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AC is not god.</span><hr size=1> Dynin-it depends on the tradeoff you are making in my opinion. AC seems to really make a big difference about every 100 points. I.e. if that big str difference is only knocking you from 890 to 870 no biggie. But if its keeping you under 900 when you could be over, I'd stick to AC. I started taking a lot less damage back when I hit 800, and i noticed a lesser but noticable improvement at 900. Anyway, you are correct in saying that a smart warrior is better than a stupid one whatever his armor class, but I still think sometimes it's worth sacrficing a look in the interest of performance.<br>

<br>
Actually, AC is not god.  Level is god.  Skill is demigod.  AC is pope, HP and resists are lesser nobles, stats are court jesters.<br>
<br>
I love having a high AC.  Getting hurt less is a good thing.  I spend less time on my butt, the healer spends less time on his or her butt.  In general it allows me to play more instead of resting.<br>
<br>
Style points are nice, too.  Honestly I will not proselytize if someone I know is playing the game their own way (at least as far as equipment).  Players who will not /assist or forget to snare, on the other hand, can take a hike.  This sort of think causes the game to absolutely not be much fun for me at higher levels.<br>
<br>
So anyway, play EQ however you want, just as long as you're not getting mr needlessly hurt or killed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ubrontothunderfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bronto Thunderfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/22/00 9:19:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hah hahah, Goat!!</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with Nillon and Thoric on this one.  Skill only goes so far. Equipment only goes so far.  The combination of the two determines how effective a player you are. I see some level 54+ tanks wearing Mith BPs, almost full quest armor and other level 35ish pieces.  I don't care how well you play your class...but by the mid-50's if you are still wearing that sort of equipment you are NOT an EFFECTIVE tank (notice i didnt say &quot;good&quot; just not effective).  You are not doing the damage you have the potential to do. You are taking ALOT more damage than you should. And these things hinder you from playing as skillfully as you would like.  If it's your job to taunt, and you're not doing alot of damage because your equipment isnt very good then you will not be able to taunt as well, no matter how good you are at getting a mob's attention through other means (pallys can with stun, but warriors, damage IS your taunt). And if you are taking alot of damage very quickly your healer is going to need to blow all of his/her mana on you, leaving him/her lom or oom for when a caster or a weaker class that is expected to take damage needs that heal.<br>
<br>
Yes, if you want to look cool, by all means wear that equip when you're in a safe camp (tearing up stuff in L Guk comes to mind) or when you're running around.  But when I'm in sebilis and the puller brings about 5 frogs and our enchanter is having trouble mezzing them...  when I look to my side in between swings during this frenzied fight, I dont want to see a warrior wearing black iron and rubicite getting his ass handed to him by some punk dar knight, I'd rather see a half-elf or ogre, or hell even gnome, standing tall and swinging furiously while the blows deflect off his indicolite and cobalt.<br>
<br>
And yes I know good armor is not easy to get...but if you have the time to level to 54+ by now than you certainly should have the time to raid the planes, or the money to buy some high-ac kunark class armor.<br>
<br>
I know this might sound kinda elitist to some, like I'm trying to insult people without the best equipment, please don't take it that way.  I'm just saying that equipment DOES matter, and CAN make you a better player.  And also remember the smaller the group, the more it matters.  In a 30+ person raid your own personal equipment might not make a big difference, but when half your group dies and 3 of you are left fighting for your lives in a close match with some baddies, every piece of equip you have on you comes into play.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Bronto this is a GAME&quot;, you'll say, &quot;we're playing it to have FUN not to worry about exp and efficiency!!&quot;<br>
And I have no problem with that...but when one death can cost you 8+ hours of play time, and advancement comes so slow (and yes advancement is alot of what makes this game fun, that's why so many people got bored at level 50) gettign exp efficiently and not dying help to make this game fun.  The same people who talk about how they just play the game for fun are often the ones who complain the loudest about how slowly they are gaining levels, or who are hurt the most when they die.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind, your equipment effects your entire group.  Never bothered getting more WIS gear? well maybe if you had you could've gotten off that extra heal before you went oom and saved the wizard's life...how many corpses have you seen at the zone line?  Or maybe if you had better ac it wouldnt have gotten interrupted.  <br>
<br>
These are just some things to ponder regarding equipment and how it effects the playing experience.  It does make a difference<br>

I tank just fine, and since AC really only matters in the hundreds, just worry about like 900ish AC, sure there is a slight difference between 900 and 1000, but if it requires wearing a tree weave... forget it. I'll burn the tree weave before selling it to a warrior, cause I can't stop the heaving when I see them in it. (Well female wood elves look ok in leather, so maybe I can give it to them) So what if you can't tank as well. I haven't ever noticed anything really difficult in this game, it requires very little skill to play. There are only two skill levels... competant and incompetant. In truth, almost never die cause everyone is so worried about their precious yellow bar, they never wanna do anything dangerous. Gimme a call when you hit 60, maybe we can do something fun then. I am not trying to be a jerk, but sitting in a room pulling stuff to a group has become truly boring. Even being the puller has become unchallenging. Exacly when are we gonna stop having to choose between exp, money and fun, 'cause that is what it seems like we do everyday. <br>
