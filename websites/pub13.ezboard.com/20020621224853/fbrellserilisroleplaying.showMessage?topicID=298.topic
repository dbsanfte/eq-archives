He let Vanthalorn to teach but always watched carefully.  It frightened him to think that his pupil’s latent could have been thrown away by such a careless encounter.  She had to learn to defend herself in a style that suited her, not the larger paladin.  The girl was advancing nicely now that they found a weapon style to suit her.  Her small frame and dancer’s ability made her a wonderful fighter and a joy to watch.<br>
<br>
He wondered what direction to take with her training next.  Her music was far beyond what he had expected already and her weapons skills were almost honed to a level that matched his own.  But she needed to learn hand-to-hand fighting since switching from weapons to instruments was not always a choice a bard had.  But all the monks that he had met were as notorious for attracting a ladies eye as most bards.  <br>
<br>
He didn’t want her distracted a broken heart at this point in her training.  It was time to ask the Lady for help.<br>
<br>
Brenton rose from the bench and went into the temple.  He sought out a young attractive woman that had joined the temple when she was just a few years older than the girl and he had talked to her once about her reasons for joining.  He found her in the gardens staring at a rose bud, “Sister Xanthala may I have a moment of your time.”  <br>
<br>
She rose gracefully and smiled at him, “I knew you would be here soon.  I had a dream about you.”  Walking over she embraced him warmly and he felt a rush of desire at her touch.  This was the reason he wanted her to teach his pupil.  She had a fire of passion for life and love that he had not found matched anywhere.  <br>
<br>
He took her hand in his and kissed the palm gently, they had shared a few nights together and if any woman had ever tempted him to settle down, it was she, “It is time that our fledgling learns the ways of love.”<br>
<br>
Xanthala’s face turned serious, “Are you sure you want me talking to her?  You know I have a much different view on love than the most of the world.”<br>
<br>
“She is a young and beautiful woman who will be meeting a lot of men in her travels.  She needs to know the entire truth of love and passion.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “Too many women learn of love the wrong way.  Men who will use her are in abundance in this world.  I would rather she learns that the Lady’s gift is a two edged blade.”<br>
<br>
“As you wish Brenton.” She sighed softly, then turned to look in his eyes, “but maybe you have a lesson for me first.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He smiled and they walked off towards her rooms.<br>
