He had heard the news of Naida's departure just early that day and had not smiled since. Sliding the flask from a pocket in his pack, he took a swig of kromzek whiskey. The warrior glanced at his surroundings. Dirty giants were sweating as they worked hard on constructing some kind of building out a couple hundred yards, while large, oaken trees stretched to the heavens in this area so close to the entrance to Tunare's domain. &quot;I shall miss her dearly,&quot; he thought to himself as he thought back to the last time he had seen the priestess.<br>
<br>
Liono, her beloved ranger, had gathered some Evoluxans to help him protect a coldain crossing the Eastern Wastes and Soul was among the members that had gone to help. Soul didn't care much for the short, frosty ones but he did care for his guild mates and their requests for help, so he had agreed to help as long as he did not harm any giants in the process. (He would turn his eyes when they did so as well) On that day, he killed many RyGorr orcs that had tried to attack the wandering coldain, while the others protected him from the Kromrif and Kromzek troops.<br>
<br>
Soulstomper stopped a moment. &quot;Wait, I never saw the giants help me or even lay a finger on the orcs. At times the way they attacked, it seemed like they were working in unison!&quot; he thought to himself. He stood up from the wall, gathering his packs and slinging them over his shoulder. Marching down the hill towards the closest worker who was several yards from the construction site.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me sir....&quot; His voice trailed off as he saw the mark of the RyGorr on the man's sash. The giant spun around to face him. &quot;Yes, what do you want, you mercenary scum?&quot; The giant looked down upon Soul with such distaste and disrespect, the aged warrior wouldn't stand for it. Unslinging his staff from its holster on his back he charged the giant. Battle raged in the area as two more workers caught sight of the Teir’Dal just as he slew the giant. They roared and dashed towards Soul, yelling curses in an ancient tongue. In a berserker rage, the warrior startled them by yelling back at them, “The allies of the RyGorr are no allies of mine!”, and darting head out into them, his staff swinging in a fury. Moments later, Soul stood over the three slain giants, the battle had been fierce but he had prevailed.<br>
<br>
Bloody and bruised, he held himself up using his staff as a makeshift crutch. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Deeeeeerrrroooooo Deeeeeerrrroooooo </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->The perimeter alarm of the city blared across the Wakening Lands. The city knew of his actions and guards would be there any moment to kill him. He quickly drank the vial of murky liquid that Jelen had given him to ‘Use if your ever stuck and need to disappear quick’ where the great shaman’s words. The warrior felt a warm feeling across him as the fluid ran down his throat. His eyes closed and he drifted to sleep.<br>
<br>
When he awoke he was in the center of a dry desert, which after looking around appeared to be the Field of Bone outside Cabilis. Groggily he tried to stand, finding that his wounds were still there, only numbed by the serenity of sleep. Retrieving the bandages and ointments from his pack he began to dress his wounds. While doing so, he could think but one thing…….<br>
