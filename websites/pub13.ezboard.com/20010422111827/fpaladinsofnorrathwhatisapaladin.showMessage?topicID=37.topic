All together that makes 78 levels of playing &quot;the Holy Knight&quot; class, which I love so much.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I am not going to spew off all sorts of percentages and data pool information and hypotheses on stats, blah blah blah... this post is simply to share viewpoints on what *exactly* the paladin class is meant to do in the game of Everquest.  I might discuss stats, but not in any great detail.<br>
<br>
On to the analysis, shall we?  I will list the individual roles of the Paladin and make a comment on them each in turn.<br>
<br>
The Warrior Role<br>
<br>
This is perhaps the most common role the paladin takes on in Norrath.  Dealing damage, and aborbing damage is the mainstay to the warrior aspect.  <br>
<br>
While paladins do NOT (I hate to admit it, but no, we are not effective damage dealers compared to monks, rogues, warriors--about equal with rangers and shadowknights) deal massive amounts of melee damage, we are only second to the warrior in tanking (the art of having your body be used as a &quot;meat shield&quot;).  <br>
<br>
A paladin becomes even more of a tank when they subscribe to the current mode of thinking amongst my fellow knights, by doing away with stats (for the most part) and pumping up on armour class and hit points.  While I agree that AC is important (traded in my Mithril breastplate for a Enamelled black one) I for one, will not give up strength for a few more armour class.  My reasons for this are simple:  Paladins are not meant to be primary tanks.  If there is ony one tank in the group and it's a paladin, it's not a good group; there should be at least another hybrid (to share tanking) or a warrior (to do mostly all the tanking).  And no, monks are NOT tanks.  Melee does not equal tank.<br>
<br>
This is why I won't give up my strength for a whole bunch of hit points or AC.  My melee abilities are already hampered by being a hybrid, I'm not going to make it worse by not having high strength to make up for less skill in 1hs or 2hs (compared to a warrior).  Granted, if I can trade in stat gear for AC gear I will: ONLY if it is a stat other than STR, to a lesser extent DEX (I still use my ghoulbane) and an even lesser extent WIS.  Hence, the mithril bp went bye bye.<br>
<br>
I am currently on the market for a Hero bracer (10 str, 9 AC *drool*) a Lava pendant, and a hooded black cloak.  These will help my AC and give me the beloved STR I need.<br>
<br>
I digress.<br>
<br>
So, the paladin in pure melee mode can be thought of like this.  He or she picks up the slack of tanking for the primary tank, or shares it with a hybrid.  Offensively, the paladin is there to do some helpful damage.  Defensively, the paladin is almost forced (in lower and mid-levels) to use 1hs and bash and by using bash to interrupt spells saves everyone some grief.<br>
<br>
The Cleric's (healer's) Assistant Role<br>
<br>
There are several differnt thoughts in this role.  Firstly, while in melee combat the paladin can serve the cleric in the group by *negating* damage.  This is NOT tanking (absorbing damage).  How does a paladin do this?  One word: Stun.  The stun spell, aside from Greater Heal, is the best one we have.  How does stun negate damage, therefor help the cleric?  If the target can't move, it can't hit you, thereby there is less slashed muscle, less hacked bone, less plagued bites to heal on the cleric's part.  <br>
<br>
The stun spell is also *very* mana efficient.  Some cleric healing spells aren't AS efficient as stun, in that if you aren't even getting hit, he doesn't have to use as much mana.  Using less mana for the cleric can mean the difference between life and death, or the difference between 2 bubbles of exp or 4 bubbles of exp.  Hint: more mana on cleric's part, the more the tank can pull, the more exp you get.  <br>
<br>
Not only is stun useful to save the cleric mana, it is great against casting mobs: saving your stuns for the beginning of a mob's spell casting and you interrupt (as long as it isn't resisted) which can save your monk from having the dreaded &quot;slow&quot; debuff, or you from a nasty DoT.<br>
<br>
Another way the paladin helps the cleric (healer) is by picking up after combat heals.  This only really happens 39+ because the level 30 &quot;healing&quot; spell sucks and isn't really worth the effort, generally.  If the healer doesn't have to worry about healing up a fighter that last 1.5 bub of hp, and can sit, relax, med for more mana (for more pulls i.e. more exp) then everyone is happy.  The paladin is not an effective enough healer to heal during combat, so saving the cleric some mana after is appreciated by most clerics.<br>
<br>
The third way the paladin helps the healer is by buffing.  The ac, hp and ac/hp buffs paladins get are no where near as good as a cleric's, or even a druid's skin series of buffs.  With sometimes 3+ tanks to heal, the cleric is almost always LOM.  This is even worse when the only healer is a druid or shaman.  No offence to all the druids and shamans out there *grin*.  <br>
<br>
I will at least offer to buff the tanks with symbol, if not all the buffs I have.  Think of it this way.  If the cleric has NO mana to buff, then SOME buffs are better than NO buffs, right?  So, picking up buffs are another important way to help the healer.  Don't be cheap with those cat's eye/bloodstone/jaspers; they could mean the difference...<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the cleric's helper role is where the paladin truly shines.  Helping the cleric makes the whole group work more efficently, more safely and with less stress.  This all helps to get what we all want and can't buy: EXP!!<br>
<br>
The Special Skills Role<br>
<br>
This topic discusses the Lay on Hands skill and the other various things paladins do, i.e. anti-undead spells.  <br>
<br>
LoH<br>
<br>
This skill is the best special skill in the game, at par with perhaps feign death and mend.  It saves someone's life (most often NOT my own) and creates bonds with other players.  When you have loh someone and then consequently died yourself, you have made an ally for life.  Most people truly appreciate that sacrifice you have made.  Hording it all to yourself is the mark of a very poor paladin, in and out of roleplaying.  Given you CAN use it on other people, that, imho means you DO use it on other people.  Most notably, the cleric or enchanter.  Saving either one of those means you might save the whole group, even if you might die in the process.  Saving 5 is better than saving 1.  Only 1 ressurect to do?  Ahh, well that means you can get going again quickly and get MORE exp faster!  And LOH is not meant to be used to solo the occasionaly red.  It is for emergencies only.  <br>
<br>
Anti-Undead<br>
<br>
When I'm in lower guk,  I use my expulse undead constatly.  Having that offensive DD spell in lower guk makes you a definite asset on the dead side.<br>
<br>
Well, I think I have explained my view of the Paladin.  To sum up the theme of my &quot;editorial&quot; I will share an exchange I had in Guk once.<br>
<br>
I was OOM *as usual* and was /ooc'ing for a clarity.  <br>
<br>
Then some guy says &quot;hehe, you're a paladin, what do you need clarity for?&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply &quot;uhh, anti-undead? greater heal? buffs? they ALL require mana, FYI&quot;  <br>
<br>
Then some other guy says, in my defense, &quot;someone doesn't know how to play a paladin huh Faz?&quot;  <br>
<br>
His point?  Paladins have useful spells, and if you aren't OOM (or at least using your mana) you aren't pulling your weight, or honouring the class you chose.  USE YOUR MANA!  If you want to hack and slash and be a meat shield, choose a warrior.  If you wanna be a complex mixture of a fighter and a healer's assistant, choose a paladin.<br>
