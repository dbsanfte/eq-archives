<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sat alone on the bench, watching the movement of the city.  Malak often liked to indulge in the simple pleasures of his life, and one of those was to just sit outside the pub and drunk his mead, slowly and with careful consideration to spillage.  It was an art form to drink out of the wooden steins without spilling beer all over yourself, but Malak had had a lot of practice.  So, here he sat, Cleric of Brell, Champion of Underfoot, Destroyer of Goblins and Killer of the Great Troll of Esgaroth Valley.  He was a great healer in his time, and he was a greater adventurer, having travelled the land from one side to the other, and even venturing to the other planes of existence.  He was also troubled, for he was not getting any younger, despite all his achievments.  He was feeling the younger clerics pull ahead of him, both in skill and power, and besides all that, the age in his bones was making him tired.  So, having done his deeds and saved lives for more than 300 years, Malak had hung up his mace, pulled up his chair, crawled into a bottle, and pleasently snoozed away the last ten years.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was unfortunate that he was needed again, he mused.  He had enjoyed these years of rest, no worries and no problems beyond those of the local populace.  He was paid for blessing the soldiers in the militia, curing the minor ails of the farmers, occasionally traveling to Greater Faydark or Steamfont to visit a sick child or bedridden elder.  All in all, his life was quite enjoyable, and that’s why he was so dismayed to hear the recent news.  D’Jarvok had escaped from his prison in Highpass Hold, after more than 30 years.  Malak still bore the scars of the last time he had met D’Jarvok, when he had loosed the minions of Unrest on the surrounding countryside.  In order to escape capture, he had then proceeded to break the hold of the skeletons of the Chessboard, allowing them to run through Butcherblock slaughtering the young adventurers that hunted there.  D’Jarvok presided over all of this with a keen and evil eye.  He had been sent over from Nektulos by his brothers to cause havoc and mayhem, allowing them the time to take over the outposts in the Lesser Faydark.  He had done this without question, as only a true soldier of a cause desperate for progress can.  The Dark Elves had been launching attacks on the surrounding countryside for years from Mistmoore, but with a foothold in Lesser Faydark, they were able to step up their raids, travelling as far as the gates of Kaladim and the steps of Ak’Anon.  Travellers were no longer safe on the roads at night, and it had all been due to the actions of D’Jarvok.  Malak remembered he had promised to come back, but he had also thought it to be an empty promise, D’Jarvok would never see the light of day again.  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp All of this was of course hollow wishing, because D’Jarvok had escaped in the end, killing 12 while doing so.  He was now hiding somewhere in Kithicor, uniting the undead in what can only be another bid for destruction.  The only question was, what would he attack?  Freeport was near there, so were the citizenry of the Commons, both East and West.  Rivervale was also hardly a long trek away, and the deputies and citizens of that fair town had not had to defend against an invasion for many years.  The real problem was that D’Jarvok might not be preparing an invasion at all.  What would they do if they prepared for an attack on Freeport or Rivervale, only to find he had somehow slipped by and attacked Qeynos, or even his old prison of Highpass.  He certainly had the oily charm to unite the Orcs and Gnolls against the soldiers of Highpass, and if that fort fell, then all of the Karana’s were in jeopardy.  So many questions, so little time to answer them.  Malak had received word to board the earliest vessel to the mainland, and he had been on it, reluctantly.  His old armor had been in the closet for quite a while, and it didn’t fit him real well anymore.  His mace was the only thing that felt familiar in his hand, the reassuring weight a deep comfort for him.  He feared D’Jarvok, he knew that.  He had always been able to conquer his own fear, even in battle, but D’Jarvok was different.  If he was out, and if he had enough time, Malak had no doubt that the madman would be able to mount a big enough assault on any city he wanted to, and conquer it.  The fall of one city could lead to the fall of all the cities on the mainland, and without the mainland, Feydwer and Odus would be cut off from the other races.  Noone seemed to think of him as this big a threat, but Malak had to convince the others of the level of this threat.  D’Jarvok was evil, he was methodical, he was ruthless, but most of all, he was patient.  Malak had no doubt that he would stay underground for years if that was what it took, but he would be back eventually.  It was only a matter of time before the evil of D’Jarvok was loosed upon Norrath once more.<br>
<br>
 - Chapter 2 -<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eyes glinting red in the firelight, D’Jarvok stood in the center of the glowing circle he had drawn on the ground.  He had been preparing for this moment for more than 30 years, and now that it was finally at hand, he could hardly contain his excitement.  The golems stood near the walls of the chamber, large and impassive in the spectacle.  D’Jarvok stood with his head bowed, the light dancing on the walls and on his robes, causing the shadows to swim across the ancient rock.  Suddenly, with some predetermined signal from the Gods above, D’Jarvok raised his hands and began to chant.  The fire turned blue, and runes began to glow a weak red on the floor.  The Golem’s eyes began to glow, lending even more light to the scene.  Soon the fire was green, and the runes on the floor were a deep, blood red.  With the final word of the spell uttered, D’Jarvok took his dagger from his belt, sliced open his hand to the bone, and let the dark bile seep to the floor.  The wound closed in seconds, and the pool of blood formed itself into a perfect circle in the firelight.  First one tendril, then another, then another reached out from the circle towards the fire, and then the whole pool was moving, slowly, as if first learning to walk, toward the blaze in the center of the room.  Everytime the pool passed one of the runes on the floor, it flashed an evil purple and was extinguished, until finally it reached the fire, and crawled inside.  It too, flashed a brief, brilliant purple, and was extinguished with an audible, whoomph.  D’Jarvok’s eyes, as used to the dark as a bird is to flight, saw the creature move in the center of the extinguished fire, and smiled. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Malak stepped off of the boat into the life and bustle of the city.  His voyage had been long, and all he wanted was to find the closest inn and get some sleep, but he knew he had to meet his friends at the dock bar in an hour, so he only had time to get a few supplies.  Walking through the city, Malak marvelled at how many more humans there seemed to be in recent years.  He could remember back to the days when they huddled in their cities, afraid to go out at night for fear of the creatures that crawled and scampered across the desert and fields.  They had of course gotten over this fear, and are now coming into their own as a race of Norrath.  Not nearly as long lived as the other races, they made up for it with their zest for living, their ability to concentrate on the here and now, instead of the far flung future.  He hoped that the humans of this city were prepared to fight for their homes, when and if D’Jarvok decided to attack here.  <br>
<br>
“Malak Silverstaff, you old bearded midget, where have you been all these years?!?”  Malak knew that voice, how could he not?  “Cervantes, you tree hugging, hairy footed son of a scarecrow, I have been at your house while you were out tending the fields, where else would I be?”, and with that, he embraced his friend from so many years ago.  Cervantes the Druid, a Halfling of higher stature there never was.  “Have you heard the news?” Cervantes asked with a cast down eye.  “Aye, I heard all the way o’er in Butcherblock.  Has he shown his face yet?”  “Noone has seen hide nor hair on his head unfortunatly, or we would have put him out of his misery.  We know that he fled to Kithicor when he escaped from Highpass, and that the undead there are most likely more than happy to give him shelter.  It could be a dark day if he organizes them and looses them on the countryside.”  Malak nodded and asked about Geryon.  “He has been fine these years, still fighting with the frogloks in Catacombs of Guk.  He has always hates those creatures more than others, ever since the Hunter and Forager took the life of his brother” Cervantes said this while scanning the crowd, looking for someone, and spotted him.  “Ahh, there is Asmodeus.  He was the one who called us, he was there when D’Jarvok escaped.  He said that the Inkie had help, and I believe him.  There is no way that bastard could have escaped by himself.  Probably the Orcs and Gnolls, they would do anything to anger the Soldiers of Highpass.”  Malak smiled through the greetings, shaking hands and embracing his old friends, but he was anxious to get under way.  D’Jarvok was not standing on this dock talking with his friends, he was preparing for the coming battle.<br>
<br>
 - Chapter 3 -<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jonathan had had bad luck his entire life.  He used to say “If it wasn’t for bad luck, I wouldn’t have luck at all”, and then slam his beer down and stomp off to his home.  He was poor, he was shabby, but worst of all, he was laughed at.  He hated to be laughed at, by anyone, even his superiors, who had good reason to laugh.  So, when his superiors had told him he had to take these messages to Highpass, Rivervale and Queynos, he had welcomed the task.  He loved to travel, to see the sights, to brave the dangers of night and day, with noone to rely on but himself, he felt truly powerful.  He was only in the 13th rank of his training at the Academy, but that was more than enough to tackle the dangers he would encounter on this trip.  Or, it would have been, if he hadn’t taken the extra risk of travelling Kithicor at night.  For the past few years, the undead in this forest had been killing and maiming travellers, and no amount of magic could expel them from the paths and darkness.  Jonathan wasn’t afraid though, far from it.  He had the knowledge of the paths on his side, he would get through here with little trouble.  Thinking these thoughts, walking with surefootedness, his mind on the dark and not on the sound, he did not miss the bird calls and crickets until he had come upon the stranger.  Sitting in a clearing, fire roasting a small rabbit, the Dark Elf seemed unconcerned with the dangers of the night.  Jonathan wondered if he could camp here with the stranger, for he was suddenly aware of how tired he was.  With hardly a thought to the consenquences, Jonathan walked forward into the firelight.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ho there stranger, I welcome you in the name of the Freeport Militia.  You should not have that fire going here stranger, it is dangerous in these woods at night”, Jonathan kept his eyes on the stranger’s hands while saying this, noticing the rather large dagger at his belt.  He just sat there impassive however, not even looking up at Jonathan.  “Are ye deaf?  Can ye not hear my greeting?”  “I hear you Jonathan, son of Gideon, Warrior of the Militia and Messenger of Freeport.  I can hear you quite well.”  Jonathan could feel the texture of his voice, like wet leather on his skin.  “How do you know who I am?  I demand to know your business here in these woods.  Tell me in the name of the King of Freeport!!” Jonathan nearly yelled, his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword.  “Calm Jonathan, calm, I mean you no harm.  I know who you are because I know many things, and my business here is one of urgent importance to someone very important, you.”  Jonathan dropped his hand, and with a moments hesitation, dropped himeself onto the log across the fire from the Dark Elf, “What business would you have with me stranger?”  The Dark Elf smiled, and through the fire, all Jonathan could see of him were his teeth and his eyes.  “I am here to give you what you want.  Don’t you tire of being laughed at by those who deserve to be beneath you?  Don’t you long for the power to show them who is their superior, who should be in control?”  The dark elf never moved while saying this, seeming to talk with his eyes alone.  “How…how do you know what I want?  Who are you?!?” Jonathan stuttered, starting to feel more tired all the time.  “I am the answer to all your prayers.  Do you want me to help you Jonathan?  Do you want all the power in the world?”, the Dark Elf asked, finally rising from his seat and standing with his hands crossed in front of him, eyes dancing in the firelight.  “Ye…I…Yes I…I want the power…I need the power…plea…Please give me your strength”, his fatigue was weighing on him like a stone, his chin sinking to meet his breastbone.  <br>
<br>
D’Jarvok blinked once, and then the darkness engulfed him.  He could feel the creature moving across his body, slinking itself like a liquid snake, between his fingers, around his arms, legs, chest.  He gathered his concentration, and pointed at the sleeping figure across the firelight.  The darkness travelled up to his shoulder, down his arm, to his fingertip, and launched itself at Jonathan.  The darkness hit him like a hammer to his chest, all breath expelled from his lungs.  He jumped up into the air, hanging a full two feet above the forest floor, eyes flashing a brilliant purple.  Jonathan opened his mouth to scream, but found no air to do so, his mouth only expelling the sickening purple glow that was escaping his eyes.  His body was thrown from side to side, up and down, forward and back, but there was no sound.  When he was finally released and dropped to the ground, he lay in a fetal position for more than 3 hours.  D’Jarvok could wait, had he not waited for years?  He tore the rabbit from the spit above the fire, eating it with his bare hands, the sounds of rending flesh and smell of cooking rabbit attracting the shadow wolves.  D’Jarvok had only to glance in their direction and they would retreat, but not far.  When he had finished his meal, D’Jarvok took his book from his backpack.  Bound in the skin of a High Elf wizard, this book contained all the arcane knowledge that D’Jarvok had collected through 4 lifetimes on this world.  To read from the book for more than a few hours was to risk madness, but D’Jarvok had nothing but time.  He settled back and began to scan the tome, the groans of his new pet echoing off of the trees in the darkness.<br>

Most authors I read books from have such a boring and droll sense of writing, it barely keeps my attention. There is only one author I've ever read a book from, Elise Cunningham (who wrote Daughter of the Drow, Elfsong and Elfshadow).<br>
<br>
Now there are two authors whom I enjoy reading from <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uresomatic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Res O Matic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Templar of Tipsy</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/18/01 6:25:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Malak Silverstaff (Chapters 1-3)</span><hr size=1> You flatter me Fenye.  Your story is much better than mine, the Calm Seas one.  I really liked that much better than this one.<br>

In fact to be totally honest, while writing this, I couldn't help but think it wasn't really that good.  Apparently I was wrong. <p><CENTER><img src="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/041/57/30415793.jpg"> </CENTER>
