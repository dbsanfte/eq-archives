<br>
This game snuck out with no hype whatsoever, in fact its only being sold by Electronics Boutique.  The game is surprisingly good, i played it most of the weekend, and it reminds me alot of a single player mmorpg-style game.  Its first person perspective and they've created a large world to explore.  The interface is unique, and although i didnt like it in the beginning, i've grown to like it after a few hours of using it.  The graphics arent great, but they arent bad either.  Wizardry games all combine technology with magic, so its abit like Arcanum i guess.  The character customizing as far as stats and skills go has a lot of depth.  You can play a ton of races(wolf-like or Half-dragon, etc.) as well as have alot of classes to choose from(Samurai, Ninja, Gadgeteer, Mage, Bard, etc).  You also specialize in certain areas very similar to DAOC skills, and with some classes like a mage, you can cast spells then choose the power at which you'd like to cast.  <br>
<br>
Overall, its a good game, in fact surprisingly very good.  There seems to be abit of hype on the game that i read, since Gamespot recently came out with a flattering review.  Its not the greatest rpg, and going to some of the forums, some of the hype is overrated imo, but it deserves most of it since it came out so low-key.  I'm pretty sure i remember seeing a full shelf of Wizardry 8 the same day i went and picked up DAOC, so its been out for awhile now.  The developers of the game did a great job imo, since i havent experienced any bugs, the world is vast and complex, and the graphics arent bad considering they have never done a 3d game like this before.  As for me saying its like a single-player mmorpg, i think you'll see some similarities when you play it.  It at least reminds me of more like an mmorpg than any other single player rpg i've played.  <br>
<br>
If you can handle a mix between magic and technology(i.e. guns and spells), kinda slow combat, and alot of customizing with your skills and abilities, then i think you'll like Wizardry 8.  I played Wizardry 7 and i think one before that, but they arent even comparable to Wizardry 8.  If you have any questions about it, just ask.  I really like this game, and it deserves more hype.  Its kinda sad that this is supposed to be the last Wizardry due to problems with the company i think, as well as problems with release of thsi game.  I know they intended to continue the series originally since this was their first foray into 3D which turned out great.  They did a great job, and its sad how this game deserve more hype than most rpg's that i've purchased recently but its not getting any.  We'll see how good player word of mouth is, and reviews from places like Gamespot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucolcannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colcannon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/4/01 12:00:16 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleeper Single-player RPG of the year....</span><hr size=1> I totally loved this game :) Very old school and very fun. This is what Ultima IX shoulda been. The fact you can import characters from you previous games is a novelty that doesn't seem to be done quite so often anymore.<br>
<br>
The new class Gadgeteer is really cool and pretty innovative. It's a kind of rogue class that tinkers on the side. You can create items that possess spells (Forcefield Generator = Armour buff) with unlimited charges -- although you pay with stamina instead of Magic points. They can also upgrade their custom weapon - the Omnigun - at various points  to allow different abilities (kill, blind, etc) as well as changing ammo (arrows, darts, etc)<br>
<br>
The game play is VERY addictive as well as being very hard. You have to use strategy to plan out  your encounters and know when it's best to run. <br>
<br>
I highly recommend this to folks who - like me - cut their RPG teeth of games such as Ultima and Wizardry<br>
<br>
Edit: Also, you can go into the options screen an change the combat speed as well as the movement of monsters during their battle turns. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucolcannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colcannon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/4/01 12:02:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukhieran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khieran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/10/01 6:14:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleeper Single-player RPG of the year....</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;it reminds me alot of a single player mmorpg-style game&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Isn't that a contradiction?  :)<br>
<br>
What about the game makes it seem mmorpg-like?  I've never played it but it sounds interesting.<br>
<br>
Also, why is EB the only ones selling it?  Sounds like a monopoly to me :p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utrueheart78.showPublicProfile?language=EN>trueheart78</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/10/01 7:51:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sleeper Single-player RPG of the year....</span><hr size=1> It's like EQ but without all the peeps, nerfs, etc.<br>

I've played alot of single player rpg's and they just differ in game mechanics than alot of mmorpg's.  However, i think Wiz8 is closer to an mmorpg than other rpg's of the past when it comes to the mechanics of the game.  For example, you can cast group buffs which show at the top of the screen.  Then you can cast combat only buffs which show just below the top of the screen.  Its a small similarity, but i really havent played many single player rpg's that really were set up in this group-oriented manner.  Usually, single player rpg's focus on single buffs and its usually spells like bless or some skin type spell for your tanks and what not.  This game has damage shield spells(potions at least, probably at higher lvl spells), damage bonus group spells, group armor spells.  Actually, most of the buff spells are group oriented if not all i think.<br>
<br>
There are many tasks or quests, although they arent really similar to mmorpg's tasks/quests.  They are obviously much more story-oriented since the game is pretty linear although there are more than a few random encounters/quests i believe.  For example(kinda spoiler), i ran into a ratman who is supposedly a random encounter.  He sent me on a task to cash a check for him at the local bank, but when i looked at the check note it said something like 'Sticke'm up, this is a robbery'.  Then i got to kill everybody in the bank although i couldnt pick the lock, it was too tough for my thief.<br>
<br>
Monsters that run in a fight dont dissappear, they'll wander off, and usually you'll run into them again.  The fighting is abit like a console game, at least it just looks like that.  When you hit you see the damage pop up on the monster.  When they get injured you can see them get bloody which i thought was kinda cool.  All of the melee monsters have a tendency to surround you in every combat, and i wouldnt say the AI was great or anything.  I think i read that the monsters you fight generate based on the characters lvls i think.  Some of the fights are very hard, and what seems a easy fight can go from good to bad pretty fast.  Alot of fighting is based on your positioning and Wiz 8 has a unique approach to party positioning that is easy to customize.  <br>
<br>
Probably the biggest thing to like about the game is the customizing.  You have a plethora of races and classes you can choose.  You also get to select the character voices which have probably the best selection of personalities that i've seen in an rpg.  On start up and as you lvl you get stat points and skill pts to distribute.  You get special skills you can start putting pts into if you reach 100 in a stat.  For example, reaching 100 in str gives you something like 'Power swing' or something like that.  Then you can start putting points into that skill.<br>
<br>
There are more than a few things i dont like too much about the game, or other things that could be better.  The graphics arent that great imo, but they arent terrible.  I think Gamespot or whoever said the graphics are on par with a rpg from maybe a year or two ago are right imo.  I wish there were more items in the game even tho there seems to be a decent amount.  You cant see your characters since its all from one view.  I hated this at first, but i got used to it.  You can see the projectiles you throw but you dont see yourself swinging.  Just think of it as a 1st person view where all of your characters(you have 6pc's and can have 2 npc's) have that one view.  It sounds lame i know, but you get used to it.  Its pretty linear as i mentioned earlier, but thats because there is a storyline.  You can wander around and get to the storyline when you want i guess.  <br>
<br>
Overall, i really enjoy this game.  Imo the hype on it is abit over-exxagerated, including Gamespot's review, then again it came out with literally no hype.  I thought it was kinda funny to see just plain paper CD sleeves and a instruction book in the box.  Kinda cheap looking but who cares about packaging?  I made a mistake earlier, it was being sold at only Electronics Boutique for the first month then i believe its supposed to hit the other stores.  I think SirTech lost its publisher at some point during the project.  I'm pretty sure they had other problems as well, i'm not even sure SirTech is still in business.  Whats most impressive is the fact that the game is almost bug-free.  If you liked old school rpgs heavy on customizing, with so-so graphics, and 15 minute battles, then you'll probably like Wiz8.  Its no Baldurs Gate, but its still a great rpg imo, and unique in more than a few ways.  I really would like it to do well considering every game comes out with tons of hype these days but their usually incomplete at release and suck.  Wiz 8 is the opposite, it came out with no hype and is a polished product that is a very enjoyable game.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and one thinig i forgot to add.  Probably the most annoying thing about the game for me has been the fact that you have to wait for every monster to complete his turn which can take a while.  Its alot like Pool of Radiance where monsters turns can really take alot of time and can get annoying after awhile.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showMessage?topicID=1190.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showMessage?topicID=1227.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.emailToFriend?topicID=1223.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.threadControl?topicID=1223.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1223.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1223.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot>General - OT</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
