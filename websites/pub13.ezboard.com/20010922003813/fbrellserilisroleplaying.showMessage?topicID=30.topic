As the morning dew floated in the air a great warmth was in it's path. The speck of dew slamed into a raging wall of fire only to cause a glowing red log to let up a poof of steam from where the dew drop had been. The steam floated up, evaperating quickly causing a burning branch to move slightly to the left breaking in half sending up a berage of glowing sparks to be caught and dispearsed by the breeze. A bright white spark floated away in the breeze, floating from it's infernoie home towards the vast unknown past a bear in pain and agine and a soul trying to mend and calm the bear. As the figure reaches over to the fire he reaches for a hot iron singieing his own hand as the smell of burning flesh permiates the air. The glowing hot rod touches the paw of the bear sealing the wound with the echoing cry of pain from the bear being heard all over the plains. A few minutes later a bandage covered the paw and the bear was asleep on the ground resting. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The soul sitting next to the fire held a long object in his hand. It seemed to bend and flex as if made of very poor craftmanship. Obviously this arrow was not produced by a ranger or any other skilled fletcher as it was to frail to be used by anything less then a hunting bow as it would snap under the pressure of the twin used in good bows. With a quick twist of his wrists the arrow was snapped in two and tossed into the white crackling fire. The wooden shaft burst into flames almost exploding from the intense heat produced by the fire as the tip glowed an earie red then to white and slowly melted away. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The morning sun glowed red on the horizen with the figures of wolfs running in the distance. A short whistle let out by the man had the wolfs running towards him. He knelt down and pet each wolf as if they where mere pets. Licking him and searching for food they layed next to him. As he dished out rabbits to the hungry wolfs, he cleaned up his camp and puts out the fire returning the habbitate to it's original state. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He walked over with his packs attached to him and wakes the bear up so that it won't be left behind as prey for any poachers around. The bear trys to stand up but bellows out in pain of his wound. As the wolfs came over and licked the bear on the face trying to encourage him to stand up the figure reaches down and helps lift the bear upwards. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he lifted the bear upwards a crash of thunder boomed over head. As the lightning flashed everything slowed down to a halt. The world faded away leaving just an empty dark void in his head. Familer faces flash ramdonly before his eyes. People he hadn't thought about in ages after his self isolation. Laughter filled the air as he remembered helping a young female woodelf bard in ButcherBlock. The sounds of joy she brought to whom ever was around her was so great. Then there was the palidens and clerics of various races that celebrated the joy of life with anyone and everyone. The happyiness abounded everywhere as faces came into view he could no longer remember names to as they where distant relics of his past. Romping through the sands of oasis as teenagers out to prove how big and bad they where but yet always staying together never leaving each others side as in a binding of a blood oath. The joys and adventures they shared where enlightning and soulbinding. The love they poured out to everyone around them was so powerful that even Erollisi Marr could be seen around these individuals. Then faces flashed of friends of evil whom would do anything for anyone who hadn't stepped on them or done wrong to their friends. Joy, Happiness, and love of all permiated through these beings as well. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He awoke on the ground with the bear and the wolfs looking and whimpering wondering what had happened to him. He tried to stand up but found he was extremely soar. What was he seeing. Who and/or what was causing these visions... Why must he see them and go through the pain of remember all he tried to forget in his past. He held onto the bear and slowly moved to his feet but as he did he heard another bang of thunder and his memory flashed again. This time he remained concious but felt rain starting to come down around him. The sky broke out into thunder and lightning worse then he had ever seen before. Everything around him was cowering from the approaching storm or was not to be seein at all. The plains where empty as far as the eye could see but yet a storm raged overhead. The bear and the man slowly moved towards a hill side with the wolfs in tow to find some sheltar. Why in all of the god's name was the beautiful morning changing to a massive lightning storm. He took cover under a small groove of tree's and built a tiny fire. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the fire burned it changed colors from the yellow/red fire he was used to, to a weird blue and white. Shruging this off the man layed down next to the bear and the wolfs who had fallen asleep next to the warmth of the fire under the dry trees. As he fell asleep the last things he heard where the crackling of his fire and the rain and lightning around them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What felt like minutes must of been hours as the fire had burned out and the storm had passed. Voices could be heard close by and the wolfs where missing from the camp. Foot steps came closer and shouts men claiming they had killed the biggest wolf could be heard. He staggered to his feet and felt a blow to his head as he staggered forward and fell to the ground. He reached back and felt fresh warm blood ooze onto the back of his head and stood up slowly as his head throbbed. He turned around to see a bunch of men in armor weilding axes, swords, and a few men in robes and cloth with hands flowing and pulsating with magic.  A man in shiny metallic armor stepped forward demanding the man move out of his way, sword in hand as if he was ready to attack something and then one of his companions called out in a language long familer but somewhat forgotten telling him, Jebidia, that he should shot the bear with his bow instead of getting in a fight right off so that his group could all help instead of watching him get beat on tell the beast was back at the group with their comrade possible hurt. With blood still coming out of his head he turned around seeing the bear growling and holding up his hurt paw. The bear was screaming in pain and agony and you could tell he was asking for help in his own way. He turned around and looked at the man with the bow and with slurred speach he said, &quot;You shall ... *cough* ... not hurt my friend back there&quot; The group laughed and the one called Jebidia said, &quot;Move you lunitic, this is our prey and if you have anything to say, you can just run off to another animal and pretend it was your friend 'cause we don't care to listen to you!&quot; With that he pulled the bow taunt and aimed for the bear. All the sudden a boom was heard and the sky broke out into another storm. The men all looked up and commented on how this was truely a bezar day with so many storms. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lightning flashed and he feel to his knees screaming in agony. Jebidia looked down and laughed with his group. A robed wizard in the background pushed forward in front of the group after an intensly bright flash. Rain started to pour down and the thunder became louder then ever. The lightning filled the air constantly causing it to be brighter then day. As the man screemed in agony and terror the wizard looked on in shock. Visions filled his head of a great evil to come. He saw his old friends and companions struck down bleeding. He saw flashes of an evil race stepping onto Antonica and Faydwer killing all, even the woman and childern. He saw his old bard friend trying to escape for her life with tens of these evil beings chasing her. Her armor was dented and ripped up and blood flowed from her face from deep cuts from a dagger. She was falling limp to the ground and trying to pull herself away from them. They stabbed her repeatedly and stripped her of her armor laughing in glee as the bard bleed to death. Then more images of his friends flashed as their bodies washed up on shore broken and bleeding. They where completely lifeless, void of a life he once charrished with them, as if their gods had forsaken them. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lightning continued to flash as the booms from the thunder over head grew louder to the point of almost being deafining. The wizard started to move forward motioning for another in the back to come forward. As a woodelf in the back stepped forward toward the wizard, the wizard was leaning over about to touch the man on his knees in a ball crying in pain. Jebidia looked down and inquired as to why the wizard was bending down and what he was looking for. The wizard turned his head and looked at Jebidia and said, &quot;I thought I saw something of importance. Give me a second m'lord.&quot; With that Jebidia knelt down in his armor sliding the tip of his sword into the muddy ground before him, motioning his fellow men to watch the bear. One of them pulled back on his bow aiming at the bear as the bear roared aloud and started to move towards his friend as the strangers where moving upon him. The thunder boomed louder and he screemed out louder then ever. The visions where intensifying as he saw Kelethin in flames and his once proud people being driven as slaves to this evil. Visions of the mighty High Elf casters being slayin and their Paladins being killed by this new evil. Visions of Qeynos burning as the undead sabers and the paladins united to defend the city. Commander Bayle dead on the ground and Antonius Bayle being whipped like a slave as while as being beatten. Visions of the Qeynos Hills being ran by the gnolls whom had allied with this evil. Cros and Holly lay dead as Surefal Glades is being assulted. The evil outnumbering and overpowering the druids and rangers as while as any others who where about. Druids, Necromancers, Shadow knights, Paladins, Magi of all kinds, Clerics, Warriors, Shaman, Rogues, and Rangers of all races united together against the might of this new evil. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wizard reached down and whiped some of the blood of the mans neck. At the next long flash of lightning the wizard feel backwards in shock, as the woodelf took a staggering step backwords. The wizard turned towards the woodelf with a look of pure shock. The wizard turned to Jebidia and almost in a whisper said, &quot;M'lord, Leave the bear be! I will be back in an instant and have the cleric heal and help him. I have a debt to repay to a old friend whom has helped me. I feel I can now repay his debt partly, if not in full.&quot; With that the wizard begin to chant a spell and the woodelf stepped closer to him as a flash of light surrounded the wizard creating a portal that he and the woodelf walked through. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The storm grew louder and a female human cleric stepped forth and looked at Jebidia with confusion. She asked him what she was to do and Jebidia shrugged knowing not what was going on but instructed her to heal and mend the wounds they had caused. As she got closer to the man he stood up quickly with an intense fire raging in his eyes and yelled up into the air &quot;WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER ANY OF THEM OR SEE THESE IMAGIES!&quot; With that the sky broke out into a deafining roar that caused everyone to cover their ears in pain, except the man who just stood their with a fire blazing in his eyes glaring up at the sky. A member of the party looked around and commented to Jebidia that Karana or Tunare was here teaching this person a lesson. Just then another long thunder roared and the man yelled up into the sky again, &quot;Tunare, Please no more visions... I beg of you Karana to spare my soul this suffering!&quot; Again the sky roared out and he begin to weep as boiling blood came out of his eyes instead of tears. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The cleric pulled her mace out and stepped backwards and Jebidia pulled his swordtip out of the ground and beign to swing his sword around. The man looked down and saw the bear in front of him roaring at the strangers infront of him. He looked about and saw they all had weapons drawn and remembered back to being hit on the head. He glared at them said in a deafly tone, &quot;For your sins against the animals you must pay!&quot; With the last word falling out of his mouth his skin turned a bright red as fire errupted in his hands and eventually envelped his whole body. The small groove around them lighted up as if it was day but was changing color from a dark red to a bright red to a orange then a yellow. The heat from this man was so great that the wet ground dried up and cracked under the intensity of it. Just then another roar was let out in the sky and he yelled looking up into the lightning, &quot;YES TUNARE AND KARANA, I WILL DO YOUR BIDDING ONCE MORE!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He looked back down and closed his eyes as the others stepped back confused. Just then a portal opened up next to him and he opened his firey eyes to turn and look. Out stepped the wizard and his woodelf friend was shortly behind him. The wizard reached out his hands and yelled, &quot;No my friend stop!&quot; as a few other figures started to emrge from the portal. One pushed out of the portal yelling &quot;DAKKAR???&quot; as another stepped out seeing the blood on his face and begin to weave the healing magic he had long since mastered. More poured out of the portal seeing their old friend in the process of casting a spell they drew their weapons and ran towards him looking for his assialent. A few voices he recognized after his years of suclussion. He lowered his hands to his sides and let the fire die down as he turned around towards two dwarfs. His eyes still on fire he looked at them and said in a quite voice, &quot;Mcbash?? Megrunt?? Leylia?? Fumarie?? Dakthek?? Jimwise?? Etherial?? Moz?? Seph?? Is it really you?&quot; And Mcbash holstered his twohand mitheral swords on his back and looked up with as much of a smile a dwarf could muster saying, &quot;Aye lad, Tis us and we damn glad to be seein' ya be ok! Where 'ave ya been? Why did you disappear all the sudden? And what be wrong with your eyes my brother?&quot; Dakkar then looks up towards the heavens noticing the storm had passed and that the people in his visions where standing next to him. Dakkar looked down with the fire in his eyes barely sparking and patted his short friend on the head and said, &quot;All will be told soon my friend, very soon...&quot;<br>
