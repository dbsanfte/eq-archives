<br>
What I see right now:<br>
<br>
1. Too many people on the VS lists.<br>
<br>
2. A lack of adaptability in our system.<br>
<br>
3. Those gulids capable of doing the Gods need to decide if they need/want a scheduling system.<br>
<br>
4. Board Camping.<br>
<br>
5. The Board's Timezone.<br>
<br>
Point by point proposed resolutions:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 1.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This to me deserves a thread by itself. I would propose that at LEAST a VS raid needs 50% of the people signed up for the raid from their own guild. AND they need to provide that when making the reservation. I would make it retroactive, and institute the rule NOW. On VS, I would make him completely immune to any other requirements that say we need to provide slots for Indy's. Since VS is in such high demand, Indy's are not allowed to reserve him. I highly doubt there are even that many Indy's out there capable of leading a raid at this point, and it's silly that we would make exclusions to provide for five people on the server. To prove my point, I would propose that those Indy's who have or think they can or more specifically WILL lead an VS raid, they should respond when we propose to change the rule. (Or here, for that matter.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 2.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I truly believe our system is rather inflexible. Sometimes, we have common sense changes that a MOD changes by fiat. I don't really have a problem with that. However, when we changed the Intentions board, it may have well been done by fiat, since the voting for it was done in such a crackpot way. (Yes, no, maybe, but if not this, than that.) Additionally, if we want to remove some items from reservations, or change the requirements for them, there is no real method for getting this to happen. Basically, at this point, if MODS don't propose a change, it won't happen. That's retarded. No insult to the MODS intended, I'm just stating that that being the only method of change is not solving any of the problems that have occurred. How do we change that? A board topic group has been mentioned several times, with quiet resistance or outright ignoring by the board MODS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Currently, it's only been proven (to my knowledge) that SR and Watchers can even do CT or Inny. I would suspect that Enshadowed is at least very close to that group.  Additionally, to my knowledge it is members of SR and Watchers (probably with members of Enshadowed) who are most inclined to ditch the reservation system altogether. Even though Thorondar initiated the idea of organizing the gods a bit better, I truly believe that SR, Watchers and Enshadowed, by and large have no desire to add any more scheduling to our schedule.<br>
<br>
I have one caveat. Currently, the gods fall underneath the scheduling system already. Change may well be necessary. To me, a simple solution would be to put the gods on another Raid Schedule. Again, I would say only those guilds that CAN do the gods would have the right to vote on how they want to handle it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 4</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Board Camping. This is related in some part to Problem 5, the time zone that the board is in. However, there has to be some method by which reservations are not to the point of being a split second thing at FOUR in the freaking morning.  How to solve this issue? I'd say random off the date. If you really wish a Saturday raid, put your hat in the ring for it, and roll it off. If you don't get that date, you can still attempt to get another date the following week.  Basically something along the lines of what Adune posted several months ago.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Problem 5 </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Board Time zone. I can't stand it. I don't care that it's the same time as the servers. I've never noticed the time on the servers anyway! Who does? Why NOT make the time zone EST. You've got roughly 1/4 of the players on Brell on the East coast. At least another half are going to benefit by having the times posted earlier than that! What PST person wouldn't want to be able to post their raid time at 8pm! A simple vote would take care of the problem. &quot;Which time zone do you want the board to be in: GMT, EST, PST.&quot; A week later, it makes more sense. However, the time zone it's in now is about the worst it can possibly be while living on the East Coast.<br>
<br>
In any case, please post other problems you see, and/or discuss these. If need be, it might be smarter to post them in different topical discussions.<br>

5. If you change the timezone to est then people in europe have to reserve at 5am. Personally I'd rather stay up a bit later and reserve at 3am than get up to reserve at 5am. <p><CENTER>Hethral Kegslayer 52nd level Cleric of Brell</CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 666<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/10/01 12:19:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion - Problems with our Reservation System</span><hr size=1> <br>
I think we need to solve the problem of board camping.  Whatever time you have to post your raid it's still going to be a split second thing of who wins and who loses.  On other servers, namely Bristlebane, they post their desires a week in advance or so and the dates are randomed between the people that wanted them.  I think a system like this would be more fair if the proper checks and balances were built in to curb unintentional abuse.<br>
<br>
The time zone of the board is only importan because of the 12:00:00pst board camping we have going on.  If that was removed I doubt anyone would care what time zone it was set to. <p>Bahd - Level 57 monk<BR>

Perhaps even for other raids as well.  If you're guild can't field a raid, ally with others who also can't.  I'm not sure exactly what guidelines should be set for this, but it's what I believe.<br>
<br>
- Note, that I'm in a fairly small guild of mostly 40-low 50's now, if we were to do VS, chances are we'd ally with at least Quorum Angelus for it, as they are also a small guild of mostly 40-50's.<br>
<br>
2) The mods aren't DM's, they shouldn't have to figure out how we play the game.  I personally think if you want to propose changes to the system, propose them, if you want discussion on it, start a thread.  If people ignore you, pretty much says you've failed.<br>
<br>
3)  As you've said, there's what? 3 guilds that could scrounge up the players to kill Inny / Cazic right now?  In the past it seems that they had a semi-gentleman's agreement on how to handle mobs only those guilds could take... as such, if they can work it out amongst themselves they should.  <br>
<br>
- Personally, since they've all pretty much said &quot;plane armor = rot on our raids&quot; I'd like to see them work it out such that they don't reserve dates for fear / hate, just work with the raiders on a given date to figure out when they can go in and kill Inny / Cazic.  If they want to say SR gets him this week, Watchers the next, Enshadowed after that, I'm fine with it... the only problem is when more guilds have 30+ players over 57 or the ability to have that many players from different guilds available, something that hasn't come up yet.<br>
<br>
4+5) I've yet to see a better system suggested... I'm not too keen on /random, jeez, I hate using it to award items as is, I don't want raid dates being used for it.  But I wouldn't mind seeing the board time changed to EST, unless there's a significant group this hurts as well (Asia / Australia are about 12 hours off right? so it would move them back from noon to 9am-ish, while moving europeans from generally about 6pm to around 3 pm?)<br>

<br>
Personally, I'd like to see a non board system that the guilds can work together on, although we did try this once and it was disregarded and basically disrespected by one of the parties involved.  So until some sort of agreement can be worked out and respected nothing will change. <p><A HREF="http://sr.amiga.tm/" TARGET="_new"><IMG ALT="Silent Redemption Member" BORDER=0 SRC="http://fairblade.sinbad.net/images/SRlogo.gif"></A><BR><BR> Zellis the Conjurer<BR> 59 Conjurer<BR> Silent Redemption<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 2290<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/10/01 2:57:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion - Problems with our Reservation System</span><hr size=1> 1) VS list being that long, I agree it is a problem.  I'm not sure how to solve it other than one thing that was listed awhile ago and that was to force everyone no matter how big or small to double up on the reservations, therefore, cutting them in half.  This would stop all the arguments of who is smaller who is bigger.  I really don't see the negatives of this situation far outweighing the positives.  You can pick this apart but the other ways that have been presented  with levels and percentages of guilds and what constitutes a &quot;supporter&quot;..etc....had way more things to pick apart.<br>
<br>
2) I am for the board topic group with one correction from the past proposal.  We should shoot for people being on it that are from different guilds small and large and an indy or two.  I'm not for 2 people of the same guild sitting on it, this may be the default if the interest isn't there..but it should not be the aim.  With that Stipulation, I think the original proposer should email the mods and get some answer on putting that up for a vote.  On a side note, I much like the new and improved help wanted section.  The posts there seem way more open and friendly than before where it looked like people were just sniping and saying..tough..we have this zone.  I see way more saying..hey come join us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  That is always good for the community.<br>
<br>
3) Since the change of the GODS in POH and POF, I think we need to have a separate understanding or scheduling system.  Maybe it can just be an understanding between the god killing guilds and that they dont' need to sign up for fear or hate and they can just work it out with the raid leader for that day.  Needs to be understood that the raid leader signing up for the date needs to work in the god killing guild.  This may need more structure as more ppl become capable of taking ct on.  But for now and a little while, that isn't happening.  I don't want to see god killing guilds signing up for the planes to give it up because no patch was done, therefore, no god is up...or what have you.  I believe this hurts the system and anyone forced to roll or gets beat out against this date to have it given up due to no god will feel cheated and it breaks the system slowly.<br>
<br>
4) Board camping.  I've thought a lot about this and I'm just not sure of any good way to go about this other than the status quo.  I would rather open it up to a 3 week window instead and try that on a trial basis for 3 months.  This will allow 7 more different raids.  As for rolling on a daily basis, I'm not convinced certain people have really proven to me they can keep the boards separate from their job duty.  If my particular guild lost out alot, I'm willing to bet my support for this system would go down and I'll join the fray of people who want to go FFA..I sometimes wonder if some things are done to push it there in some round about way.  So I'm not ready to move to a rolling system yet unless I knew what mod was doing the rolling.  This is my opinion..don't like it?  /shrug.<br>
<br>
5) Board time zone.  You can always have someone else post.  I know of quite a few people who do this and it has worked for them.  If we don't have friends we can rely upon, I'm not sure how that same person can field the numbers for a full raid of decent people.  There are fights no matter what time we set it at..what is one to do.  Europe and easterners to this day dont' seem to have a problem signing up for raids..some individuals might..but it's not like it is impossible.  We get people from those two regions able to secure dates quite a bit.<br>

We beat this issue to a pulp, and there was no consensus except that the system doesn't work.  You cannot rotate mobs that are in high demand between 30+ entities.  It doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Solution 1 - Force smaller guilds to group together on mobs like Trakanon and Venril.  Force independents to make friends and ally with guilds if they're interested in getting on a raid. If a guild can't field 50% of a raid, they shouldn't be able to claim it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem 2 - See below.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem 3 - Enshadowed has killed Cazic as well.  To my knowledge, only Watchers has killed Innoruuk.  Not many guilds can kill these guys yet, and it's quite possible ever.  They aren't easy by any means.<br>
<br>
Solution 3 - In trying to avoid the feelings of entitlement and rampant camping that are prevalent on these boards, I imagine those three guilds will work something out on their own.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem 4 - As Fear and Hate don't really affect SR, with the exception of the boss mobs, I feel it is my duty to not give a shit about those planes.  In trying to be constructive, however, you could possibly limit each entity to one plane per two week period.  SR can have Hate, Fear, or Sky in any given two weeks.  Same with everyone else.<br>
<br>
Solution 4 - See above.<br>
<br>
<br>
Problem 5 - Moving the board's time zone to EST will only further agravate the camping problems on these boards.  Deal with the quantity of people who feel entitled to their very own Fear or Hate raids, and you've fixed half of the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
SR has 40+ members.  SR reserves ONE resource.<br>
Watchers has 40+ members.  Watchers reserves ONE resource.<br>
Enshadowed has 30+ members.  Enshadowed reserves ONE resource.<br>
<br>
20 independents, running around with their own individual agendas, reserve TWENTY resources.<br>
<br>
That's what's wrong with the system.  I know it.  You know it.  Everyone knows it.  Why is it still this way?<br>
<br>
Because we all pay $10.<br>
<br>
Because, in our infinite wisdom, all of the smaller guilds and independents who didn't like the idea of big guilds hogging everything let their judgement fall to the wayside.  SR was never interested in hogging Fear, Hate, or Sky.  We never bitched about having to share Trakanon with other guilds, provided they could field the numbers and stood a chance of taking him down.<br>
<br>
Because, for every large guild there is on Brell, there's 10 smaller ones that feel entitled to the same things despite their inabilities.  I'm not talking about skills, I'm talking about simple numbers.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter anymore.  The apathy the community feels for more rules and reservations will outweigh any push for change, despite the promise of reform.  Essentially, you're fighting a losing battle Sylvaen. <p>Ganon Stormwynd <BR>

I was looking at it the other day and there really aren't that many Indy's on it.  7 to be exact.  Disallowing Indy's to sign up for the raid isn't really the solution.  There are only 7 on that list right now and removing their names wouldn't make a big difference.  However, I do have an idea.  Keep in mind while you read this idea that I'm a part of a small to mid sized guild with roughly 20 members.<br>
<br>
First, I think you should be able to field 50% of the raid with your own members.  However, if you cannot, say you can only field 25% of the raid.  Surely their are other guilds that can only field 25% of the raid with their own members.  I would propose that at the time you sign up for VS, that you specify how many members you have that are 45+ and able to attend a VS raid.  If you have 50% of the raid, then you don't share the date with anyone.  However, say you only can field 25% of the raid, you go on a list for those that can field 25% or less.  You either find someone to team with from that list or you could be assigned another guild to go with. Personally, I would rather talk in game with who I would like to team up with for this raid.  I'm basing the percentages off of a 5 group raid, 30 raiders total.  Some raids could take more and some could take less, but I think 5 groups is about average for VS.<br>
<br>
Oh, one other thing, I realize that VS is one of those mobs that needs a number of Wizi's to take down, approx 10 to 15 for the average raid crew.  If two guilds that can only field 10 members each from their guilds, they still have plenty of room to bring the necessary wizi's and classes, basing that on an average of 5 groups.  But we all know that some raids take more, some take less.  I'm only using 5 groups as an average.<br>
<br>
BTW, back before Darkgaurd and Merry Band disbanded, these two guilds teamed up to share a rotation spot for VS.  Which, I believe was in the spirit of the rules and not within the letter of the rules.  BTW, two other guilds are on the list right now together in the same manner, Lost Adventurers and Knights Reknown.<br>
<br>
2)  Sometimes things aren't heard or received well by the community that reads the Raid Discussion board.  Read that again... those that read the Raid Discussion board.  There are plenty of people that don't even come here.  On top of all this, the MODS volunteer their time.  Each of them has a career and families they must take care of.  Things will fall through the cracks, there isn't anything that can be done about that.<br>
<br>
3)  Yes, I agree... AR, Watchers and Enshadowed are the only ones that could effectively take down Inny or CT.  I would also like see them not schedule a plane if they don't need the armor, but work it out between themselves and with the raid leader the days the Gods are up.  There is enough scheduling as it is.  There doesn't need to be any more!<br>
<br>
4)  I hate the Board Camping as much as anyone else... trust me here. I would LOVE to nail a weekend date for us Slammers to check out Hate again and explore the 2nd floor.  However, camping the boards for a weekend date is a daunting task.  I also don't see any resolution to this.<br>
<br>
5)  Board Time is set at PST to be in line with the time zone that Verant is in, which is PST.  I don't really like it either.  If I want to camp the boards to nail a date, I have to stay up till 2am my time.  During the week, this can be an impossible task.  Like everyone else, I have to be at work the next day.  Sure, I would like to see the board time changed, but changing it to a time early in the evening could only make the board camping worse!!<br>

<br>
2) The system doesn't have a lot of room for adeptation as it is a pretty sound system to start with and only becomming problematic due to high level server population increases.  Nothing that can be done about that.<br>
<br>
3) I hate to see any changes made to the reservations of Hate and Fear based on Gods being up or not.  I feel fine currently letting Enshadowed, Watchers, and SR work killing gods out amongst themselves.  However, I don't to see bitching and ranting ensue because a raid would like to attempt a God on the night of their Fear Raid when one of these three guilds is sitting in the wings waiting to smack him down.  I know I could put together a good strategy for killing Cazic but it would all depend on having the right number of proper level people who I can trust to do what I say as well as maintain their job without my needing to coach each class.<br>
<br>
4) No way this can be handled unless for instance a mod each day posted something at a time of their desire that a certain day is now reservable.  <br>
<br>
EXAMPLE:  Adune on April 12th at 3:33pm posts that the day of the 27th is now open for reservation.  First come first serve for that date after Adune posts that it is open.  Problem here is that it is too much work for the mods to do.<br>
<br>
5)Timezone should remain as is since it is based off VI's time for the servers. <p><center>

For VS especially; he is easy, anyone who wants to lead can do it for the simple fact that people want to go. I think VS needs his loot table upgraded but I'm guessing that won't happen. If he dropped more greaves then it would make it much easier to share him because fewer and fewer people would feel the need to go kill him. I think the list will remain long at this time or until such time that his loot is no longer desirable.<br>
<br>
  With velious there are a lot more uber mobs to be killed, but VI has made raiding them a pain in the ass. The problem I'm seeing is people don't want to ruin faction with many different areas so they won't do half of areas in velious. I don't think velious mobs will need reservation lists for quite some time (until more people do DN and Zlandicar). <br>
  <br>
   I think it's great that peole continue to talk about the reservation issues that leave cause for concern, but be careful not to expect an answer so quickly. We must remember the game is meant to be long and to ultimately have no end. VI makes loot on uber mobs desirable because it keeps people interested. As long as people are still interested and continue to pay their $10 a month to try and acquire loot from the uber mobs then they've succeeded in keeping people interested. The game is fun but honestly VI wants their $10 a month for many months to come. <br>

Those that don't represent a fair portion of the 53+ community shouldn't get their own VS raid.  Whether it's an Indy, or a guild with 4 people over 53.  However, there's no real pressure to change this, and attempts to make smaller groups work together with each other are seen as &quot;Evil uberguild takeovers.&quot;  We rely on the honor system, but those being honorable are punished with fewer raids.  People have proposed many different things, all of which have been opposed by a large enough portion of the server community.  This is unlikely to change.<br>
<br>
2.   The system we have was made for sharing between 3-8 different groups.  When you put 30 groups into the picture, the system breaks down a little.  I think the server will eventually move to a no scheduling way of doing things.  FG reservations will eventually drop off, with VS possibly being the next one.  Hate/Fear will either change the way they work re: the 2nd floor/gods, or that will eventually fall away too. Nag/Vox/Trak, I'm not sure.  Velious &amp; a good portion of Kunark is not reserved, and yet it seems to work well.  Eventually, FCFS will likely become the norm.<br>
<br>
3. The guilds capable of doing the Gods haven't EVER needed the scheduling.  They've been screwed over on VS already.  The response was to stop adding new mobs/zones to the list of ones schedulable.  Several guilds exist that don't need the scheduling system, but they still abide by it.  They will likely continue to do so, provided unreasonable restrictions aren't placed on them.  (Ie: People saying you can't kill Gods unless you schedule a raid, and then people complaining if guilds reserve a plane, then cancel if the God isn't up.)<br>
<br>
4. Board camping won't change unless we change the way we do signups, or alternatively, lessen the demand on the planes, or increase the capacity of the planes.  You can't exactly lessen the demand.  To increase the capacity, you'd have to let people go in more often, with fewer restrictions, so that mobs can be killed more than once every 24 hours.  There isn't an easy way to get rid of board camping.  A lot of people opposed my idea of allowing anyone signing up in the first 12 hours of a day to roll on the date.  I was willing to do the work, but people didn't like the idea of not being able to camp &amp; get a date.<br>
<br>
5. The board's timezone is completely arbitrary.  It will inconvenience some people, no matter what it's set to.  PST works well, as it matches Verant's time. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udexn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dexn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 428<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/11/01 1:44:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion - Problems with our Reservation Sys</span><hr size=1> To sum up a bit of what I've seen and perhaps counterpoint a few things:<br>
<br>
1. Contrary to previous times, I think we're seeing some consensus (even after only 1 day of this post being up) that changing the VS list would be a &quot;good thing.&quot; Very few people actually say that it doesn't need to be changed, and actually, a good many agree that if you're too small of a guild, then either double up, or you need to provide 50% of the people on the raid.<br>
<br>
I want to repeat: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> After only one day, I can see something of a consensus to change the VS list.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I really think we should push ahead with this idea. It's only predisposed opinions that would dictate that &quot;it will never happen.&quot; How about not making self-fulfilling prophecies <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Btw, I did a little headcount on the VS list. There were 50 entries on the list with VS being a week spawn time. Fifty weeks is obviously unmanagable. Allowing for several server crashes and the like, you're still looking at a 40 week schedule. That's longer than it takes to have a baby - 9 months. It's ridiculous. I went through and looked at the list, and though I've been on the server since the day after it opened.. my wife and I have run five characters up and over 50, and yet, I had heard of less than half the guilds currently signed up for him.<br>
<br>
Of the 50 signups, seven, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SEVEN</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> were Indy's. I just don't see the need. I agree with Ganon. If you can't field 50% of the raid, don't sign up. Last I checked, no two ppl can do VS. In any case, whacking Indy's off the list now would free up almost 2 months of wait time.<br>
<br>
And for the record, I preached about Indy's being kicked off for quite some time. Though I'm guilded now, while I was indy for four months, I had no problem stating that Indy's by themselves should not be able to reserve a raid. People need to try to look at this fairly. <br>
<br>
Damn, I knew I should have started a separate thread for this one topic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. I still think the system lacks adaptability, and I'm beginning to feel that it's because the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> primary users of the system don't believe in it anymore.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Something should be done to restore the faith we all once had for the system.<br>
<br>
3. I believe the easiest method is simply for the guilds who wish to do the gods talk amongst themselves and arrange with the raids that are going up there. I really don't think forcing (asking?) them to reserve the plane is the answer.<br>
<br>
4. Board camping must be fixed. At the very least, I think the VS topic and the Board Camping topic deserve several well thought out discussions, and should then be voted on. Let's FIX these problems. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5. Bahd said it right. We fix the board camping, then who cares about the board time.<br>
<br>
And btw, Ganon, I agree with most of your post. I am to the point where people should be able to field at least 50% just to reserve anything. That would free up a lot of space on the Fear and Hate raids. Of course, I don't think they are that much of a problem.. nothing near where VS is. However, if we DO actually plan for the future, then it wouldn't hurt to institute this rule. Mostly because the 50+ population is growing, and will continue to grow. There's nothing wrong with grouping with another guild to make a particular raid run smoother.<br>
