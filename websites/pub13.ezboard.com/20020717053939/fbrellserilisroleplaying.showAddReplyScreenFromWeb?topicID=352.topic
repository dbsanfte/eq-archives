This has to do with a plotline the Violent Harvest is running within our guild. I still thought to post the story here, for any of you to read, who might like to. I hope you enjoy it.<br>
Zirrix’s Player<br>
<br>
*********************************************************************<br>
General Zirrix sat in the War Room of T’Rhennic Keep and looked over the reports. They detailed the disappearance of Matron Creepiing, Reaper of the Harvest, and leader of his guild. Many officers of the guild had witnessed the event, during one of the Triad’s meetings. It had happened the same way as it had with Vresk. Vresk was the Iksarian Ambassador to the Violent Harvest, a similar position which was to Zirrix being an Imperial representative to the Giants of Kael. However, Vresk was a vested diplomat, with all the privileges and immunities that went along with that position. Zirrix’s place was much less “official”. Zirrix had been at the meeting when the Ambassador had vanished. He remembered the swiftness of it all. The sudden twitching, the horrid stench of rot and disease, the phasing into an ethereal state, then the sudden vanishing into nothingness. Only the lingering smell of decay and death in the air remained behind. It was at a guild meeting some time ago, and certain members had volunteered to investigate the matter and discover the whereabouts of the Iksarian diplomat. Then, the Dark Knight Creepiing has succumbed to the same fate. Such matters where out of the usual sphere of experience for Zirrix.<br>
<br>
He was a Warrior of the Empire, not some damnable Mystic. But, he did  know of the God’s War that raged in the Planes beyond the mortal realm of Norrath. He suspected that these “disappearances” had something to do with that. Still, he was not good with such other worldly happenstance. Standing in his War Room, Zirrix decided that if the situation did not fit his understanding, he would rearrange the facts in a way that did. Rallos can take the other Gods and their servants, this was a question of mortal tactics. Those things he did understand. Strategy, orders of battle, objectives and maneuverings were all first nature to him. Zirrix sat in his command chair and considered the situation in those terms. Knowing what he did of the other God’s ways, he could surmise that the either the God of decay and disease Bertoxxulous, or  some of it’s servants, was responsible in some way. Zirrix also knew that a few races actually worshipped the foul being. He knew the Gnomes served the Rot God, and he believed some Humans did as well. Based on these criteria, it would be most logical to isolate and interrogate any members of those various sub-races that were in Neriak. Zirrix had occasionally seen both Human and Gnome adventurers polluting the Neriak scenery with their presence. So, there were two possible targets. But, there were other concerns as well.<br>
<br>
The noble Houses of Neriak were jealous of their power, and sensitive about their positions. Peace was kept (as much peace could be kept in a society built on constant subterfuge, assassination and House warfare), because all the noble lines balanced each other. Oh, there were Greater and Lesser Houses, and one learned quickly who got the best seats and prettiest whores at the taverns. But overall there was an enforced “lull” in the city, and any open hostility was dealt with swiftly and permanently by the Royal Guards of their Imperial Majesties. Other Houses carefully watched each other, and any sign of transgressing the established “understandings” in Neriak was met with howls of anger in the Imperial Council and increased displays of strength and power in the streets. Zirrix knew this, and wanted to draw neither the attention to his guilds situation, nor cause turmoil in the ruling Council of Nobles. Such problems that the Violent Harvest now experienced was often viewed as a sign of vulnerability. Vulnerability equaled weakness, and weakness equaled destruction and extermination. That the vulnerability may not actually exist did not matter, the appearance was enough to draw unwanted attention. Such was the way of the Empire and the Respected Race, the best way, the only way. Thus was Zirrix’s dilemma twofold. <br>
<br>
First, there were two targets, the Humans and the Gnomes, to deal with. Second, it had to be done without causing undue suspicion or attention. After a time, Zirrix decided to solve the first problem by having House T’Rhennic concentrate upon the Gnomes. Granted, he despised Humans as much as Gnomes, but he held the wrinkled, babbling little vermin of the Gnomish race in just a little deeper contempt and disgust. He would seek an ally from among the other Great Houses to assist him with the Human residue. The second problem required a bit more subterfuge. Calling his aide, Zirrix demanded to known how many “under skilled” troops there currently were within the House Guard. While it was true that House T’Rhennic boasted about the best troops in Neriak, better even then those of the Imperial Guard in some instances, there were still the occasional underachievers who needed to be purged for the good of the rest. Out of all the Guard, there were 7 who were having continual combat skill or discipline problems. Zirrix instructed his aide to gather those 7 into their own “unique” troop. They would begin a new training schedule in 5 days time, to correct their “deficiencies”. Since the new training program will be rigorous and make them dependant upon each other, they are to take 3 days leave, beginning tomorrow eve, and get to know each other. After the military aide left, Zirrix summoned another of his aides, this one not assigned to regular military duties, but part of his “Special Operations” group. <br>
<br>
The orders for this second aide were simple. Secretly follow this new “unique” troop of 7 with the Special Operations group. At an opportune moment, execute them all. Be sure to leave evidence that Gnomes had been involved. Allow the corpses to be found by the city guard, then begin to raise a cry for vengeance. The aide saluted the General and left to fulfill his mission.  Then Zirrix reviewed his plan of attack. After the bodies of his “murdered” soldiers had been found, he would send out his troops to “detain” and “question”  as many Gnomes as they could find. If any other member of the nobility asked questions, he would say this was part of his investigation into finding those responsible for a crime committed against his House. No other noble would dare deny a fellow noble of seeking those who harmed their line for the sake of vengeance. No suspicion would be attached to the actions of House T’Rhennic, and Zirrix may find some answers to his questions. Pouring himself 2 drinks of Kalish (one for himself and the other for an old friend, who no longer hunted in the mortal realm Norrath), he sat back down at his map table. There, he began to consider which other noble line he should confer with to deal with the Human residue problem. He sat, and drank, and thought deep into the next day…               <br>
