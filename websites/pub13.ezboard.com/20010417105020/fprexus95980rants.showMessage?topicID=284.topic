<br>
I'll start with FCFS.  Here we have a few big guilds on Prexus: KTF, Unity, Stasis, Eternus Australis etc.  These are the guilds that are most likely to get the planes, quite simply because they can mobilize faster than a smaller guild who needs to recruit outside help, or an alliance, who will need slightly more time to get everyone together for a raid.  So you have the big guilds dominating the planes at all times, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  as well as</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> all the Kunark big baddies (VS, Trak).  IF you are going to make the planes first come first serve <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> keep the rotation of these guys, then you have just dominated the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  entire</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raid scene.  Doesn't seem to fair to Alliances or guilds that have 20 raid capable people, and just have to find a little more help.  So, little guild raid capable people start thinking: &quot;Hmmm, I could join one of the big guilds&quot; only to be met with sh!t like &quot;Were happy with our &gt;insert class here&lt;&quot; or &quot;We aren't recruiting right now&quot;.  I haven't seen <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  one single night</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> where one of the big guilds hasnt raided <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  something</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Why have all those raids (Kael, Skyshrine, Icewell, Chardok, etc etc etc), and then still be so stingy with the planes too?<br>
I can understand the fact that some of the smaller guilds are abusing the system, but the fact is, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  most aren't</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  In going to FCFS you hurt the alliances, and smaller guilds who aren't abusing the system.  Why hurt so many people, so a few can have the pleasure of raiding every night, which they do anyway?<br>
<br>
Next, FFA.<br>
Good idea.  Id love to see Prexus wind up like Rallos Zek or Brell Serilis (yes I play on both, Prexus was my 5th server).  The planes are perpetually broken.  6 man groups can come up and take whatever they want.  KSing runs rampant, and yet it cant be reported because the guides are not allowed to &quot;assist&quot; in the planes.  You'd just have to suck up losing those MoBs.  Wouldn't it suck if you were killing one and someone KSed you and looted the breastplate you did so want?  FFA isn't very viable, because it loses the whole &quot;raid&quot; aspect.  If you want to go FFA, then by all means do it, but don't bitch when I KS your gorgon/chest/frightfinger/clericofinnoruk/etc.  You did bring it on yourself after all.  And I'd be more than <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  happy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to relieve some people of their planar gear.  I have no respect some people, and I would take immense pleasure in the fact of KSing you, just because I could.  Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I will anyway to make a point, because its not just me.  I can think of alot of people who would join me in doing it, and I would laugh at you and the fact you couldn't do a darn thing about it.  Get my point as to why FFA isn't such a good idea?<br>
<br>
The most viable option so far has been to weed out the guilds who can't field a certain percentage of the raid.  Say average raid is 5 or 6 groups which is 30-36 people.  If a guild can't field over half that (say 16 people, which is 53% of a 30 man raid) then they can't have a calendar ID.  It either makes them grow enough that they can have an ID or they form a formal alliance.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is, most people are not abusing the system, and the big guilds are just chafed the wrong way that have to share.  When you're used to getting your way, then of course you don't like to wait any amount of time for certain things.  You want it now, now, now.  <br>
Some of you I can just picture as little kids, because of the fact you throw temper tantrums when you do not get your way.  I sit back and laugh at the fact you guys flare up at each other for the smallest things.  Try playing on Rallos to level 57, living with crap armor, and not being able to complete quests because people kill you when your camping the quest spawn.  You'd have something to b!tch about then wouldn't you?  As it is, you throw tantrums because you can't raid enough, even though most of you find raids to amuse you each and every night.<br>
<br>
I was told once that I should be a friendly neighbor and have respect for the people I play with.  Well, Im tired of being a friendly neighbor, and my respect for some of you has completely gone into the negatives.  Boy am I glad I didn't post in the Who on this board do you respect thread.  I would of looked like a fool, because a bunch of you right now don't deserve any.  You're acting like little kids and you need to grow up.<br>
<br>
It might not be &quot;just a game&quot; but it is a game.  Its a virtual world, and I think some of you need to go out and get a breath of fresh air.  Catch some sun.  Play <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Real Life</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->(tm) for a change.  Go swimming, horseback-riding, play fetch with your dog.  Some of you seriously need to relax, because you are acting like EQ is all that there is, and if you can't play EQ you don't have a life, and it shows guys.  If you can't act like grown-ups, maybe Verant should just say &quot;Oh you're acting like a two year old, I'll have to cancel your account now&quot;.  If it was based on how you act and not the birth date you posted, alot of you wouldn't have accounts for the fact you're too young by 11 years.  I think I'm pretty clear that some of you are being immature.  I truly hope so, because some of you need a serious wake up call.<br>
<br>
Everyone deserves the right to go to certain zones, and that includes the planes, even the casual gamer.  But people seem to forget that there are types of people who can't join a big guild because they picked a class for fun, and when the time came to go on a raid they weren't needed.  People seem to forget that everyone has feelings and bowling over them isn't nice at all (and some of you have been).  I'll listen to what you have to say, and I'm sure some of you will have a lot to say to me.  If you're one of the people who has a lot to say about how much &quot;You suck and you're wrong&quot; without offering any kind of rebuttal then you're probably one of those people I have no respect for, and I will proudly declare myself <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Champion of the Boards</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> just because I made you angry.<br>
<br>
Im editing this to say: My opinions are just that... MINE.  No one I know has influenced me in anyway, except the people I have an opinion of.  I am not going to sit here and name names, but you probably know who you are, so there!</font><P><center>

<br>
I have experienced this as well somewhat... but only in isolated instances.  Most of the Uberguild members that I have met have been extremely nice and havent been elitest in any way.  But there is one instance that I observed that will forever taint my memory.  I watched the GEBoot camp get wiped out and saw someone zone immediately back in who was in the party.  There was already another group claiming the spawn(it had been like a mintue) and it was comprised of members of an uberguild.  When informed that the spawn was still taken, the group leader said something to the effect of &quot;Dont mess with me I have 3 lvl 60 characters.&quot;  My simple point is WHO CARES? does having better equiptment, several higher lvl characters, or being in an uberguild mean you are more entitled to a spawn then I am?  Pay attention here... this is important... I pay my 10 bucks a month just the same as you do.  If I have a group who is already at a spawn and holding it but got wiped out due to a bad pull that does not give you rights to a spawn(unless of course you send me a tell and I say we arent going back).  If everyone could get along this would be a much more fun game.<br>
<br>
Again, this rant is directed at a specific person, and they know who they are. I have grouped with other people from every uberguild and found that they were all great players and very nice people.  If you wanna flame me thats fine but remember, unless you were that group leader I really was not talking to you.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#F5F5DC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umogguksteinbasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mogguk Steinbasher</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>4/6/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>8:30:53 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://bcn.net/~bruneaum/calvin_evil3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Moving here, sure to be flamed (long)</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I entirely agree with everything Kee has said.

<br>
The... ummm.. giant armor where you have to hunt gems, raise Tormax faction (which is a pain in the butt), and still find the armor drops necessary (in some of the more uber dungeons) before you can get it, maybe leading up to a week or more of questing for just one piece?<br>
<br>
Or was it that uber dorf armor, that isnt really that much better than planar armor (monks excluded of course), in the first place?<br>
<br>
Or was it the Skyshrine armor, where in addition to finding the gems you need, you also gotta kill some 55+ MOBs, that required less effort?<br>
<br>
The only armor that is any better that requires about the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> same amount of effort</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is Plane of Growth.<br>
<br>
Levelwise, it requires less effort to do PoF/PoH tha anything in Velious.<br>
<br>
Of course it could be argued:  If you buy on EBay, theres not much effort to it.  Still... that only works for droppable loot.  I would appreciate clarification to your statement &quot;less effort&quot;.</font><P><center>

Whoever got there first would have rights to said God unless you went FFA.<br>
<br>
The bigger guilds, if they wanted the God, might wind up camping the planes for weeks at a time, just to get the God.  Otherwise the God would be taken down by whomever was up there.<br>
<br>
I was just pissy when I posted the second thing, but it still isn't less effort to get PoG, Thurg, Kael, or Skyshrine armor.  Thethree city armors are time consuming to quest for, having to find three of the correct gems in addition to killing the 50+ MOBs that drop the armor component needed.<br>
<br>
Maybe it will be moot, but alot of the big guilds I've seen/been in have taken over the planes, even after Kunark came out, just because they could.  Rallos Zek is not a pretty sight.  The planes are basically FFA there, with people also PKing whomever they want so they can have rights to a MOB.  Generally once you've been PKed you don't get your body back either unless you bring friends to help you kill whats trained...<br>
<br>
I suppose it doesn't matter to much what I think since I never played past 40 on this server, coupled with the fact I'm leaving the server/game because of some harrassment issues.  I just thought I would state my opinions as I've seen things wind up, and they've only wound up that way because there was no communication.<br>
<br>
When I cancelled my account, I had made it a point to only post on EQ message boards a certain after, and that time is rapidly approaching.  Thats the only reason I stated my opinions on certain topics, because (not only to poke fun at some people) but also to state what I've seen/heard from being around the planes in such a fashion.  There are exceptions to what I've stated and I've seen some of them too, but I thought I should post the worst case scenarios, being that the better cases aren't really too much better.  The better case being the planes are just perma broken and groups only go up there in order to farm equip, and maybe get some experience (pre patch, but its still perma broken).  Gods are still taken by the uber-guilds and they fight over them.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, since my decision to quit, I guess I'll say good-bye now.  Anyone who knew me as Zeena, Taeanye, or Keewee, I say good bye to you, and send you my hugs.  I'll miss all my friends, and I had fun reading and posting here (mostly reading).  See y'all around, maybe in another world, maybe on ICQ or e-mail.  Farewell.</font><P><center>

Here we have a few big guilds on Prexus: KTF, Unity, Stasis, Eternus Australis etc. These are the guilds that are most likely to get the planes, quite simply because they can mobilize faster than a smaller guild who needs to recruit outside help, or an alliance, who will need slightly more time to get everyone together for a raid. <br>

Heh, considering that just about everyone in Keepers has a full set of fear/hate armor rotting in the bank I doubt you will see us wanting Fear/Hate for anything except CT/Inno/Epics. <br>

Time. Yes time is an RL factor that gets in our way sometimes. We can't do PoH, PoF, ToV, kill Vindicator or Dain, Velketor, VS, Trak, Epics, etc all at same time. Many have a family, jobs or go to college. Most of us have been to the old planes long enough to get all our armor from there so I don't see us farming them. The only interesting thing is Cazic Thule and the 2nd floor of PoH. I think the guilds that aren't big enough to do SoV or Kunark mobs that would be more likely to farm the planes, guilds with a majority of lvl46-54 characters.<br>
I realy don't get why some ppl still see KTF, EA, Unity, etc as the big bad wolf. Our goal isn't to get in your way and prevent you of getting loots that none of us needs.<br>

<br>
1. Ignorance - the guilds could act that way and they worry<br>
<br>
2. The posts of a few people who say how they will go FCFS and all the rest.<br>
<br>
Actually the big guilds behave pretty darned well.<br>
<br>
BTW, it goes both ways; there are both people who see all the big guilds as abusing their power and others who see all the small guilds as abusing the calendar.</font><P>Level 59 Conjurer, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>
