<br>
an intelligent person will alternate their items and spells, no matter what root they use.  so if you use spell root, you do not lead off with WD next, because that would be stupid.  instead you would lay on drones, then WD/Boro, then scim if you have it.  with that setup you totally negate any recast time on your spells and allow for continuous casting.<br>
<br>
roots do have a random duration, however a lower level root has a lower AVERAGE duration, which is why we see symbol root breaking most probably in half the time as spell root.  also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.  if you meditate even for 24 seconds you regain all the mana spent on one 56 root plus some extra (counting only meditation mana regen).  besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?  with the warden symbol, you can combine casting and medding with careful timing so that there is no break in either your root OR your meditation.  if you are going to use the symbol for your root, at least do so with a little forethought so that you maximize your mana gain while you minimize your mana expenditure.<br>
<br>
im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.  are you saying that one should stick with the symbol even if items such as the silver charm are available to them?  because thats just silly and shortsighted. <p>-K<br>

<br>
They have a lower maximum duration, for sure, and that translates to a lower average duration.  I will also grant you that the higher level roots have a lower initial chance to resist.  But what is your evidence that, at each tick, the chance to break is higher for the lower level root?<br>
<br>
<b><i>also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.</b></i><br>
<br>
Well technically, you don't need to lose any meditation ticks when you use the item.  Just play the "canni dance" with it.<br>
<br>
<b><i>besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?</b></i><br>
<br>
If you need something to absolutely stay put, that is almost a 100% sure way unless (a) it summons (and even then it will take a while) or (b) you are extremely unlucky and get a long series of resists combined with an early break.  If you wait until it breaks with a regular root, it will have moved by the time you recast.<br>
<br>
<b><i>im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.</b></i><br>
<br>
1) Stats mean diddly on a per-item basis.  They're there mainly to make you feel good about yourself and not feel guilty about the time you just wasted getting them.  You will not notice the difference on even an uber item just because of stats.  Only in the aggregate (over many items) do stats mean anything, and the effect is still subtle.<br>
<br>
2) You will notice effects that are useful, because they affect your gameplay.<br>
<br>
3) Therefore, useful effects make an item far better than a no-effect, stat-laden item. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 10:36:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of the Best: NECK</span><hr size=1> <b>Just play the "canni dance" with it.</b><br>

<br>
effects only make a particular item like the warden symbol better in SOME situations.  to ignore all other situations and continue in the same gear setup as you do in others is ignorant and lazy.  like those people who consider resist gear unneccessary for dragon raiding, you do yourself and your guild/group a disservice when you do not optimize yourself for the situation at hand.<br>
<br>
you go ahead and continue to wear your warden symbol full time.  i will continue to wear my charm and swap in the symbol only when i need it.  i am content with my &quot;pretty stats&quot; and the knowledge that i am optimizing my potential, and living longer too =)<br>

The added resists your gonna get with another neck piece instead of Tunares symbal is negligible in terms of added effectiveness.  The only thing your really getting is personal satisfaction in the numbers of that extra few pts of resist or whatever, which as a whole doesnt mean much.  Nobody really said much about swapping, since i believe Kalinn, your the one who stated that Tunares symbol was garbage for anything but soloing.  Personally, i think it has its uses in groups as well as possibly big mobs, but every druid does different things in groups.  I know my mana tends to go down pretty fast if i'm rooting alot of things, and a mana free version of that would be nice to have.  I also think root durations, until you get the 56 root, arent that far apart.  I'm sure the Tunare symbol root can hold as long as 44 root(whatever its called) on many occasions.

Once again, this neclace is a Godsend for soloing.  I'm sorry to hear Karana worshipers got the short end of the stick.  Maybe you could get a necklace with Invoke Lightning or Gate or something on it.  I know I would be upset if I didn't have access to this item.  Maybe this could be another thread?

On the contrary, debate is what makes this board interesting (for some).  I know I would much rather read detailed pro/con arguments about whether X or Y is better over simple "use X it r0x0r" type posts.  Scirocco's initial post even invites debate, for this reason.  If it worries you that people are challenging your conclusions and assumptions, you could always concede the argument by ignoring it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unuviancaelestis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuvian Caelestis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/bosses/hidonite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 11:51:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff7/faces/caitsith.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Saying the symbol is the best neck for druids is dumb to begin with due to the fact that a ton of druids can't even use it.<br>

Attainable and usable at level 24 for a druid, can't say that for most of the Best of Neck.  Most clickys do not start being usable until much higher(46).  <br>

It is an extra spell slot.  How much would you pay for another slot,,,,me 10K each right now easy.<br>
Sure, it is not an uber raiding item,,,who cares?<br>

It has turned an undoable situation into a doable one more than once for me.<br>
<br>
So, I do think it's quite useful at certain times and am sorry for the lack of a comparable item for karana druids. <br>
<br>
My idea for karana druids would be to give their symbol the low level cleric stun spell.<br>
<br>
The innoruuk symbol gives dark elven clerics and troll shamans the ability to snare mobs, so I dont think that giving newbie cleric stun to karana druids would be too overpowering.<br>
