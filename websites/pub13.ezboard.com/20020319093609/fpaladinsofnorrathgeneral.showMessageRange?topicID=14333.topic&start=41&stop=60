<br>
Frankly I really couldn't care less. If Legends never came along I doubt that we would get any better support anyway, so I don't know what the bitching is about. If it turns out that Legends is a huge success then not only is VI very savvy it may even be better for the rest of us. If it fails then maybe VI will learn something from it. Personally I can only see a win either way, whether they succeed or fail. The worst case scenario is that they totally flop it and EQ dies. Then won't we all be bitching? <br>
<br>
Be happy with what you have got. You will never be satisfied until you learn to be satisfied with what you now have. If VI improves things then all good and well, but I am not gonna let that stop me from having fun, nor am I gonna let it send me mental.<br>
<br>
Just quit it, we've heard the arguments and the bitching, just get over it and play. What is done is done, and it is not like any of us is going to change VI's mind too quick. <br>

I cant understand why people who are this pissed off at a game/company continue to play.<br>
<br>
There have been lots of stuff that has frustrated me at certain times, but I must say I am basically happy with my class now and have enjoyed the game more than it has bothered me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll take a stab at this one.  <br>
<br>
Yes, there is a point where you say &quot;Enough is enough&quot; and leave the game.  However, as any player knows, EQ takes a LOT of time.  It is a serious investment.  I mean, say you take up tennis and there's just one tennis court in the area.  You buy the gear, train and eventually reach a decent level of proficiency.  You enjoy doing it and the owner of the tennis court makes a decent living too.  <br>
<br>
But next thing you know service declines a little.  The courts aren't as nicely kept.  Are you gonna quit playing tennis altogether?  Are you gonna drive way across town to the other court?  A couple weeks later they start charging for parking.  Then a few weeks after that the court fees go up 20%.  <br>
<br>
So what was essentially a mutually beneficial situation now turns into one where the two parties are barely able to tolerate each other.  To me, this is as the old saying goes: Penny wise, pound foolish.<br>
<br>
I have several friends that got into Phantasy Star Online for the Dreamcast and I knew that EQ was the superior game in a lot of ways.  I could have gotten them to try it out and maybe become regular players.  Why didn't I do it?  Because I'm not gonna brag up a game that requires 30+ megs of patches the very first time you load it.  Oh well, Sony loses money.<br>
<br>
But for existing subscribers, there is a lot we like about the game but why, ultimately, do we play?  To have FUN, that's why.  And you know what?  When some Sony/VI jagass keeps screwing with my fun at every opportunity I have less of it than if they would just back off and respect their customers a bit more.<br>
<br>
Am I even going to play Galaxies?  I don't think so.  I have enough invested in my EQ character that I want to see him get to level 60 and see some epic content.  After that, I think I'm done with MMORPGs.  While there are some very compelling reasons to play them, the time investment coupled with the constant hassles is just not as fun for me as playing other online games. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uketherami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kether Am I</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 501<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 2:03:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My EQ Legends Journal....Some info</span><hr size=1> The only part that annoys me regarding the 'Legends' idea is that it is CLEAR that parts of SoL are NOT done.  They were hyped in the months leading up to it but are NOT in the game yet.  The different 'teams' talk is BS.  I have worked in various companies and 'teams' are made and changed on the fly.  I am SURE they did NOT hire all entirely NEW people to make that 'legends' team.  At BEST they moved some experienced people from the live team there and then hired new people to fill out both teams.<br>
<br>
The 'new server' reason is BS.  It won't be 'new' just new to you.  The only playstyle reasons for going over are:<br>
<br>
1. You like the name (dumb, but a reason)<br>
2. To leave your current server (can go to any Server for this)<br>
3. To be a part of the formation of server guild dynamics (like getting in the gorund floor of the power guild)<br>
4. To be amongst other people who are there.  That is elminating the people who aren't willing to pay $40 per month.<br>
5. For the gizmos<br>
6. For the better CS and GM interaction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of the above, 1-3 are very spurious.  Number 4 is elitist (but believe me I do see the attraction to that sometimes).  Number 5 is cute, but isn't cute enough for an extra $360/yr.<br>
So, it comes down to number 6.  There is a problem with number 6, it is HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.<br>
<br>
IF VI can NOT achieve objective standards (new interface, PC merchants) as 'marketed' I can NOT see how people have faith in them to meet their OWN subjective standard for such activity.  Their standard most likely being FAR higher than what VI intends.<br>
<br>
IF the new CS/GM services brought with it NEW, UNIQUE, FUN encounters that presented a dynamic world full of adventure it WOULD be worth $40 for me.  BUT, the truth is I *highly* doubt that would be the case.  Unless they hire a lot of creative and innovative people (= good salaries) I don't see it happening.  Before very long the mechanics of the game will make all the special events seem very formulaic.<br>
<br>
Maybe they can pull it off.  But as long as they can't afford to devote the time necessary to fix core issues with the software I don't see them paying the salaries necessary to reach my idea of an interactive game world.  Old server + orc invasion of FP != my ideal.<br>

I agree fully with Berton and Voronwe. One solution with<br>
the name thing is to keep that name on Legends server<br>

that stupid to just let any idiotic char name get through<br>

Anyhow, as promised I will post more info.  It appears (from other posts I have read) that Stormhammer will be going live on the 22nd.  That is also when the character transfer will take place.  I haven't received any emails from VI so I assume that the registration process was complete.  Stay tuned...<br>

I will offer this one opinion on something that had escaped my notice up til now: items in the game should be named after longtime, loyal players who have made a difference over the years, rather than newbies who choose to pay more money. I definitely agree with that point. <br>

One of the selling point for Legend's Server is better customer service and more dynamic quests. This is equivalent to hiring more full time GMs/guides.<br>

To make all servers like Legend's would most definitely mean a higher running cost, and without charging more for the extra features, VI could be making less money or even losing money and hence going out of business. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utherus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Therus</A> at: 2/8/02 10:52:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udelvean01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delvean01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 3:29:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My EQ Legends Journal....Some info</span><hr size=1> I think a big reason was missed for moving to Legends: annoying little kids won't be able to con their parents into paying for it. Have you been in Loio lately with an alt? Would you pay an additional 30 bucks a month to be rid of the people like you find there? I wouldn't. Its not worth it to me, but to some peope I'm sure it would be.<br>
<br>
Someone asked what things have been promised to us that we haven't gotten or content that *should* be changed to benefit ALL 400,000 PAYING players before spending time making an elite server for 8,000 people.<br>
<br>
1) The bazaar does not work as was promised it would with luclin.<br>
<br>
2) The ability to create different channels for communications in raid does not yet exist as was promised with luclin.<br>
<br>
3) When the game came out, there was 2 types of quests defined in the instructions manual. Static and dynamic. Static quests exist, but over the years dynamic GM quests have pretty much died out.<br>
<br>
4) Act of valor is broken. Holyforge and Fearless are worthless after several AAXP points. All other melee classes have useful disciplines.<br>
<br>
5) LoH as defined in the instructions manual long ago is supposed to be a complete heal. Now AAXP is needed to attain this.<br>
<br>
6) The end game is getting cramped. As some paladins like to point out, there are over 300 people in ToV some nights. Luclin encounters often don't have loot worth killing them for. Their loot or something else needs to be done to relieve some pressure in the end game.<br>
<br>
7) Some people are still having issues with running Luclin or EQ in general since luclins release.<br>

8) Customer service absolutely sucks at times. I seem to recal VI saying they would be redoing their CS department to try to make some improvements some time ago. Anyone notice any improvement?<br>
<br>
The list goes on if you just dig a little.<br>
<br>
The point is that before VI takes manpower to make the legends server, there are a lot of content issues that *should* be adressed first as they affect all of the player base and not just a select few. If the game was working as intended, I would have absolutely no problems with Legends although I would still not join. As it is, I think Legends is a slap in the face to 98% (the amount of people on the regular servers if VI gets its 8000) of VI's player base. <br>
<br>
I can see why some people are pissed by others moving to Legends, because that tells VI that it is OK for them to run it without addressing other problems first. Personally, I see that as the same as paying $12 to get rid of all ads on all EZboards versus donating to get rid of ads on on PoN. People are just looking out for themselves versus looking out for the community.<br>
<br>
As to the issue of giving everyone the same things that legends people will be getting, that can't always be done. Giving the new interface and map system to all live servers would cost VI very little as they already have it all programmed for Legends. It would be relatively simple to make it live for everyone. More dynamic quests  and better CS on the other hand, would cost more money. This is something that they would have to hire more employees for, and that is not free.<br>
<br>
Why don't I just quit if I am dissatisfied with VI? I haven't yet reached the breaking point where I feel it is not worth my 10 clams a month to continue playing. If and when VI does something to cause me to reach that point, I will quit. When enough people do so, VI will realize its mistakes and attempt to correct them. Until then, they will continue trying to maximize their profits and minimize the costs.<br>

But it has one important flaw that a lot have made - you assume that the people working on the Legends server WOULD be working on these other issues if Legends was not around. I would very highly doubt it. Companies as large as VI have different teams for different jobs and it is not very often that they join up except where their respective projects have a common part. In a lot of cases there is a lot of competition between the various teams.<br>
<br>
I would be willing to bet that if the designers, programmers etc. that are working on Legends were not doing so they would not be working on fixing other stuff. More than likely they would either not be employed, or they would be working on the next expansion or something like that. <br>
<br>
VI have said that no person has been taken from fixing problems to working on new development, and I for one believe them. They can't afford to with all their stuff ups so far with SoL. <br>
<br>
BTW, have any of you thought about the logistics of having customer support for 400,000 people at a time when bugs and hardware problems are rampant? I have worked as a CS representative, and let me tell you I am pleased with the job of the CS at VI for what they have had to do and continue to do. In reality, it is not lack of CS, it is lack of proper testing to start with, then CS wouldn't be burdened so much.<br>

A coherant list of things that have been promised and not delivered (more or less).<br>
<br>
The best way for some of that stuff to be adressed would be competition.  There just isnt enough competition in the genre out there.  I havn't tried alot of other online games (Anarchy Online is one, thumbs down here) but obviously if there are this many people out there that are pissed off but still playing, there isnt enough competition.<br>
<br>
One question I have for other people is about Customer Service.  Do people out there use it alot? if so what for.  Maybe I have just been lucky here, but I have never had to call or email customer service in three years and in game I think I have had about 2 dealings with a GM, and one time was to change my last name.  However, I am always seeing people rant about the CS.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, for me personally its not the money or the idea of the server that stops me from joining, its the fact that I am happy with the server I am on.  I have a Guild that I enjoy, and friends I like grouping with.  If the quality on regular servers goes down because of this Legends server, then I will be dissapointed, but that will hurt Verant alot more than me.<br>
<br>
On a side note the thing that pissed me off the most in my eq years was the Thunder of Karana spell.  I know it was over powered, but WTF, can you say test it? and the solution was BS.  I am sure there have been worse things, but that really pissed me off.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, speaking as a Paladin (only class I play)  they have listened ( I think) to many (not all) of our concerns.  ie no experience penalty, better damage from 2h weps, some cool spells post 50, higher defense caps and taunt.<br>
<br>
My personal opnion is that Verant wont just forget about the original servers.  Sounds like they are having a tough time even getting 8,000 people and in terms of dollars 8,000 people times $40 is &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 392,000 times $10.<br>
<br>
And to Keyns weak attemp at flamming, whats up with that?  I wasn't picking on, rather I was trying to see your side of the argument.  If you had made a post similar to Delveans, I would have agreed that you had a lot of valid points.<br>
<br>
&quot;as for a detailed explination on what i meant... you dont deserve that... if you are too lazy to go look it up yourself... or youve only been around since luclin, or maybe youve just had your head in between the outside edges of your screen tryiing to become l33t, and havent EVER payed attention to anything Verant ever said, then i am too lazy to type it all out. I dont document this crap.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fact that you are accusing of trying to become &quot;l33t&quot; is actually funny and my first character was created March 1999 ish.  As for paying attention to what Verant has said, I mentioned in my post that for my first few years of EQ I didnt really read any boards, hence the reason why I was asking people to list some stuff that had been promised.  I guess you can that lazy, but I since people seem to have ideas already, I didnt think it would be that hard to post them.<br>
<br>
&quot;and you are damn right im being vauge, and no, im not gonna explain, and im sorry if that hurts your feelings, go suck your thumb. there is no sense in arguing with me over that... because you keep missing the OTHER point which im so desperatly trying to push forward... &quot;<br>
<br>
So your being vague on purpose, why?  Doesnt hurt my feelings, and again I wasnt even trying to argue with you.  Was trying to see the overall argument from your perspective.  Which is hard when your vague, concrete examples help.  As I seem to be missing your other point, which I apologize for, please just tell me.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I offended you, wasnt trying to pick one person, but you seemed to be the most passionate about the point, just wanted some details.<br>
<br>
Anyways I am not interested but I in getting into an argument with you.  All I was looking for were some examples.<br>

<br>
<br>
1) The bazaar does not work as was promised it would with luclin.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It was not &quot;promised&quot; in the form of a contract.  Verant stated that it was something they wanted to do, that they had intentions of doing.  A company press release saying &quot;we expect our next product to do this&quot; is not a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> promise</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> nor an enforceable contract.  Sometimes they aim for the stars and just end up at the moon.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
2) The ability to create different channels for communications in raid does not yet exist as was promised with luclin.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> See 1 above</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
3) When the game came out, there was 2 types of quests defined in the instructions manual. Static and dynamic. Static quests exist, but over the years dynamic GM quests have pretty much died out.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This makes it very evident that you do not know the first thing about GM events.  True, many GM events are simple lowbie slaughterfests.  But did you ever hear about the &quot;loathsome individuals&quot; in Qeynos?  there was a REAL, DYNAMIC quest there, that was solved on The Safehouse.  Lots of other Dynamic GM Event FED EX quests happen pretty much weekly.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
4) Act of valor is broken. Holyforge and Fearless are worthless after several AAXP points. All other melee classes have useful disciplines.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Every class is bitching and moaning about their worthless Alternate Advancement skills.  Our disciplines are &quot;worthless&quot; but only after <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> several AAXP points</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I can live with that.  No, wait.  I'm DAMN happy with that.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
5) LoH as defined in the instructions manual long ago is supposed to be a complete heal. Now AAXP is needed to attain this.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> There are very good, very sound gameplay reasons for this no longer being the case.  Does the manual for a '67 vette tell you everything about a '02 ZR-1?  No, of course not.  Likewise EverQuest is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> different game from when it was first released (the manual you are quoting is from the first release).  I'm not unhappy about this at all either.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
6) The end game is getting cramped. As some paladins like to point out, there are over 300 people in ToV some nights. Luclin encounters often don't have loot worth killing them for. Their loot or something else needs to be done to relieve some pressure in the end game.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I can't really address this one without a really huge post, so I'm going to skip it.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
7) Some people are still having issues with running Luclin or EQ in general since luclins release.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And these issues are still being worked on, or don't you read patch messages?  Computer problems often aren't as simple as &quot;reinstall these drivers, roll back that program change, increase your memory.&quot;  I fight computer problems all the time at work that make no sense and end up being unresolveable.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Customer service absolutely sucks at times. I seem to recal VI saying they would be redoing their CS department to try to make some improvements some time ago. Anyone notice any improvement?<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I have yet to have a dissatisfactory encounter with a guide or GM in-game, or in the chat server.  Maybe that's because I don't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> expect</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> them to do anything for me, and prefer to solve my own problems inasmuch as is possible?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but I really feel that the entire list above is a set of trivial issues.  In my two years of playing I have never had a problem with the Customer service Verant supplies.  But then, I've always striven to maintain very realistic expectations for what they can and cannot do for me in-game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> However</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I agree that it is tremendously unlikely that there really ARE two &quot;separate teams&quot; for Legends and for the Live servers, and I agree that in the future the Legends servers will be the &quot;premiere&quot; test servers, in essence.  I'd still go there if I could afford it, but there you go.<br>
<br>
I'm also quite sure that the GM's being assigned to the Legends servers are being moved from existing servers;  they are not hiring fresh GM's to plug into the Legends servers.  Legends will probably get all the best and most popular GM's that were ever on any server (Vedan comes to mind), and the Live servers will get new, wet-behind-the-ears GM's to pick up from where the experienced GM's left off.<br>

What I am saying though, is that instead of shooting for the stars again with Legends, they should finish what they told their playerbase they expected to have finished on release. In my eyes, it is bad form for them to continue on with something new when the players are still expecting what they were told to expect 2 months ago.<br>
<br>
3) Yes, I have heard about the loathsome individuals. They used to kill one of my alts a long time ago. But that is what I am saying. Quests like the butcherblock hammer and the like have given way in most part to as you say, &quot;lowbie slaughterfests.&quot; This really isn't a big issue as I find the game to be enjoyable without it.<br>
<br>
4) I sited AoV, holyforge, and fearless as examples because that is what I am familiar with. I wasn't saying that only our class has problems, just that there are AAXP abilities out there that are broken (different than worthless) and also content that is worthless. Why are you happy with worthless content?<br>
<br>
5) I fail to see how LoH as a complete heal naturaly would be overpowering now unless you use AAXP to get it. I wasn't quoting this to say it should be fixed, but more as to show that sometimes VI does promise things that don't come true. I consider writing it in the manual with the early copies of the game is a *contract.*<br>
<br>
6) nothing to add here<br>
<br>
7) I realize some computer problems are really just unsolvable. I agree that there was not much point to this point other than that VI still needs to be working on problems that they created with luclin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  For the most part, my interaction with VI's CS has not been bad. I had a few problems with luclin (AMD-k6 processors and shadowhaven not being compatible) but they cleared that up fairly fast. I died once in ToFS and my corpse disappeared for me. My group could all see it, but I could not drag or loot it. A GM was there in 5 minutes and summoned it to me. But then there was the time I was stuck on one of those little boats in Oasis for over 3 hours. I was just stuck inside of it. Camping, jumping, ducking, levitate... it all did nothing. Was over 3 hours before a GM got around to pulling me out. I've fallen beneath the world and survived the falling damage but had to wait for several hours to be summoned by a GM. I've fallen for 10k dmg upon entering the game and didn't have a corpse anywhere that I could see from it and had to wait several hours to have a GM find my corpse and res me. I agree that I don't expect GM's to do anything for me if I can solve my own problem, but sometimes there are problems that you cannot solve by yourself and wasting a nights playing time waiting for a GM can just really piss you off sometimes.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is that there ARE problems with EQ that I believe should be fixed before Legends. You said yourself that you believe that the seperate teams statement is BS. Some of the examples I stated may not have been all that great, but I was just pulling stuff off the top of my head while I was typing it.<br>
