Nothing has happened. I just am wondering how you guys feel about the subject.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I am an ex-necromancer as many of you know.<br>
I now play a rogue who is of planar lvl.<br>
I have about half of my planar(meaning plane of hate ) armor, and I use one piece(used to use 2).<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is what I have had since the very beginnings of my roguely life which I still use today.<br>
<br>
Mrylokars Helm<br>
Mrylokars bracer x 2<br>
Mrylokars Arms<br>
Kylong greaves<br>
<br>
<br>
This is the woven shadow I am in possession of:<br>
<br>
Woven Shadow Gauntlets ( use them )<br>
Woven Shadow Boots ( Banked )<br>
Woven Shadow Arms ( use them VERY RARELY )<br>
Woven Shadow Helm ( Banked )<br>
Woven shadow bracer ( Banked )<br>
<br>
<br>
Point being, Everything on me right now is planar armor or better except my bp, even though I am not on last piece.<br>
<br>
<br>
If say for instance the greaves dropped, and there were 2 rogues on the raid, would it be acceptable to not roll on the greaves? ethical?  <br>
<br>
<br>
If i won the greaves, which would be banked 99% of the time OR MORE, I would be out of the roll on the next piece ( could be a bp which is the only piece i need ).<br>
<br>
<br>
If i let the other rogue have the greaves and didnt roll, he would have a piece of planar armor, and so would I if my bp dropped later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The bp is the last piece i NEED but it isnt my last piece of woven shadow.  I would hate to take a piece like greaves or another bracer from someone who NEEDS them, but If I get greaves and another bracer, I can win the bp on last piece when it drops.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Three things are of concern to me here:<br>
<br>
<br>
1) I dont see the point of going to hate if i have to roll on items i dont need and therefore am out of the roll on the one item i need.<br>
<br>
2) I would not like to take the greaves or bracer from someone who needed them just so i could have the BP as last piece on the next raid.<br>
<br>
3) I see taking the bracer or legs as the only way of getting out of #1.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Any raid I've run lately I let those in the class work it out.  If they can agree on something I don't even get involved.  Be glad you are a rogue and there aren't but 1 or 2 others on any raid.  Try being a druid/ranger/paladin and having that problem.<br>
<br>
I'm luckily at a point now that even though I'm missing a few pieces I would never use them as I have better in all slots.  I don't have the RE BP but I probably would never use it.  A Iksar Regen BP or Fungi is so much better than having +14 wis for a shaman.  I'd rather have the regen and high AC than 200 Wis.  So I probably wouldn't roll on anything other than the BP and then it would depend on who was there and what gear they had.  If they would use it full time then I would pass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uickhorvonmemnoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ickhor Von Memnoch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnomosexual</span><br>  Posts: 329<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 10:45:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> But is it wrong to not roll on a piece that i dont have? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urahzelr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RahzelR</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 11:42:51 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://rahzelrainmaker.clanpages.com/smallrahzel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> I'm in the same situation...<br>
I got cobalt gauntlets, boots, and vambraces, so I dont care to roll on any of those in indicolite drops.  Why should I roll/win something that I wont use?  Only pieces of Indi I need are bp, legs, bracer, helm.  Once I get 3 of those 4, I personally would consider the last of the 4 my last piece...<br>

<br>
If you have a better piece, you're not obligated to roll on it.  However, if you want to invoke last piece to obtain your armor, you'd better have it all.<br>
<br>
No joke, I could twink a caster with better gear than planar in all but 1 or 2 slots.  That doesn't mean I get to go to the planes, &amp; claim last piece on the carmine robe that drops.<br>
<br>
Unless you have all other pieces of planar, expect a roll on the BP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhalarus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halarus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 11:50:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> Alot of the concept behind the last piece rule is that you should get your knocks in before you get the big items.  It can generally be said that the more raids you go on as that particular character, the more pieces you're going to have.  Thus the last piece rule is basically in place to help the person that has been to hate/fear 5000 times and hasn't seen that one last piece drop yet.  It wasn't really created for twinks who want to be in and out of the planes in 2 raids with only the items they want.  My advise, and it's probably not what you want to hear... take your licks, roll on all the items you dont have yet even if they're goin in your bank, and enjoy the planes with this character.<br>

<br>
Most people have the opinion that you should deprive needy people of their planar armor so you can bank it and never equip it so you can invoke last piece rule on the 1 or maybe 2 items you'd actually equip.<br>
<br>
I think that you should be able to use last piece rule on what you will actually use.<br>
<br>
Forcing someone to get all the crap (yes, it's crap for many of the items compared to alternative items) before they can get the few items they actually went to the planes to get is forcing them to be in place they possibly/maybe/probably don't want to be in.  Why force someone to have to roll on crap when they will be out of future rolls that raid if they win an item they don't want.  It's dumb. <p>=============================

Note that your, last-piece-that-I-actually-want has a definite &quot;at this time&quot; feeling about it, and it reflects your current feeling about your equipment state.  It can't be enforced because anyone can say that this particular piece is the last one they want, and it's not final because they can change their mind at any time in the future and start claiming new and different pieces as their &quot;last ones&quot;.  That's why raid leaders make you demonstrate that you own all the other pieces before they allow you to loot something without contest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujuujuu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Juujuu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 852<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/29/01 4:06:17 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://216.242.60.166/chicktourney_com/larges/415.jpg width=110 height=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> ...and then you actually inspect the other person and see that they have better armor and have no desire at all for the other stuff that drops.

It's NOT a &quot;last piece&quot; for them.  Nor should they be collecting pieces they won't use (over those who would) for the &quot;last piece&quot; idea.  Someone in that position should just be prepared to do their rolling on the pieces they need vs whoever else needs those pieces.  You remember what it was like your first time around in the Planes and going for your armor.  Hell if you'd want to be giving up a BP to someone in mostly Mrylokar for a &quot;last piece&quot; rule.  <br>
<br>
Um, anyway point being, I'd say no rolling on pieces you won't use when someone who would use is involved.  And no invoking &quot;last piece&quot;.  Just roll on the piece you need as normal. <p><a href="http://www.eqforge.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=3209">Sylvarin Foxblade</a>, The Silver Shadow<br>

<br>
I am on a raid, there are... 3 druids at this raid.<br>
<br>
Verm Boots drop.<br>
<br>
Total POS, NONE if us will EVER use them.<br>
<br>
Druid_01 sends tell, and lets them know they don't have the boots.  As does Druid_02.  Third druid sends no tell, and does nothing..  There is a /random 1 2, and Druid_01 wins boots.  <br>
<br>
Next, Verm Legs drop!!  An upgrade for all three druids.  BUT, druid_01 already won something, and only Druid_02 and Druid_03 get to roll.  Now, we have a random 1 2, and Druid_03 won the legs.<br>
<br>
I found out after Druid_03 won the legs, that it was Druid_03's first plane raid, and she infact didn't have any boots, and thus should have rolled on the boots.. All 3 druids, didn't want the boots, and would have rather had the legs, but one of them didn't get to roll on the legs, b/c they won the boots. (while the druid that ended up getting the legs, skipped out on rolling on the boots)<br>
<br>
Was this fair to Druid_01?<br>

If a crap piece drops, &amp; someone wins, good for them.  That's not going to keep them from rolling on a good piece.<br>
<br>
Let's be honest.  Half the pieces are crap for all casters.    Even more so now that Velious is out.<br>
<br>
Juujuu, while I understand, you don't want to go on 40 damn raids just to get a BP, or whatever piece is actually an upgrade for you, you also understand it's not fair to go on 1 raid, claim last piece, &amp; never show up again.  You can work something out with the other paladins on the raids, or simply not roll on any other pieces.  When a bp drops, you roll on it with everyone else.  Some people may have already won pieces, so it may not be a full roll. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utagarth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tagarth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/30/01 5:33:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> Look, if you pass on something, and you dont have it, youre giving it away for free. 2 shaman on a hate raid, shaman 'a' passes on a piece he/she doesn't have, then a bp drops. Second shaman still gets a to roll on bp. Shaman 'a' doesn't get it just because he/she played the drop rotation.<br>

LPR is not applicable to armor gained outside the zone.<br>
<br>
If you want the benefit of LPR, get the pieces. If you have better, expect to roll for what pieces you are trying to squeeze from the plane, on as few raids as possible.<br>
<br>
heck, you might win.<br>
<br>
If you are beyond the point of LPR because you pass on things you don't have, maybe the planes arent for you. You can probably get a better bp anyway. go kill trak or finish velious quests.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uickhorvonmemnoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ickhor Von Memnoch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnomosexual</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/2/01 9:01:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Twinks and planar armor rolls and last piece.</span><hr size=1> I didnt even think about invoking &quot;last piece.&quot; To me that is absurd to do when you dont have all the armor.
