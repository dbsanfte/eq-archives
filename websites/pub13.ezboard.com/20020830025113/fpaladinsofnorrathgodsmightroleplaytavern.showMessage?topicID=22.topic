So I ran around IRC with this name to only find out that I was often confused with a so called &quot;hacker&quot; with the same name. Not wanting any flack over it I decided to rename myself. Nothing came to mind. Well around the same time my life turned upside down. Lost my girlfriend, lost my chance for the college I wanted to go to, missed graduation becuase the school made an oversight on the classes I was supposed to take in order to graduate. So I had to take a full course in summer school. Well needless to say I was a mess. So I decided to take a name that would reflect me. At the time there seemed no way out of Darkness, and well Dark had come from my previous name. So It began with Dark, now with such and endless void of it, I had an eternal damnation I sort of gave to myself. So there you had it Darketernal was my name. Now with this name I went into a chat program called Virtual Places, within a few days I cam across a place called the Kingdom of Gwynedd. It had good people and they roleplayed a bit and it was sort of the thing I was into. So there I was. Now within a few days I had made a name for myself there and people smiled as I came in the room. So I began to have a place again. Now several things happened and Gwynedd fell to be reborn as Virtopia, and its King went from Uther to King Phoenix symbolizing this rebirth. ON this Rebirth I was Knighted and became the very first knight of the Kingdom and took the title of Captain, well after a time I became First Knight and things happened. Bad things mostly. Well as time went on I had to leave for a while and First Knight was taken over by another. When I came back the King Phoenix offered me to be his Hier and Prince to Virtopia as well as his Brother. So there I was Prince Darketernal.  <BR> Now as for Varden. I after a time became more at peace and that Darkness didn't seem so endless anymore. and in fact light showed in me. So I needed a name to reflect this. In the Silmarillion (Tolkien's work on the creation of middle earth and elves and men) there is described a female goddes type figure known as Varda. She was called the mother of the stars or something to that effect. And worshipped highly by the elves. So I thought perfect. I simply took the name and Masculinated it replacing a with the ending en. So there you have it.. Varden.  And that is my name to this day. <BR>  <BR> Prince Varden Darketernal of the Kingdom of Virtopia. Member of the Valor of Virtopia on the Povar server.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Sir Tolecnal duLac</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/00 4:48:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My Paladin's name - Tolecnal</span><hr size=1> One time playing AD&D our GM did a Arthurian legend adventure.

With Lucan running the rest of the town and forsaking his Paladin honor...the Temple was in some amount of danger.  <BR>   <BR> I changed my path from Priesthood to that of a Defender of the Temple.  A Knight of Truth.  <BR>   <BR> Now after all that...I still couldn't come up with a name.  :)  <BR>   <BR> So...After much banging my head against the wall.  I remembered from a Book I once read another estranged lad named &quot;Leldoran Wildantor&quot; (i'm not sure if I spelled his first name right...the last name might be off a little as well).  It was from a book by David Eddings...the kinda funny thing is...that gentleman was more of a ranger type.  <BR>   <BR> As I didn't want to pick a copy of his name.  I decided to go with his Last name as my First name.  <BR>   <BR> I've been very happy about it since.  People usually refer to me as Wild, or Wil now for short.  It has a nice feel to it...and fits the character quite well.  <BR>   <BR> As far as the last name.  <BR>   <BR> After some adventuring about it the world...Wildantor met up with a nice High Elf Wizard at the chessboard in BB.  Since then...they started just hanging around together alot.  <BR>   <BR> Eventually the got enganged.  And we decided to pick the last names together.  <BR>   <BR> I wanted 'Dal somewhere in the name...as 'Dal refers to Elf in Norath.  She came up with the Toran part...  <BR>   <BR> So...Toran'Dal it became.  Which is kinda neat I think...as it sounds like Tore-n...like its torn.  So I'm a Torn Elf...which being Half-Elf...is pretty neat!  And fitting my backstory as well.  <BR>   <BR> Perhaps someday I'll find my parents...maybe even a brother or two.  At this time...I choose not to seek them out.  <BR>   <BR> The Knights of Truth and those in the Temple of Marr are my brothers and sisters now.

After a week of playing upon retail release, my first Paladin (Level 7) was lost down in the depths of Blackburrow, thanks to that stupid tree trap.  I decided to start over with a new character.  (Dador later fell down the darn pit in the middle, and rotted away as well.  That was back in the day when a level 10 was high for the game, and I didn't realize how easy it was to get him out of there.  I ended up fighting fire beetles bare-handed til I got enough money to buy a rusty sword.) <BR>  <BR> I made a new character.  When naming him, I simply used the name generator.  I kept clicking until I came up with something easy to spell and say.  At this point in my EQ gaming career, I had learned that although neat, names like Aaaklmincoih were difficult to type and a pain to remember easily.  I picked Rodcet Nife as my god, thinking that it might have some bearing on my character's ability to heal.   <BR>  <BR> My last name was much more creative.  My girlfriend was not really interested in EQ, but had asked me a few questions about my character to be polite.  At level 20, I told her he needed a last name.  I explained Paladins in general, and described their healing abilities.  She was once a nurse, and picked Caduceus.  She explained it was the symbol of the staff of healing (sort of).  It is usually seen in a doctor's office as the symbol with the 2 snakes.   <BR>  <BR> Plus, it went well with Dador.   <BR>  <BR> This was back in May or so.  Last month I came across the Cleric only mace called the Caduceus of Sacrament.  I emailed Verant asking about who designed, or thought of, this weapon and the story behind it.  After about a week I got back a personal (not cut and  paste) email saying no one knew who thought of this weapon or where the name came from.  Hmm, I still feel cheated. :) <BR>  <BR> Anyway, there's my story.   <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <BR>  <p>Dador Caduceus<BR>Mithaniel Marr Server<BR>Realm of Valor</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uoren.showPublicProfile>Oren</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/6/00 9:50:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How did you get your Paladin name?</span><hr size=1> Heh, Oren is from a movie a saw while I was younger.

And, I happened upon Nokomis - Daughter of the moon.  This is of native american heritage, and I found out later that it is also the name of my mothers first baby doll, that she was given in Oklahoma.  (Not to mention there is also a perfume by the same name.)  It wasn't until I got setup in ICQ that I realized just how popular the name was. <BR>  <BR> As for the last name, I needed something to go with the first, and knowing that at 20 I'd get a last name, I picked it out before I ever created my char.  (without reading the rules on names etc..)  I chose Artemis, so that the full name in meaning would be Daughter of the moon goddess.  Pretty cool hu?  Welp, until you try to submit the surname... hehe <BR>  <BR> After months of playing & finally reaching 20 (and registering the full name on ezboard!) I found that Artemis was banished.  So... I revisited my search to those baby name sites... searching by meaning to find something cool.  I came up with a short list, narrowed it down to Kamali (spirit guide, protector) which matched closest to my reasons for picking Artemis.

I used Etrigan for quite a while, the rhyming demon from the comic books - thankfully prior to the current crop of 'Demon' - the original 4 part series was superb (no i'm not a great comic fan, i just liked the original Demon, k :P). <BR>  <BR> I used this on most online systems as my alias, and various MUDs.  Until I came across EQ.  I found that someone had beaten me to it, and to be honest I am glad they did in many ways. <BR>  <BR> I fell back on the name I used in a long running tabletop RPG campaiugn I have been involved in, Githnaur.  A Paladin of Death, who trotted around slaying undead and suchlike.  The name itself came from scouring through a small tolkein dictionary, and lumping the words for 'gift' and 'death' together, and modifying it so it rolled off the tongue a little easier.  The general idea was supposed to be 'Gift of Death', laying tormented souls to rest etc. <BR>  <BR> On reaching 20th level I knew a surname was the order of the day, but not until 24th level did I finally choose one, when the 'love of Gith's life' got married to another and I no longer wished to leave the surname slot open (I can almost hear the violins now...hehe).   <BR>  <BR> I have heard many calling paladins 'tanks'..and in all honesty I didn't like the tag, correcting people whenever I was grouped that we were not tanks, but holy knights.

During the middle ages, during the rule of Ghangis Khan, the Mongrol armies invaded Eastern Europe. This invasion was lead by one of Ghangis Khans Generals, Subatai. In a battle that was fought in present day Poland, Subatai faced the Tutonic Knights of that age, these knights were the &quot;Tanks&quot; of combat, heavily armoured Calvary, and a tough obstical to their plans of conquest. Subatai concieved a plan to defeat the Europian army and the knights. He sent his calvary forward, after approaching the Tutonic Knights (about 500 strong) and their accompanying infantry, the mongrol calvary turned tail and fled. The Europian army, seeing this appearant retreat followed quickly, the mounted knights leaving their convering infantry in their wake as they chased the fleeing mongrols, as the knights outdistanced their infantry, Subatai sprung the trap, he had his archers engange the knights from the flanks, aiming for their horses, thus dismounting the knights, he then sent in his heavy calvery to finish the knights while the rest of his army dealt with the Europian infantry, who were now scattered and out of formation, he was able to crush the Europians. Although Subatai was not a knight, he was an able leader, creative in strategy and accomplished what was considered impossible at the time, a successful invasion of Europe. Because of those qualities, I chose this name for my Paladin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ukulgankardaan.showPublicProfile>Kulgan Kardaan</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/20/00 8:02:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Many of you may think....</span><hr size=1> Hello all, <BR>     As many of you know, Kulgan is from a book written by Feist. The name belonged to an old wizard/mage. When I rolled Kulgan up, I couldn't think of a name to save my life. I thought hard, and I thought long, and finally I had an image in my head of Kulgan. Kulgan was very prestigious and knowledgable about the inner workings of magic. I thought Kulgan would be fitting for my Paladin as he has some workings in magic, but of the healing nature. Kardaan came from off the top of my head. I wanted something that would flow well and something that wouldn't conform to the rest of the (Please excuse this if you're one of them) DE sounding names like T'Cris D'Underchild etc. When I got level 20 (man that seems like so long ago, and it was) I decided that I wanted a name that would not be hard to forget, and would sound very noble. Kulgan Kardaan sounds just that to me. (Kardaan is pronounced Car-Don) <BR>  <BR> Not much of a story really, but that's how I arrived at my name :) <BR>  <BR> Sir Kulgan Kardaan <BR> Knight of Thunder <BR> Veeshan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uquinnepolaris.showPublicProfile>Quinne Polaris</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/25/00 12:11:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How did you get your Paladin name?</span><hr size=1> Sheesh I wish I could honestly say that my name was come up with more creatively than everyone else's...  <BR>   <BR> Quinne... is actually supposed to be Quinn, but Verant wouldn't let me pick it, so I added the &quot;e&quot;.

Thoroughbred horses.</span><hr size=1> This one will get a chuckle I'm sure. <BR>  <BR> When I named my paladin character, I was looking for something that embodied the the images that the word &quot;paladin&quot; brought into my head. Naturally the horse came to mind, being that it is a paladin's trusted mount. <BR>  <BR> Once horse came into my mind, I couldn't shake the image. It became THE symbol of a paladin to me the more I thought about it. Fast, strong, sleek, handsome, and majestic. A thoroughbred racehorse was the image forming in my mind. <BR>  <BR> Seattle Slew, Secretariat, Man-o-War were names that started swirling around in my head. I knew from the naming conventions that they wouldn't be accepted. Then my memories came to the Triple Crown winner named Affirmed. <BR>  <BR> Now Affirmed sounded like a great paladin name, but doing a little research I found that while Affirmed won the Triple Crown, one horse finished second to him in all three of those races. That horse's name? Why of course it was Alydar. The horse that would have been the Triple Crown winner if there were no Affirmed. <BR>  <BR> So after a little letter manipulation, I came up with the name Alidaar. <BR>  <BR> At level 20, I stayed with the horse theme. Cavonnier wasn't a Triple Crown winner, I think all he ever did was show in one Triple Crown race. It was the only thoroughbred name I could find, however, that fit in as a last name.  <BR>  <BR> Alidaar Cavonnier <BR> Paladin of Tunare <BR> Karana <BR>  <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Rebel Namer</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/29/00 10:00:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Replay's blatant violation of the naming rules</span><hr size=1> We have all seen the latest post on EQ naming rules... and I hope most of us are in agreement that they are a little obsurd.  I have decided that in my protest to the rules, I will target everyone's favorite Paladin, Replay. <BR>  <BR> Sorry, Sir, but your name is in blatant violation of the naming rules.  Your first name is modern and has no place in this fantasy world.  Equally disqualifying is the fact that it is a copyrighted, and trademarked, name.  As for your last name, I find your reference to a real-life religion offensive.  You have no right to have such a last name, just as no one can have the last name &quot;Protestant&quot; or &quot;Catholic&quot;.  I must insist that you immediately change both your first and last names to something of a fantasy nature and non-offensive. <BR>  <BR> I will begin petitioning the GMs immediately.  I would urge anyone who thinks the naming rules are too strict to do the same.  Replay Promisekeeper must change his name.  There should be no special treatment in this world.  All players pay the same fees and play by the same rules.  Two of my characters had to change their names, and so, then, must Replay. <BR>  <BR> Also, Replay, you yourself are a sellout if you do not take one of two actions.  Either change your names or speak out against Verant and it's naming rules.  If you fail to do either, you are nothing but a Verant lacky and a GM butt-kisser. <BR>  <BR> The price you pay for your famed reputation is your responsibility to represent the players who worship you.

(Jeez..was 1980 really THAT long ago?? ack! heh) I always had problems having a name that stuck though. Finally about 4 years ago I joined SlothMUD and was trying to come up with a name. Having always played the paladin, holy knight image, I had to think of something good. Well, I couldn't..hahah. So I started disecting words... I started with A.. Looking for a powerful name Angry came to mine..ok..how to change it...put a hard 'K' sound in there.. Ang..Angrek...hmm...that works.. Well...I ended up really liking the name because of it's originality and began using it everywhere. The reason that I have, and always will keep this name is that one day I popped back onto slothmud for a visit about a year ago and got 2 tells from different people asking me if I was Indonesian.. huh?? Well, as it turns out, Angrek happens to be the Indonesian name for Orchid.. Oohhhh great...a tough holy knight with the name orchid... I laughed so hard, until they said no...it's a good name.. it means noble...valor... and that sealed Angrek's fate... I'm now very proud of the image I've created..heh  As for the last name? heh.. try and find something that sounds good after Angrek...haha...my guild and I tried for weeks (you can IMAGINE some of the comments so I won't repeat them hahah) so I went back to the A's...
