Lets say you were me. Ive never built a computer, much less installed anything in a computer other than some RAM sticks in a Mac at school. Recently, I decided I'd like to get a good computer before i go off to college( as a graduation present) but the computers I've bought in the past just end up pissing me off for 2 years before I end up replacing half the parts and fiddling with stuff i dont know much about till little problems go away. So i happened on this site about building your own computer. It was a very detailed tutorial and after reading through 70% of it, I thought I might be able to do this and save some money.<br>
      I'm a bit iffy since I dont work with computers much and i dont want to waste bunches of money breaking stuff for a computer that wont turn on. So tell me, how easy is it to build your first computer? And would it not be smart to build a good computer your first time around?(good as in AMD 1.7 Ghz 512 mb DDR RAM 128 MB Geforce graphics card, that type thing) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kamino>Kamino</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/25/02 12:30:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15901.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT: How easy is it to build your own computer?</span><hr size=1> Well you have to start sometime right?  :P  To tell you the truth, it's not very hard to build a pc if you know what you're doing.  If you've ever fiddled around inside the case before and know what does what, then i don't think you will have much trouble.<br>
<br>
Just keep in mind that you'll need a case, cpu, motherboard (compatable with the cpu), memory, hard drive, video card &amp; sound card.  Make sure when you get the case that it has a decent power supply of 350w + otherwise you may run into troubles later on.<br>
<br>
Also, check www.pricewatch.com for deals on CPU + mobo combos.  You can usually buy a case that was tested for that combo and buy the other components later.  Hope this has helped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrilin31.showPublicProfile?language=EN>krilin31</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/25/02 12:33:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15901.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://krilin31.homestead.com/files/blow_up.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT: How easy is it to build your own computer?</span><hr size=1> Building your computer is quite easy.  I built mine and it was loads of fun and stuff, but I would not recommend using bleeding edge parts for your first computer.  I had problems with my modem being detected and had to swap it in and out of all of my com ports and had to buy 2 new modems before one worked.  I had 3 DOA hard drives (DON'T EVER BUY A HARD DRIVE FROM SAMSUNG!!!!) and that was a big pain.  This was my first computer so I didn't go whole hog on the parts, I have a site that might help you find the best price and one where you can talk with people who can help you if you run into problems(they helped me out with mine in a couple spots)<br>

There is nothing difficult about the actual steps you take to assemble a computer from the various parts.  The biggest hurdle is probably learning all of the terminology so that you buy parts that are compatible with each other (like the right type of CPU for the motherboard, the right kind of RAM, a case that will fit the motherboard, etc.).<br>
<br>
You also need to be a bit careful with a couple of the steps, like putting the heatsink on the CPU without breaking the CPU, and putting just about everything into the motherboard without frying something with static electricity.  Nothing that hard to do but just things to watch out for.<br>
<br>
The harder and often frustrating part is getting the operating system and device drivers to work.  I've built several computers and that's always been my biggest headache.  The hardware might work fine, but if the Microsoft OS doesn't recognize it right away, it might not start up or the OS installation might fail.  Once the OS does get installed and you can boot it, some of the devices might not work until you get the right drivers installed.<br>
<br>
I've had bad and good experiences with that--I've had W2K not want to install at all, and had to do a lot of hit-and-miss troubleshooting to get through it.  I've also had a pretty smooth sailing effort where I really didn't have any significant problems.<br>
<br>
It's also not that hard to get some defective parts.  I've had defective RAM and video cards before.  The frustrating part is that with some of those core components it may not be easy to tell what is causing the problem.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that if you go into this, go in with the expectation that you will have some of these problems, things won't work right after you're done plugging everything in, and you might need to spend a fair amount of time getting them to work.<br>
<br>
There are also some &quot;middle ground&quot; solutions.  For one of my computers I bought a &quot;bare bones kit&quot;, which included the motherboard, a CPU and heatsink, the RAM.  It wasn't much more expensive than if I bought the parts separately, in fact it might have been cheaper.  It came assembled and tested so I didn't have to mess with that part of it.<br>
<br>
It would also help you a lot if you had a &quot;techie&quot; friend you could call if you have questions or need to be talked through something.  No one is going to give you full technical support for what you're doing, they will only support whatever part(s) you bought from them.  The various manuals that come with the parts will probaby include most of the information you need, but it might be difficult to decipher the first time.<br>
<br>
When I'm on the market for a desktop computer, I usually do look at the brand-name models for comparison, because it would save me the time of putting it together and troubleshooting any problems.  I rarely find a configuration that exactly matches what I want though, and if I do then it is usually a few hundred dollars more than what I would pay building it myself, so I always end up building it myself.<br>
<br>
I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is that it can be very hit or miss.  Depending on what parts you buy and whether or not any of them are defective, you could have a relatively easy or hard time with it.  You'd definitely have some learning to do but it's not insurmountable, like I said it's mostly just learning terminology. <p><BR>

Upgrading a motherboard on a computer with a windows os already installed can quickly turn into a nightmare. But, starting from scratch with a fresh install usually isnt very bad.<br>
<br>
For the most part pluggin/screwing things together is easy. Read your motherboard manual and its usually pretty epclicit on settings. As far as plugging thigns in, usually they can only go in 1 spot, and the motyherboard manual will be explicit on that as well.<br>
<br>
Basically you need to read any warnings/jumper settings first and you shouldnt have many problems. ALWAYS make sure to ground yourself before you touch anything in a computer. A small static charge on yoru skin is plenty to fry a microchip. With that said i have never fryed anything, and ive messed with the guts of computers a lot. All ya gotta do is frequently touch a grounded object and you will be fine. An easy way to do this is to plug in your case when you are putting it together, and just frequently touch the case. WARNING tho, on atx motherboards they are active even when the case is off. You will almost certainly be using an atx board so make sure that you dont plug in the board till last if you are gonna use this method of ensuring a ground.<br>
<br>
Read your motherboard manual on bios settings before you let the system fully boot and make any necessary changes. Anything in the bios that you dont know what it means, dont mess with it.<br>
<br>
After you got it bootable, install your os and get it networkable first. Download the lastest drivers for all your hardware and install them 1 by 1 rebooting each time.<br>
<br>
Baring any funky issues thats it.<br>
<br>
As far as what hardware to use, do some research beforehand. www.tomshardware.com is a good source. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uketherami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kether Am I</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 584<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/25/02 2:23:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15901.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT: How easy is it to build your own computer?</span><hr size=1> There ARE a few pieces of advice I would offer:<br>
<br>
1. Make SURE you are building the computer near a place where you have web access.  No doubt there will be driver updates, installation instructions, bios upgrades, or general technical advise on the web that will aid you.  It is *much* harder to get these things when your only PC is still in pieces ;-).<br>
<br>
2. MOST PC components are easy to install.  These include MB, Ram, power supply, hard drives, cd drives, and floppy drives.  Some can be complicated with either the physical or driver installation, these include video and sound.  MODEMS can be *very* difficult at times to get properly situated.<br>
<br>
3. Get and KEEP ALL support materials and documentation.<br>
<br>
4. DON'T expect fanstastic saving anymore when building your own PC.  The quantity discounts that large PC makers (like Dell) get and the commodity like nature of the final products makes it tough to take much off of their prices.  The exception would be if you have 'free' parts like existing CDRW, DVD drives, Sound/Video cards, or an OS that you are carrying over to your new self-built PC.<br>
<br>
5. DON'T build your own PC just because maker A doesn't build a system with sound X and video Y.  The lack of support for your system more than outweighs a couple FPS or esoteric feature_01.  If this point applies to you it may be worth the cost of simply bying the system and changing one component, giving the now replaced one to a friend.<br>
<br>
6. DON'T make a PC full of every new piece of hardware on the market.  The likely dozens of patches/updates and lingering incompatibilities are a headache waiting to happen.<br>
<br>
7. DON'T do 6 above unless you really don't care about cost either.  In 2-3 years you are going to replace the system anyway.  And by that time the very marginal benefits of the 'best' versus 'very good' would have meant very little, but cost a great deal.<br>
<br>
8. If you do it HAVE FUN but don't put yourself on a 24 hour deadline to have it built.  May take a few days depending on the components, your experience, and available work hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this has helped.<br>
<br>

Apologize if the link above isn't clickable - not a lot of time to edit stuff before I need to walk out the door.<br>
<br>
The guide on this site isn't bad for building a system that will handle everyday tasks and do well in gaming.  I would double the amount of system  RAM they recommend and go with the intel CPU for compatibility on your first PC.  I would also find, borrow, steal, a copy of Windows98 SE as the system's OS.  XP is just crap, period, when it comes to games.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that the prices they list are mostly for OEM components off of Pricewatch.com.  It's your responsibility to do some checking around before ordering anything from the listed sellers.  If you purchase the components in a retail store you will pay a higher price.  You'll also get a better warranty.<br>
<br>
As far as anything else on Sharky Extreme, I think the lead editor is a self-righteous arse who thinks reporting consist of nothing more than his personal opinions.  They also have this attitude that they can recommend hardware that is future proof.  No such thing in the PC industry.  Sharky may have cleaned up his act lately, haven't had a look in awhile.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Alienware, ugh.  Overpriced machines with horrible customer service.  Save yourself the trouble and go to Dell if you want to buy a PC.<br>

I'd eventually get it right, but I'd usually forget which part of the cable you put the Master on and which part you put the Slave on.  My latest motherboard had some really nicely labeled IDE cables that made this part easy.<br>
<br>
Building your own computer is the only way to go if computers and computer gaming is your hobby.  You save a TON of money.  I can build a system that is 2X better than a Dell or Gateway for half the cost.<br>
<br>
Here are some things that I've learned.<br>
<br>
A good video card is crucial to good 3D performance.  Right now I would suggest a card based on the NVidea Geforce 4 4200 with 128 mb of ram.  It seems to be the price/performance leader right now.  Too many Gateways and Dells are sold with obsolete or seriously gimped video cards in systems that sound pretty because they advertise the processor speed, but fall short of being a good gaming computer because a good gaming computer will have a good video card.<br>
<br>
Don't get the latest processor, it carries a price premium because it's new.  Take the price of the chip and divide it by the number of mhz the chip runs at (or the PR Rating).  This works when comparing the same brand of chip mind you.  The AMD XP 1800PR processor chip seems to be the best price right now at $85.  So 85/1800 = 4.72 cents a mhz.  The top of the line AMD XP 2200PR is $220 or 10 cents a mhz.  That's double the price...and that's the price premium.  I'd buy the 1800 chip.  Also, don't buy Intel.  They have been shafting people for a long time and their product is also much more expensive for the same processing power that AMD will give you.  Just because Intel has a faster mhz rating does not mean it's better.<br>
<br>
New processors run hot so a good processor fan is important too.  You don't  have to spend a bunch of money and get a real jazzy processor fan.  My Cooler Master fans were cheap and do the job.  Case cooling is also important.  Cases really need fans now adays.  Enermax, Antec/Cheiftech cases are good ones to get.  I like the big cases personally, but if small is the way to go, get the round IDE cables instead of the ribbon ones.  (ribbon ones usually come with your motheboard, so round IDE cables would have to be ordered extra)  Ribbon ones can block air flow and thus impede case cooling.<br>
<br>
Don't get too hung up on RAM speed.  DDR2100 is fast and is a much better value than the newer faster DDR RAM.  EQ really does run better with more memory.  Go for 512mb in a single stick.  Mushkin tricked me into buying some 'high density' RAM the other day.  I was pleasantly suprised that it works just fine, but there is a difference... although I'm not exactly sure what it is.<br>
<br>
As someone esle said... stay away from the latest to hit the market stuff.  First there is the steep price premium and second they usually don't work right untill the companies get bug report feedback and correct driver issues.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned support.  It is true if you know nothing about computers and you venture down this road without at least a computer geek friend to help you, you could end up shelling out bucks to a local computer shop fixing your stuff and miss out on the cost savings and some of the education of it.  Personally I have my brother to call up and say &quot;my X is doing Y and I've worked for 5 hours trying to figure it out and it still won't work&quot; and occasionally have something obvious pointed out to me.  I can't tell you how many times I've bought a new motherboard and processor and video card and hook them all up reall nice and pretty like and press the power button and get no response.  .  <br>
<br>
Read sites such as www.tomshardware.com and www.anandtech.com  Anandtech even has a book that talks about and tells you how a novice can build their own computer and what is what.  I haven't bought it, so I can't say how good it is, but if it's as good as his site, then it should be a good book.  <br>
<br>
To buy, I use www.pricewatch.com   I end up finding that www.newegg.com usually has the cheapest prices.<br>
<br>
I don't buy barebones kits because they are usually the older items the vendor is trying to get rid of.<br>
<br>
Don't neglect other things that make sitting at your computer a joy.  I use a banquet table from an Office Depot as my desk.  Lots of legroom since I'm a big guy, my legs actually fit underneath it.  A comfortable chair is important.  Logitech mice have always fit my hand well and the optical mice are excellent.  Need the wheel thing too for easy message scrolling in game.  19&quot; moniter is a minimum.<br>
<br>
I suggest putting money aside each month for your next computer upgrade.  To keep with the times, expect to spend $200-600 a year for upgrades.  Put off buying new stuff untill 1) the price has dropped as low as it will go 2) you can't take it anymore.  If you plan to do a whole system upgrade, then save up and buy it all at one time.<br>

Then it just plain sucks and you'll wish you had just called 1-800-BUY-DELL or something.  :)<br>
<br>
However, I'm sure there are plenty of people here who can help you if you have any problems, myself included.<br>
<br>
Important things:<br>
<br>
1.  Don't skimp on your power supply.<br>
2.  Don't skimp on the mother board, and read reviews of them first off.<br>
3.  If you can get motherboard/processor/RAM combos that are pre-tested, it may be a good idea.  I know www.mwave.com does it, and they have good prices.<br>
4.  Be sure you're buying from a reputable place.  People love to use pricewatch.com to check prices, but to be quite honest, some of those vendors seem pretty shady.<br>
5.  Don't skimp on your case.<br>
<br>
Places I've purchased parts from are:<br>
- www.mwave.com<br>
- www.hardwarepro.com<br>
- www.anandtech.com<br>
<br>
Never had any problems with any of these.  Mwave is the best that I've dealt with.<br>

athalon xp 2000+ <br>

512 meg DDR <br>
Gforce 4 64mb<br>
7200rpm 60GB hdd<br>
40x 16x 40x CDRW<br>
dvd <br>
19" monitor<br>
SB live sound<br>
atx case <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
this is the ultimate gameing machine!!  standing next to my P4 2gig with 512 RD ram (should blow the xp away) ... it is much stronger ... the p4 is on its last leg and a 1.67 Ghz processor beating a 2Ghz with better bus/ram is just pittyful.<br>
<br>
If your building one of your own ... I would go with aobout a 1Ghz celeron (put plenty of fans in the case) ... there fairly universal, cheap, and straight forward on building.  also have alot of compatability with them.  <br>
<br>
MAKE SURE you buy the motherboard, processor, AND PROCESSOR FAN at the same time .... otherwise most places wont warentee any of it.<br>
<br>
make sure the RED cable on your floppy and IDE drives is on PIN 1 on the motherboard (usuialy has a arrow with a 1 next to it)  and normaly the red cable is faceing the power on the drives .... or will have a pin 1 label on it.<br>
<br>
other than that .... its just plug and play<br>
<br>
<br>
(make sure to Fdisk and format the harddrive before installing windows) <br>
<br>
<br>
I would also suggest win ME ....  the new win xp is just too messed up for me atm.... networking, admin, and repair ... is a pain in the a$$<br>
