If you look at most of our quests, they can be completed either by yourself or with a relatively small group of people.  The steps the must be completed in order to get FA are completely ridiculous!  Even though I know the steps of completion, I will not post them, just what is already known, so as to respect the hard work of others until they choose to post them.<br>
<br>
1)  In order to even start this quest requires massive amounts of players, in other words, either be well liked enough to get invited on a Sky raid or be part of an &quot;Uber guild&quot;.  <br>
<br>
2)  In order to get the final components for this quest rare dragon loot is required.  This is completely insane, even if the loot does drop and you are lucky enough to be there on a raid, there is still a low chance of actually getting the required components.<br>
<br>
3)  A good portion of this quest doesn't even lie on our abilities, but on the abilities of other classes.  (purposely vague here)<br>
<br>
4)  The weapon we are rewarded with is a 2h slashing weapon.  We are probably the ONLY melee type class that still uses our bash skill at high lvls, allow us our shield.<br>
<br>
5)  Some of the rare drop required components are also sought after by other classes.  Look at their numbers as compared to the number of high lvl paladins.  Then add in the spawn time of, oh say...Nagafen. <br>
When you look at those factors, our chance of getting the required components are almost nil.<br>
<br>
I am a relatively low lvl paladin on my server, I work a lot so I don't have a lot of time to play and get up where I want to be.  A lot of players work also, and when do the dragons usually get whacked?  While we are at work!  I agree that this quest should be epic, but there is a difference between epic and idiocy!  This quest is a clear example of the latter not the former.  Another thing is why should the quest I have to do for FA be the same as the quest you have to do?  Why is it that Verant could not make the quest have some unique forks in it so that we all get a different experience?  Also, why is it that our &quot;holy&quot; quests must be done by an extremely large group of players?  Our &quot;holy&quot; quests should be able to be completed solo or with a small group of friends.  <br>
<br>
This quest needs to be totally restructured.  This gets in to a case of the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; in so many ways.  Personally, I think that this quest should be a completely unique experience for everyone.  My own personal opinion of this quest is:<br>
<br>
1)  Keep it only available to high lvl paladins, in order to reduce the amount of twinks.  This would cheapen the blade and the experience.  In fact, why do we even have to go to Sky at all?  All that really has to be done is put the beginning NPC in a hard dungeon, like Guk or Sol B.  Further more, all that has to be done is that the AI performs a lvl check on the PC to make sure that he is of the proper lvl, in some way &quot;tag&quot; the character with his quest path so that no one else can listen in and turn in the items before him and this will prevent twinks.  <br>
<br>
2)  Don't make all of the items rare drops off of totally unique spawns.  Allow the people who have come so far a better chance to get this weapon.  Besides, not everyone will be going after the same stuff.<br>
<br>
3)  Make the quest center around us!  We're the ones going after this blade, why should a good portion of the quest rely on other classes?  (eg. wizards to teleport us to Sky and the like)<br>
<br>
4)  Make the damn thing a 1h slashing weapon so that we can use our shields.  St. George, Galahad, and similar knights are supposed to be what paladins are based on.  How do most people picture them?  Sword and shield.<br>
<br>
I am not a very good orator or I would have posted this on EQ's message board in order to get attention from the actual designers.  I would however ask Romidar for assistance (he is a far better orator than I), should he agree with on these matters so that we can bring some attention to what I feel is a grave injustice to all of us who truly deserve this blade, but possibly will not be able to get it due to competion from other classes or not being able to get enough people together in order to break Sky, or go on 2 dragon raids, or fight Myragul.  I hope that the majority of you agree with me and will join me on this.<br>

PS:  I am not doing this to be unfair to person who already acheived his FA, in fact I salute him in being able to bring together enough resources to complete this task.  I simply wish to bring attention to the unfairness that many have complained about and the apparent lack of foresight or sheer lunacy on the parts of the designers of this quest.<br>

<br>
<I>The FA is *not* as great now as when EQ first came out.  Back then a 33/44 (or whatever the stats really are) weapon was a truly awesome blade but since then many great planar and GM event weapons have been found/given out that compare to FA.<br>
<br>
There is no comparison in the difficulty of getting this sword compared with Rangers and Warriors obtaining planar weapons which, in some cases, outdamage FA (assuming the above stats).<br>
<br>
If it is 2HS then this really is a big mistake by Verant,  given that they acknowledged that most high-level Paladins use a shield, and therefore Bash.  I mean,  this is partly why they raised the bash cap isn't it ?<br>
<br>
The FA being 2HS really ruins it being our *defining blade*,  when we can't even use our secondary attack with it.  Anyone can used a 2HS Sword.  Paladins use 1HS and Bash - it's what we've become defined as using in EQ.  'See a high Lvl armor plated figure running towards you.  What class is it ?  Ah, see the Sword & Shield - yup, it's a Paly...'<br>
<br>
Well I wish everyone the best of luck in obtaining this blade.  I simply don't think it's worth the gargantuan effort to own it.<br>
<br>
To sum up; FA may be the best sword in the game, but it aint the best weapon,  and it's 2HS :-/</I><br>
<br>
I posted this on another thread but it sums up what i think.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to hear Gordon or Brad explain the reasoning behind why they made the quest as it is.<br>
<br>
Oh, and why it isn't 1HS.<br>

<br>
(1) Paladins do less damage than every other melee class, and verrant has said this is as it should be. We know this. We believe it is right.<br>
<br>
(2) Paladins can take damage better than anyone but a warrior. Our job is to take the hits, to heal those in need, and to save lives.<br>
<br>
Everything a paladin is about is defense. So we focus on AC. That is our 'defining' stat. This 'defining sword' is better suited for a warrior or a ranger, or even a SK. They worry about dealing damage. We KNOW we will never compete with the damage these other classes put out, and we dont try to. This sword changes everything. Without our shield, our AC drops below a bard, to about the same as a ranger. So now, our class has become a second rate ranger. WE DONT WANT THIS.<br>
<br>
Give us a 1HS sword that sucks, is flaming, and we would be happy. I would use it if it was the SAME as ghoulbane and flaming. Make it a LITTLE better (12/28?) and I would wish for nothing more. I KNOW im not going to do the melee damage of other classes, and I accept this.<br>
<br>
FA is a GREAT 2H sword. It really is. But it is NOT what paladins want or need. They dont need ANY 2H swords. Give this thing to some other class that would LOVE it and give us the 1H slasher we need.<br>
<br>
Verrant has chosen to make our 'class defining blade' our 'class re-defining blade'. It is a sword that paladins who have will have to decide whether it is right to use in a particular situation. Erudite paladins with sprinkler and shield of the stalwart seas have a very TOUGH choice to make. Many of them will chose to be more TRUE to their class and stick with the sprinkler, rather than deviating from how their class was defined to be the damage dealer, not absorber.<br>
<br>
&lt;shakes his head&gt; WHAT was verrant thinking? I dont think there is another class that this sword makes less sense for short of maybe wizards.<br>
<br>
Whats next? A sword that procs an AE lifetap from our own party members? How about a holy weapon that only procs on npcs that regard us warmly?<br>

<br>
The above posts are well said and thought out. Iustus, my paladin brother of Marr, hope all is well. OK....1st off, for you folks who want to come here and slam paladins who complain about the almighty sword, please take a look at all the rest of the quests a paladin must complete. <br>
<br>
Armor of Ro was supposed to be made easier to attain. It's not, even though verants claims it is.  Soulfire is not an easy quest to complete either. As a holy knight in this game, we don't have it easy (nor should we). <br>
<br>
So before you all go slaming paladins, take a look at what a paladin truely is and what he represents. Read the history behind our class and just maybe you might understand why we have the right to &quot;bitch&quot; about our class.<br>
<br>
Verant has no clue of what and how a paladin should be and most likely never will, &lt;wonder if we can sue them for discrimination of race and class&gt;&quot;LOL&quot;; anyway, a Paladin is pictured, and always has been the Holy Knight to help protect and defend those who can't. May they always be a proud class regardless of how hard the quest may be.<br>

<br>
you have a 100 some proc on a 44 weapon<br>
<br>
Stats on the Short Sword of the Yekesha<br>
you have a 48 proc on a 24 weapon<br>
<br>
hahahah, the Yak proc is almost as good at 96 per 48, that is so lame... not to even figure in the other Yak the person is holding.<br>
<br>
Either Verant doesn't understand the way melee works at higher lvls, or they do and hate Paladins for some reason... I'm guessing number one. Even with CoF this sword is delay 33, and the min damage is gonna be the same as with EVERY OTHER weapon. Not only would I rather use Ghoulbane on undead, 162 dam chance in 34 (Beats the piss outta the FA proc) but I'd rather use a EBW on live stuff... like we don't have enough problem keeping stuff glued to us when we need to, this slow toaster will make sure we never get hit, bah.<br>
<br>
The could at least make the damage per delay of the proc equivalent to Ghoulbane considering you have to turn it in, but no... how is this a defining blade if Ghoulbane beats it out. Doesn't matter if it's only on Undead, it still gets beat sometime in the week.<br>
<br>
Glad I wasn't lvl 50 and trying to get this sword, now I can just sit back and not give 2 $hit$... I'll get my EBW and be a Happy Paladin. Hell if I want to look like a k3wl d00de, I run around with Soulfire. Both suck unless you are trying to be a k3wl d00de.</font><P>Rathimis Dragonmist <BR>

<br>
That's a better proc than any other in the game that isn't specific to one type of enemy (e.g. the Ghoulsbane proc).  It's also the best damage/delay ratio of any 2hslash in the game... actually Sunderfury might still be better, I don't know, but it has no proc and no stat bonuses.  This is a VERY powerful sword.<br>
<br>
Unless you're an Erudite Paladin, you're only going to gain maybe 20-25 raw AC from a shield maximum.  That isn't enough to truly affect your semi-tank status even at high levels in the planes.  <br>
<br>
If you want a good 1hslash that's better (marginally) than Ghoulsbane, get a Deep Six Cutlass.  Nice damage, the underwater breathing comes in handy on Phinegal raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->  and it lets you still use that precious shield.  But I think if you'll do a comparison, you'd do more damage with an FA than with Deep6 and shield, or possibly even EBW and shield.  Especially if you add a FBSS or something similar to the FA.  Plus you're not going to see a catastrophic difference in your damage taking ability.  <br>
<br>

   I've been pondering the quest for the fiery avenger, and my place in the world. I've been thinking of what I love about this game and what I enjoy about playing my paladin. This new quest shows to me that the designers do not understand paladins. In a sense, they have a split personality when it comes to our class. Verant says we are defensive in nature, yet make our ,so called, defining weapon force us to choose an offensive role. I agree with you all that if I choose not to acquire this sword I do not have to. My response is, firstly, I do not have the means. Does this mean I do not have the friends or abilities? I don't think so. I am a holy knight defender of truth , love, and life. I have proven myself in these areas countless times. I care for my friends and they care for me. I, however, refuse to ask them for help in this endeavour. I am not alone, there are paladins who have proven themselves beyond reproach with peity unmatched in Norrath. These paladins will most likely never wield this weapon either. There is a purity, an honour, a responiblity that transcends certain material ideals. Some may disagree, and your god/goddess gives you this freedom of choice. But my duty is to the people, not to myself. I shall not wield this sword out of principle. It is not in keeping with MY vision of Norrath's holy knights. The powers that be do not understand...they probably never will. This is fine...the gods award them this lack of insight. I can only hope that someday they will be enlightened and a new age will be born from the ashes of this mediocrity. To the brave knights who have earned this weapon of power, I salute you. Please do not let my words detract from your accomplishments, you have been truly blessed. This paladin, however, shall savor her anonymity so that I walk amongst the peoples spreading the words of life and love and protecting and helping those who can not defend themselves. This is my role...and one I cherish. <br>
<br>
 Stormsilver Windsong <br>
 50th paladin of My lady Erollisi Marr<br>
 Xegony<br>
 I am to serve. <br>
<br>
ooc: I love my shields...I have many kinds and change them often. They are the single, defining symbol of who I am, as one poster said most eliquently. When someone sees a warrior in plate carrying a shield, there is no doubt this person is a Holy Knight. They know that they can ask for help and that thier cries and prays will be answered. They know we are there to serve and do so without question. That is why I play a paladin, that is who I am. I take the Fiery Avenger being made 2 handed as an insult to our class. This is my opinion, yours may differ. I hold out hope that Kunark will offer, for those of you who agree with me, weapons of power that allow us to continue to show our pride in the form of our gleaming shields. <br>

Although bash interrupts casters, it only does it rarely when you hit and with the damage this sword deals out the hit alone off it would probably interrupt a cast. And besides at level 50 you have 2 stuns that interrupt casts. I *never* rely on my bash to interrupt a caster because even after they raised the caps it still sucks.<br>
<br>
As for the complaint of &quot;i lose some ac from my shield&quot; well you lose some ac sure, but you gain an insane amount of stat bonuses and resistances, plus extra mana and hp. On a side note, with this sword you'd probably be hitting over 100pts of damage plus the 110pt (?) proc, the ammount of time it would normally take a creature to deal the damage the extra AC would prevent, it would be long dead. As if the sword wasnt good enough add a haste item and its even more awsome. Haste item + plus a hate spell/song and its undreamed of!<br>
<br>
Did you all really think they were going to make the quest easy?? i mean seriously? If you did you had your heads in the clouds...<br>
<br>
For months people have been complaining it wasnt in the game.. When asked what stats people would like, as i recall, it was almost exactly this if it were to be 2hs, its all that AND the added stat/save/mana/hp bonuses. And now that it *is* in the game all i read is how much it &quot;sucks&quot; and how we were &quot;screwed&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
To cut to the chase if you dont want the sword, or refuse to carry on with the quest, dont. Leave the books from the dragons to the paladins who make the best of their class and strive to play it to its utmost extent (no i dont mean &quot;powergames&quot; or people in &quot;uber guilds&quot;).<br>
<br>
Before the replys of &quot;oh you must be in an uber guild&quot; etc.. I'm NOT in a large guild, my guild is mainly a group of friends, many of whom are lvls 15-30. I dont expect to ever have this weapon in my handsever, But you can be DAMN sure that i'll be shaking the hand and patting the back of EVERY paladin on my server that gets this weapon. The ones who dont whine bitch and complain, but the ones that go and get the job done for honor.<br>

<br>
It's not that they made the quest too hard, it's more that they made FA 2HS instead of 1HS.  It may be the best sword in the game but Rangers and Warriors duel wielding <I> much</I> easier obtainable planar weapons will outdamage a Paladin with FA.<br>
<br>
But the main gripe is that it's not 1HS,  when Verant acknowledged that most high level paladins used 1HS & Bash.  It's meant to be our defining blade but we can't even use our secondary attack.  Don't you see the problem here ?  <br>

Um I don't really know what to say to you friend.  You seem to have little ability to grasp simple principles. "A SK with a Dark Reaver would own a Paladin..."  Are you serious ???  Surely not...  <br>

<br>
You people think that because your vision of a Paladin differs from Verant's that you are right.  NOPE.  They made the damn things.  Their game.  Their definition, and if they say this blade defines your class guess what... it does.  If you'd rather use a shield, so be it, but I guarantee you if you have a chance to get this sword you'll jump at it.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way, a warrior WILL outdamage you yes.  Usually.  That's the way it's SUPPOSED to be.  But a Shadowknight won't just in melee, as they are equally skilled in bladed combat as you Paladins are, and have no sword to compare with FA.  Monks will outdamage everyone bare-handed hehe.  But you're right there behind warriors with this thing, better than Rangers.  <br>
<br>
P.S. you guys keep mentioning warriors dual-wielding...  7 times out of 10 a warrior will do more damamge with a 2h than dual wielding 1hs.  Perhaps you should realize that Paladins are the same way.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=siegfried>Siegfried</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Local user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFFFF>3/19/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFFFF>4:11:26 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: What is Verant thinking?</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial"><I>The damage you would get from Bash is *TRIVIAL* compared to the increased output from this sword.</I><br>
<br>
As well as it might be true Syphet that's not really the point I'm making.  The point is that they, Verant, did acknowledge that most high lvl Paladins used a 1HS weapon and a shield.  Yet they made FA 2HS.  In my eyes it would have been better to make FA 1HS with reduced dmg, faster delay and allow us to bash as well.<br>
<br>
What happened to consistency ?  Verant obviously must have had a concept of having Paladins use 1HS weapons when they designed Ghoulbane.  They ignored this when designing FA and also their own data that showed we prefered to use a shield.<br>
<br>
You are right when you say that I would use FA if I had a chance of obtaining it.  But it also may be true that Kunark will bring 1HS weapons better than a Sprinkler that I can also use my shield with.  FA is a fine weapon, don't get me wrong.  But why couldn't they have made it 1HS ?<br>

When I was with Caldur on Bertoxx, I saw the mobs drop faster then if i was in a group of 5 casters, meaning the mobs were unable to hit us that much requireing less heal time and med time.
