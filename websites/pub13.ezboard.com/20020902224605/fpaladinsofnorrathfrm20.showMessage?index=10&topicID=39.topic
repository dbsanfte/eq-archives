How?</span><hr size=1> Crusader - can you tell me how many mobs you can kill per hour? <br>
<br>
I am pretty sure I get AA points at about the same rate you describe (if that fast!), which makes me think there's something funny going on with AA. Our equipment doesn't seem that dissimilar, and fighting constant dark blues with no downtime (fear kiting) I don't think I can get more than 1 AA point in 5 hours. Heck, I don't think I get much faster than that 2-boxing my 53 druid.<br>
<br>
Once I hit 58 I'll try keeping detailed records on kills per hour and amount of AA experience. If it is really the case that the amount of experience needed for one point of AA does not vary, then it should be impossible for someone who is 51 to get a point anywhere near as fast as someone at 60 (or 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
In other words, I'm wondering whether there's some &quot;correction&quot; going on in the game that actually modifies how fast you get AA based on your level. This isn't the first time that someone under 60 has posted that they get AA at nearly the rate of someone many levels above them. I haven't soloed much AA experience, though I did solo for a couple of levels when I returned to the game. I also know, though, that I kill mobs now MUCH faster than I did even a couple of levels ago.<br>
<br>
Just this past weekend I went back to BW to get my druid 53. I was killing all mobs that were dark blue to me (moldering gorillas, greater war boned skeletons, etc.). This was interesting because I soloed a LOT there against those same mobs when I was 54-55. I'm only 2 levels higher, but those same mobs dropped so fast it was startling. My equipment is much better (I was using an ACG then, am using an Argent Protector now, for example), of course. Fights that took several minutes now take less than a minute. If the amount of experience required for AA points does not change, then there's no doubt I should be able to get many times more experience per hour now than I could have 2 levels ago. Very curious! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

How?</span><hr size=1> Kills per hour? LOL I really have no idea but I can log a few hours next time I get to hunt.  I think the main reason why I'm getting such good xp rate is the places I fight.  Those places you do get a nice xp bonus fighting in those zones ( some nicer than others ) <br>
<br>
How many higher level dungeons have really nice xp mods that at level 60 you can solo at? and we all know that outdoor zones give crap xp vs a good dungeon which is why I'm fighting in those dungeons that have the bigger ZEM.  At level 60 the places I'm fighting at now would all be green and if I were at 60 I would have to fight over the other XP-Giving-to-level-60 Mobs with all the other AA seekers out there.<br>

How?</span><hr size=1> I really haven't looked at experience bonus in the higher end dungeons. I know that plenty of 60's solo in Chardok (I'll 2box there, but soloing doesn't seem worth it since it's about 30% undead).<br>
<br>
I spent my upper 40's in Kedge (grouping - no way could I have soled then, of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and the experience was very nice.<br>
<br>
You're probably right with respect to the experience bonus, though. It seems that a lot of paladins solo at 60 in Fungus Grove and the Grey. Although FG is &quot;indoors&quot; I assume that it doesn't get a dungeon bonus.<br>
<br>
Personally, I plan to spend a lot of time in Howling Stones when I'm 60 (helps that I have a druid to port me out; I haven't given much thought about how to get in there though... the welcoming committee is kind of unfriendly).<br>
<br>
Still, it's more than a little perplexing to me that one could go from 51 to 52 repeatedly anywhere NEAR as close to quickly as a person who is 60. Every time I or one of my group members levels I am thoroughly impressed with the difference it makes. My wife, my druid and I fight in Chardok in the mornings when we can. When I was 56, she was 55 and the druid was 51 we really could not keep up with the zone in spawns - we just had too much downtime and had several close calls because we were wounded and low on mana when the respawn started. Now I am 57, my wife is 57 and the druid is 53. We can clear zone in and zone out in one fell swoop and still have mana left over. Before, I'd occasionally have to helm heal, now I never do. The mobs drop SO much faster it's truly remarkable, and they are all still dark blue. With the 3 of us, I make 1-2% of the experience for 58 in one clearing of the zone in and her AA experience is flying (she just started run1 when she got a yellow into 57).<br>
<br>
What concerns me is that I am making my decision to go with level first over AA (with the exception of run3, which I got last week) based, in large part, on the idea that it is more effecient to get AA at 60 than it is at, say, 55. You are the second source (whom I trust as a source) saying that AA moves almost as quickly at 51 as it does at 60.<br>
<br>
I've said before that I almost wish I had done a bunch of AA at 51 just because the skeletons in DL were such fast, easy experience (I got through 51 in less then a week on those nice skeletons, so AA would have come at about that rate too).<br>
<br>
I guess, though, that's really not much of an issue for me now. I almost never solo these days, since my group is almost always on when I am. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>
