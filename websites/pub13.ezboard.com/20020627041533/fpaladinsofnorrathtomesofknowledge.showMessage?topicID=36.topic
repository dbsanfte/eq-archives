For each tep so far the AC STR and MR go up one. Currently 7 steps have been<br>                               done yielding a 7 AC +7 STR +7 MR ring. Pretty good so far. Wonder how many steps there<br>                               are. There are at least 8 so far with the 8th not yet completed. Found this on Druid's Grove:<br><br><br>                               Step 1:<br>                               go to Garadain and speak with him (-2700, -400). he will tell you he lost his blanket and<br>                               needs a new one. to make it you need 2 HQ tundra kodiak skins and 2 HQ cougar skins.<br>                               these 4 items are combined in a sewing kit to make the no drop blanket. this blanket is NOT<br>                               trivial at 70 when i made mine. and i heard people fail at skill up to 82 and such. so not sure<br>                               when it becomes trivial. give Garadain the blanket and he rewards you with the Copper<br>                               Coldain Insignia ring (1ac 1str 1magic). he also speaks now about another quest segment.<br><br>                               step 2:<br>                               Garadain speaks of his brother or something... Baridain. Baridain is out hunting for a Rabit<br>                               Tundra Kodiak and <br>                               needs his weapon. Garadain gives you an axe to give to Baridain and asks you to return with<br>                               proof that he is ok and turn in the ring. Go to Baridain at roughly -2500, 1500. its a plataeu.<br>                               give him the axe. the stupid dorf starts his little adventure. your job, KEEP THE @#%$<br>                               ALIVE! he goes to the giant fort to poke around, then up tward the prison guards, to the orc<br>                               fort, and then finally back to his spawn point. he doesnt have many hp so watch him<br>                               closely. (charm with chanter and buff him helps). once he gets back to his spawn point<br>                               alive, he mumbles about the stupid kodiak and then the kodiak spawns. kill the kodiak and<br>                               get the skin off of it. Give Baridain the skin so he thinks he's a good hunter. in return<br>                               Baridain returns to you a damaged axe. go back to Garadain and give him the damaged axe<br>                               along with the copper coldain insignia ring. in return you get the silver coldain insignia ring<br>                               (2ac 2str 2magic).<br><br>                               Step 3:<br>                               (Note: Skining Rock loc: -7600, 1150, it could spawn anywhere around the dragon statue)<br>                               Garadain needs a new skinning knife. he asks for you to make him one. to make it, you need<br>                               1 HQ walrus skin, 1 wooly rhino horn, and 1 skinning rock. combine these items in a forge<br>                               and it yields the coldain skining knife that Garadain needs. This item is not nodrop so i can<br>                               make it for you. was trivial at 190 skill. return to <br>                               Garadain and give him the silver insignia ring and the skinning knife. in return you get the<br>                               gold coldain insignia ring (3ac 3str 3magic). <br><br>                               Step 4:<br>                               This part gets a bit tricky. Garadain says the knife was good but its not quite up to his<br>                               specs so he wants a <br>                               coldain smithing hammer to fix the knife. speaking with him further he says that Tain<br>                               Frostbight has one. <br>                               Garadain gives you a note to Tain (which appears to be useless). when asked about Tain,<br>                               Garadain says he <br>                               left a short time ago to settle a score with a certain Kromrif. Head down to -4900, -2500 (or<br>                               very close to <br>                               there). Tain spawns there. but his last name is not Frostbight like Garadain said. its Tain<br>                               Frosthammer or <br>                               something. (he is on about a 40 minute timer). when hailed he says he is in trouble and<br>                               needs help. do not tell him you will help him til you are buffed up and ready for a battle!<br>                               When you tell Tain you will help him, he says that Khrak is coming for him with his war party.<br>                               The giants spawn when you tell him you will help him. Just east, near the bridge, 4 giants<br>                               spawn. one being Khrak. you need to kill Khrak and get the frost elixir off of him. Give Tain<br>                               the Frost elixir and he will give you the coldain smithing hammer. return to Garadain and give<br>                               him the hammer and the gold ring and he will return to you the Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring<br>                               (you guessed it... 4ac 4str 4magic).<br><br>                               Step 5:<br>                               Garadain tells you of some impending orc danger. he asks that you find the Ry'Gorr<br>                               messenger and get his <br>                               invasion plans. I dont know where this guy spawns, but he is not all that rare and seems to<br>                               roam between <br>                               the giant town and the orc fort. When you get the invasion plans, you need to turn them<br>                               into the coldain <br>                               lookout. he is in same camp as Garadain. When you give him the plans, a group of 6 orcs will<br>                               spawn. one <br>                               named guy. this is tough battle so make sure you have chanter to mez. the orcs spawn<br>                               about 200 feet off to the west of the camp. so have people there to get the agro. you dont<br>                               want the orcs getting to the camp, you might lose the named guy to the dwarfs. kill named<br>                               guy and get the head he drops. return to Garadain and deliver him the head and your<br>                               platinum ring. he returns you an Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring. (5ac 5str 5magic).<br><br>                               Step 6:<br>                               (once he hands you your new Obsidian Coldain ring, Note that he says: you have Proven<br>                               yourself)<br>                               Garadain Glacierbane says 'Without your assistance, we would have lost our camp and our<br>                               lives. Again, I thank you. Now that you have proven your loyalty to the throne I have a<br>                               special [favor] to ask of you. <br>                               You say, 'what favor'<br>                               Garadain Glacierbane says 'For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this<br>                               land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to<br>                               make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force.

When triggered, he makes four or five<br>                               stops. He first stops at the entrance to the giant keep he is closest to (around -1k 1k),<br>                               then goes NW to around 40 250, then SW to around -2k 1400, then SE to -3500 500, then<br>                               NW a bit to his final stop (where the Kodiak spawns). These are notes from last week and<br>                               they were scribbled hastily so I may be missing a stop, but he is an awful hunter, so he<br>                               basically runs to the entrance of a bunch of camps and stops (some time soon I will cull my<br>                               logs for specifics - he says some cute things at some of his stops).<br><br>                               Boridain needs to get the pelt before he despawns, so kill the rabid beast quickly and do the<br>                               turn in so you can get back to Garadain and proceed with your smithing.<br><br>                               I think this is, so far, one of the neatest, best designed quests I've run across.
