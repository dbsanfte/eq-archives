How much is Snare and Root going to get resisted against people in my level range? What classes are easy to fight, which ones should make me nervous? Are there any good sites with EQ PvP strategies?<br>

From what Ive seen so far, snare works almost always against other PC's.  I believe that it is considered a debuff.  In the rules, it says that all debuff spells are 50% more likely to stick on other PC's, so use it always I would say.  <br>
<br>
Against wizards one on one, I have used the technique of snaring them, then run run run, to edge of area where their casting range is.  From what I have seen, they can still hit you with a DD, but cant root you in a certain range (this range seems to be approximately the range of your dot line of spells for their dd's-so run out of range, then target them, start hitting your dot spell, and stop going towards them once your dot starts to work).  Let them hit you with ONE DD, run out of range, heal, run back in range, and let them start casting on you again. Take the dmg, run out of range, heal.  You will end up having a little under 1/2 mana on a closely leveled wizard, when he runs oom, then just beat the crap out of him with your weapon and keep him snared, throw a dot on him for good measure.  <br>
<br>
Use your sow, snare, and distance to kill when solo.  Otherwise, when you are in a group, just assist your main tank and snare and blast the target.  If you see a bunch of tanks jump on one of your guys, throw a damage shield on him, and keep that person healed.  There is alot you can do, use it.  In our 20's we get an AOE blind spell, would be good for a sneak attack on a group.  Keep chaining the blind spell from a distance (dont want to get yourself) you will be targeted by their casters, if they have pets, the pets will come after you, lead them on a merry little run while the rest of your group picks them apart.  <br>
<br>
All kinds of thing you can add, Im sure.  <br>

I know that my experiences will be less than applicable right now, but in a few months, once everyone that plays EQ as their life has had a chance to farm resist items, here's how it falls out:<br>
<br>
Don't expect to land a snare, a root, or almost anything magic based. When fighting equal level, it only takes 80magres to make you effectively impossible to snare (unless debuffed). When fighting people above or below you, the commonly accepted (at least among people I've talked to, and it seems to work from experience) formula is for every level you have over them, it's effectively -10 magic resist. So if you're fighting someone who has 6 levels with you, you're fighting at a big disadvantage.<br>
<br>
Everyone's weak resists are Disease and Poison. If you have those spells, use them. If you can buff those resists (yay druids), do it.<br>
<br>
About debuff spells working 150%, that's only stat debuffs. This doesn't affect snare or root landing at all. It does, however, make Tash especially nasty. Also Ro's Firey Sundering works well, lets you land all your DDs for the full 62.5%. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/10/01 7:47:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/rtfm.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid PvP tips</span><hr size=1> Sarvenost says:  <b><i>Don't expect to land a snare, a root, or almost anything magic based.</b></i><br>
<br>
...except for the (bugged) stinging swarm line, which is for all practical purposes unresistable in PvP.  If you play your cards right with stacking, your opponent can be dying as he desparately tries to pumice his way out of it.<br>
<br>
As for direct damage, any spell that's <b>not</b> "all or nothing" (i.e., can do partial damage) is decent on newbies because their resists aren't too high.  But don't bother casting DD spells on any kind of healer unless you're going to finish them off with one -- you will burn more mana than they do.<br>
<br>
IN EQ PvP, be glad you're a druid.  You're basically unkillable unless you go linkdead, are gang-banged, or make a really stupid mistake. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0> at: 7/10/01 7:48:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugallatin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallatin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 5:21:06 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://astro.temple.edu/~fmoffat/img/small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid PvP tips</span><hr size=1> Let me state unequivocally that I'm not above making a really stupid mistake :-)<br>
<br>
Interesting tip on the Swarm line. I don't think I have to worry about pumice for people in my level range currently, most of us are dead flat broke just trying to buy spells. I need to get to 14 quick :-)<br>
<br>
Also, for the time being, resists aren't applicable, as Sarvenost noted. Most players are still lowbies, although some of the guilds are just leveling at frightening rates. <br>
<br>
I need to farm Alla's and and the other equipment sites for lower level resist gear. <br>
<br>
Keep talking, I like hearing it, even if it's just stories about fighting the enemy. SZ is a good time so far.<br>
<br>
I made the trek to NK last night, was trying to find some wisps in my level range (9th level) to see if I could nuke them into oblivion. I never did find any, but damn, it's freaky de-cloaking to fight, knowing I could get waxed at any minute by a real human. NK is a little tough right now, leaves me way low on mana and hp, so I think I'll stick to Misty for the moment...I really need a few more spells, as well.<br>
<br>
I saw a blue con goblin peon in Runnyeye on my way home, and pulled him to the Misty zone line. Those little buggers have *insane* regen! I thought he was getting healed, the way his hp bar was climbing. I had to zone after getting him to about 25% 3 times.<br>

Those are some of the most useful spells we have. They will land in PvP just as reliably as on mobs. They are so reliable that I'm inclined to think that they don't even actually check for resistances, they just have a flat rate for resists for everything (barring very special mobs). It's the only thing I can come up with, since they get resisted as often by an orc pawn as they do by a wurm.<br>
<br>
Generally, when going into PvP (at 30+), you'll want to try one Ensnare (it's a 1.8 cast time, you're really not losing much). If that is resisted, DoT them and start your DDs. If you have the opportunity later to snare them, go for it, otherwise just go without it.<br>
<br>
Best low lvl piece of resist gear? Shiny Brass Shield out of CrushBone. 10MR rules. Gets you towards that magic 80%. (BTW, at 60-65%, nobody will be able to snare you most of the time, but it will still stick, occasionally) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugallatin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallatin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 8:03:05 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://astro.temple.edu/~fmoffat/img/small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid PvP tips</span><hr size=1> On this server, I've got about as much chance of seeing an SBS as I do seeing Nagafen in the next week :-) Off a good zone...I don't see them taking kindly to me waltzing in, although it does sound like a fun stealth op when I get to work early some morning...hmm, I really need SoW and See Invis soon :-) <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>

<br>
I've made a char on SZ and also am up to 9th.  Druid, team good.  I can share with you some of my experiences:<br>
<br>
When running around somewhere where ganking is a possibility, keep your target bar empty.  When someone casts on you, hit 'c' to con them.  If they are red, quickly gate.<br>
<br>
Those that will attack you will seldom do so without a major advantage.  Of the 8 or so times I have been PK'd so far, only one has not been by a single caster that was red to me (once I was nuked for 237 when I had 170hp).  The other time, my group was ambushed by a crafty group of gnomes.  They managed to snare our puller with multiples incoming, snared me and sicced four pets on me, and nuked our cleric to paste.  Our wizard took one down before they focused on him.<br>
<br>
Expect attack most frequently by a zone.  Thankfully, it is usually ez to escape.  Anywhere safe (crushbone for goods) will be so overcamped as to be not worth going to.<br>
<br>
When soloing in hostile territory, ALWAYS invis/hide while medding, and try to put terrain between you and any frequent routes of travel.<br>
<br>
Your chances of walking into Crushbone and surviving are not terrible - a lot of goods stupidly are trying to co-exist with newts.  Of course, there are also folks like me...  Anyway, your chance of getting an SBS is near-0 as the trainer hill is frequently the site of major KS battles - between goods.  The going price on an SBS is about 30pp.<br>
<br>
At our levels, everything seems to stick on everyone.  Once people get resist gear, it will be a different story. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usarvenosttz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SarvenostTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 12:43:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid PvP tips</span><hr size=1> On buff order, there are a couple of different schools that I've heard of, and it depends on how you play.<br>
<br>
Some people put SoW at the top of the list, then go in order from most to least. (After SoW, cast Firefist, then begin buffing) The advantage to this method is this: If you get snared, it overwrites SoW, it does not stack with it. This makes it easy to dispel the snare, re-sow, and continue the fight. It also leaves a buff slot open close to the top (click Firefist off), in case someone casts something on you you simply MUST get off, you only lose your SoW getting to it. This method is reccommended if you want to try to stay and fight it out if things start to go bad.<br>
<br>
Others use Firefist to open a slot at the top of their buff list, then buff least important to most important, with SoW and your resists at the end. Problem here is: You're relying on your resists to save you. If someone lands that Snare on you, you're gonna have to dispel all your buffs to get it off (Yeah, right), or Gate. I've seen both strategies used effectively at high levels, but honestly, I don't know which would have more application on SZ in it's current state. Probably option #1, because if someone snares you, it's gonna land, and you're gonna need to get it off (or run, but we'll assuming you might want to make it harder on your opponent than casting snare to run you off).<br>
<br>
Used to be that you also had to keep your Skin spell at the top of your buff list, because there were a few DoTs (especially Necro Dots 44+) that would overwrite it, though this was patched a few patches ago. About leaving a slot open: Do it. SKs love Engulfing Darkness, and if you don't leave a place for it, it's going at the end of your list, and you're gonna end up gating. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upinepath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pinepath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 2:27:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> swarm resists</span><hr size=1> I hardly think the swarm line is *bugged*.  some lines of spells are harder to resist than others.

Well, you do sort of have a point in that traditionally an insects spell would have a low save.  But in this case I would lean towards calling it a bug because it appears that every DoT spell that neither has initial damage nor a stat debuff has this "feature".  If Verant/Sony/whatnot actually had a clue and realized how it works, there's a good chance it would be nerfed (personal opinion). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaeelebpdm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AeelebPDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PvPMod- The Tactician</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 9:06:48 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://users.ev1.net/~chawk/eq/aeelebepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: swarm resists</span><hr size=1> As a druid your swarm series is your best friend.

<br>
One very viable tactic on the other Zeks is to buff your opponent with quick casting trash buffs like Skin Like Wood or See Invis, then throw on your DoT and lay waste. That can't be done on SZ because of the hard coding, but at the same time they seem to have made cancel magic same team only as well. That can work to your advantage as nothing sucks more than being debuffed, especially when spells are going to be your main source for HPS and resists on a new server.<br>
<br>
Buff order is very important if they do enable dispelling for other targets. My buffing is usually bladecoat, ROTG, resist magic, mask of the hunter, SoW, potg. I keep those buffs up 24/7 on TZ and they're in order of importance that I view. For a lower level druid with no gear you'll want to keep as many trash buffs as you can like Firefist up on top and bury SoW, resists, HP buff. always order your resists in importance to both the odds of you needing that resist and how good your unbuffed is. if you know the only enemy you're going to be charging is a wizard, PR and DR could go up top as trash buffs.<br>
<br>
at equal or higher level to your enemies with little to no resists, snare will actually be very useful. Just remember one thing, snare breaks rather quickly with bunches of nukes on players. if you have others with you, your best bet is to snare them and just keep them snared/dot'd while a melee pounds them. nukes will break snare and might allow them to get away.<br>

On sullon zek i think the key to living longer is to level like mad to 14th.  Then you can actually do some damage.  <br>

One thing that I used to use a lot when I was a n00be pvp druid is to use tree form while medding.  It is a great way to be unnoticed.  One time I had a posse of 10-12 dark elves looking for me in Nek forrest.  They never suspected to start clickin on trees.  Granted the folks using showEQ can find you easy enough but 95% of the folks wont think twice.  Be sure the tree is near other trees and no KoS mobs are nearby (They aren't fooled at all).  Also, dont move... a spinning tree isn't exactly an unnoticeable thing.  If you want to see whats around you, use F10 and check things out that way. <br>
<br>
Another tip someone may have mentioned is to keep gate memmed in the same spell slot at all times.  Learn to use your hotkeys (alt etc.) so that when you get blinded you can do a quick hotkey to get out of there.  <br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>

I need the speed advantage, I think :-) Hopefully my learning curve will consist of running away/gating when things go bad, and not getting killed and losing exp. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the ideas on the trash buffs, there are a lot more than I had realized. Keeping my target bar open is a great tip too.<br>
<br>
I'm very curious to see if Cancel Magic is cast-able on opponents. I can't imagine it won't be, but I'd like to know before I try to use it. <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>

<br>
As the game progresses you'll find difficulty landing snare on players with 80+MR within your level range<br>
<br>
After about 120 MR forget it.<br>
<br>
With 170-200 MR I can't remember ever having been snared, even when malo'd or Tash'd from an enchanter.<br>
<br>
The swam series isn't bugged, its as it should be, it has a set chance of being resisted irrelavent of your MR, the only time it will always be resisted is if a mob is flagged as being MR.<br>
<br>
A level 14 druid will land there dot on a 60 druid.<br>
<br>
The same goes for necro MR based DoT's, Boil Blood, Vexin and Splurt.<br>
<br>
However these dots are very easy to remove with cancel magic - so only an unprepared player need to worry about them (tanks who are clever will always carry a health supply of pumice).<br>

<br>
1) Firefist<br>
2) See invis<br>
3) Strength of Karana<br>
4) Circle of Winter<br>
5) Bladecoat<br>
6) Resist Disease<br>
7) Resist Poison<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Mask of the hunter<br>
9) Circle of Summer<br>
10) Regrowth of the Grove<br>
11) Resist Magic<br>
12) Levitate<br>
13) Protection of the Glades<br>
14) Spirit of the Wolf<br>
15) Normally I have another classes buff - symbol/clarity 2 or I'll just fill it with My damage shield.<br>
<br>
A few points.<br>
Why 15 buffs ? well dots/debuffs will always goto the first empty space, before i could fill my buff stack, i just clicked off firefist and see invis so any dots landing would go there and i could dispel them as i saw fit.<br>
<br>
Now i have 15 buffs I don't need to worry about it, they just overwrite my first useless buffs - quite often i'll get fighting a necro and they'll splurt me, then dispel me to try and remove my sow/buffs, only to remove their own dot...<br>
<br>
Why is CoW so early in my buff stack ? Well Malo is unresistable and overwrites the buff (Mala/Malo is a 60-70 debuff to MR/PR/FR/DR in PvP). This way if a shaman or a mage casts it on me I can just click of my first few buffs and dispel it rather than have it stuck deep in my buff stack.<br>

<br>
that's similiar to what I'd use if I was running into battle, although I put PR/DR a little deeper as those are lower than my FR/CR/MR.<br>
<br>
The 15 buff idea is interesting, I usually just use a telescope and firefist to create blank spots at the top. <p>--------- Aeeleb Treelover, the Tactician<br>

I would just unclick them. It is faster then using the dispell spell . Once all your buffs are gone then use dispell to get rid of snare. But remember if you get snared, gate or self tp to ring and then unsnare urself.  <br>
