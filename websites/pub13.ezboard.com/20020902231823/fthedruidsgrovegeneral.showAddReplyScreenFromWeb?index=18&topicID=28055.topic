Ahhhh, so that is the solution. Quit. Just like so many other druids have done. Well, I for one am not quitting. I have put a lot of time into playing a druid and I refuse to quit the class now. I rember back when rangers were broken. Many quit because of it. But others stuck with the class. They kept telling Verant that the class was broken, and eventually it got fixed. I rember when paladins were broken. Many quit the class because of it. But others stuck with the class. They kept telling Verand the class was broken, and eventually it got fixed. I rember when mages were broken...... I am going to be one of the people telling Verant that our class is broken and not one that quits the class to come back only after it is fixed. And in the mean time, I'm not going to pretend everything is alright either. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustumpsmistrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stumps  Mistrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 1:18:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28055.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stirring up an argument....</span><hr size=1> Tal, im not telling her to quit, just saying that one should have fun, if they arent having fun playing their druid, then play another class that makes them happy.

<br>
I did not change. The game did and while I am able to adapt to almost any situation I cannot change the hard numbers.<br>
<br>
Get ready for a shocking statment....<br>
<br>
Playing an average Druid is easy and why many pick the class but playing a GOOD Druids is hard - one of the hardest classes in the game!<br>
<br>
*waits until the laughter dies down*<br>
<br>
What other class has to know how to be a Wizard, A Clerics, A Chanter, A Shamen ect...?<br>
<br>
I did not pick a Druid because I thought it was easy. I swear to you that I have never quadded (prefer root-dot) and I have spent more time helping others than I have played for myself. What does that get me? It gets the door slammed in my face on raids as no matter how good or nice yadda yadda I may be I'm not the right class!<br>
<br>
How many times will you be placed in the "leftover" group on a raid before you get it.<br>
<br>
What other class has to be able to enter a group and at a drop of a dime switch play style or switch in the middle of a bad pull? Swithc spells in mid-pull because too many were pulled ect...<br>
<br>
I'm still working on being a good Druid. I'll always be - it's the only class I play or will ever play.<br>
<br>
Why am I mad? Because "some" (not all) come to this board and do they help us fix the damn Druid class? No! They say all is well I can solo just fine or group or on raids I just play my other class.<br>
<br>
Bullsh-t!<br>
<br>
I don't have another class! I "was" happy with the Druid Class I played until raid level.<br>
<br>
I thought I was a decent Druid but on large raids I watch my group die on me when I run out of mana due to my horrible mana/heal ratio spells.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you all but when I do get in on a raid I most certainly am NOT going to inform the raid leader what group and classes I prefer or what "I" will do on the raid.<br>
<br>
They slowly changed the rules on Druids and those "Happy Joy Joy" Druids are the very reason Verant can say - "See many Druids love their class - nothing must be wrong just a few "bitter" druids.<br>
<br>
I have provided hard numbers in another thread. The numbers do not lie. Druids have slowly lost power over three years.<br>
<br>
With so many other classes pounding on Druids it's no wonder people get angry when those of our own class go la la la la and play right into their hands.<br>
<br>
So I should petition Verant and provide the facts and figures showing we are broken (yes I said broken and not "slightly unbalanced") at high level, fight our own who are la la la la la everything is fine la la la la or<br>
<br>
GIVE UP????<br>
<br>
Start a "wanted" class and maybe in a year or two (Took me three years to get 60 the way I play) I'll play a high level class that is wanted...<br>
<br>
Maybe EQ will still be around then.<br>
<br>
Maybe the class I picked will get nerfed or broken and if I complain about it people will tell me to start yet another class.<br>

<br>
Why do I need Heal 3 to be in a teir 1 guild?<br>
<br>
Heal 3 was required before they dropped the 10% healing penalty for Druids.<br>
<br>
Now that we heal 10% better (JUST like heal 3) now all the Teir 1 guild have just opened their doors?<br>
<br>
We know this is BS. High end guilds place all kinds of road blocks for Druids because they do not want us. Other classes do not have such restrictions why should we. Why should Druids have to have a zillion alt points to help balance us and even with all these points it still is only an extra 10% healing ability.<br>
<br>
A level 60 is a level 60 and as long as a good player or high standards willing to play by a guild rules applies any "requirements" should be the same for ALL the classes.<br>
<br>
Most high end guilds will take ANY cleric as long as they have CH and are the proper level. No AA points as a Cleric.... NO problem as long as you can click the CH key at the right time. You dont' have your epic as a Cleric - NP we'll get it for you. Missing spells Mr. or Mrs. Cleric NP - we have them in the bank for you.<br>
<br>
Mr. or Mrs. Druid are you level 60 with 50 AA points, have your epic, ALL your spells, all your resists, Keys to every zone in the game?<br>
<br>
We'll consider you. Don't call us we'll call you.<br>

<br>
<br>
But in contrast Cas, how fun is it to be just another cleric in the cheal train, to compete w/ over a dozen others of the same class.  <br>
<br>
10% to my heals, thanks.  But I don't want to be a healer, a 2nd rate healer will never be desired over another cleric.  It just aint gonna happen.  Give me the tools to help the raid like all other classes.  All melee, wizards, necro's etc.  We have less then a handfull of buffs that everyone might want, but don't less us fall out of range on damage.  <br>
<br>
Remember what was necessary for hybrids?  Rangers/Pallys/Sk's did crap for damage, thus people stoped playing them.  Everyone started a warrior, then monk, then rogue.  And when new servers opened up, almost no new hybrid players.  People still play druids because we are fun  I'll never give up my druid.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather I stuck w/ my monk at this point though.  I've got over 160 days played and started when EQ hit the door.  If I stuck w/ my monk I started that day, I know I'd be more helpful on every raid I went on. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65433>fris</a>

It takes about 6 months to a year to see the effect. The "most" wanted class two years ago was the Enchanter. (this was when Rangers, SK's and Rogues were broken)<br>
<br>
Everyone rushed to make one and now chanters are alot more in number.<br>
<br>
A year ago Mages and to a lessor extent Druids were broken and everyone started to create Monks and Rogues.<br>
<br>
But monks and rogues stack pretty well so I do not see that as much of an issue. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

Do you know what makes me happy?  Seeing our suggestions to help our class slowly get implemented.<br>
<br>
It didn't happen because we all sat here singing kumbaya and saying how great Druids are and how we are perfectly fine.<br>
<br>
Just remember, its people like Cassea that got the 10% penalty removed, fixed Moonfire, got Moonfire and MoS dropping off more than one mob, and the other little changes we've seen.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the &quot;I'm perfectly happy with my crap @#%$ druid, doing crap @#%$ things&quot; crowd.  It was the bitter ones who gathered the info, made the suggestions, and are slowly (very very slowly...needs to be faster) watching the fixes roll in.<br>
<br>
So before you suggest they need to play another class, or that they are wrong...look at what rewards <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have reaped because of the Bitter crowd. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">
