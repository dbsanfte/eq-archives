Please, took me 372 RL days to get mine and this was WAY before FCFS. I stayed 51/52 for nearly 10months and decided screw it, one day I will be able to attend a gore talendor raid. When the FA first started I started making alts in cities to check, and a dam good friend of mine serran from KTF was doing the same and we both gave each other the same amount of info. When we both came to the conclusion it had something to do with POA, KTF decided to do airplane and of course I asked if I could go which I got a no. Doesnt bother me to much though I can see they would like there guild to have the first paladin with one.<br>
<br>
A month later there was a spoiler for the quest and I knew I had to kill dragons. From then till I got my books how many times did DD Unity EA and others took the naggy vox raids skyfire/stasis had that WERE set on the rotation? Lets be honest here. Uber guilds back there were ALL about helping themselves even if it meant running down and killing something out of rotation.<br>
<br>
Your mad about your epic? Try hitting 60th level with 210days played because you logged on and stayed 51/52 for almost 10months, left to do nothing but kill in unrest of mistmoore and beg people to attend there dragon raids.<br>
<br>
Stasis/PDF has been FCFS and brought out in the open since november, its now what febuary? Because if you look back, all the complaining when we went fcfs was with VS and Hate when TA had it planned. Only reason I know that was because I took a break from eq and got phone calls informing me of what was going on, so I came back from my break to find out.<br>
<br>
So thats 3 months right there. Took you 9months to get your epic? So in the 6 months time of NON fcfs you couldnt manage to get the help you needed? Or is it easier for you to blame someone for the lack of help you got before we became fcfs? Is it the fact that your upset with having to wait so long you need to vent on these boards to make yourself feel better and in hopes that everyone that reads this board will feel better and like you more?<br>
<br>
Is it the fact that your only jumping on the bandwagon of others to be liked in the comunity(sp)?<br>
<br>
Everyone here bitches and complains about stasis/pdf, yet when someone ran over them back in 2000 they would complain for a second then let it die because they didnt wanna look bad to those uber guilds. Back in the skyfire days we were fcfs'd and ksed many times and yet we didnt complain, we didnt come to the boards and said DD took naggy and vox, they should disband there guild.<br>
<br>
Back when DD tried to do dain and poofed him, no one from KTF ( which I believe was next on rotation ) or from unity for that matter came here and said disband that guild. They made a very funny movie clip of it but thats about it.<br>
<br>
Yet we do something back in november as small as hate and vs and we need to disband the guild?<br>
<br>
Listen, yes waiting for your epic for a long time sucks, but dont blame a guild just because you need someone to blame for your lack of being able to plan something, get help, or just being able to be somewhere at the right time.<br>
<br>
If you noticed I did not flame you in any part of this post why? Because where does that get you? No where at all. Your probably going to flame me for posting this as well as others which oh well, cant make everyone happy. But before flaming actually get the facts first and then look back and see everything in that 9month period of getting your epic. 3 months we have been fcfs now. Not 9months.<br>

finally the fuxer spawns with a staff and noone in hate, we all rush to Sro to see another guild is prepering to go up on hate, some of us was ready to just run them over before they even can get buffedready and gate up, because we knew how bad hata wanted his epic, but one of our officers said chill down and sat down and talked it over with the other raid leader, and they came to an agreement, they got all the lewt if hate would get the staff, and it came to that, not only did the other raid get a smooth low death rate raid, but also pretty awsome lewt and fast so they could get to do other things.<br>
think like 2 cleric bp, 2 warrior bp, 4 cleric legs, and some shaman and rogue stuff.<br>
and btw GRATS AGAIN on your epic hata, you deserved it.<br>

Hmm???  Go talk to Nygdup...<br>
<br>
Is it our fault that you are constantly needing them to bail you out?  How about doing it yourself for once.<br>
<br>
<br>
And epic....what is your problem.  Are you another of these "i pay my 10 bucks, I want my drive thru spot and epic now".  I know of a level 60 monk that didn't have epic until AFTER he joined PDF.  Why didn't he have it?  B/c he was always helping people get theirs....some ungrateful bastards, some really nice people.<br>
<br>
<br>
The "meth" he is refering to is, METHoshc perhaps?  THe person who posted about it already....oh wait...that's me.<br>

Get off your high horse, go line up so tora can make his doll of you, and take it like you know you want it from him.   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38733">
