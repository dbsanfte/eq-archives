And complete heal allows them to heal 'far better than druids'.  I've never seen any Druid heal rotations against major targets.  You can not pretend that Clerics do not get this spell.  You can not talk about healing without considering this spell.  The entire endgame is BUILD with this spell in mind.  To say that clerics would not be able to heal better than a druid is a falacy as long as this spell exists in the game.<br>
<br>
As was pointed out by a non druid in the petition when he signed it, Every function in the game is provided by at least two classes on high end raids EXCEPT for healing.  Clerics are the sole and only factor in the healing sucess of a raid.  Replaces each cleric in a CH rotation with 3 druids and you're going to end up with a dead tank.  Why?  Because the mobs are quading for double and tripple our damage output so when our heal lands when they are low, the next round of damage kills the tank.  It just doesn't work, we've tried it.<br>

Bitch at the mages, they have the 33 point damage shield that means that druids don't cast em.  MoK and MoR are more usefull than you think as they help offset AE damage to the mele classes.  Tell ya what, I'll trade you my damage shield for your MoK and MoR.<br>

You haven't looked at the ranger class lately have you?  The raiding raingers regularly get 1400ish atack, 1200ish ac, and they put out a LOT of damage.  They also provide key bufs to a raid in the form of call of the predator and call of the earth.  My guild lost all of it's 60 rangers for a time and we really felt the effects of their not being at the raid.<br>

Yes, druids are the swis army knife.  But if you look at their relative power and role 1-50, and then 51-60, you will find a disparity such that they are unable to fill in for many of the classes they used to be able to fill in for.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ok, fixed 2 problems with it.<br>
But I still fail to see why druids need better healing spells.<br>
If you can point this out for me I would gladly sign you petition. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Most high end raids involve AE damage.  Some of this is unresistable damage.  Also, when a player falls to about 1 or 2 bubbels of life, many high end mobs will automaticaly attack and kill that person, regardless of their position on the hate list.  This makes keeping them healed a high priority.<br>
<br>
These same mobs also require a complete heal rotation.  This means that most of the clerics on a raid are busy and unable to heal their groups.  Raid leaders look to druids to fill this job.  Why?  Shamans are busy trying to Malo/slow the uber boss mob, and that might just well get them killed.  Duiring the first minuet of the fight the shaman will be unable to be throwing heals around.  However, if he waits that long to start healing, everyones life will be too low for him to keep them above the auto death agro limit.<br>
<br>
This means that the only preist class left AVAILABLE to raid leaders is druids.  We get asked to start healing groups as soon as the damage flys and we do so.   We don't want better heals to stomp over all the other preists toes.  We want them because the other presits are busy doing more important raid tasks against the target.<br>
<br>
This leaves us with 3 or 4th tier heals (depending on how you slice the healing spell comparisons) to heal massive AE agro.  Yes, I can sorta cope though it if I have another 2nd tier healer to help me but I still have at least 2-5 group member deaths a raid because I can't keep up.  Clerics who are not in the CH rotation are at 60% yet I'm at 10% after every fight.  When I cast my level 60 heal on a caster and I see one bubble move, only for half that bubble to disapear 3 seconds later and the other half 6 seconds after that to be gone, while I'm in the middle of casting that same heal on another caster it's damn depressing.  I can't keep up with the damage per second that mobs are doing.  If a fight runs too long for ANY reason people WILL die.  I'm level 60, with 300ish resists.  Yet, I still take massive damage during the fights as well.  You can't say I need more resists or a higher level.<br>
<br>
This is why druids need to heal better.  Because we are the only ones left over to do it.  It's not something we ask to do, it's something that is thrust upon us because the other two preist classes are BUSY doing stuff that ensures the raid will succede.  If they don't do that job, the raid is over before it starts.  That leaves druids to fill in the gaps.  But we aren't filling in very well.  Every level 60 druid in my guild that has quit their druid has either made a cleric or a warrior.  Think about that and ask where the balance is. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

-------------------<br>
<br>
This petition is aimed, from what can see, at the highest end raiding in SoL, maybe 5% of the game.<br>
<br>
By asking Vi to balance Druid for that 5% you are going to overpower the other 95% of the game.<br>
<br>
Most Druids will admit that in normal XP grinding and older world raids they can hold their own quite nicely. When Vi released SoL they &quot;WANTED&quot; a raid sernerio where all the normal tactics couldn't be used. They wanted to make SoL a raids worst nightmare and I think they did a great job in doing it.<br>
<br>
With most mobs almost 100% MR resistant no caster is really needed except wizzy's.<br>
<br>
To balance everyone you either have to reduce SoL to another kunark style raid with low hp, low MR mobs like Trak etc etc OR accept that in the highest end SoL raids you can't offer all that much because SoL was designed to push a guild to their very limit and then go way beyond it.<br>
<br>
I have often been in Seb partnered with just a lvl 60 Druid and lvl 60 Pally (I was playing my 60 chanter) and we would often clear the whole of Seb late at night when everyone else had gone to bed.<br>
<br>
For a normal xp grinding group a Druid is totally balanced imo. A lvl 60 Druid can stack mana regen on top on C3 for insane regen and can heal almost a 1000 points of damage a cast. A druid can easily keep up heals. In Velks a Cleric is actually considered an XP sponge and Druids or shammy's are &quot;preferred&quot; over a cleric because of the heals they can do and the other uses they have.<br>
<br>
I have 2 druid, 1 high lvl, 1 mid lvl so this is a Druid saying all this.<br>
<br>
Instead of just signing the petition because you want to be overpowered sit back and think about what's being asked here. Why dont you just petition that you also want 2k damage nukes, weps that give you the same damage output as a rogue, Clarity 3, Mezzing abilities and be done with it.<br>

<br>
To balance everyone you either have to reduce SoL to another kunark style raid with low hp, low MR mobs like Trak etc etc OR accept that in the highest end SoL raids you can't offer all that much because SoL was designed to push a guild to their very limit and then go way beyond it.<br>
<br>
I have often been in Seb partnered with just a lvl 60 Druid and lvl 60 Pally (I was playing my 60 chanter) and we would often clear the whole of Seb late at night when everyone else had gone to bed.<br>
<br>
For a normal xp grinding group a Druid is totally balanced imo. A lvl 60 Druid can stack mana regen on top on C3 for insane regen and can heal almost a 1000 points of damage a cast. A druid can easily keep up heals. In Velks a Cleric is actually considered an XP sponge and Druids or shammy's are &quot;preferred&quot; over a cleric because of the heals they can do and the other uses they have.<br>
<br>
I have 2 druid, 1 high lvl, 1 mid lvl so this is a Druid saying all this.<br>
<br>
Instead of just signing the petition because you want to be overpowered sit back and think about what's being asked here. Why dont you just petition that you also want 2k damage nukes, weps that give you the same damage output as a rogue, Clarity 3, Mezzing abilities and be done with it.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> In regards to AE damage if you are the backup healer in a group....your job is to keep the cleric alive. Keep the cleric alive while he/she casts the long casting time Group Complete heal and saves everyone else. You DONT do this the entire party dies, repeat and the raid wipes. And who do you think casts the resists for these AEs? Druids, Enchanters and Shamans NOT clerics. And groupCH is a frequent NToV cast, Im not going to go into all the mobs you will load it and use it on but it gets cast there a lot and yeah I depend on the druids to keep my butt alive while I cast it. <br>
<br>
Damage Shields....if you have 2 or 3 mages they will all be consumed with mod-rod production and will INITIALLY cast DS on tanks. After DS wears off or post res the tanks wont give a tinkers damn who casts a DS on them so long as they have it and frequently that will be a druid.<br>
<br>
DoTs....Necros now keep Dots stacked on mobs to maximize damage per second against a mob and to offset regen. Shamans are usually way to busy with slowing, debuffing and rebuffing dead folks mid-fight to actually cast the DoTs. Not to mention casting Torpor on the people rodding.  So barring some serious stacking issues I would say that druid dots would be welcome. <br>
<br>
Sunder and Disjunction are welcome as debuffs to ensure that the fire based Necro dots, wizard fire based nukes hit not to mention Wildfire. <br>
<br>
Druids as backup healers? Yes frequently in classes where you have Rogues, Monks, and Rangers because they arent supposed to get agro and if they do they jeopardize the agro situation of the MT and they OUGHT to die. Druids can keep them alive long enough to use their agro reducers and get off agro because quite frankly anything longer jeopardizes the raid. Druids also get assigned as backup healers in Wizard groups to offset rod damage while wizards go all out DPS to kill a mob faster. These druids are also encouraged to nuke conservatively to keep the damage pouring in. <br>
<br>
Druids you have a niche at raids. It just doesnt mean that 9 of you are going to be welcome at any given raid. <br>
<br>
<br>
Belkram <br>

PS Disagree with this if you like Im speaking from experience about group interaction at raids.<br>

<br>
I'm a 59 druid/50 cleric, and here's my own wishlist<br>
<br>
<br>
Point I<br>
<br>
First off, I think Alchemy needs an OVERHAUL, and I thought of an interesting way to do it.  First, make potions into beverages of varying strength, (i.e. this is a whistle whetter, the is a refreshing drink, etc)  This will do two things...  First, it will limit the number of potions a player can drink in a given time frame.  Second, it will make players more careful about where they store their potions.  Both of these are to counteract the next set of ideas....<br>
<br>
Make alchemey a viable part of the shaman raid experience.  I.e. because you choose to make Alchemy a zero-time one-click like all trade skills, it would be even more interesting if there was valid reasons for a shaman to be MAKING POTIONS ON RAIDS during downtime.  Some potion costs have to be brought down a bit, or have their yields raised.  Also, there should be even more potions, perhaps some that do damage.  A potion that allows the user to breathe fire/ice/poison would be interesting, for example.(and what a taunt!)<br>
<br>
This could finally bring alchemy to the forefront of the shaman's life, which is where it should be, despite the shaman's many other impressive abilities.<br>
<br>
Point II<br>
<br>
Bane lines, those VS undead, summoned, animal, etc... these need some work at the high end.  It is horrific that druids, mages, etc would rather use their normal spell lines against summoned rather than their summoned lines.  Simply put, at level 60, their should be a vs summoned spell for druids and mages that beats Wildfire, in total damage, mana effiecieny, and cast time. 5% in each area would be plenty.  Similarly, at level 55, there must be a spell that is superior to scoraei, by a small amount.  The VS undead lines, of course, should be changed to syncronise with the VS summoned lines.  Also, perhaps some new lines should be introduced.  VS animals, insects, plants, fungus.  These lines of course might be better suited for the shaman, wizard, necro, or whatever.   Also, mega-quests for special wizard only bane spells, if they don't exist yet, would be cool. (Shissar, Seru, Grimling, Akheva)<br>
<br>
Point III<br>
<br>
Spells which required an imbrued gem to cast!  By their very nature these spells would be diety only.  Furthermore, these spells would then cause a mana-intensive preparation before big fights, (to have plenty of components).  For the druid of karana, it would mean spending time &quot;communing with nature&quot; spending time in the karanas foraging plains pebbles.  I haven't bought the imbue plains pebble spell yet because it is useless to me so far.  If it fed a special debuff, nuke, or buff, then I'd spend more time &quot;communing with nature&quot;<br>
<br>
Point IV<br>
<br>
As you can see, I'm already suggesting a LOT more content, requiring multiple spells to cast.  Which brings me to my next, most absurd request...  The ability to remove spells from the spellbook(the spell scroll would appear in inventory).  This will help players organize their spellbooks, and possibly prevent an extension of the spellbook that would otherwise be inevitable.  Also, this would be an extreme boon to newbs looking to save a buck or two, as higher levels rip their spells outta their books to pass on to a new generation.  (or perhaps you'd like to keep your level 1 nuke handy... I sure don't)<br>
<br>
Point V<br>
<br>
Okay, now that's I've bored the piss out of a lot of people, time for some dr00d-only goodies.  These are druid spells I'd love to see.<br>
<br>
spell 1: (tentative title: Connection to Nature)<br>
level 55-60<br>
duration: 1 minute beyond recast time<br>
recast time: over five minutes, preferable 20+ (i.e. this spell, if cast at all, will chew up a spell slot, werewolf form style)<br>
cast time: if it lasts longer than 10 minutes, VI can give it a 30 second cast time for all I care. :P<br>
Effect: single target hit point increase (at least 500, 1000 even better :)  )<br>
possible damage shield<br>
possible AC<br>
possible proc chance<br>
possible regen<br>
Mana cost: somewhere along the lines of 2:1 on the hit point increase (i.e., 250 is it does 500, 500 if it does 1000)<br>
<br>
This gives a druid a spell to cast on the main tank on a raid, which stacks with everything, and makes a druid a valued completion to priest buffing.  Thus, the combined power of shaman/druid/cleric adds to extend a tank's life and durability.<br>
<br>
spell 2: (tenetive title Herbal Remedy)<br>
level: 55-59<br>
recast time: immediate<br>
cast time: FAST, faster than chloroblast(say 2 sec)<br>
size: 400+ <br>
efficiency: greater than 2.5+ (more than CB or NT)<br>
component: Herbal mixture<br>
Notes: on a 4k tank, cheal does 400hp/second.  at recast time, it still does over 300/second. and, it has effieciency of 10 hp/mana!  Thus, allowing druids to heal 200+/second, at effieciencies lower than 5 hp/mana(much less 10) won't come close to replacing cheal, or devaluing clerics.<br>
<br>
The component, herbal mixture, is made in a mixing bowl.<br>
it takes: (you guessed it) one vegatable, one fruit, one berries, and one roots.  If this isn't &quot;limitation&quot; enough, make it NO RENT (to imply the mixture must be fresh)<br>
<br>
On a sidenote, they could give fruit a new graphic to differ it from berries.  A red ball, perhaps?  if they go all out, maybe even with leaves?<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
P.S. I saw that one of the cleric I grouped with, Caudex, said he is not in favor because Druids nuke better than mages.  Druids didn't ask for a better nuke in this petition, but, in all fairness... yes Mages should nuke better than druids... and Mages should get more viable high end single-target nukes (so that they don't use their AEs near quest mobs, like say oh Kazzel D'Leryt like Caudex's wife Radiac did HA HA HA).<br>
<br>
While mod Rod 2, Subversion(Necro mana pump), and Enchanter spells are all awesome, lure-type spells on these classes are needed.  When a druid gets resisted, he can always resort to assist healing if bored.  Now, the non-wizard lures to these other pure casters should be lower effieciecy, lower damage, and longer cast time than wizard's, as well as later in level, but they are fair.  Druids, of course, should not get a lure line.<br>
<br>
As for dots... Necros have what 5, six stacking lines of dots?? even with an upgrade to WD druids will never come close to necro power.  I would not so much prefer an upgrade to WD as a smaller cold-based dot, or VS summoned/animal/etc bane dots.  Also, dots are less a high-end raid issue than soloing issue.  For me, dots(damage dealing) are very low priority, the healing/buffing is what we need imporovement in.  Personally I think the most damaging portion of the petition is the dots part, as it has nothing to do with the healing power boost needed.  But it does make for a more complete wish-list I'll admit.<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
Ok, I'm done for now...  I hope this adds a new flavor to the debate.<br>

Ok, that's about enough.  If you can't be bothered to read the fourteen hundred times we have said we don't want CH, then you have no place in this discussion.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for group heals overpowering druids, you do realize that there is already a class besides the cleric that has these?  And that the do a better job than druids keeping their groups alive under AE damage?  And that they also MELEE!<br>
<br>
Cut the crap.  Druids are asking to be given the tools to fulfil the role that RAID LEADERS PUT US IN.  Why is that so hard to comprehend?<br>

Just read Kegwell's comments and you can see the mentality of many of those posting here. <br>
<br>
I know that if they posted a petition I wouldn't behave as poorly as they are.<br>
<br>
I fully support other classes getting enhancements and being viable more often in the game. <br>
<br>
Example, clerics are very unhappy about their roles in many situations, soloing is only one of them. I would love to see them address this with Verant. <br>
<br>
Necro's and mages in many ways are worse off than we are and I completely support them getting enhancements.<br>
<br>
Kegwell, I remember doing none of what you are describing and I don't know any long term druids who do either. Who I do know doing those acts is a small percentage of the druid population and they because of their acts are more memorable than Druids like myself. I was not anon or roleplay for 60 levels, I don't charge for ports, sows, or buffs and I only say no when I can't.<br>
<br>
The druids you are describing are many times alts of the non-soloing classes.... like clerics. <p>Pyne Forrester

<br>
Hybrid of the priest class with the best heals and solid buffs. Druids trade the massive healing power of clerics for other things. Or do you not know what those nukes, dots, ports, and utility spells like sow and soe are?<br>
<br>
Group heals are the paladin 'raid spells'. Only a single priest class (cleric) has spells of this type. Paladin being a hybrid of the cleric class, getting many of the same spells, are the only non cleric class to get group heals. <br>
<br>
I sacrificed a small amount of hp's and ac in my raid gear to be able to prexus 5 times a fight, if it lasts that long and i need to.  What would your sacrifice be for better healing, better dot'tage, better nukes, better ports?  <br>
<br>
<br>
"In fact, Afterlife's recruiting policy puts Necros and Magicians at a higher desirability than druids"<br>
<br>
Boo hoo. Afterlife doesnt think you are tremendously usefull. Start impressing them with your skills, and stop asking someone to do it for you. <br>
<br>
<br>
There was a time people didnt think paladin were usefull enough either. Some of the top guilds now have many of us. We have become desiarable on raids. Why? We dont have the dps of rangers, rogues, monks, warriors, and are on par with sk's. We dont have the tremendous healing power of clerics. We dont have the single target heals of even druids. Of course, it must be our best group heal and not how well people can play their character. If you cant play your character well, it doesnt matter what spells you get, you still wont be wanted. If you could play your class well, you would probably find this petition to be as laughable as others do.<br>

That isn't a valid reason. Just because it may be hard to scrounge up enough healers doesn't mean that druids should get better heals. Let's replace a few words in that statement: &quot;This is why rangers need to do more damage. Because our guild lacks rogues and monks, we are the only ones left over to do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Batou, what you are saying about druids and healing during raids tells me that you need more healers, not that the healers you have should be able to heal better.<br>
<br>
To quote Bulp:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For a normal xp grinding group a Druid is totally balanced imo.

<br>
That is the point I am trying to make. Due to the increasing availability of better and better weapons and armor, normal xp groups simply don't need the healing power they once did. Clerics are becoming known as a detriment to xp groups, not a contributor.<br>
<br>
The majority of the healing for my normal xp group comes in the form of regrowth, or regrowth of the grove. We do occasionally need to cast an actual heal spell, but over 75% of the damage I take as tank for my group gets healed with regen. A cleric would offer little to our group; they don't provide much damage output, and damage output has become the primary attribute looked for in xp groups.<br>
<br>
This is very similar to those paladins that constantly ask for /disc defensive. If paladins got it, it would 1) completely marginalize the role of the warrior and 2) break the end game. Paladins (and SKs) are much better tanks for a standard xp group than warriors are. Giving us defensive would leave warriors with absolutely no role. Due to the ease with which paladins and SKs can get and shed aggro, it would trivialize aggro management in the endgame and break the game.<br>
<br>
What you are asking for is similar, IMO. Damage output on mobs would need to be scaled up to compensate, and the role of the cleric for anything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> except</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a CH chain would be marginalized.<br>

1.  You will never beat a mage at DS<br>
2.  You will never beat a cleric at heals<br>
3.  You will never beat a Wiz at DD/AOE<br>
4.  You will never beat a Sham/Necro at DOTs<br>
5.  You will never beat a melee at any type of combat<br>
<br>
YOU ARE THE ORIGINAL UTILITY CLASS DEAL WITH IT.<br>
<br>
That is why you will never be usefull in raids because if a mage is on it your ds wont stick.  If a cleric is on the raid you wont heal etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
YOU CANT HAVE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
You have a little bit of everything which makes you the best soloer but since your not &quot;pure&quot; or the &quot;master&quot; of anything your raiding abilities diminish.<br>
<br>
BUT YOU CAN RAID!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Just hope one of the &quot;master&quot; classes are missing.  Verant made druids as that extra peice in case one is missing.<br>
<br>
LOOK AT YOUR POPULATION and tell me people don't like to play druids.<br>
<br>
YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING IN YOUR PETITION IF OU STOP SMOKING WHATEVER IT IS YOUR ON...<br>
<br>
Druids are a WATERED DOWN VERSION OF OTHER CLASSES.  Me being a shaman the first thing that pisses me off is the DOT your askin for.  my best dot if I have 15k to spend is a 1988damage bane of Knife and your asking for a 1900damage one.<br>
<br>
I DONT GIVE 2 CHITS if they stack.<br>
<br>
1.  Druids want raid abilities and DOT have nothing to do with Raids.<br>
2.  WATERED DOWN.  Everything you have is roughly 60-70 percent of what Wiz DD, Sham/Nec DOT etc are.<br>
<br>
DID YOU FAIL MATH?<br>
<br>
Your problem is YOU ARE TRYING TO JUMP OVER THAT 70 percent HURDLE.<br>
<br>
You are pissing the other classes off.  EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW THEIR ROLE.<br>
<br>
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR GETTING INTO BEFORE YOU PICK YOUR CLASS DON'T BE NIAVE(sp).<br>
<br>
I know if I pick a necro/druid ill solo great but ill have gripes getting groups.<br>
<br>
Lastly GL and keep smokin whatever it is you are. <p>Diwahabulin - 55 Shaman <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96991">Shaman Stuff</a><BR>

Graal, basically what  you are saying is that the high end raid should only consist of cleric healers.  &quot;You don't need better healing, just get more healers&quot;.  Ok so why don't we just get 20 clerics for all of our raids and forget druids all together?<br>
<br>
Not even considering that &quot;more healers&quot; means larger raids.  I guess you agree with the vision of 100 person raids for a single mob. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

<br>
Thank you Kegwell for stereotyping the entire druid class based on some issues you have with some inconsiderate asses that happen to play druids.  Guess what?  I remember the all the times a damn cleric sitting on his butt refused to rezz me because he had the same class-hate attitude you have.  I typically, as well as a good many druid friends I know, will take time out of whatever they are doing to assist other players and I resent your remarks that all druids deserve such a stereotype when they clearly don't.  <br>
<br>
Your further comments:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>
Druids do fine on raids I go to, because of the PEOPLE they are, they earned our respect and we would never consider not allowing them on a raid. Hell, who wouldn't want a utility class to help on ANY raid? Lets face it, druids are a UTILITY class. In fact, they are the original utility class.  <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
only point out your lack of understanding regarding the point.  Yes, druids are a utility class - we do not argue the point.  We are not arguing that we take part in raids - many of us do.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The point is that in most raiding situations druids are asked to assume the role of a backup healer, and that our current level of utility as a backup healer is insufficient.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We are not asking to be made clerics, we are simply asking to be able to heal in proportion to the damage being being dealt by raid level SOL mobs.  Otherwise, we no longer have the utility you discuss.<br>
<br>
I won't even go into damage dealing on raids - it's been discussed, but I will echo the fact that druids might be useful for dealing some ancillary damage, but it is generally not in line with melee/wizard damage.<br>

Let's compare this to what the petition really asks for:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  1. You will never beat a mage at DS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Don't care - not even discussed in the petition.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2. You will never beat a cleric at heals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not asking to - we are specifically asking to have our healing capability enhanced so that we can better function in raids as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  secondary healer</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, nothing more. If, as a result of raising our ability to heal, it means cleric abilities need to be adjusted upward - great, I play both.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  3. You will never beat a Wiz at DD/AOE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Again, don't care - don't want to - we are simply pointing out that our current mid-range DD/AoE capability will never get us a spot in a raid.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  4. You will never beat a Sham/Necro at DOTs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not asking to beat either, though I seriously question why our fellow priest class the shaman should have any better DoT capability than we do - they are the best stat buff and mob slowers in the game.  We are simply pointing out that while both shamans and necros get a new DoT late in life, our last DoT upgrade comes in the early 50s.  There is no reason why druids shouldn't get a DoT upgrade in the late 50s as well - I don't care if its less than the 2k dmg shaman and necros get - I think 1800/1900 is fair.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  5. You will never beat a melee at any type of combat</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I'm afraid I'm a little baffled by this one - druids do not engage in melee combat post-30 unless they are insane.  Are you implying that druids will never outdamage a melee?  That, my friend, caster balance will determine, and has nothing to do with the petition.<br>
<br>
Diwahabulin, while it was certainly interesting reading and replying to your post, I suggest that you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  1)read more carefully the topic of the post before posting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  2)go back to smoking whatever it is you accused us of smoking.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

You have said that it is OFTEN your SOLE responsibility to keep a group alive, and that ONE DRUID CAN NOT DO IT.  WELL THEN GET ANOTHER DRUID.  Christ on a crutch.  You're so set in your one little scenario where you are the only healer in a group, and you HAVE to be the only healer in a group that you can't see any other solutions to your problem other than giving you a better heal...and then you continually insult everyone else who comes up with viable solutions to your problem..because you have to be the sole healer in your group and you have to heal all damage that group takes.<br>
<br>
When you figure out that a SINGLE DRUID can not ALWAYS heal ALL damage that a group takes, you're gonna be a lot better off in the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulukasmoss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LukasmosS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/12/02 1:56:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=642>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bah</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 4.
