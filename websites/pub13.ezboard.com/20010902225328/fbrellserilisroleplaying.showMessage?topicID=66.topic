Luna<br>
Chapter 2: The Swindler<br>
<br>
I am surrounded by joy and revalry, but I do not share in the joy. How many of these people, these humans, truly serve Erollisi as I do? How many of them are just here for a good time?<br>
<br>
I am Luna, lay priestess of Erollisi. I serve her completely. On this holy day I pray that I will ascend and be named a full priestess of Erollisi. I have seen so many other ascentions. I have seen the power of Erollisi fill other women, and the miracles they have performed with this power. I hope and pray that this will be my day to ascend.<br>
<br>
I have never loved North Freeport, though I suppose it is better than East or West. It is a dirty city. A human city. To my left a fat man dances a jig, slopping beer on the ground from his overfilled stein. To my right, a pock faced girl teases some poor boy. Ahead of me, a swindler is taking silver from fools. He has a wirey frame, and steel gray hair. His garb is common, and as dirty as most. His face though strikes me as strange. His stubbly grey beard is not thick enough to hide the look of...boredom on his face. His voice is jovial, enticing passers by to try their luck, but his lips and eyes are...bored. I don't know why this interests me. Perhaps it is because I too am bored.<br>
<br>
&quot;Care to try your luck, sister?&quot; he says to me. &quot;This might be your lucky day.&quot; I ignore him. An older man watches the swindler's hands intently as he moves the cups back and forth. Four cups. One holds a silver ball, one holds gold, and two are empty. The swindler's hands stop moving, and the older man points to one cup with confidence. The swindler turns it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;My goodness, empty!&quot; proclaims the older man in shock. He lets out a belly laugh. &quot;Your hands are too fast for me.&quot; The swindler smiles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Try again sir? You may just win back your money. Four cups I move, and two are winners. Choose the silver and I'll return your silver. Choose the gold, and change your silver to gold.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You have taken enough of my money, sir,&quot; replies the older man. &quot;You are deft at your art, but I must save my money for ale!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;May Erollisi bless you, and enjoy the festival,&quot; replies the swindler with a bow. He returns to calling forth advertisments for his game.<br>
<br>
A Knight of Truth walks by with nary a glance. I glare at him disapprovingly but he seems not to see me even. How lax! They know such games are not allowed on a Holy day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Try your luck lady?&quot; asks the Swindler.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no money,&quot; I reply. It is not true. I have platinum to my name, but I would not waste it on this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then let me pay you, for a favor,&quot; he replies. His eyes twinkle a little, not so bored now. &quot;Let me buy your name.&quot; He holds out his hand, with five silver coins in it. I shrug, and take the silver from his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Luna, lay priestess of Erollisi.&quot; My mind suddenly prickles with the challenge. This rogue is good, no doubt, but elven eyes are quick. I place a silver coin on his wooden table. &quot;Go on then.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Devago,&quot; he replies smiling, &quot;and ye may have my name for free.&quot;<br>
<br>
He lifts two cups revealing the gold and silver balls. He lifts the other two revealing they are empty. His hands begin to move as he shifts the cups. Back and forth back and forth. I watch his gnarled fingers intently. How old is he? His face is wrinkled and yet strangely ageless. My mind drifts for a moment...where did the gold ball go! I curse myself for being a fool.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which cup then, M'lady?&quot; With a heavy heart I point at one... of course it isn't there. &quot;Again?&quot; I nod.<br>
<br>
I watch more intently now, focussing on the game. Why were my parents in the Karanas anyway? My father was a Paladin, perhaps his duties took him there? Damn! Where did that ball go.<br>
<br>
He is laughing at me, though his face is calm. I can see it in his eyes. He seldom has the chance to play with a Feir'dal I suppose, at least not one of high blood. I choose the wrong cup.<br>
<br>
&quot;Again!&quot; I say. My eyes watch as he moves his fingers deftly. His fingers are quick, but his tricks are simple enough to catch. Will I become a priestess today? It does not matter... focus on the cups! My mind clears, as I stare at his fingers. Everything else fades away. &quot;There!&quot; I point at the third cup. He looks at me with surpris and amusement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good my lady,&quot; he says, and lifts the cup, revealing flashing...silver? <br>
<br>
&quot;It was gold before!&quot; I assert in confusion. The silver ball was in the first cup, I knew it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I fear not M'lady, but you have won back your coin, try again?&quot; I pick up my silver, and lay down a gold. He whistles. &quot;Ah you will make a poor man of me, M'lady.&quot; His hands begin to move the cups. I focus on his hands. Hands. I remember Triena's hands, when last they touched me. No, another time. Devago's hands fill my mind. He stops. The gold is in the first, and the silver in the fourth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Which cup M'lady?&quot; I point to the fourth. He does not look amused. I knock the cup over revealing the gold ball.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep your money,&quot; I say, and turn away. &quot;But...beware the Knights of Truth.&quot; I begin to walk away but stop as I hear him laughing. It is a cruel laugh.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're no priestess,&quot; he says. I turn to him, my eyes blazing with fury. &quot;You don't even know what you are.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall I put the guards on you then?&quot; I ask. A Knight passes behind me, but does not even notice our conflict. Lazy fool.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please do,&quot; he says. I turn to the passing Knight and grab his arm. He moves as if he's dreaming, unaware even of my presence. I lose hold on him and turn to Devago.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trouble calling the guards, M'lady?&quot; he says in mock concern. &quot;Let me then.&quot; His face wrinkles in mock panic. &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; he cries out.<br>
<br>
The Knight, who only moments before was walking away, turns around sharply. Before I know what is happening he has grabbed me roughly with one hand and drawn his blade with another.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark Elf scum!&quot; he hisses. &quot;How dare you desecrate this Holy day with your presence!&quot; I put up my hand as if to ward him and catch sight of my inky black skin. The guard blinks for a moment and then shakes his head in confusion. &quot;Sister my appologies,&quot; he lowers me to the ground and sheaths his blade. &quot;Where am I...I....&quot; He lowers his head and walks away. Devago is laughing.<br>
<br>
&quot;What sorcery is this?&quot; I ask.<br>
<br>
&quot;Does it...interest you?&quot; His eyes are droll. The question is rhetorical.<br>
<br>
&quot;Such trickery is not the concern of a Priestess of Love,&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love, ah...love,&quot; says Devago. &quot;Love is such a beautiful thing, Luna, have you ever truly known Love?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My life is Love in service to Erollisi,&quot; I respond. Devago looks at me intently and I feel a sudden chill. His eyes are so cold.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will know love Luna,&quot; he says to me, smiling. &quot;Love greater than that of Erollisi. Love more powerful than mortal love. Experience then the true power of Love.&quot;<br>
<br>
I gasp as the chill turns to burn and fills my body. My arms extend and I raise my head to the sky as his power fills me. I cry out as my mind fogs, and then settles. My eyes rest on him, Devago, my lord and master. I kneel before him in subservience, take his hand in mine, and kiss his fingers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you love me, Luna?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; I cry out, &quot;completely.&quot; He laughs.<br>
<br>
