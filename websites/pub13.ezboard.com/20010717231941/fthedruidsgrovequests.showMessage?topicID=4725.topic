<br>
Anyone else having problems with the dark elf courier not spawning when you kill the necro Larik Z'vole in lesser fay? I've killed the necro 5 times now, no courier. Friend has killed him a few times, no courier. To look for him after killing the necro I immediately run to the DE camp, checking track all the time then scout around there and towards steamfont/gfay zone.<br>
<br>
I'm on Brell, and the cazic takeover has happened..maybe this has changed/broken the quest somehow?<br>

I just got the necro to spawn and I gated to steamfront zone, never once saw the courier on tracking and i ran the main path twice.  Finally parked myself at the Teir'Dal Camp to await his arrival, I at least wanted to see if he made it to the camp.. waited 20 minutes and he never showed up.<br>

I waited a month for them to fix the GD corrupted brownie and NOW THIS !!<br>

I should just go back to my newbie days of pharming crafted armor...at least it was reliable.  I'm quickly losing patience with all of our GD quests being screwed up all the time.<br>

But not since the last patch.  He does seem to spawn near Steamfont.  But I had no trouble running him down right after I killed the Necro.  So gating isn't necessary.<br>
<br>
One of the times I saw him he was at the Inkie camp and I nuked him anyway.  At level 52 not all of the DE's agro'd so I rooted or snared the ones that did ( Goon) and just ran the courier away.  Easy enough.  I'm not sure how long he will stay at the camp, or if he can deliver his package and still stay spawned.  <br>
<br>
Hope this helps, the clickable root is sweet.  I did it the second time for the dr/ pr on the second necklace, in case they ever do anything with the Karanas. <p><center>

<br>
i can see how it would look like the courier isnt spawning if there is someone waiting at his spawn place when someone else is killing the necro, that could be the problem in some cases.<br>

its nice how some druids are so willing to backstab others in their class and try to steal hours of work =) <p>-K<br>

<br>
And to the other guy, you aren't camping 2 mobs at once.  You kill one and it makes the other spawn.  The necro is the placeholder for the courier.  From my own experience and from others, the courier is no longer spawning after the necro dies and we are trying to get confirmation of that.<br>

I think it's less like BM/Fergul than it is like the skellies/ghasts.<br>

You are not triggering the courier.  You are killing a roaming PHer.<br>
<br>
If you just killed a roaming skellie PHer and someone else killed the respective ghast that spawned did you get bent out of shape?  I did not, btw, it only added to the thrill of the chase, and made a friend doing it that way.  Best tracking doggie won.<br>
<br>
I like my analogy better anyway, because it's the same quest.<br>
<br>
And if yours is closer, why don't you have a friend watching the courier like you do with Fergul?  Which is the answer to my query, &quot;how do you camp 2 different mobs at the same time&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just a difference of opinion I think.  Does not matter now anyway since it's broken.<br>

<br>
killing the courier for someone else's necro is just wrong.  how can you camp something that you yourself are not killing the trigger and or ph for.  and yes larik is the trigger for that courier once again.  *shrugs* to each his own opinion :)  you camp the necro twice, one for the necro and once for the courier, and see if you change your mind :) <p>Kiatek<BR>

You are killing a roaming PHer.&lt;<br>
<br>
the de necro is neither roaming nor a ph.  the courier is neither roaming nor a ph.  the necro is a STATIC spawn who has his own static ph (mummies or skeletons in one particular spawn point at the obelisk).  the courier is a TRIGGERED spawn and comes from only one particular spawn point and has a specific path that is the same every single time he spawns.<br>
<br>
here is a more druidic analogy for you:  you have been camping the tainted barracuda for 6 hours.  it pops and you kill it and the corrupt spawns.  as soon as you kill it, someone standing beside you screams that they are camping the corrupt barracuda and starts to kill the corrupt barracuda that you just TRIGGERED by the death of the tainted.  this is identical to the situation with the necro/courier (static rare mob with ph whose death triggeres a second mob), only exception being that the courier's spawn point is specific and not the death point of the necro, as the corrupts is to the tainted.<br>
<br>
now how many people given THAT situation would sit back and say &quot;gee, you are camping it, go ahead!&quot;?? <p>-K<br>

Mybad.<br>
<br>
When I did this long ago, the courier spawned at a completely different spot in the zone, and then ran to the camp.<br>
<br>
He did not spawn *immediately* after the necro died.  And definately not in the same spot, like the tainted/corrupteds do.<br>
<br>
And to answer the poster about &quot;doing it twice&quot;.  I did(three times, really), not like it makes any difference now.<br>
