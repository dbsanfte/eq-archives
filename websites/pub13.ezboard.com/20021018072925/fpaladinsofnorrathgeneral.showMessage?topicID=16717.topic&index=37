Scott coming here and acknowledging our concerns is worth thanks. It shows that Verant does pay attention to this board and the concerns stated here. Plus it's just common courtesy.<br>
<br>
Being cranky about it just tends to get you ignored. You get more flies with honey than you do with vinegar.<br>

And thanks Scott for the update.

<br>
as customers, asking for the bugs to be fixed is the wrong thing; it is the failure in the systematic process (or lack thereof) which permitted bugs to reach the live server that should be examined.<br>
<br>
by asking simply for bugfixes, we are setting ourselves up for more bugs in the future.  i, for one, would rather avoid such short-sightedness.<br>
<br>
i would rather ask scott specifically what changes have been made (not 'are being made' or 'could be made') to the QA process that will keep bugs similar to all those found in the most recent patch from reaching us again.<br>
<br>
getting a bug fixed is not a victory; by then it has already been inflicted upon us.  it's only a consolation.<br>
<br>
<br>
as for thanks, we each thank verant every month (or in lump sums once a year).  there's no reason to voice it here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukethlar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kethlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/30/02 1:34:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16717.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ok wait a minute...</span><hr size=1> Since its confirmed that VI reps do read this board...does that mean that they are IGRNORING us on purpose?

Does this indeed confirm that VI couldnt care a damn about paladins?  I still have yet to see VI address why they gave clerics super uber hammers and druids near complete heals and not to mention that VI hasn't said one peep about people complaints that MONKS/ROGUES and to a smaller degree RANGERS are all TOO UBER and overpowered in melee combat.  What about the mitigation issues with AC?  None of these have been answered or addressed or even commented on.  Does that mean VI doesn't care?  hmm the logical conclusion is yes, VI doesn't care.  VI SHOULD fix errors in game where THEY SCREWED up in the first place and we should not be thanking them for screwing something up so that they need to fix it.  We didnt screw it up, VI did in the first place so why thank them?  Are paladins so beat down now that they will thank VI over something that they did wrong in the first place?  Thank VI when they fix &quot;real&quot; issues and &quot;problems&quot; and not because they fixed something THEY SCREWED UP IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!<br>

I'm getting sick and tired of VI's PR practices.  Makes me think of them as politicians  GRRRR<br>

Since the other party only gives feedback on stuff they already screwed up and fixed and ignores issues that are blatant and gushing with puss all over, that means they could care less about the festering wound.  They will only fix what they think is appropriate, and this leads me to think that they could care less of what paladins think of as &quot;class balancing&quot;.<br>

<br>
No, it's called &quot;time management&quot; and &quot;pick your battles&quot;.<br>
<br>
They aren't here to get involved in flame wars or debates where one paladin can't agree with another paladin. In general, they'll read a lot and use ideas that they like or think will be helpful.<br>
<br>
Ie., they'll read a lot and say a little.<br>
<br>
Only reason Scott posted was because we demanded an answer, and because he felt he should post it. He could have noted the problem, fixed it, and had Absor mention it in the next patch (assuming Absor remembered <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), but that's bad CS. Good CS is to say &quot;It's being fixed now&quot;, and fix it.<br>
<br>
I can guarantee you they've seen our posts on the balancing forum. How much credence they give it, in the scheme of things, I don't know. At the same point, from having talked to Scott in person at the Boston Fan Faire (hi Scott, I'm the one who thanked you about the healing penalty and asked about bow skill caps), they're reworking a lot of the game and trying to rebalance it at the same time. Scott and his crew are a very busy bunch of folks.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that the team working on EQ now is mostly a new crew. They're going in and fixing a lot of the very broken shit that has caused problem after problem in the system for so long. They're trying to fix things one thing at a time while trying to break as little else in the process. Bad things will happen; the alternative is to deal with the system exactly as it stands right now. I don't consider that acceptable, and from the impression I got when I talked to him, neither do they.<br>
<br>
Scott's opinions, insofar as I was able to determine what they were, show a lot of rational thinking and reflect a lot of what players have said all along-- not &quot;The Vision&quot;. Exactly how much that impacts the game remains to be seen, but honestly, he's a guy I respect and trust. A lot more so than Abashi or Absor.<br>

I'm a developer so I understand that developers can get caught up in their work.  But I'm not flaming the developers for not letting us know what they are doing.  What I am flaming is VI's PR or marketing department or Customer Relations department that have done a very very poor job at maintaning quality control and keeping their customers in the loop of what's going on.  As you know because of various scandals from big corps just these past months, most of their problems festered from keeping things secret and not revealing to their customers what was going on.  This kind of business practices promotes degeneration in the community building process and seriously degrades the establisment of &quot;trust&quot; that implicitly exists between customers andt their supplier.  A customer should be informed of what they are buying or if there are changes to the product that they bought, a &quot;warranty&quot; insures that they will be notified of said changes or else.  <br>
<br>
But again, Jas if VI had just said what you said now a while back or just said little bits here and there to assure the EQ community at large most people would be complaining less and things would just generally be more peaceful.<br>

We can't expect them to respond to every issue though.  They would be spending all day on this chat board and not working if they did that.  <br>
<br>
Also, if any of you remember the days when VI had their own message board where we could all post and they would respond, these discussions often ended up with VI trying to explain themselves followed by lots and lots of really nasty bitter replies from players (ring any bells?).<br>
<br>
I'm all for more openness and communication--I'd like to hear what they have to say on the stun aggro issue and some of the other longstanding questions and issues we've discussed here.  Asking or demanding a response to every little thing is going too far IMO. <p><BR>

I'll admitt that its a small difference, but there is a difference there.  Of course they should fix the bugs they introduced - none of us are going to argue against that.<br>
<br>
As far as rolling parts of the code back and forth, it would be a nightmare with the amount of code and coders working on it.  I'll agree that their QA is lacking, but its hard to say what kind of bugs would be introduced by rolling parts of the code back instead of rolling all of it back.  It would also necessitate additional downtime as well as the downtime they'll have when they bring the servers down to patch everything they broke.  The whole thing is a bad design but rolling the code back might make things even worse.  That's all I was getting at.<br>
<br>
As far as the balance comments, who's to say what they do take from this and other boards as ideas.  I don't think they try and discuss ideas with people on the boards anymore.  As soon as they talked to us about ideas, the boards here would be swamped with representatives of every other class flooding the threads with wizards need this ..., clerics still can't get groups ..., rogues still can't invis from zone to zone ...., etc....   - pick your favorite class and rant and it would show up here and they'd be chased away.  <br>
<br>
Instead, we bicker amongst ourselves and they get to see what we think overall as a collective.  Its nowhere near as constructive as it could be, but at least they get to see our opinions.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think they do take ideas from boards like this.  I also think its nice to see them post things related to our class when they can.  I wish there was more of an interaction, but truthfully its tough (and this is coming as someone who is part of a game writing company) to go and talk about game changes with the players when you always end up with several people who feel being rude, obnoxious and / or demanding is the best way to get your attention.  This happened to them alot with the old boards they ran.  The level of noise was so high that it was nearly impossible to pick out the truly constructive dialog.  I'll admitt that my opinions in this matter have changed too - mostly since trying to deal with the players of the games I work on and they're considerably smaller than EQ. <p>Kleitus <br>

<br>
disgruntled, angry and offensice players may be why VI is holding back.<br>
But on the other side, if you don't shake the tree you can't expect to get the fruits.<br>
<br>
The funny thing to me is that, while now everybody seems happy this turned out to be a bug I am still not happy with the status quo of a LoH that heals less HP at level 60, than I have unbuffed!<br>
<br>
The point for me is that VI changed the game play, to keep the players online hey added new zones, mobs, items...<br>
To make it interesting they made the mobs tougher (faster, more HP, hitting harder, higher AC...) but our epics, our powers remained at the level of Antonica, or Kunark at best. Velious turned FD into a torch, and now with Luclin and PoP coming it is even less.<br>
With new spells, new buffs, new items, the LoHs relative value has gone down the drain.<br>
<br>
Imho this should have been adjusted upwards ling ago. Either by increasing the HP healed per level (with 50hp per level I would still not heal myself full up at lvl 60, even unbuffed) to about 60 or 70HP (or use a level dependent calculation that would yield 4kp heal at lvl 60) or reduce the reuse time from currently 72 min to a third or a quarter of the time.<br>
<br>
Monks' mend, is usable every 3.9 minutes I believe, which is about 18.5 times in 72 minutes, so actually it heals many times more. I think it heals about 1/3 of what LoH does, so in total the healing amounts to 6 times moe HP in the same time.<br>
Agreed, it is self only and comparrissons hink, but the difference is still astounding ato mention and was ment to show how relative a LoH is.<br>
<br>
So either increase LoH efficienz by about 45% at high levels<br>
Or better (so the points invested in AA for CH versio nof LoH make more of a difference) triple the frequency of LoH down to a 24 min refresh (still only meaning half as many HPs healed as per mend over same period. <p><div align="center"><font size="2"><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Drachan

God verant I'm willing to bet every corperation in the U.S.A. would love to learn how you do it.  Your own customers will beat up on any other customer of yours who voices complaints about you.  Wow <br>
