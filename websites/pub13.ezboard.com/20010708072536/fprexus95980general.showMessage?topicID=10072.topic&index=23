<br>
I think Verant customer service does some things well (given the compromise between the high needs for service and the budge $10/month allows where they have to use guides), and some things very badly that need improvement.<br>
<br>
But the difference is, I can say which specific things I think need improvement; they're reasonable issues, such as the fact that they announced a policy that you reporting your account hacked will get it banned even if you were not at fault - which may be a small percentage of times, but nonetheless it's wrong.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand right nonsense here:<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 1: There are no bugs.&quot;<br>
Verant admits they have bugs. You are wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 2: If you report a bug you are either lieing, a cheater, or a hacker. So reporting a bug means we ban you.&quot;<br>
Verant encourages the reporting of bugs, and they fix many from customer reports. Wrong again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 3: We are not responsible for any of our coding, we are perfect and never make mistakes and being the al powerful wizard of oz, err Verant we can do as we please. &quot;<br>
Verant says they are responsible for their coding. They admit they aren't perfect.<br>
<br>
The real problem are the few customers who just throw mud no matter what and ruin the Verant-customer relationship, like your post. It's why they ended the discussion on their message forums.<br>
<br>
Try not to throw temper tantrums at Verant - it won't help anyone.<br>

<br>
Thank you for your email. While I wholeheartedly understand<br>
the frustration in losing items, as I explained in game, your corpse decayed while your account was logged on. Please note that the corpse timer will continue to count down at the online rate if you are online with any character on the account. I am sorry to be the barer of bad news but as per our reimbursement policy posted at everquest.station.sony.co.../index.jsp we are unable to restore your corpse. If you have any further questions please feel free to email me.<br>
<br>
<br>
And again: <br>
He camped out 1 or 2 hours after the death. (Yes, he camped, he didn't /q)<br>
He logged on 2 days later with a Necro to summon his corpse (he didn't go to chat or played a twink, this was the 1st time, he logged the account back on), Kirak was even expecting to be able to get the exp back with a rez. No corpse there and the GM tells him, it decayed exactly 24 hours after the death...<br>
<br>
Ok, the account stayed online, though Kirak camped out. A problem of his ISP? Hard to believe. <br>
A problem at Verant? Gotcha !<br>
<br>
We had many situations, where the CS didn't help us a bit. This one is one too much. What the hell do they loose, if they restore his character? He didn't die in VP or some zone like that, he died in the Tower of Frozen Shadows. Quite easy to get his corpse out of that zone. He justed camped after he died, because it was late and he had to work the next day.<br>
<br>
I am sick of all this &quot;the player is guilty, unless he (or she) can proof he isn't&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
We are a small guild. We are more like a family. We meet each other 2 or 3 times in a year. Kirak is always willing to help others. If such a nice person looses everything due to a problem, he has no influence upon, it is a horrible situation for our whole guild. Sure we could get his stuff again quite fast, but that isn't the point. He cancelled his account due to the fact, that he got NO HELP AT ALL from the Verant-CS. He is tired. So are we as a guild.<br>
<br>
We still have some things, we will try. If all that doesn't help, I am afraid, you won't see many &quot;Ringers&quot; in EQ anymore.<br>

<br>
Its a tad outdated because this was before the 3 minute empty corpse poof was removed.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Level 1 - 5:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 30 minutes<br>
Level 6+: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
*Note:  If you have no items on your corpse, it will decay in 3 minutes regardless of level.  It is best advised to get your corpse right away.  If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game.  Also, be advised that your corpse decay is still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account.<br>

If there was a bug due to some gaming code..then we should not be held responsable for it.. Eq is a game where acquiring an item may take months and even years to get.. and then all of a sudden the quest npc dont work due to bugs and all u get is a response from a gm saying &quot;read the policy&quot;.  Sure i understand why they would make such a policy but the fact is verant just decided to fook the customer they acquired over thw years cuz they know they can get away with it...<br>

Actually, now naked corpses stay three hours with nothing on them if you are over a certain level (not sure whether that is the 6+ level or if they made it over level 50, but I think it's the 6+ level). After you resurrect the naked corpse it poofs. (Just did one today for a guildmate who died in Iceclad porting in then died again porting in second time to get her first corpse - can that be the most stupid/dangerous place to port in? Things are always roaming through there). <p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=1 width="50%">

<br>
The 24 hours becomes pro rated too, 12 hours online + 3 1/2 days offline = max time allowed.<br>
<br>
Many, many people die and think, 'to hell with it, I've had enough tonight, I'll get it later, ... let me see... which twink shall I play ?'<br>
<br>
Many younger players share accounts with family members, and when they log of their character, the other logs on.<br>
Same account, same time online.<br>
<br>
Guides and GM's do not enjoy telling people that they have nothing left, its one of the worst things you have to tell someone. Policys are strict, but the GM does have a little leeway. Remember that over every GM (server GM), is a Lead GM (A few servers) and so on.<br>
<br>
They are all accountable to someone further on up the line.<br>
<br>
Follow it thru, e mail again, but be really sure that no one was on your account, in fact, ask them to tell you which character was logged in and where.<br>
Our GM's are pretty good, persevere, its not instant, a character restore is a lot of work, and takes time.<br>
