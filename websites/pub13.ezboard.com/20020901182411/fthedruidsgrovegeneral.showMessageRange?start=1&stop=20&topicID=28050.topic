<br>
I post on the Druids Grove with my own, first hand knowledge and in-game experiance.  Please allow me to define myself a bit.<br>
<br>
--I have been playing EQ since the day of release.<br>
<br>
--My main character is a lvl 57 druid with 67 days played.<br>
<br>
--I play on Veeshan.  One of the original servers with easily 5+ &quot;tier 1&quot; guilds, and 15+ &quot;tier 2&quot; guilds.<br>
<br>
--I belong to a &quot;tier 2&quot;, casual guild with the majority of mains being lvl 60 with epics.  Most twinks and secondaries are 50+.  We average about 50-60 people on every night.<br>
<br>
--I have been engaging regularly in &quot;tier 2&quot; encounters since I was lvl 50.  I have attended several &quot;tier 1&quot; encounters at lvl 54+ as well.<br>
<br>
--I group primarily with my guildmates, which includes an extremely large selection of classes and lvls, but are generally 50+.  If there is no room for me, I'll solo or do pick-up groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that we have that information out of the way, and you know where I am coming from, I have something to say to the many &quot;bitter druids&quot; that I seem to butt heads with on this msg board.  I would like to say that I am really getting tired of my in-game experiances and knowledge getting batted aside as a VAK or as just being passed off as an idiot.<br>
<br>
I made a point in a previous thread that my group of druids out pulled and out killed the other 5 groups of guildmates in SF while waiting for Rage to pop.  I also made a point that I was in an AoE group in Chardok that would put any cookie cutter group to shame.  Broom passed these off as unrealistic and uncommon, and followed up with her opinion that druids are not wanted for AoE groups, rendering my whole argument invalid.<br>
<br>
I got news for all you druids that think along these same lines:  I am not provoking a reaction.  I am not trying to make things seem better than they are.  I am not making stuff up or trying to skew encounters in my favor versus your complaint/opinion.  I am simply posting what I do and how I play whenever I am in an experiance group in EverQuest.  I do not seek out particular situations or groups.  I take what I can get and what is available in the timeframe that I can play.<br>
<br>
Here are my views and reasoning on various druid abilities that are in constant discussion on this board.<br>
<br>
Healing:<br>
<br>
Perhaps the single largest complaint lately is our lack of healing ability.  I do not have a problem healing in the 50+ game of EQ.  I have standard groups, in standard situations.  Sometimes, I have really odd groups in really odd situations as well, but somehow, everything comes together.  It dosen't matter if I'm in Velks (choose your area), Seb, HS, Chardok, GE, KS, HoT, Keal, WW, CT, UP, Akheva, ME, FG, Grey, SD, or any of the other exp zones in this game.  I simply do not have a problem.  Maybe this is because I can count the number of times I have been the main healer in a 6 man exp group without mana regen on one hand.  <br>
The fact is, no matter what the group is, there seems to be another class present that assists me in my role of healing enough for me to easily make do, or even excel in my healing role.  Monks have % heal, Shaman have slow and topor, bards/enchanters give me awsome mana regen, Pallies can group heal and top off HP's along with can Rangers and BLs, Sks can lifetap, Necros can lifetap and group heal, rogues can evade, warriors can bandage, mages can summon focus items and help burn MoBs faster, ect. ect. ect.  Furthermore, 2 druids in a group is a symphony of skill that can work awsome together balancing DDs, DoTs, root parking, and healing.  Three druids is even better.  More nukes please!  I know, because I frequently end up in druid only exp groups due to the large number of druids in my guild.<br>
So, I can't keep the MA healed while fighting the AoW.  Big deal. It's simply not my job.  I can easily keep my group alive with full raid buffs combined with thier own class abilities in both &quot;tier 1&quot; and &quot;tier 2&quot; encounters.<br>
<br>
So, you can tell me over and over and over again about why we suck, how we are broken, and I simply will not believe it.  Not based upon my supposed rose tinted glasses, but based upon the game I play every day.  My personal experiance &gt; What you tell me.  You will never convice me that I am worthless.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do I have problems with the druid class?  Yes I do.  But those problems pale in comparision with how happy I am with the druid class.  I feel the end game lacks a varied amount of DRU only loot.  I feel many of our spells are too rare.  My main complaint is how druids are precieved to be less valuable than a cleric when raid loot drops.  I don't like that our DoTs kinda petered out after WD.  I don't like the fact that people stereotype druids.  I don't like feeling like a port whore for guild raids...get there early like I did, dammit!  And I certianly don't like to see a druid msg board with so many players that perpetuate the stereotype that druids are useless.  Limit yourself, but pease do not force your limitations on me.<br>

<br>
At that level I was still extremely happy with my druid abilities too. Even at 60 when we were still doing HoT I was very happy with our abilities. And even now, I still love my druid, but I'm not going to stick my head in the sand and chant all is well in order not to offend anyone. Something is wrong with a game when there are multiple classes that can do everything except play the main healer in an experience group. I still believe that druids are great for grouping, but only as backup healers and damage dealers. But you get the group larger than six (like raids), and druids are unneaded. Since I have started playing, druids have gone from one of the most powerful classes in the game, to one of the classes that no one would even notice missing. Will I keep playing my druid with no improvements? Probably. Will I keep my mouth shut and say everything is just fine? Nope.<br>
<br>
I'm happy you are happy. You should just realize that most of those complaining here are people that love the class which is the reason their character isn't a port bot like so many post 50 druids have become. People here aren't complaining because they think druids suck, they are complaining because they see our skills being slowly chipped away and want to turn it around. Anyone that has a high level druid and two computers can have a high 50s of any other class very quickly, and many do. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ul1ndara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L1ndara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 2:17:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28050.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Profile of a Happy a Druid</span><hr size=1> &quot;I made a point in a previous thread that my group of druids out pulled and out killed the other 5 groups of guildmates in SF while waiting for Rage to pop.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Yeah and my 51 cleric before faithstone/manastone was outpulling/killing groups in SF SOLO, of course they didn't know we were in a race at the time.<br>
 <br>
  Aside from the obvious fact that druids can solo quad more than a meleer can kill and a group of druids that couldn't outkill anything but an AE group or an equal or greater number of wizards are a bunch of gits, this makes a really lousy argument.<br>
 <br>
&quot;I also made a point that I was in an AoE group in Chardok that would put any cookie cutter group to shame. Broom passed these off as unrealistic and uncommon, and followed up with her opinion that druids are not wanted for AoE groups, rendering my whole argument invalid.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Druids don't get invited to these groups, it IS uncommon.  Druids are NOT a good AE group candidates.  If you have ANY idea of the AE wizards and mages have or the benefits of having a good puller like a bard or an additional enchanter to keep mobs very locked down you'd know druids make very bad choices for AE groups.  Did you know clerics have the upheaval line druids have AND a second line of AE AND (albeit bad) clicky AE?  They ALSO have group heals, faster casting heals, DA, better AC, and fear.  Putting a druid in an AE group over a wizard, mage, enchanter, cleric or bard is doing a huge favour to the druid and not the group.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Furthermore, 2 druids in a group is a symphony of skill that can work awsome together balancing DDs, DoTs, root parking, and healing. Three druids is even better.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Outside of quadding druids have CRAP sustained DPS.  Having druids in your group brings down your XP rate unless they're KEIed and barded or have Vex tunics.<br>
 <br>
&quot;My main complaint is how druids are precieved to be less valuable than a cleric when raid loot drops. I don't like that our DoTs kinda petered out after WD. I don't like the fact that people stereotype druids.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Druids are less valuable than clerics when raid loot drops.  CH is broken, druids are not.<br>
 <br>
  If you want to play a DOT class, start a shaman or necro, druids aren't it.<br>
 <br>
  I don't like how people sterotype druids either.  They think because for the first 30 levels or so they can be primary healers that it's still true by 60 and it's not.  If you want to be a healer start a cleric or shaman.  If you want to toss nukes play a wizard or druid.<br>

Continue living in Fairweather world all you'd like Mr. Pure, that does not change the fact that the Druid class doesn't not match up with the game or the other classes in the high end game.<br>
<br>
The arguments have been made repeatedly.  I have no compulsion to repeat them again.  The facts are out there, continue to ignore them at your pleasure. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">

<br>
I have one level 60 with 150 days played and zero alts. All I play is my Druid and have since day one.<br>
<br>
I love my Druid and I am fine in a single group but this is what happened last night:<br>
<br>
I was the sole healer in a caster group in ToV out of 7 groups. Our group was a support group in which our sole function was to provide mod-rods and other such support.<br>
<br>
While I do not consider myself a uber Druid I do not think that I suck either *smiles*.<br>
<br>
With a full set of buffs and with the group in ROTG and even using Nature's Recovery to help I could not keep my group alive due to the wicked AOE spells from the dragons.<br>
<br>
Even with mod-rods and C3 I ran out of mana halfway during the battle. Perhaps those in my group did not have enough resists or perhaps the mobs were being pulled too fast but I could not even keep casters alive who were taking nothing more than AOE damage!<br>
<br>
With FM and against one mob I could do it but after while the Clerics were still at half mana I was OOM.<br>
<br>
Welcome to the high end game.<br>
<br>
The sole purpose our group had was to try and stay alive through the crap pulls in order to get to the Dragon.<br>
<br>
Our group wiped twice and the other pulls often resulted in one or two members getting killed. The raid was never wiped.<br>
<br>
This would be normal but we ONLY took AOE damage.<br>
<br>
When a Druid cannot even keep a group alive from AOE damage then something is seriously wrong.<br>
<br>
And before people tell me "I'm a Druid and I can keep my group alive just fine so you just suck"<br>
<br>
Do I really? Can you keep your group alive while they all take 300 damage every minute? It goes like this:<br>
<br>
Pull Mob 1<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
Heal Player 1 for 400<br>
Heal Player 2 for 400<br>
Heal Player 3 for 400<br>
Heal Player 4 for 400<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
Heal Player 5 for 400<br>
Heal player 6 for 400<br>
Heal player 1 for 400<br>
Heal Player 2 for 400<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
<br>
Repeat a few times<br>
<br>
Mob Dead<br>
Druids at 20m<br>
Clerics at 60m<br>
Med/rebuff/res dead tanks<br>
Clerics at 100m<br>
Druids at 70m<br>
<br>
Pull Mob 2<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
Heal Player 1 for 400<br>
Heal Player 2 for 400<br>
Heal Player 3 for 400<br>
Heal Player 4 for 400<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
Heal Player 5 for 400<br>
Heal player 6 for 400<br>
Heal player 1 for 400<br>
Heal Player 2 for 400<br>
Group takes 300 damage<br>
<br>
Repeat a few times<br>
<br>
Mob Dead<br>
Druids at 0m<br>
Clerics at 60m<br>
Med/rebuff/res dead tanks<br>
Clerics at 100m<br>
Druids at 40m<br>
<br>
See the trend?<br>
<br>
Because the mobs respawn at a certain rate a Raid Leader CANNOT slow down or mobs will repop on you and the raid will wipe.<br>
<br>
This is healing ONLY casters and ONLY AOE damage. I'm not talking about healing tanks taking serious melee damage. In fact if your raid gets adds you will have a hard time just keeping yourself alive - forget about your group!<br>
<br>
It boils down to this....<br>
<br>
Should a Level 60 Druid be able to keep their group alive on a high level raid with C3, 200+ resists, and full buffs when the group is ONLY taking AOE damage?<br>
<br>
Currently we can but only with downtime between pulls - there is little or no downtime between pulls on these raids!<br>
<br>
If wanting to keep a caster group alive from AOE damage or having a "real" raid role makes me bitter then I am only bitter because I used to be able to help my group (in fact I do just fine in solo exp groups).<br>
<br>
Should Verant just come out and say - Druids are not designed for high level raids?<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>

No offense because I really dont mean any...

that's it simply put, it's ok to be content with your class, and i applaud you. but there are those of us that aren't, and i'd like to see some improvement, i hope i haven't ever said your opinions aren't valid, but honestly you simply haven't experienced the game that most of us are bitter about. heck, i haven't experienced a good chunk of it, cuz i can't get into a tier one guild, due to my class.<br>

i feel like im at an aa meeting.<br>
<br>
hi, my name is kallinn, and im a happy druid.<br>
<br>
i actually AM a happy druid.  i am also an officer of a tier 1 guild, with 285 days played, since that seems so important to lend credence to words.<br>
<br>
i giggle when i hear people talk about not being able to play primary healer in ssra groups, because i have done so.  i had a chanter for mana regen and haste, two pallies for backup healing one of which was the puller/tank, and two other melee.  the pallies topped the group off during downtime, and i kept us up during fights.  it was scary, it was challenging, it was great.  i also recognize that it was atypical of what a druid is able to do in that zone, so i dont hold up my experience as the benchmark for our class.<br>
<br>
being a happy druid has little to do with whether you think our skills are sufficient.  it has to do with the type of person you are.  those with negative personalities are going to express themselves negatively over the same set of circumstances and the same feelings as someone who is of a more positive personality.<br>
<br>
im happy, yet i realize we have serious shortcomings that do not allow us to play our given roles.  we are substandard in the high end raid department, as are several classes.  ive long had a beef with the lack of high end druid gear, and while i believe druids are as deserving as clerics for gear, i also realize that cleric mana is way more important than druid mana when it comes down to it (and perhaps we may see a change in this after balancing is done, i hope).<br>
<br>
so be gentle to our bitter brethren.  they obviously feel enough misery in their druidic life that we dont need to add to it by being mean to them   =P <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19646">-K</a><br>

I am not in a &quot;Tier 1&quot; Guild, nor would I ever want to be. I play for fun. I play a lot (probably 30 hours a week average) but I really don't care to do HUGE encounters that require heaps of people. A few smaller raids are fine with me, and I have few complaints about our class in that situation. Not trying to deflate any of the &quot;bitter&quot; arguments for high-end raiding - I agree, there are glaring problems that need to be dealt with. But me, personally - I am happy with the Druid class for my own playstyle of experience groups and smaller scale raids. I have a blast.<br>
<br>
Cassea, I was just in HoT as the healer for our group - we weren't strictly backup, we were addin damage. Group consisted of a Mage, Ranger, 2 Rogues, and 2 Druids - though the other Druid had to leave about half-way through the raid. Didn't have problem one healing my group from the AE's. Got a little crazy at times, one fellow got down to like 40 hp before a Chloroblast hit, but we did fine. I had enough mana to nuke about half the time, and we ended up getting the xp there for about 33% of the overall raid. If you are the sole healer in your group in HoT and everyone is taking 300 damage from the AE's....sounds like the people in your group need more levels/resists. Sometimes we took full damage, but most of the time it was partial or resisted outright by a few people. As Fairweather said, I wasnt tryin to heal the Main Tank - not my role there (though I did toss a few patches in from time to time) - I was just content to make sure my group didnt die; which I was easily able to do. <br>

I dont play twinks, i love my class, actually take alot of pride in playing a Druid.  I enjoy the druid community here, and despite the impression people have that i'm some bitter, constantly negative druid, i'm only this bad on the boards.  Why?  Because this is a place where we can discuss our issues, where people can relate to the same issues i have, and where we can agree to an extent when we're broken.  There are alot of Druids in EQ, but many that arent as knowledgable as the ones that frequent here, even then most of us seem to know our class pretty well and act more maturely.<br>
<br>
Your more than welcome to argue my points Silly Eskimo, and i agree i've been somewhat harsh at times, but it gets frustrating when you have people throwing rare instances in your face constantly in terms of your abilities and acting as though they are as important.  This is done by every other class in terms of our evacs, ports, etc. and act as though they make up for our everyday grouping inequities.  They do nothing for me when i'm trying to get a group in OS.  Then when you have another Druid doing the same thing constantly and arguing against their own class, it gets frustrating.<br>
<br>
You may be content, but there are many more than you that arent obviously.  Good for you taht your content, but dont presume that everyone else should feel the same as you.  You even stated you have issues with some things, but you'd rather just have them work it out at some point in the future.  When?  if your not proactive, none of those changes will ever take place.  Why do you see the negativity?  Because many of us arent happy and want something done.  I'm not the only one complaining, there seem to be alot more everyday.  <br>
<br>
I mean you have to understand why when your telling us not to be negative, and only post positive stuff here, that it annoys people right?  I'm not censoring your viewpoints, i'm simply arguing them.  Its like the happy-go-lucky guy telling everyone else to be like him.  I'm sorry but i dont wanna be happy-go-lucky when we have issues.  I want those issues addressed as soon as possible.  You may not experience what i experience, just like the uber druid might be perfectly happy right now, but i know what i experience day in and day out sitting at zoneline trying to get a group.  Then resorting to forming my own groups because i've been sitting there for more than an hour(at least bazaar channel makes things better).  Its annoyinig to see lower lvl clerics and shamans being picked up before you despite the fact taht you've been sitting there for twice as long.  Sure, i'll beat out any lower lvl druid, but not a Shaman or Cleric for a healing role.  I'm definitely not being picked up for dps, but already went over that.<br>
<br>
Anyways, its a matter of perspective i guess.  For example those players who dont pickup group and just raid probably dont see what i see, nor do they care.  It doesnt affect them, thats why you'll see many people only thinking we need raiding improvements because thats all they might do.  Some guilds may only allow a certain number of druids on raids so an important ability may mean more to them.  Personally, i'm content with our raiding role other than feeling we could use a group heal, then again my guild will take as many classes as they can get for most events.  Its all a matter of perspective i guess, but i do know we need some fixing or improvements in terms of desirability in general.  I believe everything we mentioned in our petition in terms of the watering down of our abilities w/o compensation are facts that cant be disputed.  I know sitting at zoneline being passed up for lower lvl Shamans and Clerics gets annoying after so many times.  So maybe you'll understand where i'm coming from when i state points about our lack of desirability.  I experience it day in and day out, and i'd rather be proactive about it and get something done than wait for Verant to realize its an issue at some point down the line~  <br>
<br>
Its really nothing personal, but its just frustrating sometimes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=falamilwoodhelven>Falamil Woodhelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Just got my shots!</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 4:37:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28050.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bitter druid</span><hr size=1> My druid DoTs really help up the DPS of my bard..........<br>

I think you hit the nail on the head. Those most vocal (for the most part) are the ones who play a Druid as a main or only (me!)<br>
<br>
I will play a Druid till my very last day in EQ.<br>
<br>
Whether that is for another month or another few years depends solely on Verant at this point.<br>
<br>
As far as the comment about healing in ToV from another poster. I did not have a backup healer in the group. It was just me and it was a hard hitting fast strike raid with little downtime. Those who have been a part of such a raid know what I am talking about.<br>
<br>
As far as those 300 damage AOE. I had well over 200 in resists and I was taking the damage myself so it was not a resist issue as much as it was just an uber mob. For sure I resisted many of the attacks but enough got through that I was left drained of mana after a single pull. As soon as an add hit (what raid never gets adds) I was standing there (you can't even sit to med) helpless as I watched my group die and I could do nothing but watch C3 tick up my mana pixel by pixel until I could cast a single heal on one of the six in my party. Those high ratio shamen and cleric HoT's and group heals take over in the high end raid game and that is what pushed Druids to 4th place in healing abilities on these raids. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

I have played every other class, but druid is the onlyone i truely like (havent tried wiz to hard yet)... but i agree i would like more indoor spells, and more heals (or better heals).<br>
