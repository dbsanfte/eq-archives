remember, Sunshu has been there for me.  First as a friend, then later, as we grew older, we grew closer.<br>
<br>
Sunshu was a quiet child, who grew into a quiet. thoughtful man.  He took his studies with the 'Silen Fist Clan' very seriously.<br>
<br>
Our skills complemented each other, using fist and sword, voice and discipline, we formed a fighting force that many considered 'otherworldly.'  Our bond was so deep, we knew exactly what the other would do at any given moment.<br>
<br>
Sunshu had always been my opposite.  He has always been the one that stands back and merely observes the happenings of the world around him.  And he would fall back upon the teachings of the 'Silent Fist Clan' to help him make his decisions.  While I was usually the one rushing headlong into a situation, that at the time seemed a good idea.  Often Sunshu was the one that would get me out of my messes.<br>
<br>
The same night I received the letter from my mother, Sunshu had been invited to a meeting for young monks.  It was being held at the Clan house, but there were special speakers expected to be there.  Members of the Zan Fi Monks had requested that all young monks come to the guild house, to hear the teachings of the Ways of Tranquility and the True Path.<br>
<br>
Sunshu was very excited about the meeting, it was one of his greatest desires to be a member of the Zan Fi Monks and walk in the footsteps of the Sensei Jagriel.  All day he had talked about tonight's meeting, if he hadn't talked about leaving Qeynos also, I would have been excited also.<br>
<br>
I hated to think of our eventual separation, but I knew I had no right to ask Sunshu to stay.  I had never thought of leaving with him, and the few battle songs I knew weren't very inspiring.<br>
<br>
When Eve gave me my mother's letter my first thought was of Sunshu.  I wanted him there beside me, I wanted him to read the words that would change my life.<br>
<br>
When I got to the monk guildhall, Selma  told me that Sunshu was in the practice yard, awaiting the Teacher from the Zan Fi Monks.  She suggested that I join him to listen to the words of Quellious.  She thought the Words of Tranquility would calm me, as she could see that I was upset.<br>
<br>
Going into the training area, I saw the largest gathering of monks I had ever seen.  Not only was Sunshu there, but ten others, all close to Sunshu's age.  Some I recognized from my earlier visits here, some I had never seen before.<br>
<br>
I sat beside Sunshu, who had taken a seat near the wall and to the back of the crowd.  I handed him the letter, and after he read it we spoke quietly about the words written within it.  We didn't want anyone to over hear my mother's words.  We were afraid some wouldn't understand.  Before the Zan Fi entered I hopped onto a low wall beside the door of the guildhall, trying to stay out of the way, should there be any demonstrations.<br>
<br>
Three monks quietly walked out of the rooms where the Guild leader of the 'Silent Fist Clan' resided.  Two men, and one female monk.   The monk that seemed the oldest, not in the way he looked, but the way he simply carried himself, introduced the other two monks by order of rank in the guild.  <br>
<br>
The red-headed female, was an officer and had been with the Zan Fi for many years.  Her name was Aaia Vellicat, her blue eyes were very friendly along with her generous smile, she bowed to the young group before her.  Bowing to the senior monk,  she sat quietly in front of the group and patiently waited for the meeting to begin.<br>
<br>
The next monk, had an extraordinary name.  Vjesczi Vrykolakas, he was the resident master of the Drunken Monkey style of fighting.  Somehow, I didn't think that style was a discipline, but rather a way of life for this monk.<br>
<br>
Next, the teacher introduced himself.  Nagasakee Waa was a powerfully built man, but with a quiet grace that reminded one of a cat stalking it's prey.  His dark hair and eyes seemed to see everything before him, and it seemed that nothing would surprise him.  Even a bard amongst the monks.<br>
<br>
All of the students sat before the monks, and Nagasakee began the meeting by telling them the story of how the Sensei Jagriel started their order.  And the divine calling that each Zan Fi strove to uphold.<br>
<br>
As I listened to Nagasakee talk, I could almost see the love and respect each of the three monks had for their Sensei.  I saw alot of the same things in Sunshu that I observed in these three.  I honestly hoped Sunshu would be able to join them.  He would be in good company.<br>
<br>
Nagasakee spoke on the few weapons that  Quellious had blessed for their use.  My attention wandering a bit, I watched the other two monks.  Vjesczi was very involved in the conversation and at times added comments about this weapon or a certain piece of armor.<br>
<br>
Aaia, like me, seemed to let her attention wander.  When our eyes met, she smiled and bowed her head to me in acknowledgement of my presence.  Even though I've never stood on formality before, it seemed only right that I returned the gesture.<br>
<br>
The door behind me creaked open, and I sensed someone standing behind me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I'm late.  Do you mind if I sit here with you and listen?  I don't wish to interrupt the meeting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning my head, I saw a tall man, dressed in the softest looking red robe I had ever seen.  Behind him floated an air elemental, and I knew he was a mage.  I smiled and whispered that I would be happy to share the spot.<br>
<br>
As he sat he muttered something about Aaia killing him.  I guess he must have seen my confused look, because he then explained that Aaia had sent him on an errand, and he had gotten side tracked at the Herb Jar.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah well, I guess it doesn't matter.  I've been to these meetings dozens of times.  I'm only really here to run errands during the meetings.  Who would have thought a mage of the 40th level would become an errand boy?&quot;  He said with a grin.<br>
<br>
I couldn't help but smile back, this Magician was unlike the other casters I had met.  Instead of acting so serious all the time, he cracked jokes and chatted away about the three members of the Zan Fi.  Over the next hour, I learned that he and Aaia were...as he put it, an 'item', that Vj, as he called him, was a master brewer, and that Nagasakee was responsible for overseeing not only the training meetings, but also the mentoring of <br>
new members.<br>
<br>
At one point, he quieted, saying that the next part of Nagasakee's lesson was one of his favorites.<br>
<br>
We both quieted and listened as Nagasakee and the Zan Fi members stood before the class.  &quot;My friends, look at the equipment that I and my brother and sister have.  Tell us, if you can, what is our most prized possession?  I'll give you one clue, it is something that all of us have.  Feel free to stand and inspect us closer.&quot;<br>
<br>
There were guesses of the Flowing Black Silk Sash they all wore.  Someone said the Cloaks of Polar Bear fur.  All guesses were met with a smile and a negative answer.<br>
<br>
Sunshu and another monk, I believe his name had been said to be Belyle, had not stood to inspect the three monks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I imagine those are the two that Seta had talked about.&quot;  The magician muttered.  I was tempted to ask him what he meant, but I wasn't completely sure he realized he was talking out loud.<br>
<br>
Aaia turned to Sunshu and Belyle, smiled and bowed.  &quot;Brothers, would you care to make a guess?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sunshu and Belyle looked at each other.  Belyle smiled a mischievous grin and looked at Aaia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, it's something you all have.  And something you all treasure.  I'm assuming you all take pride in the fact that you have it, and that you earned it, right?&quot;  He asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right.&quot;  Aaia answered.  Her smile widening.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's simple.  It's your guild tag.  The one thing that proclaims to Norrath that you are a Zan Fi Monk.&quot;  Sunshu said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good!&quot;  Nagasakee said and Vjeszci handed them both a brown bottle, winked and said it was for later.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Do you understand why our badge is our most prized possession?&quot;  Aaia asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's because your weapons and armor changes.  However, as long as you hold with the teachings of the Zan Fi, and Quellious, you will carry that badge.&quot;  answered Belyle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, good!  Anything else?&quot;  Nagasakee asked.<br>
<br>
Now the other monks were chiming in with their thoughts on why the Zan Fi considered the badge their most prized possession.  Aaia and Vjeszci had their heads together, smiling and nodding.<br>
<br>
As the meeting began to come to an end, the magician excused himself and joined the Zan Fi Monks.<br>
<br>
I sat watching Sunshu around these other monks.  The boy I knew was gone, I suddenly realized.  We had both grown up.<br>
<br>
I missed the ending of the meeting, but suddenly Sunshu was standing on the ground below the small rise I was sitting on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shosh, come down.  I want to introduce you.&quot;  he said, smiling up at me.<br>
<br>
I looked over and the only people that had remained behind were the 3 Zan Fi, the magician, and Belyle.  Hopping down onto the training grasses, Sunshu took my hand and gave it an excited squeeze.  I was happy for him, because it seemed he was going to be able to take his first steps towards becoming a Zan Fi.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you're scared and worried, but somehow I think they will help us.  I think we can trust them.  But first, let's make friends, because I think we'll need all the friends we can get.&quot;  He whispered to me.<br>
<br>
As we approached the group the three Zan Fi Monks turned and bowed to me.  The formality of the meeting was a little intimidating.  Bowing in return, Sunshu and I joined the group.<br>
<br>
&quot;Teacher, brothers, sister, may I present my friend and companion, Shoshannah.  She is studying to be a bard at the 'Wind Spirit Song'.  Shoshannah, this is the Teacher Nagasakee Waa.&quot;  Sunshu gestured to the dark haired, dark eyed monk that had lead the meeting.<br>
<br>
Nagasakee smiled and told me that he was truly pleased to meet me.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is Aaia Vellicat,&quot;  he introduced the woman.  She had a very friendly face, her bright red hair shone in the light of the lanterns close by.  &quot;This is Infynite, Aaia's companion.&quot;  The mage stepped forward, took my hand that Sunshu had held, bowed and kissed it.<br>
<br>
Aaia snorted and said,&quot; Don't expect that again.  He's just showing off.&quot;  She grinned.<br>
<br>
Vjesczi laughed and stepped forward.  His dark looks were a bit foreboding, but the sparkle in his eyes gave an indication of his true nature.  &quot;I'm Vjesczi, but don't try and say it.  It took me 10 years, and I'm not sure I even say it right.  Call me Vj.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And this is Belyle, he will also be undergoing the Novice Quest.&quot;  Nagasakee gestured to the other monk that stayed after class.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi.&quot;  Belyle smiled at me.  &quot;Sunshu is a lucky guy, I hope we'll all become good friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted Shoshannah to join us, from what Sunshu has told me, she will be travelling with him as he completes the quest.&quot;  Nagasakee explained.<br>
<br>
He then proceeded to tell us that we needed to get both the Orange Sash and Orange Headband from both monk guild halls.  And to collect a certain number of silk swatches, pearls, and heady kiolas.  All of which were to be used in making armor for the Novices or younger monks that came to the meetings.<br>
<br>
By the sound of their words, Sunshu had a very good chance of becoming a member.  I knew this was something he had been looking forward to for some time.  Ever since he had first heard to the Zan Fi.<br>

You ARE the first contact.  So therefore, you needed to be first here also.  Plus, well...you are too intertwined with myself and Sunshu.  Since this is our story, all of our friends will appear....perhaps even some that aren't so friendly.<br>
<br>
I am currently working on the third part of my story, RL has kept me from posting in the evening, but hopefully this weekend I will have the 3rd and 4th parts ready.<br>

Stay safe my friend.<br>
