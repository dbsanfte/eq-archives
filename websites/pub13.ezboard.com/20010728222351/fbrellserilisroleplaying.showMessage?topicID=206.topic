--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a story meant to be in the Gothic style. I enjoy gothic books and when I played P&amp;P RPG Ravenloft was by far my favorite. It is a bit graphic in parts but I hope you enjoy it.<br>
<br>
Kenshu stopped and listened to the sounds of the forest. He was accutely awair of his surroundings but something in the forest was not as it was supposed to be. Night was approaching and though that meant that humans must camp or risk losing the path Kenshu was not prone to this problem. His fathers elven blood had given him the benefit of great night vision. <br>
Stooping to examine the ground for sign of the bandit trail he picked up a pinch of earth and sniffed it the poignant stench of halfling feet permeated the sample. He had been tracking this particular group of bandits for three days. He could have caught up to them at any time he chose however experience had taught him that allowing the thieves to believe they had gotten away thier crimes led them to relax and make them susceptable to a trap. <br>
Kenshu could smell the smoke from a wood fire up ahead and stealthily crept that direction. He moved through the underbrush making less noise than a field mouse until he could see the warm glow of the little fire. Springing from his crouched position he quickly scaled the nearby tree and crept out on a branch much as a cat would. He could hear the men laughing and drinking obviously secure with the thought that they had gotten away with their crime. Kenshu counted 6 men among the group but noted that another hid among the shadows apparently trying to remain obscure. Kenshu figured that he was the only one among the group that might pose a problem. Creeping back down the tree he hid himself in the forest and settled down to wait till the men had drunken themselves into a stupor. <br>
Kenshu opened his eyes and noted that the forest had gotten unaturally quiet. Night was a busy time in the forest and usually was filled with the sounds of insects and nocturnal creatures such as wolves and owls. The hair on the back of his neck stood up on end for reasons he did not fully understand and a sense of pure evil was in the air. Gathering his swords he crept to his feet when an unearthly wail pierced him to the soul. A feeling of panic crept in his throat like bile and he peered into the darkness of the night. It was unaturally dark and even his elven night vision did little to show him what could possibly be out there. <br>
A scream filled terror filled the night air as the sound of shouting and fighting filled the forest. Kenshu realised that whatever had filled him such fear had found the boandits camp. Abandoning all caution he ran towards it certain that it would take every bit of effort to turn back the evil. As he entered the ring of light cast by the campfire he noted that the sounds of battle had stopped however the awful screaming of a man obviously filled with terror careemed of the surrounding hills. He looked around him at the carnage that was once the camp. The remains of a man, his throat ripped out by a terrible force, lay pron upon the ground. A halfling head was lying near the fire his evicerated body strewn across an area the size of a small room. Blood covered the ground and sizzled as it flowed along the ground towards the fire. <br>
Hearing movment near the remnants of a tent he drew his swords and carefully moved the canvas aside. What he saw nearly made him gag the smell of burnt flesh permeating the air. He noted that another of the bandits was still smoking, the upper portion of his body apparently blown off by the force of a great blast the lower half still whole except near the waist where it still smoldered the spine and a few of the ribs showing through the charred and seared cavity. Hearing the movement again he thrust aside the rest of the canvas to find the last bandit eviscerated his liver and intestinces stung along the ground. The bandit had apparently tried to crawl away as the intestines were sturn behind the man his hands and knees smashing it as he crawled. This man was still alive Kenshu stooped to ask the man what had happened here but the terror in his eyes alerted Kenshu that he would not be able to communicate. Feeling pity on the man Kenshu brought his sword down quickly severing the dead from the neck cleanly. <br>
Screams from an obviously terrified or pain racked man still bounced off the hills but he could not tell where they came from. Unsure what could have been so evil as to do this Kenshu felt that the best course of action was to search the corpses for the artifact they had stolen then with all haste get as far away from this place as he could. He searched among the remains of the tents and packs yet he could not find what he sought. Making haste he gathered his swords and bow and made his way towards the pass the led out of the valley. The screams of the man still tortured him however he knew that whatever had caused this carnage was way beyond his skill to handle. He crept through the forest staying off the path in hopes that whatever he feared would be staying on it.<br>
The screams had died out after just a few minutes of travelling and Kenshu knew that the man must either be dead or uconscious. A scream pierced the night air and again the hair on the back of his neck stood on end. Hurrying to make as much distance between him and the carnage he had seen he knew that he was no longer the hunter but the hunted.<br>
He didn't know how but he knew that whatever had killed those bandits now hunted him. He didn't know how or whay but every fiber of his being screamed to run. However his years of tracking bandits and thieves had taught him that running only alerted his followers to his location. Looking at the forest around him he quickly deducted that his best way to alude his follower was to take to the trees. Springing to the lower branches of a tree he crept out and sprang to the next tree making no more noise than a squirrel. He went from from tree to tree when an unearthly howl split the night air not far from his location. Hoping that his hunter had lost the trail he stopped and held his breath to better hear the night. Not hearing anything hing sprang to the next tree then stopped as he heard a rustle below him. Kenshu knew that whatever it was had found him. Hoping that the creature would think that it had lost the track he held absolutely still. He could hear the thing breathing and scratching at the ground. <br>
The tree he was in began to vibrate and he knew that he had been found. The tree then began to shake violently as whatever it was attempted to climb after him. It made no noise as it attempted to scramble up the tree however he could hear the bark breaking off as the apparent weight of the creature ripped it from the tree. Then the tree shook as it took out its frustration or tried to shake him from the tree kenshu was unsure as to which. A shrill screech filled the air as it voiced its frustration. Then all got silent the very air seemed to stand still as the tension filled the night air. An explosion seemed to rock the tree and he realised that rather than climb the tree the thing had merely lept to the very branch Kenshu now crouched on. He could feelt he things breath but was still unable to see what it was though he could sense that it was but a few feet away. Springing into motion he leapt from branch to branch finally stopping in the bows of an old and dying pine tree. He could hear the creature following and as it landed on the branch next to him a great crack was heard as the combined weight was too much for the dried wood. Thinking quicky he drew his short sword and thrust it into the soft wood. The tree let forth another great crack and the brach broke away falling with the creature to the ground. Kenshu listened for a period of time trying to hear what the creature would do next but there was no sound from the ground below. Stopping for a few minutes to catch his breath he then noticed the smell of water and the roar of a distant river. Still he could not hear anything from the ground below. Kenshu looked towards the horizon and noticed that dawn was approaching. Knowing that his chances were slim the approaching light gave him hope. He looked towards the ground again and was satisfied that his normally acute night vision was returning. He then noticed that he had lept onto a tree that was on the edge of a cliff. The river he heard was thousands of feet below the him the branch that had broken off was over the cliff. Kenshu breathed a sigh of relief as he realised that the branch with the creature had pllummeted into the raging river below and over the waterfall in the ditance. <br>
Climbing from the tree he took off on a dead run straight for the nearest outpost to report what he found. Certain that he had miraculously escaped death he prayed to the gods and thanked them for yet another day. <br>
