<br>
1 -- Venril shouldn't be reserved.  If he is, you should be obligated to provide at least 50% of the raid crew in advance, members of which do NOT comprise any other raid crew.  (IE: The Adun plan)<br>
<br>
2 -- Vox/Nag should be reserved in spite of the long lists.  Its the only mildly &quot;epic&quot; encounter players between 46th and 50th can actually lead.<br>
<br>
3-- Trakanon's list is okay the way it is.....should indy's be on it?  Personally, I don't believe so because the only way to kill trakanon is to effectively hire out from the guilds on the server, but I'm indifferent to the whole thing really because he's a rapid spawn compared to a mob like Venril. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usyrillian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syrillian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/13/01 7:36:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DISCUSSION - Our Reservation system</span><hr size=1> VS -  shouldn't be reserved<br>

Vox Naggy- shouldn't be reserved (but is not as big an issue, verant capping the level that can go in on these means they aren't higher level targets)<br>

Trakanon-  shouldn't be reserved<br>

<br>
Trakanon : no need to change anything really...<br>
<br>
VS : The list is long, but making him FFA would give only a very few guilds an adventage and would make it impossible for other guilds to get him, because they can kill him but not as fast as Uberguild_00<br>
<br>
<br>
Comments that could apply to the 3 of them and to other spots..<br>
<br>
Indies : being in a guild should only be a personal choice and should not give you any special rights. Someone who hasnt found a guild he likes enough to join it shouldnt have to kiss other guilds' asses to get on raids for a certain mob<br>
being an indy doesnt mean you cant get the forces to raid anything anytime as well, just recently the first time wuoshi fell on brell, the raid was led by an indy (danni)<br>
<br>
providing 50% of the raid : totally impossible to apply<br>
I've seen VS killed with 4 groups and with 9 (god that was laggy as hell), who is going to decide what are the 50% ? one of those raids doesnt even weights 50% of the other<br>
Another point is that if you put a rule like this in the reservation system, there is then no reason to stop an indy from reserving a mob, as they can also get the 50% to sign up<br>
<br>
Level restriction : nag/vox have been killed with a leader over 53...<br>
I would only allow people in the correct level range to lead a raid on a specific target<br>
This would mean 8 levels below the toughest mob (so 47 for nag and 57 for trak...) and no higher than 52 for nag/vox<br>
it would cut off some people reserving something and planning on other people to kill it for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usadara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boo!!!</span><br>  Posts: 653<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/14/01 1:07:03 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DISCUSSION - Our Reservation system</span><hr size=1> Venril - Yes, Venril should be reservable.  Yes, take Indy's off the list (right off the top that will shave 7 weeks off the list).  Yes, the raid crew should be able to provide 50% of a 5 group raid with memebers of their own guild that are level 50 or higher.  <br>
<br>
*note*  The one thing I have yet to understand is how exactly this Essense of Venril works.  Is he up when Venril isn't or is he only triggered when the real Venril dies?<br>
<br>
In my opinion, for Venril to not be reservable will only cause a select few guilds to dominate that spawn.  There by, making it unfair to others on the server, which is the reason for the rotations lists in the first place.  There are a number of people that are in higher end guilds on the server that could stand to benefit by having the greaves that drop off him or items for their epics.  Many of the wizi's in these same guilds still need that ultra rare staff off him.  Changing Venril to an unreservable spawn will not solve the problem, but will only change the kind of problems we have with this spawn.  We'll hear rants in the rants section of Uberguild_00 always killing Venril and no one else getting the chance.<br>
<br>
The problem is with the list being so darn long.  The question we should be asking is what can we do to reduce the length of the list?  Doing the 50% rule should help to encourage guilds to join together for this raid.  Hopefully, this would help reduce the length of the list.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I think this needs a tad more discussion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Vox/Nag - Should remain reservable.  Indy's should be removed from the rotation.  I don't think any other changes will benefit these lists, I could be wrong though.<br>
<br>
Trakanon - I don't see any need for change.  It's actually the smoothest list of all the rotations we have.<br>
<br>

I believe that we wouldn't have this gridlock in one area, and a near complete lack of attention in an other area if we weren't reserving key mobs like VS.  Meaning that, while there are dozens of guilds on the VS rotation, how many people do you see lining up to kill the Vindicator?  Or to ravage the temple of Veeshan, etc...the reason for this is that since the amount of VS/Trak killings has been so spread out amongst guilds, guilds have to wait a longer amount of time to get the gear they need to move on to higher end areas.(be it epic quests pieces, or the necessary armor that tanks need to keep up with high end Velious mobs)  While they are waiting, more and more guilds are coming to power and joining the waiting list, making the wait that much longer.  If we just canned reservation on VS/Trakanon, then yes, lower level guilds would not have a  chance at him- but only for a little while.  Realistically, one of the current &quot;lower level&quot; guilds would probably miss no more than one shot on their rotation.  The waiting list is like what?  8 months or something.  It would NOT take all of the &quot;Uber&quot; guilds on the server 8 months to get the gear they need and move on from mobs like VS and Trakanon. (One big factor is that Uber guilds tend not to fail that often killing these mobs) This would in turn mean that there are less guilds wanting to kill these mobs, and thus freeing up some of the gridlock.    <br>
<br>
Vox/Nag- Remove indies, but allow guilds to reserve them, in order to give that guild the experience and gear they need to move on to higher end raids in the future.  There's nothing that says a current &quot;non-uber&quot; guild can't become uber in the future. =D<br>

Other than VI needing to do something about him IMO.. <br>
This might be a really dumb idea, but what about setting up a list, but it only has 2 guilds on it.  All guilds wanting to be in the random sign up here.  Then someone in game (elected, random, i dont care) does an 'official' roll.  If 20 guilds sign up, then /rand 0 20.  You now have 2 weeks before he's up to assemble.<br>
<br>
If your guild wins the roll, your out of rolls for say 7 weeks? (arbitrary number obviously).<br>
EDIT - <br>
Having to wait 7 months before your guild is up, is utterly ridiculous and retarded.  <br>
<br>
If not, then i think he should be FCFS.<br>

Between LoH, SR, Enshadowed, Watchers, and maybe some other guilds, Trakanon/VS could be dead within only a few hours of him spawning.<br>
<br>
There are some people that have not been guild affiliated that could gather the required people for a raid somewhat &quot;easily&quot;.  Grrumble and Danni are people that stick out in my mind, and now Adune.  I think that everyone has just as much right to lead a raid as anyone else, regardless of guild tag.<br>
<br>
I think that Adun's idea he presented a while ago is good.  I'm not sure if this is exactly it, but this is what I think should be done:<br>
<br>
I propose that instead of a single person doing a reservation of an uber mob, you have 15 people doing the reservation, all under one raid leader.  If you are supporting the reservation of one epic mob, you can't be assisting in the reservation of another epic mob.  So, for example, if Kruunch (Just picked his name at random) wants to lead a VS raid, he and the 14 others that are supporting him are all acting as one person to reserve VS.  None of those 15 people may use their names to help reserve VS for another date until their raid is completed.  None of those 15 people may use their names to reserve other epic mobs until their raid is completed.  Perhaps having your name on 2 reservations is ok.  Dunno.<br>
<br>
This would allow anyone with enough preestablished support to reserve something, but you won't have the same group of people reserving epic mobs just under a different name.  You won't have the same 15 wizards all leading a VS raid as an independant all inviting each other.<br>
<br>
The result of this would be that SR could have about 2-3 reservations due to their population being about 40 people?, while a smaller guild of only about 20 people could only reserve 1 mob, and an independant can still run a raid, as long as they know enough people that have not yet committed to any raids yet.<br>

<br>
I used to agree with you. The problem is, you can't please everyone. It's just not feesible. No one is saying that Indies can't go on other people's raids. If they are the kinds of indies who can gather support for a raid, than they are also the type of indies that guilds WANT on their raids!<br>
<br>
Right now, our VS list is at critical mass. SOMETHING has to give. As it stands, indies aren't even coming here to argue for themselves! It's only people like you and I who wanted to do what was fair across the board who even argued for Indies in the first place.<br>
<br>
Finally, the server is a LOT different than it used to be. More and more people are joining guilds for the express purpose of raiding. There really are very, very few indies at the highest level of the game, and those that are can certainly hop on other people's raids.<br>
<br>
Finally, to quote Dr. Spock and Captain Kirk -<br>
 <br>
&quot;The needs of the many outwiegh the needs of the few.&quot;<br>
&quot;Or the one.&quot;<br>
<br>
VS - remove indies. Require 50% of the raid to consist of the Guild who signs up. Have them at LEAST provide 15 ppl from their guild who will/can contribute to reserve the spot. <br>
<br>
<br>
Vox/Naggy - remove indies.<br>
<br>
Trak - He ain't broke, don't fix it. However, I wouldn't be opposed, for consistency's sake, if we removed indies.<br>
<br>
Finally, I would hope that we put EACH vote on a separate vote thread. &quot;Do we change Vox/Naggy?&quot; (own thread) &quot;Do we change Trak?&quot; (own thread) I would hate to see ALL changes get nixed b/c we insist on changing them all in the same vote thread. May take a little longer, but the end result will be more consistent with what more people want done.)<br>

<br>
I disagree with VS.  Do I want to wait 7 month for a shot at my epic, hell no.  But, if this happens, I will probably never get a shot at it.<br>
<br>
What's happening on the servers that don't have a reservation system?  From what I can see, basically 2 or 3 guilds have control over VS and they decide who is worthy or not of wielding an epic, of course that worthyness comes at a 20k price tag... screw that.<br>
<br>
Could the UNB provide 50% of the raid necessary for VS?  Probably not today, it would be closer to 30%.  We do have 15 or so members over 53 today, but not the right mix.  Seven months from now, if the guild is around and doesn't much change, we would probably be able to provide near 70%.<br>
<br>
Verant really needs to look at the bottle neck created by having two classes needing the same thing off a mob that only spawns once a week.<br>
<br>
My thoughts anyway,<br>

<br>
First, your point saying that indies are not coming her to defend their point is, sorry to be rough, pure bullshit!<br>
What do you think i am ? DING! An indy !<br>
number of indies who posted here : 2<br>
number of peeps in uberguilds (blah blah not uber..) : 7<br>
number of peeps in guilds not able to fill 50% of a VS raid : 3<br>
<br>
<br>
Then, your way to present the debate using the star trek quote is extremely biased.<br>
Take juujuu/adune's idea, it would make no difference for big guilds, but would be a real pain for indies... yes it's acceptable, because everyone would make a sacrifice for the good of the community.<br>
Even if it's not what i would like to see done, i dont find it outrageous, because everyone would have the same rights (even the version allowing a guild to sign up several times if they can provide 50% of each with different members would still be acceptable)<br>
<br>
However removing indies from the rotation is completely different. you are forcing a part of the comunity to make a HUGE sacrifice, and for what ? for guilds to get VS/trak more often ? it's a really nice deal for you, you're asking other people to make a sacrifice so your life can be better.<br>
<br>
Dont you have the impression you're losing contact with the reality here ? This is a game, everyone has to make efforts to live with others, that's normal. Uberguilds, indies, small guilds... they have to follow the same rules.<br>
On FFA servers, same thing, uberguilds get all the spawns because they are more organized, but if indies were more organized, they'd have the spawn then.<br>
<br>
Here you are just saying that no matter what you're capable of, an indy will not have the same rights as a player in a guild...<br>
This is not the comunity making efforts so everyone can enjoy the game more, this is a part of the comunity sacrificing another so they can have more fun.<br>
<br>
Not changing anything would be my favorite option.<br>
Using Juujuu's stuff would be next.<br>
In the worst case, make them FFA.<br>
but dont, DONT EVER, make different rules for each kind of player!<br>
<br>
I honestly find it insulting that you dont consider me or any other indy worth the same as you.<br>
You dont allow a car to go 20 mph faster than another because it's more stable than the other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubalara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/14/01 11:26:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DISCUSSION - Our Reservation system</span><hr size=1> VS : needs to be changed i dont want to see any one lose out , but to be honest other than epic itmes i dont see any real need for the larger guilds to farm him . We just want our epics and to be able to move on . The legs are nice but at this point we can do better quicker in SOV . I dont think he should be reserved being an epic mob . <br>
<br>
Trak : list can remain the same i see no reason to chage it at this point . Although SOV qeust BPs are rare they are better than traks .<br>

Vox and nag : long list but should remain the same <br>

<br>
I take the opposite view (of course).  I consider an indy making a reservation EXTREMELY selfish. Currently, our system says &quot;Your raid, your rules.&quot; That means, ANY Indy can go and make a reservation - AND claim any piece they want. THAT is selfish. Not to mention, with the current rules in place, VS is a huge bone of contention. For those people who want FCFS they point to VS more than anything as a reason our system is so &quot;stupid&quot; or whatever.<br>
<br>
You're also missing a huge point, and one I made in my last post. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What exactly is keeping an Indy from going on a guild's raid?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Btw, I only became guilded again about two weeks ago. Before then I was independent for over four months, and I said the SAME things. <br>
<br>
The needs of the server have changed. Back when we needed Indy raids, it was because there were so few guilds back then who could field their own raids. Now we have TONS of guilds who can and any available Indies can hop on one of those guilds' raids to get their items. <br>
<br>
However, if we moved to the system that Adune suggested, I could live with that. Under the assumption of course, that we limit where a person could place his/her name in filling out one of the twenty people on a given roster.<br>
 <br>
Ultimately, that is the fairest method of serving all the potential people who could even use those spawns. The tough thing is explaining that point, and proving it to enough people. I happen to think that the simpler the rule, the easier it passes.<br>

<br>
I think INDYS should be removed from all lists. althoguh this may sound hypocritical of me since i was a big advocate for INDYs even though ive always been in a guild myself, I now feel the server dynamics have changed enough that INDY raids cant be justified on the current reservaion syste.<br>
By dynamics I mean number of players, level of player, RL age of the server, and number of guilds. If you want to do dragons i think you should be able to put forth the effort to either establish your own guild, or find one that you can agree with.<br>
<br>
I just wonder how things would change with no resevation system at all. what with lists that range from 2 weeks of professional board camping, to months on a list, how can it get any worse?<br>
