<br>
My guild is about 33 members.  15 of which are over 50th level, and are commonly on most weekly raids/hunts.<br>
<br>
We have a few epic weapons.. One Cleric Epic, Two shaman Epics, one Druid epic.<br>
<br>
Overall the guild is able to do most camps, and has good relations with other strong guild to do major hunts on rare occasions (Just did HoT with a buddy guild).<br>
<br>
The guild's focus is friendship.  We do not have any members that would be considered power levelers, and only one level 60 (next closest to that is a 57 shaman).<br>
<br>
Mostly we want a system for loot that is non-biased and will not get in the way of our friendships.<br>
<br>
Random is mostly what we use now, but it is getting more difficult to put things to a dice roll.<br>
<br>
(i.e. we got a 13/28 dagger during caller quest in FG.  We initially said "Could use classes random", but then we realized that this is a very good rogue item for BS damage, and not as good for other classes...)<br>
<br>
The guild has a long history of generosity, and selfless giving to other members, and we don't want a new 'loot' system to corrupt that.<br>
<br>
Mostly we just want a way to handle loot without destroying the friendships. <p><table width="85%" border="0">

<br>
But when the only leather BP we've seen was won in a lotto by an unguilded monk guest, and other drops similar to that going to non-members or members on trial, we've had to re-evaluate our system. So we're still lotto-based but we're considering the following distribution:<br>
<br>
&quot;Loot priority is best summarized as follows:<br>
1. Primaries and Guests Necessary for the Raid<br>
2. Tagged Initiates<br>
3. Guests / Played Secondaries<br>
<br>
This means that an item will first be lotto’ed among full members and invited guests vital to the success of the raid; if no full members or necessary guests are in need, then the lotto is opened to initiates who are completing the month trial. The lotto is then opened to all guests and secondaries.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's a hot topic in my guild, but we're not a raid guild and absolutely don't want to do points.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps a little... I don't even know if our members will approve that system, but it's an idea. :) <p><center><a href="http://madoka.home.texas.net/custom.htm"><img border=0 src="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/profile/mist_sig.jpg"></a><br>

<br>
#2 - Stick with your plan once you implement it.  If you start out one way, but make exceptions here and there, it'll do nothing but make trouble for you.<br>
<br>
My own personal favorite system is a weighted lotto, but it's a pain to keep records on.  Each time someone participates in a raid, or in a uber/epic mob kill, they are awarded so many points (tougher mobs could have more points, etc.)<br>
<br>
When a piece of loot drops that more than one person wants, then their total points are added up and a /random is done.<br>
<br>
Here's an example.  guildie_001 has 100 raid points. guildie_002 has 250 raid points.  Total is 350.  Now, an item drops that they both can and will use.  A /random 0 350 is done.  If it falls in the first 100, guildie_001 gets it, otherwise it goes to guildie_002.<br>
<br>
Another variation to this is to assign points to each piece of loot and whenever someone gets awarded something, they get those points deducted from their raid point total, meaning it's less likely they will win the next random.<br>
<br>
So, if a CoF dropped in the above example, and guildie_002 won, he would have 200 points removed from his total (for example).<br>
<br>
Like I said, it's a complicated thing to track recordkeeping wise, but it's about the most fair system you can have.  Everyone has a shot at winning something, yet people with more time put into guild raids gets a better shot, plus people who already have won things may not win everything.<br>
<br>
There are a few big guilds that use variations of this system, so you can probably look around and find a set of points already set up for most mobs/raids if you wanted a quicker start.<br>

Ours is called ELP, I guess for Earned Loot Points :)<br>
<br>
We use a simple system based exclusively on raid attendance+kill points. Mobs are assigned a certain number of points and players accumulate their points to use in auctions. Only the &quot;main&quot; characters are allowed to bid. (No twink can lotto against a main). <br>
<br>
Also, the loot of mobs that do NOT yield points is not subject to auction but is then lottoed.   <br>
<br>
The system has worked very well but requires the guildleaders to use logs to count all the players in attendance.  However, a simple programn was written and the database is updated the day after the raids.<br>
<br>
You can check several guilds who are posting their points online. Some systems use different criterias. Check Afterlife guild website for an example of a slightly more complicated system.  I hope Sobe does not mind this bit of publicity. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udariannedawnfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darianne Dawnfyre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 12:31:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26482.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot System.</span><hr size=1> <br>
Point systems are nice, but don't lend themself to &quot;Need before Greed&quot;.   Someone with the most points can get something, rather than a person who could &quot;use it most&quot;.   And if you put restrictions on the point system like &quot;You can roll/bid on things you want with points... but not if someone else needs it more&quot; then you truly don't have a points system... because guarenteed, &quot;Bob&quot; will have tons of points, and something he really wants will drop, and then if he's told &quot;Jane can use it better, you can't roll (or even shouldn't roll)&quot; ... one of Bobs easy responses is &quot;I've earned all these points, I have a right to use them&quot;.  <br>

<br>
We roll on normal armor items not BP or Leg items, and other decent loot... anything that is a BP, Legs, or considered "Uber" (we usually consider uber something that we can not necisarily go back and get all the time, maybe not everyone considers it uber, but pretty much everything off of rare mobs such as velks, dragons, ssra temple bosses, etc. is awarded...)<br>
<br>
The way we award things?  honestly I can't say caus I am not an officer, but it seems like they go by the following categories<br>
<br>
Participation<br>
Overall Time Spent Raiding<br>
If they help others no matter what<br>
If they sit in seb while we are raiding<br>
Main/Alt<br>
Etc.<br>
<br>
-Participation is one of the largest factors, we generally consider someone that spends every moment they play EQ raiding or with the guild much more valuable then someone who spends a LOT more time on EQ buut only spends maybe 1/2 of it with the guild at hunts, and misses some (even if they hunts they are on outnumber the amount of time the other person has spent)<br>
-Also it is frowned upon if it seems you are going to raids that benefit yourself, IE Velks raid comes up, every caster in the guild runs to velks to get their special item, but then we decide to do vindi, and many of the same people refuse to come, either they just say they are in a group and can't leave, or they don't log on all together and make up some stupid excuse all the time... If the caster always shows up to fear, but never hate (if they get their items from fear, and vice versa)<br>
-One of the worst things I consider is when a member sits in seb, or wherever else getting EXP while we are raiding... I don't know if this is as much of an issue to the loot distrubuters as myself, but I can't stand it.  If I was doing loot, and I assume they do it the same way, they will generally type name filters while we are at raids, and if they see the same name exping while we are raiding over and over, they, hopefully, put them further down the list of people for loot<br>
-Last thing is obviously a main/alt... rarely do we give uber items to an alt over a main... but it has happened before... these situations come up when the alt, is really played as much as the main, and say a 55 cleric, and they chose to play them to help the guild, rather then play their 60 necro, or something... or play both... anyways, these people will get preference over people that never show up, or appear to be a flight risk (leaving the guild soon), or sit in seb exping.  <br>
<br>
Generally Moonhawk, our guildleader, will ask over GC who wants the item, then set those things up against each other, and we all trust that he will make a good decision on who gets it.  If he is not at the hunt generally 2-3 officers that are at the hunt decide...<br>
<br>
Hope that Helped<br>

From I read your guild was like mine in the beginning. We were small, close knit, but couldn't do much more than the planes (lvl avg was around 50). Random worked fine. When we all started getting serious about lvling up and tackling bigger things, we moved to a half random half award system. Basically, the rare items (bp's and epic parts for example) were awarded, everything else was randomed. This took a lot of adjustment for most people and at the same time we became allied with 2 other guilds which made it all the more complicated. Some people thought everything should be randomed but most thought everything should be awarded. It worked out ok, since we were still growing, gaining lvl's and strength.  But, after a while, loot issues started getting in the way of our alliance so the guild leaders sat down, discussed it and decided that from then on everything would be awarded by whoever was leading the raid at the time. This, ultimatly caused the biggest problem. Since we were dealing with 3 guilds, it was hard for one person to make a fair judgement. Afterall, how do they know what someone might deserve if they only see them once in a while rather than seeing you own guild mates on a constant basis (if that makes sense). Finally, we turned to a loot council. One person from each guild (we now have 4 in the alliance) is on the loot council with the raid leader breaking any ties. LC changes from raid to raid sometimes just to make sure we stay unbiased. However, only those that come to almost every raid and have shown themselves to have good judgement are picked to be on LC. My guild is in charge of keeping the loot list for each month and posts it up for everyone to see. This helps people make fair decisions. It's not perfect, but it works for us and it's relatively low maintenance. <br>
<br>
The whole thing may sound corny, but just wanted to give you some insight on how things might go for you when you start to change loot policies. Like I said, it all depends on what your guild has coming in loot wise, how many people are involved and what you are able to accomplish. Best of luck to you, this topic is *always* a hard one. And if you are going to be the one deciding on loot all the time be prepared to be scrutinzed at every turn. You can never make everyone happy and some people will always disagree with your decisions, but things always tend to wash out in the end.
