class=title>   Ashes to Ashes   (RP)</span><hr size=1> General Zirrix stood in the War Room of the Indigo Brotherhood’s headquarters and examined the map. It had been another long strategy session with the other Generals of the Empire. There had also been a representative of their Imperial Majesties as well in attendance. What he had planed, and what was about to happen, had not before, not ever in the history of Norrath, been conducted. Zirrix was going to make both dreams and nightmares come true at the same time. He would give solid form to the shadowy demons of children’s terror tales. He would show his people, yet again, their true place in the world and the power of the Teir’dal. Many still told stories of the attack upon Kelethin, about the death and destruction that reigned supreme that glorious day. But, once again, the enemies of the Empire had grown secure and relaxed. The sorrow and doom of Kelethin had begun to fade in their memories. Zirrix, with the his guild the Violent Harvest leading that charge, shall refresh their memories in a most hateful and terrible way. He had personally, through fey and powerful magics, scouted out the object of his wrath many times. He knew their strengths, their weakness, their hopes and their fears. He supposed he should make some rousing speeches, ignite the people into a frenzy against their ancient and eternal foe. But such was not his nature. He would proceed more cunningly, steadily and with dreadful resolve. How many times had those very enemies attacked the Nektulos Forest and killed his faithful and skilled troops. How often had they dared even assault the very gates of Neriak itself. He knew their plans, to keep the Respected Race off balance, to drain away their resources and resolve. To conspire and commit acts of treachery which would play one Great House off against another. For too long such tactics had been fruitful, for too long had the poison and trickery done their foul work.<br>
<br>
Now they would pay, they would all pay, in pain, blood and death. Zirrix checked the supply manifests, troop concentrations and dispositions once more. The Arcanists had their assignments and targets, and the Clerics knew their mission. This would be no large scale, drawn out campaign. Zirrix was no fool, even with the assistance of all the Wizards of the Tower he knew he could not keep a large force supplied and equipped in that area of Norrath for long. No, this raid would be a small yet deadly affair. The forces of the Empire would strike a blow deep into the heart of their enemy. It would be for pure destruction and vengeance, something that songs are sung for and stories are told of for generations. As his eyes glittered in hatred, alone in the War Room Zirrix thought, “Yes, you miserable bloodless freaks, it is well past time the shrieks of your abused and degraded women, and torn and dying children sounded throughout the marble walls of your city. It is time you remembered who and what you are, and more importantly why we are so very superior to you. You will be reminded why it is your destiny to eventually be exterminated to the last…by the Respected Race of the Teir’dal!”. Zirrix was not religious, but just this once he pulled from his pocket two enchanted gems. One sanctified to Rallos Zek, the other to Innoruuk. Putting both upon the large, cold, obsidian map table, he removed his sword. Brining the pommel down upon the gems again and again, he crushed them into powder. Then he mixed them together and, while saying a prayer to both Gods, sprinkled the crushed gems over the map before him. As if in answer to his supplication, the gem dust burst into black flame upon landing on the map, burning it to a cinder. The smoke from the flame forming the sigil of House T’Rhennic before evaporation into the air. Nodding in satisfaction, Zirrix grabbed a handful of the ashes and put them in a pouch under his breastplate, a charm of sorts. Then, without another word, the General left the chamber to alert the Violent Harvest and give the final orders to his forces to prepare for battle. On the table a few small fragments of the map remained. Barely readable, from the bottom corner was half a name, it read Felwi…     <br>
