As it stands right now, this looks like another half-assed attempt at caster balancing, and that doesn't help the perception people have of Verant's designers as pretty darned clueless. <br>
<br>
Did they really think that people wouldn't look at all these items across the board, and view them as a reflection of what to expect in the next batch?<br>
<br>
Brienna says &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The focus items we've seen so far are a nice start. If people would relax and give them a chance I'm sure we'll see more in a future patch.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
That's exactly what I'm talking about. If what we got in the last round is any indication of what we can expect in the next round (as has traditionally been the case when it comes to Verant implementing things over multiple patches), it's no wonder people are crying foul before waiting for the epilogue.<br>
<br>
Miss Foxfyre says &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Whatever. Don't let one issue get in the way of the larger picture.

<br>
I know you're trying to be optimistic, and maybe trying to give VI some benefit of the doubt. But admit it... you can't help but think that Verant is going to show the same lack of attention and forethought to the higher-tier items as they did with the first batch.<br>
<br>
1. For some of the existing items, it's as if someone in VI's dev department threw darts at a chart to determine which focus effect to apply to each item. <br>
2. VI tossed Risk vs. Reward out the window, by not taking into account the difficulty of personally obtaining each item; they assumed too heavily that players can all afford to &quot;buy up&quot; for items their characters are too low to obtain.<br>
3. They are not just encouraging twinking anymore, now they're requiring it for player casters to be balanced relative to their levels (I guess new players who don't have high level mains weren't considered at all).<br>
3. In the same patch, they improved caster NPCs exponentially more than they improved caster PCs.<br>
<br>
We aren't reading between the lines here. To use the book analogy -- we're simply looking at the first couple of chapters and wondering how in the world this thing got all the way to press with mistakes in punctuation, grammar, spelling....<br>

Araxx, whoever said that?  Certainly not me.  My proposal was that an item's % stay constant rather than just disappear entirely as we level.  <br>

If you somehow got the perception that % would rise with level, then I can understand your concern about farming.

If I think anything of it, it's that they are rushing way beyond their means to meet promises made by game project leaders who don't even work there anymore and couldn't give a @#%$ about EQ. Was I disappointed? Yes, but it didn't ruin my day or cause me indigestion or anything.

<br>
Verant said that the next pass  will focus more on higher level items and this first pass was mostly on lower level items.  <br>
<br>
I also am a little concerned about some of the illogical combinations offered.  But we will see.<br>
<br>
I am really hoping that some of our weaker ToV armor pieces get focus effects to help make them more interesting.  I would love to see those Tunare druids squirm if suddenly the Woven Grass Gaunts had a desireable effect and they had to think about putting those PoG gloves in the bank. /smile<br>
<br>
Still, some of the items being from NTOV, I worry a little that the next &quot;higher level&quot; phase will be about the drops that are limited to very, very few people in the game (whatever Vulak loot is still out there, Vex Thal loot, warder loot, etc).  I DO hope that there is more opportunity on some of the more mid to lower upper raid items. <br>
<br>
If not tho I will be sorely dissapointed in the executoin since as it stands they are forcing a choice between good stats and focus effects, which really does not move forward the caster power and better balance them with the tanks.<br>
<br>
And as some have noted, putting the effects on gear that normally would go to tanks simply increases competition for those drops or (more likely in many guilds) means a lot of tanks are going to get defaulted gear that has useless focus effects. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umagisarabeth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MagiSarabeth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/7/02 6:07:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27553.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why all the complaints about the new focus items?</span><hr size=1> Someone said Int casters have no need for healing gear?<br>

At least two int classes DO have healing spells (I'm not sure about enchanters) -- and situationally these items are actually good -- necros and mages.

The focus effects were stupidly or randomly assigned, and the effects themselves are dumb.<br>
<br>
One or two say well it was like that for the mage summoned focus items.  Sure.  But the mage you were with was summoning you the focus items of the right level for the spells you were using.<br>
<br>
The reason I just shake my head and laugh is because this is just so typical of the people at VI.  Oh sure, people say this is just the first round, be patient.  Well, let me ask you, why should I be patient?  They've been given the benefit of the doubt *far* too often, and responded with broken promises, lies, mistakes, and the sense that nobody over there really knows wtf is going on.<br>
<br>
I dont care if this was only round 1.  Round 1 sucked.  When is round 2 gonna happen?  Do we have any guarantee it will actually happen?  Maybe it'll happen in 4-5 months, thats how long it took them to come up with this.  Maybe it wont happen at all, like bazaar, new interface, PC caster balancing, new perma, newspapers, etc.  Oh but they fixed the blued hammer quest!  (No wait, it wasnt broken, it was merely one of those unsolved quests they couldnt figure out why nobody had completed!(*cough shakey's head cough*)) <br>
<br>
They also managed to take time away from the problems everyone is crying about (broken spawn triggers (ragefire, vulak), broken quests, stupid stupid stupid quests (ragefire), balancing some luclin encounters, PC caster balancing, non-stupid focus items, etc!) and instead brought us a &quot;fix&quot; for something nobody realized was broken.  Great, NPC casters now can kick all our butts!  Good work!  I'm not opposed to some tweaking, but this is a joke.  Sure it makes it a bit more challenging at some old easy places for my level 60 characters, but what about those who arent 60?  What about new servers like KB?  They are gonna get *smoked* by these changes.  Thanks for &quot;fixing&quot; it verant!  Please sir, can I have some more?<br>
<br>
The reason I complain about the new focus items is because they are stupid.  VI has a terrible track record of going back and fixing stupid mistakes, or even admitting there was a mistake made in the first place.  The worst part is they'll probably consider this a big part of PC caster balance (which it isnt), or given the community's general response, be shocked into inaction yet again for months and say they are working on it.<br>

Melees <b>need</b> haste to be effective, since it gives them a 100% power boost (spell plus item).  The entire game has been balanced from the very beginning with haste in mind, and higher end encounters are designed to assume that the melees all have haste.<br>
<br>
Focus items are just icing on the cake for casters, stretching some of their abilities by about 10% on average.  The appropriate analogy would be to critical hits for melees, not haste.  Plus, a mage can always summon them for casters that don't have a permanent item.  Can a mage summon a 41% haste item for a melee?<br>
<br>
<b><i>Twinking would be limited by added a character level limit to each effect.</b></i><br>
<br>
Retroactively changing many items to be level-limited is a bad idea.  How would you like to log on suddenly and find you can no longer equip some of your items because some high level player was complaining that it should have a better effect?  Remember that these items are useful for a wide variety of players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/7/02 11:29:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27553.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why all the complaints about the new focus items?</span><hr size=1> Casters are so far behind the curve, that anything, even 10%, is "needed."

I might have read your post wrong, but there have been arguments in favor of increasing an item's % effectiveness as you pass lvl 20 and 44, and removing the I, II, and III tag. Unless I've totally lost my ability to comprehend english... :P<br>
I totally agree we should not lose the effect of an item because we level, and the example of an FBSS not working after a warrior levels is very valid. Then again, just check out how farmed that item is and imagine some similar focus item...<br>
Personally I want caster balancing yesterday, and focus effects to go along with the appropriate item for the targetted class. But we also need to get better items with better focus effects, imo. Let the I tag mean 5%, II 10%, and III 15%, sure, that works fine, and it works like a normal item with 3, 5, or 10 wis on it, we'd be wanting that item as we are able to get it and level, but the wis isn't dropped once we reach lvl 44... to put an example we all have talked about. But there's something about this whole system which has me at a loss and I can't quite put my finger on. I think we're in for a surprise... And it had better be a good one. :P<br>

<br>
You only get higher percentages if you upgrade to the higher level items.  And given the amount of effort people go through to upgrade for a few points more of resistance, wis, mana, etc., I imagine that casters will similarly want to upgrade to get 5% to 20% more focus effect.<br>
<br>
If any high levels farm lower level items, it will be to sell the item to lower level players.  And that is EXACTLY the same thing that can happen under the current system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/8/02 7:18:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27553.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why all the complaints about the new focus items?</span><hr size=1> <i>the example of an FBSS not working after a warrior levels is very valid.

<br>
I am not even sure anymore that we can draw such parallels with melees. While it's true a haste item doesn't stop working as levels increase, upgrading to better haste items is a given. How many melees do you know are still using an FBSS? Because there are upgrades, no melee wants "old crap." Doesn't the existence of a higher focus on an item fit into this whole upgrade treadmill? :D<br>
<br>
Second, we do have existing items with permeffects. Perhaps there are not enough of these items overall. That's why focus items made sense, especially for the low-mid levels who won't/don't get FT items.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>we'd be wanting that item as we are able to get it and level, but the wis isn't dropped once we reach lvl 44...</i><br>
<br>
Casters have always had to choose between situational gear. In fact, before the rampant abundance of wisdom items, you used to have to sacrifice day-to-day gear for resist gear, and your wisdom would take a toll and could drop by as many as 20 points. I know that I used to don 180 wisdom with resist gear on. Those just entering the "raid machine" and buying resist gear may still have to sacrifice wisdom or mana or both to make up for resists. <br>

<br>
Sure we can draw the parallel.  And the existence of higher focus items is a given, since there are already high focus items in the game.  We just don't have enough of them.  But in the interim, doesn't it make sense that a level II spell haste item (like the NoS) should work equally well whether I am casting a level 44-60 spell as one below 44?<br>
<br>
Otherwise, your argument about how melee players upgrade haste is exactly my argument.  No caster is going to want "old crap" with level I or II effects if there are upgrades to level III with better stats available.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Second, we do have existing items with permeffects. Perhaps there are not enough of these items overall. That's why focus items made sense, especially for the low-mid levels who won't/don't get FT items.</b><br>
<br>
I daresay a lot of high levels won't get more than a few FT items, if any.  Sure, items with permeffects make a lot of sense, as do focus items.  It's merely the implementation of the latter that many of us take issue with.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
This also applies to melee, of course.  But since melee can get effects like haste without having to resort to "old crap," there's no reason to make casters resort to "old crap" for their focus effects, either.  It's also a double whammy...under the current system, casters have to use "old crap" for their caster effects, AND use lower level spells to get the benefit of the effects.   At least under my system, the simple tradeoff of going for "old crap" items to get a useful effect would be in place.  <br>
<br>
Sort of like a high level warrior forced to use a FBSS for the haste if no upgrade were available.  The parallel to the current caster situation is to force the tank to use a FS weapon with the FBSS to get the benefit of the haste.<br>

That is exactly it.<br>
<br>
I have a Gorganga (spelling?) Idol in my range slot. To become a more efficent healer I have to downgrade, lose 40hp, and get an Idol of the Underking.<br>
<br>
Another complaint I have to agree with are the effects not matching the item, and higher end items with lower level effects.<br>
<br>
My NoS is a perfect example. Spell haste is good, don't get me wrong. But the only spells I cast on a daily basis that it effects are teleports. Not evacs, because I use Succor. Just ports. All of my nukes / heals / buffs etc etc are too high level to be effected.<br>
<br>
Shadel Bandit Ring. It has the same effect on it as the Magician Quest robe. The ring drops in a 50+ zone. The Robe is a level 32 quest. Same effects. <p><center><i> Baroness Elawnah Zhir`Venhiruum</i><br>
