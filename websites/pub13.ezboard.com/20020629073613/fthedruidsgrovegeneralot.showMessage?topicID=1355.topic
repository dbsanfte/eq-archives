Man, was i surprised at how good it was, and really dont get all the criticism.  I went into it having read all the critiques saying how the acting was awful, how it and Phantom Menace sucked, etc. etc.  There is no way you can even compare this to Phantom Menace, its so much better.  I rate it a tie with Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars.  Then probably comes Star Wars, Return of the Jedi, and then that joke Phantom Menace.  I was definitely surprised at how good it was, even though the jokes were bad.<br>
<br>
I'll say i loved watching Yoda fight.  I'm just hoping the next one has more of Yoda bouncing all over the place, i was laughing but loving it.  They should put out a whole new series revolving around Yoda!!  2 thumbs up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucolcannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colcannon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/1/02 12:35:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1355.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bippiboy.com/images/stuff/homesm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hummm, no Attack of the Clones thread?  </span><hr size=1> Overall, I thought it was good. I'm not a film editor or anything, but I really think they could've cut the obligatory video game sequences (ie, the droid factory) and made the film a lot tighter.<br>
<br>
I think the film REALLY took off when Obi-wan, Anakin and Padme are finally reunited. If the film had the pacing of that last 30-45 minutes, I think it would've been much better.<br>

<br>
It was better than I, but the acting was not very good -- you know who I am talking about. <br>
<br>
Goofy love scenes. Bleh. /yawn<br>
<br>
The last part was the best, and I agree with Colcannon; the entire movie should've had a nicer pace. <br>
<br>
Tie with <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>? No way. Empire, although an "inbetween" movie, had some of the most memorable scenes and dialog in the entire series. The confrontation between Luke and Vader was one of the scenes I'll always remember from childhood moviewatching; Prowse's body language was awesome and even if you could see no face, Prowse's gestures and the voice of James Earl Jones perfectly communicated emotion and clarity of thought. <br>
<br>
Regarding the mainstream press critiques of the film, well, those critics are hardly your "average" Star Wars viewer (whatever that means) or Lucas fanboys. If the movie was good, it was good on its own merits and not because it was "Star Wars." I think a lot of critics sometimes have a bit of trouble reviewing movies for their intended audience. I am guilty of thinking of "movies" as both entertainment and art (form) and tend to like "films," not "movies." /shrug  It's my personal preference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueckointhedarkness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecko in the darkness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/1/02 8:22:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1355.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hummm, no Attack of the Clones thread?  </span><hr size=1>   The only actor that looked like they were having fun was Yoda.  Some scenes were to long, like the first chase scene of the assasin, and especially the scene where they were all running around the assembly line.  Clones versus Droids had no emotional pull.  At least the evil ones had fun.<br>
  The whole new series is missing a pirate/smuggler.  The &quot;FUN&quot; character of Han Solo with his total lack of faith in the force was the character I identified with.<br>

This is recently unearthed dialogue from The Empire Strikes Back. I did edit out a 'gay = dumb' analogy lots of folks seem to use. <br>
<br>
<br>
<B>A furious light sabre duel is under way. DARTH VADER is backing LUKE SKYWALKER toward the end of the gantry. A quick move by Vader, chops off Luke's hand! It goes spinning off into the ventilation shaft. Luke looks round, but realizes there's nowhere to go but straight down.<br>
<br>
DARTH VADER: "Obi Wan never told you what happened to your father."<br>
LUKE: "He told me enough! He told me you killed him!"<br>
DARTH VADER: "No! I am your father!" <br>
LUKE: "No, that's not true! That's impossible." <br>
DARTH VADER: "Search your feelings; you know it to be true." <br>
LUKE: "NO!" <br>
DARTH VADER: "Yes, it is true and you know what else? You know that annoying brass droid of yours?"<br>
LUKE: "Threepio?"<br>
DARTH VADER: "Yes, Threepio, I built him when I was 7 years old."<br>
LUKE: "No."<br>
DARTH VADER: "Seven years old! And what have you done? Look at yourself, no hand, no job, and couldn't even levitate your own ship out of the swamp."<br>
LUKE: "I destroyed your precious Death Star!"<br>
DARTH VADER: "When you were 20! When I was 10, I single-handedly destroyed a Trade Federation Droid Control ship!"<br>
LUKE: "Well, it's not my fault." <br>
DARTH VADER: "Oh, here we go. 'Poor me, my father never gave me what I wanted for my birthday, boo hoo, my daddy's the Dark Lord of the Sith...waahhh wahhh!' You make me sick."<br>
LUKE: "Shut up!"<br>
DARTH VADER: "You're a slacker! By the time I was your age, I had exterminated the Jedi Knights!" <br>
LUKE: "I used to race my T-16 through Beggar's Canyon!"<br>
DARTH VADER: "Oh, for the love of God, 10 years old, winner of the Boonta Eve Open. Only human to ever fly a Pod Racer, right here baby!"<br>
<br>
Luke looks down the shaft. Takes a step toward it. <br>
DARTH VADER: "I was wrong. You're not my kid. I don't know whose you are, but you sure ain't mine. Get out of my sight, you loser!"<br>
<br>
Luke takes a step off the platform, hesitates, then plunges down the shaft. Darth Vader looks after him.<br>
<br>
DARTH VADER: "AND GET A HAIRCUT!"<br>

And, then become Darth Vader and destroy the Jedi.<br>

Call this a SW movie? PUH-LEESE!!! The amount of Clichés alone in the movie made me want to puke. I'm a die hard SW fan since the originals came out in 77 (yeah, I'm that old), and neither TPM or AotC are SW films. G Lucas has lost the touch. Apart from 1 or 2 scenes where I had to force myself to feel something everything else was bad.<br>
Oh, and Amidala could not be pregnant. Anakin doesn't know he has twins. He says so in RotJ. 'Obi Wan was wise to hide you from me at birth'... or something to this effect. remember?<br>
I could rant and rant and rant about it and point at every bad thing there was, but that would take me a few hours, and I don't have more than a few seconds to waste on yet another waste of film Lucas has made. Damn him.<br>

<br>
People who are not have emotion.<br>
<br>
Lucas tried to offset that in E1, with Jar Jar, I suppose, but with a huge backlash.<br>
<br>
He muzzled Jar Jar, and made no attempt to replace him with some other emotion channel.<br>
<br>
Pad, was still doing emotionless, a part of the character granted, Queen Amadala acting.<br>
<br>
The only one who was allowed to show any emotion was Ani, but he pulled it off with the finesse of a soap opera casting call reject.  <br>
<br>
Young Boba Fett was a better actor,,,and you had more empathy for him, than ANY other character in the movie, well I did.<br>
<br>
When every single character in the movie is deliberately  not supposed to show emotion,,,you got one hell of a problem making a classic movie like E4.<br>
<br>
Mind you I like the movie,,,it was just dry as dirt.<br>

<br>
My GOD did the acting ever suck in this movie!<br>
<br>
As the star of the movie, they could have done a much, much better job of picking an Anakin. Peeee-EEWW, his acting stinky!<br>
<br>
All the lines were delivered deadpan, even from the non-jedi characters.  And what is with Saruman playing the part of the bad Jedi?<br>
<br>
And was it just me, or did Yoda sound painfully like someone doing a Yoda immitation voice???  That really sucked.  <br>
<br>
The SFX were ok, not what I would expect out of LA.  Some were nicer than others, most of the beasties looked like CGI monsters we have all come to know and love as CGI.  The worst example of the heavy-handed CGI was with Amidala riding the beast that was pulling the chariot behind it.  They could have EASILY used a claymation beast and a barbie doll on its back, and saved about $200,00 in CGI for that shot!  Ugh!<br>
<br>
All in all, I wasn't going in expecting much.  And I was still disappointed.<br>
