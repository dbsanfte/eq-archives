Some people think since they are such and such a level they automatically deserve some level of respect.  Well, I don't subscribe to that point of view at all.  Everyone has to earn their respect through their everyday actions, not just how well they can raid or how often they do.  I have met some great players that are under level 30 but because they don't have the time it takes to get to 50  they never make it that far.  It's pretty sad to see people stereotype players like this.  <br>
<br>
  I am one of the people out there that does enjoy doing things myself, I am a TRUEB not a nOOb.  What's the difference?  A trueb is someone brand new to the game that has actually, (cough) NEVER been twinked.  It's a hard tough road when you don't have friends in uber guilds making sure you have the best stuff for your current level range, and it is a LOT of fun.  I put up with my friends constantly slamming me because I didn't come to &quot;his&quot; server (Tarrew Marr) where he has a 58 monk and a 58 shaman he could have PL'd me with.  I decided to take the long hard journey, and I am SURE there are others that have traversed this road.  I also made a (cough) Intel caster my first character.  Oh yeah, talk about people constantly telling me how stupid it was for me to make an intel caster my first character.  Well, I managed to suffer through to 41, and half way to 42 now.  Been playing since April, could be in the 50's within a month or so.  I don't think that I've done too bad getting my levels since I do work full time.  Equipment on the other hand has much to be desired.  I in fact am still wearing at least 4 pieces of cloth or slightly better armor.<br>
<br>
  Try not to lump all us up and comers together.  We are most definitely not all the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umoghedancarns.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moghedan Carns</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.starlance.com/mw4/images/logos/cncnew.gif height=15 width=15 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/15/01 2:20:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fashion/Steel_Troll_Male.jpg hieght=74 width=54></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sad......</span><hr size=1> Well, I have been here forever (since the server opened) but never had a respectable level character till now.  Where does that lump me? =)<br>
<br>
Seriously, I think you missed the point of the orignal poster.  There was once a time when getting to 50 was a friggen miracle.  There were only 3 zones you can fight in above level 35 for XP.  The absolute best weapons and armor that could be gotten at that time are now considered to be barely fit for twinking.  There were few others in the zone, making those zones all the more dangerous.  Everyone had a multi death night at least once a week, with dang few rezzes.  Most of the never fail tactics used today had not been developed yet.  And there were no 0-60 in 30 days or less quick help guides.<br>
<br>
Today, you can hit 50 without ever having stepped in a dungeon.  They have equipment that lets them take and deal the damage of a whole group of former warriors.  (Just imagine being proud of 900 AC, FULLY BUFFED.  An 8/24 sword was the GOD of 1HS.  25/40 was the unrealized dream for most 2HS users.  Ice Comet was still broken, and Rend did not exist.  The Holy Grail... aka the Fanged Skull Stilletto 12/22, was the often rumored but rarely found uber weapon of the century.).  He is right, the people coming up today, as a general rule, do not have the expeirence or skills to replace those who are leaving, because they have not had to work nearly as hard to get there.  That is not an opinion, it is an undisputable fact.<br>

When I was that level, the Plane of Hate was a hazard, Lower Guk was where all the xp was, and a Nagafen raid was still something to be feared and respected.  Now, with two more continents and another planet opening up, there are just so many uber items out there, they don't know what it is to suffer through with meager equipment.<br>
