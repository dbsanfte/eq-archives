HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Off topic from the Cop beating thread in the general forum</span><hr size=1> Is alcoholism/addiction a disease or a weakness?<br>
<br>
I offer a third alternative:<br>
<br>
By calling it a disease, addicts can distance themselves from self loathing and proceed with recovery and behavoir modification which is part of all successful recovery routines. The displacement of the addiction into it being a progressive illness empowers the addict to understand addiction and recover without the often self destructive connotations that came with calling substance abuse a &quot;weakness&quot; or &quot;character flaw&quot; that often lead to failure and the return to abuse.<br>
<br>
Ultimately the process of recovery is to learn how to deal with addictions, real life, and move on to find better avenues or dealing with life. Whether it's a character flaw, a weakness, a disease, or a failure to learn as a person young in life how to deal with problems is completely beside the point. It's recovery, sobriety, coping methods, and self help methods that leads to long term recovery that matters. So labling it as a disease only enables the recovery process. And ultimately it's about saving a person's life that is what matters the most.<br>
<br>
Self help groups and professionals by treating addictions as a disease help the recovering addict to distance themselves from the addiction and look for ways and methods to help themselves. It's far to easy to say &quot;just stop using&quot; and expect that as the cure all answer. Not a single health professional at the time AA started could offer anything else other than saying, &quot;just stop drinking and everything will get better.&quot; Time and time again those people who never learn to distance themselves from addiction by calling it a disease or illness begin to think that they are the problem, not the substance. The two are intertwined, the vicious circle of self loathing, low self-esteem, regret, etc only add to the addiction's hold on an individual. One feeds upon the other. <br>
<br>
That is why the 12 step and affliated programs work. They don't focus on the person faults as much as how addiction affects the person and empowers them through admitting their addiction is a disease and being powerless alone to fight it that leads them to recovery. It say to them,&quot;Hey! it's not you, it's the disease! Stop fighting it, surrender, and work the program and you'll get better!&quot;<br>
<br>
Millions upon millions of people in every 12 step program from AA to Sex Anonymous and in over 100 countries treat and talk about addiction as a disease and it works for them. So why deny that this method and thinking works?<br>
<br>
Flame on!<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  According to the biologists among those researching this field, addiction is an attempt to rectify a shortage of the body's own pleasure inducing agents by means of ingesting or injecting chemical substances, which will restore the supposedly &quot;normal&quot; state. The lack of the body's own pleasure inducing agents can be either innate or acquired. If it exists, any compensation by chemical means will trigger a mechanism that destroys physiological equilibrium and causes a &quot;lifelong allergy&quot; towards the drug concerned. <br>
<br>
Addiction is seen as a dysfunction within the body's own &quot;reward system&quot;. Research has shown that in alcoholics and heroin addicts the &quot;reward substance&quot; Endorphin is three times lower than in healthy individuals, while the stress hormone is four times higher. Stress tolerance depends on the ratio of the two substances. Too much stress hormone and lack of Endorphin causes pronounced depression in addicts. <br>
<br>
While this anomaly may be innate, unfortunately it is further aggravated by years of alcohol consumption. The condition may also be acquired by regular and excessive alcohol consumption, and remain chronic. It cannot be predicted who will be affected in this way. <br>
<br>
Biochemical research has succeeded in illuminating and underpinning the addiction process, the irreversibility of addiction, and the phenomenon of withdrawal. How can this help us in practice?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The article closes with a paragraph on the dangers of relapse in this context. It is quoted here, slightly shortened, because it points to an important consequence: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Apart from the biochemical mechanism of the addiction process, there is still the Endorphin deficit in the sober state, which led to the addiction in the first place and which provides motivation for a relapse. This requires specific and targeted psychological work which will enable patients to endure and persevere with abstinence. There is little point in preaching &quot;frustration tolerance&quot; to addicts who already suffer a lack of reward agents, and to dismiss their desire for more support as a &quot;demanding attitude. <br>
<br>
We should remember that in the brain there are several reward systems which use various trigger substances to provide different kinds of euphoria. Is it possible to replace one kind of euphoria with another? <br>
<br>
Lack of Endorphin (which merely triggers a basic biological euphoria) can be compensated by an appeal to higher functions. In other words: The present policy of encouraging addicts to find creative work and hobbies is correct. In this way they are able to experience another kind of reward. <br>
<br>
The restoration of a sense of personal worth in addicts means the beginning of a new life and new interests. The self-confidence of an addict is totally destroyed by the circumstances of the addiction. After withdrawal the patient has to recall the healthy components of his/her personality. There is no doubt that he/she needs help with this.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=57292" target="_new"><img src="http://home.ch.inter.net/baratte/sig2.gif" alt="Sherazade" border="0"></a><br>

<br>
I would like to know the periodical you got those quotes from however for future reference! My comments are an extemporaneous discourse that possibly offer a viable concensus that those of the disease and weakness factions can agree upon.<br>
<br>
More questions come to mind knowing that the many faceted problem that is addiction, substance abuse, and compulsive behavior must be realized in context to your offerings.<br>
<br>
Within the guides of withdrawal that addicts go through in detoxification that are common and well documented, there are considerations to be made as to the drug of choice they use. The body has a tendancy to compensate for the depressant or stimulant effect of a substance by over producing certain chemicals to offset the affects of the substance. If you use a depressant, your body tries to produce stimulants to compensate. This is also part of the addiction process. Once the drug wears off you feel overstimulated which reinforces the desire to take more depressants. The reverse is is true with stimulants.<br>
<br>
With certain drugs that are considered physically dependant, the withdrawal and the body's readjustment chemically can be fatal without proper supervision, such as with narcotics. This just places emphasis upon the need in severe circumstances to seek additional outside help when a person &quot;dries out&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now comes the question, &quot;Which came first, the chicken or the egg?&quot;<br>
<br>
Is the chemical imbalance after the recovery begins a result of the addiction or result of genetic problems that manifested themselves as an addiction?<br>
<br>
The question is purely academic. Regardless of the causes of addiction from chemical, to genetic, to environment, or even pre-disposition through exposure in drug related environments or abuse as a child the ultimate goal is recovery. That's why the medical community often has a problem with the most successful programs, they can't catagorize them into neat academic packages.<br>
