FAQ Updates - May 17, 2001<br>
<br>
3.32 Do my attributes change over time?<br>
Yes, they change over time, but the total amount of points never increases. Instead, you set targets for what you want your attributes to become, and they migrate there over time. You want to do this in order to shift the nature of your character. Many skills will have attribute prerequisites.<br>
<br>
From the Recent Developer’s Boards<br>

<br>
6.26 Does food serve any purpose in the game beyond simply satisfying a game-enforced simulation of reality (i.e. hunger)?<br>
Yes, food is also capable of temporarily buffing (and lowering) each of the six attributes a character has.<br>

<br>
1. General Information<br>
<br>
1.01 Who is developing the game?<br>
<br>
Star Wars Galaxies is being developed by Sony Online Entertainment and LucasArts Entertainment Company. The core development team includes some of the most talented developers from both Ultima Online and EverQuest, the two most successful massively multiplayer games to date.<br>
<br>
1.02 What is the game going to be like? <br>
<br>
First and foremost, it is going to be Star Wars. We are trying to capture as many aspects as possible of life in that Universe. Players will be able to fight stormtroopers, hang out in a cantina, build droids, and explore the galaxy... We want each player to become whatever he or she wants to be, from a shop owner to a bounty hunter to a galactic hero, or even all of the above. <br>
<br>
1.03 Is this a multiplayer-only game?<br>
<br>
Yes, this is a massively multiplayer online game set in the Star Wars universe. You play a character in a virtual universe. Players will be able to adventure solo while online; grouping is not required. (That is not to say that players will be able to play &quot;Han Solo&quot; however)<br>
<br>
1.04 What is a MMORPG?<br>
<br>
MMORPG is a terribly long acronym for &quot;Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game&quot;. It is used to classify games like EverQuest and Ultima Online.<br>
<br>
1.05 Will this be EverQuest in Space?<br>
<br>
No. Star Wars Galaxies is being designed from the ground up to be its own game. Although many of our designers have learned a great deal from games such as EverQuest, Ultima Online and Meridian 59, we are dedicated to making a new game designed to work well with the Star Wars universe.<br>
<br>
1.06 Will there be a fee to play in addition to buying the game?<br>
<br>
To pay for ongoing costs such as live team salaries, bandwidth consumption and customer service, there will likely be a subscription fee. The amount will not be determined until we are closer to shipping the game.<br>
<br>
1.07 Will there be updates and/or expansions? Will they be free and downloadable or will they come in a box at the store?<br>
<br>
The answer is most definitely both updates and expansion packs. We will have boxed expansions because you just can't get press attention or more shelf space or serious marketing without a new box. We also can't do really big additions that involve large amounts of data without a new CD. At the same time though, we’ll provide regular free updates to the product that will go beyond simple bug patches.<br>
<br>
1.08 What if I don't have a lot of time to play this game? Will I still be able to play with my friends who do? <br>
<br>
We wanted to avoid power differentials that prevent hard-core gamers and the more casual gamers from playing together, so the two will be able to play together fruitfully. <br>
<br>
1.09 Do I have to be a &quot;twitchy&quot; gamer to succeed in Star Wars Galaxies?<br>
<br>
No. The term &quot;twitchy&quot; refers to quick reflexes and gaming skills such as those required in first-person-shooter style games. Star Wars Galaxies does not require a player to have these skills to succeed. <br>
<br>
1.10 Can I play with a modem, or will I need a broadband connection?<br>
<br>
Our goal is to allow you to be able to play with a modem.<br>
<br>
1.11 Will Star Wars Galaxies be a PC only game?<br>
<br>
We are currently designing the game for the PC, but we haven't ruled out any of the other platforms. We will let you know of any definitive plans for a port of the game as soon as they emerge.<br>
<br>
1.12 Why call it “Galaxies” instead of “Galaxy”? <br>
<br>
The answer is two-fold. First, we intend on releasing multiple titles under the Star Wars Galaxies line. Secondly, we will be using multiple servers/galaxies as opposed to attempting a game with one shared galaxy. The decision to break up versions of the game was based on a number of factors, but it basically comes down to content. It would not be possible for us to generate enough content, to the level of detail we want and with the high quality the fans expect, for everyone to play in the same space. <br>
<br>
1.13 Will there be servers outside of the United States? <br>
<br>
We are talking to several ISP partners in Asia and Europe. Our current thoughts are to have servers located in different parts of the world. It is too early to give you exact locations. We are going to localize our game into different languages. We have not decided which languages to release with.<br>

 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Setting and Environment<br>
<br>
2.01 How many planets will there be in the game?<br>
<br>
We're still finalizing the list of planets and locations, but players will be able to visit many familiar Star Wars sites such as Tatooine and Naboo, as well as some never-before-seen worlds from the expanded Star Wars universe!<br>
<br>
<br>
2.02 When in the Star Wars timeline is this game set?<br>
<br>
The game takes place during the Galactic Civil War, which fans refer to as the &quot;Classic Era&quot;, in reference to the &quot;Classic (or Original) Trilogy.&quot; We haven't pinpointed the exact point on the timeline yet, but the game will definitely take place after the destruction of the first Death Star and the Battle of Yavin. <br>
<br>
2.03 Why did you choose the &quot;Classic Era&quot; as a setting?<br>
<br>
There are several reasons for this choice in setting for Star Wars Galaxies:<br>
<br>
There’s a massive conflict going on. The struggle between the Empire and the Alliance gives us a perfect backdrop for an MMO. The Empire is still incredibly powerful, but the Alliance is growing, too, as new systems join the resistance movement.<br>
Aside from Obi-Wan, all of the major and secondary characters are still alive and kicking. We can include familiar characters if we want.<br>
Many of the major locations are intact or have recently been discovered. If we decide to build Jabba’s Palace, complete with Jabba and his crew, we don’t need to worry about whether he’s moved in yet or whether he’s dead…<br>
There’s a wealth of Expanded Universe sources that cover this time period. These sources provide great inspiration and reference, which we’ll need if we want to create an immersive MMO.<br>
2.04 Are you going to use the Star Wars Expanded Universe?<br>
<br>
We will be drawing from the Star Wars expanded universe (comics, games, novels, etc.) where appropriate and possible.<br>
<br>
2.05 Are there zones like in EQ?<br>
<br>
Not exactly. The &quot;zone model&quot; doesn't really apply to Star Wars Galaxies. We will have contained areas designed for exploration, combat, player interaction, and travel, but the transitions between these areas will be seamless and automatic. Players will feel like they are adventuring across large sections of a planet, rather than hopping from zone to zone. Each world will have several areas, including settlements and wild regions. <br>
<br>
2.06 Will the game include space travel? <br>
<br>
Yes. We will have multiple planets upon launch and the initial product will provide players with methods for moving between these planets. The expansion will allow players to own starships for travel and combat.<br>
<br>
2.07 How much gore will be in the game?<br>
<br>
You can expect that the level of gore and violence in SWG will be similar to the level of &quot;gore&quot; in other LucasArts products, such as Dark Forces and Jedi Knight. We certainly understand that combat is violent in the Star Wars universe (and elsewhere), but none of our games contain gratuitous gore or bloodshed. Basically, we take our lead from the films - the &quot;gore&quot; in the game probably won't exceed anything you've seen in The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, for example.<br>
<br>
2.08 Will there be music in the game? <br>
<br>
Yes, the game will have a soundtrack reminiscent of the Star Wars films.<br>
<br>
2.09 Will there be a profanity filter of some sort in the game? <br>
<br>
A profanity filter will definitely be in the game. You will be able to decide whether to use it, what additional words go into it, as well as be able to password it so that it can be used as a parental control.<br>
<br>
2.10 Will the game contain content from Episode I?<br>
<br>
All five films can be considered our primary resources. We're using a ton of material from Episode I-expect to see Episode I technology, aliens, and even high-level concepts in Star Wars Galaxies. We're also going to drop in some Episode II content as it becomes available.<br>
<br>
2.11 Will you be making complete, round planets?<br>
<br>
We opted for variety (i.e. several different worlds) rather than size (one or two “complete” worlds). There’s just no way that we could build more than one or two entire worlds with the level of detail that we’re seeking, and we felt that players would rather be able to travel to multiple worlds than simply circumnavigate a single planet.<br>

3. Characters and Skills<br>
<br>
3.01 Can I play a Wookiee?<br>
<br>
Yes, you can play a Wookiee, or choose from seven other familiar Star Wars species (Human, Zabrak, Mon Calamari, Bothan, Rodian, Trandoshan, and Twi'lek). Each species will have strengths and weaknesses, but this won't limit a player's options or advancement within the game. <br>
<br>
3.02 Can I be Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia?<br>
<br>
No. To preserve the continuity of the fiction, you will not be able to play the key figures in the Star Wars universe. However, you may cross paths with a few of them…<br>
<br>
3.03 Will I be able to kill Darth Vader?<br>
<br>
At this point, you will probably not be able to kill Darth Vader, but some players may have the opportunity to interact with him. We would like to adhere to the continuity as much as possible; Vader is key to the trilogy, so you probably won’t be able to kill him (like you would really stand a chance against the Lord of the Sith anyway…)<br>
<br>
3.04 Will Star Wars Galaxies use a skill-based system or a level-based system with classes?<br>
<br>
Star Wars Galaxies will use a skill-based system with skill trees, and we'll have a wide range of skill trees and professions, including combat, crafting, and politics. Players will open up new capabilities as they advance by acquiring new skills. Specialized skills will require mastery of the lower-level skills in the tree, and skills may also require other sorts of prerequisites. You will not have to engage in combat to advance (well, except for combat, of course!).<br>
<br>
3.05 Will my character be based on a pre-defined archetype or &quot;class?&quot; <br>
<br>
No. We want to give players the freedom to create characters with a wide range of skills and abilities. Characters will be defined primarily by the skills they possess and the types of activities they pursue, and not by &quot;classes.&quot; We're hoping this results in thousands of unique characters with their own individual strengths.<br>
<br>
3.06 Will there be name constraints or professional titles?<br>
<br>
We will enforce name constraints to help promote a Star Wars atmosphere. You will not see LuukSkywalker777 running around. We do intend on allowing players to attain professional titles based on the skills they choose to focus on.<br>
<br>
3.07 Will role-playing be promoted in Star Wars Galaxies?<br>
<br>
We wanted to set the expectation early on that this would be an environment conducive to role-play. However, role-playing is not mandatory.<br>
<br>
3.08 Will my character's species affect my skill selection?<br>
<br>
No. We feel that players in Star Wars Galaxies should have the freedom to create the characters that they want, regardless of species. In addition, species in Star Wars are generally as diverse as we humans, and we want to capture that feel. We don't want to pigeonhole any character into pre-defined roles, so you will be able to select from most skills available regardless of species. However, some species may receive modifiers to skills based on what they are naturally good (or bad) at doing, and a handful of skills could be limited to specific species if there is a logical, Star Wars-based reason for doing so (we might decide that only Wookiees can build and repair bowcasters, for example).<br>
<br>
3.09 Will I be able to play a healer in the game?<br>
<br>
One of the &quot;playstyles&quot; that we've identified is the &quot;healer&quot; type of player - that is, the player who enjoys taking on a support role and aiding others by healing his or her allies. As a result, we've found ways for these players to create effective characters - expect to see well-developed medical and healing skills.<br>
<br>
3.10 Will there be Dark Troopers in the game and will I be able to play one? <br>
<br>
We're still finalizing our art asset lists, but Dark Trooper is currently included as an NPC. You probably won't be able to play a Dark Trooper because they are such specialized units manufactured by the Empire (and, if you spent any time doing anything other than following the Empire's orders, you'd be AWOL). <br>
<br>
3.11 Will I be able to become a stormtrooper?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the constraints of the Imperial hierarchy prohibit us from allowing players to actually become stormtroopers in the initial launch product. Service in the Empire would be very difficult to enforce; if we did allow stormtroopers, players would constantly be AWOL as they explored other aspects of the game. Rest assured, however, that players will be able to serve the Empire in many other ways.<br>
<br>
3.12 How many species will be available for me to play?<br>
<br>
We will feature eight playable species for the release of the game. We whittled down the long list to eight finalists, which will provide a great deal of diversity and balance to the game. The eight playable species are: Wookiee, Zabrak, Human, Bothan, Rodian, Mon Calamari, Trandoshan, and Twi'lek. We hope to add additional playable species with future products in the Star Wars Galaxies line.<br>
<br>
3.13 What kind of help will be available to newbies in the game?<br>
<br>
There will be a “Newbie Hall” (for lack of a better term), where new players can get their feet wet and begin exploring some of the game mechanics. We’re also hoping that the interface will be very intuitive to cut down on some of the common problems new players face when jumping into a complex MMO. Finally, there will be systems in place that actually encourage seasoned players to help out new players.<br>
<br>
3.14 Will there be varied races within a species? <br>
<br>
We’re planning to allow for a wide range of races within species, where it makes sense and fits within the continuity. Twi'leks are a good example of this - there are several different types, with a variety of skin coloration. <br>
<br>
3.15 Will there be species in the game that are not playable? <br>
<br>
A ton. Our NPC aliens list is pretty extensive. <br>
<br>
3.16 How will skill advancement work?<br>
<br>
Each skill will cost skill points. You can only acquire so many skills before you are not allowed to learn any more. The total number of skills you can acquire, however, will depend on what sorts of skills you learn. The higher up any tree you go, the more all future skills will cost to learn. Likewise, the broader across all professions you go, the more all future skills will cost to learn. The cheapest paths are to go either straight up (specializing) or straight across (jack of all trades). If you try to specialize in multiple areas, each skill will cost more skill points, and you will run out of points sooner.<br>
<br>
3.17 What sorts of prerequisites will skills have?<br>
<br>
A character may be required to have one or more of the following things before they can learn a certain skill: Other related skills, certain usage level of those related skills, the completion of required missions, money for training, certain level of attributes, and certain standings with a faction or NPC guild. In rare cases, they may be limited by their species. <br>
<br>
3.18 Can I learn partial skill trees?<br>
<br>
Yes. You can stop climbing a skill tree whenever you want. If you choose to use your skill points to learn a wider range of skills, you can dabble in multiple skill trees.<br>
<br>
3.19 If I choose a skill, then later realize I don’t like it, will I be stuck with it for the rest of the game?<br>
<br>
You can always give up a skill in order to apply those points towards something that you find more interesting and useful. So, if you put X skill points into Wookiee grooming and later realize that Wookiee grooming really isn’t your idea of a good time, you can always give up that skill to get those points back and put them into something more useful, like blaster repair.<br>
<br>
3.20 Will mining be in the game as a potential player pursuit? If so, will it be a skill, a series of skills, or will it simply be a question of having the proper equipment?<br>
<br>
Yes, mining will be part of the game as a player pursuit. You’ll probably need to have points invested in at least one mining-related skill tree *and* the proper equipment in order to mine stuff.<br>
<br>
3.21 Do I earn skill points kind of like experience points in EQ?<br>
<br>
No. You start with all the skill points you will ever have. However, you won't be able to use them all right off the bat. You have to qualify to get skills.<br>
<br>
3.22 Will my skills atrophy from lack of use?<br>
<br>
No, you never lose a skill box from inactivity. However, being at a certain level of familiarity with a skill is a prerequisite to advancing to a higher skill in the tree, generally, and inactivity can cost you that.<br>
<br>
3.23 How will my character’s attributes affect skills?<br>
<br>
Attributes can serve as prerequisites for skills. They can also affect skill rolls. There are no “levels” within a skill (a skill box is a &quot;have it or don't&quot; thing).<br>
<br>
3.24 For basic actions like shooting a blaster, will I need to have the appropriate skill just to perform them?<br>
<br>
For something like firing a blaster, everyone knows how to do it. The skill itself serves to enhance the basic ability. A semantic difference, you might think, but an important one.<br>
<br>
3.25 Can I choose to “skip” some skills in my skill tree but still continue to advance through it?<br>
<br>
There are subspecialties within professions that you can choose to skip if you're not interested in them. For example, there are skills specific to particular models of blaster. You might become a master marksman, but not pick up model-specific skills.<br>
<br>
3.26 Is my character going to be weaker than a womp rat when I start out?<br>
<br>
Given some basic fighting skills that you can pick up as a newbie, you should be able to take on more substantial opponents than womp rats. We agree with the common player feeling that &quot;being weaker than a rabbit sucks.&quot;<br>
<br>
3.27 Will the acquisition of certain skills in one skill tree require that I have skills from other trees as prerequisites? <br>
<br>
Yes. Some skill trees, such as bounty hunting, for example, aren't even available to you until you reach a certain point in other trees that serve as prerequisites.<br>
<br>
3.28 What are the main attributes of a character?<br>
<br>
There are three bars that you pay attention to while playing: your Health, your Action, and your Mind. We usually call these your “pools.” There are six attributes that affect these pools: Strength, Constitution, Quickness, Stamina, Focus, and Willpower. Different species have different maximums and minimums for these attributes.<br>
<br>
3.29 Will solo characters be able to attain a high or maximum set of skills in skill trees without the need to group with other characters?<br>
<br>
For the most part, yes. We want soloing to be viable in Star Wars Galaxies, so we’re going to do our best to support solo players in various ways. There will be a handful of skill trees that require grouping and some other skills will rely on player interaction, but a solo character should be able to climb just as high in “blaster repair” as a character who groups. There may even be skills that can only be improved while soloing.<br>
<br>
3.30 How do attributes work in character creation?<br>
<br>
When a character is created, you get to distribute points into all nine of the statistics. We’ll provide some templates for quick creation and also random rolls if you prefer that method.<br>
<br>
3.31 How do attributes work during gameplay?<br>
<br>
You’ll need to pay attention to all three pools-you can be incapacitated via attacks on any of the three. This is to ensure that every character has strengths and weaknesses. Use of skills takes points from the relevant pool; for example, a feat of strength may well use up Health. The rate of expenditure from a pool and the rate at which the pool refreshes are based on your attributes. For example, Strength affects how much Health a particular action costs, and Constitution affects how fast your Health comes back.<br>
<br>
3.32 Do my attributes change over time?<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, they change over time, but the total amount of points never increases. Instead, you set targets for what you want your attributes to become, and they migrate there over time. You want to do this in order to shift the nature of your character. Many skills will have attribute prerequisites.<br>

4. Jedi and Lightsabers<br>
<br>
4.01 Will I be able to play a Jedi?<br>
<br>
Yes. Although the details are still being worked out, we are staying true to the spirit of the films. Therefore, the journey to become a Jedi will be difficult, but those players who choose this path with find it very rewarding.<br>
<br>
4.02 Will there be numerical limit on the number of Jedi allowed on each server?<br>
<br>
No. We're not using artificial means such as quotas or caps to limit the Jedi population. We're designing an organic system that will allow the Jedi population to fluctuate over time.<br>
<br>
4.03 Will only the extremely lucky or hardcore players get to play Jedi?<br>
<br>
We are not “pre-determining” whether a character can become a Jedi or not. Also, being “hardcore” is not a qualifier used in becoming a Jedi. Our system is designed to allow the casual player, as well as the hardcore player, the opportunity to become a Jedi.<br>
<br>
4.04 Can I become a Dark Jedi? <br>
<br>
Yes. We're creating the Jedi system to take into account Dark Jedi. However, be warned that the life of a Dark Jedi will be very perilous... <br>
<br>
4.05 Is it possible for other species to become Jedi? <br>
<br>
Yes. Any character, regardless of species, has the potential to become a Jedi. <br>
<br>
4.06 How will Force powers be implemented? <br>
<br>
Force powers will function much like skills in Star Wars Galaxies - we're actually using the same basic set of rules for both systems. Like skills, Force powers will be divided into several &quot;trees&quot; (or &quot;spheres&quot;), allowing players to select specific powers and areas of focus. <br>
<br>
4.07 If I am a Jedi with a lightsaber, will I be able to block blaster shots and perform other cool lightsaber tricks?<br>
<br>
Lightsabers will have all the same capabilities as those seen in the film, but a lightsaber doesn't automatically confer special abilities to the wielder - a Jedi will still need the proper skills and training to master things like &quot;blaster reflection.&quot; <br>
<br>
4.08 Can I build my own lightsaber? <br>
<br>
Yes, but we’re following a few simple rules that have been established by the continuity of Star Wars such as: Only Jedi can manufacture lightsabers. Building a lightsaber is difficult. Only Jedi can use lightsabers effectively. A Jedi is more skilled with his or her personal lightsaber than with a “borrowed” lightsaber. <br>
<br>
4.09 How long will it take a Jedi to construct his lightsaber? <br>
<br>
This will probably come down to balancing, with our starting duration based on the continuity. We don't want lightsabers to be really easy/quick to produce, but we also don't want it to take an inordinate amount of time. According to continuity, it took Luke quite some time to build his lightsaber on Tatooine and he &quot;failed&quot; many attempts. But, he was also working in a relative vacuum, without a Master and only Obi-Wan's journal to guide him. The time it takes to actually build a lightsaber will also likely be affected by the Jedi's various skills and how &quot;strong&quot; the character is with the Force. <br>
<br>
4.10 Can I make a double-bladed lightsaber? <br>
<br>
Learning how to build a double-sided lightsaber will likely be more difficult than learning how to build a normal lightsaber. You will also probably need more components (additional crystals, for example). And, we may make it more difficult to learn how to wield the weapon effectively, since so few Jedi have spent the time necessary to master the double-bladed lightsaber, and it is so rare during the original trilogy's time period. <br>
<br>
4.11 Can I choose what color my lightsaber will be? <br>
<br>
We will offer multiple lightsaber colors. <br>
<br>
4.12 Will I be able to turn off my lightsaber? <br>
<br>
You will be able to deactivate your lightsaber, but carrying the hilt around might still attract attention. <br>
<br>
4.13 Can lightsabers get old and “break”? <br>
<br>
We will have item decay in the game, and this will affect lightsabers as well. However, a Jedi has the knowledge necessary to maintain a lightsaber, preventing such decay. <br>
<br>
4.14 Can I have a title like “Jedi Knight” or “Jedi Master”?<br>
<br>
We're planning to include Jedi titles, like &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; and &quot;Jedi Master&quot; in the game. Dark Jedi would likely have the same titles as the regular Jedi (Dark Jedi Knight, Dark Jedi Master)<br>
<br>
4.15 Can I become a Sith Lord in the game?<br>
<br>
No, although players may be able to become Dark Jedi, they will not be able to become Sith Lords. The films explicitly state that there are only two Sith Lords at any given time, and the two during the time of Star Wars Galaxies have been clearly identified as the Emperor and Darth Vader. <br>
