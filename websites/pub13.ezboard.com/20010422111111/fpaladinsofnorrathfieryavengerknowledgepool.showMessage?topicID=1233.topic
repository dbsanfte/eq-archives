Re: Vox and Nag strategy from Paiyn<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
here you go.....<br>
<br>
Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I’ve been asked by many people what makes my Vox/Naggy raids so successful. I figured since I’m now 53, and I don’t ever plan on de-leveling again, I would share my view and strategy with everyone. Like Chronnos did a while back with his Fear break strategy, I’m posting what has worked for me. This is by all means not the only way to do it, but this is the best way I’ve come up with. I’m not posting this to “float my own boat” or make myself look good, rather I’m trying to help others be successful with these dragons. Nothing is worse then being in the same zone when a dragon raid is going on and listening to it go bad….all that lost exp. Casters running in 12 times, people have 7 bodies disappear on them, &lt;shiver&gt;.<br>
<br>
A few things I would like to put out before we start, this is my strategy, like I said, not the only way to do it. When I say you “must”, it refers to this strategy only. There is a billion ways to do everything, this is only one of them.<br>
<br>
OK, lets start….<br>
<br>
I’ll do this in parts…<br>
<br>
Part 1 – What Class/Level you must have, and what is nice to have.<br>
Part 2 – Group Composition<br>
Part 3 – Buffing<br>
Part 4 – The Charge<br>
<br>
Here we go….<br>
<br>
PART 1 – CLASS/LEVEL <br>
<br>
What you must have…<br>
<br>
6 Clerics (at least 2 that are 52, the rest preferably over 49)<br>
6 Warriors (the higher level the better)<br>
2 Enchanters<br>
2 Bards<br>
2 Shamans<br>
4 Wizards (the more the better)<br>
2 Druids<br>
<br>
What is nice to have…<br>
<br>
Monks (you will need them for pulling the IGs/FGs, plus they do killer damage)<br>
Pet Casters (Mages and Necros)<br>
Assorted Tanks (SKs, Rogues, Pallys, Rangers)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PART 2 – GROUP COMPOSITION<br>
<br>
This is very important, my raids are 6 groups, 4 tank groups and 2 caster groups). When I put in “Tank” fill in with any Melee class, when I put in “Caster” fill in with any pet caster or wizard. Now Vox varies a little from Naggy do to the fact that Vox can CH, so groups 3 and 4 will be a little different for each dragon. When there is a * this is a must have not an option.<br>
<br>
GROUP #1 –<br>
Cleric*<br>
Cleric*<br>
Bard*<br>
Warrior*<br>

GROUP #2 –<br>

<br>
GROUP #6<br>

<br>
Now I always find it easiest to have a chart already made up of the 14 classes, where I list the Name/Lvl of everyone I have. Then I also have a group chart with all six groups listed, where I can just fill in names of those in the groups. That way it makes forming up groups much easier.<br>
<br>
PART 3 – BUFFING<br>
<br>
The worst part of the whole raid and the most time consuming. Everyone knows the buff order. 4 crap biffs, then the rest. <br>
<br>
Some things that make this part of the raid go a little faster..<br>
<br>
-        Put out the groups before you start buffing. That way you don’t have to do it in chat.<br>
-        Make someone else in charge of the buff groups and the buffing. This way you are free to do other things.<br>
-        Make 2 buff groups, that is why you have 2 shammies and 2 chanters.<br>
-        Put out the strategy while the buff groups are forming up. That way you don’t have to do it in chat. The first people in chat room probably have been there for over an hour, the last thing they want to hear is you going over all the rules before they sign back in.<br>
-        Resist gear is an important part of a Dragon raid, the people coming to your raid should work on getting all the resist gear they possibly can. Eqmaps.com has an awesome search engine that you can use to find Resist gear and where it drops.<br>
-        51 and 52 Clerics can cast Death Pact if they have the spell, believe me, this can make or break a raid. It is well worth it.<br>
-        Just because level 53 and above players can’t actually participate in the slaying of the dragon, doesn’t mean they can’t come and help buff. A few high level clerics that come along to buff is a nice addition.<br>
-        Shaman Fire and Cold resist potions also help a lot.<br>
-        Once everyone is buffed, buff groups buff themselves, then once they are full mana, all they have to do is send one person to chat to tell everyone to log back in, there is no need for the buff groups to go to chat also.<br>
<br>
Buffing is the worst part by far then anything else in a Dragon raid. Once you have run a few successful ones, you can tell all those people that are bitching about how long its taking, “Hey, I never fail, trust me, we are doing this the right way”. Under no circumstances do you not use a chat room. I have never been on a Dragon raid that was successful using the buff and go technique, you may get lucky and pull it off, but it’s not worth the risk.<br>
<br>
PART 4 – THE CHARGE<br>
<br>
Almost done, only about 5 to 10 minutes left and it’s over. Everyone is excited. But this is the most important part. Make sure that you put out that anyone that can bind, bind in the buff area, then drop some coins right at their bind point, that way if they die they pick up a few coins and run back in. This reduces the amount of experience loss, because the bodies will not disappear after three minutes. Also, pet casters can leave some components for pulling there pets at the their bind point also, that way they can pull a pet before running back in. Now, additionally, if those higher level clerics want to hang out, they can stay in the back of the buff area and quickly buff those that are running back in, this will not cause them to be ported outside of the zone because the person that they are casting on has not engaged the dragon after dieing. This is what I have found to work the best…..<br>
<br>
-        Groups 1 and 2 charge in first. They go on your command and your command only. When they run in the tanks pull the dragon to the rear of they lair. Fighting a dragon at the entrance is insta-death. Once the dragon is pulled to the rear of the lair the clerics get within casting range of the tanks and SIT. This will reduce the chance of them getting feared out of the lair. When they need to heal the stand cast and sit again. This first group has to shout out the health of the dragon in 10% increments. I have heard many times that the pet casters send the pets in first to suck up the fear spells, DO NOT do this. In order for the casters to send there pets they must be able to target the dragon which means entering the lair. If they do this they will agro the dragon and it will be pulled to the entrance. Pet casters keep there pets with them and bring them in when they charge.<br>
-        Groups 3 and 4 go in when the dragon is at 90%. No sooner, no later. At this time, almost all the tanks in the first wave should still be standing. If you wait any longer, they will start dropping. You don’t want that to happen!! When this next wave enters, the tanks go to work. The two additional clerics and the 2 shamans can help out healing the tanks in groups 1 and 2 also. Tanks in groups 1 and 2, call out in shout if they need healing. Additionally, on Vox, the 2 chanters will go in with these two groups to mana sieve to prevent her from complete healing.<br>
-        Groups 5 and 6 (all casters) go in at 70%. Now I’ve heard lots of different times to send the casters in, from 80% to 50%, but 70% seems to work the best. Now just like the FGs and IGs, casters must be standing right under the dragon for their spells to get through. It is best if you stand to the rear of the dragon while casting also. This limits the amount of AE damage you receive while nuking. If a caster dies, they pop back up at their bind point, mem a nuke, pick up a coin or two, pull a pet if they can, and run back in.<br>
<br>
Now, that’s about it. If you follow these steps you should be successful, I’ve never failed yet using this strategy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now there is a few more things I would like to add before I go.<br>
<br>
LOOT –<br>
<br>
The best and the worst part of a dragon raid. Some people just come to participate in the killing of a supreme, beautiful, ultimately powerful being such a as dragon, others come with only one thing in there mind…..LOOT.<br>
<br>
Being the leader of a successful dragon raid, watching the beast fall is the most awesome feeling, but soon to follow is the hard ache of distributing the loot. Some people random everything, others merit things by how much dragon experience someone has and what equipment they need, others hook up there friends. You are the leader, you decide. It’s your raid you can do what you want with loot, but also remember this. If people don’t agree with how you handed the loot out, you will have a hard time getting people to come on another raid of yours, so your budding career as a raid leader may very well stop short. The best you can do is be fair. If you know someone is going to get a certain item before you start the raid, have the decency to put it out before hand. A simple explanation that if a pally book drops soandso gets it, or if this item drops this person gets it, will save you a whole lot of heart ache when it comes time to hand out loot. If people don’t like it, they don’t have to come.<br>
<br>
TO EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES THE LEADER –<br>
<br>
Remember a few things. It’s very hard to lead a raid. There are so many things going on at once. The last thing the leader wants to deal with is someone sending him a tell asking him questions. If you have a question, ask in OOC, more then likely it will be answered. Also, do not steal the leaders thunder. Don’t shout out commands, let him do it. He/she is in charge. Give them a chance to lead. And remember this, on average, a dragon drops about five items, there are 36 people on the raid, so do the math people, about 31 of you are going to go home with nothing. But at least you got to participate in the awesome event of slaying a dragon. And whatever you do, don’t complain about how loot is handed out. Suck it up, chalk it up as experience, and remember the person that did the handing out. Next time he/she asks you to go on a raid, politely decline. In all the time I have done dragon raids, I have never once seen someone change their mind about an item once it has been given out, so all your doing is wasting your breath complaining.<br>
<br>
That’s about all. I think I covered almost everything. Feel free to post if you have anything to add, or have a different strategy that works.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you all………<br>

<br>
Vox is easy  3+ chanters 50+ <br>
<br>
20-25tanks 50+ must have atleast 8 warriors 50+ - cus they take a beating better.<br>
<br>
3-6 nukers<br>
<br>
6 clerics perferable 52 for hero and such<br>
2-3 shaman <br>
<br>
Pet classes too.  Send in pets first. Send in rest Make sure you mana suck her.  1 ch isnt too bad 2 is doable but over 2 and your most likely screwed.<br>
<br>
Just have MR and CR atleast 100 min.  The higher you are the 52 the less your cr can be.  Get CR to 130+ and you shouldnt have a problem.<br>
<br>
People used to pull her out of her room but that doesnt work much anymore.<br>
<br>
Best thing to do is if you have a right clickable item or spell like yaulp cast it first and buff though that 4-5 crappy then good buffs.  Just keep yaulping when it gets dispelled and you dont lose many buffs.<br>
<br>
