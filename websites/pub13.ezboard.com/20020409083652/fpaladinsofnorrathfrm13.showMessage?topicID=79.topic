Looking for some wisdom from some of the bigger guilds/pallies out there.<br><br>My guild recently attempted Klandicar in WW - we were under pressure because we had another guild breathing down our necks so really only got 1 shot at him. We had about 40 players 55-60 (about half 59-60) - and our strategy was to use a main tank with a cheal rotation - spamming small heals while the rotation got started. The tank was a 60 ogre war with epics and we had another 60 war with epics as a backup (dorf). Plan was for him to build aggro for a min, melee rush, nuke at 70 or so (slow nuke) and offensive fullout nuke about 30-40%. <br><br>Well, it didn't go exactly as planned, either Kland is programmed to kill healers or our war didn't have proper gear to hold aggro. He started munching the druids etc almost right away. After he got through the small healers he started eating our clerics and pretty soon we were wiped out (we got him to 50%). <br><br>As I said, there was another guild breathing down our necks, and they quickly moved in after our wipeout and proceeded to take him down (after we rezzed our dead).<br><br>They had 55 ppl (almost all 58-60) and from what we observed just basically zerg rushed him (war groups first, then rest of melee - each group had cleric assigned to keep his group alive). They lost about 40% of their ppl but got the kill...<br><br>So what did we do wrong and what should we do in future? Was it just a matter of our warrior not having good enough weaps to keep aggro? Should we even use a cheal rotation and MT on this mob? Would it better to have a hybrid (paly or sk) be MT for aggro purposes? <br><br>Please enlighten me...

You *can* have a paladin or SK tank them for better aggro control. Sont is worse on healer aggro than Klandi though. The problem with that is that to have a paladin geared out to where he could tank them, you'd almost need to have been killing them a while. <br><br>Example: You're going to have to have a 3000hp unbuffed paladin to tank Sont or Kland. A guild that can gear out a paladin like that probably has killed Sont and Kland before. Honestly, even with the best laid plans, those two dragons essentially turn into shootouts like a 32k mob is by the end of the fight. Kland less so than Sont. <br><br>One other thing, I'd use small heals on Klandi for the MT because the fear will screw up a rotation, have paladins in as many groups as possible to heal off the AE damage with HWoP. We have a lot of pallies so that's an option for us.<br><br>Note for previous poster: <br><br>I've seen a paladin with fewer HP and less AC than yourself MT *Sont* and live to the point of enrage. Sont does a *hell* of a lot more damage than Klandi. (This was before slow was changed to be undispellable too.) Don't count out what you can do with a paladin MT. <p>Dagny Blazestorm <Arete>Crusader of E'ci</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udagnyblazestorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dagny Blazestorm</A> at: 3/25/02 2:00:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upankrat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pankrat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 2:27:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about Klandicar</span><hr size=1> Thanks both for the info - very helpful (although any other posters input is appreciated ;-) ). Octella in regards to my post, I think you read some stuff into it that wasn't there. <br><br>When I say they zerged Kland, wasn't meant from a deragatory point of view - zerg is a valid tactic - it was just from a description of what they did; IE they rushed the mob.<br><br>As to how we know how many ppl they had what tactics etc, I got this from a guild report as we left some observers behind to see what tactics they would use and hopefully learn from them. <br><br>Yes, bottom line is they killed the mob, and I don't  (nor did we) begrudge them that. I guess what you sensed was my frustration that our well thought out tactics didn't work and the fact that we didn't have a chance to try refining them. But that's the way it is - I realize that, especially on the older servers (fierce competition and lots of high level players and more high end guilds).<br><br>thanks again both for the input, and like I said any other input is greatly appreciated. <p>Knight of Tarew Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujeet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeet</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 2:55:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=79.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about Klandicar</span><hr size=1> Early CH's definitely get you munched on Kland (have had it happen to myself more than once while playing cleric).<br><br>One thing that has helped our positioning and agro control immensely is sending in a WS ranger first.<br><br>Ranger goes full on swinging with WS, War comes in shortly after and gets a freebie 10 sec or so period to build taunt.<br><br>You definitely want Kland slowed as well, makes it a very easy fight.

Its a similar fight where inevitably someone other than the MT will get aggro.. He doesnt have many HP's so hes manageable, but might take a few trys to figure out a strategy that works for your guild. We just pull and try to keep him on a single tank as long as possible, and if he gets feared just /assist heal and nuke/disc early.. he goes down like a ranger after you get the hang of it.

The key for us was to keep everyone healed. Not even rangers were expendable because we wanted to keep pouring on as much dmg as possible. <br><br>We also use a tactic we called "warrior waves". By that I mean we would have 2 or 3 waves of warriors we'd send in at once to hold aggro. Each wave consisted of 2 warriors and the healers basically just assisted Kland and healed his target. We usually have 3-4 paladins group healing the groups with the biggest dmg dealers (melee or nuker groups). All of the clerics also have group heal loaded and used them. <br><br>Now when the first warrior wave goes in we let them build up aggro for about 20 seconds before the rest go in. They go in with CE at first to give the healers time. Then once we get going good we have about 4 clerics that just try to CH those two warriors. The other healers do the /assist Kland thing. After the 20 seconds I mentioned we all go in and it does look like a zerg rush. There's no order to where we stand. Everyone is just all around him and once he's at about 50% it doesn't matter who has aggro, as long as it's a melee. I've held aggro for almost the entire last half of the fight before and it went fine. By that time he's not worried about killing clerics anymore.<br><br>Our Sont fights go a lot differently, but that's a story for another post.
