What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Some notes from a person who is still reading every post:<br>
<br>
To those who wonder why other classes worry about a druid petition, and those that feel that only druids know enough to respond, and those that feel that suggestions should only apply to druids (etc)...<br>
<br>
Imagine you had to choose from three people based upon what they say as an advisor for your community.<br>
<br>
Person Al says: &quot;I promise a chicken in my pot; a car in my garage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Person Bill says: &quot;I promise a chicken in every pot; a car in every garage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Person Cliff says: &quot;I promise that we will give more people chickens in their pot and more cars in their garages.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nobody will care about Al, he is clearly not thinking of anyone but himself. Nobody will believe Bill, he clearly doesn't have a clue. But Cliff will likely be listened to.<br>
<br>
On druids leaving the game - the past 6 months has seen a large group of people leaving for lots of reasons (DAoC) etc, etc. I am sure some have stated that the reason they left is because they were not having fun in the end game. This is also mentioned in the other classes too. An earlier post (sorry for not remembering who - but it was a great post) mentioned that we should examine our role in the end game and perhaps accept that it is different from our earlier role.<br>
<br>
Also, I know the moderators have their hands full with this topic. However, I have seen non-druids, druids, and moderators post what I would interpret as personal comments about the people instead of the arguements to the petition.<br>
<br>
Based upon the posts here, the one thing that druids want from this petition is more access to raids. They feel that the changes listed would help that. (Though I frankly doubt it.) As someone pointed out about 10 pages earlier, the end game is broken in one fundamental way - melee's stack, healers stack. Just about everyone else does not. This explains why we all focus on healing, since that one skill is something that might allow multiple druids to enter a raid and be desirable.<br>
<br>
However, the same limitation applies to all other priest classes. So along the lines of Cliff, why not propose something available to all priests, including druids. (I still like the idea of having a percentage heal 30% or 50% available to all priest classes as a rare drop level 60 spell.)<br>
<br>
And yes, increasing raid usefulness will increase your xp usefulness. Lets not be coy here and pretend that one does not relate to the other. It is much like Bill above, nobody believes it.<br>
<br>
By the way - I have seen some outstanding posts (on both sides). I have also noticed that Sobe is working overtime to read and record things. My complements. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uquiet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quiet</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/9/02 8:24:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukryts44.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kryts44</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 11:47:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=463>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/kryten.smeghead/kryts5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid Petition</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Comparatively, for 200 mana a Shaman can heal 1,200 hitpoints in 24 seconds (30 seconds when you add the six-second cast time for Torpor). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Topor is still a very rare spell and unatainable by your average level 60 shaman without paying ridiculous amounts for it.   If we're talking Raid only useage then Topor is not widely used for melle healing due to the side affects.   and seeing as its group only you would need a level 60 shaman in every group to make it effective.  Although at first glance the low mana cost makes it seem very powerfull, for raiding purposes its just another situational tool that can be added but in no way really makes us better healers.  Take topor away and we're all on chloroblast and for a shaman thats a very mana consuming way to heal on raids if your given a healing role.<br>
<br>
Totally agree with the single version of PoTG, seems very logical to me.<br>
<br>
Totally disagree with your request for dots, you where given greater nuking ability so I see little point in more dots.  lets look at the raid scenario here.  the same dots don't stack so if you have 10 shaman on a raid, only one can cast pox or bane of nife.  It would be the same for druids so not needed for raids really.  now look at your big nukes, 10 druids casting that against 10 shamans casting our biggest nuke<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Can't even remember what our nuke is called now its so useless in the hi end game.  the only thing upgrading dots for druids would do is increase their soloing power, you wouldn't need better healing ability then though.<br>
<br>
Luclin ports, who knows why they forgot to put them in there, perhaps they didn't have time and made it a feature to get the expansion out quicker<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   sure hope your successful on this one.<br>
<br>
Perhaps your class is unblanced, perhaps yous have too little healing power and too much offensive power now?  <br>
<br>
Good luck on your requests as although I dissagree with some of them anything that makes any class more usefull in the hi end raiding game is a bonus for everyone.<br>

Just recently a good friend of mine quit her druid for her monk because she wasnt having any fun with the character either on raids or xp'ing (having to solo alot cause not wanted in xp groups).   Most druids in my guild have talked about quitting their druids for a twink, something is highly wrong with that.   Also, about grouping, where are all the groups that want druids?  I see them shouting out for clerics or shamans all the time in places like sebilis/VL.  Can sit at zones shouting LFG for hours and not get one, or go solo for inefficient xp with few places to go at high levels (I know people getting 1-2 pts AA xp daily in a couple of hrs while quadkiting will take ya like 2 days to get 1 pt unless u spend all day doing it). <p>Fayne Dethe<BR>

Okay if druids are such a powerful class as you say they are, btw I have playing pen and paper RPGs for 20 yrs, then necros should be MORE powerful than druids.  Alas we're not.  In fact specialists in any field are more powerful than someone that's a generalist class.  Reason being is FOCUS.  At the cost of gaining that power is the being weaker in most other areas.  The cost of being generalized is that you can do many jobs well, but your not master of any of them.  That alone makes you very desirable, because if you lose a &lt;insert class here&gt; a druid can adequately fill in.  This makes you better than a specialist, because you CAN fill the role that is a specialization of another class.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzephreckshadowreaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zephreck Shadowreaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 11:59:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=466>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> After reading this whole ridiculously long thread again the main thing that I see over and over again is the phrase &quot;effective in the end game&quot;. Well lets look at that a second.<br>
<br>
The &quot;end game&quot; aspect of this game was not designed by verant to be done solo. Every class has unique strengths and weaknesses. When my guild does a raid there are certain classes that must be there on all raids. Yes that is true. But it is not those classes that makes the raids successful. What makes end game raids truly work is good teamwork, co-operation, and good strategy. No one class makes or breaks a raid. All are needed. <br>
<br>
Never in all my time playing the game did my guild ever say &quot;druids don't attend our raids today&quot;. And lets face it if you are working on high end mobs in the end game you are doing it in a guild. EVERY class could use upgrades in areas. If you are wondering why so many other classes see this as whining it is because the tone of the arguments is &quot;Druids need this....&quot; It is written from the perspective of we druids (as individuals) need these things to feel more important / be more effective. If you are going to be persuasive and move an audience you may want to invest some effort into your target audience. Other druids are NOT your target audience. What person playing a druid would every say &quot;No please don't give me better heals, etc.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Your target audience should be other classes. Thus their views whether you appreciate them or not are important. Until other classes besides yourselves see your weakness as being something that needs to be addressed I highly doubt Verant will see it.<br>
<br>
There is a perception that Druids are a very powerful class.  While you may not see that *Most* people do. And that is why on average the most popular class picked is a druid. While you argue that your high end abilities need retooling you fail to address the fact that it is easy to get to the end game playing a druid. Yes soloing isn't as fun as grouping but at least you have the ability to. It is an option.<br>
<br>
My played time as a ranger is 149 days played. And I am level 57. I helped a friend (soloing not being pleveled) play a druid to level 50. It had less than 20 days played into it. <br>
<br>
Why? Due to the ability of the druid to kite. They are amazing classes. If every class looked at their weaknesses and didn't realize their potential then no one would stick with one class. <br>
<br>
This forum was made open to other classes. Keep that in mind. If you want to move verant you have to first move the other classes to see your points. Thus far I don't see you doing that effectively. Instead if anything you are alienating yourselves.<br>
<br>
As far as not being needed in groups there are many that cry that same plea. Ask a mage how frustrating it is only to be needed for COH. Ask a ranger how frustrating it is to be able to dish out damage but have the same durability once meleeing as a caster. Ask a warrior how frustrating it is to have a healer in order to do anything. Each class has a frustrating aspect to it. The key is not to whine and gripe about what you don't have but to use your mind to decide how best to use what you do have.<br>
<br>
That is what other classes do and that is what will make you truly wanted in end game encounters. Not some sort of ability, spell, etc. The endgame was made for people that rationally think and have patience and perserverance. <br>
<br>
Pulling ability, Complete heal chains, aggro transferrance, those are all skills that players hone as they learn and play the game and what makes or breaks the game. Not one specific spell or ability. Ever see someone play a monk that has never pulled before? Having Feign death does no good if you dont' know how to use it. What about a cleric that has never been part of a CH chain? Timing is all screwed up and MT dies and then you have wipeout. <br>
<br>
Being level 60 isn't just a number representing your abilities. What matters most is your ability to play that character. If your petition is to address your inability to do better in the end game perhaps you should also think about what druids can do with what they have already. Because for most druids that play the game that will be much more effective use of time than a wish list that most others who are not druids will ever agree to.<br>

There is no way druids should be able to even come close to replacing clerics in a healing role.  Clerics have got to be the worse soloers around....my 56th cleric with average equip has great difficulty soloing light blue mobs...and then I would have to med a long time between them....many light blue mobs would hand me my head on a platter.  If druids can keep ppl alive on high end raids, where will that leave clerics??  Totally out in the cold.  Clerics HEAL.  True, we have many great buffs that are almost needed and often expected on High End Raids.  Thes buffs also tend to keep us poor....LOL.  But the one thing we can do like no other class and that is absolutely necessary is heal....if any class starts approaching clerics in healing power, I have no idea why one would want to play a cleric.  If u like grouping, play a cleric.  If u like soloing, play a druid.  But to play a druid and complain about not being desirable in groups is as ridiculous as some one playing a cleric and complaining that they can't solo.<br>

Rampage list is 4 people. Normally there are tanks filling the role so clerics don't get on the rampage list. You are not expected to heal rampage tanks (if you are, your guild needs better leadership). Ripostes should not happen...all melee should be behind the mob, with MT in front. If you wish to push mob the other direction, MT rotates sides and all melee are still behind the mob. Where are you getting riposted from? If your tanks are taking riposte damage, THEY are doing something wrong. If your casters are nuking and getting aggro, they are nuking too early, tell them to chill out. If a rogue misses evade, it's gonna be a couple seconds before that mob gets back on the tank..leading to 2 possible outcomes. 1) rogue dies. 2) mob turns back, rogue is not taking anymore damage, therefore the rate you heal him at is inconsequential. Don't tell me I don't know what i'm talking about when it's quite obvious that you don't.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Whether you understand it or not, the bottom line is people take damage on raids, whether they're maintank or not.  As of right now, clerics are primarily relied upon to do ALL healing, and druids function as a tertiary healer.  Druids would love to function as backup healers on these raids and in these situations...we currently are not effective in this right.<br>

Druids get damage shields, which are also insanely useful spells...however their usefulness decreases as levels progress. Slows start off as a relatively useless spell and progress to very powerful. It's a give and take. <br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You're right, the fact that my 4 point damage shield at level 5 was so grossly overpowered means that I should suffer at level 60.  You forget, damage shields haven't really been 'insanely useful' in a very long time.  <br>

Hmm, you want a 24 second heal over time, for 250 mana that heals 900 with no recast time. Torpor is a heal for 24 seconds for 200 mana that heals 1200, but also has a snare and slow component. You're right, they bear no resemblance at all. In fact, i can't believe i ever confused them with each other. /sarcasm off.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeah, far be it for druids to ask for something useful.  How dare we!<br>

There is no flaw in this logic. There is a pyramid of priest classes. It has Clerics on top..obviously superior. They get the best heal in the game, and then they get 2 other heals, which are superior to other priest heals. On the next ring of the pyramid is the 2 utility priest classes...Shaman, and Druids. Shaman got one of the cleric heals, druids got the other.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Yeah, and I never said Divine light was all that great either, ask clerics, they're not satisfied with it.  CE is fine because when you use ce, you expect it to take time.  Divine light is a pretty crappy heal, you can ask most any cleric.  I'm all in favor of an upgrade to DL, I think this is the druid petition tho, so it's off topic.<br>

Actually, necros that have their epic, love their epic. Manafree damage keeps the XP rolling. i also see many druids making use of their epic by root/rotting 4 mobs at a time, due to the manafree damage and snare their epic provides. Please, enlighten me...what mobs do you wish to engage, on an encounter where snare makes a goddamned difference, that you are not able to take? That Bulthar Herdleader giving you problems? Do you have issues with not being able to snare the Avatar of War and he runs and trains more giants on your raid? Again, i'm boggling here because you're failing to make valid points.<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok you COMPLETELY miss the point.  The point is not that we want to snare stuff we shouldn't, the point is we want our epic to land on mobs that are unsnarable.  How is this a hard concept? the mobs who are not snarable are immune to our epic.  We would like to still use this dot on these mobs.  Simple yes?<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Since it's damage is so meager, why would you wish to occupy one of the 15 buff slots mobs have with this POS dot? Am I missing something? Surely there are more efficient things to waste a buff slot of a mob on...especially in this day and age when people are getting &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; more and more often.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Exactly our point.  We want it to do significant amounts of damage, such that it is worth casting.  Thank you for proving my point.<br>

I've explained it so many times I can't understand how you could have missed it. You're not getting CH, period. Ever. Even group CH, so just forget about it. Then you want a better group heal and a better single target heal than the best cleric heals in each department. Raids revolve around CH, you are asking to be a better healer than a cleric in XP groups...and you keep denying it.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Oh, you're right, Druid_uber_divine_light_upgrade will make us better than clerics at healing in an exp group...yeah cause, CH is never used in exp groups...yeah that's it.  Common, you can't take yourself seriously....<br>

-------------------------------------------------------Need I remind you that your 60 heal drops off a vendor?<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeah, Again, we do not feel that Natures Touch is a viable heal.  It is the same (infact slightly less efficient) as chloroblast.  So yes, our insufficient heal drops off a vendor, where as torpor drops off of high level mobs.  So?<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------Actually, I am not incorrect, because it has happened. Natures touch is a faster heal than chlorblast in terms of total time to heal. You can heal 880 faster with natures touch than you can with chloroblast, therefore keeping up with mob damage on any mob that hits for more than ~220 or so. Trust me, I can drop Captain Bvellos or Yeldema with a druid healing with natures touch, but they can't keep up with chloroblast.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Heh, oooh Bvellos you say? whoa...<br>
Seriously, I'm talking about endgame stuff, or at least real mobs.  To get into numbers...<br>
<br>
Chloroblast <br>
385 hps<br>
175 mana<br>

<br>
NT<br>
880 hps<br>
400 mana<br>

Nature's touch is slightly faster, but the efficiency is the same unless you're talking about a manadump situation.<br>

You are not, quit thinking you are. You ARE NOT A MAIN HEALER ON A RAID. YOU ARE NOT A CLERIC. YOU ARE A DRUID. D-R-U-I-D. If you are not supposed to be healing the MT, and your raid should not be taking excess damage, explain to me why you need better healing powers on raids. You are asking for changes that will impact XP groups, it will have ZERO effect on a raid, because you will STILL not be a cleric.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeahp, I'll still be a druid.  I want it that way.  If I wanted to be a cleric, I'd make one.  Since I don't have one, guess what?  I don't want to be one.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------Heh, this couldn't be further from the truth. My best friend plays a 60 druid. He's in one of the uber guilds on the server. He functions very well on raids, in the role of SECONDARY healer and grouping with me on the xp grind, in the role of PRIMARY HEALER. I have no issues with druids at all, they are a fine class, and they are very balanced. When played by an intelligent player, they offer A LOT to the game. I am saying that the changes you requested are not needed, and they are very selfish in nature. Trust me, if shaman had a list like this, i'd be doing the same thing to them.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Guess what, I don't care what your friend does...have him come here, at least he knows what issues druids have.  Take a look at any &quot;uber&quot; guild...tell me how many druids they have.  Look at AL, druids are the only class listed as 'very low'...It is NOT because they have too many...it's because we bring so little to the table.<br>
<br>
Listen, the bottom line is this...this whole petition is not about druids wanting to be clerics, it isn't about us soloing better...We want to function as a backup healer, in ALL situations...  We want to bring something to the raid table.  I don't know about the rest of the druids here, I'd like to be able to outheal a paladin and a necro.  I personally think druids should heal better than shaman.  But even if not better than shaman, definately better than necro and paladin.  We currently do not.<br>
<br>
All the druids want is a reason to be needed.  There is just so much anti druid sentiment out there, that people hate the class without any logical reason as to why.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uegnarts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Egnarts</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 4:23:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=469>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us!

<br>
Some of this may have been said more articulately or politely by other posters (can't possibly read all this thread ... I will NEVER know why druids always get this kind of reaction).<br>
<br>
The post never said a thing about soloing.  It was and is all about what (or what little) druids do on raids.  Anyone in a strong guild knows 2 things.  First, clerics CH's rule the healing roost and always will.  No druid has a problem with that.  If I wanted to be a cleric I would have made one.<br>
<br>
Second, as much as the VAST majority of druids would rather be nuking, we are rarely given a choice.  The clerics in any guild will be focussed either on the MA/SA in CH rots, or on the main tanks in more traditional healing.  That leaves for almost any guild you mention a fair number of &quot;others&quot; who are allocated to druids, paladins and shamans.  We carry our weight, we play the challenge and we do what we can.  I can heal a group with melee in it on a Velious and earlier AoE mob - as long as the fight is short and I don't ahve too many doing melee.  I hate doing it, but I can.  <br>
<br>
I can also act as the main healer in an experience group, but really only do it well if there is a slower.  A shaman can replace a cleric all on their own in most experience situations.  Now for all of you who are squaking about the oppression of clerics, get over it.  No one in their right mind would choose a druid over a cleric for an exp group...it isn't even just about CH.  It is about Rez.  A druid just can't do that (and we dont' expect to).  It is laughable to suggest that druids are somehow competing with clerics for spots in exp groups.  What DOES happen is that in almost any experience zone you care to go to, you will zone in (lets say it is seb) and see about 10 assorted toons waiting and hoping for a cleric to show up.  The druid may get an invite for evac, but a wizard will be picked first cuz lets face it, they out damage us.  A cleric will be picked over a druid.  Not to say we can never get groups (we can) but to be blunt as a kick in the teeth, it is moronic to say we are stealing clerics work.  What we ARE doing with any increased healing ability is enabling the vast majority of players who sit and wait for that rare cleric to spawn to do experience rather than sitting on their butts at the seb zone in.  In terms of class balance, no class in the game should have the strangle hold on the ability of people to play the game that currently is in the hands of just a few classes.<br>
<br>
That said, if I am gonna be playing a cleric in an exp group I will usually opt to solo.  If I wanted to be a cleric, I would have made one (see above).  I can do it, I will do it, but it is not why I play a druid.  <br>
<br>
I do play a druid to nuke some and to have a variety of things I can do.  I accept that (other than fire and cold resists) I will not be the best at any of them.  But I want to be pretty damn good at something.  And again, before people get all worked up about ports....porting sux.  It is an annoyance and a burden for the porting classes every day they play the game...we get tells from complete strangers on the otehr side of the game world, get baraged by requests when we enter any zone, and are also asked by friends and guildmates at the same time.  If we were not willing to do this we would have stopped playing druids.  But don't wast any druids time harping on this benefit.  It is almost as much a curse as a freedom, and regardless, the PoP will change the way people can get around the world (and I am thrilled at the prospect).<br>
<br>
I do want to do more damage.  I don;t know if I need exactly the numbers and dmg per second posted in the original post, but yes I want a better dot than my best one.  Yes I would like my epic effect to be more useful outside of soloing (even in exp groups the mobs die to fast to make the long cast of the epic worthwhile).  Even changing it to a disease check from a magic check as someone suggested woudl be a help in making the snare aspect of our epic stand out from the longer and more reliable level 29 spell we have (I think ensnare is 29...anyway)...<br>
<br>
And most importantly, and at the heart of the original post, I want to be better at the job that I know I will be doing on any raid.  I WILL be playing a cleric...even a &quot;primary cleric&quot; for some group of people on any raid.  I can't do it well with the tools I have available.  We just can't heal the amount of dmg that raid encounters generate effectively, and I think it is reasonable to want to do so.<br>
<br>
For those of you who did come in to say &quot;god druids are so greedy,&quot; why don't you instead focus on addressing things that would balance your class out for the roles it ALREADY FILLS rather than criticizing people who intimately understand the demands of being a druid and have made a proposal to address them?<br>

If you wanna bring forth numbers of people actively playing any particular class, you're gonna have to ask verant.  Siting web based numbers is like putting a poll on the Chapters home page asking how many people visiting there have read a book in the past week, and then assuming that the results of that poll apply to the population at large.<br>

<br>
I have spent the last 2 days sifting through this pile of crap called a thread.  I have seen a TON of class envy, uninformed and unintelligent complaints, and whole helluva lot of WHAT ABOUT ME AND MY CLASS? posts.<br>
<br>
Some of you out there have stated that you are able to speak about this class and that class because you have played this class and that class to xx level.  Well, guess what, level doesn't mean jack-@#%$.  I don't care if you have 8 level 60 characters with 50 AAXP points in each.  If you got all those levels and AAXP grouping in Sebilis/Chardok/Fungus Grove, without ever doing any of the high-end raiding that those who have formulated this petition have done, then as far as I am concerned, your opinion is worthless and has no bearing on this petition.<br>
<br>
The problems pointed out here with the druid class were done by a handful of druids that have a WIDE range of experience in the HIGH-END game.  They regularly clear NToV, AoW, Statue, Vindi, Tunare, Cazic....they fight in Luclin taking out mobs like the THO, Rhag1, Rhag2, Shei Vinitras, Greig..etc.  These guys are damn smart, have a TON of knowledge and they know what they are talking about.  For anyone to even think that Sobe is a gimp, and has no knowledge of how the game works, is simply clueless. <br>
<br>
I have played a druid to 58, and then abandoned him, finding the class wanting in the end game.  I have played a warrior to 60, and still play him today.  I have played a cleric to 57 and I still play him today.  I have played a wizard to 52, and got so discouraged with the class that I stripped him and gave up, shortly after Velious' release.  I do not profess to know all there is to know about any of these classes, but I can say that I know a few of them, and their ins/outs, fairly well.  <br>
<br>
The druid class is broken.  PERIOD.  It needs some retuning for the end game.  How Verant will do that without severely overpowering the class outside of a raid environment is something for the designers to come up with.  <br>
<br>
I personally would love to see the snare effect removed from our epic.  It would hurt no one, and really make us no more powerful than druids already are.  Anything that a druid could solo with the epic prior to it being removed, they will still be able to solo.  If we couldn't solo it before a change to our epic, we still won't be able to, because normal snare still will not land.<br>
<br>
Heals are a very sensitive subject.  Any upgrde we recieve to our healing line will be looked at as an infringement on the turf of clerics, and any group heal we get will be looked as a nerf by paladins.  Whatever Verant decides to do, it will probably fall on the side of being too little, instead of too much.<br>
<br>
DoT upgrades.....<br>
I would not be adverse to a DoT upgrade.  Druids get no upgrade in this area for the last 7 levels, and are FAR behind the other DoT enabled classes for their best hi-end DoT.  I do believe that because our Swarm line has such a low resist rate, that any upgrade should be at best 85% of a shaman/necro best dot at 60.  This would keep us in line with the other classes, and still leave the necro and shaman entrenched at #1-#2.<br>
<br>
In closing, I wish that most of those that have posted here would bother to take a step back and really look at what they have written before they post it.  Most of the things I have seen here wouldn't even be fit for FlameVault, let alone the old Whineplay boards.  Be thoughtful, word your posts carefully, and be considerate.  <br>
<br>
Others will respect your words all the much more for it. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 58th Preserver</a></center>

<br>
There are simple factors here that need to be taken into account firstly.<br>
<br>
The Solo Ability of a Druid compared to a Cleric, basically a high level cleric has ZERO solo ability.<br>
<br>
Sure Druids have some issues in the High end raid game but with the introduction of AA point system more and more druids are finding groups quicker than Clerics.  Why simply because of the versitility you offer the group.  In the EXP grind groups many melee characters now specially high end warriors hardly take any damage so healing is not as important as other things like snare etc.  This leaves the cleric out in the wind looking for ways to be more versitile in the group environment and quite simply this does not happen.<br>
<br>
I do however agree that both the cleric and the druid need some better Direct Healing Spells the clerics best Direct Heal is at level 53 (Divine Light) and heals only around 900 HP maybe give a cleric a 1500 - 2000 HP heal at 56 or 57 and reduce Natures Touch to a level 56 spell and give Druids a similiar heal 1000 - 1500 at level 60 seems reasonable.<br>
<br>
What you however need to take into account is this by increasing the druids effectiveness in large raids you decrease the effectiveness of clerics in EXP groups.  The cleric community is already suffering greatly with the introduction of SoL and the AA Exp Tree making it very hard to find an exp grind group.  The only place the cleric really shines is in the Large Scale Raids.<br>
<br>
Secondly the AA abilities Assigned to the Priest Classes are really aimed at the Druid and the Shaman to make them more effective healers explain to me why a cleric needs to Critical Heal on a Complete Heal for 21000 HP? Yet for a druid casting Natures Touch a 3 - 4K HP heal is great.  What you all fail to see is the expanded tree you now have that you did not have before use your AA skills to obtain those so much more decided Healing abilities.<br>
<br>
This all comes down to one simple fact the Druid class is not designed to be a Great Healer, Great Buffer and Great Damage Dealer the druid is the Master of Casting Versitilty like the Bard is the Master of Melee Versitility.  You are able to fit into any situation to a certain degree and have many advantages that other priest classes do not.<br>
<br>
The cleric class got its' first upgrade if you could call it that when verant changed some of the DD line of spells for Clerics in over 2 Years of Everquest (Yes Basically Cleric's didn't receive any major class changes since Everquests Release) the Druid population has received countless and you should all thank your versitility and the ease and ability to play for the huge number of players that play your class.  This give you the huge influence to have things changed for the better for you class.  What you fail to see if that if you continue to push for Bigger and Better things you will basically become the BE ALL and END ALL Class why would anyone want to play any other class.  That being said you all should step down of the high horse and look at the bigger picture not the one eyed monster that you are all currently looking at. <p><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=http://members.optushome.com.au/arosewar/MYBANNER.JPG> <BR><IMG <IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-baker.gif alt=Baking_Skill:_100-174><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3a-blacksmith.gif alt=Blacksmithing_Skill:_100-174><IMG SRC=http://bronzedragonsite.homestead.com/files/academy/3b-lang.gif alt=Languages_Mastered:_2-11>

I would like to know what these Druids think about the fact that Clerics are the only priest class NOT to have a movement increase spell.  Everyone want SoW, or something similar.<br>
<br>
or the fact that we don't even get a pet that can fight for ANY amount of time, you at least get dire charm.<br>
<br>
or how about the fact that almost EVERY person that plays on everquest has a druid, or at least is going to make a druid.<br>
<br>
How about the fact the necros, and palys can now rez about 2 spell lvls higher than a cleric.  Not to mention that palys can also heal at about 2 spell lvls higher than a cleric as well.<br>
<br>
If you blur the lines even more, there will be an even SMALLER about of clerics than there already is.  <br>
<br>
So you can see why I am agenst this request, I mean if you want to be able to heal, and are worryed about the fact that there are less healers in some groups.  Then make a Cleric, if every one of you that wants MORE healing made a Cleric, there would be enough.<br>

<br>
Actually, most high end melee don't want to split their XP, they don't need to.  They just go solo in places like Seb, Velks, Fungi, etc.  That isn't our fault.  Clerics are still preferred for grouping over a druid.  Most melee, if they are going to duo with a healer, will prefer a shaman first, then a cleric.  <br>
<br>
The Druid has no play in this.  Blame Verant.  Stop using us as a scapegoat. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

The monk epic is the easiest epic in the game.  The final mob is a joke.  Granted, if there is even 2 clerics joining that mini-raid, you have zero use for a druid there, since we can't land a single spell on the mobs. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

<br>
<br>
The warrior epic analogy really doesn't work, the difference being the warrior makes the choice not to use the epic (for whatever reason, but he still makes the choice), while the game engine makes the choice for the druid.  The trend for a while now, with each expansion is to take more and more tools away from the druid and pass some others out to other classes.<br>
<br>
You can either buy or exp to get permanent sow.  Many mobs are unsarable, unrootable.  Druids ability to port has had additional roadblocks in every expansion.  Originally many mobs were tuned for lures, hurting both druids and mages.  Ultimately, that isn't the point of the petition, but just part of the druid experience.<br>
<br>
Noone would expect a warrior to tank a high level Luclin mob with Kurnark equipment.  Ultimately, that is what is being asked of druids in the role of secondary healers on raids.  <br>
<br>
Every mob is tuned with two damage numbers in mind.  Target specific damage over time (generally and hopefully for the raid the MT) and AE damage over time.  Combat is ultimately just a mathmatical equation.  What high level raiding druids (and guilds) are finding is that during time T (the time to kill a mob) given their mana pool M (including mana regen from all sources) they cannot keep up with the secondary damage over time with the current tools they have available. (Also a limiting factor is number of participants on a raid. . . too many cause too much lag for everyone and can lead to failure)  Verant obviously has the exact mathmatics for each mob and if the math on any of the suggestions proves to be off, they can adjust it.  <br>
<br>
Not all druids want to be healers, but since that is the role we are generally relegated to during raids, that is what the petition focused on.  New spells or role ideas would be great, but other than disagreeing with the solution, most dissenters offer no solutions.  (Nor were they around during the many weeks this petition was debated)  <br>
