is from the Memorial Service held 6/10 by the Blade of Enric - the story was based on the log of the event.)<br>
<br>
The gathering began solemnly, just outside the gates to Freeport. Greetings were exchanged, hands shaken, hugs given. It was the first time in a long while I had seen so many of the Blade together. We sat there some time as people arrived, each one kneeling before our trollish leader before taking their place with the rest of us. I sat next to Kelric as he absent-mindedly finished some arrows. <br>
<br>
This memorial had been a long time in coming. Our memories of them had not faded; the pain was no easier to bear. But to finally acknowledge them dead... it was hard. When it could not be put off any longer, Gruggoth motioned us into line. I fell into order, my head held high though my spirits could not have been lower. We moved, slowly. The procession filed along through the commonlands to the high plateau in the west. As I reached the top of the hill, I was surprised to see the number there. Many had come to pay their respects to our fallen friends. Gruggoth greeted them all.<br>
<br>
He walked to the edge of the plateau... overlooking the beautiful scene below, from which Gabrial and Ashai would look for the rest of time. His gaze stole over to the old grave of his father, and he sighed heavily. As Eoral knelt and began his prayers, I barely heard Gruggoth whisper. &quot;I miss you, me fadder. I miss you, me fren’s.&quot;<br>
<br>
The troll turned, and addressed us all. &quot;Tanks ta ya all fer comin'. Me brudders, me sisters, an' me fren's... We'z gaddered here ta be payin tribute to our fren's an' guildmates, Gabrial an' Ashai.&quot; Guidal looked down, wiping a bit of dust from his eyes as Gruggoth continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;Taken from uz --- from der familiez --- by meanz mos' foul an' senseless. Today, finally, we lay bot' a demz ta rest, here in dis place mos' special.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaldaria looked shaken and began to sob softly as Dawnya went to her side to comfort her. I heard a sniffling coming from the shadows behind us, but could not tell where it was coming from. Kelric looked as grim as I had ever seen him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forever will dey lie here, aside each udder, an' aside me own adoptive fadder, an' our namesake, th' Great Druid Enric. May ya allz be keepin' each udder in good company, forevermore, me fren'z.&quot; Gruggoth sighed and looked again to the newly dug graves. He turned solemnly towards Gabrial’s gravesite.<br>
<br>
We all lowered our heads, Dawnya wiping a tear away.<br>
<br>
&quot;A few wordz, an' I turn over th' floor ta any udders who wish ta speak o' Gabrial.&quot;<br>
<br>
I saw Kelric’s jaw begin to clench, and lowered my head to look at the ground. Guidal began to whisper a prayer to Tunare. <br>
<br>
Gruggoth cleared his throat and continued. &quot;Gabrial Redgrave, accomplished bard, original memmer o' th' Council o' Enric, ol' fren' o' mine... th' circumstances surroundin' yer end iz still cloudy ta uz all. Why ya setz out affer th' Redhand...&quot; He looked apologetically towards Morrigu and her group. Morrigu took another drink from her bottle of Kalish, lowering her head in shame at being duped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why ya setz out affer her az ya did wuz a mystery fer a seemin' eternity, but finally, we'z got our reasonin'. Not dat we likez it one bit.&quot; He drew a hesitant breath. Fer it wuz Anrion who set ya upon her... an' in turn, had her waitin der fer yaz, on dat fateful day in Freeport. Th' ensuin' horror had our two powerful organizations at each udders throats fer some time, tradin insults and blows... all fer naught. Fer 'twas th' doin o foul Anrion... th' False Son... dat wuz ta blame.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth turned slightly away from those gathered to face out across the plain, raising his voice to a defiant shout. &quot;Anrion... DOEZ YA HEAR ME, DOG?! YER PLAN FAILED, ANRION! An' where iz ya now, cowardly one?!&quot; Gruggoth turned back to face the crowd slowly, a bitter grin on his great maw. &quot;Hidin' in th' sewage wit' th' udder rats, no doubt.&quot; He chuckled and nodded. Dloc smiled softly. Gruggoth glanced back towards the graves, his expression again turning somber. &quot;Gabrial, me brave fren'... we shall miss yaz. May ya be findin' eternal peace.&quot; He lowered his head in prayer. I kneeled silently... a prayer on my own lips, and saw Eoral do the same. Guidal joined him.<br>
<br>
A warrior, Bulvae, came towards the gathering. He moved to one of our number and whispered, &quot;Vertao, what takes place this night? What is the gathering about?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A memorial, my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior’s eyes raised as he whispered &quot;OH! I am sorry, friends.... May his soul rest along with the Fathers of Halas... what was the fallen one's name, friend?&quot; This last he directed to Morrigu, who whispered &quot;Gabrial Redgrave, Bard of Veeshan&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Gabrial..... an honorable name..... may it live long in the memories of his loved ones....&quot; He lowered his face in humility.<br>
<br>
Crieth hushed the newcomer, focusing her eyes on the graves.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth, after a moment, turned back to the crowd and gestured. &quot;Would any o' yaz be havin words fer our fallen fren', Gabrial Redgrave?&quot;<br>
<br>
Morrigu looked at the lump of earth where Gabe now lied and swilled some more Kalish, trying to make the pain go away.<br>
<br>
Kelric stepped forwards and Gruggoth nodded at him. He took a deep breath and unclenched his fists. Looking about the crowd, he began to speak. &quot;I knew Gabrial only a short time. This gathering speaks to his character. Not long after...&quot; He paused, looking down at the box in his hands. After the tragedy, I found these.&quot; Kelric turned to Gabrial's grave and continued. &quot;That box holds lute strings. In that dark alley, ground into the dirt, I found broken strings, bloody and ruined... and yet, they still shone; they were still whole.&quot; Gruggoth looked away, his eyes cloudy and dull with the remembrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know not why Karana led me to these, but I place them here in memory of Gabrial.&quot; Kelric looked down, unable to go on. He hung his head. Gruggoth smiled sadly. &quot;Tanks, me fren Kelric.&quot;<br>
<br>
I heard Eoral’s voice to the right of me. &quot;So is his song now silenced, so is Norrath quiet, quiet waiting for Justice to come. Our song has been taken, and it shall not return. Weep Norrath's Children weep this day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guidal flinched, his lip bitten hard - bleeding slowly onto his tunic. Kelric looked at him as he stepped back among the assembled. Kelric pulled a cloth out and gently wiped the blood from Guidal’s chin.<br>
<br>
Craken spoke up. &quot;May I speak m'lord?&quot; Gruggoth nodded to him. &quot;Please me fren.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned to face the assembled. &quot;Tis a good site, all of yee. I never meet this Gabrial in person... but I still hear his songs. He lives within us...&quot; He choked slightly. &quot;Us all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaldaria laughed. &quot;Could I but play a lute!&quot;<br>
<br>
Craken smiled and continued. &quot;So I say, Lord Marr, bless Gabrial with your light, and honor. That is all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lorken turned his head, choking back tears. &quot;I...I'm sorry everyone... I can't watch this anymore...' He turned and fled from the plateau, soft sounds of sobs coming from below. <br>
<br>
Gruggoth spoke, looking behind us in the darkness. &quot;Morrigu.. I believe.. would like ta play sometin fer uz.&quot; She stepped out of the shadows, clad in simple leather patched clothes. &quot;Please, Redhand... if'n ya would.&quot; Kaldaria raised an eyebrow as the dark rogue stepped forwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye...&quot; she said. &quot;Many of you know me... well...this is the way Gabrial would remember me...&quot; She gestured to her attire. &quot;When last we hunted together, this was how I looked.&quot; Gruggoth looked on Morrigu, smiling at her words. <br>
<br>
&quot;I still remember those days vividly, and Gabe's songs. Before I do play, my Caretaker has something she wishes to do... Crieth?&quot; The warrior stepped forwards and bowed before the grave, addressing it. Though alas our paths crossed but rarely, I knew of thy name - heard in whispers around my home. And though our kind and thine are sundered by hatred, we share one thing in common. Honour.&quot; Gruggoth looked up at the word.<br>
<br>
Crieth nodded sagely to the gravesite. &quot;This gathering is testament to that fact. And I salute you, as a Warrior.&quot; She lowered her head and stepped back, Morrigu nodding her approval.<br>
<br>
Morrigu looked down at the instrument in her hands. &quot;This lute....was Gabe's...&quot; She choked back a tear. &quot;Many times, I listened to his songs. They fortified us in battle, they allowed us to run like the wind... His songs...&quot; She took a drink of Kalish. &quot;His songs were beauty incarnate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And now, I will play a song I learned from a young bard of Tunare, for Gabrial.&quot; She turned to the grave. &quot;One last song, old friend, and this time, please allow me .&quot; Rain began to fall softly around us as she lifted the lute. <br>
<br>
Touched by Morrigu’s words, Ferall squeezed Dloc’s hand. He smiled sadly at the rain as she looked up, letting it cool her face. Katrinity flicked a few locks of damp hair from her eyes.<br>
<br>
Morrigu began to play. &quot;Under Veeshan's starry sky, dig the grave where I'll softly lie... glad did I live and gladly died, and I played my songs with a will! This be the verse you grave for me, here he lies where he longed to be....home the singer, ever free, and the hunter home from the hill......&quot; She watched as tears fell on the wood of the old lute.<br>
<br>
Morrigu knelt down before Gabrial's grave. &quot;Thank you, old friend, for all your songs...&quot; She stepped back into the shadows to hide her tears.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth smiled. &quot;Dat... wuz beautiful, Morrigu. Many tanks. Would any udders gaddered here have any words fer Gabrial Redgrave?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kaldaria nodded, stepping forward. &quot;Dear friend, I knew you as long as any other in the Blade of Enric. How well you kept our guildhall, how strong the foundations that you laid. We can never replace you dear friend, only hope that we keep true to your memory.&quot; She ran back into the crowd, tears streaming down her face. Guidal and Dawnya went to her, comforting her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tanks, Kal...&quot; Gruggoth said. He sniffed a little, then turned to the graves, raising his voice so it boomed across the valley. &quot;Gabrial Redgrave.... REST IN PEACE, ME FREN'!!&quot; He saluted the skies above.<br>
<br>
Kaldaria whispered, &quot;Rest in peace my friend, for there are those of us who cannot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth sighed deeply, turning to the other grave. &quot;Ashai....&quot; He shook his head as though to clear it.<br>
<br>
Kaldaria bowed her head. &quot;Dear Ashai, dear Tunare, what purpose?&quot; <br>
<br>
Gruggoth continued. &quot;Ashai, young wizard o' great intent, yer life wuz taken from yaz hardly afore it were begun. Der wuz no shroud o' secrecy surrounding th' time o' yer demise. Ya wuz strucked down by Anrion az well.... but unlike Gabrial, ya wuz felled by th' fiend directly, az yer fren's wuz forced ta listen.&quot; He scowled angrily. <br>
<br>
I lowered my head, whispering quietly his name. &quot;Ashai...&quot; Kelric’s fists began to clench.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth’s voice boomed. &quot;Ware all! Th' dog Anrion picks hiz fightz wit' care, slaughterin' th' young memmerz o' Enric's fold, taken em out one by one like th' coward dat he iz. Even now, hiz chil'hood fren... nay, I stan' corrected. His BRUDDER... iz hiz captive an' even now iz forced ta commit unspeakeable actz. We prayz fer Miterev's safety. Every day. He WILL be returned ta uz. Ashai, ya will be avenged!&quot; Guidal bowed his head, his eyes clouding over again, this time in rage.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth turned to us. &quot;Ashai wuz among our youngest memmerz... doez anyone have words fer young Ashai?&quot;<br>
<br>
I stepped forwards. &quot;Aye, I do.&quot; I knelt down before the graves before turning to face the people there. &quot;Ashai was of my temple. Young he was, but pure of heart. He...&quot; I choked on the tears, and Gruggoth put a hand on my shoulder to comfort me. &quot;He was a friend to all, and gave me great joy in knowing him. He was struck down suddenly... brutally. He shall not be forgotten.&quot; I looked to the sky, raising my voice. &quot;My lady Quellious, keep him safe.&quot; I turned to lay a flower on the grave. Returning to my spot, I leaned against Guidal... my legs would not hold me. <br>
<br>
Gruggoth nodded. &quot;Tankee, Taerma...&quot; He smiled sadly at me. &quot;Any las' words fer Ashai?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kelric lowered his head. &quot;Only that we failed him. He was the youngest.&quot; Gruggoth looked to him, eyes sad. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, we did not... brave Tanolan e'en were chased off by... whatever... Anrion iz.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth turned to the graves. &quot;Gabrial, Ashai.... rest ferever here in dis place. Aside me fadder. Tiz a mos' beautiful place... am sure ya would approve.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hywelbane raised his voice. &quot;Age shall not weary them nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun we will remember them lest we forget.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth smiled and raised his hand above us. &quot;In Enric's Name!&quot; He kneeled down.<br>
<br>
&quot;In Enric’s name,&quot; Kelric whispered quietly.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth turned and said, &quot;Now, tiz a time fer celebratin'! Celebrate th' memory o' our fallen fren's!&quot; Bottles were raised, and many a toast drunk.<br>
<br>
Dloc walked over to Gruggoth. &quot;Sir Troll, I am honored to have been allowed to be here. Truly the Blade of Enric exemplifies honor and goodness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tankee, Dloc!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your friend's deaths will not be in vain, I assure you. And from every death comes a life, remember that. I pledge also, that any information concerning Anrion that the Balance receives, we shall pass onto the Blade.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Dat iz much appreciated, Dloc.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dloc continued, his face flushing. &quot;I umm... I have an announcement of sorts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth smiled. &quot;Aye! Please let uz know!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ferall grinned. Crieth poked her, knowingly.<br>
<br>
Dloc smiled. &quot;Ferall and I are engaged to be married.&quot; Kaldaria gasped in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Gruggoth cheered. &quot;Woohoo ! Congratz me fren's! A toast ta Dloc an' Ferall!&quot;<br>
<br>
All raised our glasses to toast the two, cheers ringing in the hills.<br>
<br>
Dloc blushed again, &quot;We have not set a date, but umm... it will be held in the sewers of Freeport.&quot; I grinned. &quot;’Tis where we ...fell in love I guess.&quot; He turned to kiss Ferall softly and she grabbed his hand, lacing her fingers with his.<br>
<br>
I saw Morrigu and Katrinity together, talking. Morrigu smiled at Katrinity. &quot;What did you think, Kat?&quot; Katrinity knelt before her. <br>
<br>
&quot;Twas an emotional ceremony.&quot; She nodded at Morrigu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye... that it was,&quot; Morrigu responded.<br>
<br>
Katrinity wandered over to the gravesites, looking them over. She knelt in front of them and thumbed a small seed into the ground. She rose, shaking her head, waving before she walked slowly away.<br>
<br>
People began to talk, some slowly walking back towards Freeport. I sighed and turned away from the assembly, wandering over to the edge of the plateau so I could look out over the lands. A little while later, I heard heavy footsteps behind me and a large green hand reached down to pat my shoulder. &quot;Youz ok purty lady?&quot;<br>
<br>
I sighed. &quot;I will be.&quot; I lowered my head. He looked as though he wished there was something he could do.<br>
<br>
Kelric and Dawnya came over to comfort me. &quot;It's all right,&quot; I said, looking up at them. I saw the concern in their eyes. &quot;It will be.&quot; I smiled. &quot;I will be.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gruggoth turned to the graves and ceremoniously dumped a little grog onto each of them, then poured the rest of it down his throat as the sun rose above us. <br>
