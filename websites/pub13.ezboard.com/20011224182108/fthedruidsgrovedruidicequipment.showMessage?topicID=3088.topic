<br>
  I am a baby druid (level 6) and have spent hours looking through all the old posts listed here on equipment suitable for a lil druid to wear. I am not going to repeat the same questions again, but I do have one that I have not seen answered here yet. I have about  4K Plat to spend and I want to get some of the usual things (Forrest loops, Silver Ruby veil etc) but I have no idea what I should pay for them in auction. I have seen the forest loops selling for 900PP and that seems high to me!  I know there are some web sites that list the cost of some items but they seem outdated or list a much lower price than what I am seeing on my server (Xev).<br>
  Of course, If you wanted to list a few items that you personally would recommend I buy along with the estimated cost I would be forever in your debt. I am currently wearing the usual Plain leather gear with a rusty scimitar and some brass earings.<br>
Thanks in advance for your time!<br>

There's something wrong with that.<br>
I'm assuming you are a &quot;true newbie&quot; rather than a high level player making a twink because you've identified yourself as a level 6 druid rather than saying you're twinking a druid, and also because if you had a high level character you'd have a better handle on the economy.<br>
<br>
Honestly my advice is: don't do it.  Don't twink yourself.  Surviving through those low levels, running out of mana, dying because of mobs beating on you, learning how to use guards, learning what to do when guards can no longer help you, learning to know when you're going to die and look where you are so you can get your corpse, learning to get your corpse without dying.  These things are a pain, but they are things you will need to know how to deal with later.  And you need a realistic picture of your abilities, which you simply won't get if you quintuple your AC and your mana pool with high end items. <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

   www.eqprices.com has very realistic data on the going prices for most items. Occasionaly they get spammed with lousy bids but it shows up easily. At your level, spread the money around avoing spending more than 100-200 for a single location. Admit the fact that you arn't going to have wis boots or Paws.<br>
   Personally I'd buy a few decent items you could keep into your 30's and let the rest come as it will. Get +6 wis rings, a silver ruby veil (posibly plat if you want to splurge) and maybe a chared guardian shield. Then go have fun! too many people with cash try to buy their way up in level with crushbone belts and greater light stone quests. By the time they can no longer buy there way up in level they are disappointed that their defense skill stinks and they cant keep buying armor to compinsate. Their buff spells fizzle 'cause they didn't group and end up recasting buffs a bajillion times. and no-one wants them in their groups because they havn't learned hate management or to stay put when being jumped so the fighters can pull it off of you.<br>
   Good Hunting.<br>

I will definitley check out eqprices.com. I got the plat from my BF who has been trying to get me to play EQ for a while. I certainly want to &quot;Earn &quot; my levels and not just be a &quot;twink&quot;.....I honestly  think the game is much more fun playing in groups anyways. I apprceiate the gear advice as well....I would rather get my higher level gear questing...but a little extra AC seems to go a long way ...keeps me fighting longer and searching for my corpse less! My druid buddies tell me I should save $$ up for spells....I will need it in the near future!<br>
Thanks again-<br>

(best bang for teh buck wise :))<br>
<br>
Charred Guardian Shield (CGS): Cost 400 plat, AWESOME stats for your level.<br>
People will say that Testament of V. will be better but it's nodrop so you can't buy it and need to be level 16 or 20 to do it .. so just buy the darned shield instead, besides it has good AC too ...<br>
<br>
As someone suggested, get 2 plat jasper rings, costs for jewlery is about double the price to make it .. if your server is old then lower these estimates. Cost to make one ring, around 120pp or so ...<br>
<br>
Foreman's tunic for chest slot. (100pp sounds right , or was it 200pp ???)<br>
<br>
Arms: prayer cloth tunare, 70pp ... part of teh screaming mace quest, so buy a bracer of battle and then turn it in to get the prayer cloth (+3wis, quest is in crushbone, look it up)<br>
<br>
legs: gator legs to aim for but they are 700pp, so I would save the money for somethign else ...<br>
<br>
hand slot: split paw gloves, 25pp, great item ...<br>
<br>
neck: Black iron medaillon, +3 wis, 25pp<br>
<br>
ear: electrum jasper earrings +3 wis (or was it gold ?), they are about 25pp a piece.<br>
<br>
head: savants cap, plus 3 wis, 30pp<br>
<br>
can't think of anything else right now, ... wrist you shoudl probably go for gold jade bracers, plus 15 HP and Mana (30pp a piece ?)<br>
<br>
Well, at low levels mana is better than wisdom, since you don't get that much mana per wisdom you have more, so pure mana items are better, but I would still go for the suggested outfit ...<br>
<br>
just my 2cp ...<br>
<br>
Elan<br>
<br>
PS: the stuff is great even if you are in your 30s ....<br>
PPS: eqprices is VERY accururate most of the time ... or sit in EC and do a Price check :) <br>
<br>

These were very useful to me up until around level 15.  Nothing like doubling/tripling your hit points, which allows you to stand in against mobs that usually kill an untwinked player.  I found these much more useful than an extra 30 or 40 mana from plat jasper rings on any of my low level twinks.  Just a suggestion anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uquelm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quelm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/11/01 10:14:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid Equipment and Prices</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm, if I had 4k to spend on a new druid, here's where my money would go:<br>

300 pp  Imbued Studded Boots: 6 AC, 2 wis<br>
1100 pp Velium Fire Wedding Rings: 6 AC, 65 hp (each)<br>
50 pp   Straw Spun Belt: 10 AC<br>
50 pp   Lumberjack's Cap: 10 AC<br>
100 pp  Symbols of Loyalty to Vox: 7 AC (each)<br>

200 pp  Lizardscale Mantle: 5 AC, 3 wis<br>
200 pp  Kunzar Cloak: 7 AC, 2 wis<br>
50 pp   Gold Jasper Earrings: 3 wis (each)<br>
25 pp   Splitpaw Hide Gloves: 4 AC, 2 wis<br>
25 pp   Black Iron Medallion: 3 wis<br>
200 pp  Hollowed Bone Bracer: 6 AC, 15 mana, 7 MR<br>
20 pp   Splitpaw Hide Mask: 3 AC, 5 MR<br>
700 pp  Gatorscale Leggings: 7 AC, 4 wis, 15 hp<br>
-- ~3.5k and most spots are covered --<br>
94 raw AC, +31 wisdom<br>
<br>
I'd try to pick up an Evil-Eye bag, and save the rest for spells, alcohol and a decent weapon.  Combine Scimitar?  Porcupining is a great tactic in the early levels, and the extra AC will help out in groups too.  I feel sorry for the mobs who have to face a level 6 druid equipped like this.<br>

<br>
your bf might be able to get you extra junk he would sell to a vendor but you can use.  an example might be a kunzar cloak.<br>
<br>
along the same lines, if he is around level 50, he can get you a treeweave and you can spend your money on items he would not camp for exp. <p><img src=http://web3.foxinternet.net/craigp/brotheraaroan.jpg>
