<br>
That is definatley your answer RTFM... much better written then my last one although we were basically saying the same thing.<br>
<br>
Druids (as a whole class) are definately thier own worst enemy. Especially in regard to class improvements and inclusion in exp groups. Sterotyping sucks but it is a fact of life.  The part of sterotyping nobody likes to talk about is that at least part of it is usually based on reality.  Many common druid stereotypes are definately based on past reality with the druid class.<br>
<br>
Thanks Salicia for pointing that out...  <p><table border="0">

I am trolling a bit here. Sorry ranger here not a druid but I have played one and have played the game since sept of 99 and have seen many of the changes. <br>
<br>
So allow me if you may to share my thoughts as an outsider (for the most part looking in).<br>
<br>
In the very begining one of the most powerful weapons a druid had was ability to not just sow but also snare and root.<br>
<br>
Which led to kiting. Before other classes could attempt it but were far behind druids. As more and more gained J-Boots and learned other strategies (I.E fear kiting) it seemed at least to me that general perception was that both Druids and at that time Necromancers were overpowerd.<br>
<br>
Now I know what you are thinking yes rangers have snare, sow, and root but lets remember they didn't get sow back then till 39 so in beginning wasn't really an option witout J-boots (which were rare back when I was a youngster) and also all hybrids had a now openly confirmed 40% exp penalty for both gaining AND losing exp when dying.<br>
<br>
So a great deal of hybrid hatred came from fact that <br>
<br>
1) By the time a ranger got the same spell as druids it was largely not as useful (same with other hybrids)<br>
<br>
2) Parent class didn't have exp penalty so at that time by the time you made a 50 ranger you could have one druid to 50 and another way past 40. (Again same with other hybrids leading to jealousy over their parent classes)<br>
<br>
Druids have always had very good DD with also having lets face it at least decent DOTs which are wonderful for soloing.<br>
<br>
This caused dissent from Wizards who had great DDs and AE spells but lacked a good utility DOT. (Keep in mind it is the Dot that allows casters to root / snare / med which made fighting so much easier)<br>
<br>
Necros could argue that you had almost as good as dots as them and better DDs but they of course had Pets (big bonus then) and of course lifetaps. From my experiences not many necros seemed to have problem with Druids in early days.<br>
<br>
Lets face it Enchanters and Clerics have always been a grouping class and most likely always will be. That doesn't mean that they can't solo just that they are always wanted for groups so why bother with soloing?<br>
<br>
Shamans are somewhat of an anomoly. For the most part when I started playing a shaman was one of those classes you never really seen solo much past twenty because of their amazing ability to bring so many buffs to a group. I still think that makes them very much desired even today. Also they did have the ability to solo but keep in mind Shamans lack one very very important spell that assists druids so much in kiting which is snare. Verants answer basically seemed to be the focus of the debuffs (slow mostly to help balance this) They also lacked the ability to do any ports.<br>
<br>
Becaues of their versatility and ability to do so many things at an early EQ age druids became a VERY popular class to play. Everyone and their brother/sister had at least one druid for ports, sows, etc. <br>
<br>
In those days they were bar none the best character to create if you wanted money. Time and time again characters of all classes that couldn't port paid one after another Druid for ports. While Wizards could do this as well due to the sheer numbers of Druids on at any time more  people began to look for druids for ports than wizards. Having to pay for ports had a negative effect on the Druid reputation as a whole. Most druids were seen not in groups but soloing, they charged you to port you, and later in the game as more and more gained levels reports of KSing became rampant. Sorry to say but on my server in the golden days if you took a poll on the ten most hated characters on the server at least 80% of them would be druid characters due to this.<br>
<br>
As time progressed alot has changed. But still today the druid is one of the easiest classes to level. There are many reasons for this. While it is apparent to me that the community of druids as a whole seem to wanted in groups they still do have the option of soloing. No one typically likes to solo. But not every class is as good as yours AT soloing which causes envy.<br>
<br>
Druids are not as gear dependant as other classes. Wait before you jump on this. Those that play the game now cringe even thinking of not having Wisdom of less than 200 but in the early days you didn't need to have that kind of gear to still be very effective.<br>
<br>
When looking at melee characters you see that they are very dependant upon gear which tends to give casters in general an advantage there. Druids normally were kiting so who cared what AC they had. All that mattered was the size of the mana pool and due to the sheer number of Druid items available their gear was typically cheaper to buy in beginning. Wisdom items in beginning of the game was much easier to gain than Int items in the early game. This was due mainly to the sheer numbers of druid characters that was made then as they progressed they sold their outdated gear. Wizards, enchanters, etc were far lower in numbers and less gear for each of those classes.<br>
<br>
Even today it is easier to gain items for a druid than any other class in the game. Though they do have the least amount of Aestetical looks in game and for fairness do lack mid level armor quests.<br>
<br>
Those perceptions that was started in the beginning of the game still exist today. Druid is still a popular choice as a character. They still are one of the best at soloing. They DO have a ton to bring to the table for every EPIC/ Dragon / Upper end mob in game. They may not have the abilities that they want... but they do bring alot to the table. For record typically on all our guild raids it is becoming a trend to put Druids with Rangers / Rogues in a group since both those types of melee classes are not trying to gain aggro anyway. Shamans are on buff duty and Clerics are worried about the main tanks so it becomse the Druids responsibility to heal those that are not main tanks. <br>
<br>
Believe me I understand the perception of &quot;I can do many things but am not good at any of them&quot;. In the old days of playing a ranger I could do many things but sucked at ALL of them all unless I was lucky enough to have good gear. Then I began to work on aggro management so that I could use my ability to dish out damage without being such a liabilty. And back then that meant alot of fighting for ten seconds / not fighting for ten/ fighting again as well as not using Damage shields to keep mobs off me. When one doesn't do any one thing great they work on strategy instead. I still say some of the greatest strategians in the game are rangers/ monks due to them learning how to split / separate / clean pull mobs.<br>
<br>
For this perception to change (the negative elitits perception of them more specifically) Druids have to in my opinion start seeking out how to change the perception of other classes. Which means gaining support from other healing classes that play the game.  Rangers were not fixed as a class until Clerics started complaining about them being mana sinks, and when Verant finally started seeing that they were the least played class (past a certain level) than any other class. Many may dissaggree with me on this but I still say the key to getting postive changes to your class are as follows:<br>
<br>
1) Persistence (Took rangers over two years to be where they are today which can still be seen as a 'broken&quot; class but much better and viable today&quot;<br>
<br>
2) Don't alienate yourselves. Don't seek out only the approval of other druids. Who doesn't want something better done to their class? Work with the Shamans, Clerics, and other healers about what would be fair increase to healing powers as that is by far your strongest argument for upgrade.<br>
<br>
3) Finally try to look at the big picture and narrow your petition. Focus on what you truly NEED as druids not what you want. Issues such as your epic and better damage output may not be as beneficial to the game overall as there would be to addition of group heals, better mana/ ratio heals etc for druids. By focusing on one thing you only have to defend the arguments against that one thing. When rangers made their huge petitions there was one thing that eventually they narrowed it down to which was needing better AC/hitpoints. Verant caved in and worked to some degree helping their AC but the hit point issue was never addressed. Learn from that and work at one thing at a time I would suggest.<br>
<br>
Just my observations and suggestions.<br>

<br>
No other class even comes close to druids pre-50... there is alot of power in the druid class from 1-50 and some of that continues all the way to 60, IMO.  It isnt until closer to 50 that several classes start to catch us and then pass us post-50.  Shaman are a good example of that...<br>
<br>
Do you want examples of how versatility is power?  Maybe that is what I left out...  I will think of some good ones, but the overall concept of being able to solo as well as we group is a big one. <p><table border="0">

Druids can cast most of thier buffs and spells all in one shot.  No pain to my fingers or hands.<br>

Big difference, IMO.<br>
<br>
There was a time not long ago though when bards did get beaked on because quite a few would charm kite hill giants around Rathe Mtns 3-4 at a time.  I suspect the lack of bards in the game compared to druids has a part in this also. <p><table border="0">

Some of those 'abilities' are very minor though.  The atack buff(fire fist) is self only for example.  The blind (sunbeam) I've never had a lot of sucess with.  The perma pet is a joke.  Oh, and druids wear leather armor, not chain.  I do agree that druids have a large variety of skills but in general practice, only a small subset of them are usefull, that being the fire dd's, Dots', heals, snare, root, sow and ports.  That's about 40% of the list. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

Our first snare was at level 1 - granted this was a heck of a resist check, but even then, we were the only ones who could stop that darn Orc Pawn from running away into the open arms of the guard KS'er.  By the time we got root at level 5, snare didn't get resisted half the time, and now we could stop them period.<br>
<br>
By level 57, our root has one of the best mana/dmg/time ratios of any of our spells.  We even get an AE form - both of which can last up to three minutes.  At level 35 our snare lasts 12 or minutes.  Other than buffs, no spell in the game lasted longer - much less one that was considered a detrimental spell.<br>
<br>
If you want to lock down our early-game overpowered nature, you'd need not look farther than our snare/root lines.  Snare is what allows us to kite, quad kite, etc.  Root is what allowed us to root-n-rot.  Now that snare stacks with root, you've got almost a 0% danger factor when doing r-n-r (self stupidity does not count as it affects everyone :P).<br>
<br>
Now lets put it into the big picture...<br>
<br>
We now can stop a mob from reaching us - or at the very least, make it very difficult.  Well a lot of other classes can do this as well right?  Lots of classes get forms of roots and snares.<br>
<br>
Druids, however, have the ability to do dmg to the mobs without endangering themselves too much.  We can DoT and walk away, we can use a right-click 10 second spell to quad kite, or we can use our own spells to do the same thing.  This ability knocks a lot of the melee classes out of the running.  They've got to be face to face with a mob - situations which usually prevent engaging multiple mobs.  This knocks out shamans and necros as well, as neither can quad kite (remember, shamans don't get snare, only root).<br>
<br>
So we can do damage - but that's not all (for only $19.95, plus S/H....).  Should we take a couple of hits on the head, we can heal ourselves.  This knocks the wizard right out of our class.<br>
<br>
Then, on top of it all, we get self mana regen later on.  One of the biggest reasons that more wizards don't solo is the fact that it usually takes them 30% longer to med to full (before their familiars came into play).  Not to mention the fact that if they get into trouble, they can't run and heal.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the only class that's been able to keep up with the druid's soloing ability is the necro.  The necro's had it's fair share of feeling useless though, so we can't say they've had it much better than druids.  However, if you put a druid in a situation where he/she can quad-kite, the sheer volume the druid can take out will negate the necro's ability to regen mana and hp. <p><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#CCCCCC">

Quite a few of them in my guild quaded like crazy to get to 60.  Don't forget that the spells they use to quad are quite a bit more efficient than the ones we use.  I have a good friend who is a wizard and he used to tease me about how he only used 1/3 to 1/2 a mana bar to quad when it would take me allmost my entire mana bar to quad. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

We're a watered down classs pre-50 because we are overpowered during those stages.  Then we get underpowered later.  Thats not balance, and that design only contributes to the mass amount of druids that exist as port whores and pwrlvling monkeys.  A lvl 35 Druid can contribute to a lvl 60 group for some of the main reasons why that 60 group might need a Druid.  And people want to know why they cant get groups?  Why everybody who plays other classes claim to know this and that about Druids because they have a lvl 30 alt?  Its the overbalance of us pre-50 vs us post-50 thats a huge problem.  Its just too easy and beneficial to create a low lvl druid alt to do the job of somebody that plays as a main.  <br>
<br>
We undoubtedly are a great pre-50 class, imo too good.  We ARE main healers pre-50(well, maybe more like &lt;45), good enough to compete with clerics as a main healer for most groups.  Our DS, SOW, and other aspects of our class are better lower in lvl, and contribute more.  We can out-exp any other class pre-50 soloing.  We are better at making money than any other class pre-50.  And while these aspects might strengthen the arguement that we are great pre-50 so we should suck post-50, i would hope people could think reasonably, and say classes should be as evenly balanced as possible from 1-60 all the way through.  Otherwise, you create the mess druids are in now, where there clearly are too many of them being used as alts to take away jobs from the mains.  <br>
<br>
Nerf us pre-50 and improve us post 50.  .  Imo, it does more good than bad for the reasons i mentioned.  Even though its probably abit too late to bring the population of druids more in line with other classes, at least it might to deter the influx of more druid alts.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr

i dont know how many times im going to ahve to say this, but ill say it one mor time.  THE DRUID QUAD KITING IS LESS 'SELFISH' THAN THE MONK SOLOER, OR THE SHAMAN ROOT DOTTING, OR THE NECRO FEAR KITING... BECAUSE THE DRUID QUAD KITING KILLS FAR FEWER MOBS PER HOUR THAN ANY OF THESE. <p>Azeroeth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucorlathist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>corlathist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/11/02 8:44:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27062.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hahahaha!</span><hr size=1> Just to jump in and duplicate some of what was said.<br>
<br>
I think we paid because we were &quot;everywhere&quot;  we could get to everywhere.  quick and easy.  Find a good spot, there was a druid.<br>
<br>
In terms of solo ability, I firmly rank us no higher than 5/6<br>
<br>
But its &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;work&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaman ((More work))<br>
Bard ((More Work))<br>
<br>
but of these you don't have &quot;downtime to BS&quot; if you want to outlevel the druid.<br>
<br>
Necros, Monks as well.<br>
<br>
Wizard is funny.  Pre-Familiars.  A wizard didnt have mana regen.  But they had more efficient spells so they used less.<br>
<br>
I'd but Wizards with Jboots/Run3 #5 and #6 without.<br>
<br>
The only thing we have over the 1-4 is the ability to change hunting grounds on a moments notice.  This is valuable.<br>
But in the long run, #1 to 4, can outxp a druid.<br>
<br>
Monk says &quot;Damn Bat 1 is taken&quot;.  <br>
Druid says &quot;Damn TD is crowded&quot; port to CS.<br>
<br>
Its the work part i have been focuses on a lot lately.<br>
<br>
Druid can Quad, Med.  and just chat.  &quot;seems easy&quot;<br>
Monk has to talk/bs while fighting that first bat, and then second, etc.  to stop to talk is to give up xp.<br>
