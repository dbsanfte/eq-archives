He turned to growl at a passing Lieth Val, the lesser of the species. Flexing his powerful muscles, the warrior caste Gnoll marched on his regular patrol route, padding quietly down the halls of Splitpaw, the newest addition to the Tesch Empire. He gripped his sword lightly, his head moved back and forth, scanning the halls for any sign of danger. His ears perked and twisted forward.  Ahead, towards the entrance to the vast dungeon, the faint cry of a Lieth could be heard. Gesturing to another Tesch, he moved quickly down the hallway towards the sound.<br>
<br>
“BLOOD AND GLORY FOR VALORBLADE!!!!”<br>
<br>
The Gnolls growled at the cry. As they neared the entrance room, the sound of blades crashing and the burst of magic grew louder. There was a final cry from a Lieth and then silence. The two Tesches looked at each other, moving to stand in formation to block the door. They gripped their weapons tightly and waited. <br>
<br>
Dantes grinned at Lanneth as the two paused, backs to a wall and waited. The ranger closed his eyes and smiled. His hands flashed before his leaders face. Two Gnolls around the corner, at the end of the hall. Dantes nodded and they both drew forth their bows.  The Valorblades spun around the corner and loosed their shafts. One Tesch yelped as two arrows struck home. The warriors vanished around the corner and, with a furious bark, the two gnolls gave pursuit. <br>
<br>
“Incoming!!” Shouted Dantes as he and Lanneth sprinted into the room and formed up alongside Omenn and Samildinatch. Behind the wall of armor and weapons, Olmotos stood patiently, robes rustling. His slender hands moved quickly and his tongue began to curl around the harsh syllables of a spell. Bakin grinned as he hefted his weapon and squared his shoulders.  His rough dwarven voice rang out in the caverns as the two Gnolls burst into the room.<br>
<br>
“Behold the power of Valorblade and run in fear!!!”<br>
<br>
In seconds, both Gnolls discovered that they should have listened to the dwarf.<br>
<br>
As the smoke cleared from the brief battle, Dantes looked about. “Is everyone unhurt?” Calm nods assured him that all was well. The commander grinned. “Let us move on then… Captain Shadowborn, if you would take the point please.”<br>
<br>
“A pleasure sir.” Lanneth grinned and padded quietly ahead, his bright half-elven eyes scanning the floors for tracks and Gnollsign.<br>
<br>
“Move out.” Dantes growled. <br>
<br>
The Emerald Warrior led the way, followed by Olmotos and Bakin, flanked by Samildinatch and Omenn. All eyes were alert, senses tuned. The small party had planned this raid for weeks. Rather than alert the entire stronghold with a full frontal attack, they planned to use stealth and wit to battle their way down deep into the stronghold and make a point to the arrogant Gnolls by killing one of their council… The infamous Tesch Val Kadvem. <br>
<br>
Lanneth grinned as he crept ahead of the main force. He moved from shadow to shadow, not as skilled as a thief but… he grinned, skilled enough for the task at hand. Peering around a corner, he spotted two gnolls guarding the double doors that led to their first objective. He waited and watched. One began to cast a spell, shielding his companion. The ranger grinned and quietly prepared his own counterspell. He released the magic around the shielded gnoll. His magic tore away the shield and the ranger sprang up and loosed an arrow at the caster before spinning on his heel and sprinting towards his comrades.<br>
<br>
“Incoming!!!” he cried. Ahead he heard the crash of steel as weapons were drawn and a tight formation formed. The ranger slipped alongside his commander and quickly spoke. “Two… caster and warrior..”<br>
<br>
Dantes nodded calmly. His eyes grew cold. “You know what to do.”<br>
<br>
The warrior sprinted around the corner and was met with whirling blades and harsh magics. Behind him he heard the Nisch Mal caster beginning a spell. The Tesch grinned. The Nisch would make quick work of them. <br>
<br>
“Sergeant Bitz!” Dantes growled. <br>
<br>
“On it sir!!” the dwarf yelled above the hissing of magic. “By Brell, ye shall not cast yer evils in my presence!!” Bakin raised his arms and directed his holy might at the Niche. With a roaring blast, the cleric’s magic struck the gnoll and knocked it from its feet, interrupting its spell.<br>
<br>
“Now!!”  Cried Dantes, and the four warriors leapt past the Tesch and surrounded the stunned caster. Blades flashed and rent flesh and bone. The Nisch Mal Gnoll gasped and collapsed to the ground.  The warriors whirled to face the Tesch. Lanneth shielded his eyes as the gnoll blew apart before him. As the smoke cleared, Olmotos calmly wiped bits of flesh from his robes. “You know,” the Tier’dal quietly whispered, “You shouldn’t leave your backs exposed like that.” Laughter filled the halls of Splitpaw for the first time in ages. <br>
<br>
<br>
“Okay.” Whispered Dantes… we have to kill the guards… there will be many. This will tax our skills to the fullest. Fail me not Valorblade. This is what we have trained for.” The warrior rose and saluted. Five fists returned his salute, crashing into breastplates and chests. Dantes took one last look over his warriors and strode off to lure the guards in to the ambush. <br>
<br>
Lanneth glanced around the room at his companions. Omenn smiled warmly, reassuring the younger ranger. Samildinatch growled, eager for the upcoming battle. His hands glowed with cold light, filled with power. Far off, Lanneth’s ears detected the sound of a twanging bowstring. He heard a faint cry… and another… and another… and another… and …<br>
<br>
“Oh hell…” the ranger whispered.<br>
<br>
Dantes burst into the room, eyes glazed, blood coming from a gash in his head. Lanneth moved aside to allow his commander to step beside him but instead cried out in pain! Dantes struck at the ranger again and again, The powerful warrior drove his blades deep into Lanneth’s flesh as the ranger struggled to parry. “Omenn and Bakin both filled Lanneth with healing magic. Lanneth began a spell, struggling to focus amidst the flurry of blows. As he released the dispel, freeing Dantes from the controlling magics of a Rosch Val Gnoll, the room was filled with barking and the roar of magic.<br>
<br>
“Form up!!” cried Lanneth! Dantes shook his head clear and joined ranks. The four warriors stood as a wal as a tide of Gnolls, the elite of the Splitpaw guards, crashed upon it like a wave on rock.  As the room rocked with magical power, Bakin calmly focused his divine power upon the warriors, healing them and lending them the strength of Brell. Olmotos watched the Valorblade fighters choose a target, he focused his mind and drew together his powers. Plaster cracked and a deafening boom shook the room as he released his power, smashing a Rosch Val from its feet to lie broken on the floor. <br>
<br>
Samildinatch growled as another blade bounced from his shield. The room was filled with gnolls. Far in the back of the room, the shadowknight spied a wizened old gnoll healing the warriors in the front. Crashing his shoulder into one Tesch Val, the warrior forced his way forward. Blows rang off his armor and Gnolls turned to attack his back. Dantes, Omenn and Lanneth flanked him quickly, drawing off the enemies, forming a wedge, Sam at the point. The dark knight grunted in pain as blows pierced his armor but drove forward, eyes fixed on the healer. He smashed a Tesch out of his way with his shield and launched himself forward at the healer.<br>
<br>
“DIE!!” he cried and stretched out his hand, his touch released the dreadful powers held inside a shadowknight… the result was terrible. The gnoll healer twisted in horrible pain, its back arched… and cracked. The creature’s eyes burst from their sockets. It twitched for a moment and lay still. <br>
<br>
Omenn grasped Sam’s ankle in one powerful hand and dragged him back to safety. The four warriors reformed ranks and stared out a the sea of Gnolls still left. The battle raged! Gnoll after gnoll fell before the Valorblade warriors. Olmotos rained death upon the creatures as they struggled to reach the calm caster behind the wall of armor and weapons. Suddenly, the wall broke.<br>
<br>
A massive Tesch Val gnoll forced his way between Lanneth and Dantes. A blow caught the ranger aside the head and the room spun. Olmotos cried out in pain and the warriors spun to protect him. In that moment, the Splitpaw guard howled in triumph as four burly guards closed in on their primary target… Sergeant Bakin Bitz. <br>
<br>
The dwarf stubbornly stood his ground, ignoring the slashing weapons and pounding fists to pour healing into the weakening Olmotos. His head spun as another blow struck him. “Farewell boys…” he growled. Lanneth shook his head clear. “NO!” he cried as he watched Bakin struggle. The ranger launched himself forward! His blades flashed and magic roared. He taunted and yelled. He kicked at one and struck at another. His magic flared, stinging and angering the gnolls. First one… then two, three and four turned upon the little ranger. Bakin’s magic flared and the dwarf sighed as his wounds closed. <br>
<br>
Lanneth could see nothing but Gnolls. Surrounded, he fought to stay alive long enough for help to arrive. Blow after blow rained upon him and he felt his knees grow weak. His vision blurred. <br>
<br>
Omenn threw aside a Tesch Gnoll and drove his massive sword through the chest of another. The paladin reached down and gently touched Lanneth on the brow. “Be healed, my brother in arms.” Omenn whispered and poured his own strength into the dying half-elf.  Lanneth rose to see the last of the Tesch Val gnolls fleeing. Swiftly he snared the beast and moved to block its exit. <br>
<br>
“Braaaaaak!! You cannot defeat the might of the Tesch Empire!!” The Tesch Val Kadvem burst into the room, sword in hand, as the last guard fell. The weary party closed ranks and met the gnoll’s furious assault with grim determination. “I have not the strength to heal!” cried Bakin as he meditated, searching for the divine power he needed to preserve his companions’ lives. Lanneth glanced at Olmotos, reading the fatigue and wear on the dark elf’s mind. He had taxed his magic to the limit. <br>
<br>
In that dark hour Dantes De’Durre roared in the half-light, deep within Splitpaw, “Blood and Glory for Valorblade!!!!” Lanneth grinned, Omenn spun his wicked two handed blade and Samildinatch growled coldly.  As one they squared off against the Kadvem. As one they whispered, cold and deadly… “die.”<br>
<br>
Blades whistled through the air and the Kadvem screamed. He spun towards Dantes only to be struck by Sam’s shield behind the head. Recovering, he whirled to face the shadowknight. Omenn struck out with his holy might, almost knocking the beast from its feet with his spell, stunning the gnoll again. As it faced the paladin, Lanneth released his own spell, thousands of insects whirled around the gnoll, biting and stinging. All the while, Dantes’ twin blades carved great gashes in the Kadvem’s flesh. <br>
<br>
Fear struck the beast and it turned to flee. Roots burst from the ground and grasped its legs. Darkness swept over the gnoll and it was blinded. Six blades ended its life as the four warriors struck in tandem. The Kadvem was no more. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ten minutes later, a roving patrol came upon the first sign of the carnage. The alarm was sounded and hundreds of gnolls poured from the barracks and flooded the hallways of Splitpaw but no intruders could be found. The council was assembled… and the absence of the Kadvem noted with anger… as one they stalked to the Tesch Val Kadvem’s chamber, pounding on the door, demanding to know why he was late. <br>
<br>
The door splintered as guards smashed it in… they howled and turned away from the room in disgust. The council members gasped as they peered into the room. <br>
<br>
There, deep within the stronghold of the most powerful gnoll tribe in history, fear reigned. The Kadvem had been nailed to the wall, a great ‘V’ carved in its chest. Written above the corpse, in its own blood, was a message scribed in fluent gnoll, courtesy of Olmotos.  <br>
<br>
“Valorblade was here.”<br>
