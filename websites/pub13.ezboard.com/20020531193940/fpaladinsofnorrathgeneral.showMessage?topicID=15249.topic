They could retool all encounters to reflect any changes they make just for that server.  Only new characters on the server, no transfers.  If people liked the new rules better they would vote with their feet.  As that server grew and other server shrunk in population they could split and merge the servers.<br><br>EQ has so many good things going for it, yet it is broken in so many ways and could use a major overhaul.  This might be a way to do it without people really being able to complain.  If you liked the old rules than play on an old server.<br>It might be interesting to have a casual server as well.  Maybe one with no high end encounters.  Make everything doable by 2 or 3 groups at most but remove all the &quot;uber&quot; items.

VI already has the ability and does do things to limit how quickly items come into the world: No drop, rare spawn, rare drops, long spawn times, difficulty of mobs.. etc etc.<br><br>The big, power guilds have always and will always continue to be the 'first' to take out uber_mob_01.  I don't think anybody has any issue with that.  The big, powerful guilds will always be the biggest and the best.  No problem there.<br><br>I do think that every guild, or group of players if its multi guild/non guilded people who come up with a raid force, should get to experiance all the content in EQ without having to 'race' to a mob just to get there 5 seconds before some other guild gets there first and yet again ganks a mob.<br><br>I'd like to see something implemented along the lines of having prerequisite mobs and some kind of account marking, or key or something else.. When a sufficient amount of players (be it a guild, or group of friends, or people from a couple different guilds) get together, and have met certain prerequisists, they can activate a portal and create a mirrored zone containing uber_mob_01.  Without the need to 'beat' another guild there.<br><br>With interguild competition story lines of quests really get screwed up, they can't flow like they are supposed to.  The quest givers don't say ok, go out, get me item A, item B, and item C but to do so, you have to compete with a bunch of guilds who will KS your butt everytime you try to go get item B.  I think that if VI could find a way to implement something along the lines that i'm suggesting for uber mobs and epic quests that alot more people would have alot more fun.  The encounter or the quest should be the challenge, not whether or not you can beat a guild there, not whether or not you can be the first to spawn the Sleeper so that everybody else has to spend 4 years in ST to get halfway equipped with primal.<br><br>Anybody have any thoughts on this?  <br><br> <p><html><p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"face="Edwardian Script ITC"><strong>Caebe Silverfish</strong></font><br><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"face="Baskerville Old Face">59th Season Knight of Mith Marr<br>House of Requiem<br>Tribunal Server</font></p></body></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uflintrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flintrok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/12/02 6:15:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15249.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Easy way for VI to change anything they want</span><hr size=1> I can understand the frustration of getting beat to a camp.  My current guild is pretty large (bout 175) and full of alot of skilled/powerful players with many folks that have there epic (or really close to it) but we are actually a pretty casual playing guild.  Most folks play only a couple of nights a week and only a few hours each.  We dont have the kinds of players that can form up 30 50+ folks at any given time to go raid something for 5 hours at the drop of a hat, it takes time and planning for us.  Our dragon/planes raids take a few weeks of notice so that folks can plan RL and make sure they can be there.  When we finally do get up the players there is nothing more frustrating than to get to kael and have it fully camped or get to naggy and find someone killed him yesterday (even if we scheduled it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) etc.  The uber guilds, or any guild that can get up alot of players at the drop of a hat at any time, do have a definite advantage. I will probably see all i can, and go to most everywhere but it will take me a whole lot longer to do it.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36384" target="flintrok">-=Current Profile=-</a><br><img src="http://66.197.149.109/SigPics/SigPicFlint.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uabazagaroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abazagaroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/12/02 6:45:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15249.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.modernhumanorigins.com/images/webring.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Easy way for VI to change anything they want</span><hr size=1> If you want to see and do everything as a casual player, grind to 60, have proper resists, know your class, have a good rep, and you can apply to one of the larger guilds on your server. Most won't have problems with someone that can't attend every raid or play 24/7, as long as the person realizes they won't be in line for the most valued items if you are in a raiding guild. Maybe you can't get into the #1 "uber" guild, but you should be able to get in one with a large number of level 60s and the capability to do higher end stuff. No one stops a casual player from seeing and doing things except the casual player themselves.<br><br>There is a rising disparity between the "upper class" and the "lower class" in everquest. And the problem isn't numbers, knowledge, equipment, or desire to do things, its that most "good" players gravitate towards 4-5 guilds on a server, and the other 50 guilds are left with a few dedicated people and a bunch of people unwilling to do what it takes to do anything (show up on time to raids, go to raids when they are online rather than exp grinding in a velks/seb group, get proper resists for encounters, etc).<br><br>What they should do is make an Everquest 2, set in Norrath 1000 years from the "present" time. They could use the same engine from Luclin, the same zones (altered of course, mob changes, item changes, location and geography changes), new storylines (maybe the BB gnolls get organized and wipe out qeynos, and gnolls are a playable race with a statue of Fippy in north Qeynos =P), etc. Spells and items could be balanced with what is known now. That would allow them to do relatively little work on the core of the game (its already done) and focus on creating a more balanced updated and interesting world, would allow them to implement whatever kind of inflation controls and anti-camping fixes they want without creating a furor because it isn't a "nerf". Sell it in a new box, making $40-$50 from hundreds of thousands of people again, charge $20 a month, get decent gm support and training, and give higher level players an incentive to move, like a one-time deal of having an account to EQ deleted, all characters gone, and having the highest level character's level equal an additional stat bonus that can be applied to one new character on the "updated" account. 60 stat points can't be unbalancing to any major degree, but if you can play the same game you've gotten hooked on, but with a completely "new" world to explore, and get an extra 60 points to start off with, would you do it? I think I would.<br><br>Hell, go all out and create a job system like they should have in the first place, make it so everyone starts out one of a few "base" classes, and to become another class you have to gain ally faction, do specific quests, etc., make you maintain your faction too or you degress and can't become that class again. Would prevent people from switching factions all the time if they wanted to make faction more important, would let people be able to switch classes if they want, etc. Add in some of those pvp server rules about class/races being allowed to group together, only one character per server, etc., and you got yourself a viable game that becomes a whole new ballgame.

Now we have a permanent &quot;QRA&quot; channel, which makes the allied guilds able to communicate as if they were one big guild (without losing your original guild associations or guildchat), and a &quot;QRA_officers&quot; chat channel, whereby the planners/organizers of QRA can keep in constant touch.  And then there's the &quot;QRA_raid&quot; channel, which is created any time we go raiding and have to be able to communicate among all the members of the raid.<br><br>This has worked out so well that QRA members often group together on an informal basis to do exp groups, camps, quest kills, and so on, even when we don't have a formal &quot;big&quot; raid scheduled -- once everyone gets to know each other from raiding together, it's like one big happy family.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugreydon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>greydon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ineffective.net/images/smilies/icon_04.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/12/02 6:36:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15249.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ineffective.net/images/templars/dt_member_greydon_01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Easy way for VI to change anything they want</span><hr size=1> [quote]How can someone that doesn't want to play more than 2 or 3 hours at a time ever going to fully experiance the high level zones/mobs in the game as it is currently set up.

Either that or they'd effectively be working on 2 different games.<br><br>I think that's the domain of EQ2. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udisavowedknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Disavowed Knight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/14/02 9:14:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15249.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Easy way for VI to change anything they want</span><hr size=1> is way for eq to change anything they want?<br><br>Do the programing required &lt;-- or atleast part of it and no worries about fully testing it.<br><br>Spend 3.2 seconds on any lame excuse for the change.  i.e. &quot;our vision is changeing as eq evolves&quot;  <br><br>put the change on test server for a week<br><br> make it go live.<br><br>Alternatively if it's a change the players may not notice right away they could<br> <br>Silently just put the change in<br><br>deny it when it is first brought to their attentions<br><br>almost appoligize for doing it and semi admit they did it and then ignore or pretend to listen to player base.<br><br><br>oh wait vi already works this way.  never mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=15249.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=15249.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15249.topic&index=12><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=15249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=15249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15249.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15249.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
