He had just entered his 49th season as a Warrior of the Empire, and had traveled to the Dreadlands of Kunark on an extermination raid. His brother Tzlar had also just entered his 53rd season as a War Wizard, and was supposed to join him on the raid. But, some political concerns called him back to his position as Chancellor, and he instead returned to Neriak. A pity, but when duty called, one must answer. It was Tzlar’s duty to preserve the Empire and destroy it’s enemies through the use of conspiracy, politics and intrigue. It was Zirrix’s duty to expand and defend the Empire through force of arms. Different tools, but the same result, as well it should be. Zirrix knew little of politics, and he was glad of it. Out here, in the far places of Norrath, slaughtering the enemies of the Respected Race is where he truly belonged, where all Warriors truly belonged. He had recently obtained, with the assistance of Magil, a Knight of Innoruuk within his guild, a perfectly crafted Guardian sword. It was a magical weapon, imbibed with properties which both enhanced the wielders natural physical abilities, and bolstered their defenses against certain attack forms. In addition, the weapon itself was incredibly sharp and could be used with great speed and precision. The blade itself at times seemed almost ethereal, as if it was a vapor frozen in time. But, it’s razor edge and perfect balance was testament to it’s lethality. In his other hand, he still held the whip won from the minions of the God of Fear Cazic Thule, taken from that deities home place. It had taken Zirrix some time to get used to certain “characteristics” of the whip. <br>
<br>
It had been one of the face tendrils from an Amygdalan Warrior, an inhabitant and guard in the Plane of Fear. Since the denizens of the other Planes were infused with the power of their realms, they existed by a different set of physical laws. As such the whip, having been a part of the Amygdalan Warrior itself, was still quite “alive” in the realm of Norrath. It writhed and wiggled and was quite animated, even while hanging on Zirrix’s belt. Using it took some getting used to, as it would often squirm and dart when employed, as if it was fighting a separate battle of it’s own. Zirrix discovered, that by concentration on the whip itself, he could influence the things movements and behavior. As time went on, and he used the whip more and more, it became easier and easier to control. Now it was a devastation weapon that complimented his fighting styles admirably. Besides, the vision of a Teir’dal Warrior closing upon it’s prey, battle fury in his eyes, living whip in his hand, was often enough to dishearten Zirrix’s opponents. But, there were those too animal in intelligence or unbalanced of mind, who were not influenced by appearance. Such as the beasts Zirrix hunted now…the Drachnids.<br>
<br>
The half Teir’dal, half spider monstrosities which called the Dreadlands their home were singled out by Zirrix for a special campaign of extermination. All but the High Elves of Felwithe were less hated and despised by Zirrix. The Drachnids, both for their alliance to the Traitor Mistmoore located in far off Faydwer, and as a perversion of the Respected Race, had won the honor of being the first “non-intelligent” race Zirrix had decided to completely exterminated. Drachinds were cunning, skilled and extremely dangerous, but they were too mentally abhorrent to possess true sentient intelligence. The Humans had a word for his campaigns against the Drachnid menace…Genocide. The Teir’dal had word for it too…Vengeance. What unforgivable crime had the Drachnids committed that doomed them to such vengeance? It was their very existence itself, their infected creation demanded that they be removed from Norrath completely and with no exception. There was no tactic too brutal, no attack to merciless, which would not be permitted, even encouraged, against the Drachnid. Perhaps it was some genetic connection, between a true Teir’dal and those wretched mockeries, that called to Zirrix’s spirit for release from the torment of their lives. Perhaps it was just the duty of a soldier to protect his people from contamination. Whatever the other reasons, they were enemies of the Children of Neriak, and thus must be eliminated. That was all the reason needed or required to seal their fate. As another target crested a nearby hill, Zirrix gripped his sword and glanced down at his living whip. Closing upon his prey, sword gleaming in the setting sun, whip snapping out in anticipation, the Second Born of House T’Rhennic continued in his just and noble crusade of genocide against the enemies of the Empire and the Respected Race! <br>
