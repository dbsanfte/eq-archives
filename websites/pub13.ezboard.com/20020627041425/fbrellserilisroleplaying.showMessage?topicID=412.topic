<br>
        The sounds of metal clashing metal rang through the hall, reverberated off the walls.  The screech and grunts of the crowd mixed in with the sounds of combat to create a symphony of violence.  The blood covered Orc, axe in hand, lifted it high, causing the cheering to redouble in sound, the dead Gnoll at his feet.  The Orc stooped, grabbed the Gnolls head by the ear, and hoisted it high, a stream of blood dripping from the strands and shattered bone of the neck.  He threw his head back, tasting the blood of his victim, then dropped it on the ground, the meaty thump sounding in the new silence.  The Orc kneeled, and said to the figure on the throne, “I serve none but D’Jarvok, he is my master.  This death I give to him, and my soul is his forever.”  The Orc then stood, hefted his axe, and walked back to the side of the courtyard.  D’Jarvok’s eyes lifted from the body on the floor, staring across the crowd.  “Bring forth the next combatants, a new fight shall begin!!”, and the cheer was heard by the golems outside the fortress.  <br>
<br>
        “You waste our soldiers like they were nothing but toys.  You are a drunk with your first victory D’Jarvok”, Jonathan said this while walking into the basement with him.  The Dark Elf whirled on him, his eyes flashing, “You forget yourself Jonathan.  Remember that it is indeed my victory.  For every death in the courtyard, we bring in ten recruits that slip through the blockades outside the gates.”  “It is a silly waste of the soldiers.  We should be preparing for our march on Rivervale.  They will not fall so easily as the Highpass Soldiers, the Druids and Clerics will make it a difficult battle.  If we do not do something soon, the Freeport humans will join the others, and then we truly won’t be able to escape from this cursed Fort.”  With that, Jonathan turned and swept up the stairs, seeming to float out of sight.  D’Jarvok stood silent for a moment, then spit on the ground, and continued to the basement.  He was beginning to tire of Jonathan, he had become more rebellious since Asmodeus and his soldiers had been slaughtered.  D’Jarvok thought it was time to get rid of him, perhaps he had been wrong to create the creature in the first place.  Even he did not realize the power contained in the book, he had no need of supernatural creatures who would not obey their masters.  Passing through a doorway in the deepest recesses of the basement, D’Jarvok smiled to himself.  Jonathan did not know of the passages the Goblins had been making in the deeps of Highpass, he doubted anyone but he and them did.  Pressing aside the rock door, he stepped into the circular passage, and dissapeared into the darkness.<br>
<br>
        The winds around Freeport smelled of salt water and cooking fires.  Malak stared out through the window at the gathered forces, wishing he were down there with them.  Instead, he was in this stuffy room on the top floor of the Milita building, listening to the plans of men bent on destroying them all.  At least, that’s what they seemed to want, from the way they planned to go about this.  The Captain of the Militia seemed determined that a frontal assault on the fort of Highpass was the only way.  The Sorcerers wanted to try and use magic to dig a tunnel through the cliff face and bypass the walls and gates.  The Rogues seemed to think that a midnight assassination of D’Jarvok would solve all of their problems, and yet another solution came from the Clerics and Paladins, who thought that constant prayer might bring about intervention from one or more of the Gods of Norrath.  The Monks stressed continued negotiation, for they could not coneive of a being as powerful as D’Jarvok who would not listen to reason.  Malak thought it ironic that the guilds and groups not represented here, the Shadowknights and Necromancers, had taken the most direct action, setting off more than a week ago to join up with D’Jarvok.  The only good news was that Rivervale and Queynos had organized and sealed off the Fort, so that further troops could not get into the Fort, but that could not last.  Eventually open warfare would ensue, and damn it, Malak was stuck here with the @#%$ beauracrats.  He felt so useless, it sickened him.  He glanced over at his friends, sitting away from the main table, each with looks of disgust on their faces.  Cervantes was drawing figures in the dirt on the floor with his staff, Geryon simply staring off into space, probably thinking about Asmodeus.  Malak once again cast his eyes to the window, looking off into the distance.  He thought, if he looked hard enough, that he might see D’Jarvok staring back at him, and felt sure he would see the Dark Elf smiling.<br>
<br>
- Chapter 8 -<br>
<br>
        “ENOUGH!!!”  The word echoed off of the walls in the courtyard, causing those closest to him to wince and cover their ears.  The Orcs and Gnolls, Undead and Dark Elves, Goblins and Wolves, all looked in the direction of Jonathan, standing a few feet from the stairs that led into the catacombs.  The wind was gusting around the tops of the trees, sending whispers to the winds, and the silence of the moment seemed to drag on forever.  Eyes flashed with evil, mouths hung open, fangs dripped blood.  The two undead in the center of the ring, seperated by a few feet, never took their eyes off of each other, swords covered in gore, flesh hanging from them in strips.  Jonathan strode forward, through the ranks of creatures surrounding the courtyard, towards the center.  Stopping a few feet short of the undead, he spoke in barely a whisper, “Drop your swords.”  The sound of metal clattering off of cobblestones rang through the afternoon air, and the undead turned to face him.  “There shall be no more useless blood shed.  We should be out killing our enemies for victory, not each other for sport.  There are forces gathering outside the gates of this Fort, forces bent on keeping us bottled in.  Who among you would rather kill your fellow creature, instead of our enemies?”  The silence was just as absolute as before, perhaps more so, for the wind had stopped, and the sounds of rustling armor and weapons had ceased.  “Who among you will follow me into battle against the Halfling bastards?”  The cheers this time were unified, but the bloodlust had not changed.  <br>
<br>
        Dobbin had joined the Guardians of the Vale only a month ago.  His father had been a Guardian, as had his father before that.  His brother had opted to join the Deputies, but there was no shame in that.  Defense of the streets was just as honorable as defense of the city as a whole.  It had seemed an easy decision, Rivervale was a peaceful community, and had been for more years than anymore could remember, even the old timers who spent their time at the pubs of the city common.  Even the Goblins had not attacked them in over ten years, and even then it had been a mere raiding party, the rest of the clan having dubbed them insane for attacking us.  So, it had come as a surprise to everyone when the call to mobolize the army had come, and an even larger surprise when they had been dispatched to seal off the Kithicor exit of Highpass.  There were rumors of an even larger force of Queynos soldiers who had sealed off the Karana’s exit, but Dobbin doubted it.  He had become convinced, along with most of his fellow soldiers, that this was just a training exercise of some kind.  Something to rattle their cages, keep them on their toes in a peaceful time in history.  So, he went along willingly enough, even after hearing they would be staying in Kithicor for some time, despite the undead that had infested the forest for some years now.  Having seen no sign of them though, even that fear dissipated after a few days.  <br>
<br>
        Guard duty seemed to be the most exciting thing the troops could hope for, at least as far as Dobbin could see.  It was either that or sit around a fire and tell stories, and the stories got old fast as the days wore on.  So it was, on the third day after they had arrived, Dobbin found himself at the picket line, staring over the wooden barrier they had built, spiked staves jutting from the ground in front of it.  Dobbin thought of his home back in Rivervale, rabbit stew cooking over the fire in the hearth, his family seated around the table, talking of good times.  He did not hear the twang of the bow, nor did he hear the thud of the arrow that tore open the throat of his fellow Halfling, 20 yards down the wall.  He thought of his brother, dressed in his Deputy uniform, joining him for a drink in the bar, where they were saluted for their service to Rivervale, and he missed the second thud as an arrow pinned another Halfling to the dirt, 15 yards away this time.  He thought of his father, dressing in his Guardian armor, taking his place among the others, on their way to battle the Goblins ten years before, and missed the arrows that thunked into Gorrin, his good friend, 10 yards away.  Baaryan heard them however, and was rewarded with an arrow in the side of his head, as he turned to face the noise.  Dobbin continued staring at the Highpass gate, unaware of his coming death.  The last thought that flashed through his head, before the arrow struck him in the eye, was that he might have left the fire burning in his tent. <br>
<br>
        The Dark Elf archers picked off the Halflings at the wall from the cliff faces easily, their eyes piercing the night like lit torches.  The Undead, also living only for the night, slinked through the cracks in the wall, Jonathan at their lead, and materialized on the other side, seeming to grow from the shadows.  They hid themselves in the dark where the Halflings had stood, staring at the empty gates of Highpass.  The Orcs and Gnolls were massed a few yards around the first turn in the canyon, waiting only for the signal to burst out and jump the walls.  The Dark Elves slinked their way down the canyon walls, passing through the defences almost as easily as the Undead had, taking their positions in the darkness.  Jonathan stood up, walked out into the clear moonlight, staring at the campfires not 50 yards in front of him.  He marveled at how a city as large and old as Rivervale had not fallen sooner, when their army was this ill trained.  He looked upward at the stars, the moon shining palely between the trees.  He raised his arms, and could almost hear the arrows being fitted to bow strings behind him.  He sucked in a great gasp of breath, his eyes and mouth seeping a faint purple light, and let loose a roar that shook the trees, extinguished camp fires, knocked over tents.  The Halflings camped closest to Jonathan were bowled over by the force of the yell, the pots, burning logs and packs of supplies near them lifted and thrown off into the night.  Those that jumped to their feet dropped down again with arrows in their chests, those that stayed on the ground were set upon by the undead.  The Orcs and Gnolls behind them knocked the wall apart, splitting it apart and charging through, screaming in half a dozen different languages.  Halflings were pouring from the darkness now, leaping over half burning fires and tents, swords and axes glinting in the moonlight, their armor flashing and dancing in the firelight.  The two forces met in the center, the clash of combat ringing noise anew off of the trees.  The Dark Elves danced in and out of striking distance, tearing flesh and bone with their daggers and rapiers.  The Undead threw themselves over the Halflings heads, landing in the center of the main Halfling onslought, tearing their enemies in half, tearing bites from their legs and arms before throwing the pieces to the ground.  The Gnolls and Orcs swung their clubs and maces, swords and axes, cleaving off limbs and heads as they streamed through the camp.  The Halflings were outnumbered, facing stronger opponents, but worst of all, they were un trained and scared, many peeling off and fleeing into the night, pursued by the Shadow Wolves until daybreak.  Jonathan strode through the carnage, with no fear of blade or arrow, the fighting seeming to part before him in a bubble of calm.  His eyes glinted purple, and wherever he gazed, his troops redoubled their efforts, the Halflings dying by the hundreds.<br>
<br>
- Chapter 9 -<br>
<br>
        Malak was staring out his window again, this time from his room above the Seafarer’s Roost.  He found himself unable to sleep, even after the amounts of ale he had drank before retiring.  Nothing had been decided at the meeting of Guilds today, and Malak doubted it ever would.  Geryon and Cervantes told him at the end of the meeting that they would head out and find D’Jarvok themselves soon, and Malak had agreed to go with them, for better or for worse.  Malak thought that he could get help from Kaladim, but it could take weeks for them to get here, and D’Jarvok would be knocking on the doors of the Temple of Brell by then.  <br>
<br>
        Malak thought these thoughts deep into the night, the moon slowly dropping towards pure night.  The salt air of the ocean drifted through the open windows, cooling the heat of the fireplace near his bed.  His eyes just began to close when Geryon crashed through the door, his eyes wild.  He began to babble, his words streaming together into one long noise.  Malak tried to calm him, but Geryon simply grabbed him and dragged him out the door and down the stairs.  They burst out of the Roost and into a crowd of people, all of them running towards the Gates.  Malak and Geryon sprinted ahead, out-running most of the soldiers and civilians, Malak screaming for someone to tell him what was going on.  Past the Militia house, out into the open air of the night, and Malak could see the crowd of people, but not what they were surrounding.  Rushing forward, he hit the wall of bodies, pushing and shoving his way through them, until he saw Cervantes kneeling over the robed and bloody figure of Asmodeus.  His hand still trailed the streamers of blood from the night when they had last seen him, but his face was much more pale and gaunt.  He looked towards Malak, his eyes pleeding, his mouth drawn into a white line.  Malak strolled forward, dropping to his knees beside his friend, his hands already flashing blue.  They light lit their faces, Cervantes joining Malak with his own healing magics.  As Malak laid his hands down upon his chest, Asmodeus’s hand appeared to bleed all the more, his robe becoming a brighter shade of scarlet.  Then, just as quickly, the wound closed, leaving new hand and fingers, the skin fishbelly white.  Asmodeus’s eyes closed, his neck relaxed, his head fell back onto the ground.  Malak thought perhaps they were too late, but then he saw the color in his friends cheeks, the pallor of death replaced by the pink of health.  “Take him to a bed, keep him warm, get him something to eat.  He will be weak for several days, but he will survive.”  The soldiers closest to Malak moved to obey, but Geryon already had his friend in his arms, carrying him through the parting crowd.  Malak thought he saw a glint of purple light, the spine of a book in his robes, and then he was gone.  <br>
<br>
        Asmodeus was sleeping downstairs, having eaten some warm stew and Ale.  Malak found himself wondering about that glimpse back at the gates, had Asmodeus risked his life all over again to retrieve the book from D’Jarvok?  Surely even Asmodeus would not have the strength for that.  As he layed down on his bed, the embers of his fire finally dying, he wondered what would become of them, for the final time that day.<br>
