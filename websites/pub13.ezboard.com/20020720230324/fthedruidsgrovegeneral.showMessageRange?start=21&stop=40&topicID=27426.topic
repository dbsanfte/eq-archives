Caster balancing will force them to re-adjust everything anyways.  Since the intent is to make casters more powerful in some way, Verant will have to tweak the difficulty of the mobs regardless unless the caster changes are so minute that it wont make a difference.  What percentage based abilities do is keeps Verant from having to re-adjust everything in the future.  For example, we know PoP will bring many new abilities, and tougher mobs.  Hypothetically, lets say our current DS's were tuned to a percentage of luclin mobs.  The DPS of a damage shield remains pretty consistent in that scenario, and would never really become 'outdated' in the manner our current damage shield has.  This thread already shows our DS isnt what it once was depending on how high end of a game your playing.  <br>
<br>
Even Quillistar's point in how it really isnt so 'unbalancing' compared to the damage output of some tanks reinforces that it should be percentage based.  Currently, its an outdated spell that becomes less effective the higher you lvl, and i'm not exactly sure that it was intended to be taht way.  Then again, the amount of hp's some mobs have, or their damage output probably werent in the original vision either.<br>

<br>
That is because CH did not break the game (e.g. the game works and CH is in it).  However, if you take away CH, most boss mob encounters become impossible as is, or atleast you have to replace each previously CHing Cleric with 5 Clerics (DL), 6 Druids(NT) or 11 Shamen (CB).  The game is not, therefor, broken by CH, but the entire game IS built on CH.  IMO, it would be a better game without it (alternatively, it would be a margiially better game if CH simply were not monopolized by one class).<br>
<br>
&quot;I think its a crucial ability that makes sense for Clerics, and only Clerics to have.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is arbitratry.  You will be incapable of supporting that arguement without resorting to one of two things: 1. That is the way the game has been, 2. Some mushy RP style rationale (e.g &quot;The Vision&quot;).  CH is an ability in the game.  There is no rational reason it has to be the exclusive domain of Clerics, it simply is.<br>
<br>
&quot;It has a major aggro factor, and encounters arent trivial because of CH, with the way mobs are attuned to its aggro and some boss mobs damage output.&quot;<br>
<br>
No.  It doesn't.  Quite the opposite is true, I suspect.  There are fights in the game where CHs are required to land (not be cast) within the first 1-2 seconds of a fight (AoW).  The result is not agro immediately shifting to the Cleric.  I suspect, if only to make such fights possible, that CH has a drastically reduced agro effect, at least as to certain mobs, compared to healing the same amount by other spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;With or without CH, the mobs would be tuned to similar states of difficulty in some other manner.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, I would hope so.  That is kind of the point.  It would be nice if the game were balanced, fun, and very challanging, without reliance on a single spell avilable only to a single class. <p>____________<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13463"

<br>
See, i disagree here.  I know people have stated Clerics can solo, and do this and that, but honestly, clerics cant do nearly as much as other classes because their focus is healing, and thats basically their sole responsibility in groups.  They have one all-powerful group ability that makes them needed-wanted, people arent picking clerics up for much else than their ability to heal.  The fact taht they have CH makes them the unquestioned healers of the game.  I see no reason why a druid or shaman should get CH at all.  Even the whole 'fantasy' idea of a cleric has to do with healing, what sense would it make if druids or shamans were just as good or even almost?  Clerics cant whine because they have the most powerful ability in the game even if they think its boring, or forces them to rely on one thing.  Druids and Shamans cant whine about CH, because Clerics are very limited in their other abilities.  It somewhat balances out in the end, better than many other scenario's.<br>
<br>
From what i understand then, the issue seems to be people are just sick of the CH routine.  Which doesnt mean CH is broke, as Aemdaar stated.  But to be honest being sick of something isnt a valid reason to change something that would take almost a total overhaul to change.  Imo, the CH-MT routine works even though its the principal idea behind every encounter, and people might be sick of death of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadowsend.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadowsend</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/28/02 1:12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27426.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> As a player that 2-boxes a paladin and druid quite, often I've seen the diminishing returns of a damage shield with each expansion. In fact the continued decline in effectiveness of damage shields prompted me to complete the 8th Coldain ring quest, extra 8 pts add up.<br>
<br>
One option is a damage shield that is a percentage, 10% as an example, of the recipients total HPs. This would typically give a damage shield between 50 to 70 HPs on a raid-buffed tank. It would also scale, to a degree, with the level of the recipient.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, a stackable damage shield would be interesting. Allow multiple druids to cast a specific stacking spell until a damage limit is reached. The base damage of the spell would have to slightly lower then expected but allow for more then four or five casts to stack.<br>
<br>
Just a few thoughts for the day. <br>

<br>
Not a "good idea."  A necessary change if DS are to have relevance in a game in which Slow and CH exist.<br>
<br>
And it's not so much that CH has broken the game, it's that the game has evolved past the point where CH wasn't disproportionate.  Think way, way back before any expansions when we all maxxed at 50.   <br>
<br>
So, the real question is how to make DS relevant in a world where mobs have close to a million HPs and hit for 500-1000 per hit.   And how not to have that DS adversely affect the lower and mid level games.<br>
<br>
Proportional DS is the answer.  At lower levels, a good spike job can do more damage to the mob than the damage it does, so a proportional DS would be much worse than any of the existing spikes.   A proportional DS really becomes effective only against the higher level mobs that hit for 140+ damage per hit.   Make it a single target DS with the same duration as our top blades, but at twice the mana cost.<br>

Sure.  To the extent that no druids and one shaman are required on a raid and 6 or more clerics are required, I suppose it is balanced.  Though, frankly, I'd suggest you re-tar your scale. <p>____________<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13463"

<br>
I don't think one spell diminishing the other's effectiveness was VI's original intent with these two lines of spells. Rather, I believe VI intended for shamans and druids to each possess own ways to mitigate damage -- to compensate for having secondary healing ability. <br>
<br>
This type of mitigation can be seen across the spectrum. <br>
<br>
Take secondary defensive classes, for example. Paladins have less raw ability to tank than a warrior has, but they are able to cast stuns which help to mitigate the overall amount of damage taken. Shadowknights have less raw ability to taunt, but they can use lifetap and debuff spells to keep or regain a mob's attention.<br>
<br>
The problem is, VI has based the high-end game too much upon a very few specialist abilities; maybe because it was easier and quicker to use lowest common denominators, or perhaps they didn't anticipate how scientific players can be when it comes to developing strategies (&quot;show me some numbers or shut the $%@&amp; up&quot;), nor how rarely its players will stray from a proven stratagem. <br>
<br>
It isn't VI's fault that players crunch numbers and determine the most efficient methods to take down each type of mob, but IMO, it was VI's responsibility to know their player base well enough to realize that people suspend any sense of abstract roleplay when it comes to phat lewt. And therefore it was VI's responsibility to take all classes into consideration when developing high-end encounters.<br>
<br>
While I think it should have come at a much later level than 39, CH itself doesn't break the game. On the contrary, ever since CH was introduced into the game, it has been one of those LCDs (lowest common denominators) VI has used when developing nearly all of its new higher level content. To remove CH from the game at this point would break many encounters; and frankly, even if they wanted to, I doubt they could go back and redesign all that content. So, realistically, removing CH is impossible.<br>
<br>
Because it is futile (i.e. waste of effort) to ask for the impossible, those who play classes which were left out of VI's equation need to help VI see the need to add class abilities that can be significant to those LCD encounters. <br>
<br>
My suggestion for new types of DS is an example of this; I explained how the concept of DS had become broken over time, and proposed how it could be fixed, relative to a similar mitigating ability (shaman slow) that scales up/down with mobs. <br>
<br>
I could think of a dozen DS types that would provide druids with a new effectiveness in raiding without overbalancing existing encounters, but it's probably best to stop at the initial idea and let VI take it from there. Give them a direction without making them feel they're being dictated any specifics.<br>

I have always viewed CH has the horse and the cart as the difficulty of high end encounters.<br>
<br>
A percentage based DS would probably require Sony to raise the bar on high end encounters similar to how CH raised the bar.  As long as everyone realizes this and accepts it as a very possible consquence, so be it.  I definately think this is the lesser evil of all the options I have seen so far.  Not a great idea, but probably the best of the ones to choose from.<br>
<br>
/devil's advocate on<br>
<br>
It is fair to assume Sony would give mages the same DS spells, just fire based... therefore would mages just take over this abilitiy in raids since thier dmg shields are already superior to druids?<br>
<br>
/devil's advocate off<br>
<br>
One positive (depending on your perspective) would be that it would be easier to load up a good DS on your twink and not have the shield steal the kill... :)<br>

<br>
Point taken, if you're looking at damage mitigation in its most literal meaning. However, there is more than one type of damage mitigation in this game, and if there wasn't, there would be no advantage at all in bringing most classes onto raids.<br>
<br>
In that broader sense of the word, Enchanters mitigate damage by removing a mob from play until the party is ready to focus its attention on that mob. Wizards mitigate damage with nukes; the more quickly a mob is defeated, the less overall damage it does to your party. <br>
<br>
Case in point: any significant amount of damage, regardless of its source (nuke, DoT, DS), is a mitigating factor in the amount of damage a mob can do to your party. <br>

<br>
If the intent was to provide druids and shaman with ways to avoid melee damage in order to compensate for lesser healing, it is obvious shaman got the far supeior end of the stick.  Aside from its obvious superior mana/dmg ratio, druid (and mage for that matter) damage shields become less and less useful as one gets closer to 60 simply due to the high number of HP's you find on those mobs.  Sure, you still enjoy a great ratio, but the contribution the DS makes to the battle is often times not noticable and definately not ground breaking... slow on the other hand seems to become more and more effective as shaman level.<br>
<br>
I am not sure why this just popped into my head.. maybe I read it in some thread, maybe not.  How about adding a small resist component to damage shields and then making them percentage based.  Either a normal initial resistance check at the first hit that effected all subsequent hits or a very minor resistance check for each hit with partial or no damage being the result of a successful resistance check.  That could serve to easily balance the power of percentage based dmg shields. <p><table border="0">

How about a stackable DS for 32k+ encounters?

  Do I think CH broke the game?  I think it unbalanced the game.  It made virtually EVERY high end encounter end up requiring the same boring BS.  Sure, they tried to add some flavor to the Luclin encounters by introducing curses; but so far they have had little impact.<br>
<br>
  If they had never given CH to Clerics, they would've gotten something to compensate.  Yes, they are the top tier among healers, and they deserve some distinction; but not SO much that it makes a raid force sit on their @#%$ waiting on more clerics to log on.  If people would prefer the game to continue this way, that is their deal.  I on the other hand, would like to see some actual skill involved where REAL strategy must be used to bring down a MoB; not just changing the CH cycle by a couple seconds to compensate for how hard a MoB hits.   <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=171494</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urumand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rumand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/28/02 6:06:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27426.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DS or Slow: Which is better?</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm.... an interesting idea.

<br>
I suspect the only reason dmg shields dont make resist checks now is the possiblity for those checks to put unreasonable load on the servers.  It has nothing to do with class balance.  At any given time there are many druids and mages casting dmg shields on the tanks across a server and if there was a resist check for each hit, that could potentially bog down a CPU but would definately add alot of overhead to the proccessor.  If the mob got only one resist on the first hit then it would defeat the purpose... players would just cancel the DS and recast until one stuck.  Tedious, but not really that much of a power balance.<br>
<br>
Either way, I dont think it is reasonable to expect an increase in DS effectiveness without some kind of resist check or other balance to the damage... maybe using aggro or something.  <p><table border="0">

Bullshit.  I'm sick of these half assed attempts to 'improve' Druids while keeping balance.<br>
<br>
Druids have been out of balance for a good long time.  I could give two shits.<br>
<br>
Unresistable 10% DS.  Mob hits for 600, it takes 60 points of damage every time it hits.  Mob hits for 1100? It takes 110. Mob hits the tank for 50, it takes 5.  Plenty of balance there, imo.  Make it stack with Bard bracer, ranger ac/ds buffs, hell make it stack with mage DS so they don't bitch. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/28/02 8:14:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27426.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Scirocco says:  <b><i>A damage shield that reflected a substantial percentage of the damage inflicted (20-25%, perhaps), or a percentage of the mob's hitpoints, would make a DS actually useful in the top-end game.</b></i><br>
<br>
Before you automatically jump the "top-end game", where balancing damage shields would be <i>most</i> difficult, think about how they would do it for just the 50+ XP game.<br>
<br>
Proportional damage is a good suggestion but I see two problems:  (1) I don't think the game coding can handle such spell mechanics and (2) even if it could, to what would you set the percentage?  If it's to be based on pre-Kunark, it should be around 40-50%, which could cause severe game imbalances.  Or should pre-Kunark be nerfed as part of this percentage process?<br>
<br>
In raids, the problems only get worse.  Given the massive amount of melee damage of some of these NPCs, one druid casting one simple spell could end up doing the offensive damage of several other classes combined.  At the same time, a single damage shield spell wouldn't make druids more desirable because (a) mages have would it too and (b) only one member of the class would be required to make it work.<br>
<br>
I think an easy-to-code solution which would help out the higher level game would be a 50% upgrade to the level 58 spell, to give it a value of 48 per hit.  Also, the anti-twink solution should be improved to prevent this spell being cast on anyone below, say, level 52. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/29/02 12:49:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27426.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I think an easy-to-code solution which would help out the higher level game would be a 50% upgrade to the level 58 spell, to give it a value of 48 per hit.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I would prefer a 10% of damage done dam shield.  If its a bit harder to code...I don't care.  That's why we pay Verant.<br>
<br>
10% dam shield is balanced by the very fact that any raid does whatever it can to reduce the melee output of the mob they fight.  Atk debuffs, str debuffs, slows, dancing widdershins on the full moon before the fight....<br>
<br>
On most fights the MT goes defensive, making the damage dished out significantly less. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27426.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27426.topic&start=41&stop=47>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=27426.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=27426.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27426.topic&index=40><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=27426.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=27426.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27426.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27426.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
