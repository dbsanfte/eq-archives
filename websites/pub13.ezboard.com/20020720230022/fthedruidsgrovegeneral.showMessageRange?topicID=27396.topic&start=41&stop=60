If I had some of those things I might could say that the chart was real, but he could be useing our lvl 1 heal. Maybe he is putting Regen up to a 1 shot heal. Sure regen is a better over time but it really don't matter if the mob is out damageing it. <br>
<br>
Oh and when you think of Bards damage they do lets take a bard put him in a group of warriors. Ok keep followin me here. Add up their Dps. Then have the bard play Just Haste. Now find the new Dps (bet it went up a little). Would you call this the bards Dps I would. <br>
<br>
How about have the Wizzy nuke and find his Dps. Now have the bard playing mana regen the whole time he burns his mana again nukeing. Did he get another nuke in. I think that needs to be added too.<br>
<br>
Bards were never ment to solo they are enhacers. Putting them up to another class solo they suck. Showing what they do with a full group is how they are powerful.<br>
<br>
Yes bards need work. Yes bards are broken. No bards are not some weak class that everybody picks on. Yes that was mostly a wish list. <br>

I also notice no jump when the bards get the ae heal song. Leaving out the fact that bard songs jump from healing 6 to healing 40 is huge. It would be like trying to compare mana efficiency of a direct nuke to a point blank ae nuke with only one target. But anyone who has ae'd fear or some other spot can tell you that it does make a difference how many targets there are.<br>
<br>
At level 58, a bard can heal 40 people for 2 a second, so that is 80hp per second. The best druid heal is 176 per second not counting med time. Add the bard epic effect in and they are really close to healing as much as a druid straight up without med time. At the same time that same song is regening enough mana to chain to chain cast two complete heals (spread out of course) before the epic effect is figured in. On top of that they can melee at 60% of what a warrior can do and throw in two more songs.<br>
<br>
Bards have issues I agree, but that chart just doesn't come close to showing the whole picture. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>

Really?  I love xp groups, I can be very effective and make just about any combo work.<br>
<br>
Raiding?  Not even close.  Ask around, find out how many guilds have places for more than two bards on a raid.  Solo?  Bards solo pretty well.  We would be soloing gods if our crap melee didn't limit us to a kill every four minutes.  I see no need whatsoever to up a bards soloing abilities, but I would sure like to know that I was going to be better on a raid at level 60 than I currently am at level 58.<br>

For christ sake, I am talking to a brick wall here!  The chart is a comparison of growth over levels.  Get this through your skulls.  THE BASE NUMBERS COULD HAVE BEEN PICKED OUT OF THIN AIR !!!!  They don't matter!  Set em all at 1 million, it's the same dang graph.  <br>
<br>
Every other class in the game gains power throughout their life cycle as a function of either:<br>
<br>
A.  new spells+ larger mana pool+ increased natural mana regen+ mana regen items<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
B.  Increasing melee effectiveness through increases in skills, items and hit point regen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess what the modifiers for bards are?<br>
<br>
Items + level<br>
<br>
That's it.  This is why the bard power curve is linear rather than exponential.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Guess what?  AE nukes don't make targets dead any faster.  Sure, I could claim my AE DoT was doing 120 DPS due to hitting eight targets at once.<br>
<br>
After I reloaded to my bind point, that is.  <br>
<br>
Same situation with AE song healing.  Either your group is getting hit by AE, and taking one heck of a lot more than 12 pts/ tick damage, or they aren't, and the song isn't affecting health at all.<br>
<br>
Now, did you want to talk about the graphs?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thott's other points are a very sarcastic whine.  Justifiably so.  How would you like to play a class for 3+ years, be in constant contact with the dev team, only to have your class thrown out the window with the garbage?  bards are never considered in class balancing, NEVER.  We get busted almost every patch, and we guess day to day what songs will stack with what spells.  <br>

<br>
I read a good part of that thing when it was first posted and I just stopped.  I know Verant won't do back flips for them any more than they will for us, but I can sum up my fellings ...<br>
<br>
1) Of course fix all the myriad things that are broken and stop breaking them.<br>
<br>
2) If indeed bards got all the things listed in that petition, there would be no other classes in the game since I don't think any ability was left out of the list for improvement (remember we asked for better healing in the form of improving an exisiting spell and possibly adding one more, and one more dot, and maybe just possibly a cold debuff).<br>
<br>
3) Bards are the absolute and final masters of resists and possibly of melee buffs.  They are powerhouses for soloing and ALWAYS welcome on a raid.<br>
<br>
4) Can you think of any guild that is not accepting appropriate level bards who are not utter idiots?  Think about that question again with Necros, Rangers, Paladins, Druids, Shadow Knights.  Mages would probably be in that list if they were not so damn rare.<br>
<br>
5) Bards have had focus items and had them years before anyone else - instruments.  They don't work entirely the same way but no other class had these spell casting augmenting tool until VERY recently.  And while some of the existing focus items would work and make sense for bards, many of them would not.  The ones that increase durations of spells would make twisting easier and could exponentially increase bard power (if you could keep 4 always up and sometimes 5 witha good bard instead of the 3 always up sometimes 4 you can get now). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 5/22/02 9:39:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=falamilwoodhelven>Falamil Woodhelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/22/02 12:03:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27396.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: bards</span><hr size=1> Bards jumping from healing 6 pts to healing 40 pts?<br>

<br>
<br>
There is no bard song that heals for 40 pts a tick, what are you talking about?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With the right AA, and twisting 2 songs, I think I could hit mid-thirties.  I don't know of any way to go higher than that.<br>

<br>
A level 20 bard heals for around 1 pt/sec.  A level 60 bard heals for around 2.5 pt/sec.  Thats an overall increase of 150% over 40 levels.  Take a look at any of the healing classes and tell me their rate of growth is that small.<br>

If you want to consider a Bard's growth in healing, you might want to look first at regen.  We really DON&quot;T go up in regen that much, and truthfully are not ahead of bards.<br>
<br>
Bards having regen at all is a bit of a plum.  It is a better healing option than I think rangers get (tiny direct heals I vaguelly recall). <br>
<br>
Paladins of course are battle priests so to speak, so they do get decent healing.  But having bards be one of the handful of classes that get a healing ability is a bit of a gift. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thorny Ol' Sauerkraut</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/22/02 12:22:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27396.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> &quot;Bards solo pretty well&quot;<br>

If you truely believe that ae spells don't go faster then you are truely clueless. Fear can be cleared in about 1/3 of the time with half the people if the right ae classes and an insane puller is there (we often use a bard for the puller).

..... Adding more targets raises the healing potential of the spell.  That goes for bards too.  That's a LARGE increase, when you multiply 2.5 x 40.

  OOS.  There, bard's are more useful on raids than druids.  Oh but wait, rune or DS on main tank, deftdance for tank switchovers.  Oh but wait, stick another in the cleric group and they're, what, over 30 more mana/tick making KEI look pathetic and healing more rod damage than regrowth of the grove would.  Oh but wait, 105 to resists so the main tank can have hundreds more HPs because they don't need resist gear.  Oh but wait get an add and CHARM.  Oh but wait, meleeing for 60dps is more than wizards and druids nuke for in sustained fights.  We usually have 2 bards on a raid but have had as many as 5, they're ALL useful.  If ZERO druids show up no one could care less, and if 5 show up if we can't land nukes on a mob our NT's are just completely lost in the CH chain and our 15dps melee isn't worth the time to stand up.<br>
 <br>
&quot;THE BASE NUMBERS COULD HAVE BEEN PICKED OUT OF THIN AIR !!!!&quot;<br>

  That is frankly a load of garbage.  Caster natural mana regen pretty much caps at 45 until MC AA.  Larger manapool size is a function of level and items.  In other words A) is items + level.  Like every other meleer bards make out pretty damn good and it's the casters that are getting screwed.<br>
 <br>
  If you want to completely ignore the fact that bards are a MELEE class, go ahead, ignore your ATK going up, the discs you get, the extra damage tables you get, the extra damage avoidance mitigation tables you get, sure.  Hell, lets throw warriors in here too, guess what, they got it even worse, looky, their spell casting ability is a flat line even UNDER the bard!  Sheesh, they're REALLY screwed!<br>
 <br>
&quot;Guess what? AE nukes don't make targets dead any faster. Sure, I could claim my AE DoT was doing 120 DPS due to hitting eight targets at once.&quot;<br>

  No, but it does let a bard + enchanter or bard + shaman be an AE group by themselves.<br>
 <br>
&quot;It's dang frustrating.&quot;<br>

  Next time we get a 4 pull the enchanter charms one the bard the other and we have 4 dead mobs in under a minute I'll remeber that.  What IS frustrating is twisting is a pain in the @#%$ and the reason my bard will never get anywhere and VI's bard fixes/support are even worse than the pitiful job they do with other classes.

It's no understatement at all.  I solo better than a druid, worse than a necro or mage.  <br>

So, you are planning to get MGB to cast regrowth, right?  Geez, just think of your healing potential!<br>
<br>

Would you like me to take that apart for you?  Why don't you do as I asked and see how many guilds have more than two raiding bards?<br>
<br>
1.  OOS is useful in some encounters to get slow in.  It's a dang nice song, and guarantees ONE bard a welcome to a raid.<br>
<br>
2.  Deftdance for switchovers?  You are aware that disciplines are self only?  Are you suggesting that a bard tank during the switch?  <br>
<br>
3.  30 mana per tick?  Sure, if I do nothing else I can get that.  That means a couple extra CHs on a Luclin mob.  If your raid leader reassigns bard songs based on one healer in the group he is a goober.<br>
<br>
4.  Charm adds?  ROTFLMAO!!  You are aware that the level on bard charm is capped at 51?  No?  <br>
<br>
5.  60 DPS?  There isn't a single bard on any server that melees anywhere near that number.  My personal DPS runs about 27, epicced bards with higher end weaponry can get mid 40s on the right mobs.<br>
<br>
6.  <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No, but it does let a bard + enchanter or bard + shaman be an AE group by themselves.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Once again, ROTFLMAO!  Let's see, with three dots I can put out about 27-28 DPS by swapping instruments.  Grats four minutes kills again.<br>
<br>
Bards get upgraded like other melee?  Bub, I think you need to play your bard more.  Bard melee damage sucks.  Bard damage mitigation sucks.  Bard taunt sucks.  If it weren't for the versatility, the class wouldn't be worth playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucclothar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ccLothar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/22/02 2:02:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27396.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> I never considered Bards to be all that broke.

By the way, we have two bards in our little guild who only need the undead Bard to finish their epic.  We have two Druids with epic, so it's not that bad.<br>

<br>
A Druid MGB'ing regrowth DOES have an enormous healing potential.  To say it doesn't is completely false.  Bards do that without AA skills or mana, not to mention the fact that it has other benefits to the song and it stacks with other regens.  Regening hp and mana for a raid party indefinitely is a huge benefit.<br>
<br>
To think that adding 25% haste to a group of melee and to yourself isn't effective, then I don't understand what you're looking at.  Bards not only increase their own damage, they increase the damage potential of everyone around them.  This doesn't take into account DS'ing the main tank, or OOS for the casters.  Nor does it take into account the combine effects of melee and mana regen for the nukers.  All for zero mana and alot of wrist damage.  Not to mention they wear plate for protection, which is more than Druids and other pure casters get.<br>
<br>
Thott did alot of work, and I think he's truly concerned for the class he's chosen.  I don't agree with drawing comparisons to a class that can't buff, heal, slow, debuff, melee or whatever else I've missed, and saying you are underpowered in comparison.<br>
<br>
And none of these songs are given to Bards at lvl 1, so as Bards level and get better songs, their power increases.  Saying otherwise, and creating graphs based on less then half the story isn't the way to go about it.  Get the bugs fixed, that's all a Bard needs.  Or maybe an Anicent song or two. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>

That is an increase of about 1567%. The healing potential of a druid using mgb to cast rotg is still less than an epic bard and costs 1200 mana vs 0 mana for the bard. At this point, I don't personally know any druids that have mgb high on the list of skills they are shooting for.<br>
<br>
BTW, my guild usually has two bards and often we have four bards when doing larger raids like NToV. I believe we have a total of six active bards in the guild. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>

Compare how a bard song progresses in a linear fashion, where for other classes the mana pool increases with level. So the bard song remains on a linear scale where as the other class spell grows expontial due to the increasing mana pool, and after caster re-balance spells may even cost less. That is not to say when bards are considered they may be modified. It would be best to get our concerns out before that happens, then afterwards.<br>
<br>
Another key thing to remember is &quot;What is Verant using to balance classes&quot;, I don't think they would ever give all the details since that would create huge can of worms. So every approach to class balance is a guess on our part. So perhaps a desire for a class (exp/raids) is included into balance ? You guess is as good as mine. We can only work with things we do know.<br>
<br>
My own opinion as a bard is to raise our mez cap, since it is currently limited to 54 mobs and below, and make sure we are balanced in regards to hybrid melee capability(offense/defense). Most of the arguments for bards, and possibly druids is the high-end 60s game, where zones like Cazic Thule has stripped both the bard and the druid of their pulling abilities.<br>
<br>
This Thott post has been around for a long time, where AE mana didn't even exist, or any of the Luclin songs. I don't think any bard argues some of the new AA abilities and songs go towards things we view as good change to the class. But in the past bards changes for every expansion have been worked on jsut prior to release. We often wonder if they even have anyone that plays the class in regards to development.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Tett, bards get a more varied song lineup, not a more powerful one.  There is a difference, akin to the supposed &quot;penalty&quot; a druid pays in the healing department in return for being able to dot, nuke, port, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's pretty simple folks.  Take a head count on the next raid.  Now, what classes are struggling?<br>
<br>
1.  Mages<br>
2.  necros (maybe not?  sounds like they have had a few upgrades recently)<br>
3.  Druids<br>
4.  bards<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, one bard on a raid is great.  Two is cool, they can relax a bit.  More than two, you are better off having another class filling in.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the power curves have absolutely no effect on this.  /sigh<br>
<br>
Absor, give bards their own buff box!!!<br>
