Yzan I'gzn as Tvesh strolled by them in the Neriak Quarters.<br>
<br>
&quot;We have had reports of stolen goods lately,&quot;  the<br>
other grumbled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tvesh?&quot;  the guard called as Tvesh staggered by, <br>
&quot;how are you old friend?  You seem as strong as ever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am doing well this evening, and yourself?&quot;  Tvesh<br>
replied, staring back with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am on duty tonight.  Much has gone astray the past<br>
few nights, it will be my best,&quot; he commented.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, so I have heard.  The best of luck to you and<br>
farewell!&quot;  he said as he began to walk away.<br>
<br>
The guard waved, &quot;And a good night to you!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Such good friends,&quot; he thought, &quot;what is possibly so<br>
evil about us?&quot;  he shrugged and exited Neriak into<br>
the dark woods of Nektulos.<br>
<br>
It was a very dark and gloomy Nektulos evening.  Tvesh<br>
made way and proceeded oward the bridge with the sweet<br>
river which he used to play around when he was just achild. <br>
He smiled to himself inside.<br>
<br>
Reaching the river, he took his seat alongside the<br>
water.  He released a great sigh and begun to try to<br>
understand the dream as he had last night as he<br>
unsheathed his sword.<br>
<br>
His mind started to wander.  What did she return for? <br>
What is it she wants?  He shook his head and tried to<br>
ward off the parelless thoughts.<br>
<br>
Colosing his eyes, he felt a sence of something<br>
inside, a strang auro about him.  He turned around<br>
very quickly to check the surroundings around him in<br>
search of something.  Night had fallen, and it had<br>
begun to rain.<br>
<br>
He sighed again and stared into nothingness.  &quot;My mind<br>
tricks me again,&quot; he said to himself as he calmly<br>
turned his head back around.<br>
<br>
There she was all the sudden.  Right in front of him. <br>
That wonderless angel set free to fly bound only by<br>
his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello again, Tvesh,&quot;  she said.<br>
<br>
Tvesh stumbled back into suprise, tripping over the<br>
hilt of his sword.<br>
A swift wind went over his clothes, chilling him as<br>
the rain poured down.  He gazed upon her in amazement.<br>
She was wearing a midnight gown that fluttered in the<br>
wind like an angel's wings.  She moved around only in<br>
a slightly blury image, as if a ghost  -- or much less<br>
a dream, Tvesh thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha...what do you want?&quot;  Tvesh said.<br>
&quot;Why...you, Tvesh,&quot;  she replied.<br>
<br>
Tvesh was pulling off his hooded shirt now and handing<br>
it to her.  She looked as if she had been wandering<br>
around the woods for quite awhile, perhaps in search<br>
of him, perhaps not -- he didn't know.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now who is going to catch his death?&quot;  she giggled,<br>
pointing at his massive bare chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Forgive me, but -- &quot;  he started, as he was<br>
interrupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tvesh!&quot;<br>
<br>
The voice seemed so familiar to him, as he heard his<br>
name called.  He turned his face to get a better view.<br>
It was his master, the one man of Dark Elven heritage<br>
who had taught him everything of the warrior ways. <br>
The man who had trained him since he was a child.  He<br>
respected him like a father.<br>
<br>
Tvesh watched as random images from his past unfolded<br>
in front of him.  All the punishing training he had<br>
taken to become an Indigo Warrior, to become the best.<br>
The intense satisfaction on his face as he first held<br>
a sword.  It was the one thing that belonged to him<br>
wholly and utterly.  Without warning, an image flashed<br>
before his eyes, then he could see again.<br>
<br>
The man glared at the young lady, raising his sword in<br>
her direction for a thretening stance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Filty wench!&quot; he yelled as he charged at her.  She<br>
screamed, moving behind Tvesh for protection.  Tvesh<br>
adjusted the grip on his sword and hastened to meet<br>
his master.<br>
<br>
Steel met steel with a resounding clash as two blades<br>
met.  Tvesh disengaged first, spinning a full circle<br>
to attack with a slash.  He twisted, deflecting<br>
Tvesh's blade and countering with a thrust.  Tvesh<br>
caught the weapon, with his sword, locking the blades<br>
hilt to hilt in a move that brought them face to face.<br>
His eyes were cold and impassive.  Tvesh knew he had<br>
to control his anger and keep a cool head.  Unbridled<br>
rage aid against lesser opponents, but was folly when<br>
faced with one equally skilled.  He heaved suddenly,<br>
throwing Tvesh back.<br>
<br>
He went with the move, heeding the distance to regain<br>
inner equilibrium.  He attacked swiftly, his blade<br>
wailing a song of death.  Tvesh met him with a<br>
sequence that was designed to both defend and attack. <br>
He was shocked when his opponent launched into a<br>
series of moves expressly conceived to break his<br>
sequence.  He executed all the right manuevers,<br>
failing his offence routine again and again, but Tvesh<br>
matched him, deterring his attacks.<br>
<br>
Under the brilliant moonlight, they fought on long<br>
into the night without either side gaining the<br>
slightest of any advantage.  They moved like partners<br>
in a dance, a deadly fatal dance.  Tvesh swept his<br>
blade in a series of feints in an attempt to lure him<br>
into a mistake.  He countered one with a slash across<br>
his chest.<br>
<br>
They withfrew and stood apart, regarding each other. <br>
Tvesh was starting to feel exhausted.  He looked down<br>
and exaimened his wound.  A ghastly red line scored<br>
his chest, with fresh blood dropping down his abdomen.<br>
<br>
Tvesh took a gamble and charged with his sword in a<br>
thrust, fully expecting him to spin away of the<br>
blade's path.  His eyes widened with surprise as<br>
his blade met not the resistance of steel, but the<br>
soft resistance of flesh.  The sword sunk through his<br>
abdoment to the hilt.  He drew his sword free with a<br>
sickening wrench.<br>
<br>
Blood still warm splattered upon Tvesh's face as he<br>
looked upon his opponent, fear and suprise both frozen<br>
on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ni...s...ai,&quot;  Tvesh wispered as he got up and tried<br>
to walk towards her, one hand still on his now<br>
profusly bleeding chest.<br>
<br>
She caught him as he fell, bright red blood gushing<br>
from the terrible wound.  His mind was in turmoil, his<br>
world was crumbling down in that instance.  She<br>
cradled him cushioning her head against his shoulders<br>
as she gently lifted him up.  Her fair sparkled<br>
through the rain, a reflection of beauty.  With<br>
trembling fingers he reached out for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nisai...Nisai,&quot;  he touched her face, unable to<br>
believe his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ni...sai, I'm...so...glad...it was...you...I..wanted<br>
to...die...Now, I...can...leave...in peace.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No!  No! You must live now that I've found you. <br>
Come, there is help at Freeport.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No...listen to...me.  There is...no...time..I...have<br>
so much...to...tell you..yet so...little...time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't say anymore.  You'll live, you promised me. <br>
Don't leave me again,&quot;  she cried wretchedly, holding<br>
her hand to his lips.<br>
<br>
Tvesh hugged her closer to him.  Her face against his.<br>
Her eyes were brimming with love and unshed tears. <br>
He wiped them away with a gentle hand, kissing her.<br>
<br>
She reached out a hand, cupping his face.<br>
<br>
He smiled and closed his eyes.  His hand fell limply. <br>
Everything turned black as he fainted... <p><FONT FACE = "helvetica" FONT SIZE = "2"><CENTER><IMG ALT="One Winged Angel" SRC="http://wvu.edu/~jshinkov/anahsig.jpg"><BR>
