<br>
The argument I've heard &quot;but they shouldn't be&quot; seems grossly inadequate given that currently they ARE, and the other argument &quot;we didn't think we were poaching&quot; wears thin when it happens twice in a week.  Either way, let's settle it.<br>
<br>
Proposal:<br>
Remove Sol B Fire Giants from the reservation list.<br>
<br>
Discussion:<br>
Personally I disagree with my own motion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but it is more important to me that we get it on the table to discuss and resolve than that my particular view win.  Here's what I can see as pro's and con's:<br>
IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION:<br>
 - Folks are ever more inclined to ignore the reservation board, at least with respect to FGs.  Recognize an accomplished act of piracy.  Yes I know that's morally slimy people, please don't flame me for expressing it.  Fact is it's been done unto me this week, and I've already seen many folks argue much the same thing even among the victims.  I'm just giving voice to it here.<br>
 - They require little or no more than a group to do.  One does not want to reserve sub-raid-level mobs.<br>
 - They are &quot;relatively&quot; fast spawners.<br>
 - The loot is mostly high-priced &quot;trash&quot; with a couple of good items (Tranix crown, e.g.) rarely dropped.<br>
 - It's one less thing for the mods to deal with.  Do not underestimate that as a real virtue.<br>
<br>
OPPOSING THE MOTION:<br>
 - Given the difference between European time and US time, if the European guilds or groups decided to camp them as targets-in-themselves or for Ragefire for several days straight, we in the US would not see the FGs for that time.  The US groups could have a similar impact on Pacific-based players, though I think that's less as the time differences now exceed FG spawn time.<br>
 - They remain surpassing good exercise/experience for up and coming raiders, of comparable level, difficulty and geography as Nagafen (and to a slightly lesser degree only, of Vox).  IF you accept FGs as a &quot;training raid&quot; then asking would-be raid leaders to accept a burden of learning their craft while trying to fit around other raids in progress is asking too much.<br>
 - That they CAN be taken out by a single group does not mean they are/must be.  If you don't have a 'chanter along, you need superior healing or firepower or tanking to make up the defiency.  A single group of 60s could dominate much of &quot;old&quot; hate at least and make a nice dent on the second floor, but I do not see anyone moving to make Hate unreservable.  That's because a substantial amount of the population still has need for the old system.  The &quot;one group can do it&quot; argument in effect says if you aren't in your high 40s or above, you don't do FGs - and that is NOT how a lot of the old school raiders did it.<br>
<br>
OK.   sigh, flame away.<br>

I now believe they should be FCFS for a few reasons:<br>
<br>
1) They block access to Ragefire who is unreservable.<br>
2) There are now more places for the level 40 to 50 crowd to raid as their &quot;first raiding experience&quot;    <br>
..... a) Frost Giants from the EW zone into the Frost Giant Castle are great for a high 30ish low 40ish raid.<br>
   ..... b) Storm Giants from the GD zone up to the bank area are great for a high 40ish raid.<br>
 .....   c) Skyshrine up to the 2nd pool room is great for a 40ish raid.<br>
 .....   d) City of Mist now seems to be a hot raiding area for the 40ish crowd.<br>
  .....  e) Velks Laby has held mid/high 40ish raids.<br>
.....    f) Icewell Keep dwarves is a mid to high 40ish raid area with some nice armor and spell drops.<br>
.....    g) I've seen raids in Skyfire (3 groups of high 30ish low 40ish characters taking on wurms and wyverns)<br>
.....    h) I've seen 3 groups of high 30s low 40s fighting rares in Trakanon (damn nice loot for a level 40)<br>
3) Most of the people doing Fire Giants are not new raiders.<br>
4) The respawn and demand for Fire Giants aren't as long or as high as Vox/Naggy/VS/Trak<br>
<br>
Before and even during Kunark Fire Giants were about the only place for raiders to get a feel for large scale raiding.  With Kunark and now Velious there are many other places to go for raiding at the 40 to 50 level.  Add to that the need to get to Ragefire, I believe that firegiants should be FCFS. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=View&Profile=0&Id=60309">Jaradis Stormcaller - 51st Mystic - Guild Leader - Mystic Dominion</a><br>

<br>
I would like to still see the FG's reservable by a group with 10 or more people under 50, given the provision that if Ragefire is up, a group may go through to get to him.<br>
<br>
As for the level of difficulty, I've done FG's several times with 3 people on 4 characters.  While we could do it with 2 people, it's just faster to have the 4 characters there.<br>
<br>
It's not necessarily slime that will disrespect reservations.  If ragefire was up, and FG's were booked solid through all the times you had friends available to kill him, the FG's would present an unreasonable problem.  The fact that a FG reservation can block a Ragefire raid seems wrong. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uorri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fire Brand</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/12/01 6:16:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Formal motion to make Fire Giants Unreservable</span><hr size=1> can an FG raid lock a naggy raid? we were respectful to FG raids, when our nagafen came up after a server patch.

<br>
1. Last time, everyone voted on a lie, people kept spouting BS about how it was 'tradition' and 'you guys learned stuff there too' when the truth was that the powerful guilds (or at least mine) didn't learn jack shit at FG but we just cleared them for fun, spur of the moment with 2 or 3 groups pre kunark(ie not planned 2 weeks in advance and with 40+ people attending).<br>
<br>
2. FG reservation as is serves ZERO constructive purpose, it's used for 1 of 3 things.<br>
<br>
1. For Clerics to pull some bullshit Ragefire reservation, basically to hijack his spawn.<br>
<br>
2. The same as above but with Nagafen.<br>
<br>
3. Random 50+ person does them with 1 group for the tranix crown.<br>
<br>
They're not even being used as they were intended when the rule was created, plus if you want raid training grounds there are tons of places to go now.<br>
<br>
Face it. FG Reservations are dead as the dodo now. A majority of the server dislikes them and rightfully so. Just need to formalize it with a vote. <p>nillon<br>

But, I do think this needs to be brought up again.  I don't have any investment in the moment one way or the other.  But, I've given it careful consideration.  And, after changing my mind several times, I have definately decided to remain uncertain.<br>
<br>
But, I do think there are enough people that want this brought back on the voting board.  If the votes remain to keep them reservable, okay.  If the vote decides these mobs are not worthy of taking up reservation space, and the arguements can be avoided, good.<br>
<br>
Brell has a special type of system.  This system can only be respected if the majority of the voices can be heard.  There are people that get a lot of attention on BS.net because of the many posts they have made, or the name they have made for themselves in game.  But, those select few do not control the server, no matter how much they control the boards.<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever watched the voter turn out in their own cities?  In the United States, voter turnout is about 20 percent, with a huge 60 percent on presidental elections (the only exception I know of was a 220 percent voter turnout when Kansas was being voted in as a &quot;free&quot; or &quot;slave&quot; state when it entered the Union).  If a vote is decided, there needs to be some sort of guildwide or serverwide support to get voters here. <p>Razorclaw<BR>53rd Monk<BR>Maximus<BR><div align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Razorclaw</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">,

I do feel that if ragefire is up then he should take precedence over the FG's.  Just as Naggy takes precedence over them.  However it's distressing to me to see some of the comments being made;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've done FG's several times with 3 people&quot;<br>
&quot;FG's are so laughable easy it's pathetic they are reserved&quot;<br>
<br>
Comments like these have been made here and in rants and have the trend of being made by those in the 50+ range.  People need to get off thier high horse, sure FG's are easy for you.  They'd be easy for anyone in that level range but it doesn't seem right that they are dictating what should happen with these mobs.  <br>
<br>
There are still people in that level range that they are appropiate for.  The UNB tries to fairly regularly raid FG's as a guild activity.  We have a scheduled raid Sunday in fact.  It gives our members something to plan for and gets our members together.  We've had people ranging from low 40's to upper 50's with usually 3 groups being the norm.  Is it overkill?  Sure, but it gives us small timers something to plan for and the UNB isn't the only one that does that.<br>
<br>
I'm fairly certain that this call for the removal of them being reserved will pass simply due to that fact that the majority here are those in the high game, or at least, are the most outspoken.<br>

I will hold my opinion on the matter till a vote happens.<br>
<br>
I realize things change in-game (Ragefire/New fear/hate are good examples), but these are all rules we work with to make the server work. We shouldn't change them every month..we should wait to make sure change is needed. We have done this with Ragefire (hence my belief a vote should happen). <br>
<br>
But I do see the side that it has been voted on before.<br>
how long is a vote &quot;SAFE&quot; from being changed? <br>
<br>
I personally don't want to vote on everything every month. Or when it inconviences a few vocal people. <br>
<br>
If the FG's are re-voted on. I would also like to see a time frame set BEFORE anyone can ask for a re-vote. A term-MINIMUM you may call it. Like 6 months-12 months. And to force a re-vote, a &quot;Critical Mass&quot; (alot like were seeing here today..lots of people coming out for the change..and not many sticking up for it) would have to be displayed before a vote happens.<br>
<br>
I just don't like the idea of changing rules on a whim, and want to protect the integrity of the system, so feel changes should be few and far between.<br>

If we remove the FG Reservations then:<br>
<br>
We need to remove the Naggy reservations because Ragefire can't be up unless Naggy is dead so that must mean that Naggy's list is a hinderance to Rage. So Naggy should become FCFS.<br>
<br>
Any other mobs that drop Epic pieces must be FCFS.  I think that means a good chunk of Kunark dragons.<br>
<br>
So a vote for FCFS for FG's on the PRETEXT of a bottleneck in the cleric epic is a vote towards Brell becoming a free for all server.<br>
<br>
I strongly oppose removing the FG's from the reservation list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uredspinebladeslinge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Redspine Bladeslinge</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 905<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/13/01 8:50:58 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.yellowspine.com/images/jestur01.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bah</span><hr size=1> I would dissagree with removing FG.  If all you that want Ragefire think taking FG out of the reservation is going to free him up more it's not.  It only frees him up more for certain people/guilds.<br>
<br>
If you really need Ragefire, coordinate with the FG Raid to cap him once they finish clearing.  I do this with my Naggie raids, why bother with FG when someone else will do all that work for you and you just walk in and kill the dragon.<br>
<br>
FG will become a 1 group camp, is this good or bad &lt;shrug&gt;.  I'll certainly go kill them with a group if they aren't reservable.  They are fun and you can still make some cash off the drops. <br>
<br>
I hear all this talk about so many places now that can be raided.  Well, if there are so many places now that can be raided whats wrong with ONE place being reservable?  I don't buy the Ragefire thing, see above paragraph.<br>

Some of them are the same people who say they are now practically strictly &quot;velious&quot; guilds or they haven't touched them in so long.  Just what is the motivation of people who are primarily level 60 that campaign to make them FFA?  Don't you have somewhere in Velious to go?  Pfft.<br>

It is true that a number of smaller guilds do in fact raid FG for training purposes.  Nilon amd the others who hold a simlar view, I say this respectfuly, I belive your perspective is off because you have been at a high level for a long enough time that you have forgotten what it is like to be inexperienced and underpowered re weapons and equipement.  A good percentage of people are like that, and FG raids do serve a definate purpose for them.<br>
<br>
I am troubled however, that people rant with such venom and mean spirited feelings when there is conflict around FGs.  Frankly, if a raid gets underminded as in the recent probelm with Orri and Enshadowed, it should be worked out in game.  Truely dishonorable acts and treachory I do like seeing ranted about, but communication break downs or mistakes give us all the impression that we cannot get a long, and frankly this is not the case.  Many, many guilds try very hard to work things out on Brell, it is only when a small number fail that we get rants, or when an individual with too much passion gets a bit too worked up.<br>
<br>
I belive FGs shoud remain reservalble, for this reason.  NOT as a training ground for raiding, but rather a training ground for problem solving/conflict resolution.  FGs are an excelllent place for peole to learn how to share, not how to plan a raid.  They learn to communicate with other guilds, and how to make things work, and when they coomunicate badly and come ranting to the boards, they get a chance for the brell community to say, for example, hey Orri, relax, this can be worked out and everyone can win, instead of someone being &quot;punished&quot; for trying to play the game.  Iremember killing FGs and getting a tell from the good Knight Thorndar, asking when we would be done so he could come with his crew and kill ragefire.  We coordianted it, he came after we were done and I belive was succesful.  No problems, no conflict, 2 happy raiding partners.  I beleive the majority of guilds on Brell act this way<br>
<br>
FGs serve this purpose, and for the good of the community, I think they need to be kept reservable.<br>

<br>
The first is when a Naggy Raid is taking place. This rarely causes problems because both are scheduled raids and can be worked out. The second is with Ragefire. He is a Non-reservable mob that stands behind these reservable mobs.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted to maintain the spirit of why FG's where made reservable there are a few things you could do.<br>
<br>
1) Adun(e) posted an idea of restricting the reservation to 40's only. This would lower the amount of reservations and would have more open days for FG's to be taken down for Ragefire and since that crew should in no way be going after Ragefire another group can get ready for ragefire while the lower lvls are killing the FG's (CR should be easy since what high lvl raid going after Ragefire would help out on CR to get the raid moving again?).<br>
<br>
2) A long time ago someone posted an idea of making a reservation only for certain days and the other days would be FCFS.<br>
<br>
3) Allow any Ragefire raid to supercede any FG raid. With the use of a mule or a tracker you can tell if Ragefire is up without taking down a single FG.<br>
<br>
For those wanting to keep FG's reservable what compromise can you think of that allows a training ground to be kept while allowing those that need the final epic MOB to have a chance at getting it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthorondar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorondar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 435<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/13/01 11:11:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.watchers-brell.com/images/thor-shirt.jpg height=177 width=162></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Saphdia</span><hr size=1> Not if they're trying to complete a cleric epic they can't go to Vellious.<br>
