In fact - Fear was the only Plane. When they opened Hate - is when Class specific armor occured, but before then it was Cryosilk for casters and I can't even remember the name of the armor for Melee. This was before my time ... and NOTE - NO ONE WAS OVER 50 ... even though the MoBs are 48-52 and the Boss MoBs - like CT 55.<br><br>The way it was done ... and I have the pleasure of doing it this way ... was everyone ran in invis. and mad a mad dash to the North wall (APPROX Loc:P1400 P500). Behind the Firewall from where the Firewall starts going west to east - until it ends is a SAFE spot. NO MOBS wander through here. So if a cleric was under attack ... peeps would attck the mob(s) and the cleric would make camp and camp. This got real problematic if a cleric didn't make it - and sometimes the cleric would have to attemp over and over until one made it. Then monks would drag all the dead bodies to camp ... and the cleric would log in and begin rezzes. This process takes about 3 hours - before you even start pulling.<br><br>Then the concept of West Wall breaking started - but even Gratiano from Inner Fire has stated, &quot;This type of break is for those who have gear and levels&quot;. In other words if you are taking a bunch of 46 lvl peeps in RO armor quest - it would be better for a North wall break - because in the end - the number of MoBs that come ... and the skill it takes ... usually waxes most teams that attempt the West Wall.<br><br>The NORMAL way WEST wall is broken is that a necro, sk, or monk will go in the portal and FD on top of the hill. They will then use the camera views in 3rd person (the 3rd F9 from first person shooter mode - or 1 F9 from the 3rd person Tomb Raider View) and will rotate the camera around and watch the patterns of the MoBS. When the West wall, the Hill, and the surrounding arae is clear - the call for insertion is made. Usually 2 groups at a time go in invis - 10-15 secs apart and make the wall and begin fighting as neccessary.<br><br>THE REASON THE WEST WALL IS SO BAD - is that MOST PEOPLE NEVER CALL EVAC if it is bad. I had to shut KANDON up the other day as he spewed FALSE instructions over Pimm and my own. If your chanters call EVAC - cause LoM or TOO many mobs - get the heck out - don't wait - kill a few - and do it again - eventuly - even if it is 3 runs - you will have the wall broken. People that stay and fight to the bitter end - ALL DIE and ALL gear is on the west wall.<br><br>Now I got to try it this way a couple of times ... once was a Rider's break - and low and behold no evac - and we all die. The problem with this is - going in naked and trying to hold the wall is very hard. It is hard when the chanters don't have ac gear to take the hits - nor the mana to keep the influx of MoBs coming mezzed. This method (because no evac was called) results in about 3 attempts - with tons of bodies - and someone like IF - SA - COT - or another guild now that we have some higher lvl guilds out there to come do a rescue mission.<br><br>Watching Inner Fire save raids over and over again - I noticed that they would always evac if it got bad or a chanter called evac. I have Inner Fire to thank for teaching me - to pick my battles - and that evaccing and trying again is a good thing.<br><br>NOW ... enter PIMMSTRAHD. Originally - it was Venr and I that began discussing this - as we wanted to host a raid - but both of us were chicken to do it by ourselves ... so we decided a joint effort would help. Besides the inability to recover - there is ALWAYS someone that seems to go RIGHT out of the portal - or even STRAIGHT ... and then train the camp with Tenticle Terrors or the Fetid Fiend house ... or I have even seen Boogymen on a break - yes - from the BOOGY HOUSE. Note that those 5-6 extra mobs can be enough to get the chanters or other casters like clerics that need to med - and sitting - they are the first targets of these extra mobs. So - what to do - ... MAKE SURE NO MOBS (or very few - due to roaming patterns) are at the portal or West Wall.<br><br>So - I get Uber Buffed - and get Harmshield ready. When all groups are ready ... I zone in with Harmshield up - and make a circle around the portal (trust me - you don't go to the base of the hill - aggro is plenty big enough) and then head North - preferably to the West a hair - as the TT will dispell your SOW - and then you will wipe out - and more mobs will be on the west wall quicker than before. So - pass up the Fetid House - NOTE - the fetids are slow - and wont keep up - BUT - there can be a Worry Wraith in there at times - and they love to cast their Stuns - so make sure you are holding down that run button. By the time you make the fire wall - the Harm Shield and Rune V (Or Diamondshield ... blah blah blah) has worn off but you should be in front of most of the mobs. Hit the North wall ... and begin your circle in the NW corner - counterclock-wise.<br><br>You make the call for insert - about the time you are at the Fetid House ... and walla ... people come in - and 9 times out 10 - no mobs - and if so - most adds and mobs are 3 - and very easy to maintain.<br><br>NOW - Venr and my method was this - that after all peeps got it - i just stopped running - maybe tried to FD - but for the most part - I would eat the death. I have 3 hours for my one corpse to get xp - and we can break and pull north to my body. With my death - Mobs would stand around and be stupid - until the next move cycle was implemented - then they would continue their normal roam pattern or return to their staic points. Thus - west wal;l would get like 1-2 maybe 3 at a time - but everyone was there and ready to fight - no one dies on the way down ... and pretty solid. Our first try at this theory was a success and the day we took CT.<br><br>So - Pimm sees the success of this ... and NOW AT POST 50 LEVELS - says to me - you could do that - and I can CoH you back to camp - and you don't have to die. So - Pimm and I start trying this out - and it works. NOTE - I still die sometimes - dang frightfinger was on west wall once - and there are only so many laps you can make till you bite it.<br><br>We still evac if for some reason someone manages to train us - even though we clear the portal (yes - as clear as the portal is - you can still have a YELLOW TOWER TRAIN) - and that is the real key in keeping gear.<br><br>SO WHAT ABOUT WHIPEOUTS: Well - then I run the mobs again ... the good thing is that some have evaced with gear - and the others make camp - and can loot corpses (but leave the bags) and be fully geared up ready to go again. Since We have implemented this strategy - we have not had to get help for breaking - even in the case of a bad break. NOTE - sometimes FEAR is mean ... deal with it ... I have done so many breaks now - and run the gauntlet so many times ... and for those of you that know me - know that Fear is my home ... sometimes on the pop - the mix of MoBs can be a harsh mix - like 90% Scares and very little spiders and apes.<br><br>A NEW TACTIC: I think it was Halaman (sp) that mentioned this to me - but this idea I have heard comes from TCC (maybe they got it somewhere - but I haven't heard of anyone else using it) is that they have a group formed with a 55 mage that can CoH. They get the mage to North camp - and leave the other person on the outside of the portal. The person outside the portal is the Group Leader ... and invites peeps into the group ... and when they zone in - the mage CoH the person to the North wall. Sounds pretty cool - and I have heard that it is a pretty successful strategy. The danger with this one is getting the mage to north camp and that CoH is a 10 second cast time (last I heard - I am not a mage). Other than that - sounds pretty dang safe to me.<br><br>All in all - you have to find one that works best for you. A lot has changed since pre-kunark and now levels alone can be the factor. I mean - IF and SA - can march in and pretty much own the west wall due to levels, gear, and experience - so they don't have to rely on other tactics and teaching new peeps things. The hardest thing is the newbies to Fear. Especially if it is their first plane raid ever. A lot of nervousness - lack of understanding - lack of skill - if you got too much of that - you will probably wipe out. Doesn't mean you will ... but chances are you will.<br><br>A good mix to have on the break is 3 chanters and 3 clerics (I know that there are high lvl chanters that can hold this by themselves - but this is a general raiding party). Yes - make sure you have Necros - not only does their gear drop there - but have at least one necro per enchanter - and DESIGNATE a chanter to that necro - so the chanter always has mana. Have an evacer per team - which should be easy as there are TONS of druids that wanna go - but wizards too. Then get some beefy tanks. Mix in the specials - like bards and shamans - and you got it made. It would be interesting to know what IF and SA use - since they do the break with 12 or less usually ( I have seen IF do it with 12 - and I trust Sonic's word that SA does with 6 ).<br><br><br><br>Plane of Fear 1.0.2 - Some Understandings ...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>My previous post was for break types and styles ... this one is a fear primer for anyone relatively new to the plane of fear. NOTE: I really didn't find one when I first went - not even at safehouse - as there was only a guide for pulling hate.<br><br>Listen to the Raid Leader: it is their raid. Other peoeple may ooc or shout (which they shouldn't), but in the end - the raid leader is calling the shots. This also means - even though you are feeling ansy cause the leader is working on no shows or groups ... be patient and attenative. You really don't want to miss one piece of information that may save your or more important - the RAIDS life. Wait until the end of instructions and until the raid leader says 'Are there any more questions?' before you ask him or her something. They have a billion tells and things going on ... so once again ... be patient.<br><br>NOTE what type of break it is going to be: It is important that you know if it is going to be North or West. The two different breaks have different strategies - and if you go the wrong way - not only will you die - but you, yes by yourself, can have teh whole raid killed and in a sticky spot. IF WEST &lt;------ GO LEFT out of the portal ... and down the hill to camp. There are now 2 different North varietions ... so listen to the leader.<br><br>Make sure that you get the Primary and Secondary Assist down: That means make hot keys with /assist PriamryPerson and another with /assist SecondaryPerson<br><br>Be Patient: The time it takes to coordinate a raid can sometimes be shifted due to circumstances. Once you get in a pattern with a well established raid group - things will go faster - but note - it takes time.<br><br>Invisibility: Once upon a time - it seemed that everything would come after you no matter what. But as I have spent much time in Fear - I have experimented with invis and the mobs. Note - if you are a ShadowKnight or a Necro and don't have a Circlet of Shadows - you are WRONG - it is the best thing next to Jboots. Even when I have pulled ... I will invis up to 'lesson' the aggro radius and to scout for monks and such.<br><br>It was during these times that I noticed that less and less mobs really detected invisibity. I had ruled out Tentitle Terrors due to once getting dispelled from them as I ran through them invis - and was still invis when I did, but the truth is - THEY DON'T see invis. In Fact - I have pulled a corpse out of the graveyard and I mean CENTER - if not closer to the gorgon roost with Turmoil Toads - Fetid Feinds - Worry Wraiths - Amy Knights and Warrios all around me. No aggro. I notice that more and more - mobs con indifferent when I am invis - and have confirmed that EVERY MOB is indifferent to invis at one point or another.<br><br>BUT - I have also noticed that there are SOME that do see invis. Now this is one of 2 things. A) I have aggroed a mob - and don't know it - and when i go out invis - it is still aggro on me and it doesn't matter if I am invis - it is a scowling mob. B) I am convinced that there are some mobs - probably the frightfingers ... but could be any of the caster type MoBs (Worry Wraiths - Glare Lords) that cast See Invis on MoBs. Kinda like in Sol A. There are those wizzies and shamans you just can't get by - they see invis.<br><br>Examply - same night - I go back into the GY to drag another body ... I am just North of the Boogy House ... and I am standing with the toads and gorgons and all the other baddies that hang there ... and so I start heading north - trying to get this loc on the body. (I am not about to cast locate corpse in the middle of all these mobs ... my nutsack is shrivled enough thank you). So ... I am heading north and thanks to my SB Live (which btw - helps me pull as I can hear about everything in the zone ... and where it is coming from) I hear the speed up steps of a Fetid Fiend t my right. I look - and sure enough - here it comes ... note - nothing else has attacked me yet - but I know what is going to happen - so I bolt towards the firewall ... and you know what - even though I am invis - I start a train ... the other MOBS that there - pick up on the aggro and start on me - I see a WW start to cast - and at this point I figure I am dead. But I make it out - and make the west wall behind the Fetid House (which was broken - and everyone has moved to the North Camp - cause we were doing CR for someone else) and luckily FD. So I /q out and come back - and try again ... same thing - it is this ONE Fetid Fiend in the North Part of the Graveyard. Everything else was cool ... so we ended up getting a coffin for that one.<br><br>Other Times - like this past Saturday - after Guinn left - I was elected to pull (and btw - thank you Pimm and HHeather - I love pulling) - so I start - I get invis to scout and see the MoB layout ... and then get within aggro range and click off invis ... and mr baddy comes a chasin ... which I take it back and do the monk thing. I did this from West Wall to the Glare Lords on the East side - and had moved the peeps to the Frightfinger house. NOT once did I get prematurely aggroed because I was invis.<br><br>BUT NOTE - some mobs do see - for whatever reason - and when they do - the other stuff will aggro you.<br><br>Regardless - I know for a FACT that invis is very important - and when you break - YOU SHOULD ALWAYS have invis on.<br><br><br>Plane of Fear 1.0.3 - MoBs - Break and West Wall<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I suspect that many a chanter could write this better than I, but here is my attempt at bringing some light to the MoBs in Fear.<br><br>Break and West Wall: The MAIN roamers of the West wall consist of 3 sets. The North to South Patrol that walks mainly along the west wall itself - but pathing does include some that move NW to SE and these MoBs will end up walking up the hill to the portal. The East to West Patrol on the North side of the hill. These guys roam from the Graveyard to the West wall. They go from the bottom of the hill on the north side ... and extend to the firewall - always appears to be the one set near the hill and one set near the fire wall. Last you have the East to West Patrol on the South Wall. This includes the one mob (usually either a Fetid Fiend or an Amy Warrior) that walks up to the back of the portal. And the MoBs that actually walk the wall and end up in the SW corner.<br><br>North to South Patrol: Scarelings, Shiverbacks, Spinechillers - Scares are imps - minature ones ... and beleive you me - they have THE aggro radius in Fear (next to Gorgons it seems). They fly faster than Jboots - and with 50+ sow you can barely keep ahead of em. The nasty thing about scares is they are hard to target ... and tanks - especially the primary - can have a hard time finding it once mez is broke - as they like to fly around and get sitters and the chanter that mezzed it. Another nasty thing about these guys is that they Backstab for 440. And to top it all off they proc shadow step - so one minute you are in camp ... the next - you don't know where you are at. If you are NOT familiar with Fear - or if you get ported to a place where you are aggroed (especially on the break) - get your loc and die. Do not train the camp with more mobs (esp on the break). If you are familiar ... then get your bearings and head back to camp (but please make sure you are not bringing more baddies). One Bad case of this - and bless his soul - a warrior got ported near the Fetid House ... he DID NOT try to come back - but it aggroed him - and after killing him ... they aggroed the camp - since they were have the distance at this point. These are some of the first ones you wanna take out. One last note - when you get an add with them - try your best to say what part of camp they are in - cause they come in fast - and get in the middle of the peeps ... and usually several are hit - and one might go down before assist is called or mez is laid. They drop the rogue rapier.<br><br>Shiverbacks: Big Apes ... they proc some kind of freeze thing - though in the countless times - I have not seen an icon that you get when a Spinechiller Spider gets you. The are big and mean - and hit like the rest of the mobs - about in the 135 range. The can be intemidating - must be the breathing or the screaching they do but in the end - they are pretty easy for chanters to mez and easy to target. Only once have I seen a pop where 90% of the west wall were apes - and man o man - there seemed to be more mobs that day ... (was a day that IF had to bail the raid out - and I told Gratiano there were tons of apes ... and he was like - apes - no worries - but when he was in the zone - he stated - my god i have never seen so many apes). Respect them - but they are pretty easy compared. Monk Gear drops off these.<br><br>Spinechiller Spiders - I can never feel safe in Everfrost after seeing these. Fast, fuzzy, white spiders ... that have a freeze kinda dot. Once again ... one of the easier MoBs in fear - seem to be mezzed easy - and they are easy to target due to their bright white. Respect the spids though ... they add fast and are quick - and any lack of respect will have you dead. They drop Cryosilk Armor.<br><br>One quick Note Before I go on ... when Incomming is called by the puller - you better stand up - cause the MoBs go after all that are sitting - and peeps die fast if not careful ... and WORSE is pet classes - so Jobober gets pissed at mr scare - and Owner doesnt know it - cause he/she is just worried about living - and enchanter_01 can't mez the mob cause it is going buck.<br><br>East to West - North of Portal: Same as the North to South - but on occasion there can be some Fetid Fiend roamers or a Worry Wraith. Really rare is a toad that might be a hair bit to far north and in the roam pattern - and once I seen a frightfinger on the west wall ... i am assuming on the roam pattern from the east.<br><br>Fetid Fiends: Giant Zombies. Nasty disease - lasts for hours. Look exactly like the male and female zombies from common zones. Hit like a plane mob - seem to mez easy. One note on them - is that they are SLOW. You can out run these guys easy ... and loose them on the chase. That means - you have to milk them in on the pull. Directly North of West Camp is the Fetid Fiend House (cause there are usually several in there) and if your break team isn't tight - and someone wanders too far North - yep - you will get the house on ya to. The males drop Pally Armor and the Females drop the Cleric Belt.<br><br>Worry Wraith: Giant Willowisps. They are enchaters and have pets. These are harder to mez ... and should be noted at the top of the assist list when taking mobs. Assign someone before the raid to take the pets out solo (Skandranon does such a nice job of this) or get the annoyance mezzed. They can charm ... *remembers when Alnaron was charmed once* and they can Fear. Most of the time - they are casting the anarchy line or the choke line. A lot of tanks say these are a pain in the butt to target and follow also ... so please note the respect on these mobs. Funny thing pulling them - is I have to usually hit the stupid thing (yes - with my 1/25 1hb) to get it to come after me (any monks of others have the same experience with these guys?) Not always true though - cause when I train mobs on the break - and maybe it is because of mass aggro - I usually pick one up - from the Fetid Fiend house. The drop Wraithstone ... which is for Necro research from the 3 sisters in Foriegn Quarter ... LAME - DESTROY. (Note - all the words you need drop ... if a necro really wants to do it - more power to him/her - other than that ... worthless)<br><br>East to West - South Wall: Includes all the above - but mainly Fetid Fiends and Amy Warriors (can be a knight). Sometimes apes are on this pattern.<br><br>Amygdalan Warriors: Giant huminoid creatures with a squid type face. One of the hardest to mez period - next to the Knights. Make sure these are at the top of the mobs to pick from list. Hit hard and are mean. Nothing much else to say here. They drop the Warrior Whip (Bard Epic) and or the Warrior Shield. If you get several of these it can be a big fight ... but with good chanters ... no problems.<br><br>Turmoil Toads: These are not so much part of the E-W South patrol ... but can be right over the hill to the east at the begining of the Grave Yard - and can add on break especially if someones invis breaks on the hill and one is sitting at the bottom to the east. These things are another nasty mob. Small tiny cousins to Lower Guk - they are hard to see make the Frenzy look like a wuss. Their Favorite thing to do - is FEAR. Please do not have sow on and please have walk if possible ... even like this - their fear can send you up and over the hill and into the graveyard. If this happens to you ... and you are aggroed ... get a loc and die - do not bring back more mobs to the camp. If not aggroed ... and you know your way back to camp - please do so carefully - ensuring that you are not bringing more mobs. If you don't know the way to camp ... and are still alive - just stand there and get your loc - and someone (or something) will eventually get you. These aren't the hardest to mez - but are about medium to medium high. ALWAYS listen to your CHANTERS on which next to take - but I would assume Amys and WW before toads ... and toads before apes - FF - and spiders. Toads drop the Shamman Belt.<br><br>So what does the average West Wall break consist of: Hmmm ... let me close my eyes ... and picture this ... 5 apes easy ... about 4 spiders ... 5 scarelings ... 1-2 fetid fiends (usually adds) ... an Amy Warrior ... and maybe a toad or a WW. You should expect that ... if not more depending on adds and how people get to the camp ... how tight the break group stays together at camp (yes ... people wander as far as the FF house and the SW corner - it happens). That is about 18 mobs ... on average you are looking at before you can sit back a breath. As I type these numbers down ... I think about the times I have seen the one roamer behind the portal ... the 2 roamers on the south wall that go to the SW corner ... I think of the spid/scare/ape that comes up to the portal ... I think of the couple that stop at the bottom of the hill ... I think of the couple apes/spids/scares that roam N to S on the West wall ... and I think ... that if you were really good ... perhaps the break would be more like 10 mobs ... if you stayed tight and knew what you were doing. Of course you still have some stuff afterwards ... cause the other roamers would be out there ... but I have yet to see this kind of break.<br><br>So if doing a West Wall break ... go in invis ... make sure to turn 90 degrees LEFT that means &lt;--------THIS WAY ... and go down the hill to the wall and stop at the wall between the 2 trees. DO NOT go too far north and DO NOT go too far south. Stay Tight and Frosty and Focus on the assist calls. KEEP the CHANTERS alive at all costs. YES - their life is more important than yours at this time. Evacers don't go below evac mana. If evac is called - get close to your evacer and keep them alive.<br><br>STAY FROSTY!!!!!<br><br><br><br>Plane of Fear 1.0.4 - Begining The Pulls ...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> This Assumes that you have broken the West Wall and that you are going to pull North First<br><br>MoB Placement:<br>MOST MoBs in Fear are Roamer types. They don't roam the whole plane but a certain section of that plane. IE: The West wall ... North to South roamers on the wall, the South Patrol that Roams East to West on the South Wall. The ONLY place that does not have a roam pattern is North of the Fire Wall (the Amy Temple). If you think of Fear in the 4 corners ... things split up nicely and it will begin to give you a basic grid of the MoB layout. Note - that the MoB layout is slightly different than just 4 corners of different MoBs - but this concept will help you grasp the layout of Fear to a degree.<br><br>In Reality a lot of MoBs are set up around specific landmarks. The Following map is one of my favorites:<br>www.eqmaps.com/mapz/fearplane2.jpg<br>It is not graphically pretty - but it is detailed - and the one I had to use when dragging 20 bodies to the North Camp once.<br><br>So ... lets break it down like this ... North West Corner, Fetid Fiend House, West Wall, Graveyard, Yellow Tower and Boogy House (Includes the Sammy Building too), South East Corner, Frightfinger House, then the NE corner (not exactly corner - but close enough) which has the Glare Lords, Phoboplasm, and Nightmares, and last but not the least is the Amy Temple.<br><br>Pulls are generally around these areas. There are some things to note when Cazic is up. When pulling Draco - or any of the Demigods (Fright - Terror - Dread) you are basically aggroing a 'PET' of Cazic Thule. When that happens - a) the person who attacked the mob first gets DT (that INCLUDES an ENCHANTER that tries to mez it /snicker) b) all the other PETS (Demis) will start to head to your area - bringing with them a train of MoBs as they procede. So if you are going to do Draco ... make sure that you take him in time - loot the goodies (that are not no drop) and camp. Note - that ever 45 seconds Cazic will be DTing someone. Tell people to get over their really cool sig and camp. With Demis - have chanters mez the 2 Amy Knights - and kill teh demi quickly - and camp ... leave a Necro, Monk, or SK feigned at camp - to ensure that everyone is out or killed and they can /q out and come to chat and let you know that it is clear to go back in. Why? Cause some sk, necro, or monks FD and go afk - and they are in an agitated environment - and when peeps log back in - and they stand up - you will have the DT starting again.<br><br>More on that later ... but for now ...<br><br>I am sure other peeps have a different method to this - and any correction or addition would be more than welcomed.<br><br>Starting Pulls<br>West Wall is broke - rezzes are done - mana is good. Start North. I will tell you this about the aggro here in Fear - it is FREAKIN HUGE. If you think you are going to run up and judo chop a mob - chances are - you will aggro about 5 behind it. Best way to pull - imo - is to run a little - listen (if you have sound) - watch carefully for movement - and move more - soon you will see about 1-3 things coming at ya in full force and you will have your pull. Once you know the patterns - you will kinda know where to look for stuff to pick it. I guess my big secret is my sound blaster live - and the fact that I have 2 subwoofers - 1 in front and 1 in back - and 4 speakers in front and 4 in back ... I really feel like I am in a jungle of sorts in Fear.<br><br>To the North you will have the Fetid House - the North West Corner - the Tenticle Terror Bridge - and the Graveyard (though I am thinkin that maybe pulling the Graveyard around to the south would be easier in some regards - more on that in pathing).<br><br>Fetid House:<br><br>In this house directly north of camp ... usually 4-5 mobs. Usually all but one is a Fetid Fiend ... the other can be another mob - and lately have been things like WW (Worry Wraiths). If you want a smoother pull - you will need someone to peel ... as you are going to pull the house. Guinn mentioned something to me about levels and aggro radius ... and I know this to be true for lower level mobs - so I am thinking - that the higher the level - probably the less extra you will pull ... as only the mobs closest to you will pull.<br><br>Pulling buildings is pretty much the same. I would assume that you have a couple chanters - and 5 mobs should not be hard. However - in the midst of confussion - these pulls that are usually controlable can result in hurt if peeps are not on their toes.<br><br>So ... work your way to the house ... and they will come a runnin. You can FD outside of camp - far enough for chanters who are up front to mez em - and have the primary pick em like apples of a tree. Some of my first mistakes as a necro puller would be like running a mob into camp - bad idea (I see it still happen with monks even though) - or feign too close to camp (which I am still working on) but if you get it right - and work with your chanters ... you can have stuff outside the camp for the primary to pull.<br><br>This is mainly with house or landmark pulls ... the roamers if you watch them ... you can get in onsies ... or twosies at the worse - no big deal. (Make sure you milk stuff in - cause pathing around the GY SUX - and you will get adds - more on that later)<br><br>Once you get the house cleared ... your next objective will be the NW corner ... finish up them spids - apes and scares. NOTE - as you are pulling from the north - try to stay WEST - near the wall ... as the TT (Tenticle Terrors) are close by - just east of the FF house. Be on the lookout of the roamers from the GY to the East that come over to the Fetid House - and remember when pulling back to camp - to watch for these possible adds.<br><br>NorthWest Corner - extends north past the Fetid House to the North wall and from the West side of the fire wall to the West Wall. Mainly up in this area you have Scares, Spids, and Apes. Take your time and grab em 1 or 2 at a time ... bring em in ... you can keep a pretty healthy pace up and in reality - after the break - there shouldn't be a lot up here. NOTE: Don't go in through the fire - the Amys knights in the temple will aggro - and HT you - and IF you manage to survive (like say only 4 HT get you instead of 7-8 ) and you freak and run back to camp - chances are you will wipe out the team with a bunch of the temple. Keep to the corner - and pull the temple last (imo - some peeps don't pull the temple at all).<br><br>OK ... FF House and NW corner done ... breathe and get ready for the TTs.<br><br>Tenticle Terrors:<br>Pathing: Note that this bridge and the one in the east are pains in the butt. Yes - stuff can come through it ... but you practicly have to stand there and let it eat you. One move away from the center ... and they will generally path back - and do some weird crap - and head south - and grab some friends from the GY ... and you will see all kinds of stuff just aggroing around in teh GY - and you will be thinking to yourself 'Hmm - I better not tell anybody'.<br><br>A cool thing is though - you can get outside of the pull/aggro range - and stuff will leave you alone. So it is possible to have the whole GY aggro on you - yet bring in onsies - twosies.<br><br>The best pathing to pull stuff is to the NORTH of the bridge or to the SOUTH of the bridge - DO NOT PULL THROUGH THE BRIDGE.<br><br>The inital TTs come easy ... only 1 or 2 will be boogers. But your pull will probably be around 4-5 TTs. NOTE - These guys DISPELL and love to use that Force Shock spell that throws you literally across the zone. If your sow is dispelled - you know to bend over and kiss it goodbye for the most part (or FD and call for your friend to come peel)<br><br>Some more notes on TTs. In the old days - we would just do em. I mean - tanks up front - loose buffs and swing away - and not rebuff until they were all dead. What a hard way to do this. Pimm suggested something he seen Seven Dreams do (I believe this is right - please Pimm help me to honor the right peeps) - and that was to Snare and Fear em - and fear kite them. The buffs stay up - and the mobs die quick.<br><br>If you don't do this here are some problems:<br>A) Pets - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PETS TO BE DEAD HERE. Them dang things Dispell and pets go buck - you have 4 TTs dispelling - you got 4 different pets on different mobs - the chanters are trying to mez - and the pets are breaking it - you are calming your pet down - but dispell goes off from another - and dispells mez from the one that the chatner just mezzed - it cast dispell and you pet is buck again and you got a whirlwind of Mez - dispell - pissed off pets. KILL YOUR DAMN PETS - cause a chanters life is worth more than 2 bone chips or some stone. NOTE - this goes for Frightfingers with their Grav Flux - and Glare Lords (evil eyes looking things) that dispell as well.<br><br>B) Have the chanters out front ... with the Primary - tanks behind them - and casters in the back. Get ALL TTs mezzed. Then go from Left to Right - Snare and Fear the first one. Have a designated SNARER that calls it out ... and a designated FEARER that calls it out. Once the TT is Snared and Feared - have primary break mez - and let the fight continue - and Mr Fear person (generally a necro) keep it feared. This will ensure a nice clean fight - with buffs up and clerics and chanters not wasting mana.<br><br>Continue this pattern until all TTs have been pulled and the bridge is cleared. Note - there has been like 1 roamer in the GY and usually there is always 1 TT in the temple ... so if the rangers are screaming - there is one more - let them know that the bridge is cleared ... and you will get to it when you do.<br><br>Grave Yard:<br>Ok - Note - this does not mean you pull the Gorgon roost - which sits on the east side of the GY. This is mainly to clear the first few mobs. The rest of the GY can be pulled from the south - and lead stuff south and around the hill to the west wall camp (but you will prob pull the Yellow Tower - Boogy House - and the WW Tower(what I call the Sammy house - cause more sammys than WW)<br><br>Pathing: Once again ... pathing is jacked. There is no real way to describe each hill or dip ... each obsticle ... cause the mobs go this way and that way through the GY. The middle ain't so bad as the edges - especially around the bridges ... but you got to see it to understand. Just take your time ... and don't run too too fast - in case it back paths and aggros more ... milk stuff in and around.<br><br>What is in GY - Toads - WW - Fetid Fiends - Amy Wars and Knights - Samhains (giant pumpkin head scarecrows) - and Gorgons - maybe a Boogyman or 2 (though they would be more east) maybe a TT or a frightfinger - maybe a glarelord (though not likely) some scares in the roam pattern. Lotta random stuff.<br><br>Gorgons: These are the giant harypies. The things druids drool over. NOTE THIS - they have this uber stun. Make sure your RM gear is on and that RM is up. If they get their stun off on you - you will be almost if not dead by the time it wears off. They fly fast - don't worry about loosing them - they are on ya. These drop druid armor.<br><br>Samhains: Giant scarecrow - undead - I am pretty sure you can outrun these boogers ... drop Flux Axe for Rangers and Scare Straw - Necro research quest (LAME - the words drop already - but more power to the necro that wants to do the quest.)<br><br><br><br>Fear 1.0.5 - Moving East ...<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>This assumes the NW - the Fetid Fiend House - and the TT's are clear - and maybe a little from the graveyard<br><br>OK - If Dracoliche is up - you as a puller have probably seen him marching around the graveyard with his pet. Dracoliche might look like a bone dragon - but it is NOT undead - and you can not use undead DD against him. It does see through invis and will aggro you and chase you. I will talk more about Dracho later.<br><br>Please inform everyone - especially your chanters that pulls will be coming from the south. You will now be pulling around the south of portal hill.<br><br>South and Heading East:<br>You have the south patrol - that moves - East to West and ends up in the SW corner (which could have been taken during the break - or during an early pull). There is a MoB that walks up the back side of the hil in an angle that is usually an Amy or a Fetid Fiend. Can be an ape - but that is more rare - as most Apes are West Wall only. There is usually 1 - 2 mobs that walk down into the SW corner. Once again - Amy and Fetids for the most part. As you are clearing the SW corner and around portal hill - there is a chance of pulling maybe a toad or a WW from the SW corner of the GY. Make sure to just look around and aggro all the little stuff between the hill and the tower first to prevent cross pulls.<br><br>The Yellow Tower: A.K.A. Scare tower - since usually there are 4-5 mobs inside - mainly scares ... (usually looks like 4 scares and maybe a WW or Fetid maybe even a frightfinger). NOTE - this applies for most landmark - building pulls - YOU WILL GET THEM ALL (unless level truly has something to do with it). Now is a good time for a peeler - but then again ... if your raid has 3 chanters - they are probably bored right now. Gague your chanters and what they can and can not handle - the fact is - IF YOU HAVE BROKE - you are in pretty decent hands - IF SOMEONE BAILED YOU OUT, but the raid is continuing - you might want to consider smaller pulls. For the love of God - have SoW up - cause these Scares - as noted before - will fly faster than Jboots - and eat through your Rune - and start hitting you - and with your back to them - you very well could get backstabbed a couple times for 440 and or ported. (Which can be a very bad thing - though on occasion it has saved my life as well ... as I was ported in the right direction and able to FD - but why risk it)<br><br>Clear up any roamers between here and the Boogey House - as that will be your next pull. This means snagging some stuff from the GY between the portal and the Boogey House ... be mindful young bedouin ... of your distance next to the house when pulling things ... as the aggro is huge. Note - you might have to do several pulls on this one and clean up some of the south GY.<br><br>Boogeyman House: Once again 4-5 mobs ... Mainly Boogeys ... maybe a Fetid - Sammy - or even a fright finger. Same drill ... by now you should be getting the hang of it - or if you are a pro ... you are getting 'very sleepy' at reading me type this over and over.<br><br>After Boogeys are pulled ... clear up any random mobs between boogey house/yellow tower and the WW Tower.<br><br>WW Tower: (Dang it - there are more Sammies here than WW) Nother house pull. Mainly Samhians - usually 2 - and then about 2 frightfingers - maybe a boogey or a WW or 2 - ... 4-5 mobs total.<br><br>Dracoliche: IF Draco is up - then continue reading (well - yes - you can read anyways) - if NOT - then you may skip to the Graveyard section.<br><br>At this time ... from the south - circle around the hill and begind pulling the onsies twosies ... making a path to Draco. Note - you can practicly pull the whole GY as Draco roams North to South and East to West ... but once enough of the GY is pulled - and you are ready for Draco - tell everyone to get ready.<br><br>Dracho is like a normal prekunark dragon fight. Debuff and get 4 fakes up (please no water breathing from high lvl peeps as DMF will proabably be applied later and things like that keep it from sticking) Fakes ... can be Ultravision - Resist Fire - Resist Cold - and something else - I think Kinsleyer had cast See Invis (which DMF does) but he was lower level and my DMF stuck. Make sure Resist Disease and Resist Magic are LAST.<br><br>NOTE - Dracholiche's main attack is Disease Based. I did not see a poison one go off the one time I did fight it - but it is a Necro type mob - has a pet - and I would assume a poison based DoT. The whole time I was pulling it - it was trying to Shock of Poison it looked like - which is a DD poison attack and I kept resisting Scourge (39 Necro Spell) . It kinda casts like Cynderella (sp) outside Fear portal (I mean the same types of spells she tries to do)<br><br>Scourge<br>Adding 4 Disease counters<br>DoT for 504 Hit Points (HP) in 21 ticks<br>Decrease Current Hitpoints by 40 (L34)<br><br>I have heard that his AoE is the Following - though I didn't get it stuck on me ...<br><br>Rotting Flesh<br>Adding 9 Disease counters<br>DoT for 800 Hit Points (HP) in 8 ticks<br>Increase Current Hitpoints by 100 (L1)<br><br>It does have the AoE Fear - so make sure walk is on.<br><br>Straight up pre-kunark dragon fight. One thing about when to do what - Pimm suggested a 100% pets and melee - and at 75% casters - which isn't along the lines of a Naggy fight - and it worked swell. You have to be in Melee range to cast - and it IS NOT UNDEAD. So if you are a Necro - not twitching - you gotta be siphoning.<br><br>One other thing to note is this (ONLY APPLIES IF CT IS UP ALSO) ... you have a limited ammount of time once the first person is DTed. You see - Draco - and the Demis - Dread, Terror, and Fright - are PETS of CT. When you aggro it - not so much by it getting you on it's hate list - but the first tank to HIT it will be DTed by CT. DTs will continue every 45 seconds. On top of that - the Demis - with their Amy Kights ... will begin their journey towards you - bringing other friends as they come. YOU GOTTA BE SERIOUS AND TAKE DRACO FAST. If not - you will get jumped and it will be nasty.<br><br>So having loot prerolled is a good thing - though items like the Bone Clasp Girdle and Stasff of Undead Leagions are tradable. Have the Group leader - or someone that is left in the group - loot the tradable items - and camp to chat after it is dead. In fact as soon as the battle is over - have your designated monk - sk - necro - FD and make sure everyoen camps or is killed and that camp is clear before they /q and get peeps outa chat.<br><br>OK - so you are ready to pull it. NOTE - it does see through invis. So go around the south and up into the GY and find him. Make sure no mobs are around (which you should have cleared enough that you can grab it). Get close and it will aggro and chase you ... casting it's spells ... milk it in and around and walla - Dragon Fight.<br><br>For each of the Demis - you will be camping to chat as well IF CT is up. Same drill for each one.<br><br>The Graveyard: Now - you can pick and clean out the mobs here before you get Dracho ... but you generally will have some mobs left and will be cleaning them up. Let me define the Graveyard. It is everything NORTH of the Boogeyhouse to the Amytemple (firewall) and Everything EAST of the TT Bridge to the Gorgon Roost.<br><br>This is easy - especially cause you will be pulling it south ... and wont have as bad pathing as if you were pulling around the bridges - but RESPECT the graveyard. The pathing is not uber good - and you can have path backs - and adds cause of it ... it is about milking ... and getting certain landscape features that you know path well for mobs to pull through or around. Onsies - Twosies. Note - you don't have to pull all the way to the Gorg Roost ... you will be getting that from the next camp.<br><br>South East Corner: At this point you can let everyone know you are going to be moving soon. Tell them to be patient as the next couple pulls will be long ... BUT if you wanted to just move them - the fight will look something like the break ... with multiple adds and is risky imo - but if you are bored and up for a little excitement you can move them a hair bit early and fight along the way.<br><br>Past the WW tower ... is the SE corner - and what you will pull here is the EAST PATROL. That is - the mobs that Roam the East wall - North to South patterns. Includes ... Gorgons - Boogeymen - Frightfingers - Glare Lords - and maybe a WW or 2. Pull em in - and continue to check out the area - making sure that it is safe to move people. You should only have about 6-7 pulls before you move. Loc of new camp is approx n1200 n800. Clear the way - and move the people there. Make sure they follow you and stay along the south wall. The camp looks like a clearing that is flat with 2 trees spaced apart on teh south wall heading east to west - and a large tree just before a small dip. (Like that is really going to help).<br> <p><hr><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=12503>Arris Dragonborne</a><BR>52nd <a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon>Cavalier</a> of Mithanniel Marr<BR>Of the <a href=http://www.lanys.com>Lanys T'Vyl</a> Server<br>Member of the <a href=http://cot.appsware.com>Circle of Truth</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A> at: 2/14/02 1:57:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhawktel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hawktel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/25/00 11:20:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tacticus Fearus Breakus</span><hr size=1> This should be added to the Tome of Knowledge.
