<br>
Many have heard and many have wondered after this bazaar tale of brothers, after much ado, i've taken the time to write it all down as best as i can remember it the way it was told to me, so many years ago now, when i lived in surefall glade a young druid myself. <br>
<br>
Let us begin, well at the beginning, Long ago when a small tadfry was hatched to the murky waters of cabilis there was much celebration in the house of Twitchtail. A second son was born! A son that would save the family name! He would be called Ghoda &quot;Dragon&quot; Twichtail. He would be a monk!<br>
Ghoda's family was very proud of him, they doted on him constantly, they taught him young the responsibility of the Iksar clan. They told him all the old legends and the grandmasters treated him as their own. He knew nothing but happiness.<br>
But this happiness could not last.<br>
A shadow was lurking on the edges of his mothers eyes. the boy would have to be told...someday...but not today.<br>
Years passed, the fry grew to a young monk just trying out his skills. It was then that time caught up with him, for life is never as patient as a parent. The other iksar children whispered behind his back, they refused to play with him, they called him names! The boy could not understand. He'd known nothing but kindness!<br>
That night, with the threat of tears welling in his eyes, Ghoda approached his mother with the hardest of questions, &quot;Why?&quot; he asked her.<br>
She knew it was time &quot;come sit down my boy, i'll tell you the tale of bob.&quot; she said.<br>
Long into the night they talked of a time before Ghoda was born. Of a time when Bob was still around. You see Bob was Ghoda's older brother who had left upon the arrival of the second son. He'd left in disgrace. Bob was a gentle iksar, much to the chagrin of his relatives, he dreamed of travel, of adventure, of far off places where the landscapes could freeze your scales, or boil your blood. He hates all things to do with Necromancy, or the other dark arts so prevalent to his people, and he had not the skill to become a monk. No, what Bob wanted was to be a ranger! He'd gone to the half elf, that &quot;vile&quot; creature that lurked outside of his city day and night by the old ruins of kaesora. He'd listened to the tales the old ranger had to tell. That was the life he wanted to find. That was the skill he wanted to master. <br>
And so it was, to the utter horror of his family, he announced he would leave with the hatching of the next brood. He would shame his family no more with his presence, he would be gone from them. Dead to them if they so chose, but never would he come back unless called.<br>
So that was why so much rested on the back of this young iksar. so many generations of pride and blood ties. He had to make up for the supposed failings of one.<br>
The pain ghoda's mother felt at failing her first born was palatable, and ghoda vowed to her then and there that he would go out into the world when he was able, he would call his brother home, or he would die trying.<br>
The years passed by, quickly at first and then more slowly it seemed.  The boy grew into a master and grand adventures were had on all corners of the world. <br>
Many a story could be heard about a strange traveler, who went by no name, and while he carried a bow, and knew the arts of a ranger, there was something not quite right about him, a lilt to his voice a darkness in his shadow...something out of place wherever he went. Some whispered he was a changeling, a dark elf half born, half elfs never could keep their lineages clean, it would be like them to create such an abomination. If only they had known the truth of it!<br>
Ghoda followed these rumors and over exaderated stories, bards tales, and drunken dwarf confessions with a passion few could match.<br>
this is how ghoda learned of his brothers great skill with the bow and gentle ranger magics, how he'd been all the places he'd dreamed, the far north and burning desserts of the south. Rumors had even said he'd been welcomed at the table of Cazic Thule and Tunare alike!<br>
Ghodas travels and the stories took him as far north as Halas to the caves of Lady Vox, and as far south as Velious where the ice dwarfs brew a fierce ale, and all are welcome at their door. And everywhere one thing was always sure to be uttered, &quot;Bob! Is that you Bob?&quot; but alas, none have stood up to the call of this younger brother, perhaps no one ever will.<br>
Tirelessly, endlessly, fruitlessly, the search goes on, and maybe just maybe, time will see fit to cross the path of these two brothers, that blood might recognize blood, and together they may go home.<br>
<br>
Now that you know the tale of Bob, do not wonder after the young iksar who goes about calling his name in the shadows of our worlds grimest habitats or most pristeen wildernesses. Simply wish him well upon his quest that he may someday go home again.<br>
