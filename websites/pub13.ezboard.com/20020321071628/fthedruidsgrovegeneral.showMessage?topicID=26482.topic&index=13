Point systems are nice, but don't lend themself to &quot;Need before Greed&quot;.   Someone with the most points can get something, rather than a person who could &quot;use it most&quot;.   And if you put restrictions on the point system like &quot;You can roll/bid on things you want with points... but not if someone else needs it more&quot; then you truly don't have a points system... because guarenteed, &quot;Bob&quot; will have tons of points, and something he really wants will drop, and then if he's told &quot;Jane can use it better, you can't roll (or even shouldn't roll)&quot; ... one of Bobs easy responses is &quot;I've earned all these points, I have a right to use them&quot;.  <br>

It's used by one of the guilds FE is allied with.  They take into consideration things like who needs the item the most, loot participation (did you come and do nothing?), attendance (including especially times not late).  I like that system because I know the folks who are committed to their raids will get stuff and not folks who showed up for their first raid.<br>
<br>
My guild uses straight random (can and will use) most of the time, but I do not think that is a fair system.  I'd give examples of problems, but some folks in my guild may read this board ;) <p><Font Size = 1>

<br>
We roll on normal armor items not BP or Leg items, and other decent loot... anything that is a BP, Legs, or considered "Uber" (we usually consider uber something that we can not necisarily go back and get all the time, maybe not everyone considers it uber, but pretty much everything off of rare mobs such as velks, dragons, ssra temple bosses, etc. is awarded...)<br>
<br>
The way we award things?  honestly I can't say caus I am not an officer, but it seems like they go by the following categories<br>
<br>
Participation<br>
Overall Time Spent Raiding<br>
If they help others no matter what<br>
If they sit in seb while we are raiding<br>
Main/Alt<br>
Etc.<br>
<br>
-Participation is one of the largest factors, we generally consider someone that spends every moment they play EQ raiding or with the guild much more valuable then someone who spends a LOT more time on EQ buut only spends maybe 1/2 of it with the guild at hunts, and misses some (even if they hunts they are on outnumber the amount of time the other person has spent)<br>
-Also it is frowned upon if it seems you are going to raids that benefit yourself, IE Velks raid comes up, every caster in the guild runs to velks to get their special item, but then we decide to do vindi, and many of the same people refuse to come, either they just say they are in a group and can't leave, or they don't log on all together and make up some stupid excuse all the time... If the caster always shows up to fear, but never hate (if they get their items from fear, and vice versa)<br>
-One of the worst things I consider is when a member sits in seb, or wherever else getting EXP while we are raiding... I don't know if this is as much of an issue to the loot distrubuters as myself, but I can't stand it.  If I was doing loot, and I assume they do it the same way, they will generally type name filters while we are at raids, and if they see the same name exping while we are raiding over and over, they, hopefully, put them further down the list of people for loot<br>
-Last thing is obviously a main/alt... rarely do we give uber items to an alt over a main... but it has happened before... these situations come up when the alt, is really played as much as the main, and say a 55 cleric, and they chose to play them to help the guild, rather then play their 60 necro, or something... or play both... anyways, these people will get preference over people that never show up, or appear to be a flight risk (leaving the guild soon), or sit in seb exping.  <br>
<br>
Generally Moonhawk, our guildleader, will ask over GC who wants the item, then set those things up against each other, and we all trust that he will make a good decision on who gets it.  If he is not at the hunt generally 2-3 officers that are at the hunt decide...<br>
<br>
Hope that Helped<br>

From I read your guild was like mine in the beginning. We were small, close knit, but couldn't do much more than the planes (lvl avg was around 50). Random worked fine. When we all started getting serious about lvling up and tackling bigger things, we moved to a half random half award system. Basically, the rare items (bp's and epic parts for example) were awarded, everything else was randomed. This took a lot of adjustment for most people and at the same time we became allied with 2 other guilds which made it all the more complicated. Some people thought everything should be randomed but most thought everything should be awarded. It worked out ok, since we were still growing, gaining lvl's and strength.  But, after a while, loot issues started getting in the way of our alliance so the guild leaders sat down, discussed it and decided that from then on everything would be awarded by whoever was leading the raid at the time. This, ultimatly caused the biggest problem. Since we were dealing with 3 guilds, it was hard for one person to make a fair judgement. Afterall, how do they know what someone might deserve if they only see them once in a while rather than seeing you own guild mates on a constant basis (if that makes sense). Finally, we turned to a loot council. One person from each guild (we now have 4 in the alliance) is on the loot council with the raid leader breaking any ties. LC changes from raid to raid sometimes just to make sure we stay unbiased. However, only those that come to almost every raid and have shown themselves to have good judgement are picked to be on LC. My guild is in charge of keeping the loot list for each month and posts it up for everyone to see. This helps people make fair decisions. It's not perfect, but it works for us and it's relatively low maintenance. <br>
<br>
The whole thing may sound corny, but just wanted to give you some insight on how things might go for you when you start to change loot policies. Like I said, it all depends on what your guild has coming in loot wise, how many people are involved and what you are able to accomplish. Best of luck to you, this topic is *always* a hard one. And if you are going to be the one deciding on loot all the time be prepared to be scrutinzed at every turn. You can never make everyone happy and some people will always disagree with your decisions, but things always tend to wash out in the end. Just be sure to stay open to suggestions and constructive critisism. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=26482.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=26482.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26482.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~msippel/thedruidsgrove/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=26482.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=26482.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26482.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26482.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
