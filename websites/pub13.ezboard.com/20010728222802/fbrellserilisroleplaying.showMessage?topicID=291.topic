Get it?  A necromancer!   He raises the dead and does nasty things to people’s graves.  He is not someone you invite to spend the evening with.  Necromancer?  Hello?  Did someone cast a silence spell?”<br>
        “Be quiet Lishan, and let me think,” said Mcconnall rubbing his chin.<br>
        “By the gods, a barbarian thinking.., now were all doomed,” <br>
        “Damn the gods!  WE have to get ourselves out of this.  A necro stands in our way to the exit, and we have to get that key off his pet.”<br>
        “I know!  LETS PORT OUT!”, Lishan said sarcastically.  “This whole najena/dungeon thing can kiss my wizard arse!”<br>
        “Lishan, If you don’t be silent, your gonna have to start casting spells out your mouth, cause I’m gonna shove that staff so far up your..,”<br>
“Boy’s!” interrupted Aingel.  “Lets all calm down and try to figure a way out of this dungeon rather then squabble among ourselves.”<br>
        “As you wish my love.” Mcconnall said bowing deeply, as Lishan made mocking faces behind the massive warrior.  “I just can not think with all his babbling”<br>
        “Well, while you two plan on an alternative to this affair, would it hurt if I sat in the room there?” Lishan asked.<br>
        Mcconnall looked at his maps alongside Aingel and grunted approval.  <br>
        “O.K.…, your sure right?  It will be safe to sit over there eh?”<br>
        Mcconnall waved his hand at Lishan and returned to his map studies.  Scratching his head, Lishan slipped quietly into the next room.  The place had a gloomy, blue feel to it’s stone like damp walls.  A chill air ran through the passages that was surely going to make him sick if he did not retreat soon.  Dungeons were murder on the sinuses for one who did nothing more then study the books of magic all his life.  Maybe Aingel, being an elf and a druid knew some kind of remedy for all that.<br>
        The room was poorly lit as he walked over to the only visible wall and sat down to rest.  He pulled from his back pack a muffin to eat only to find it was slightly molded.  Tossing it to the side, the muffin rebounded on something unseen in the dark.  A snarl resounded in the room.<br>
        Not good.<br>
        Something began moving in the darkness.  A clatter that sounded like a pile of rocks clicking in reverse erupted beside him.  Lishan stood and stared into the darkness cursing his human eyes. He swallowed.  Taking his hands, Lishan brought both forefingers together and began pulling from the weave that existed before time.  Through the flickers of his spell casting he could dimly see shapes moving all around him.  His heart pounded upon his chest as he realized that he was surrounded.  Bending the magic to his will, his eyes soon took on a dim red glow as he slowly granted himself the ability to see in darkness.  <br>
He dropped his staff..,<br>
     Four Skeletons and an ogre stood snarling.  The skeletons stood man sized all but one, who in turn was obviously from some long dead halfling.  Their eyes too glowed a blood, red eerie visage, while they all stared with an eternal macabre grin from lack of lips.  The ogre rose to his feet a good 9 feet tall and grinned as well.   He looked hungry.<br>
     “Heh.” Lishan smiled childishly,  “Ration?”  He held out a strip of jerky.<br>
<br>
     The first shot rebounded off the wall loudly, but not as loud as Lishan’s yell for help.  The army of the dead jumped forward and swung their blades at him.  The first shot missed Lishan’s stomach by inches as he spun to his left, and the third and forth sliced out and caught naught but air.  The forth tore into Lishan on the robe and pinned it to the wall ripping it as he fell to his side.  From the floor Lishan summoned the weave.  He unleashed a spell in the room, a globe of icy winds that would have burned the flesh from a common man.  However, the skeletons had no flesh, and the other was no man.  Without missing a beat, he rolled over his shoulder, but cursed himself for doing so, for now he had placed them between him and the others.  <br>
     “Uh.., a little help in here would be good.”<br>
     The ogre smiled a snotty grin, and raised his sword for the kill.  All around him skeletons crowded closer to assist in the massacre.  His back was against the wall.  His mind rushed to formulate the motions for his favorite spell.<br>
     Suddenly there was a flash of steel and light.  The ogre stumbled forward underneath barbarian steel, as one of  skeletons was incinerated by elven tree magic.  Turning,  Lishan slid his head just in time as another skeleton’s blade clanged the now bare wall.  The last skeleton turned and drove his blade toward Mcconnall’s exposed side, but it was his undoing, for the barbarian had learned many years as a youth the value of feints and feigned weaknesses.   As soon as the skeleton’s blade was laid low, the barbarian brought his blade upwards with a blinding speed and this dead was finally laid to rest.  <br>
Aingel slid behind the barbarian’s onslaught and let loose a spell to finish off the remaining skeletons.  The ogre fell backwards clutching his now bleeding chest.  Mcconnall stayed on him determined to finish him off.  Lishan wondered if the man delighted in killing.  Suddenly as if by magic, through the wall stepped yet another ogre, followed by a tiny floating mound of magma with arms.  <br>
An elemental., There was a mage nearby.  Lishan leaped to his feet and unleashed hell.  The side of the room lit up in a fiery death, driving the ogre back through the illusionary wall.   The elemental, a being made of lava and heat, walked through Lishan’s globe of doom.  <br>
     “Help me, I’m about to have my arse beat by a rock!”<br>
     The creature clasped it’s hands together and slammed them downward into Lishans collarbone.  Lishan went to his knees as his bone was snapped in two.  He screeched in pain then a bright glow fluctuated around him and his scowl of pain turned back to a face of relief.  Aingel had healed him. Mcconnall moved in to engage the elemental, and Lishan turned from his knees to look back at his savior.  She smiled at him and gave a wink.  Lishan admired those eyes, and relaxed his fear.  But the relaxation was short, his smile turned to horror.  Aingel seeing his concern, tried to turn, but was too late, the Necro stepped from the shadows, and drove his dagger home.  Aingel shrieked.  <br>
        Mcconnall could not get back to her, but took a burning blow from the ogre’s club that came surprisingly through the wall.  Lishan stood to his feet, his eyes locked on Aingel’s.  In all her daring, despite the attack she reached out with her magic and healed Mcconnall, bringing him back to his senses.  The dark elf snarled at this open opportunity and went in for the kill.  Lishan continued the finishing touches of his most used and favorite spell.<br>
        This was enough.<br>
                                *                *                *                *<br>
        Mcconnall swung outwards and almost took the head off a traveling bard.<br>
“HEY!” he said just dodging the blow, “Watch it!”<br>
  Aingel healed herself as she slumped to the grass. <br>
        “What the?”  Mcconnall bellowed. “Wizard you didn’t?”<br>
        He had been deprived of his fight because Lishan had ported them all out.  Now he was going to belly ache for hours, despite they just had escaped certain death.  As much as they were friends, there was just no pleasing this guy.<br>
        “Mcconnall…,”  Aingel said weekly.<br>
        Mcconnall ran to her side and began to nurse her wounds.<br>
        “Can you heal it my lady?”<br>
        “In a minute, I am too drained to summon the mana.  I must rest.”<br>
        “Damn!” Lishan cursed.<br>
        The other two looked up at Lishan wonderingly.  The clouds darkened.  Looking up between the massive stone spires Lishan could see a bad storm was brewing.  Rain slammed down upon the three without pity.  <br>
        “Karana is pissing on me…,” Lishan said cupping his hand to catch the rain.  “I left my staff in that room..,  I have to go back.”<br>
        Mcconnall smirked.<br>
