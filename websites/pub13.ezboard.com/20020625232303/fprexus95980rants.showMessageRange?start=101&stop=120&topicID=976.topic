I use to think it was an exploit as well, til I saw exactly what was going on.  Now I think it is dumb VI programming that could have been easily fixed with a continuous call to arms (like once every 3-5 mins).<br>
<br>
Vulak and Tunare would do the same thing.  They would do their CTA (call to arms) once on initial agro.  Now anyone else could also get on their hate list by attacking them or healing an agro person, however they couldn't just by standing there.  If Vulak or Tunare would lose agro for a sec (monk FD's) and then re-gain on someone else (the MT) because the transition wasn't smooth, then they would do another CTA.  This would cause terrible results (ss's/videos of every ntov dragon south of Vulak's intersection coming to say hi).  Pulled it off with chain monks/paladins as Kivi said for Vulak.  Unity pulled it off on a 90% spawned PoG with Tunare using an SK and 2 bards.  Is it cheesy?  Kinda, but easily fixable by Verant by having them call more than once during the fight.  CT calls multiple times while you fight him, so it isn't new technology.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I am quite upset with the Tunare changes.  Clearing PoG is boring and nothing drops anything worthwhile except Tunare.  The equipment gap on them is so huge.  I feel that Tunare in her current state could do without the CTA.  I also feel that the same could be said about Vulak, because his ring and the rest of NToV also has a huge hardness/loot gap that exists in PoG.  When they changed NToV, I was actually hoping for Vulak to stay the same, with a faster CTA refresh, because that would not put him harder than the rest, just make you work up to him.<br>
<br>
Now, having explained exactly how to do those pulls, I can think of a mob that FA has done that can be done the same way.  I am not 100% sure they used the same techniques, but I would put money on it.  How many times did you guys kill Stanos?  Did you guys clear out all of highpass first?  Or did you guys pull him off to a zone line and transfer agro to an MT without him doing his CTA again?  He is setup exactly the same as Vulak/Tunare were, and could even be a good mob to practice understanding how it was done.  I haven't looked, but I bet hard pp that he hasn't been changed either and can be used to demonstrate what KTF/Unity and others were doing in NToV/PoG.<br>
<br>
Just felt like putting that in here, because it seemed to be causing some bad blood that shouldn't exist, especially on such a moot point.  And btw, rooted mobs are generally easier than non-rooted for most part.  There are sometimes little environmental things you have to get past (such as the 6 min respawning enchanters for the IV in Akheva), but the fights themselves are easier. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17455">Dolphin Oceansinger</A><BR>

"Heh typical KTF. "Zone changes make NToV so much easier; it's not quite the tough encounter it used to be"<br>
<br>
LOL whatever, typical elitist fashion. <br>
<br>
I could on the same notes say, "North ToV was SOO much easier when you could use a pathing exploit to Farm Vulak and COH your raid past all the flurry drakes."<br>
<br>
or how bout<br>
<br>
"North ToV was SOO much easier before they nerfed the broods, making it harder to hook your melees up with primals. Guilds with all melees in primals have it SOO much easier"<br>
<br>
INCOMING!! Posts that will explain why it's so much easier now that others can play in the sandbox!<br>
<br>

<br>
Was my post anything to do with these remarks?<br>
<br>
We've always been nice to each other on the boards and in game so I like to think if I have offended you, you would come out and say it.<br>
<br>
As for using the word "gimp", well, "gimp" to me has never been, nor have I ever known it to be, a substitute for "nigger". "Gimp" to me is one of those pathetic sexual slaves who are there to be used and abused. Hence why I use it on mobs who are easy/repetitive. I'm not a racist and do not use racist terms.<br>

  Maddie why dont you ask some of your guildmates that attended Ntov raids with us...Dulaf and Deezull for example..   how the raids went..  how we killed the mobs and if we &quot;gimped&quot; anything.  We make it a point NOT to gimp anything.<br>
 <br>
  Are you that jealous that you have to say such bullshit?   the only thing that you have on us is the Otter thing..  and we werent the only guild doing it..  i wont say any names but many people were there doing it with us or on their own.  IMO it was fun.  Not our fault Otters liked to attack Kelorek'dar.  Lemme remind you this was when Velious first came out.. i mean like no more than 30 people had keys to get into CS when this first was found.<br>
<br>
  As far as the Akheva exploits that your pulling out of your ass... Please show me these exploits.. i never seen them nor have i even heard of them.  We killed pre-rooted Itraer Vius clean like all our kills.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Why dont you stop trying to Bring PDF down by finding any way possible to make PDF's abilities look bad... and go out there with your guild and kill this sh!t..  It doesnt make any sense for you to knock our abilities and accomplishments when you cant do half the things that you see dead on our website.   <br>
<br>
 And for the record.. Vyemm is a pain in the ass that rarely drops his good loot.. i dont blame ktf or unity for passing him up.<br>
 <br>
lastly..maddie.. Aaryonar and Zlexak are the hardest in Ntov(besides ring of Vulak).. you can see their corpses here <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.stasisprexus.com">www.stasisprexus.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  enjoy.   And Your own guildies have seen how we fight.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
well It is true that you can't please everyone all the time. I am sure we find many people who hate the use of the work "dude" also but still it is being used. We are not saying Crippled or anything derogatory like racial slurs. <br>
<br>
I personally hate the word Midget, I have for  long time and I think it is a huge insult to short people. But do people quit using it? Nope. <br>
<br>
this is the definition of Midget:<br>
<br>
midg·et <br>
n. <br>
<i><u>Offensive.</i></u> An extremely small person who is otherwise normally proportioned. <br>
A small or miniature version of something. <br>
A class of small objects, as a class of very small sailboats or racing cars. <br>
<br>
adj. <br>
Miniature; diminutive. <br>
Belonging to a type or class much smaller than what is considered standard: a midget automobile. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the definition of Gimp.<br>
<br>
gimp<br>
n. <br>
A limp or a limping gait. <br>
A person who limps. <br>
<br>
One of Gimp's synonym's is Lame. So all people are saying is that a fight is lame if it has been gimped. no difference. it is all how you take it.<br>
<br>
Until now I would never think bad about the word Gimp and I have had 14 major surgeries on my legs and have never walked perfect my whole life.(when I say major surgery I mean 6hours plus. One procedure was 14 hours and my heart was skipping a beat and was very scary, especially when I was only 14 at the time, that was 17 years ago though) I do walk, well more of a waddle but i have never heard it used in a derogatory way. I have spent lots of my life in doctor's offices and hospitals and I still don't remember hearing it. Maybe its a east coast thing and I am west coast.<br>
<br>
Anyone who is "handicapped" who posts here have a problem with saying the dragons are Gimped when they have been made easier, post here I would like to hear from them also.<br>

<br>
Weird.  The reason I even bring this up is because my best friend has been in a wheel chair since I met him.  He doesn't have much of a problem with the word Crippled at all, but gimp makes him turn red.<br>
<br>
Maybe you grew up in an enviroment that is much more tolerant than the one we are in.  Perhaps you don't live in a big city, didn't have the kids snickering at you in school saying &quot;check out the gimp.&quot;<br>
<br>
When the subject of the usage of this word first came up; it was stories like these that made me understand why that word is so poor.  He explained how using that word made issues of the disabled seem less important to the public, because it gave them something to chuckle about.<br>
<br>
This isn't an overally sensitive guy, heck he's not even really all that nice. We've spoken about the use of Gimp in forums such as these, and he's always made it a point to say how much he hates the word, in any context.<br>
<br>
He's a community advocate, a World Record holder in the Para-Olympics. So I take what he says as what others are feeling too; because he is often in the position of addressing their issues.   I wouldn't be me if I didn't say something when I saw it being used here.  That's how I am, I defend my friends.<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Stooge and others in PDF:<br>
<br>
Did it upset you guys to have unfounded accusations hurled at you?  Don't lie, of course it did that's why you reply.  Did it frustrate you just a little bit, to hear me say things that you knew was not true, and that you had really no choice but to come here and defend yourselves?<br>
<br>
This was exactly how I felt trying to get your members to leave us alone.  Same frustration trying to get people to offer us a simply courtesy.  <br>
<br>
So I dragged your name through the mud.  It was the best way to retaliate to your rude members, whom have yet to apologize for their inappropriate actions; hell they are still trying to defend themselves on the other thread.<br>
<br>
It's not a secret that EA and FA have issues between each other right now.  The day after I posted that thread, we had EA members do the exact same thing that PDF did.  One quick tell to a NON OFFICER in the guild; but who had a small level of respect fixed the problem.  In fact he even joined our chat and apologized.  When trying to do this with various members of PDF we either got the &quot;I can't control them&quot; or we were mocked.<br>
<br>
That's the difference.  PDF is like a mob of uncontrollable children.  Your members, are out here supporting Torasque who has the logic of an adolecent.  Your &quot;fun&quot; is often times at the constant expense of others; which really can't be said of any other guild on this server.<br>
<br>
Stooge, before you say again that I'm jealous about not being able to do the things you do, let me correct you.  I'm not jealous, that we never got down on our knees to another guild.  The impact of one, or two primals in the right hands has a major impact on a raid.  FA could be right where you are right now; we had the chance to raid a select group with EA, and at the time you would not have held a candle to us.  <br>
<br>
FA didn't want that, we wanted to be equals.  We sacraficed a lot for this principle.  I can't really blame EA for not seeing us as equals, at the time. The point being though, all of our members have always had a huge amount of pride.<br>
<br>
We <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  choose </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to accomplish everything 100% on our own.  We didn't buy/trade/aquire any characters that you see on our raids.  When you meet someone from FA, you know that the same person raised that character from level 1.  90% of the gear you see people in, from FA, was aquired from FA raids.   I can think of ONE character that was powerleveled.<br>
<br>
We've sacraficed being uber to uphold our on integrity.  A couple of you mention Fennen using exploits to level, and that's the first I've heard of it.  Fennen's actions though are those of ONE person in the guild, just one.  They aren't the actions of the guild as a whole, and certainly have had minimal impact on our accomplishments.  <br>
<br>
So post on your website pictures that mostly only you will see.  Keep trying to convince the rest of the server that since you can kill really uber mobs, it justifies the means that you used to get there.  <br>
<br>
In my eyes, and several others, we see you as cheating your way to the top.  Using aquired characters in key positions in order to be successful.  No amount of convincing on your end, will ever change that perception.    <br>
<br>
Those of you saying that I'm &quot;jealous&quot; that a bunch of ebayers can do more than we can are flat out wrong.  This game is VERY simple once you know how to lead.  My track record on leading is pretty solid, I think.  I'm no more jealous of PDF, than I am of recent invites to KTF that all of the sudden like to imply that the long standing accomplishments of that guild, are theirs as well.  Give any decent leader a large amount of the right classes; and you don't even need the right people to accomplish <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  most </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> things.<br>
<br>
My pride comes with FA still accomplishing things with lower levels, lesser gear, and lower numbers, than most of those that we compete with.  So if you're curious what makes me smile in the game; it has nothing to do with the mobs we kill.  It has to do with how we kill them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulordzeuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Zeuzz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/22/02 9:05:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=976.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://zeuzz.20m.com/staspent.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: off the subject</span><hr size=1> Maddie you're talking out of your ass again. We never used the bug in Akheva, hell we didn't even knew it existed till a bit back and quite a bit of people from PDF still xp in akheva, go take a look and tell me if they use the bug they never have and they never will. SO let me say this again WE NEVER STOOD IN THE WALL TO KILL IT.<br>
<br>
You weren't talking about Akheva you say, well if you weren't sorry but when you type that after the comment about akheva on the same sentence without any punctuation how the hell am I supposed to know that you changed topic? Maybe tell your 5 year old to teach you punctuation.<br>
<br>
Maddie... you have to do dmg to get summoned or get aggro transfered from soneone that has done dmg. Try chain tashign a mob for 2 hours, uber aggro but won't summon, try thrrowing a CH at a warrior after he has gone in and got aggro, you'll get summoned and prolly die if he doesn't has enough aggro. Point being you can't get enough aggro by attacking and backing off to heal yourself as you said.<br>
This thread is now taking to much time; I'll set expectations that I won't be posting on this topic further, as I have better things to do with my time than discuss things with idiots.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> EMAIL me if you care to discuss further, done with boards for the weekend<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hypocritical again, you say that and then come the next day to post.<br>
<br>
Question for you Maddie, If Nasir and Doesa aren't present at a raid, no ebayed characters on the raid, and we kill the same @#%$, does that means we are cheating? Surprise we don't need everyone to be at a raid, in fact Icky isn't at most raids his gf keeps him busy. Now some info for you, you know that Jerm lvld Nasir from 48 to 60? That the char was ebayed before kunark. That he has 10000 times the skills you will ever have as a monk? He learned his chracter and is one of the best if not the best damm monk on prexus.  Lot more than you can say about your char. Did you knew that Doesa's epic was the first chanter epic completed in EQ, and it was done BY ThE CURRENT OWNER. Of course you wouldn't have any respect cause you are too jealous. The owners of those ebayed characters have done way more than you will ever do, of course your only line of defense is that hey are ebayed cause you are too much of an idiot to see the rest of it.<br>
<br>
You won't ever get an email from me, my email is public but i only use it to talk to my friends, you want to comunicate with me via email feel free but don't expect an answer by email back.<br>
<br>
I'm out, in as hitty mood and figuring out how to kill Vyemm now they nerfed him again.<br>

<br>
First of all maddie.. if the officers gave a damn about losers like you they would control this &quot; uncontrolable mob of children &quot; that your so frustrated with.   We are not out of control WE JUST DONT GIVE A DAMN.   NOBODY from PDF is defying any guild rules when they frustrate you maddie.. or if they do rude things towards you..   we really dont c a r e.<br>
<br>
 PDF never got on down on our knee's for anyone.. if your implying that comment about us with unity your way off..  we had EQUAL amounts of peeps raiding together at the SHORT time we did raids together.. and at the time we could kill all of the Kings of velious alone.. so dont make it sound like we got where we are for raiding with unity.<br>
 yes a couple people got some primal and no it did not make the big difference needed to accomplish our goals.<br>
  we got off our asses and killed many many first broods BY OURSELVES.. and we now have over 50 keys..  we race to ST every 3 days..  we get primal some times and some days we get a bunch of call of earth scrolls.<br>
<br>
Keep talking out of your ass about how you guys would be where we were if you didnt make some sacrafice..  thats a pretty lame excuse..  because you wanted to do things 100% on your own.     PDF has been doing things on their own from the begining of the guild STASIS.    Stasis and unity never teamed up for any reason really.. we were friends at one point and the ONLY mob we had any serious teaming up on was Sontalak and we split the keys the FEW times we did this raid.   <br>
<br>
 90% if not more of our loot is from OUR raids too.. the other 10% would be from the few teamed up raids with unity that makes no difference.   but in just ONE Ntov raid of ours dulaf a pally from FA got a very nice paladin wep from Lord Vyemm and Plate legs for Kael armor quest.  Gratz to Dulaf mr. dorf.  and we are getting asked all the time now if peeps can join us on our Ntov raids. <br>
<br>
with or without those few raids teamed up with unity we would still be where we are today.<br>
<br>
  If you think everything is so simple then do it..  and give me a fvckin break about aquired characters... a very FEW people are non-originals..  we never cheated to the top hah.. we worked pretty hard..you realize how many &quot;uber mobs&quot; we had to kill per week to get where we are? more than the normal high end guild would do.. we worked like a machine alot of times doing mob after mob.. but you wouldnt know anything about how PDF works. <br>
<br>
  the only easy thing about getting where we are today was fcfsing gimps like you to kill mobs we were going after.  oo i said gimp /cry did i offend you?  <br>
<br>
whats funny is how we now know how some of your OWN guild members think of you.. <br>
<br>
flame away!  it is so much more fun when you could care less about what people think or say.  so open your mouth and spit out that sh!t you got all bunched up.<br>
<br>
oh and btw we cleared Ntov again tonight ( cept for ring of vulak /wink lilara )  But its prolly because of those few raids we had with Unity back months ago! /sarcasm off<br>
  err wait..  probably because we have a non-original monk that is better than most originals.    /laugh<br>
<br>
Bah! omg like the only reason you guys can kill the uber Gozzrem  is because of that 1 Yelinak raid you did with EA back then.. i could of sworn i read that on your webpage a while back as if you deserved that much credit.<br>
<br>
you say your not jealous of PDF.. maybe your just jealous of Nasir..   yeah cause he leads a fun guild and leads the very successfull raids and he can pull great.. and.. and .. and..<br>
<br>
im on fire!<br>

   Too bad you didnt team up with EA for things when you could have...<br>
<br>
    You could of seen us in action alot more as we beat them to ST pretty much every 3 days unless we had something else to do.. and now Ntov.  <br>
<br>
oh and about  &quot; our fun is at the expense of others &quot; comment..   im so sick of hearing that.. cry me a fvckin river..<br>

  our fun = raiding.  we raid a whole lot.  every single day pretty much.    we dont raid at the expense of others.<br>

They must be doing a good job if we're killing what we are.  And it saves a bunch of time leveling and tryign to equip a class you need, but dont have avaliable.  <br>
<br>
How does this hurt us, and why do you ALWAYS bring it up in ALL of your posts?  Is this the only thing you can try to say to make us feel bad or less of a guild?<br>
<br>
I think maybe you should just keep your fvcking opinions to yourself and worry about your guild instead of trash talking another.  I talked with a few of your members and from what I can see, no one gave two sh!ts that we joined that raid channel, people were acutally getting pissed off at YOU for busting a hemroid over it.<br>
<br>
You're a very poor representative of your guild, you let your beef with us and others cloud what your guild actually thinks.<br>
<br>
Oh well, you're gonna post here AGAIN about us ebaying, and whatever YOU and not your guild has to say.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
Have you done any NToV dragons nerf or prenerf?  You make it seem like you know everything about how easy / hard there are and were.  Were you in Akheva with us, watching exactly how we killed the Itraer?<br>

Talk about the mobs you killed and the things you've done - so you should - but it's hardly an accomplishment to be online and somewhere before someone else :-)<br>
<br>
(Unless, of course, you had like an equal number of people equally spread around the game world and you started racing at the same time and beat them - I could see that as being something worthy of comment!  But just being online first or sitting around in ST waiting for mobs to spawn isn't an accomplishment that you should be bothering to talk about.  Aaryonar, Vyemm - they're worth talking about, for example). <p><i><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1764>
