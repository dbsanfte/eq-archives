But I see the point, and it does suck for plenty of other time zones.... /shrug<br>
Then again, raids that start at 5pm PST do too, and there've been plenty of threads complaining about that.  Just another part of the serve the majority status quo I guess.<br>

<br>
There is no compensation.  You can't have everyone be able to sign up at midnight local time.  To do that would give the Asian/Australian people a HUGE advantage as they could post for any date they wanted hours before anyone else could. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I mean this has never been a voted issue it was just established and accepted?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It was picked because Verant is located on PST and they post all times dealing with server down times etc on PST (GMT as well).  Doesn't matter which time zone you base it on someone will have to sign up at odd times.<br>

The questions were asked because I was not adept at conveying the whys and wherefores so I thought it best to just put the question forth.<br>

Ok so the patches are all based on PST but that doesnt really mean jack for this board. For the most part, the only importance &quot;time&quot; has on this board is when scheduling things like Fear and Hate. Currently ppl on PST have to post around 12am and EST ppl have to post at 3am to reserve a zone in a GAME. Would it be so earth shattering to change the board time to EST so that u need to post 9pm/12am respectively?? What does the time of a patch really have to do with me going to Fear in 2 weeks? Nothing. It makes it alot easier for all of us I think. Sure you can have someone you know who lives in the PST area to reserve things for you but why &quot;force&quot; ppl to do that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujustise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Justise</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Hero of Brell Serilis <img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/goldstartr.gif align=middle><br><font color=#A0B0E0>&lt;Legion of Heroes&gt;  </font></span><br>  Posts: 785<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/30/01 10:04:17 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://fairblade.sinbad.net/artwork/justisan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maybe new at posting not new at hosting....</span><hr size=1> PST was choosen because just most of the heads of the guilds that found the need for a calender neccisary were on the west coast. Basicly its as simple as that.<br>
<br>
As far as accomidating others who are in time zones that are extremely offset from PST time, lets hear some suggestions. I've seen some good discussions on whether or not we should accomidate them, and I've seen some discussions on abandoning the calender because it severly inconviences the odd time zone guilds. <br>
<br>
And when it comes to actually accepting the changes, good luck.  With no ruling body, and no councils, basicly your going to have to get huge support for it to be willing to be voted on, then you need a large majority to vote in favor of it.<br>
<br>
That is the way its done. So if you want to get the system changed I suggest you get to work, cause it wont be easy. <p>---------------------------<br>

Any time zone chosen benefits some folks and disadvantages others.<br>

PST means I would have to post at 2AM to reserve a raid... within my work schedule that's pretty much right out... otoh for a couple of folks within the guild it's a feasible time, so we end up doing fine on reservations.<br>

Well I dont think it would really be that bad to change the board time to EST. Just like most things in life ppl are just &quot;afraid&quot; of change so to speak. In reality this system has been working for quite some time now and no one really seems to think there is anything really wrong with the time zone issues so they dont see a need for a change. I suggested EST not just because thats where I live, not that it matters since I never have to worry about reserving anything, but because I know ppl who do and find it very aggravating to stay awake until 3am on a weekday. I realize that this may cause problems for the european players so thats why I dont expect the board to switch to EST anytime soon, if at all. European players now probably have to schedule hate and fear around 7-9am their time. Thats actually not that bad considering they are already up and getting ready for work. Changing to EST would mean they need to reserve around 4-6am which sucks. If ppl were to seem content with switching time zones would the board mods consider it or is it to the point where its no longer questionable? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unadiabrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadia brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Brell Serilis News  <img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/goldstartr.gif align=middle></span><br>  Posts: 527<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/30/01 11:36:28 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/_images/nadia100.jpg height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Maybe new at posting not new at hosting....</span><hr size=1> actually...<br>
