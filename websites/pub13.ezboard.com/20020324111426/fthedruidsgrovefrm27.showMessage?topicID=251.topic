<br>
I sold much of my berserker's equipment in order to loan some money to a friend; it worked out well since my zerker had basically been collecting dust since I started a healer... unfortunately, my friend hasn't played lately, and hasn't even come close to making the money the owes me, and I've grown bored to death with my healer, so I decided to try something new.<br>
<br>
Last night I started a paladin on Lancelot, who's almost to level 8 now, and one thing I've noticed is that for some reason, I've having a helluva time keeping my paladin's gear up to date.<br>
<br>
I'm currently using my guild-gift greatsword, which, although yellow, has significantly lower damage output than other yellow 2-handed weapons the merchants sell. I've got about half a suit of iron bone-studded armor, and the other half is rawhide siluric leather; I'm about half yellow, half blue... I know that many tanks keep themselves outfitted in yellow armor with an orange weapon, and I'm just curious how this is possible (or if it's possible at all) without twinking; I was spoiled with my zerker, and had a friend who'd been playing for a long time basically give me all hand-me-down equipment, and I was almost always decked out in orange, and up until my healer was wearing chain, money was never a problem... my lowbie hero on Palimodes has somehow managed to keep yellow armor with an orange weapon without outside help, but that's only because the waterbugs provided such an excellent source of income.<br>
<br>
I'm really having fun trying all these new classes know; I've got a ton of characters right around or slightly above level 10 from all different sorts of classes, and I'm finding I like the tanks best... it's just getting so damned frustrating trying to keep myself in good gear, listening to so-and-so who plays the same class at the same level talk about soloing yellows when I can't even think about doing that, and it's espcially irritating when some blue theurgist runs by and spamcasts his pets at something that cons yellow or orange to me, and then runs on to kill the next thing...<br>
<br>
*sigh* Anyways, I'm rambling. Just... how do you guys do it? <p>--For every winner, there are dozens of losers. Odds are you're one of 'em.

Why blues and greens?  You make less exp but you still get the items and coin they drop.  So your gear is still effective vs them for longer.  Yellow and higher cons give you lots more exp but the cash per kill is not as much on average. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/8/02 5:54:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/zidane.gif WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=64></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Money and melee</span><hr size=1> One word: (well, technically 2 words) tradeskills.

As an armor crafter, I netted 400g doing commissions from 300 skill to 650 skill. (I spent approx 15-20g getting to 300 skill.) If you just want the money, you don't have to go beyond 650 skill.  400g should last you a while. :) <p><CENTER>

<br>
I wasn't aware you could make -that- much money doing consignments; I started powerskilling my healer in armorcrafting -- I'm around 260 with all my secondary skills within 5 points  and my tailoring as high as it can get right now, and it's run me about 7 gold. I finally gave up because I couldn't stand the tedium anymore, and I've heard it only gets worse.<br>
<br>
So for the time being, my trouble's with my paladin (piercing defensive build... I'm going for the uber tank thing). Anyone have any suggestions for hunting in Albion? I just scrapped my other 2-handed pally... I dinged and was suddenly stuck with a blue weapon, 2 pieces of blue armor, the rest green, and no cash to upgrade, even though all I'd done for 2 levels straight was solo (green) dragon ants. <p>--For every winner, there are dozens of losers.

(I never have had money problems in Hibernia - a lot of mobs are grouped and drop treasure chests at low levels and I think that has a lot to do with it)  One thing that will make you feel better though.  Around level 15 or so, your money situation will start to reverse as the monsters start to drop more money and better items.  Also, if you fight in the low level dungeons, you'll be able to equip yourself in low level monster drop items.  There are also quite a few armor/weapon quests you can do to help outfit yourself. (I'd check Kazams for that info)<br>
<br>
Once you hit your mid to high 30's, you won't have money problems at all anymore.  I know several people in their mid to high 40's with 5 to 10 plat that they carry around with them. (1000 gold = 1 plat mind you) <p><table><tr><td height=1 width=1><img src=http://divineguildpics.homestead.com/files/galadriel.gif border=0><td valign="bottom"><b><font size=4 color=0066FF>Salicia Swiftfoot</b><br></font><font size=2 color=red><i>Theurgist to the Stars</i></font><br><font size=2 color=0066FF><b>Galahad Server<br>DAoC Moderator for <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a></b></td>

I powerskilled to 300 and started doing commissions then and was making just enough for me to buy materials and continue advancing.  Mythic designed tradeskills to net you a 7-12% profit with each item, depending on the quality lvl.  (It used to be up to 17% but was nerfed about a month or 2 ago so people with 1st lvl tradeskill mules didn't have more money than say a 40th lvl who just hunts.)  I started doing tradeskills after the commission nerf starting out with about 30g.  When commissions stopped for me at 650 skill, I had a bit over 400g to my name, and over 200g of that came from my last 100-150 skills.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that I'm an armor crafter.  Different professions net different results.  I have heard that fletching is one of the least profitable skills.<br>
<br>
Sure tradeskills gets boring in the long run, but it's not much worse than sitting in one spot for hours and hours farming greens for cash.  Powerskilling is by far the most boring part of tradeskills.  Commissions are a bit better because you run around the city getting to know where all the NPCs are and what they sell or do.  Grab a book and craft away.  I've peeled through several great books while getting my armor crafting to 650. <p><CENTER>
