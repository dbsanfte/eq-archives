The snow was falling heavier with each passing minute.  Could this lad survive the coming winter, there was a chance that he would fulfill that destiny.  He would need help, a guide or mentor, to stay on the proper path.  The watcher had to convince the others that his guidance was needed to keep this boy alive long enough to realize his potential.  He owed it to the T'Ndrkalir clan.  Even the respect he had once held for Sathar demanded that he do something to protect this boy.<br>
<br>
Eight turns ago the council interfered with his attempt to step in and guide boy when his parents were killed in battle.  Their reasoning was simple, to help the son he must also help the daughter.  But the situation is different now.  The daughter inherited the blood of her mothers people and has grown to look more like the half-elves that dwell in Surefall than the child of a Tier'Dal and an Erudite.  Besides, only the council, her brother and the druid know her true parentage.  The boy shows the traits of his mixed blood, and has paid a heavy price for them.  The watcher has seen the pain which the boy has suffered quietly.  But the watcher was stopped by the council when he tried exacting retribution from those bigoted fools.<br>
<br>
The time to act was now. The watcher summoned the council together and once more pleads his case.  &quot;You all know that the duties of a father are to care for his children.  Though Sathar T'Ndrkalir turned from his path, in the end he returned and reclaimed his beliefs and died a true son of the Tier'Dal.  Unfortunately his wife, the Erudite, died too.  This left their children without the nurturing that can only be provided by a familial environment.  Sathar's last words to me were to watch over his son, but you denied me that privilege.  Now his son has left the only home he has known and walks the path of an unsure destiny&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;All here know that there has never been a recorded case of racial mixing where the traits of both races have been so physically noticeable as they are with this child.  He is more Tier'Dal than Erudite, and even the half-elves will not accept him as one of them.  This boy must have someone to help him reach the potential that many of us see.  I beg you to give me that task&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;But what of the daughter&quot; was the only response.  &quot;The girl, while of the same blood, is no longer in danger or need of guidance.  The druid has become her mother and has protected the secret of her birth.  I no longer see a reason to provide my assistance to the girl child's upbringing.  The boy is my main concern&quot;.<br>
<br>
The speaker for the council asked &quot;what of his training?  The rangers of Surefall have spent the last eight turns teaching him what they know.  They taught him their religion, the worship of Karana, and he has prayed to the Rainkeeper for all these turns.  What will you do to continue his training?  You are certainly not a ranger&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can train him in what I know.  He can become a warrior, like his father before him&quot;.  &quot;No&quot; the speaker shouted, &quot;that is not this child's destiny and it will not happen while this council has the power to prevent it&quot;.<br>
<br>
The watcher had a compromise ready, but was not sure the council would accept it.  &quot;There has never been a ranger among the Tier'Dal.  Though the boy is only half Tier'Dal we all agree that in his veins flows the blood of his father.  I cannot teach him the rangers skills but I can guide him to those who can.  Let me act as the boys mentor and I give my word that this will be done&quot;.<br>
<br>
The members of the council whispered among themselves for several minutes, discussing this compromise at some length.  &quot;We will grant your request, but only on one condition.  You may aid the boy only when he calls upon Karana by name.  Accept this, or the boy will have to fulfill his destiny unaided&quot;.<br>
<br>
This was not what he had planned, but it could be made to work to his advantage, given time.  So he accepts the councils conditions and starts to make plans for the boys future training.  The concept of a Tier'Dal ranger was new and he began to revel in the newness.  <br>
<br>
With Elmoran Thundercaller's future now safely in his hands, the watcher turnes to a far more pressing problem.  &quot;Well Sathar, I have fulfilled your dying wish.  Your son will live and, given time, will come to know his true calling.  The council thought to trap me into playing by their rules, but they were wrong as usual.  So now what do I do with one who has denied me?  I guess I should punish you somehow.  Convince me that I should not&quot; he says as a cruel smile appears on the face of Hate.<br>
<br>
His children were safe for now.  His vow to Danira was complete.  Now he must face the father of the Tier'Dal.  Sathar knew that a punishment from Innoruuk would make death far more painful than the swords which took his life.  <br>
