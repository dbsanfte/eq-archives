I'll start.<br>I started playing EQ this last summer at my best friend's house who had moved away 2 years ago.  I stayed there for a week and I was hooked.  played Avethar to 6 before I had to leave.  then my friend played him to 13 and deleted him.  I spent 8 months reading sites and obsessing about the paladin class and high elf race before I finally got the game at home.  so that's since mid-December that I have had my own account.  I was always kind of a good guy.  I wanted to be able to 'tank' (friend had to explain that to me) and heal.  guess what I picked?  lol. anyway, my paladin is now level 26 after about 2 months of play.  I love him to death.  I met up with Ivanthall Raptor at level 2.  who I had seen around on message boards I had been reading for the past 8 months and talked with him about his guild, 13 levels later, I was a very proud member of the Winds of Time.  not too big, not really high level, but it really is like a family.  higher levels sometimes raid, but it's not a big part of our agenda.  mostly helping each other enjoy the game.  I don't have awesome equipment.  I never have. except at level 7 when someone gifted me with a drakkel Icereaver which I still use.  everything I have was either bought with money that I made selling loot, looted from what I killed, or given to me by very kind people.  I hear there are lots of uber raiding guilds on this server, but I don't really mind it, just as long as I can play with my friends.  my friend list is always full and I am constantly having to write names down on a piece of paper lol.  I am currently in Everfrost killing mammoths with my best friend who hooked me on EQ as my partner.  we are cleaning up on them and I'm almost level 27(woot!)  I am doing the ghoulbane quest currently and only have one part.  need to get to karanas to get the quest, I haven't even started it yet, just putting pieces in the bank. I really hate the karanas so it might be a while.<br><br>Avethar Soulforge &lt;Winds of Time&gt;<br>26 High Elf Paladin<br>Bertoxxulous server <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustaticbb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>staticbb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 11:04:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14429.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bertoxxulous server check in!</span><hr size=1> umm im one of four(?) 50+ erudite paladins on bertoxx.  been playing 2+ years.  ummm i like cheese <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uskarniksar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SkarnIksar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 2:26:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14429.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> I started playing a year ago....<br><br>First class was a druid (ugh), then I switched to a rogue which i got to 27...but I quit for awhile because I kept on dying (thanks warriors WHO CANT HOLD AGGRO!!!).

I played for about 2 weeks prior to that on Bristlebain but moved to Bertoxx to play with RL friends.  In reading the EQ manual and the very early spoiler sites I picked the paladin class pretty much for one reason, Holy Swords.  I saw a screenshot of Ghoulbane's stats and said &quot;Sign me up!&quot;.   I chose Human because their XP bonus negated the Hybrid penalty (HA, yeah right) or so I was told.  <br><br>I have played the Paladin more or less full time, I did take a few months to play my druid up to 50 though.<br><br>I have tried to play Vermilion with generousity and valor.  I am a firm believer in helping people when you can both IRL and in EQ.  I think that if something I did in EQ made someone else have a better time playing then I have made a difference.   I have met many fine brother paladins along the way; Gilfalas, Jimicapone, Reaorn, Weirzbowsky, Arist, Argonnis, Artell, Salgor, Galanthalis, Kysharn, Kiero, Landroval, Xavor and a host of others.<br><br>One thing that has always impressed me about the Bertoxx Paladin community is how we have always helped each other out.  Ro Armor quests, Soulfire quests, epic quests we have a history on Bertoxx of Paladins stepping up to help out their brothers.<br><br>As I look back on my EQ career I would not change a thing about my class choice.   We might not be main tanks, we might not do crazy damage, but what we do do is done with style.  And unless you are the most jaded of powergamers, that more than makes up the difference. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56185 ><b>Vermilion Starfires</a></b><BR>54th Level Cavalier of Nife<BR><a href=http://Hon.museek.com><b>Healers of Norrath</a></b><BR>Bertoxxulous<BR><BR><blockquote type=cite><blockquote><hr>Begone, if you be not deathless!<BR>For living or dark undead,<BR>I will smite you, if you touch him.<BR><BR>-<i>Eowyn of Rohan</i><hr></blockquote></blockquote><BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvermilionstarfires.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vermilion Starfires</A> at: 2/12/02 3:50:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1271<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 8:25:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14429.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Howdy</span><hr size=1> Gotta agree with Vermilion 100%.

I just recently got the soulfire, I miss the days when that was an uber sword. <br><br>I am currently a member of Avatars of Solidarity, an up and coming guild with great people (mostly in their 50's) who keeping trying to do stuff, but always seem to find it camped. <br><br>I love going into a newbie zone and giving away stuff and buffing random people, nothing beats a true beginner getting their first non-rusty weapon or a bronze BP. <br><br>If you ever see me online, send me a tell. If I can help you with anything,  send me a tell and I will see what I can do. Or if your guild is doing a raid and needs some more firepower, my guild will usually be happy to help. <br><br>Gondorr Greatheart<br>46 Paladin  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucarmaris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carmaris</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/14/02 9:33:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14429.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bertoxxulous server check in!</span><hr size=1> Soulfire used to be uber?<br><br>Carmaris Stoneheart<br>57 Dorf Knight of Avvisione<br>Bertoxxulous <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugilfalas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gilfalas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 1288<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/14/02 9:41:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14429.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bertoxxulous server check in!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Soulfire used to be uber?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yups it sure was.
