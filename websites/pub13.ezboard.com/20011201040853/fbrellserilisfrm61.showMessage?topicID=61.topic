<br>
First, to dispell a myth, it appears realm invaders WILL BE able to invade your homelands... the odds are so heavily weighed against them that it's unlikely anything successful will occur, but Trolls in Camelot IS possible.<br>
<br>
The Frontier was activated a few days back... we know longer RvR in the battle realms, we RvR in the actual gameplay areas. This means, a persistant and dedicated force can push through their frontier, take a frontier keep at your side, and &quot;cross over&quot; to the high level realms in your homeland. From there they have to push through this hostile territory, take any &quot;frontier keeps&quot; along the way as a staging ground, and eventually take one of the massively NPC guarded frontier castles (Castle Snowdonia or Castle Sauvage in Albion).<br>
<br>
Last night... the Midgards pushed to the gates of Castle Snowdownia.<br>
<br>
Aela and I were playing alts Nicophorus and Aelia with Belstens' Cleric Belbitz. We'd made quite a fair amount of experience, had some nice lewts, and had just returned to Swanton Keep for resupply and training. Vaal logged in as his fighter Casmir and we were chatting. It occurred to me that we had four of our needed eight for a guild. While Mathian's offline for ISP, Telsten is offline for school, and the two Beta folks that'll be joining had already logged off, numerous higher levels and team leads have offered to stand in as an alt to get our eight names when and if we're ready. So, we sent a tell to the highest level Armsmen (and coincidentally Master Armorer), Leland of the Society of Bitter Roses. Leland normally would have, but he told us that Midgard had swarmed through the region of Snowdonia, captured a Frontier Keep and was attempting to besiege Castle Sauvage (none of the new Siege Engines present). He asked instead if Ryahl and Aela could be made ready for the defense.<br>
<br>
We agreed.<br>
<br>
After escorting Belbitz to a safer location in case the Castle should fall (Swanton Keep would have been the next point of defense), we logged in and went to the Castle. Things inside the Caslte were calm... although the NPC wizards and Master Archers along the wall were appearing to be more active and animated than Iv'e seen them before. We stepped out the Back gates of Castle Snowdonia... <br>
<br>
... and into a battlefield.<br>
<br>
As many as 50 Albion Defenders and an equal number of NPC's were holding the plateau that Snowdonia Castle lies on. Our Scouts and Casters were at the forefront launching volleys of arrows and magics to keep the enemy off the ledge. Armsmen and Paladin made sorties forwards trying to catch offguards Midgard Archers and Mages countering. We'd send troops to the right and left flank to try and stop their periodic melee charges. As teammates died, Friars Clerics and Paladins (over 30'th) would move forwards and revive the downed comerade to keep them in the battle (preventing a runback... our nearest Bindstone was a town away, Midgards was several zones... defenders have a significant logistical edge)<br>
<br>
It was grand.<br>
<br>
Midgard was higher level. Most of their force was purple to all but our highest. A few of their expendables were grey (15th ish) and used to move forwards and take reconnaisance. During one of the sorties, I was dropped too far forwards for a speedy revive... Aela nearly died a few times trying to get to the edge of her casting range... however, since i didn't /release I could somewhat pivot my camera... I was able to ascertain they had twenty or some on a hill down the plateau from us. I informed one of our battle leaders of their numbers... Albion was organized and a charge occurred... one of the rear Clerics on the charge stopped to rez me. I found Aela, got my buffs... waited for rez sickness to pass and went down to join our jubilant troops.<br>
<br>
We'd won the day and routed the aggressors.<br>
<br>
We weren't done.<br>
<br>
We had to take our frontier keep back. So we took our army across Snowdonia to the Frontier Keep now controlled by Midgards NPC's. In the top of the tallest tower of the Keep is an NPC Lord... should he fall dead, the castle would restore to ours and the new Lords and Guards would be Albion... our banner would once again fly.<br>
<br>
We stormed the fort. Holding together, we took out many of their patrols till we could storm through the doors and gates and into the bailey. Once inside things went chaotic... attackers broke into subsets at random, charging up the walls, and attacking the archers on them. Various teammates died under the arrow volley but our Clerics and Friars quickly restored them to the fight.<br>
<br>
I wound up beside a Paladin... oddly not even one in my group... we cleared an entire wall together (with many timely heals from passing Clerics and Friars) and rendezvoused with many of our forces on one of the archery towers... we then charged... the Lords tower.<br>
<br>
DAoC DOES have epic MoBs. That Lord dropped MANY of our melee types. I tanked him for sometime, but it was dicey and I know I drained a healer or two's mana. That fight was every bit of an EQ Planar fight... one tough assed mofo of a MoB... several teams of determined heroes.<br>
<br>
Finally... the Lord dropped. Albion had won the day in totality. The new Albion Lord and his retainers took charge, the Albion banner flew proudly... <br>
<br>
The whole thing was a blast.<br>
<br>
I made two realm points... blah.  I lost nothing (for the death)... my heart was pounding through the evening in a way it's rarely done in EQ... or any MMOG. I'll submit that &quot;PvP done right is amazing gameplay&quot;... and DAoC IS PvP done right.<br>
<br>
