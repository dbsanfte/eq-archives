Unity had a mage in HOT with us and was summoning people. Ooze was summoned and Im sure got too close to the door and caused the train that killed a few people. I dont know if this was intentional or not, and I would hope it wasnt because Ooze knows alot of people in our guild and was in Di Oppresso one of our founding guilds. Needless to say we know him, so I have a hard time believing it was on purpose..but it did happen.<br>
<br>
Soeb was an officer of Sword of Fate, a guild that was part of our early alliance to do VS about a year ago. Morkenlar had forged this alliance between several guilds and Soeb and some other officers in SoF were trying to take control of it. They complained regularly about loot drops even though they got more than half the drops and were 1/4 the alliance. Soeb joined KTF because SoF couldnt do what he wanted to do fast enough. Hes an excellent player but a control freak.<br>
<br>
Warador - You werent with us long enough to catch a clue, let alone raid with us &quot;many times&quot;. Your constant tardiness to raids meant we got you in a group as best we could. You did not have primary slowing responsibilities because you were AFK so much, and we couldnt rely on you.<br>
<br>
Chronnos, yes we were in HOT for 8 hours pharming the named. We killed all the named and Dozekar and it took us 8 hours. That we did not kill Dozekar first was a question I asked a few times to my fellow officers, and was told we will do him after we clear the named, which we did. I have seen other guilds in HOT for HOURS on end, on days the named are up, Unity and Nameless with their &quot;quiet&quot; rotation sharing thes e spawns spend hours there during these days. I have watched from other zones. Its the fact we are the new guild on the block to be trying things wanted by the older raid guilds that makes all of our actions be under a microscope. I remember EA being treated much the same way.<br>
<br>
Trike, Im glad you posted our roster. Yes take a look at us everyone and see the roster of players that arent online 100% of the time because most of us are adults with jobs and families. We have a core of maybe 18-24 players online everyday, our raids are then comprised of whoever logs on for that day. Who cares what size we are? Ive been told unity has 60+ level 60s for ntov raids....should people hate you for that?<br>
<br>
Awulfe- good luck with the guild relations thing with KTF. When I was in Unity, all they did was talk shi$ about KTF and were jealous beyond words. As long as that stupid jealousy exists with its leadership, Unity will always be a second rate raid guild.<br>
<br>
Kindof- TA is a great guild, you have some great people who play for the fun of the game. Its not about all this political crap and hopefully it never will be for you guys.<br>
<br>
Dysdain- Thank you for your support. Your an awesome ally and a good friend. I hope we can return the favor and assist you at some date in the future.<br>
<br>
Our merit system/large raids - We have a points based system that allows people to measure their merit and watch it grow. This is available to even people outside the guild and prospective recruits. Because we have such a system, we dont refuse peoples rights to raid, we dont put our ego into raiding and say&quot; We will only do this with X amount of people and the rest of you cant get merit for it&quot;. Part of the problem with such a manner of doing merit is people log on and want to come, this can delay our raids and we are working to improve upon that. So yes, you might see alot of us to kill even Venril Sathir, because he is worth merit points to those who attend. Dont mistake that for our inability to kill mobs with less people. We are simply more inclusive than some guilds I guess.<br>
<br>
Oh, and yeah we have wipeouts, like Unity, like KTF, hell like everyone. They happen, but you wont see me sending tells to those guilds adding insult to injury, or camping behind them to wait for a wipeout to take THEIR spawns that they got there first for, or walking over their bodies to do so. <br>
<br>
Walking over someones body is saying &quot; Hey, we see you guys, but we are better than you and want this mob.&quot; Its not saying, Ok you had your shot, now its our turn&quot;, lets be honest. Some guilds would use that to keep other guilds from learning new places, or as a way to be insulting to them.<br>
<br>
Everyone else- IV has been told by Unity and Nameless that we arent &quot;allowed&quot; to be in the private rotation of the named in HOT. This is because we dont share their beliefs about what FCFS should be.<br>
<br>
We feel that a raid capable guild, with a force present, and more online AND en route FIRST, should have the opportunity to kill the mob or give up trying. Unity and Nameless have claimed we camp mobs with &quot;corpses&quot; because we have a wipeout. Yet when they wipe-out, its because &quot;we were trying something different&quot; or &quot;we can do it with 24 people&quot;. So we should just accept that nonsense and let them have their spawns, and let them have our spawns. <br>
<br>
Twice in the last 4-6weeks Unity has had at the MOST 2 groups clearing mobs to do Rhag 1 in Ssraeszha. They would wait there in the tunnel between the zone and his room pulling respawns while more people showed up...On both occassions we scouted the zone, saw them there, asked their intentions and moved on. Even with people en route, we turned back and went about our day. We dont believe people should threaten or wait behind a raid waiting for them to wipeout to take the spawn. We dont have a calendar anymore, but that doesnt mean we have to treat each other in this manner. <br>
<br>
According to Unity and Nameless way of thinking, guilds are not allowed to learn anymore. If you wipe out expect them to walk over your bodies to do a mob they were allowed to learn on without people walking past them and denying them the chance. Are they specially gifted or talented? Hell no. They have had the time to learn and practice on the mobs other guilds will be trying for the first time. When I was with Unity, when Velious came out, Vindi KICKED our asses hard everytime we tried him. But they kept practicing and trying new things to learn, unmolested by KTF or anyone else. They didnt have that kind of pressure, and YES they spent 8+ hours at least on those days doing it. <br>
<br>
Now we have a crowded server, with 7-8 guilds big enough or experienced enough to do alot of things. This severely limits our raid potential as a server, and causes ALOT of tension and fighting. The greedy people who joined these guilds have no patience for diplomacy or trying to get along with others, and even though those guilds may have a majority of people who are decent, the greedy sometimes win over and cause situations like what happened between Unity and IV in HOT.<br>
<br>
Kindof you asked &quot;how is it you guys refuse to get along&quot;. We dont....we embrace it...<br>

You have no idea why Trike retired.  On that topic, kindly FOAD.<br>
<br>
What's more, we were never spoiled.  The reason Unity could do encounters without competition before if because we were capable of doing them before other groups.  Being spoiled suggests some undue benevolent benefactor was sponsoring us.  Not the case.  Our ability to do those things flowed entirely from our own efforts.<br>

KTF and Unity get along fine. I was flirting with Darodar when I made that comment. Unity does not have a problem with most of the guilds on the server. <br>
<br>
You talk about ego and numbers and level 60's. We all have jobs too, you know. And for a guild that has 20something people on every day, you sure do have a lot of people on raids. <br>
<br>
Yes, we have had our zergling days, that is why we feel free to laugh about it being someone elses turn. Can't take the heat? hehe<br>
<br>
You seem to have a lot of anger built up. Every guild has had someone get their first, or had someone wait to do a mob when they were done. It is FCFS, and like it or not that is how it is. Get over it. Anyway, if we thought you could take Doze down, we wouldn't have been waiting. But then again, if you thought you could take him, you wouldn't have called in back-ups. @#%$, if we knew you were going to do that, we wouldn't have bothered waiting. At least you got to waste our time 8) Feel good about yourself. <br>
<br>
Unity has become tight internally. We try to do more with less. It is not just the mob dying, but how well we kill it. Do we take pride in that? Hell yes. Do you seem to have issues with that? I think so. Get over it, and work on how well you do something. Then maybe you can have some pride in yourself, and not need to look for reasons to belittle others.<br>

Your constant tardiness to raids meant we got you in a group as best we could. You did not have primary slowing responsibilities because you were AFK so much, and we couldnt rely on you.&quot;<br>
<br>
My constant tardiness?  My ass.  The only raid I went to late was 2nd day of the Air Raid that was the worst raid I had ever been on.  And that was after a few of you kept giving me tells to get me to go.  The first day I was helping my real life brother get his epic quest going.  Sorry, real life people take priority for me in video games.<br>
<br>
The only time I went afk was for a cigarette..  usually one or two times an hour.  I smoke about a pack a day.  You do the math.   I WAS primary slower for 75% or more of the raids I was on with you guys.  I remember two raids where I was the slower even with Matrix there...  who was level 60 and sucked ass.   <br>
<br>
I don't expect you guys to just admit your guild sucks.  I'm not an idiot.  Of course you're gonna try to flame me and make crap up.  Whatever floats your boat.  <br>
<br>
Mullzy, who are you?  (i recall being on more raids while I was there than you were on, maybe you're in a different time zone)  The only skilled shamans you had was a female barbarian shaman, sorry can't remember her name  (starts with a &quot;K&quot; maybe..  Kilany?), and myself. <p>Warador McCoin

I have to laugh at your line of BS and the BS your trying to twist here. You fvcktards were in tov for over 7 hours. you were wiped out, you had your chance. I gave you all fair warning about incoming pulls. But all you pansys could do was whine and threaten. It was our fault we let you delay us to get more people to zerg Dozekar. <br>
<br>
Also, you don't even know what happens in unity anymore. You have been gone forever, which is a good thing, since your such a dumb fvck. Lets see, why did you leave Unity.....<br>
<br>
hmmmmm could it be cause someone got ES greaves over you and you cried like the baby you are and left. you fvcking loot whore loser. Waaaa I didn't get the loot I want so I am leaving. <br>

Soeb was an officer of Sword of Fate, a guild that was part of our early alliance to do VS about a year ago. Morkenlar had forged this alliance between several guilds and Soeb and some other officers in SoF were trying to take control of it. They complained regularly about loot drops even though they got more than half the drops and were 1/4 the alliance. Soeb joined KTF because SoF couldnt do what he wanted to do fast enough. Hes an excellent player but a control freak.<br>

<br>
can you say hypocritical Backdooralley. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also you idiots tried to bully Smaller guilds in HoT. Thinking you were all bad ass. As I said in the guildleaders forum and I will say it here, your a collection of idiots and don't have a clue. All you do is piss and moan when you feel threatened. You pull bs tactics when delaying other guilds.<br>
<br>
lets see...here is a excellent example, you and some of your lackys were sitting in our pull path of eashan of the sky, you knew it was incoming and you just sat there. Of course you idiots died and then tried to petition us cause we pulled saying it was a train. Ever since that day it was clear that you guys are idiots and the only way you kill anything is to zerg it to death. <br>
<br>
So just keep your zerg asses out of my way and my guild cause next time we don't let you pull that delay tactic bs. Not a threat, but a heads up. <br>
<br>
I don't really care if you flame me, hate me, think I am the biggest ass there is. But when I encounter idiots like you and some of your guild, I just don't plan to cut you fools any slack.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showPrevMessage?topicID=920.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showNextMessage?topicID=920.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=122><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.emailToFriend?topicID=920.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.threadControl?topicID=920.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=920.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=920.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
