<br>
When I started playing EQ (before ANY expansions) I had next to NO lag with a dial-up modem, 500mhz CPU, 64 megs of RAM, an embedded sound card, and 11 megs of embedded video memory. As soon as Kunark came out it was lag central and has only gotten worse. I think Verant has no clue when it comes to upgrades, and their obsession with newer graphics is just silly. I will always take good game play over good graphics. Looks like Dark Age of Camelot has both. The down side for me as a guild leader is that I will have to keep playing both because I want to enjoy a new and better game, but keep my friends here too. Oh well, EQ is still more fun than not (for now). hehe <p>"Oh, come, come, come! Without a monster or two it's hardly a quest at all! Merely a gaggle of friends wandering about!"

This is nothing more than doom with a fantasy setting.  The artificial intelligence sucks on creatures.  But I love to hear how people use strategy.  You do not use strategy in this game at all.  You find a flaw in the game mechanics and exploit it.  You break the game.  And once you have done it you do it over and over and over.  Nothing really changes or fluctuates.  The only reason I play is out of friendship the game lost my interest about a month ago.  If they actually had a decent AI and some people who role play it might be cool.  But as for now it is a bunch of space monkeys running around bragging about there latest pixelated kill.  Anyways I hope the Lord of the Rings MMRPG will have more to offer than this.  Or star wars galaxies.  But as my subject stated this was never anything more than a fantasy doom setting with a chat room added on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unervana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nervana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/15/02 1:58:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: When was it ever anything more than doom with a twist</span><hr size=1> Thats all any of 'em are.

As a side note, I have a few friends with nice computers.   1ghz or better processing speed, 384 or better ram, geforce 2 or better cards, and all of them have noticed a decrease in game performance in all the worlds.  For some of them, SOL is almost unplayable..<br>
Verrant truly did a diservice to the loyal player base with this untimely expansion. I have never encountered a game that uses up every resource on your computer and still wants more. It comes down to shitty programming coupled with a rushed product.  If it werent for the USEUMBERAL=false command, I dont think I would be playing anymore.<br>

I skimmed through your post, but I'd like to know how you know everyone just exploits bugs in the game to conquer a NPC?<br>

There is strategy to taking high end mobs down...maybe some use exploits, maybe some don't...but the AI seems just fine to me.

I would get annoyed and hover about 30 feet off the ground and demolish the little band of invaders with breath weapon and wing buffet and tail whip.  Sounds like a smart dragon to me. Or lets take a simpler mob shall we the alien in maidens who you are cutting up like a thanksgiving turkey.  He has friends everywhere yet never yells for help.  How retarded is that.  That is zero use of brain power.  And shaorinor there is zero strategy in this game due to that point.  Once you have broken or exploited a flaw in the game mechanics it is the same thing over and over.  It never changes.  The mob is not gonna think hey those guys kicked my ass that way the last time.  So do not fool yourself into thinking you are using strategy.  Maybe if this was a decent sim such as combat mission or panzer campaigns I would buy into what your saying.  <br>
<br>
The AI sucks, no one role plays.  It is all about loot.  Yet some of the people with high end loot play like 3rd lvls.  Now if they let people play those high end monsters you brag about then I am sure you would get your ass handed to you on a regular basis.  Or give it some sort of thought process.  Maybe shaorinor you never played any role playing games when you grew up but the ones I played the monsters were not cannon fodder and dragons were like killing gods.  Just not a everyday feat. <br>
But as I said keep living the lie of you using strategy.  I saw how the strategy worked when 103 people got smashed by tunare.  That was almost custerlike.  I bet he was leading the charge right.<br>
<br>
Learn to think outside the box buddy.  Oh I loved kryas retort about your moronic guildmates messaging me and she said she is just a member of fallen alliance yet your guild follows the leader like a honda and she bashes me for bashing her.  I get msgs from people who have no clue about me yet for some silly ass reason they hate me because they are in fallen alliance.  LOL whatever dude.  Get over the message board gig.  Obviously you cant.  Part of healing is processing what happened and moving on.  Maybe your guild should have a big meeting one night and sort it out.  Or maybe there is some 12 step program for you guys.  <br>
<br>
Anyways have fun.  I know I am.<br>
Remember buddy it is just a game.<br>
And yes shaorinor I am way beyond what happened with the msg boards and all that silliness. It seems your group of 5yr olds isnt.  But do not flatter yourself to think I dwell on it.  If anything it annoys the phuck out of me.  Remember shaorinor your guilds opinion of me is not the reality of me.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uianthiafoehammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ianthia Foehammer</A> at: 1/22/02 4:40:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushaorinorsoulbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaorinor Soulbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 2:55:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You are kidding right shaorinor?</span><hr size=1> Well, what kind of AI would it be if you couldn't kill anything?

<br>
Most of the movies I've seen that involved dragons have involved them being on the ground screaming at the person.<br>
<br>
AI isn't perfect, it just seems like you're asking too much of a program...it's hard to make AI so perfect.<br>

In any event, who the hell is talking about my guild?  I didn't say anything about them did I?  I could really care less about what happened a month ago, let alone 2-3 months ago...I don't even play EQ anymore.  If you're so over it, why did you mention it?  <br>
<br>
Add:  You read into my post too much, I just disagreed with your line of thinking.<br>

These aren't exploits that people are using, these are game mechanics.  Exploits involve cheap tactics which allow people to romp around the game w/ no worries whatsoever. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushaorinorsoulbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaorinor Soulbringer</A> at: 1/22/02 2:57:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uianthiafoehammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ianthia Foehammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 4:25:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You are kidding right shaorinor?</span><hr size=1> Well being as most dragons are hundreds if not thousands of years old they are smart.  And any band of merry adventurers is gonna have one hell of a time killing one.  As for AI limitations try playing some games that have a good AI perhaps ghost recon or a good war sim.  When you shoot at a soldier he does not just recklessly attack he takes cover and yells for his friends.  Unlike the alien who takes his rodney king like beating with a smile on those white teeth.<br>
<br>
And yes you moron I am over it.  Your pre pubescant guildies apparently are not tho.  I guess I will have to use the ignore command on every dumbass fallen alliance member who msgs me out of the blue.  The only one that is worth a damn is a paladin named emilly.  <br>
<br>
And if you do not play anymore why the phuck are you posting on here.  Are you that addicted to a game that you cannot let it go.  <br>
<br>
As I said I have let it go eons ago I was over it the day it happened.  I just get very annoyed by 5 yr old type behavior.  Nanny nanny nanny, neener neener neener.<br>
<br>
Like I said find some 12 step program or a self help book.  You guys can have a pow wow and read it out loud.  Do whatever it is you gotta do to move past what happened buddy. <p><P ALIGN=Center>

Don't come crying to me because my guild hates you...because no one really gives a rat's ass anymore unless you try to talk to them...just don't talk to them and no one will care.  You also act as if FA is 10 people big...it's not.  But I'm sure if Emmily was remotely active as she once was and saw your posts, she'd be pretty disheartened as well.<br>
<br>
I don't even know why you brought it up if you're over it.  I did not insult you in my post either, and yet you call me a moron.  I guess I see who's trying to be the bigger person.  All I stated, in my own words, was that I really couldn't care less what you did months ago because it's behind me and I really couldn't care less unless you hassle me endlessly like you are trying to do now...please don't push it, because I'm not pushing you.<br>
<br>
Why am I still posting here?  Because I'm bored.  I'm studying in the library or at home and the TV is off, so when I start falling asleep or getting bored, I come look and post when I want to.<br>
<br>
Do I need to explain myself to you?  No.  But there is your explanation.  If and when you quit, I don't care if you post here or not...why do you care if I do?<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, I still have lots of friends that play EQ, and I still enjoy speaking/debating with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uianthiafoehammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ianthia Foehammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 5:20:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Ajax just pucker your lips up and kiss my brown starfish you ass nugget.  Glad you are in that lamer guild whats is its name &quot;Stagnant&quot;.  Where all the duds end up that failed the cut for the big guild tryouts.  Yes ajax that is right.  But you keep on believing your own hype. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You will always be the little engine the couldn't.  Hey Ajax you planning that Uber raid for &quot;Stagnant&quot; in Crushbone wait the emp might flip ya like a stack of IHOP flapjacks better play it safe buddy and raid orc hill.<br>
<br>
And shaorinor what part of I do not give a phuck about you or your guild did you not get.  Just curious becuase I can type it in another language for ya if ya need it. I think I said more like annoying.  Like someone asking you the same thing over and over and over.  Let it go buddy you and your guildmates do that 12 step program or have a group hug and you will feel alot better about yourselves.  And always remember shaorinor this is a game.  Nothing more nothing less. <p><P ALIGN=Center>

Oh I loved kryas retort about your moronic guildmates messaging me and she said she is just a member of fallen alliance yet your guild follows the leader like a honda and she bashes me for bashing her. I get msgs from people who have no clue about me yet for some silly ass reason they hate me because they are in fallen alliance. LOL whatever dude. Get over the message board gig. Obviously you cant. Part of healing is processing what happened and moving on. Maybe your guild should have a big meeting one night and sort it out. Or maybe there is some 12 step program for you guys. <br>
<br>
Anyways have fun. I know I am.<br>
Remember buddy it is just a game.<br>
And yes shaorinor I am way beyond what happened with the msg boards and all that silliness. It seems your group of 5yr olds isnt. But do not flatter yourself to think I dwell on it. If anything it annoys the phuck out of me. Remember shaorinor your guilds opinion of me is not the reality of me. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That's from your post.  This is after I posted something in disagreement to you.  Notice how this has nothing to do with what I posted previous to it.<br>
<br>
Then you can tell me that I'm not over it and you are.<br>
<br>
You're the one who brought it up, I didn't do anything of the sort.  I don't give a flying phuck about you either...I just happened to disagree with what you were saying and replied with what was my opinion.<br>
<br>
I don't see what the big fuss was about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushaorinorsoulbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaorinor Soulbringer</A> at: 1/23/02 7:06:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utekke.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tekke</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 7:44:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> ianthia do you have message board tourettes syndrome or something? keep your @#%$ mouth shut jesus christ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unagster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nagster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/23/02 11:07:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=823.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.oobalance.com/images/sig.gif width=97 height=79></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> OMG...LOL....I literally spit my Pepsi out when I read that Tekke!<br>
