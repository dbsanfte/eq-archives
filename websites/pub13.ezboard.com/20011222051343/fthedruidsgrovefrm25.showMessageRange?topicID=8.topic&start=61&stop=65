Roleplaying games have two essential elements: (1) &quot;roleplaying,&quot; in the sense of the player taking on a particular role and acting and reacting in that role; and (2) quantitative character description and action resolution.<br>
<br>
It's a balancing act between the level of abstraction and the fun of gameplay.  Make the game too specific, and it becomes less fun for the majority of players.  Make the game too abstract, and it becomes less of a RPG.  <br>
<br>
The quantitative element is where you can best see the level of abstraction.  How many statistics are used to define the character?  3, as in UO?  7?  More? <br>
<br>
How are basic skills divided?  Is there a single &quot;melee combat&quot; skill?  Is it broken down into a couple of categories (e.g., 1HB, 1HS, 2HS, 2HB, HTH)?   Is it broken down even further (e.g., Axes, 1-H Swords, 2-H Swords, Polearms, Crossbows, Bows, etc.)?<br>
<br>
And so on.   The level of abstraction is the key decision that the game designer has to make when designing the RPG.   <br>
<br>
Which is getting off the point of the thread.  It doesn't matter what P&amp;P RPG you choose, you still have human intelligence controlling your adversary--be it a monster, an NPC, or the &quot;environment&quot; itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://aodoctors.homestead.com/files/cross.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/13/01 4:35:25 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tangent, please ignore</span><hr size=1> Scirroco, I understand what you are saying, about Human interaction. It is very important.<br>
<br>
However, The commonly accepted definition of PvP is a small, small subset of this interaction. In the case of a D&D GM, I would not label that as Human Versus Human. The DM's goal is not to defeat the players. Instead, the goal of the GM is to entertain. There is a Huge difference there.<br>
<br>
Yes, the GM may be playing the role of dozens of creatures that the players run into, and fight, negotiate with or run from. But, the GM's job is not to be versus those players. If that was the case, any D&D campaign would be incredibly short-lived.<br>

There is nothing that requires that.  As you note, the primary goal of any game should be entertainment...to have fun.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;But, the GM's job is not to be versus those players. If that was the case, any D&amp;D campaign would be incredibly short-lived.<br>
<br>
Sure, it's the the job of the GM to be vs. those players.  What do you think he or she is doing?  Taking on the role of the adversary, and thus providing the players a challenge in the game, that's what. <br>
<br>
In fact, to the contrary of your statement, any D&amp;D campaign without the GM taking an adversarial role is what would be short lived.  Without that challenge, there's really no game at all.<br>
<br>
Now, if your point is that the nature of HvH in AD&amp;D is different from what we usually see in MMORPGs (which is usually referred to as PvP), well, I agree, because that's one of my original points.  Which is why I ask the question of how to incorporate more HvH into MMORPGs in a good way.<br>
<br>
For example, take the situation of a group of adventurers being ambushed by bandits while travelling.  In AD&amp;D, the bandits are controlled by a human being taking those roles...the GM.  A good GM balances the encounter so the players stand a reasonable chance of surviving, depending on how they react. Some of the players may die in the encounter, in fact, with ensuing consequences.<br>
<br>
In a MMORPG, ideally those bandits would also be controlled by human beings taking those roles, but instead of a GM, they're players.  Of course, they have different motivations: the desire to prevail if possible, but also the desire to not die (which depends on the consequences).  So, the question each new MMORPG that seeks to do this is: what sort of restrictions do we need to put in to make this work?   What sort of consequences do we need to add to the acts of the bandits to control such acts?   <br>
<br>
Of course, one alternative is to just screen the player population, which isn't done with UO, EQ, etc.  NWN is going in that direction, I think.  Of course, it's not really a MMORPG at that point, just a MORPG.<br>
<br>
As I said to start with, those are the experiments we're seeing in DAC, AO, Shadowbane, SWG, and other upcoming games. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=badaf>Badaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/16/01 4:05:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tangent, please ignore</span><hr size=1> Scirocco<br>
&quot;Meddik, why do you think the &quot;goal&quot; of HvH is to defeat the other side?&quot; <br>
<br>
Because thats what &quot;versus&quot; means to me (and most others). Give me some examples of when X vs X does not imply the &quot;defeat&quot; of one or the other. You will be hard pressed to find any. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umeddik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Meddik</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://aodoctors.homestead.com/files/cross.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/16/01 4:45:30 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tangent, please ignore</span><hr size=1> Scir: I understand that in a P&P RPG, the GM does control the Adversaries of the players. In that regard, the GM is "versus" the players.<br>
<br>
However, it is not the goal of the GM to defeat the players. THe GMs goal is to entertain the players, by putting them up against a reasonable challenge.<br>
<br>
In normally understood Online PvP, there are 2 players against one another. These two players are Generally of similar power within the game. Their goal is to defeat one another. (Of course, there is group vs. group PvP, but same thing there.)<br>
<br>
Its 2 entirely different scenarios. One is to create encounters, the other is to destroy the opposing side. 2 different mentalities altogether.<br>
<br>
I do think that the GM concept is nice, although right now I don't know of any MMORPGs that really use that concept at all. Instead, they use the PvP concept, which is not nearly as much fun to most people. Nobody wants to get their butt beat by another player. Look at the number of people in EQ, AC or UO on non pvp servers. Similarly, most people in AO avoid entering PvP areas as well.<br>
<br>
Human interaction good, but PvP is bad. If you want to try and redefine PvP to something other than what it commonly means to everyone else, thats fine. But don't expect everyone else to agree with you. <p><center><B>Meddik,</B> Rebel Doctor
