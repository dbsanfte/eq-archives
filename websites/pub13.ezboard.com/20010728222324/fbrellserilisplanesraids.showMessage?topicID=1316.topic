I have been and still am very proud of our community, and often thank the early August 1999 day I bought Everquest and chose Brell Serilis as my home.  Each time I read the links posted to other server message boards, and the problems existing, I thank the day again.  Yet as much as I wish server populations could be capped, they aren't.  As much as I wish I could preserve the days of balanced levels across the server, where I felt I knew every plane capable person by name, I can't.  We all have to work together within the world we enjoy.<br>
<br>
It's no secret: we are at a crossroads, a dangerous one at which resources have become limited, and the politics of the server loom over many aspects of our game play.  The length and reputed abuse of the Venril Sathir list that continues to frustrate players and guilds is just one obvious example.  Growth, and reservability are two others.  The frustrations of some larger guilds, justifiably and understandably, is yet another.  Solutions have been proposed, forum threads opened, all with mixed response, very polar response in fact, illustrating the gradual and inevitable pressure in the Brell Serilis pot.  More and more often we read, hear of, or even experience first-hand the results of this tension, and while we seek solutions together the pressure grows.  Our community, and the sense of respect and honor we have built, is at risk; people find their frustrations challenging, and in some cases surmounting, their desire to preserve the atmosphere of equality that has become tradition on our server.  Can a FCFS system work on our server?  I think so, honestly, yet although it is perhaps more efficient in terms of mobs killed over a given time - its strongest argument in my opinion - I fear for the impact it may have on our relationships with one another.  I'm not sure if all of us can maintain a sense of respect (not monopolizing, giving as well as taking, etc.).  Some posts I have read on our boards, and the boards of some guilds, make me uneasy.  But this is beyond the formal systems we may adopt together.<br>
<br>
My greatest concern here is for Brell, and we are making progress in this time of trial.  Too many people to name are attempting to forge a system that keeps the greater population in mind, and it isn't easy or without sacrifices.  Most importantly, beyond a philosophical difference between others and myself about what intentions mean - beyond the Plane of Growth, whether or not FCFS = FFA or not, etc - is the fact that the very spirit of our community is at stake.  I, for one, vote for honor and respect in whatever forms that may take.  I vote to preserve our respect for each other.   I vote to see justice come to those who abuse our system, whatever we decide and however that may be, even though I wish it wasn't necessary in the first place.  I vote for reason and understanding for everyone's opinion, in an attempt to seek a solution, with a desire for harmony foremost in our minds.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, being only one player, I can promise you that I and those I hunt with will always honor your intentions: there are plenty of other things for us to do with our game time, and preserving the spirit of the server is more important to us than any equipment we may get.  <br>
<br>
It's all about being cool to each other.<br>
<br>
To emphasize what I personally, and many others for that matter, value most, I close with a paraphrased exchange that our Officer of Education, Nagasakee Waa, always has with young monks that we tutor periodically as part of our guild community service:<br>
<br>
Nagasakee says, &quot;I invite all of you to approach and inspect me, and tell me what the most valuable possession is I have.&quot;<br>
A half dozen monks inspect.<br>
Young monk 01 says, &quot;Hero Bracer.&quot;<br>
Young monk 01 says, &quot;I'm sorry, brother, I don't really know equipment very well.&quot;<br>
Young monk 03 says, &quot;Robe of the Lost Circle.&quot;<br>
Young monk 04 shrugs.<br>
Young monk 05 says, &quot;Treant Fists.&quot;<br>
Young monk 06 says, &quot;Cane of the Tranquil.&quot;<br>
Nagasakee says, &quot;My most valuable possession is my reputation.&quot;<br>

I agree with jag 100%.<br>
And I want to add that, even though the majority of the server population (I hope) is going to be cool and respect others, a FFA enviroment will sooner or later cause trouble, you can be sure of that. And those little problems that may seem easy to solve and insignificant at the beginning, are just the genesis of chaos.<br>

<br>
Politics have always existed on Brell.  To deny that, or to consider earlier attempts at dealing with it as unimportant, limit our view of how the server matured into what we have today. <br>
<br>
Reservations existed on Brell very early on.  While there is debate as to when people started reserving things, I think we can all agree that at some point people felt the need to schedule their raids due to competition.<br>
<br>
The spirit of this server has been evolving for a long time.  Who remembers the discussions we had about the rights of a guild to claim loot on a raid?  Who remembers the attacks on guilds who contemplated it?  Who now accepts and encourages it by turning their head?<br>
<br>
Who turns their head when a member of this community can steal from another member and still lead a raid supported by the community?  Who allows someone to camp out in a Plane, regardless if that person intends to help his brothers and sisters out in the other?<br>
<br>
When the leader of a guild instructs its members to not adventure with the members of another guild, despite any friendship, because someone's ego was stepped on... is that the spirit you speak of?<br>
<br>
I argue, Jagriel, that this server's spirit died long ago.  Too many people, all scrambling to satisfy their own needs as individuals.<br>
<br>
When it no longer matters who you have helped previously your confidence in the spirit declines.  When you go beyond what is considered fair to help others out and get flamed for it, the spirit begins to fade.  And when you realize, deep down inside, that no matter how much help you offer you'll always be viewed as the evil uberguild, you understand that the spirit you held so high before is nothing but a shadow of your own need for self-worth.<br>
<br>
I started a guild that welcomed joining other people on raids.  We encouraged joint-ventured events so that we could keep communications with other guilds and individuals on the server a priority.  We were small, and we felt that we could embrace this server's population with open arms.<br>
<br>
Then we saw the dark side of human nature.  Independent raiders, claiming loot that they couldn't possibly attain on their own, seen regularly.  Complaints from the community that we were a uberguild, and we cared nothing for anyone but ourselves despite everything we'd done for others.  Accusations that we wanted to controll everything, from reservations and message boards, to ubermobs and other guilds.<br>
<br>
You begin to realize why a guild which is capable of doing things on their own would start to question why they aren't.  You might understand a guild's apathy for the community they helped keep fair to everyone, when &quot;everyone&quot; doesn't seem to care what is fair for that guild.  And you might recognize why a guild no longer cares what happens to the community because the only reputation that seems to matter is the honor between that guild's members.<br>
<br>
I contend Jagriel, whom I once called my friend, that this server's spirit was dead before you put words to your emotions.  I appreciate your desire to see the server return to its previous glory.  I, too, once dreamed of seeing this server realize its roots of familiarity and consequences.  However; Given the large number of people who don't or can't honor those ideals, I feel it is no longer possible.<br>

Ganon,<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel that way.<br>
<br>
I think courtesy to your fellow players is something you do for yourself, more than them. <br>
<br>
There are, indeed, a lot of rude players on this server, and no shortage of selfish or jealous ones.  Some of them you can excuse by recognizing they are young and haven't learned simple lessons in life.  Others have no such excuse and you just have to come to terms with ot.<br>
<br>
But if the discourtesy of a few, or even many, encourages you to join them &quot;to win&quot;, then you have already lost.<br>
<br>
To become what you abhor, for the sake of a few transient bits seems foolish to me.<br>

We spend a lot of time self congratulating ourselves about how wonderful our server is, but I don't see it. We have the same issues as every other server, and the same petty bs, we just cover it up in highfalutin language. And where other servers simply chose the might is right strategy we, by trying to be fair to everyone, decended into a dictatorship of the minority. One where a small minority of raiders use the rhetoric of democracy and fear of being slandered on the boards to propagate and continue a system which they consistantly abuse for their own benefit. <br>
<br>
I have to agree with Ganon, the spirit of this server, whatever it was, died out a long time ago at the hand of diminishing resources and increasing population. This courtesy that is constantly demanded of me has not been shown to me in ages. <br>
<br>
Let's look at reality. The system favors the small at the expense of the large. The large make up a majority of the raiding populace. Some of the large abuse the system by using smaller guilds and indys to whore for places in line. Some of the smaller guilds and indys abuse the system by allowing this to happen. A lot of people are unhappy with this setup, yet the people who abuse it call them the loot whores, and evil uberwhatevers out to abuse the system. Sorta ass backwards, ain't it. <br>
<br>
Guess what, our current system is unenforcable... yes completely unenforcable, and in fact anyone who tried to interfere with the raid of a guild who didnt follow our system would be warned or banned themselves, not the other way around...<br>
<br>
This means the only way a system will work is to get EVERYONE to buy into it. I said it when we instituted the original system and I'll say it now. If the system doesn't have fairness to everyone (large and small) there is no way it will fly, in the face of Verant's default FFA stance. <br>
<br>
Which means your alternatives are a system which the vast majority find fair, and will use peer pressure to enforce, or the default FFA. And in the default, a few large guilds will likely band together, form the classic uberguild, and we will be much as the other servers are. <br>
<br>
I'll likely be told im evil for even pointing this out, but that's silly. These are the bald facts of the matter. These are your realistic alternatives. I bring them to you not as a threat, but as a realistic assessment of our alternatives. You are free to decide what you think the best and worst alternatives are. <br>
<br>
Preserving, or i would say recreating, the spirit of the server isn't about self serving platitudes on fairness and just behavior. Its about recognizing reality, and finding fair compromises that people are willing to live with, or living with the consequences of failure. That's the real world folks.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

Many people, myself included, have said that you (in the collective) have a point about the reservation system.  What I haven't heard is a rational way of balancing it.<br>
<br>
If someone comes up with one that doesn't require huge book keeping, I'm all ears...<br>

But Thoric, you do reiterate some good points.  I agree that something needs to change.<br>
<br>
Vox is a good example.  I have had my eye on her for a while, since I really want a white scale to compelte my epic.  If it were FFA on this server, she's be dead, several times over, since her last dirt nap.  I would probably have my Epic weapon.  I would be happy.<br>
<br>
But what is even more important than my epic is this server.  FFA is not a good thing.  I am afraid that this server will become dominated by those that have a lot of free time.  The unemployed, unchallenged college students who don't have to study much, and other people who can play for hours and hours.  <br>
<br>
I work.  A lot of people on the server work.  I would imagine that the majority of raid capable people work during the day.  I don't want to log on to Brell one evening to find that all the fun mobs have been taken out while I was toiling away on the job.  That will probably happen if this server goes FFA.<br>
<br>
On FFA servers, a big time mob is taken out as soon as sufficient forces are mustered.  I imagine that most of them will not spawn between 6:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m., prime time for us working stiffs.  That is something to be avoided.  That would be a true dictatorship of the minority.<br>
<br>
What we have accomplished on this server is something akin to the rule of law.  The server is not governed by guilds, or by individuals, but by the respect we have for the system we have established to govern ourselves.  If we take that away, is anyone sure they can stand upright in the winds that would blow then? <p>Chants Evensong

<br>
Pick 2. <br>
<br>
You can't have all 4, its like saying, I want a Cheap Top of the line BMW. <br>
<br>
The only way to be fair is to go on a person by person basis. Nobody wants that, its even worse off then uber guild symndrome (UGS). <br>
<br>
The fairest system I can think pluasable at this time, is that people have to earn the privalage to raid something. But when you got people coming in here, saying they live on earth too so are entitled to the same thing that everyone else who plays this game is entitled to, we got people trying to get something for nothing.<br>
<br>
I don't see to many people complaining that Bill gates has all his money and wont give you any, why not? You were born on this planet just like he was, whats he entitled to that your not? Maybe its all his hard work, his knowledge, his lucky, and whatever else he did to earn what he has. Yet still, people think just because they are lvl 50, they have every right to lead the server in whatever they think they can handle. <br>
<br>
So I repeat, unless we do it on a person by person basis, regardless of guild, indy, and even level, we can't be fair to people, we are only fair to guilds and indy's who as indy's represent thier own guild respectfully.<br>
<br>
We either need an honor system, a system that lays out every law and every circumstance and gives us the correct action for due event, or we need people who decide what is right and what is wrong in certain situations (Judges).<br>

-  A person comes to this board and admits he is a thief.  He laughs in our faces.  This person can find the support for a full blown fear raid less then a month later.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  Another person comes to this board to sell a pair of ultra-rare greaves from Venril Sathir.  He used deceipt to earn them, and tried to use deceipt to sell them.  When caught he laughs at the server and then runs his own fear raid.  He of course has no trouble selling or trading the greaves I would imagine. (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  A person comes and and puts their name on the Venril Sathir list... then has another person run the entire raid with their guildmembers.. and then claims for themselves one of the rarest epic items in the game without any random or concern to others on the raid and without informing them prior.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  The first question out of people's mouth when asked to come on a raid is.... what do I get.. vice where do you want me.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  People sign up for Three different raids in the same area on the intentions forum.. and expect them all to be honored.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  People have their reservable raid stomped on numerous times.  (where were you with your spirit of brell speech in that thread?)<br>
<br>
-  Take a look at the sign-up's for raids.  Who sign's up for your Trakanon raid.. but you can't find their name on your last six hate raids.  Who sign's up for your POG raid.. but can't be found on your sky trip sign-up.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
-  A person camps their main in Fear and makes this open to all.  He still joins enough raids to get a full set of armor.. and promply leaves the planes never to return again the night he gets his last piece.  (where were you when the spirit died then?)<br>
<br>
And where was I?  Not here.. fighting for what is right unfortunantly.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for the spirit you can find it.  It is still there hidden away in guilds like the Merry Band and Zan Fi and Darkguard.  It is openly displayed through people like Justise, Ganon, Mufat, Kuanshankein, Shiki (retired ..sniff), Kambing, Rykilth..and many others.  You can even see it in people like you Jagriel (who I still care for dearly and respect beyond compare) and if I may be so bold I would suggest you can see it in me.  But that spirit died on the whole of brell.  It was erased by the greedy, the blindly rightious, and the individuals who cared about number one.  And of course our system..which ran off goodwill... was like Disneyworld for these people.  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry Jagriel.  People like you and me are a rare breed on this sever now.  I wish it was better.. but it is not  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
jagriel : nice post as always<br>
<br>
ganon :the same way you think people are not fair toward SR, you are yourself not fair toward independants and smaller guilds<br>
not all people have something against SR, some admire your guild<br>
personally i'm somewhere in between (i know too many people in your guild to consider it like a solid block)<br>
even if you've lost hope, is it really a reason to give up acting like you've always acted ? and to turn your back to what you believe in ?<br>
for every asshole on the server, i can name you 1 awesome person, and 8 others as pessimistic as you are, and yet wishing things would get better<br>
<br>
thoric :as always you pull this sma rethoric trick, accusing others of doing so<br>
the fact is, if you put together SR, ensh, LoH, and watchers, you dont even come close of half the 50+ population of the server<br>
instead if justifying your point, you cry about a minority controling the server and doing what they want<br>
it's too easy when someone is asking if growth shouldnt be reservable to post about the lack of freedom, that people want everything reserved..<br>
the truth is, noone, and i do mean NOONE wants everything reservable<br>
but the reason why we started reserving the planes and some other zones still holds true today<br>
if you dont organize the most raided places, only the powerful guilds will have fun in them<br>
that doesnt mean at all everything should be reserved, if you look into our system, currently only the old ubermobs and 3 zones are reservable<br>
out of what ? 25+ zones where you can raid<br>
if you want to defend your thoughts that nothing should be reservable, be my guest, but please stop justifying it by fake reasons<br>
<br>
chants : as always, reasonable and well-tought post<br>
<br>
justise : just steal the freaking car ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
your analogy is kinda biaised<br>
of course gates could buy more stuff than all of us together<br>
rbut outside of our respective houses, i can go everywhere and do what i want with who i want, and the same thing is true with him<br>
he will have more choices because he can afford more stuff, but if my lousy car or his limousine is parked somewhere, well the other wone be able to park there<br>
<br>
sindarre :as far as i can remember we've disagreed on a lot of things, today we only disagree on half of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
of course there's a lot of bad stuff going on on brell, always had, always will<br>
but honestly take some time to compare the new high level players and the old ones<br>
some of the new are just lame, but was it perfect when we were younger ?<br>
you can name belaiel but at the time we had wombastic<br>
you can name whatever-is-his-name(girru i think ?), but i think it was fengar who ebayed his char right after getting the druid staff<br>
<br>
for me the only thing that changed is the number if people, we have a lot more people on brell, and sharing with them means lowering what you had<br>
more people also leans more assholes, and this gets to everyone as well<br>
it's just not a reason to forget all the awesome new people<br>
<br>
it doesnt please me to have to rely on sign ups and praying to go on raids, i would love as much as you do to be summoned for CT, phinny or whatever<br>
<br>
but it will never be the same.. just have to swallow it, and share with the new guys like you shared with the old ones<br>
after all it still leaves a lot of zones available only to the few with enough fire power to raid them <p><BR>

Your own actions speak for themselves.  Many Guilds honor and RESPECT intentions Watchers Abyss LoH Elysian.  Was it demanded no but freely given because thats how we have always worked.  Blackisting as you say Ganon well i have to say only blacklist is the one you create and no one person can tell there guild a certain group of peopel are Blacklisted wont happen and never has in any circle i been in.  Thoric learn that your not the only one on this server.  Sindare on that post you quoted me on in game i like how you forget to mention when i said that you came back with a /nod and btw Jagriel HAS ALWAYS BEEN there promoting all those beleifs and working for them i have seen it in his Guild meetings and The Events his Guild Runs.<br>
<br>
You wish to bash Jagriels post why is that?  Nothing was offered to help further his goals or try and support them you have given up.  That is the failure there you do not want or dont care to help promote what he has to say but Many Others do and for that the Few who wish to see the server become there own play Ground will never be happy or those that wish to see it die.<br>
