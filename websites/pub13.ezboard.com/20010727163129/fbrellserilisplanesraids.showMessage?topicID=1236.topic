I'll give this a week or so and then try to hammer out a consensus to vote upon.  A few of the things to thing about and comment upon here.  My feelings at the present time are in the next post.<br>
<br>
Is POG reservable?  Or will POG posts be &quot;intentions&quot; only?<br>
<br>
Should we have a separate forum for POG?<br>
<br>
Can more than one &quot;raid&quot; be in POG at a time?  If so, how do we go about dividing up the plane amongst multiple raiding groups?<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of for now...thanks in advance for your input. <p><BR>

<br>
I think POG should be handled like the other planes.  To wit, lets make it reservable.  <br>
<br>
And I've come around to the idea that maybe a POG raid forum is necessary.  If we decide its a reservable plane, then this is a moot point and we'll have to have the forum anyway.<br>
<br>
As for multiple groups, what I'd like to see is something along the lines of posting for sign ups like this:  &quot;My guild is going to the POG on the 20th, and we'll be in this section.  We're willing to share the plane that day if you're interested in taking some other area.  Contact me in game to arrange it.&quot;  If some group wants to try to clear the whole plane, they would, of course, say so in their post and it would be theirs for the day.<br>
<br>
Just some ideas..... <p><BR>

Sure it Should Be reservable.  <br>
<br>
Now the hard Part  So what Part of PoG do you Want Caster Loot or Tank Loot?  The Way its Set up you can do for either But Not Both if you want two raids and keep everyone happy (different mobs drop the bp/pants/arms items).  You will have to Go North to the Water Fall for Caster Loot Thus Clearing alot of the Lesser Mobs or By Passing Them to a Nice SS with Invis or such.  Then you Can Go South Clear Around the Break In Portal And Then Head to The Lake Staging Spot.  Or you Could just Do the Easy break in Mobs on the West Side of The River and Let the Next Raid do the East Side.  Just State What your Going after would be Ideal.<br>
<br>
Just Remeber its a 29 hour spawn time give or take and hour.  Plus when you do say Ali or Greenroot(i think thats his name) they summon a certain type of mob to help them seems it agros all those mobs in the zone onto anyone KOS.  That could be nasty for the other Raid so make sure you keep people informed.  <br>
<br>
Will post More Info Thursday When we go at it Again.<br>

<br>
29 or 30 hours, give or take.<br>
<br>
That means if a raid on Tuesday starts at 8pm EST, there can't be a raid for Wednesday.  There would be no pops to kill, unless the Tuesday raid left a lot of pops deeper into the zone.<br>
<br>
It's going to get complicated trying to reserve something that has a spawn timer that would create such ackward scheduling times.  I'm all ears for any ideas. <p><a href="http://pub32.ezboard.com/benshadowed">

<br>
I seriously seriously doubt that the Treants that summon their friends can even be attempted without clearing the rest of the zone first.  Nillon tried pulling Greah, and got about 6-8 lil poglings on him as well.<br>
<br>
I'd say there should be 5 general types of raids you can do on POG.<br>
<br>
1.  West side of river, doing all the ponies, wolves, bear, and kodiaks, with the occasional pull from across the river as well such as feral amalgams and totem looking men (someone nicknamed them tiki men?).  This is the easiest raid, and can easily be done with a raid of 18 people with no rangerscouts.  I know it can be done because I was with Tanix when we cut a b-line from the zone in to the river and killed everything inbetween.  The toughest fights are the 2 pogs, or the names mobs<br>
<br>
2.  North end of zone past waterfall.  Here you pull a number of phase pumas, tiki men, and some feral amalgams.  This is probably the most dangerous pull spot in zone, as the wandering treants cut a path straight through the pulling grounds.  We did manage to avoid any aggroes in the 3 or so hours we were there yesterday.<br>
<br>
3.  South end of the zone past lake.  Here you pull a number of brownies, tiki men, green wisps (in color, not in /consider), and feral amalgams.<br>
<br>
4.  Treants.  This is one probably the biggest undertaking of any raids on the server, barring western wastes and dragon necropolis.  First you will probably want to clear #1.  I don't know for certain that you NEED to clear #1, but it might be a necessity.  You would then need to clear most/all of #2 and #3.  The reason for this is that these trees summon all mobs of a certain type to their aid.  If you don't clear #2 and #3 of these particular mobs they summon, you die.  If your goal is to do Treants, you will probably need to do Nillon's raid idea, by having 2 simotaneous raids one doing #2, the other doing #3, and combining forces afterwards to tackle the Treants.<br>
<br>
5.  Tunare.  Basicly, you need to clear the plane.   I forget who did it, but someone &quot;upset&quot; Tunare one time during a raid.  It freaked out a large number of mobs in zone causing a quite camp out.<br>
<br>
I propose that zone sections as listed above be reservable, as opposed to reserving the entire zone ala POF or POH.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I propose that if you schedule a raid based on one of the above, that you cannot schedule it if it will prohibit a previously scheduled raid.  For example, if I were to book #1 for a Friday night at 6pm, no one would be allowed to book #1, #4, or #5 for any time after Noon on Thursday the day before.  #2 and #3 would be quite allowable though because they don't conflict with each other.  If someone is actually booking #4 or #5, they should talk to the previous raid booking to see if some alternate arrangements can be made, perhaps working together in some way.  Basicly, you can't book something that will prevent a previously booked raid from occuring properly due to the 30 hour spawn time.  We can get along nicely on this server when it comes to bookings.  Let's try to do so.<br>

<br>
If the spawn time is, indeed, 29 hours, I think we might want to actually STATE what days are reservable (Ie: Posted raids are permissible on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays...be careful that your Sunday raid doesn't infringe on a previously scheduled Monday).  If not, a prohibition on saturday raids might be in order.  The reason being that there are three &quot;prime&quot; raid days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  As they're sequential, a saturday raid eliminates both friday and sunday with a spawn time of 29 hours.<br>
<br>
Another option would be to cycle the plane East/West/East/West...and depending upon where the cycle stands, you get whatever mobs are up?  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure of any of this really...that's why I'm relying on all of you for assistance. <p><BR>

<br>
Stuff East of the River is consistantly red to level 56, with mostly the POGS beign white con, and some of the stuff blue conning, but high blue I hear.<br>
<br>
You need more people to hunt east of the river.  It's just plain harder.  You also should have some scouts as the zone becomes very hilly, obscuring your vision of nearby mobs, as well as dodging the wandering treants.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't make it so that you can only book it on alternating days.  That will artifically block some raids that could otherwise occur.  As long as the break in of one raid is 30 hours before the next raid, there shouldn't be problems with bookings.  You should be able to get about 2 raids on #1 for example for every 3 days of play.  If one raid starts in the afternoon, and the next one starts in the evening, you leave the next day blank to reset the spawn timer.  Only under worst case scenerio should there be one raid every 2 days.  Under absolute best case there would be 4 raids every 5 days.  That won't happen, though, because people don't organize raids at midnight, and even fewer at 6am.<br>
<br>
The zone is big enough to dissect it into 3 different mini-raids.  There's #1, #2, and #3.  It would be quite possible to have all 3 of these simotaneously occur at the same time.<br>
<br>
We'd like to get as many raids in the zone as possible to allow.  I think my idea is simple, yet efficient for allowing many raids to happen.<br>
<br>
-Choose which of the 5 raid types you wish to do.<br>
-Book that raid type on the forum with the time you will be doing the break in.  The time is very important as it will affect an entire raid booking in the following day or two.<br>
-You are not allowed to book anything that will prohibit other previously scheduled raids from occuring according to plan.  This rule is mainly to remind you of the 30 hour spawn time in the zone.<br>
-As for how to handle Tunare bookings, she shouldn't be done like Cazic or Inny.  I'd say she should have a rotation like whatever is used for the other major boss npcs like VS or Dragons, but to be mindful of other raids planned if attempts at taking her down are to be done. <p>=============================

While Juujuu's idea sounds possible it is just a huge amount of work on Zesty and I can just see the bickering that is going to happen.   Lets just stick with intentions for now.  Its working right now why can't we keep it going until there is a problem with it.  Most everyone doing PoG right now is of the 55+ crowd and works together fairly well.   Before we go through all this political garbage that will end up being drug out in numerous threads about how to set up reserving this plane why not just leave it as it is.   Its not broke so don't fix it.  <br>
<br>
Just make the forum to make it more convenient for others to see what is going on in PoG at what time.  If things start getting to where we need to set up rules then lets set them up at that time once we know what problems need to be settled. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaerendorshadowbride.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerendor Shadowbride</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/yslaine/pics/skull.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/14/01 3:58:38 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://perso.wanadoo.fr/yslaine/pics/aerendor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PLANE OF GROWTH -- Discussion and Ideas please</span><hr size=1> One solution is to  alternate (Europe+ far from US) hours raids with US raids... it would help player from any Geographic location to have fun in PoG and would limit the counter prb.<br>
(for Example: Day1 PoG on schedule at 11am PST, Day2 PoG on schedule at 9pm PST.. and so on)<br>
<br>
and Yes i think making PoG  53 or 54+ is a good idea, it will help lower levels to get experience in Plane raids, it will prevent a lot of people being on alt lists for PoG, and it will manage to keep interest for everybody to go in planes (lvl 47-53 in Fear/hate for first armor set, lvl 54-60 for Second armor set).<br>

<br>
Thursday Night: Cleared Zone in side of zone to stream.  Took them about 7-8 hours from what I heard.<br>
<br>
Friday Night: Zone in side was empty, minus a few repops.  Moved North along wall to the stream, crossed the stream and moved west till we broke out of the trees.  Pulled Totem men and kitties.  Moved back to zone in side and killed repops later on.  Drops: War Helm, Shaman Helm, Mage Robe.  All I can remember<br>
<br>
Saturday:  Zone in side was empty due to Friday Nights raid killing re-pops.  This time we moved south down to the lake.  DMFed everyone and crossed the lake and pulled wisps and totem men and were going to do brownies too over there.  Drops: Monk legs, Cleric Legs, 2 spells<br>
<br>
Sunday: SR Raiding, Zone in side should be near full pop for them.<br>
<br>
It would appear to me that as Juujuu stated, we split the zone into areas.  <br>
<br>
1) East Side: Zone in Mobs<br>
2) NWest Side: North wall west of stream<br>
3) SWest Side: South wall west of stream<br>
4) Named Treant<br>
5) God<br>
<br>
If someone reserves the 1 2 or 3, then that Area can not be reserved for 2 days from start of raid.  If I reserve 1) East Side on Friday, then it won't be reservable again until Sunday.  <br>
<br>
4 and 5 would take a huge multi raid undertaking and coordination I think.  You would want to start clearing a fully popped plain to ensure you know all is dead and nothing is going to pop on you at last minute.  But 3 raids working together with the goal at the end being killing the Named Treants and Tunar would be plausible.<br>
<br>
Although 4 and 5 could probably be considered one raid.  If you have the fire power to take out the named, I'm sure you will want to attempt Tunar. <p><b>Redspine Bladeslinger - 56th Myrmidon</b><br>

There will always be something for the raid to kill.  No one at this point in time is going to be able to clear the entire zone.  If we start breaking up the zone into areas to reserve its going to end up being a mess.  Why do we need to try and schedule and reserve everything in this game?   You just showed that we had 4 raids that all found something to kill and everything worked out fine.  WHY do we need to change it?  Whats next?  Reserving areas in Sebilis???<br>

A combined force or large scale raid would be needed for Tunare yes but thats about it so far.  Till we get More info on the Prince it shouldnt be to hard to kill the other named with a single raid of 30 if done right.  Just takes Tactics is all and a trying of something new.  PoG isnt hard at all for getting good drops the only hard part is having a few raids work together to take out Tunare. <p>Maya Shadowdancer<br>

I haven't been in the pull group, so it was hard for me to keep casting vision on nillon as he pulled to &quot;explore&quot; the zone, plus the spell is laggy as hell.<br>
My alt only dinged to 42 last night, so I can't use him yet to explore the zone.<br>
I figured that you would need more than the regular raid side (ie 2 raids) to do treants based on hearsay on how much stuff is left in the zone after the 2 raids on Thursday and Friday, and based on Nillon's observations as puller.<br>
It could be possible to do some treants with a single raid group of 30 or 36.  The thing is you have to clear all the stuff they summon first, which is big task in itself. <p>=============================

Well when Nillon Agrooed good old Greenroot(sp) 5 Sylvan Protectors Came to help Abuse us.  He only Hit in the 700's (which isnt bad on a slowed mob lets hope we can slow him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Before that he Tried casting on Nillon for a Good 2 minutes it seemed Before attacking him.  Bonus There was no Silence spell (lets hope it styas that way) and the End of The raid only had 22 or so people left.  I really Beleive we can do him with 30 of the right class lvl combo easy enough.  <br>
<br>
Ali is a Bitch But SR almost Got him with 24 not being Ready for his Dam AE Silence spell and Summoned Minions.  Im willing to Bet if they had known about it and Planed for it they could have taken him down.<br>
<br>
So Ali Summons His Little Plant Buddies Correct?<br>
Green Root Summons Sylvan Protectors.<br>
<br>
Take out There Minions and Kill POG's Before your Charge it should be viable to take these 2 mobs Down with a 30 member Raid Crew. <p>Maya Shadowdancer<br>

Let's setup another forum for PoG... something Like Plane of Growth (Intentions only).  I think we are still in the stages of learning the zone.  The 29 to 30 hour spawn time will make it difficult to schedule and moderate.  I'm up for coming up with some kind of plan.  But while we discuss it, it would be nice to have that forum available.  Plus it may help to determine how it should be setup in the future by simply setting up the forum now as an intentions only forum.<br>

<br>
I would think it is fair to say that a PoG raid should state what side of the river you wish to camp ( east or west side ).<br>
<br>
This way due to the repop rate you can do 2 raids at once but East side should always come first to allow safe passage for the West side raid. <p>Sheiba Darkheart<BR>

There Limited to only the the smaller mobs and lesser drops with just the few name spicing things up.  A South/North Seems More Viable for once you zone in you can do the Tank Run and Head North then east across river for tank loot Heading South of Port in is Caster Loot.  Doing some experimenting Later on Thursday WIll laet all know how it goes. <p>Maya Shadowdancer<br>
