<br>
YOu have made an impact on my EQ life, he he.<br>
<br>
Acting on your post on Kedgekeep, I levelled up from 44 to 51 in kedgekeep.  I am not sure about the xp vs time ratio from 51 onwards and wanted to find out if there are other zones or camps that can give even better xp.<br>
<br>
Also for a bit of variety rather than playing EQ for lvl 44 onwards only in Kedgekeep, ~smile~.<br>
<br>
Grateful.<br>

The Hole has a similar ZEM and I think the front mobs *might* be doable and are pretty good xp, but that's more popular as a solo spot so you might have more problems finding it camped.  Not that big of a deal when you have a druid to port you elsewhere though.<br>
<br>
Burning Woods was another popular spot with my guild, there are undead mobs and it's easy to pull singles.  Not sure about how they match up against your levels but it might be doable.<br>
<br>
Another spot I used to PL my druid up to about 51 was the area just outside KC in DL, I pulled the drolvargs at the entrance and whatever other blue mobs I could find in the desert area outside.  More train potential there, but again usually easy to pull singles and the mobs aren't that hard.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing there are similar spots in Luclin, I just don't know what they are, I'll leave that to those who have explored it more extensively and are closer to your level.<br>
<br>
My guildmates did make fun of me for living in Kedge.  Of course, now some of those same people are still working on making 60... <p><BR>

However the temple area is still decent, not great, towards middle and back, there are still plenty of blue mobs. In fact mobs before the castle support up to 55. At 55 too many turns light blue, you have to move up into the castle itself to gain decent xp in CoM.<br>
<br>
Oh did I forget to mention, if you are lucky, there are some nifty loot drop randomly in CoM. Mine druid level partner and I got 3 trance sticks and a number of other loot. Mine first worth while loot in EQ. I was never the type to camp green stuff for loot. Mine idea is always xp and loot, CoM fit this very well, least for me that is. When you get a bit higher there are other places more profitable and better xp waiting. <br>
<br>
BTW lguk are good place for paladin from early 50s, you can single pull almost everything and low hps UNDEAD mobs. I leveled myself on and off from mid 30s to mid 50s in lguk, undead side. Now I know the place like back of hand. You just gotta learn how to handle additional adds sometimes, think of practicing crowd control skill for sebilis.<br>
<br>
CoM is almost always empty or with few people, if your partner is a druid, travelling there is no problem and it is outdoor as well, so SOW. Enjoy it while you can, it is one of mine faviout dungeon.<br>

You have good suggestions already....Just adding some recommendations and added insight:<br>
<br>
My roommate and I generally duo only (shaman) and we add in friends when they are around and on at the same time.   We prefer to pick a spot, and be able to log in, hunt for 1-3 hours, log out and not worry about having to travel.   Generally, we look for places we can have a guaranteed camp, and not have to fight over anything.   Given that:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Kedge keep</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- Floor 2, camp / base in Golden Mermaid Hallway.  Once you go up the tunnel, it turns to the left and then to the right.   Fight right in that corner there, nothing wanders by you, totally safe to camp in, and easy to pull to once you get used to it..  Great zone mod, good xp till 55<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Grey</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - You should be able to go here.   Zone in, go north, just south of the corner.   There is usually a small group or druid kiting in the corner.   Pull only the skeletons and snare / fear kite them.  tons of mobs, not a problem.  Learn to watch for Rock golems and the little sand fires giving signs of worms.  Good xp, fear kitable<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Scarlet Dessert - Skip the Platuea</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.   Zone from Twilight, Head LEFT.....1/4 of the way around the zone is a VERY little used Reaver/ Revanent camp.  should be Solid Blues for both of you.  Pull with stuns and you will get single pulls every time.  5 are in the camp, and named can pop there.    Kill cheetah's and sandcrawlers if you kill all 5 in the 22 minute respawn.  Good xp, not great<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Burning Woods</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - There is a little used nook that has NO roamers near it.   Sadly, I don't have the loc on the top of my head.   If you are at the Giant fort, go north.  It is around 3500, n200 or so.    There is this long flat little platue between hills on both sides.   Very safe to camp here, very easy to pull here, and all solid blues to hunt.  so, so xp mod<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The Hole</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Invis past the entry hall.   You will be frustrated with it since it is VERY often camped, and you don't want to have to travel.   Go to the drop off (since you have a druid).  Always Camp on top of the ledge just at the drop off.   Pull to there as well.   You might get an occasional 2 pull, but after pulling the area around there for a couple days, you will learn it well and know when and how to pull.    Druid should have Lesser Succor memed at ALL times.   Problem?  Succor, you end up at the zoneline without agro, invis and run back down to the drop off.     Rarely do people go past the drop off, so you will have no competition.  Good xp mod.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Timorous deep</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Some competition, but kill the bird things.....raptors I think they are called?   On the ogre isle.  there is a probably chance there will be a quad kiter here, so that is a possible problem, but safe to camp, easy to get here, not risk of wanderers, aside from what gets trained on you...blue/light blue - so so xp<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sol B</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Fight down to the zoneline through Sol A (very easy).  Zone in near the LDC's / Bats / guano harvester.   You might get lucky on a drop.   Nice attributes is you are next to a zone if things get hairy, you can zone to camp, and once you zone, you can walk away and take care of your kid, since unless it changed, there is no mob at the zoneline in sol A.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wakening lands</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Set up camp near skyshrine.  I think the tigeraraptors are blue to you maybe light blue.  Should be able to pick on them for a while.   Otherwise, head around the zone to the left, following the wall.  Send druid out to pull, and kill what you bring back<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> skyshrine</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if you don't care about faction, you can kill the guardians in skyshrine.  I have never done it, but shouldn't be a huge problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are some more ideas for you.    Aside from Luclin (the grey &amp; scarlet) I would suggest you stick to Antonica and Kunark.  The biggest advantage to those areas is the mobs are not nearly as tough, and generally you can avoid people and not have to fight for a camp.<br>

Just buff your MR to avoid the stuns and you should be able to do well there with your combo.<br>
<br>
The SolA side of the zoneline is indeed mob free should you need a quick escape to attend to your child. When I was fighting in that area, I would often camp out at the SolA zoneline, that way if I had a spare hour and wanted to kill, I was already close to the mobs and didnt lose time to travel. As an added point it is close to a druid port ring should things go very wrong and you need to get back, and there are food and water merchants nearby (gypsies) to get supplies from or sell any gems you may come across.<br>
