<br>
Of course every human, no matter who they are, deserves and is entitled to basic human rights.  I also believe the extent of those human rights is based on several variables which for the most part may be beyond any sphere of control that the UN might have.  Thoric's description of the UN pretty much sums it up, the UN is like a boxing arena we choose to have our political fights in, but in the end what a super power does in its territories is its own buisiness (with obvious exceptions).<br>
<br>
That being said, support for the war will not last forever while no one is fighting us back.  If we are not able to draw a state sponsored connection to these terrorists, then eventualy support for the war will crumble under the weight of political rhetoric and financial concerns.  The processing of these captured terrorists could be our last opportunity to create a major impact in the middle eastern region for a while (at least until the next terrorist attack... hey it sucks, but history does have a way of repeating itself).<br>
<br>
I think Nillon's questions is one that has more relative importance than most might think.  These prisoners being processed are our last chance to obtain intelligence, remove potential terrorists, and to make a strong political statement to the world about what our agenda is and to hopefully strengthen our coalition (a strong reason to treat them well).<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this because this is the way I'd like things to be.  Unfortunately, I'm a much harder person than that deep down inside.  If I had my way, we would process captured terrorists in Afghanistan, those not found innocent and set free would work off their time in Afghanistan by rebuilding the roads, homes, and buisinesses.  But that's not realistic now is it...<br>
<br>
I would be less worried about human rights violations going on at the Cuba base (I'm sure most violations happen long before they reach Cuba anyways), and more worried about the ones that still exist on a day to day basis in other parts of the world.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long email.  I hope everyone is doing well in the game and out.  <br>

But so far not even the US Supreme Court has been given the chance to rule. In this case I would say that the US SC would not be an appropriate tribunal to determine whether these are PoWs, given that it is associated by the Detaining Power. The only ruling that has been given was by Donald Rumsfeld, presumably after discussion with the Pentagon and the White House, and that is not acceptable.<br>
<br>
I think we're arguing over the details of very similar points of view, Thoric.<br>
<br>
Danni - there's nothing wrong with a good political discussion, and it's made all the better for frank exchanges of views. I don't see any flame-bait here yet! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As I've said, it's not the present camp conditions that worry me, it's the obtaining of information and their trial and sentencing that I'm concerned about. If Milosovic can be tried in an open court for his crimes, so can these people.<br>
<br>
I share the views that there are far worse Human Rights violations worldwide, but the case remains that this is supposed to be a war between the civilised world and terrorism: if the so-called good guys are making up the rules as they go along (and to suit themselves), the moral high ground is levelled dramatically.<br>
<br>
I disagree with what you say about what happens within a country's own borders: (cue the obligatory 'Hitler' reference) in Germany in the late 1930s to early 40s, millions of Jewish men, women and children were murdered. The perpetrators that were caught were eventually tried and convicted for these crimes. There is a difference between the UN (or any individual nation) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> choosing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not to take action against horrific acts, and actually condoning the acts. Nobody's going to invade China because of Tienamen Square, but it didn't stop the international outcry.<br>
<br>
It is precisely because America can do more or less what it wants that is the reason why it should act as a beacon of international respectability. If it descends to the depths of &quot;what are you going to do about it?&quot;, then America becomes simply a terrorist state with bigger funds and a larger army. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uizdaari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izdaari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 614<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/24/02 5:50:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=599.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.everlore.com/GFILES/UserPic8748_2528.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: do subhumans deserve human rights?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;If it descends to the depths of &quot;what are you going to do about it?&quot;, then America becomes simply a terrorist state with bigger funds and a larger army.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
No, not a terrorist state, an empire. We're well on the way there, which raises two questions. Can the process be reversed? And should it be?<br>
<br>
I see three likely alternatives: a competent empire; a incompetent empire, that will never be able to admit to itself that it is an empire; a return to a republic.<br>
<br>
I prefer a restoration of the republic, but failing that I prefer a competent empire to an incompetent one. But I fear the incompetent empire is what we're likely to get. <p><B><I>Izdarre</B></I>,<BR>7th lvl Elven Eldritch,<BR>Dia Sepia of Evoluxa,<BR>Percival - DAoC<BR>

<br>
You are correct about the UN by itself being powerless.  I should have made that clear in my post.  My point was that it actually has significant power inside the US because of the treaties having legal meaning through which the government can be subject to legal action.<br>
<br>
All it takes is the the US to breach those treaties and the government/military can be dragged through court and end up invalidating any evidence that may have been gathered from the prisoners - all of which would need to be used in a criminal trial at some later stage.  Even worse, the courts could demand the government set the prisoners free without trial for improper arrest/imprisonment etc.<br>
<br>
I'm just saying that these people not only deserve to be treated as humans, but should actually be treated with kiddy gloves to ensure that no spectre of impropriety can be cast on who is in the right and who is in the wrong.  The government and military are not above the law in the US.<br>
<br>
My greatest fear at the present time is not that some of these petty terrorists escape, but that the balances detailed in the consitution will be usurped in a fervor of paranoia and suspicion.  It worries me when Time magazine and others post editorials on how measures like national ID cards would help matters when these terrorists who flew the planes into the WTC were legally inside the US and would have had the same ID cards as every other legal alien.  Honestly, I actually don't have too much against an ID card, it just won't prevent terrorism.<br>
<br>
It worries me when I see laws passed that allow me to be imprisioned indefinitely without trial on suspicion of being a terrorist.  I'm a legal alien.  I use a boxcutter at work.  I enjoy flight simulators.  Maybe I should just hand myself in right now?  <br>
<br>
Is the US still the land of the free and the home of the brave when laws are passed restricting freedoms out of fear?<br>
