Antontica, Faydwer, and Odus. You have the ability to gain the ultimate level of 50! When you become great, elite, and experienced, you may travel to Nagafens Lair, Kedge Keep, Permafrost, and many other dangerous zones. Dragons, Nagafen and Vox, rest in their heavily guarded lairs! With incredible equipment that they posess! Blah blah blah and other cheesy stuff that sounds like Verant made it up.<br>

Dragon bone bracer 2-3k drop off Lady Vox.<br>
Gaunts of fiery might 4-5k drop off Lord Nagafen.<br>
Hitting level 60 doesn't make you uber, it makes you another face in the crowd.<br>
Some drops in the great lair of Old Sebilis are given away to newbies.<br>
Runebrand girdle sells for about 20k.<br>
Some level 60 characters have level 60 'twinks'.<br>
How commonly do you see someone with their epic?<br>
How commonly do you see a level 60 character?<br>
How commonly do you type /who all, and more than half the list is in Temple of Veeshan?<br>
----------------------------<br>
~Ok ok. Im not complaining. But I have played Everquest for quite some time now, I have enjoyed it and still do. But don't you find some of this information, kind of weird? I used to have an ultimate desire when playing Everquest to gain level 60, now I kinda just wanna hit 55 so I can go on ToV raids.<br>
Jeez am I the only one who feels like we are going in circles? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
There is no more balance in Everquest anymore. Maybe I am just a little too obsessed with EQ, but I can't help it. There is no point in hitting 60 except for going on raids! Newbies don't even beg for bronze and banded armor anymore. They beg for like Antontica quest armor WHICH I MIGHT ADD used to be really prized and hard to obtain.<br>
I just feel like Everquest has lost its normal touch, and there isn't really a point in playing if you are under 40.<br>
<br>
But like I said I still love Everquest and I love to play it, I just think this is an issue <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorchacohen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SorchaCohen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 842<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/17/02 10:23:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rodden.net/webgfx/sashield60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Our server, and an issue not very widely known</span><hr size=1> As computer games go, EverQuest has not only exceeded the expectations of the manufacturer in terms of popularity but I think it has also exceeded the industry's expections in terms of longevity. There are very few games that can boast 400k+ users three years after their release.<br>
<br>
I think it reasonable to expect a certain amount of evolution to occur after three years. Learning Norrath has been much like learning a new neighbourhood. When you first move in you're wandering around looking lost and gawping at all the new places and after three years you're comfortable there and wander around like you own the place.<br>
<br>
We'll never have the same sense of awe and wonder that we did when we first started playing. I can still remember being stuck by the eldritch beauty of the underground lake and surrounds in Ak'Anon on my first visit. No place is going to give me the same amount of wonder as my expectations have been raised and acclimatised.<br>
<br>
To get that feeling again, you need to go to a new game. A new world with a new map, new story, new races maybe but the current suite are fine. There are many bugs, features, interface mechanisms and balance features that can't be changed due to them being coded in too deeply. A new game could address those also. I would love to see EQ 2 come out. There's a good chance that I would buy it and play it for another three years.<br>
<br>
PS: I generally find that newbies don't beg. They're normally too busy trying to figure out how to stop getting killed by orc pawns or princess klakniks. The beggers are the ones that already have a char or three over level 10 and are greedy lazy pricks. <p>Sorcha Cohen<br>

Many people are under level 10, and extremely well kitted out.  It is very rare that people under level 50 ever use the stuff that they loot off the mobs.<br>
<br>
No drop items which drop off the lower mobs, are not that good.<br>
It is in my own opinion that I would like to find a server with all items as no drop.  That way people with the items they have, will actually deserve it.  That said, there will always be the peope who will protect teh noob to a higher place and kill the mobs for the &quot;twink&quot; to gear up.  But in a No Drop world, twinking would be less common.<br>
<br>
I admit that I am using some items which are far beyond what I should have at my level, but that is mainly so that I am able to compete with the other characters out there.<br>
<br>
Also, it frustrates me that when you are legitematley getting something for your main character, and you are prevented from doing so by another persons twink, I get really disapointed.  Myself going to all of the effort to complete something by myself, for my character to use, having that chance stolen so that someones 2nd, 3rd, or even 8th character can be better than anyone else.<br>
<br>
The only way in which I am able to get some items which are maybe a little better than the twinks, is to do the questing.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, a combination of a bad day in RL and a bad day in EQ can lead someone to say some stupid things.  I appologise to those people in Crystal Guardians who I may have offended.  I did not mean what I said, it was a sudden, uncalled for outburst. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7920<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/18/02 2:43:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/craig234/eq/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /agree</span><hr size=1> It can be frustrating, so don't worry about it.

Apart from all the humming and hawing which we don't need to get into here, one of the primary complaints that kept potential subscribers from joining was the transfer policy. Think they would've had alot more people join on had it been fresh.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you are pretty well stuck, I know what you are talking about because I've tried starting over on a couple different servers at various points... simply trying to rediscover what I liked about the game.<br>
<br>
An enormously-strict rules server would be a nice challenge, but I really don't see it happening. Still would be twinking though... just like back in the day with a half dozen lv1 warriors sitting at the zone in solb wanting to loot painbringer and the other @#%$. <br>
<br>
Don't think half the people who posted here even read the whole thing.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhowlyr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Howlyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 6:21:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/thegathering74069/images/sword3_e0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Twinks in groups</span><hr size=1> I wish I could have played back in the old days, but I was in the Navy when EQ came out and spent about 75% of my time at sea, clammed up inside a Submarine.

&quot;trickle down&quot; gear is everywhere.  Just to give an example - when was the last time you saw a newbie in banded?   A long time ago - because bronze (I'm deliberately disregarding other nice gear here) is so common, its cheaper per AC than banded, which is a pain because it requires smithing.<br>
<br>
How many people run around, at double their encumbrance, because the FS weapons that are dropping are too valuable to destroy?<br>

Yaks, that used to be THE WEAPON, are now junk, because their ratio is &quot;only&quot; 1/3 <p></br>

I remember when i heard there was a zone with hillgiants and was afraid to go there at level 35.   I remember looking around for things to kill at 35 and zoning around with my friends Wolfrunner, Sharkann and all and looking for hillg iants in zones like NK, and WC just for something to kill.  I remember huge trains in PAW with the gnolls casting charm on the warrior.  I remember Highkeep and fighting over spawns in the guard room and warrior rooms..the day being made by getting a spot in a group in highkeep for the evening.<br>
<br>
I remember hitting Kithicor at night....just to get exp....because every place else was crowded.... (pre kunark)<br>
Never saw twinks, they didn't exist.......and a FBR and Oracle robe were the best in the game.  Full quest armor was awesome.<br>
<br>
i knew the game had changed when i went to Blackburrow on the way to Perma one day........and saw all the level 10 twinks in armor and equipment better than i had at level 40.....sigh.........there is no challenge in playing twinks, one demystifies the entire game in a single decision.  I knew on that day when i saw that Enchanter level 6 in a FBR that the game has taken a turn for the worse. <p><img src="http://www.swordoffate.com/images/sigs/Cherianna.gif" border="0"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarodar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darodar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www2.netdoor.com/~ddeas/GrBounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/20/02 1:20:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.keepersofthefaith.org/images/KTF_medium.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Norrath of Old</span><hr size=1> There is not some kind of &quot;conspiracy&quot; to use prexus as a test.  Prexus was the next server in line to be split when the user base for EQ leveled off.  This caused VI to re-think the splits because the normal business model shows that the number of users start to decrease dramatically after it levels off and they didn't want to waste money on a split server if both servers were going to end up underpopulated.  Then the expansions came out and there was more room for everyone to play so splits were discontined.<br>
<br>
I agree that Prexus could use a split, not because we are overpopulated (3k people is not that much when you consider how many zones there are in the game now), but because most of these people are crammed into the same zones because they are all level 60.  Don't hold your breath though. <p><blockquote type=cite><blockquote><HR align="center" size="2" width="50%"><center><b><font size="4"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24683">Darodar Steelstorm</font><font size="3"></a></br>Human Warlord</br><i><a href="http://www.keepersofthefaith.org">Keepers of the Faith</a></i></font></b></br><HR align="center" size="2" width="50%"></blockquote></blockquote></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showMessageRange?topicID=966.topic&start=21&stop=30>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showPrevMessage?topicID=966.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showNextMessage?topicID=966.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=966.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.threadControl?topicID=966.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=966.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=966.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home<option value="prexus95980frm22">Neverwinter Nights</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
