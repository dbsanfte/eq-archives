<br>
All this flaming about people wanting KEI.  Its understandable that they want it.  The real problem is the idea that your time is theirs to spend how they want.  I dont think there is a buffing/porting class out there that doesnt have that problem.    <br>
<br>
Now the only thing we need to get people to understand is this.   YOU have the right to charge what you want in an attempt to dissuade them from bugging you for buffs.  Some will pay some wont.   The whole point of charging so much is that you really DONT want to be bugged when not Role/Anon. <p><center><img src="http://thack.net/tetree1.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadaxwrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adax Wrax</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1276<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/18/02 9:05:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1240.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bsc.net/dbaldwin/adaxhead.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 100pp for KEI update</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I could be charging you a 100plat because that's what it's going to take for me to spend time to crack you rather than go change my dieing grandmothers diaper.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
And a lot got that money with no help from anyone, ie guilds etc.  They saved for it.  So I can't really blame them for wanting to make it back.  Eventually 90% of level 60 enchanters will have the spell and the cost will go down.  I wonder how many are without the spell now.  I think enchanters should refuse to pay that much but heh, that's me. =/<br>

I was actually done with this rant from the initial post, but I thought some of the responses were soooo completely off-base that I should clarify.  I now realise that it wasn't a matter of clarificatoin.  Some people just have difficulty grasping certain concepts.  I'll try to clarify one last little bit... and then I'm done :&gt;<br>
<br>
I wasn't rude in the initial replies.  I said ~I charge 100plat for KEI~.  They then proceeded to be extremely rude to me.  Not a very hard concept to understand there... or at least I thought.<br>
I did not provoke a reaction out of people who asked a favor.  I told them my price.  It's not an un-reasonable price, but some didn't like it.  They felt it neccessary to attack me for the price I was charging for their unsolicited request.<br>
I don't fly off the handle when anyone says anything other than ~I'll pay 100plat~.  I fly off the handle when I get personally attacked because they didn't like my price.<br>
I'm not biatching because I bought a spell.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I'm complaining about how some people feel that they deserve for me to spend my mana, time and effort, giving them buffs at a price they like, regardless of whether or not I have the time, mana, or inclination to do so.  When that didn't happen, they got violent. THAT is the complaint.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I was also helped as a lowbie now and then.  I also return the favor quite a bit.  That wasn't the point.<br>
If you feel that doing things for others &gt; all, then great.  I spend time helping others when I feel like it.  I've done a huge amount of selfless things for various strangers.. when I wanted to.  You can feel free to spend your entire EQ time helping everyone but yourself(don't exactly see how'd you get past level 10 though).  Heck, give me a list of people who feel this way.  I've got twinks I'd like to get power leveled.<br>
I'm not scraping for attention... the entire post seems to be about me not liking the attention I'm already getting.  I guess that one flew by as well.<br>
As far as not liking to hear me ~whine~, then why'd you read my rant? That is what a rant is, you know.  Someone whining about something they don't like.  Another difficult concept, I guess.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I suppose I screwed up when I assumed people would comprehend the subject matter. I really didn't think it was that difficult.  Congrats to those people who actualy understood the rant.<br>

<br>
That in itself is clean and simple, and I don't think anyone would dis-agree with that.<br>
<br>
I don't think the remainder of his post is really justified since it is HIS personal opinion and rational.<br>
<br>
So....Some one asks.... he gives a price... result, trade / no trade.<br>
<br>
There are Three simple options here...you give KEI and 100pp better off, haggle... or move on.<br>
<br>
a) The trade speaks for its self.<br>
<br>
b) Move on and simply don't waist your time on a lost cause and do something you believe to be constructive with your time.<br>
<br>
c) Haggle, do you REALLY want to *SELL* KEI or are you having *fun* in the discussion / argument that ensues ?<br>
<br>
What ever the motivation, I would say if it bothers you that much I teake option b) and move along.<br>
<br>
What I don't think comes across very well Terrenoth is your outlook on the game in that YOUR time is king. <br>
<br>
I would hate to meet someone like that in real life. Hell if I was bleeding to death on the street and didn't have $100 in my pocket ... would that person let me die.... I very much doubt it....<br>
<br>
I just think what you have posted hasn't come across very well. Many people, which I am sure you are one of do a very great many selfless acts, some actually enjoy this, where as others are too wrapped up in there own selfish gains to even batter an eye lid as to how they can make the game a more enjoyable place for all.<br>
<br>
What comes around, goes around, don't think how you can help... JUST do it, and one day, you will be stood in awww at just how wonderfull the world really can be from a few selfless acts.<br>

1. I always offer to donate 50-75pp for KEI in ooc.  I rarely send someone a tell unless they are next to me casting it, so I know that they aren't wrapped up in something else.<br>
2. I'd gladly pay 100p for it if I was in a hurry, or on my way to a mob or situation where I knew that I really needed the manna regen to pull off whatever we were doing.<br>
3. I believe you have every right to charge 100p or 200p or 2kpp for casting KEI.  Whatever the individual wants to ask is their choice.<br>
4. Playing a buffing class, and being bugged for 40 levels for SOW, Heals, and every other shammy buff under the sun, I know it can get bothersome sometimes.<br>
<br>
That being said, you are still a douchebag.<br>
<br>
I wasn't going to reply to this, until I noticed that one of the original people that you posted about is someone that I know pretty well from in-game.  I've known Tunaris for over 20 levels know, and know him to be one of the most polite and helpful people in the game.  While I'm not going to canonize him or anything, it's obvious that he was able to state his opinion without dropping to the level that you did.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Tunaris tells you, ' I can afford you, but I won't...but I now charge at least that for ports for anyone in Legerdemain.... and I used to have friends in your guild... sorry for wasting your time'<br>

Sorry, but you are the ignorant one here.  You said your price, the person didn't like it and let you know that. Touche. You started with the childish name calling.  You're the dipshit in my book.  Perhaps you should KEI yourself before you post in hopes that the added intelligence and wisdom will help you see what an ignorant fvcktard you come across as before you hit the &quot;post&quot; button.<br>
<br>
Go ahead and say that you are being attacked if its makes you feel any better.  But it's obvious to anybody with half a brain that read your little rants that you're the juvenille throwing the temper tantrum.  You are seeing what you want to see.<br>
<br>
Again, I don't chastise you for charging for your time/manna/whatever.  You have every right to do that.  I think you are dick because you are the one that took the conversations from civil to insulting.  It's ok for you to set a price, but it's not ok for somebody to disagree with it.  <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;unsolicited tells&quot; bullshit, you can blow that one straight out your ass.  I play a buffing class too, and I'd be willing to bet the rent money that over the course of 42 levels, I've had about 20x the requests for SOW alone than you have had for KEI.  Same for Druids and Wizards, same for Clerics.  I'm no saint, I've said no to people when I couldn't stop what I was doing to give them a full round of buffs -- but I never used somebody asking at the wrong time as an excuse to go off on self-righteous/how dare you/have pity on me pontification.<br>
<br>
Cry me a river of tears that a buffing class gets asked for a buff.  If it bothers you that much, start a warrior and quit your bitching.<br>

So it's okay for me to go around asking melees to come kill things for me since they're a melee class and I'm a buffing class.<br>

Your friend also responded that's what he'd charge for porting people in his guild from now on, which has nothing to do with the person selling KEI.  Sounds a little overboard. <br>
<br>
Besides, if he's charging for ports he shouldn't be upset at other people's prices for buffs.<br>

<br>
This is a bane, that will never go away.<br>
<br>
When my wizard was a noob, I never knew what Clarity was, let alone KEI.<br>
People that bug me for KEI won't get it, one thing I *hate* in Norrath is people spamming me with tells about how they cant live without it! Deal with it, its not about money, its a mana/time thing.<br>
<br>
Pet peeves? I have those.<br>
Druids/Wizards who beg, plead for KEI, and tell me they are poor and cannot afford much (I dont charge) who I then see /ooc'ing or /shouting in zone, Porting to all locations for donations/PP amount.<br>
<br>
Don't lie to me, I'll know.<br>
<br>
Don't give me the 'I KNOW it can be cast on a lvl 23, a chanter cast on me the other day'<br>
BS! its a GROUP spell, and unless we are grouped with you....<br>
<br>
I'm changing how I cast it, no longer will random tells help your case. <br>
Friends, Guildies, and the odd person who actually impresses me when they ask will get it, I'll still do random drive by's ..ask the guys in Highpass yesterday, I was working tradeskills and decided to buff the zone...<br>
<br>
Spam me, inspect me.. bug me.. forget it.<br>
<br>
Ohh and Maddie, you should hear Melee bitch when they ask for speed, and I click Shissar on them, they seem to think they have a *right* to VoG. And they do ask, a lot. <p>Narye L'Stager<br>

You feel you need to charge for KEI, that's your choice.<br>
<br>
---end quote---<br>
<br>
I for one should feel the need to 'charge' (I do it on donation basis only) for KEI because of how freakin much the damn spell costs.  I get at least a hundred or more tells a day asking for KEI, and I usually oblige if the person comes to me (donation or not).<br>
<br>
A pet peeve of mine out of these KEI beggers is when they are /role or /anon.  Not much pisses me off more to have a roleplaying or anonymous druid or wizard send me a tell for KEI (I never go anon or role) when they are anon or role so they don't get singled out and spammed for ports (which they just did to me by asking for a KEI).  I hardly ever oblige these persons.<br>
<br>
And hell, if you want KEI, do NOT expect me to come to you.  I've gotten some pretty nasty tells because I wouldn't service someone where THEY were, when I'm the one that spent money for the spell (and my debtor, still in debt for the damn thing) and it's MY mana that is being used, as well as MY time medding that mana back. <p><P><center> See my crappy gear </P><P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122472"> Normal </A></P> <P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122496"> Resist Gear </A></center></P>

One thing I wish to point out.  If your a person (all classes), who offers a service for a donation.  If you must use the word "donation", why not add "minimum" before it and a minimum amount after it.<br>
<br>
That way the person giving the donation doesn't have to guess what number you will accept without getting all bent out of shape.<br>

Never seen him charge for a port, nor for a rez on his cleric.  Seen him cancel the trade window numerous times when people asked.  I'm sure he's accepted donations before, but I've never seen him ask for them.<br>
<br>
RomaCafu: I suppose that you are insinuating that I believe Tunaris was flowers and sugar in his response. No, I don't.  His opinion was strong, he stated it without name calling, yelling, etc, and went to move on.  However, chanter in question was clearly in the mood to instigate a fight at that point, took the first below-the-belt shot, and has admitted as such in this thread. Face it, any contradictory reply that came back was going to be met with a hostile response from chanter.<br>
<br>
Alliara: both casters and melee's need each other is the point that I was trying to make with that comment.  We choose a character to play a certain role.  When I play my shaman or druid, I expect and receive a billion tells for buffs or sows or ports....it goes with the territory. When I play my warrior or ranger, i know that different things are expected of me.  Nobody gets to level 60 solo, or without some help along the way and we all benefit in some way from the other classes in the game.<br>

Even tho KEI is a rather new spell, I highly doubt it.  I get spammed from when I log on to when I log off, no matter that I'm in an AE group somewhere or exping in Cazic Thule, peeps still send me tells for it and want to come to me for it.  I'd estimate that in a 10 hour session I get 80-125 tells for KEI.  Usually one or two ever 5 minutes or so.  Where as you get SoW at what, before level 15, keep in mind that sow takes 40 mana to cast too, 4.5% that of what KEI costs to cast, so I cannot cast it on everyone, just simply can't do it. <p><P><center> See my crappy gear </P><P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122472"> Normal </A></P> <P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122496"> Resist Gear </A></center></P>
