There is no rain, no hate, no fear, no fire, no justice, no war, no happiness, nothing, without her. Without her there is no love.<br>
<br>
Tunare. The Mother. It is to her we all owe our existence, for it is from her that we, and everything around us, is born. Life and all its beauty, all of its majesty, all of its trials, all of its pain, is a gift from The Mother.<br>
<br>
Why then do my own people, the people who instilled in my heart and soul the teachings of The Mother, outwardly despise me for calling a dark elf my sister? Why do they shudder in horror when I can truly say I love a troll? They applaud me, heap rewards upon me, and call me a hero when I take life! I was raised a healer. From my youngest days I had a knack for healing the wounded and tending to the ill. I worked long years in the temple before I was finally permitted to leave the walls of Felwithe alone. I've travelled to many places and seen a million things. I've found beauty in them all. . I’ve tried to heal the world’s ills in my own arrogance. I’ve tried to heal many wounds while ignoring my own. Well no longer, here is what I’ve really learned. I learned the blessing of sacrifice from a young paladin of Qeynos who gave himself so many could escape the plane of sky. I learned the wisdom of justice from a barbarian in the cold everwinter of Halas. I learned and understood the tennents of war from a warrior doggedly determined to defeat his enemy, even at the cost of his own life. I communed with nature thanks to the teachings of a druid. I learned that everything isn't always what it seems from an enchanter. I found the beauty and harmony in music from a travelling bard. I learned the cleansing power and dangerous beauty of fire from a mage. I spoke for hours with the wizards of Erudin on the arcane. I found beauty in its intricacies and destructive power. I've hunted with a ranger, and he showed me how to take the scenic route, to better fully enjoy one's surroundings. He also taught me the impossible is possible. I learned how beautiful death may be from a necromancer, who showed me that even in pain and death, there is beauty and life. I've spoken with ogres, trolls, dark elves, and even iksar. All the people that the rest of the world automatically hates. I've found that they have their own culture, their own values, and whether the whole world thinks they're wrong or not, they don't understand, they're just doing as they always done, and in their mind, they do right. These people are intelligent, they have their own values, their have their own culture, their own social structure, their own languages, their own feelings. It is THERE I found the arrogance and folly of my own people. These people have hearts, I have seen compassion from them, and I have seen them love. I have seen the hate suffered unto these people by the other races. I've seen them butchered just for the color of their skin and the values they uphold. Just like the way they nearly butchered me for the color of my skin, but what saved me is my values, the things YOU taught me so hypocritically. Is it really any wonder they hate us? No, I think not.<br>
<br>
You taught me well, but perhaps, for you at least, too well. I found myself afraid once, and through your teachings we learned the children of Tunare should never fear. The Mother would always shelter and protect us if we keep our faith in her. I actually wondered at one time if it was my faith that was faltering. No, it wasn’t. It was my faith calling me to inspect my own values, my own ordeals. I was afraid of our “dark kindred” at one time, and that’s the woe that society had placed upon my heart. It was a prejudice from my own society that kept me from a greater understanding of the world around me. Through the strength of faith I faced my fears, and found that I really had nothing to fear. I just didn’t understand. Thanks to the arrogance of my own people I had been running from new and exciting experiences. I’ve made friends, some close enough to call sister.<br>
<br>
While I am still not welcome to visit their cities I feel that it is OUR responsibility to pursue this endeavor. I believe it is OUR responsibility to open our hearts and show them the wisdom of The Mother. Show them that all people are loved and valued for who they are. If you do not join me in this crusade then just remember me the next time you're in front of a sword wielded by one of our &quot;dark brethren&quot;. Remember that its your fault, and the arrogance of our people, that you're about to die. For not embracing them and loving them as The Mother would.<br>
