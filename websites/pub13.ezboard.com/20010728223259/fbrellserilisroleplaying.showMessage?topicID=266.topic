It was a relentless down pour. The night sky erupted with lightening and the resounding boom of thunder. It had been many years since a storm like this had fallen on the land of Norrath. It was a dark storm, a storm that only a few had seen once before. And those that still lived knew what came with this unholy storm. They knew it was a reminder of the prophecies yet to come.  <br>
    The thunder rolled within the swarthy clouds gathering slowly as the winds howled through the trees. The waves of the waters pounded against the shores. And as the thunder reached its deafening climax a hale of ligthening poured from the sky into the ocean. Where the the largest bolt cast its shocking touch a figure emerged from the dark waters. Her deep blue skin glistening in the illuminating energy that flowed all about and around her. Her white hair clinging to her face and neck.  <br>
    &quot;I have returned&quot;  she hissed between her lips. She slowly walked from the cold waters, steam raising from her body, she made her way on to the shores. Her mind flashing back to the past week...<br>
<br>
    &quot;You ARE Nbygrh, you ARE Teir Dal! There is no greater glory then serving the Father's Will!  You ARE the Sword of Innoruuk! NEVER forget this! Do not fail your family, your destiny! &quot;<br>
    These words echoed in her her head as she was left by Laucian Nbygrh in the wilds of Velious to fend for herself. She was left nothing save a few morsels of food, the cloths on her back, and her sword. She had been sent on what she thought was an escorting assignment for the family. She soon realized she had been sent on one of her father's many tests of devotion he was so known for. He sent her here to test her faith, her devotion. She was left in the arctic night to find her own way home. Were it His Will she would survive, were it not she would perish like all the weak ones before her. She was not weak, she would not fail, not falter again. <br>
<br>
<br>
    She took a deep breath. It was good to be home. Good to feel the soil of her homeland beneath her feet. She tread swiftly through the city unseen by any. She longed to see the House, but not the the estate that housed her families estate, it was House Ka T`et she made her way to now. And as she made her way deep into the heart of Third Gate, past the city's boundaries she smiled coldly, her ice blue eyes fixating on the ebony walls that loomed in the cold darkness  ahead.  <br>
    As she entered the enormous blackened double doors of the House she was greeted only by silence and the undead guards who patrolled the halls. She walked in silence down the halls peering down each. Not a sound. She finally found herself in the Hall of Innoruuk standing in the Meeting Hall. It was here that they planned their battles and posted their conquests. She searched about her for signs of upcoming calls to battle, or past ones revealed. She saw nothing. She frowned at this, not one sign of a hunt? Had the Royal Advisors not made plans? <br>
<br>
    &quot;We live for the hunt, you and I. We live to do the Father's Will. That is the purpose of true Teir Dal. Do you serve the Father's Will? Are you truly the Sword of Innoruuk?&quot; a voice hissed in her ear. She had been traveling for many nights, only resting durning the day. Her food supply had exhausted days ago, and although she did not like to admit it she was utterly lost in this icy tundra. She had fought many battles within the past days and was weary. And as she spun to her feet drawing her sword she wondered who dared to awaken her from her troubled dreams this night. <br>
    Her eyes met the gaze of an unusally large  black dire wolf. It appeared to be grinning at her. It's red eyes glowing in the darkness of night. <br>
    &quot;Look at you, you have not even lived your first century. You are but a child! You are no Sword of Innoruuk!&quot; the wolf cackled. <br>
    &quot;I shall show you who is the Sword and who is a mere fool..&quot; she hissed at the wolf.<br>
    &quot;By all means, please do, child.&quot; the wolf stepped forward changing shape as it spoke. No longer a wolf but a woman, a Teir Dal woman. &quot;Show my Father your true nature, child!&quot;  the Woman shouted. <br>
    She wasted no time in her attack. The Woman rushed forward whirling her sword at unholy speed towards the young Knight.  The young Knight manged to avoid the blow and as she swiveled around she cast her own thrust of the sword. The Woman dodged it. Their swords clashed, the sound of metal clanging filled the air. As the Woman kicked the Knight back she began to gather magikal energy about her. The Knight soon became aware that they were of the same ilk. She rushed forward knocking into the Woman, breaking her concentration, knocking her to the ground. The Woman only laughed as she landed, rolling she spun  back to her feet. The Knight began to cast darkness upon her assailant. An icy laugh flew from the Woman's lips. <br>
    &quot;Nice try young one but I have many years on you. You are no match for me.&quot;<br>
    &quot;We shall see &quot;  <br>
    The Knight advanced on the Woman, they fought for hours each throwing devasting blows upon the other. Each drawing on the devine energies the Father provided them. To the Knight's dismay, although her blows were steadfast and powerful she barly seemed to injure the Woman. She had started this battle weak, and found herself starting to fail fast despite her best efforts. Once again their blades locked and they stared into one another's eyes. The Woman grinned with a horrid coldness. <br>
    &quot;You are injured badly, child, you have grown weak. I have the upper hand. Where is that bravdo you fight with now? Where is that cry of fury you are known for now? Give in child, you are no Sword!&quot; <br>
    The Knight glared back into the Woman's icy blue eyes the rage building within her. Drawing on all she had she pushed away from her advasary. She raised her sword and let out a battle cry that curdled the blood. <br>
    &quot;I AM THE SWORD OF INNORUUK! HIS WILL SHALL BE DONE!&quot; <br>
    She rushed at the Woman, thrusting her blade into her but not before the Woman's blade met her own flesh. She felt the searing pain of fire within her gut as she leaned against the Woman. <br>
    &quot;Yes,&quot; the Woman smiled coldly, &quot; you are the Sword of Innoruuk. You have a long road ahead of you child. Let the fire of Hate that burns within you this moment be eternal. Do not forget it, do not falter, we shall meet again, when you are more then you are now.&quot; she leaned closer to the Knight, and kissed her on the lips. A rush of frigid air rushed through the Knight's body. &quot; Do not forget... Dezmona...We ARE The Sword of Innoruuk.&quot; she whispered in her ear, &quot;His Will shall be done..&quot; <br>
    When she awoke she found herself emerging from the dark waters onto the shore. Her things layed out before her, waiting for her to reclaim them.<br>
<br>
    Dezmona sat before the desk in front of her. Taking out a peice of parchment she took a quill in hand and wrote : <br>
<br>
                    I have returned.  His Will shall be done...are you prepared?...<br>
    Taking her dagger she pinned the note to the wall, and gathering the shadows about her made her way out into the stormy night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=268.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=262.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=266.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=266.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=266.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
