A young soldier stopped in front of me and saluted.<br>
   &quot;The Tier'Dal have broken through our second line, and have taken the west lift.  We managed to cut that lift off howerver, so they cannot get into our city as of yet.  We are running out of time though.&quot;<br>
   I looked over the battlefield from the treetops of my home town, Kelethin.  Part of the greater Faydark was burned down, victim to vile magics, from Tier'Dal and Fier'Dal alike.  I whirled my staff above my head and lightning struck a small group of dark elves that had gotten too close to the lifts.  They were flung in every which way, dead to be sure.<br>
   &quot;Order for the rest of the lifts to be destroyed, they must not get into town.&quot;<br>
   &quot;But sir... what about our people fighting on the ground?&quot;<br>
   I spared another look at the battle. the Tier'Dal overwhelmed us five to one.  I could see people i knew from my childhood.  Old friends as well, all fighting down there for the elves of the Faydark, possibally for every living being in the world.  A tear trickled from my eye, but i denied any emotion.  Crying was for after.<br>
   &quot;They are already dead.  Do not question me, soldier.&quot;<br>
   For a momment he seemed in a blind rage and panic.  &quot;But sir... my father and brothers are down there.&quot; <br>
   &quot;Better to only lose a few than the whole thing.  I'm doing what must be done.  Send the order soldier, or I will have you sent down there with the rest of them.&quot;<br>
  He stammered, eyes darting wildly.  &quot;Alexeus, what happened to you?  Can we at least adress each other as the friends i thought we once were?&quot;<br>
   &quot;I'm sorry, Arthedian.  I guess I am not a very nice person anymore.&quot;<br>
   He tooked a few steps backwards, and then coldly saluted.  &quot;It will be as you say... sir&quot;  He invested some scorn in the last.<br>
   Suddenly, the line of Tier'Dal fell back, they were playing defensively now.  Were we really winning?  That thought was brought to a painfull stop.  The dark elves were enveloped in a blue light, then lashed out with increbible speed, ripping through the lines.  A large rank of robed Tier'Dal appeared over the ridge in the distance.  Enchanters, Magicians, Wizards, and Necromancers.<br>
   &quot;Destroy the lifts NOW!&quot;  A ball of fire flung from my hand, engulfing a lift.  It cracked and fell to the ground in a burning heap.<br>
   &quot;Archers! Go for the casters!  They die just as easily as anyone else, but are much more dangerous if left alive!&quot;<br>
   That was for sure, an army of undead had joined the enemy ranks, surley conjured by those necromancers.  Balls of fire rained down on the city.<br>
   &quot;Soldiers get the fires out!&quot;  The archers were lined up at the edge of the city.<br>
   &quot;Draw!  No need to go for a killing blow, only shoot if you know you can hit! Make them incapable of casting!&quot;<br>
   I raised my right hand above my head, a ball of fire formed above it.  I flung it out at the casters.  &quot;Fire!&quot;<br>
   I heard someone echo my words, and as the cloud of arrows rained upon the Tier'Dal casters, enemy arrows dropped a good portion of the Archers.  The Tier'Dal still had casters, our race of elves did not have the mind copacity to learn the fields such as they could.  We were doomed.<br>
   &quot;Damn the High Elves for refusing to help!  Damn them and their snooty, self centered, arrogant ways!  Do they realize they will die too?!&quot;<br>
   I staggered as if hit.  What was i doing here?  I am just a Druid, just a Druid!  I was blindly leading a war, and destroying nature's creations as we speak.  How did i fall into this?  I had no right to be called a Druid!<br>
   &quot;Sir... the lifts are secured.&quot;<br>
   I looked over the Greater Faydark.  No longer a forest, but a battlefield.  I could have done better.<br>
   &quot;Our troops on ground have been all but slaughtered, we need a plan to escape.&quot;<br>
   My eyes picked out the corpse of an old friend, his dead eyes seemed to stare at me, accusing, asking why.<br>
   &quot;Sir Arthedian went down to help.&quot;<br>
   I saw Arthedian, perhaps the best friend i have ever known.  I watched as he held three enemies at bay, and watched as another came from behind and drove a sword through his back.<br>
   &quot;Sir?&quot;<br>
   I spun to face him, he took a step back and saluted, head bowed.  He must have seen the fire in my eyes.  My fury melted.  No reason to be angry at him.  Be angry at myself.<br>
   &quot;Gather everyone that is left in the city here. we are leaving.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Y-yes sir!&quot;<br>
   Momments later everyone was gathered around me. so few it was.  I began my casting.  A sound like a roll of thunder rang out into the air.  I looked over the battlefield...my home... one last time.  At the people who I was leaving, sealed to their fate against the Tier'Dal.  One of them saw me and saluted.  A corageous man... he knew he was going to die. blue light enveloped me and everyone around, i was alone now in this blue universe, with the sensation of moving.  How did i get caught up in this?  I looked back on past memmories, and closed my eyes...<br>
