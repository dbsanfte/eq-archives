I've been in two guilds for a grand total of 3 months total in my entire EQ lifetime.  I now have 6 characters 51+.  I couldn't give a crap about epics (have none), TOV, whatever.  I've never been to the planes, I've never seen an indoor dragon (Vox/Nag/Trak) and don't care if I ever do.  I play the game to have fun.  To level my toons, get neat new spells and to accomplish things that are within my ability.<br><br>I left Brell because I was sick of all the constant whining and in-fighting and backstabbing and cliques.  I don't recall ever taking part in any of it, but it sure was disheartening to see the same people whining and complaining about the same old stuff day in and day out.  Just because I never took part in raids here or there doesn't mean I didn't visit brellserilis.net everyday to keep on top of events.<br><br>My current server is NOTHING like some of you paint FCFS servers.  Dragons / Planes are not farmed.  Co-operation between guilds / groups of players is night and day compared to Brell.  If I wanted to go on a Hate raid tonight for example, there is a 99 percent chance I could attend one - if of course there was one planned by anyone.  If one wasn't planned, even a complete planer newbie like myself could raise a couple groups of experienced strangers to go by sending a few random tells.<br><br>I could go on, but it's very apparent that those who foretell doom and gloom by saying &quot;Check out a FCFS and you'll see how lucky we are&quot; have no clue as to how a FCFS server operates.<br><br>And yes, I still come back here to read the Brell forums once every couple of months or so.. partially to see if I recognize any names and to see the downfall of the lists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=BEBEBE>Nillon the Champion</font><br><font color=red>Brell BoTB Winner</font></span><br>  Posts: 2391<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/02 3:57:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Yeah</span><hr size=1> Exactly.

I played there for about a year. (moved here I believe in Jan of 01 forget off hand)  They had this one guild initials SA i cant remember what it stood for.  About 3 times bigger then SR in numbers not sure how levels would have compared when I left Lanys.  But basically they were the servers &quot;uber&quot; guild.  Well guess what, lanys atleast at the time was FCFS on everything.  Guess why I hate FCFS?  SA controlled the server.  Someone (I think Twiggie but I cant remember and dont wanna sift through posts so sorry if it wasnt you Twiggie) stated in one post that why would the ubers need money by farming any items let along Trak BP's.  I dont know, I dont know why SA needed to do this either but they did.  They had a person (I remember the name well, was malden) who was obviously a shared account or someone with 0 life cause by everything I could tell and others he was sitting in EC about 18-20 hours a day.  SA would farm everything there was to farm and take it to him to sell.  They literally controlled every mob there was in the high end game.  Nothing was taken without them being involved somehow.  I played on lanys for about a year before moving here because a RL friend kept bugging me to change, i was getting fed up with EQ and wasnt sure if it was the server or the game that I was fed up with so I gave Brell a try.  It was different at first, I didnt really even like it at first to tell the truth.  See on Lanys because the end game was so unplayable for the extreme majority people would get to the high 40's get sick of the BS and make an alt.  Literally there was this huge community of sub 40's that had been playing the game since beta but never moved to the high end game so they all worked very well together and welcomed n00bs like me in warmly.  On Brell the low end game is a bit different, a large portion of it is high end players alts who typically expect anyone they group with (for the few that either have to or even choose to group) to know the game and their character in and out before lvl 10 so it was a little harsh for me for a while because even though I knew my bard from playing one on lanys (moveing chars wasnt an option then of course so I started fresh) I was by far no expert.  Anyway got through that crap and got to the near high end game and found this board.  Ive been visiting the board for many months I just dont post often to answer Twiggies question in another thread about me being a newcomer.  I didnt know what to expect from the high end game here, I never got there on Lanys just saw all the crap SA did and such but when I found hte board, imagine what I thought when I saw reservations for the planes, for dragons even?  OMG it was beautiful, for atleast a decent part of the first stage of the end game there was no uber guild dictating how the game would be played, how loot would be distributed, and who could kill what mob.  I have seen how bad FCFS can be, and seeing that I can never imagine believing FCFS could be good.  All the equations of guilds doing mob x then moving on is great in theory, and maybe even would work here, but it didnt work on Lanys when I was there because one guild wouldnt allow it.  This is why I vote reserveable, this is why I believe Trak will be farmed, because I have seen it happen.<br><br>Reako<br>55 Bard<br>Dracaena Arcanum <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhikaruichijyo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hikaru Ichijyo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AI OBOETE IMASU KA?</span><br>  Posts: 933<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/02 10:56:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/cgoebel5/sig/ico_Hiksnickers.jpg Width=100 Height=174></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeah</span><hr size=1> Ow that chunk of text is one incredible eyesore.

Simply because the boards are mostly run by people in the &quot;uber&quot; guilds.  Of course the boards would be run by those people, they are usually the ones tht have been around the longest so it only makes sense, still doesnt lessen the fear some have.  Personally that didnt weigh into my decision on the subject, it was totally made up from both lanys and the KSing I have seen on brell in smaller zones like lguk, KC, and others.  I will say that even in KS situations the higher levels tend to handle it much better then the lower levels.  That is highly due to the fact that the lower levels arent as organized and every part of the game is a struggle for them.  It was for me, took me over a year to reach 55 (though I did take a 3 month break, and a 1 month break in there when RL caught up with me).  <br><br>As for the big block of text, I am a 3 draft writer and I dont apply that to boards because, well its just a board so I go pretty much complete freeform just typing whats on my mind.  <br><br>I will say to all the smaller guilds, lower level peoples that SR/W couldnt even compete with the no longer existing SA on Lanys on the @#%$ level.  SA would have never been on a PoG run to snipe at Tunare and allow the other raid in the zone to roll on the drops of the mobs on the way.  No drop or not they would have let them rot.  (the last PoG raid I did eons ago)<br><br>I still believe FCFS will hurt the smaller guilds but oh well FCFS will win and we will see how it works.  I only wish a solution other then FCFS would have been attempted to be discussed (in this round, may have happened before I dont know) as I think something other then FCFS could have been arranged to allow the bigger guilds to get their keys while still allowing the reservation system to stay in place, and even work smaller as the bigger guilds only want the keys, if something could have been arranged to get them the keys the wouldnt have needed to be on the list so the list would have shortened making it not so long for the guilds that are after the other loot arent waiting so long for their next kill.  The problem here is we have polar oppisits debating an issue and that always leads to  bad feelings on both sides.<br><br>I am actually sorry I took part in the debate, I think some of my posts stirred up more emotions then may have been if I had just posted my vote and left that at that.  For that I apologize to everyone on both sides of the issue.<br><br>Reako<br>55 Bard<br>Dracaena Arcanum <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukulanaesoulsease.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulanae Soulsease</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 844<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 1:34:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://web1.noment.com/dsummers//EQ/Kulanae6.gif height=158 width=119></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeah</span><hr size=1> The discussion has come up many many times before.<br><br>Believe it or not I was pro-reservation for a long time.

Then I began to see inadequacies in the system.....especially as it applied to larger guilds.  I also saw rampant greed enter into the dragon rotations with people claiming dragon loot for themselves or their guilds. I tried many times to foster change in the system and hit a brick wall of nay-sayers and protectionists at every turn.  This is what started me down the path to FCFS advocacy.  But what really pushed me over the edge was Velious.  Kunark had helped....especially Gore/Talendor/Sev but the 2 biggest encounters were still reserved (VS/Trak).

When they no longer work I am also a full believer in change.  <br><br>When the European/Japenese stuff came up.  I was on these boards almost 24/7 and in chat with people who wanted changes.  Seliya, Adune, Twiggie and I all sat and offered changes to make the board more fair for everyone... Which is what you all say you want when it effects Trak or any other mob listed here.  But all I heard was that making it more fair to Europeans and other time zone players was out of the question.  They were a minority on the server and the majority shouldn't have to change for them.  At that point I realised that no one cared whether resrevatons worked well, just whether it worked well for them.<br><br>I still support the system and I will continue to support the system as changes come to it.

If I think somehting is not working well I will outline why I think it is not working, but also respect your views. <p><center> Kestri Evensong<br>Bard of the 57th song</center><br><center>We are the muses<br>Goddesses of the arts and proclamers of heroes</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uddraknfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ddrak NFyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 231<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 10:19:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeah</span><hr size=1> Not wanting to dredge up ancient history, but why did the Euro/Asian guilds need help with dragon kills?<br><br>I would have thought they would easily have had first shot at any dragon given the time zone differences?

ET just totally lacked credibility. <br><br>Most of the changes they asked for were just ways for them to clear the planes two days in a row and increase their chance of named mobs, as we would have seen had they been made. <br><br>So I think using that as an example of people being selfish may be correct, but not the way you seem to imply.  <p>60 Warlord<BR>Silent Redemption<BR>It's what happens when mimes recycle!<BR><BR>ICQ#-105127301<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39557" TARGET="_new"><IMG ALT="Click Here to See My Stuff!"

There isn't some great conspiracy.  If SR/W or Ensh/LoH wanted to do something, who would stop them? No one. Everything they do is done without needing outside help.  Oh, well they would be scorned and not be respected because of it... pffft.  Have you read all the crap that those 4 guilds take on a weekly, if not daily, basis?  <br><br>Hell there is a post here today accusing SR of &quot;stealing CT&quot; when the poster has no idea who killed CT, as well as the fact that CT is not a reservable mob.  SR/W and Ensh/LoH get ranted and @#%$ on more now than they ever would if they just did what you all seem to think they would do without reservations &quot;stopping&quot; them.<br><br>Other guilds on other servers don't apply, you can't compare the two.  SR/W and Ensh/LoH have shown more than enough times they are very willing to work things out and compromise, not just with themselves but anyone else.  Last AoW attempt Ensh/LoH did, if I'm not mistaken, they waited HOURS for the guild that wanted to kill Statue to get set up, take a long time for Vindi, take even more time for Statue.  They could have easily rolled over the other guild if that was their true nature, but it wasn't.  So please stop saying that is what they will do without reservations.  Cause not only is it untrue but you have nothing to base it on. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=maroon,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>Jaradin Stormcaller - Warlord in Training - Ally of Kael Drakkel<br>Twiggie Tymberwolf - 52nd Wanderer - Friend to Dragon and Dwarves<br>Brell Serilis Server</font></table><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21764">Stats and Gear</a></td></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uddraknfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ddrak NFyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/02 2:18:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yeah</span><hr size=1> LoH/E (which is the correct way to put them?) are uber evil!
