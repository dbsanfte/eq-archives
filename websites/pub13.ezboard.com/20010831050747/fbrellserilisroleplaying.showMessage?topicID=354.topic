<br>
<br>
<br>
The heavy scent of decomposition and fungus wafted out of the tower's entrance door, with a long, winding spiral stone stairwell heading downward. The steps were slippery and wet with moss, and each step was a risk of it's own. Her leather boots worked thier way down the elevation of stairs, and finally sunk into the deep muck at the bottom, blackness all around. <br>
The absense of light was no problem for her elven eyes, and the only sounds were the soft breaths of air she took in, vainly breathing through her mouth to avoid the acrid stench of urine and filth.<br>
<br>
The bottom of the stairwell was instantly lit as she cast a simple spell to illuminate the area, revealing three prisoners, sickly thin and malnurished. Thier sunken eyes and worn faces lifted up to greet thier captor, more so in trying to discern her face than anything, but the mask she wore was obscure and dark, even absorbing the light she cast into the room.<br>
<br>
Various insects crawled off the bodies of other dead prisoners as she stepped closer to the three live ones, and a few creatures slithered away beneath the floor muck. Chains rattled as the prisoners craned thier necks to see the face of the tall woman, thier arms already limp from being held above thier heads for so long, the blood had stopped pumping to thier now white hands and fingers.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's time for you to see what the cost of your betrayal is&quot;, she spoke  in a soft but malicious tone, &quot;and although you do not know me, you know what your fate is, so I'll save you the lecture. Besides&quot;, she continued, &quot;it's much more fun to see the looks on your haggard faces as we perform the ceremony.&quot;<br>
Thier eyes twisted in horror as clouds of shadows erupted from the walls and gradually formed two slender men.<br>
Dark elves.., one of them thought to herself. Necromancers, no less.<br>
They both pulled down thier cowls in unison, revealing thier white hair, and with a few blinks thier eyes began to glow the insidious red that was common to many dark elves when thier nightsight took over.<br>
Kneeling down together, both necromancers began to chant in unison, and soon the gaping maw of an elven skull arose from the floor, then two clawed hands thrust upward, pulling the rest of the body to the surface. The skeleton stood nearly six feet tall, but seemed much more intelligent than a standard undead servant usually summoned by necromancers.<br>
Two dim blue lights flickered in the pits of the skull's eyes and it's head began to turn, surveying the prisoners. It's mouth opened as if to speak, but only a hollow, wispery voice came, and the sound eminated from all around the room.<br>
&quot;These are the ones. Where is the vial? I need the vial..&quot;<br>
<br>
A third man stepped quitely out of the shadows. His body was wrapped tightly in leather and pads, yet two silvery daggers reflected brightly from his belt. A typical rogue, but he moved with such fluidity that he made almost no sound even as his feet sank into the grime on the floor. He held out his arm, and opened his hand, revealing a small black stone.<br>
&quot;You should need this as well, it is her soul essense.&quot; he spoke, as he handed the stone to the tall woman. &quot;And here is the vial, as promised.&quot; He removed a small vial with red liquid from a hidden compartment on his cloak, and handed it to the woman, who grabbed it greedily and removed the cork.<br>
&quot;Yes&quot;, she said as she smelled the sweet liquid, &quot;this is the right one. Do you know what this is, my dear human?&quot; she said as she looked down upon the prisoner closest to her. The woman lifted up her tired head once again to strain her vision looking at the tiny vial.<br>
&quot;No&quot; she wheezed out. Opening her mouth had cracked her dehydrated lips some, and small lines of blood began to fill the crevases.<br>
&quot;It's vampire blood. Very very rare stuff. And it's still warm. If it cools, it is useless, hence why the stuff is so expensive. Do you know what it is for?&quot; she asked haughtily.<br>
&quot;No&quot; the prisoner groaned out, as an insect broke through the skin on her leg, burrowing deeper. She could do nothing to free herself of this hell. Her arms were useless, all feeling was gone from them, and she had no more energy to squirm and let herself feel some relief from the horrid itching the hundreds of insects already inside her were causing.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you pour this into the mouth of any dead body, it will become a vampire,&quot; she spoke softly, &quot;but if there is no soul, the new vampire will be a rage driven corpse, feasting on the blood of the living and caring for absolutely nothing.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sounds like your mother to me.&quot; the prisoner said, managing a smile.<br>
&quot;Taunting will only fetch you a fate worse than what is come.&quot;<br>
<br>
A few moments went by, and as the necromancers finished thier chanting, a cold aura began to surround the skeleton as it held out it's hands. In one palm, the woman placed the soulstone, and in the other placed the vial. The soulstone burst into green light, and added to the swirling color of magic. Flesh began to form and wrap itself into tendons, muscles, organs, and eventually skin. Truly horrifying seeing an elf being created from the skeleton on up, but as soon as the half formed creature could, it clasped the vial and drank deeply from it.<br>
A loud screeching was heard as the former skeleton began to grow hair, eyes, and outer features of an elven body. In a few moments, the body of a once dead elf stood naked amongst seven others.<br>
The eyes of three prisoners widened, as the naked elf stretched her new body, feeling the power of the undead flowing through her veins, the strength of never being able to die, and the thirst for living blood. Her eyes were blue as in her former life, but behind them was the hideous glow of evil, and even standing there completely naked, she inspired fear in anyone who gazed on her. <br>
The two necromancers backed away, but the woman came face to face with the elf, smiled, and said, &quot;Welcome back, Fenye.&quot;<br>
As she grinned, a fang slipped over her lip, then ran her tongue over it, and smiled again. &quot;This is truly different... I feel like nothing can stop me. And I see you have gone through the trouble of bringing me the three who betrayed me. You truly are a greedy bitch, Nevariel.&quot;<br>
Returning the grin, Nevariel spoke, &quot;Heh, it wasn't a problem luring them here at all. They are like you told me, greedy to the core, and I simply lured them here on the promise of wealth in an unexplored dungeon. I have also brought you another gift, before we part.&quot;<br>
&quot;A bonus? I might let you have one of the prisoners as a gift on my part. What did you bring me?&quot; Fenye said with one arched eyebrow raising up inquisitively.<br>
The woman reached into a small pouch, and drew out a tiny round object, which once was removed began to grow into a breastplate, blue in tone and crackling with strong magic. &quot;It is your armor, and there is more in the bag.&quot;<br>
&quot;And my sword?&quot;<br>
&quot;It is here, too. I would suggest getting dressed before finishing the ritual. Your powers will fade soon, and you need to get your body used to the armor, well, rather get your armor used to  your body again.&quot;<br>
Fenye slipped on a few garments Nevariel gave her, and then put on the armor. It was a big smaller because her former body was a little bit shorter and not as well muscled, but the armor expanded and molded to fit her chest, arms, legs, feet and hands. <br>
Once fully dressed again, a soft bluish glow eminated from her, and a wide smile revealed both of her long fangs. Her sword however.. had changed since her death. It was no longer white and lined with runes.. There was only one rune on it now, and the blade was as black as obsidian. The single jewel on the hilt was broken, and needed a new gem to replace it.<br>
&quot;My sword is missing it's gem.&quot; Fenye said grimly, almost sneering in disgust at her servant's failure.<br>
&quot;That, my friend, I have a solution to. Your blade, once the gift of Tunare, has changed. A blade like that could not be weilded by your current nature, so I had it's pommel gem removed, and this-&quot; she displayed a white opal stone, with a fiery blue light in the center, &quot;is your new gem. Your blade now has the ability to drain the souls from the living, and let you feast on them as you please.&quot; she finished as she gave the gem to Fenye.<br>
The sword hummed as the gem was passed closer to it, and flew into the socket like an iron nail does to a magnet.<br>
<br>
Turning to the three captives, she looked over each one. &quot;Clean off thier necks. I don't want to get thier filth in my mouth. This *is* my first meal, after all.&quot; Without hesitation, the two necromancers wiped off the necks of three, slapping thier necks hard to raise the artery to the surface of the skin. After thier task was finished, they backed away and returned to the shadows whence they came from.<br>
Kneeling down on a knee, Fenye got close to the human prisoner and ran the back of her fingers across her cheek. &quot;My dear love, it's been so long since I've seen you. Oh, how I've longed to see your face again, but the only way I wish to see you now is as a corpse - just like you made me. I am whole again, and soon, you will not.&quot;<br>
Fenye tilted her head, and ran her lips softly over the skin of the human female's neck, slowly kissing her. Then, as easily as a knife cuts through air, she opened her mouth and pushed her fangs into the fleshy part of her neck, piercing through the large vein. The woman grimaced, feeling the suction as her own blood was forced out of her body. Her skin began to sink as her fluids were extracted, and soon her eyes rolled back as Fenye pulled away. &quot;I want you alive as I do the same to your friends, my love.&quot;<br>
<br>
The horrible process was done to her other friends, and when she was finished, she stood up, and unlocked the shackles around thier wrists. The bodies lay limp in the muck, and Nevariel backed out of the chamber, bowing as she said farewell.<br>
&quot;You just wait a few minutes. You'll enjoy this almost as much as I will. Witness my power.&quot; Fenye said, but her words fell on the human's near dead ears. Her head swung back and forth loosely, in a daze from the massive loss of blood. She was unsure if the human actually heard her words, but nor did she care.<br>
Then a finger twitched on the corpse closest to the human. It's head tilted upright, and planted it's hand into the muck to sit itself upright. The corpse then stood up, and began clawing away at the fleshy parts around it's eyes, tearing away anything that was it's way. Once it finished, it had two eye pits dug out, and a dim red flicker of flame burned intensely in each socket. In less than a minute, the other corpse began to stir, and soon both were standing, new additions to the undead.<br>
&quot;Say hello to your friends, they are more alive now than they ever have been.&quot; she said as she let out a snicker. &quot;Minions, let this body be your first meal after I leave this pit.&quot; She said as she turned her back on the prisoner, and headed up the stairs and out of the dungeon.<br>
<br>
The two grotesque zombies inched towards the prisoner, who awakened enough to know what was going on, and began to breathe heavily as her fate was unfolded on her.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The light of the stars set a soft glow across the grass and rocks as Fenye reached the entrance. She waited there for a few moments, taking a breath of fresh air.<br>
The screams of a dying woman being eaten alive soon echoed out of the dungeon and out into the night. Fenye smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;It really *is* good to be alive.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uselilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Board Moderator<br><font color=#A0B0E0>&lt;Violent Harvest&gt;</font></span><br>  Posts: 700<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/2/01 11:39:48 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/selilya/sel_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Betrayal is Exspensive, pt2</span><hr size=1> Splendidly woven, my dark sister... <p>Selilya Withertouch<BR>

<br>
most of my short stories are fairly &quot;evil&quot;, simply because reading about some villian is much more interesting than reading about some lawful good hero. <br>
<br>
Evil.. is good! Bad girls have more fun!<br>
<br>
But occasionally I like to write stories that deal with real emotions. I don't know if you got that from some of my stories, but alot of them relate directly to how I was feeling at the time. Sometimes I write a sad story to reflect the sadness I felt, sometimes I write a damn evil story to show I'm on some kind of power trip :P hehe<br>
<br>
I think the story called &quot;Calm Seas&quot; was my more recent story, but thank you for the compliment, Selilya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=373.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=372.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=354.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=354.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=354.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">Rants Link<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
