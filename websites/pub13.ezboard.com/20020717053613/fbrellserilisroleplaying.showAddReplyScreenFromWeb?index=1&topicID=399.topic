class=title>   Re: Into the Frozen Maw (rp)</span><hr size=1> The first wave would consists of those who had chosen to master their skills in one physical weapon or another.  These fighters would attempt to beat the Dragon down or at the very least, distract and fatigue her as the casters, such as myself slipped in and helped to finish the creature.  Nothing burned more deadly than a wizard's flame, and I had all such spells at hand.  <br>
<br>
Now the moment had come, we were prepared and the plan of attack finalized.  A shiver, more from anticipation than cold ran down my spine.  We marched with grim determination towards the great stone that blocked the Dragon's lair.  Those amongst our &quot;muscle&quot; braced themselves against it and began to push.  With a resounding crack of the ice that had frozen the rock to the floor, it began to move.  The lair now stood open, collectively we seemed to brace ourselves, should the Dragon come charging out and end our raid before it had even begun.  After waiting a few moments, which seemed like an eternity, no such doom came.  The fighters gathered themselves at the entrance.  A cry of &quot;CHARGE!&quot; rang out and they burst inward swords brandished and gleaming in the reflected light of the icy walls.  We casters stood, the sounds of battle echoed from within, waiting for the call that would bring us into action.  Time passed...too much time?  We began to wonder, mutters of doubt were passed from ear to ear.  They said, &quot;This is not good, it has been to long, the Dragon will remain undefeated,&quot; heavy with disappointment.  All such concerns were erased in a moment as the call again rang out telling us to charge.<br>
<br>
I ran through that hole in the frozen wall, my eyes darting wildly, trying to sight the Dragon and begin assisting in the attack.  I was eager, this would be the first time I would face such a creature and I knew we must succeed, for such failure could haunt one forever.  I spotted her, she was beautiful, terribly beautiful.  Lady Vox held a frightening majesty and for a moment I was mesmerized by it, until she roared.  A Dragon's roar, the sound of legend, there is nothing that walks this realm either living or dead that makes so terrifying a sound.  The wave of sound washed over me, through me, tearing at my resolve.  Fear screamed at me, &quot;RUN!&quot;, and yet I could not.  I stood there, frozen &lt;smirk&gt; until the violence of noise passed.  With significant effort I gathered my wits about me and ran at Lady Vox, to unleash my own terror.  <br>
<br>
I cast, everything I was, every fiber of my being threw itself into this effort.  Flame after flame seared her as the warriors still left standing beat her down, attacking every weak spot as it was created.  The Dragon was flailing, her breath now labored, she was defeated, she knew it, as did we.  So we continued, relentless, our victory now assured.  Lady Vox would fall, but she would not fall alone, in her remaining seconds of life, she cast one final, lethal spell and I was among those caught in it.  I felt my own life being drained out of me, I fell to the ground, a mere moment before the Dragon did as well.  I screamed my vengeance, and then I knew nothing more.<br>
<br>
Time passed, I know not how much, but I was awakened by the chanting of a cleric over my corpse.  I stood, shivering and still weak from the effects of the resurrection even as she cast her heals upon me.  I could only mumble my thanks as I stooped over my corpse and gathered my belongings.  After wrapping my robe tightly around me, I began to look around me.  There lay the Dragon.  The glory of Lady Vox was now ours.  The room at once seemed alive with victory.  Pride in our accomplishment coursed through my veins and I raised my voice in a triumphant shout.  It was immediately joined by others and in that moment there was no racial nor class distinctions, only the camaraderie that mutual victory might bring.  <br>
<br>
I chuckled to myself, glancing around the room at some of the lightcrawlers that had attended this raid.  Today, I thought, today we are equals in defeating a common foe, but tomorrow my dear moths, the old lines will still be drawn.  Even in the warm afterglow of our combined accomplishment I did not regret the ancient wars that stood throughout time and always would. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
