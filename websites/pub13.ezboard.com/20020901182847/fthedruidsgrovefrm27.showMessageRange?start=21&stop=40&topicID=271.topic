You can't protect people from their own stupidity. You know what coffee is hot. If you spill it you might burn yourself.  You mother teaches you about scalding liquids as a kid for heaven sakes.<br>
<br>
If you buy a cup of coffee and choose to drink it while driving you are taking a risk.  Not only are you taking you rmind off the road you probaby arn't focused on the coffee either. <br>
<br>
A person with even AVERAGE intelligence shouldn't need a warning label on their coffee telling them its hot and could burn them! Sheesh.  We live in a society so wrapped up in law suits and blaming other folks for our own stupidity.  Take responsibility for yourself.<br>
<br>
As for buying items online for games.  I don't know.  I think its a bit cheap. But I agree that you shouldn't have to spend HOURS camping an item to get it.  Not all of us have that sort of time.  On the other hand do  I want to go into RvR against someone who spend hundreds on just hte right equipment. I don't know.  I guess its their choice if that's how they choose to spend their money.   <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn - Warden of Connla<BR>

I've always questioned why we can't counter-sue people for clumsiness.<br>
<br>
If five thousand people walk down my sidewalk per year and one person trips, I would posit that the person who tripped by definition has a proclivity to tripping.  Why should I be held responsible for this?<br>
<br>
What happened to the concept of personal responsibility anyway?   I mean, why can't Micky Dees sue the broad who spilled the coffee for being an idiot?   There is ALWAYS assumed risk in anything that you do.  If you drive and drink coffee in the car, you assumed some risk.  You also increase your risk of getting in an accident.<br>
<br>
Suppose, instead of spilling it on herself, she dropped the coffee and it harmlessly fell on the passenger seat, yet was spilling onto the cloth.  She reaches over to pick up the cup, takes her eyes off the road, and slams her car into a bridge abutment and gets decapitated.   Who's fault is it now?   If it were caught on video tape, there'd probably be a law now that drive-thru's are illegal and some snake lawyer would be negotiating on his second yacht.<br>
<br>
I think there needs to be some legislation put into effect that essentially states. &quot;If you are NOT encapsulated in a steel capsule in a geologically stable region with food, supplies, sewage and air that will last your lifetime then you assume risk doing anything.   If you chose not to accept these risks, please enter your capsule post haste as no one is going to pay your for your own stupidity&quot;<br>

Having said that, my understanding of the evidence introduced at that trial is this:<br>
<br>
1)  McDonald's brewed their coffee about 16-20 degrees hotter than the industry standard. <br>
<br>
2)  The two reasons for doing this were: a) they thought it tasted better; and b) there were fewer refills for patrons who drank their coffee in the store (hotter coffee to longer to drink)<br>
<br>
3)  McDonalds knew that the increased temperature of the coffee was causing more serious burns on those occassions when it was spilled<br>
<br>
4)  Depspite this they decided the lower cost/inreased profit margin was good enough to continue brewing it at higher temperatures<br>
<br>
5)  Most of the verdict was based on punitive damages, which are only awardable based upon conduct which amounts to something more than simple negligence, typically willful, wanton, reckless or intentional conduct. <br>
<br>
6)  While I don't recall the original verdict, it was in the neighborhood of 2.5 million.<br>
<br>
7)  The case occurred in a jurisdiction where culpability on the plaintiff is not a complete defense.  The jury apportions negligence to each party and then the final verdict is reduced by the same percentage of negligence as was attributed to the plaintiff<br>
<br>
8)  The trial judge reduced the jury's verdict on the grounds that he found it excessive to something around $300k<br>
<br>
9)  The judge further reduced her verdict by the percentage that jury attributed to the plaintiff for that event.  <br>
<br>
The jury system will always create results that you don't agree with, but so will any other system in place.  In general I think it does a pretty good job, although I see results all the time I think are wrong.  <br>

<br>
Perhaps, but a bunch of untrained joe-blows are the <i>worst</i> people to have deciding something like punitive damages.  Punitive damages have nothing to do with deciding who's telling the truth or what really happened.  If McDonald's should be punished (and I'm not necessarily saying they should), the person deciding the punishment should be someone intimately familiar with the industry, economics, and the broader ramifications of such awards in the aggregate.  You wouldn't hire joe blow to chair the Federal Reserve Bank or to take over as CEO of a major company, and this is no different.  Also, there is no reason on earth why the plaintiff, or her attorney, should get one cent of that money.<br>

Punitive damages are considered taxable income under IRS regulations.  So to the extent the verdict provided punitives, that portion would be taxable.  Just a further FYI.  <br>

<br>
So?  The plaintiff is still getting about 33% of the it and the plaintiff's attorney is getting about 17% it.  If someone just dropped $10 million in your lap for being a total idiot, would you really start complaining that the actual award was $20 million?  I think not, you'd take the money and run, realizing you nearly stole that money as you didn't deserve it.  I don't think either the plaintiff or the attorney should get $0.01 of punitive damages.<br>
<br>
To put it differently, if it's truly "punitive", it should be a fine, and collected for the benefit of everyone.  The current system is sort of like paying your speeding ticket directly to the police officer who arrested you (for his personal use) instead of to a court.  Do you think that would be a good system? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaurincotg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saurin CoTG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#333399>(2/13/02 12:17:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Tuda I was not trying to argue the issue for or against your point, just supplying some additional information.  However, if I were to argue the point it would go something like this. . . (all in good fun and playing devil's advocate here :-))  I actually think there are some very good sound policy reasons that support your position. <br>
<br>
From a policy/PR perspective this particular case is a bad example to argue as to why the plaintiff/attorney recieve some benefit from the punitive damage award, so I am going to change it up on you for just a second and use the Ford Pinto case.  <br>
<br>
Back in the 70s the Pinto had a dangerous habit of exploding when rearended at even low and moderate speeds.  Why?  Well the design of the car had a metal rod which would puncture the gas tank with moderate body damage causing the explosion.  <br>
<br>
Now in order to prove their case, the plaintiff had to spend a substantial amount of money in costs. (court costs, expert witness fees, testing and so on) Costs in these matters are not recoverable, nor do you get to inform the jury of what they are or how much they are and if you lose or your verdict is not sufficient to cover them, you eat those costs.  In a motor vehicle product liablity claim, those costs can easily be several hundred thousand dollars.  So there can be a significant degree of risk associated with the plaintiff bringing the claim in the first place and thus the benefit accrues to the person that engaged in that risk. (so the argument goes)  <br>
<br>
Now you may not agree with it, and that is fine, many people don't.  The realities are, however, that punitive damage are rarely awarded and even more rarely upheld (there are Constitutional restraints on punitive awards), but when they happen they tend to get a lot of press.  <br>

You do not own anything when you play MMOG's, it is clearly stated as such in the end users liscence agreement for mmog's. Since what is on your char, and even your char, are all intellectual property of the developer. As such, this reasoning about how one charges for ones time is moot. Your time might equal $$$ for you but you are still selling of a companies intellectual property to someone else, be they a player of that game or not.<br>
<br>
VI had a little problem trying to clue in EBay, until they realised this corporation has a fairly substantial legal team backing them and I doubt the same could be said of EBay or their legal team realised they were &quot;screwed&quot;. The outcome will be no different than the VI/EBay. These &quot;salespeople&quot; agree to the same terms we all agree to and are bound by it. Some lawyer realised he'd make a nice chunk of change even if it was only his fees on a loss. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=griifrine>Griifrine</A> at: 2/13/02 7:34:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalbor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malbor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid in Absentia<br>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 607<br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 10:07:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/malbor/malbor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> <br>

Not True.  I'm not selling the little data bits off of Mythic's computers.  I'm selling my access rights to those bits.   The rights to those bits are awarded to me via access fees.  <br>
<br>
I really don't see what the big deal is.  I don't buy or sell anything on Ebay, but frankly, who gives a rats ass anyway.   If I had never once heard of Ebay and unless someone told me, I could spend 10 years in DAoC, EQ, AC, etc and still not be able to objectively quantify how exactly it is that Ebay affects my character.   No one can, they conjecture, theorize and claim it's bad, it causes camping, it does this it does that.  They can't prove it causes anything, no one can. I think Ebay is just a nice friendly scapegoat to lump all the ills of the world upon.<br>
<br>
What some people fail to realize is that demand will always exceed supply.   When supply exceeds demand, demand disappears.  This means that coveted items will ALWAYS be camped if they are campable.  ALWAYS.   Ending Ebay won't end trading of items or characters, there will always be a medium of exchange.<br>
<br>
The argument 'well, they don't deserve it, I did it legitimately and camped  the frenzied for 36 hours straight myself' doesn't hold much water either.   It comes down to people comparing themselves to others constantly.  I can't stand in town in AC for more than 5 minutes without at least one person examining me.    People seem to want to &quot;be better than the other guy&quot;.   Frankly though, someone else having the ultimate sword of whoop-ass doesn't detract from my accomplishment of beating Bael Zha'ron naked in the slightest.   The moment I'm more concerned about what someone else has or  how they got it, is the moment I've given over my locus of control to others, why on Earth/Norrath/Dereth/Etc would anyone do that?   *shakes head*<br>
<br>
I've never figured out why people care.   Try this experiment.  Make a character in whatever game, talk to the fewest people possible and level them from 1 to 50/60/126 and make no mention of Ebay or trading or whatever.  When done come back here and quantitatively state how it was that Ebay affected your game?   Bet you won't be able to state one example of where it affected you.  Oh and anecdotal 'We went to the hand and it was camped, so it must be Ebay' doesn't work.<br>
<br>
I'm waiting...<br>

<br>
It's still remarkably assinine to purchase DAoC items due to decay. What is the point? As for selling accounts, they take the same stance that VI/SoE do, it's not allowed and accounts have allready been banned due to attempted sales. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalbor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malbor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid in Absentia<br>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 608<br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 3:36:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/malbor/malbor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> <br>

I never said they were stored clientside.<br>

The following statement is in direct contridiction to the one below.<br>
&gt;&gt;And as stated above, you have no rights to those &quot;bits&quot;, since those bits are mythic's intellectual property.<br>
<br>
Ok, no rights to them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; All your fees allocate to you is the ability to store your &quot;data&quot; in their database,&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Now we have rights to them.  You and YOUR indicate ownership of a right.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and again that data does not belong to you since mythic is in charge of that database not the player.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
And again, I don't claim ownership to the data.  I claim ownership to the right to access that data.  That right is what is in contention here.<br>
<br>
Here's a metaphor.   I buy a ticket to a baseball game.  I now have a right to access that football game.  I am allowed to sell that right to another person as long as I don't exceed the face value of the ticket.   I don't own the players, I don't own the stadium, but I do own the right to be there and the right to consume what's there(i.e. game)<br>

&quot;I'm not selling the little data bits off of Mythic's computers.&quot; <br>
<br>
Which you are if you sell items from your account or your account. Where else do you think it's stored other than their databases?<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we have rights to them. You and YOUR indicate ownership of a right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Language that I use does not indicate a right nor ownership. You pay for &quot;storage&quot; you don't pay for anything else. YOU can access that data to your hearts content, not anyone else...you.<br>
<br>
And metaphors like the one you used are never a great way to try to get a point accross because it's all apples and oranges. You don't, in essence, digitally sign your rights away on certain aspects of the game when you enter the park or buy a ticket, or at least I have never had to sign a waiver to get into a ballgame. EULA is an agreement, that states in pretty clear legal terms what you can and can't do with any mmog. In EQ you agree to it every time you login. Although I play on Pendragon, so I don't see the EULA popups as much as when I login to a production server, but you also have to agree with this at least once in DAoC to even gain access to login. But by even installing the software (client) you agree to the TOS and EULA, that my friend is legally binding. And again is why I don't understand how other than some greedy assed lawyer needing to make some quick cash, this case even made it this far. It's a waste of court time and it's a waste of the peoples tax money that pay for the legal system to operate so imbeciles can sue each other over the most mundane and assinine reasons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=griifrine>Griifrine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 7:38:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> I'll just post the portions of the EULA that cover whet we're talking about. You all decide what is legal and what is not from the terminology.<br>
<br>
2. Other Rights and Limitations <br>
<br>
* This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with any trademarks or service marks of Mythic.  <br>
We may amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion. Amendments shall be communicated to you either a) at the time you log into your Account; b) through a conspicuous post on our website. Such amendments shall be effective  upon entering or re-entering the Game.  If any such revision of this Agreement is unacceptable to you, you my terminate your membership as per Section 13.<br>
* We and our suppliers shall retain ownership of all intellectual property rights relating to or residing in the CD-ROM, the Software and the Game. The Software is a commercial item.<br>
* You acknowledge and agree that all characters created, and items acquired and developed as a result of game play are part of the Software and Game and are the sole property of Mythic. You acknowledge that: (i) the Software and the Service permit access to Content that is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights owned by Mythic as covered in Section 3 below.  <br>
<br>
3. Copyright<br>
This Game is owned by Mythic Entertainment and is protected by the United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Mythic retains all rights not expressly granted.  Therefore, you must treat the Game like any other copyrighted material (for example, a movie or book) except that you may make either (a) make one copy of the Game solely for backup or archival purposes, or (b) transfer the Game to a single hard disk provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.  You may not copy the written materials accompanying the Game in whole or in part without the express written permission of Mythic.<br>
<br>
* BY CLICKING THE &quot;I ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON AND PROVIDIN US WITH A CREDIT CARD NUMBER, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AN ADULT AND ARE EITHER ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR YOUR CHILD. You may not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account). You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account, and parents or guardians are liable for the activities of their child. Corporations and other entities are not eligible to procure Accounts.<br>
* Upon registration, you must select a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and are responsible for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc. resulting from your disclosure or allowing the disclosure of any password or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your Account.<br>
* You may not disclose your password to any third party. We never ask you for your password by telephone or email, and you should not disclose it this way if someone asks you to do so. There may be an additional charge to reissue lost passwords. Although we may offer a feature that allows you to &quot;save&quot; or &quot;remember&quot; your password on your hard drive, please note that third parties may be able to access your computer and thus your Account.<br>
* To obtain an Account, you will be required to choose both a login name and a player name. While you are encouraged to use a pseudonym, especially if you are a minor, you may not pick a name that violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary rights.  Acceptance of a pseudonym by the gaming system does not constitute a finding by Mythic that your chosen pseudonym does not violate any third party's trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary rights, and you as the user are responsible for any liability in the choosing of a pseudonym.  Mythic retains the right to reject any pseudonym it concludes, in its sole discretion, is indecent, obscene, or otherwise violates standards of good taste.<br>
* As part of your Account, you can upload content to our servers in various forms, such as in the selections you make for the Game and in chat rooms and similar user-to-user areas (collectively, your &quot;Content&quot;). Your Content shall not: (a) infringe any third party intellectual property, other proprietary or publicity/privacy rights; (b) violate any law or regulation; (c) be defamatory, obscene, child pornographic or harmful to minors; or (d) contain any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. We may take any action with respect to your Content if we believe it may create liability for us or may cause us to lose (in whole or in part) the services of our ISPs or other suppliers. You hereby grant to us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise all intellectual property rights, in any media now known or not currently known, associated with your Content.<br>
<br>
9. Selling of Items<br>
You may not sell or auction any Game characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.<br>
The selling of items, coins or any copyrighted part of the Game's player character whether through online auctions (for example Ebay), newsgroup or postings on message board is in violation of this EULA as well as Mythic's Player Code of Conduct. In addition to violating our agreement, selling items and/or coin violates our legal rights and may constitute misappropriation, and/or tortuous interference with our business and tarnishes the goodwill in the Dark Age of Camelot(tm) name.<br>
<br>
13. Termination<br>
* Either you or Mythic may terminate your Account, for any reason, without further obligation to the other.  Further, Mythic reserves the right to terminate the Game at any time without further obligation to you.<br>
* As way of example, Mythic may terminate this Agreement (including your Software license and your Account) immediately and/or terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Game, without notice if Mythic believes, in its sole discretion, that your conduct (including but not limited to gameplay, chat or any other player activity) is unacceptable and/or inappropriate or for conduct which Mythic believes (a) breaches the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) repeatedly infringes any third party intellectual property rights; (c)  in violation of the spirit of the Game; (d)  is harmful to Mythic or other users of the Game (e) lying, misleading or otherwise providing false information to Mythic personnel; (f) is violation of any of the policies/guidelines as set forth in the player rules of conduct, which are posted at www.mythicentertainment.com/rulesofconduct.  Mythic may also terminate your account if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us, Mythic reserves the right to deny access to any individual as a player of the Game. or if we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us, A copy of these rules, as they existed at the time this CD-ROM was published is contained on this disk in a document entitled &quot;rulesofconduct.txt&quot;.  All of the Sections of this Agreement survive termination of this Agreement.<br>
* Members whose Accounts have been terminated by Mythic may not access the Game in any manner or any reason, including through any other Account, without the express written permission of Mythic.  Active Members may not knowingly allow former Members whose Accounts have been terminated to use the active Member's Accounts.<br>
* Your only right and remedy with respect to any dissatisfaction with the Game is to terminate this Agreement, including, without limitation, any dissatisfaction with (i) any terms and conditions of this Agreement, or any policy or practice of Mythic in operating the Game, (ii) content available in the Game, or any change therein, or (iii) the amount or type of fees or billing methods, or any change thereof.<br>
* IF EITHER PARTY TERMINATES THIS AGREEMENT, THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CLOSED AND MYTHIC WILL NOT REFUND THE BALANCE OF ANY PREPAID PERIOD.  WE MAY ALSO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT IF WE DECIDE, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, TO DISCONTINUE OFFERING THE GAME, IN WHICH CASE WE MAY PROVIDE YOU, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO DO SO, WITH A PRORATED REFUND OF ANY PREPAID AMOUNTS.  ANY PART OF THE ACCOUNT, CHARACTERS OR DATA STORED THEREON WILL BE LOST AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TRANSFER OR ASSIGN THEM TO ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS.  IN THE EVENT THAT THE ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED, MYTHIC RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE ANY AND ALL OTHER ACCOUNTS THAT SHARE THE MEMBER NAME, PHONE NUMBER, EMAIL ADDRESS, INTERNET PROTOCOL ADDRESS OR CREDIT CARD NUMBER WITH THE TERMINATED ACCOUNT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 4529<br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 10:26:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> I'm a litigator.  I do copyright and trademark litigation as well as plain old commercial litigation.  I'm also a licensed patent attorney (you have to pass a federal bar exam to be a patent attorney).  So I will accept your invitation to look at the language of the EULA and see where it applies to this case.  I will accept the advice of my insurer below and further state that this is not a legal opinion and is not meant to be the provision of legal advice, it is for entertainment purposes only... :)<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>* This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with any trademarks or service marks of Mythic. </i><br>
<br>
Doesn't apply.  No one is claiming any rights to Mythic's trademarks or service marks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>We may amend this Agreement at any time in our sole discretion. Amendments shall be communicated to you either a) at the time you log into your Account; b) through a conspicuous post on our website. Such amendments shall be effective upon entering or re-entering the Game. If any such revision of this Agreement is unacceptable to you, you my terminate your membership as per Section 13.</i><br>
<br>
Not relevant to the issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i> We and our suppliers shall retain ownership of all intellectual property rights relating to or residing in the CD-ROM, the Software and the Game. The Software is a commercial item.</I><br>
<br>
Just restates the obvious.  Still doesn't apply to the case at hand, because no intellectual property rights are being infringed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I> You acknowledge and agree that all characters created, and items acquired and developed as a result of game play are part of the Software and Game and are the sole property of Mythic.</I><br>
<br>
Not impacted.  When you sell something on ebay, such as access to a character or item, where is the character or item before the transaction?  On Mythic's servers.  Where are they afterwards? On Mythic's servers.  The character or item itself (more properly, the data comprising that character or item) is still the sole property of Mythic before and after the sale of the asset rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<I> You acknowledge that: (i) the Software and the Service permit access to Content that is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights owned by Mythic as covered in Section 3 below. </I><br>
<br>
This supports my interpretation.  What we as players get is "access to Content."   That Content may be protected by various laws, but since the Content isn't being sold, there is no violation of those laws.  We have the right of access (that's what we're paying for), and the right of access is what is being sold on ebay (or elsewhere).<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>3. Copyright<br>
This Game is owned by Mythic Entertainment and is protected by the United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Mythic retains all rights not expressly granted. </i><br>
<br>
Nothing surprising here.  There's no infringement of any copyrights in the Game, so there's no impact.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Therefore, you must treat the Game like any other copyrighted material (for example, a movie or book) except that you may make either (a) make one copy of the Game solely for backup or archival purposes, or (b) transfer the Game to a single hard disk provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes. </I><br>
<br>
No impact again.  No one is making a copy of the Game or transferring the Game or selling the Game.  Just access rights to data within the Game.<br>
<br>
In fact, this statement supports my earlier argument, which used the book and movie analogy.  We don't have the right to make and sell copies, but we do have the right to sell our copy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>You may not copy the written materials accompanying the Game in whole or in part without the express written permission of Mythic.</I><br>
<br>
Not relevant, as no written materials are being copied.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>* BY CLICKING THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON AND PROVIDIN US WITH A CREDIT CARD NUMBER, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AN ADULT AND ARE EITHER ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR YOUR CHILD.</i><br>
<br>
Not relevant, although Mythic is skating on thin ice.  What they are trying to avoid are the problems of contracting with minors.  If push came to shove, Mythic would lose any case involving this issue.<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>You may not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account). </I><br>
<br>
The only contractual provision of direct relevance so far.  Selling an account would be transferring an account, and thus would be a breach of this contractual provision.  That doesn't have anything to do with copyright law.  Nor does this provision prohibit the selling of items.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<I>You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account, and parents or guardians are liable for the activities of their child. Corporations and other entities are not eligible to procure Accounts.</I><br>
<br>
Not relevant to this issue.<br>
<br>
<I>* Upon registration, you must select a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and are responsible for any damage, harm, lost or deleted characters, etc. resulting from your disclosure or allowing the disclosure of any password or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your Account.</I><br>
<br>
Not relevant to this issue.<br>
<br>
<I>* You may not disclose your password to any third party. We never ask you for your password by telephone or email, and you should not disclose it this way if someone asks you to do so. There may be an additional charge to reissue lost passwords. Although we may offer a feature that allows you to "save" or "remember" your password on your hard drive, please note that third parties may be able to access your computer and thus your Account.</I><br>
<br>
I'll presume that selling an account would involve the disclosure of a password.  Same result as above, though: just a breach of contract, not a violation of copyright law.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>* To obtain an Account, you will be required to choose both a login name and a player name. While you are encouraged to use a pseudonym, especially if you are a minor, you may not pick a name that violates anyone's trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary rights. Acceptance of a pseudonym by the gaming system does not constitute a finding by Mythic that your chosen pseudonym does not violate any third party's trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary rights, and you as the user are responsible for any liability in the choosing of a pseudonym.

Your Content shall not: (a) infringe any third party intellectual property, other proprietary or publicity/privacy rights; (b) violate any law or regulation; (c) be defamatory, obscene, child pornographic or harmful to minors; or (d) contain any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information.

<br>
Not relevant.<br>
<br>
<i>9. Selling of Items<br>
You may not sell or auction any Game characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.<br>
The selling of items, coins or any copyrighted part of the Game's player character whether through online auctions (for example Ebay), newsgroup or postings on message board is in violation of this EULA as well as Mythic's Player Code of Conduct. </I><br>
<br>
This is the same as the prohibition on transferring characters.  Breach of contract issue, not a copyright issue.  Interestingly, this provision means that NO ONE can sell or auction any items inside the Game at all, even for gold.  Selling and auctioning is the same in game terms regardless of how arranged: inside the game, outside the game, on ebay, on a b-board, etc.  Mythic just prohibited any in-game trading.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>In addition to violating our agreement, selling items and/or coin violates our legal rights and may constitute misappropriation, and/or tortuous interference with our business and tarnishes the goodwill in the Dark Age of Camelot(tm) name.</I><br>
<br>
This is what the lawsuit is about.  The reference to misappropriation is laughable, in my opinion, as that requires something to be taken.  If it is misappropriation for me to sell item X for dollars, it is equally misappropriation for me to sell item X for gold.  What happens to Item X in both cases is identical.<br>
<br>
If anything, Mythic is being legally frivolous here.  It almost makes me want to sue them for trying to enforce this frivolous language.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, for the first 2 or 3 months of release, there was no EULA pop-up or "click wrap" agreement.  Makes me wonder if adding this EULA pop-up at this late date has any legal effect at all.<br>

Oh well . . . back to your regularly scheduled EULA debate. :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=griifrine>Griifrine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333399>(2/15/02 12:10:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Oh well, all moot now. I found out 1st hand last night how broad the terminology of the EULA is. This is my tale of woe.<br>
<br>
I play on test, and am in the largest guild there in Hib. I missed the &quot;train&quot; out to some RVR and have never done any RVR at my paltry level 25 with my druid. So I start talking about how I wish I had a second comp next to mine with linux on it so I could use the mapping features of Odin's Eye (ShowEQ for DAoC) or hoped that Ben from Xylobot would add DAoC support so I would at least have an overlay map. Well one of the folks from my guild states that I should mind what I say when he's on concerning these issues. So I querry one of the folks I regularely group with and find out he's either a dev or a mythic employee. I announce my faux pas to guild chan and then start getting tells from folks wondering WTH is this OE and xylobot and how they work. One asked me if either could be &quot;scanned&quot; for while your playing. This is where my typical stupidity drops in. I mistell the reply to guild rather than reply! Less than a min later I'm staring at the desktop and can no longer access my account. All this over just TALKING about thinking about using a 3rd party app.<br>
<br>
Oh well, back to EQ for me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=griifrine>Griifrine</A> at: 2/15/02 9:12:18 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=271.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=271.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=271.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=271.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=40><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.threadControl?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm31">Interface Design</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27>General - DAOC</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
