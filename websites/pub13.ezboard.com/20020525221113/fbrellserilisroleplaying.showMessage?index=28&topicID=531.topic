Above her, the roof if tiled with leafs of crystal. The receding daylight refracts into myriads of colors through the clear ceiling and is reflected on the walls that are made of mirrors of pounded and polished mithral. She steps off the staircase and completely enters the room with Wardrym behind her. The door they entered in closes to complete the circle of mirrors that make the walls of the round room. They can hear the mechanism that is retracting the staircase below back into it's resting place.<br>
<br>
Upon the floor she finds no dust but a pristine floor of ivy-green marble, tiled with a huge pearly star of abalone. In the center of this star sits a pedestal made of an ancient full-size trunk from a ancient gnarled tree. Upon it's base on a mithral stand lies a large book covered in gold under a crystal dome.<br>
<br>
Saffryn looks to Wardrym for reassurance, and he nods her ahead with, &quot;only you can approach the book, I must stay on the green marble. I cannot step upon the star.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding her understanding she slowly approaches the domed book. As her breath touches the crystal, it rises on it's own. Saffryn's eyes widen, then narrow as she opens her palms in the open space between the dome and the book to sense for traps. She knows she has not the skills of a rogue, but her ranger skills are sharp and she feels no apprehension. <br>
<br>
She places her right hand upon the golden cover with a look of awe, noting the star engraved upon it, a Willow tree within the star. The surprise of that makes her voice catch in the start of a giggle and wonders if she is getting too nervous. &quot;Look, Ward, a willow tree on the cover of it, of all things. It looks like that ancient tree at the creek on your estate!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ward smiles sideways as he edges as close as he dare and still remain on the green parts of the floor, &quot;Coincidence, I'd guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns the cover to the first page and sighs with disappointment, &quot;It's in ancient elvish, I cannot read it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can, you step to the side and turn the pages. The writing is large enough, I should be able to make it out from here.&quot; He says as she steps to the lower left leg of the star while he remains on the point of the green between the star's legs. &quot;'The Lawful Book of Tunare', is what the large words say. The smaller words say 'A Gift of Wisdom to Her People'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The paper is like a parchement I've never felt before. I can't believe I'm touching this book with my bare hands,&quot; says Saffryn as she turns the page.<br>
<br>
&quot;A drought has come upon Tunaria&quot;, Ward begins, &quot;at the hands of Solusek Ro just as a drought from Hope and all that is Good assails all the races upon this land. As the trees die of our mighty forest, so do My people's hearts wither and dry like empty husks. My Eldritch are a Good and Noble race, and must be preserverd. I shall take them out of Takish Hur unto a New World across the Ocean of Tears.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My people shall leave behind their ties and and politics and divide themselves into but two Houses, Feir'Dal and Koada'Dal, meaning Forest Dwell and Stone Dwell. Those with the skills of the woodsmen, the hunters, the magic of nature, shall gather together into the Family of Feir'Dal. Those who excel in enchantments and wizardries will aid the Feir'Dal with magical fortifications while they protect themselves in the New World with fortifications of stone. Within their walls, they shall also protect those with Holy visions, the clerics and my Holy Warriors, the Paladins. Together, these two Houses shall have warriors to encircle and protect the families as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So that no House shall have unfair power over the other, A Star Council shall be formed as a parliament to their King or Queen. This Council shall have Five Arms, no arm having more power than another. The person representing each Arm shall have the title of Duke or Duchess. These five arms shall be comprised of the following.<br>
1. The High-Tower: This seat shall represent the interests of the Enchanters, Mages, and Wizards. Within that conclave, they may divide themselves into Marquis and Marquises, one for each discipline of magic, all answering to the Duke or Duchess of the Tower of Magic. Of the Elements, they shall represent Air, intelligence, and the Mind of Tunare.<br>
2. The Papacy. This seat shall represent the interests of the Holy, the Clerics, my Paladins, and the Druids. Each of them may also have a Marquie or Marquissa. Of the Elements, they shall represent water, wisdom, and the Heart of Tunare.<br>
3. The Mithrals. This seat shall represent the Merchant Barons, the Elements of Earth and the Prosperity of Tunare. They may have as many or as few Marquis and Marquesses as they wish to stir up their pots, but the economy of the people shall have but one Duke or Duchess and therefore only one Mithral Vote to stay the inclination of Greed.<br>
<br>
4. The Guardians: This seat shall represent the interests of those who physically protect the Eldritch. They are the Warriors, Scouts, and Rangers and each may be represented by a Marquie or Marquiessa. This seat represents the Elements of Fire, War, The Protection of Tunare.<br>
<br>
<br>
These Four Arms shall make up the Parliament of Tunare, to aid the King or Queen in the spiritual, emotional, physical, and economic health of My People. If and when a time comes that they, My Parliament shall find a matter in which they deadlock in opinion and vote, they shall call upon the Fifth and Final Arm of the Star Council. The Peacekeeper, or Lodan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of all the Trees of My Forest, it is the Willow that bends the farthest and does not break. The greatest quakes may shake it. The strongest winds may blow. The Willow ever bends with the times and remains firm in Her Soil and Strong in Her Heart. So shall be the Arm of the Lodan, the Peacekeeper. It will be their vote that decides a deadlock.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saffryn turns the final page to find the back cover of the book. &quot;That's it? What about the Princes and the Barons, who decides who gives what to who and all that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym swallows with a dry mouth from all that reading and rubs his eyes, stepping farther back into the green area of the floor to ensure his safety. &quot;It's as I thought. The book has been added too and manipulated to read as the Koada'Dal dared while the Fier'Dal were busy protecting everyone's butts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder where the Bards fit it,&quot; wonders Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, Bards. Musicians that sing, heal, fight in battles, they do a little bit of everything. Tunare said nothing about where they fit in.&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess then the Bards have the freedom to decided for themselves. You sure have a knack for thinking of the strangest things at the darndest times.&quot; Says Wardrym<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks to me like the Koada'Dal decided a lot for themselves and everyone else,&quot; she says, side-stepping Ward's verbal poke. &quot;What are we going to do about it?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
<br>
