This makes sense, just like in real life not everybody can have the best.  Sure I'd love to have a phat bank account, expensive house and a nice car but that life isn't for everybody.  In reality it takes patience, determination and alot of personal effort to achieve that status.<br>
<br>
Personally I think Verant screwed up this whole epic implementation. For any class there shouldn't be more than a handfull of epics per server.  I have completed 3 epics so far and have a druid epic, monk epic and cleric epic. There is NO way I should have been able to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
Pre patch the Mage, Necro, Wizard, Warrior and Druid epics were the only ones I felt rare enough to be called &quot;epic.&quot;  When you saw somebody with one of these, you knew you were looking at one of the few on the server. That person had the conections, resources, patience and determination to get it accomplished. And yes there is an element of luck or being in the right place at the right time that plays a factor.<br>
<br>
Yes you pay the same 10 bucks everybody else does. Yes you have every right to start the quest if you choose. But if some of the components take too much time, or you have too many real life commitments to devote to the game, then perhaps this particular item isn't for you.  There are plenty of items that I would like to get but I probably never will.  These items are not for me. Why does everybody have this sense of entitlement to the epics? Just because you can start a quest entitles you to finish it? How many people started the Tunarean Court Membership quest only to get stuck because they cannot get to PoM?  Until you have the resources to get there and kill Lith, this item is not for you.<br>
<br>
When I saw the descriptions of the epic quests before they went live, I didn't expect to get one myself. I figured they would be like GM quests where the reward would be so rare that only a few would have one on each server.  With the stats on these epics I highly doubt there will ever be a better item to replace this slot.  This entire quest can now be done front to back with 1-2 people and a couple fights taking 1-2 groups.  Epic quests in general have become the biggest example of imbalanced risk vs. reward since I looted a Dragon Spine Staff off of Silverwing.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that any changes to the epics should have made them as rare as the Mage/Necro epics, not this free-for-all that we have now.<br>

The fault lies with Verant for the huge disparity in the difficulty of these quests.  Rogue/Shaman/Cleric/Monk/Ranger epics are practically standard equipment now, and to me that is just ridiculous. There should have been much more consultation between the different quest designers to get some kind of consistency.  <br>
<br>
We all know that not everyone should get an epic.  However, I also feel that everyone should have the same chance at an epic and the two are not mutually exclusive.  Regarding something like this, it's ludicrous to reward people for making arbitrary decisions (i.e. which class you picked to level).  When you see someone else getting something better than what you have and having a much much easier time of it because of that arbitrary decision there is bound to be jealousy.  And given the nature of the way the internet and EQ works that jealousy turns into whining and flames on message boards.  It's really a no-win situation.  They couldn't make the easy quests hard, and they couldn't make the hard quests too much easier.  <br>
<br>
The only thing that's really changed is Faydedar.  It still looks like only 2 VS stones a week so I would hardly say there will be an explosion in new druid epics.  I think they should have made him much harder though, like a Trakanon-level encounter since he is triggered now.  But either way, putting a quest piece on something like the old Faydedar or Quillmane is just poorly thought out.  <br>
<br>
The bottom line is that for better or worse these changes were made.  The new quests don't directly affect those who are already finished.  The stats are the same and you are the ones who chose to sit out in TD for hours on end.  It's just too bad the vocal minority of those people who did the old quest happen to be jackasses flaming others for having an easier quest.  Be proud of your accomplishment, don't use it to belittle others.  If you have a problem, deal with it and move on ... just play the game. <p>~Tunare's Enforcer~<br>

I also have no problem with VS being a one week spawn.  The problem i have with VS is the uber guilds that camp him.  I have the time and actually have the people to take VS down, the problem lies with the time that VS spawns and how fast he goes down.  75% of the group of people that I have access to for this raid live in the US.  They are also adults that have jobs.  By the time I get the people on-line and to a place to take VS down he is long dead.<br>
But this is not the biggest problem.  The biggest problem is the Uber guild selling or destroying the stones.  This is the problem I have with the epic.   <p>SUNNDEW FROSTCLAW(CLAW)<BR>

<br>
Fay really does need to be a bit tougher. Just up his level to 60. Make it more of a challange. That or have him spawn with two midget 53+ un-mezable baby dragons.<br>
<br>

I personally never understood why there are so big differences on difficulty between all the FA. Anyway, now it is too late to make them all harder, i dont think it would be something fair to do. The only solution for them is to make them all easy... =/<br>
<br>
But, in another hand Mokuzai, u have also to admit that there was definately a problem with Faydedar. Did verant made the good choice by making him a triggered spawn ? Honnestly, i dont know, i wont complain since that allowed me to finish my fa (yes, i decided to stop doing my druid quest after camping fay and kitting it for a friend once and seeing it depop in front of me..),  maybe they could have done it a bit differently. <br>
<br>
I also think that all those people who cant stay 24 hours straight in front of their pc, should have a chance of completing their epic. And, the way how fay was before didnt really allow it. Everyone here knows that if anyone wanted to have a real chance of killing fay, he had to own 2 computers and a permanent connexion, and make a bait.. Thats the thing i really disliked on how the epic was, it sounded too stupid for me =/<br>
<br>
In another side, if i look at the rogue, cleric or shaman epic, i dont think the druid one is much easier. <br>
<br>
I wonder what the word &quot;epic&quot; could mean for verant. <br>
<br>
Is an &quot;epic&quot; weapon something very very rare, close to an artifact ? Or, just a powerfull weapon kinda easy obtainable ? <br>
<br>
And, it is also hard to define what a easy quest is. Killing fay might be easy for you and your friends, but maybe there are people who will have a ton of difficulty to do it. <br>
<br>
I am not sure to have a real opinion on this. <br>
<br>
I just disagree with you about the fact that any changes should have made it as rare as nec/sk fa, it is really too late now imo to do this, too many people (cler, rogue, sham..) got their epic. It wouldnt be fair for all the others..<br>
<br>
You made a reference to the dragon spine staff, i totally agree with you, it is kinda weird to see a such weapon there, when i think at all the time it took to all of my guild to get rdy for vp. Well, there is definately a problem in this case about the risk/reward..<br>

<br>
Talk thread: one of the biggest complaints was the epic - Namely Faydedar.  <br>
<br>
All the people complaining already have their epics or have easy access to them (knowing they soon will achieve their goal).  The Little guys *Like me* never had a chance at it... nor do we really now but the chance has been increased a bit.<br>
<br>
It's just like life.  The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  When a spawn in Perma-camped by two guilds on a server REFUSING to allow the other, smaller guild a shot (or charging 50k for looting rights) at that boss mob, something needs to be done.  So Verant has tried (not wonderfully successful but better) to even out the balance of these encounters.  <br>
<br>
It is amusing to see the whine coming from the flip side of the coin for a change. /chuckle  <br>
<br>
Anyway... if you have your epic Good for You!!! You should be happy if someone in the non-uber guild has theirs because more than likely they spent twice the time trying to get it than you and had to pay out the arse for items they couldn't readily obtain.  <br>

You made the leap of faith several times trying to hand in things noone else di before beack in the beginning of the epic quest. You were teh first one with an elaborate scimitar (the NO RENT bugged version). And once they fixed teh quest you have been the first one with the Druid epic on all servers ...<br>
<br>
You also been lucky enough to kill Faydedar during the Hallowen event in LoIO ... just after the patch made teh pod of water DRU only ... and got your epic afte  a petition cus the last step was bugged ..<br>
<br>
I do remember you since then and between all you surely need to be thank and respect for all you did to discover this quest ...<br>
<br>
but ... you never camped Fay right ?<br>
Thought so ... I did for 15days played time (well leaving PC up day and night and wok hours, not sitting staring at the screen) he despawned on me once druing pullin and my guild was all ready at chessboard island, another time he s been killed by the Iksar Master ... <br>
That needed fix ... but i can understand how someone that never camped him do not realize the frustration behind all that farce.<br>
<br>
Nothing is epic in the current epic weapons .. <br>
<br>
how to implement a real "epic" quest ?<br>
The quest should have required multiple ultra-rare drops off multiples high lvl encounter like Phara Dar, Hoskar, Trakanon, etc ..<br>
So rare that wouldn't drop more than once every 20 kills ... <br>
This way only you would have no more than an handful of epic weapon per server and also would require long long time to complete the epic (RL year maybe) ...<br>

The put something in the game to give us, the not quite uber, something to play for. Honestly, if they put my quest in VP like you are suggesting, I would quit the game. My only motivation at this point, after 2 years of playing, is to get my epic. I think all epics should be right around the level of the druid epic in difficulty. I think upping Faydedar a bit in level would be appropriate (maybe 57-58), and having the remains spawn randomly over a certain time period would also save a lot of heartache. Other then that, it's perfect how it is and gives us all something to work towards. Something that seems nearly impossible for many of us, but just barely in reach if we try hard enough. Now if you are in an Uber guild, its a different story all together, but honestly I am sick of hearing the uber guilded bitching, you have it easy.<br>

<br>
I don't remember what level I was when the epic quests were rolled out. I do, however, remember looking at the quest spoilers and thinking, &quot;Looks long, boring, and very uber.&quot; Reading the posts here about the problems with Fay left me totally uninterested in the quest. Because it was too hard? No, because the implementation was obviously screwed up. I'm more interested now. =)<br>
<br>
As for who should have an epic weapon, what does &quot;epic&quot; mean? Difficult? Maybe. But when I think of &quot;epic&quot; I think of a long journey. That's what the epic weapon quests are.<br>
<br>
And what about the GM weapons given away at the Fan Fares? Those are certainly one in a million weapons for a ridiculously small amount of effort. Does that bother me? Nope. Why should it? It's a game.<br>

I wasn't the first actually, Sobe was. I was either the 2nd or damn close.  And no I never had to camp Faydedar.  Although I agree that the Faydedar spawn was bugged, it kept the rarity in check.  You camped Fay for 15 days. Obviously completing the epic was worth that time for you or you never would have done it. Before the epic was implemented, I have seen Fay up at least 3 times just passing through the zone or hunting raptors for exp. You don't need to camp him particularily, just need to be in the right place at the right time.  But if you want to ensure your spawn, then it's up to you if you want to invest the time it takes to be there when it spawns.<br>
<br>
Lanimret -- Thats not out of scope of what verant would do. How long has the original FA way back when been in the game before they finally had to change the quest because nobody could find it?  Also there is an entire zone that has gone to waste to most of the player base.  PoM is a very interesting zone and many things to discover but as it stands 98% of the player base will never see the zone.<br>
<br>
Not that any of this matters. You must understand that i'm not advocating that they change it to be more rare. I'm just stating that i'm disappointed in how it was changed.<br>

<br>
What about the people like myself that had the resources to complete the quest yet had to deal with depops, ks'ing, ninja'ing, etc.  I needed fay and only Fay for two months.  Are you saying I'm any less deserving of my epic than you are?<br>
<br>
The real problem is how easy Verant made some of the quests.  Everyone saw Ragebringer #167869876 and said, 'Hey!  I deserve my epic too!!!!'.  And in a way they were right.  Each epic weapon should have been equally difficult and this wouldn't have been a problem.  The way Verant implemented them opened the door to epics being available to everyone. <p>Jaeden Grae<br>

I think the Driid Epic is just fine the way it is now (and yes, I DO have my epic). Even with the changes. Fay was way too rare to be in an epic quest. The way the quest stands now, you still have to kill off several mobs that are difficult. Fay is still no walk in the park. It takes alot of preperation to kill him still. VS is still a one week spawn and the remains look as if they are as well. There still won't be a flood of these things on the servers, as it's still a long and fairly difficult in spots quest to complete. As for the other epics? I could care less. I don't play that class and I don't care if there are a million ragebringers in the game, I'll never own (or even want) one. Just my 2 coppers. <p>Aluien Shadowstorm<BR>

Freedom is something you assume. Then you wait for someone to try to take it away from you. The degree to which you resist is the degree to which you are free.

The took one of the harder epics and made it by far the easiest one out there now. You know for sure now that people are going to be playing druids(as if we didn't have enough) just because there epic is a piece of cake to get. I know people who have made monks and rogues because of that very reason. <p><HTML>
