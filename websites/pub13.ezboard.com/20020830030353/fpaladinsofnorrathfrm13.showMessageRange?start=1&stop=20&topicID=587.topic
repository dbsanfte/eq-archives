You have to complete at least 6 of the initial skills before you can go onto the archetypal/class skills. <br>
<br>
So no, you can't get 5 aa points and grab the horse. hehe. Why would any paladin bother spending 3 points getting run3 if they could just get 5 aa points for the horse? <br>
<br>
I personally wouldn't suggest going the aa route until you hit 60 however. Unless you want to get run3 which is semi valuable, I still wouldn't recommend it particularly. <br>

<br>
The most EFFECIENT thing to do is to spend the absolute minimum on AA before you are 60. Every time you level, you improve in about 20-30 ways (more hitpoints, more mana, more AC, more damage, more defensive skills, new spells, better resist rate, etc. etc.). When you get an AA skill, you get a small improvement (except in a few cases). Consider that a 60th level paladin is INSANTELY more powerful than, say, a 55th level character with even 40 AA points.<br>
<br>
The exception is Innate Run speed. This is a skill that can save your life. Even Run1 will make you noticably faster - enough that you can run away from unsowed mobs in dungeons.<br>
<br>
Getting an AA point takes the same raw experience as it does to get from level 51 to 52 (if I remember correctly). This means that AA points are MUCH faster to get in the high 50's than in the low 50's. Even at 56, I can get a blue bub of AA in 30 minutes or so. This would have taken an hour to do when I was 52. At 52 you can solo mobs that are, say, 40th level. At 60, you're soloing mobs that are closer to 50, so you're getting more experience per kill. Already the AA experience bar FLIES.<br>
<br>
So, wait until high level to work on AA, though you should pick up Innate Run Speed probably in the mid 50's.<br>
<br>
One final point in terms of effeciency. Do not split your experience between AA and levelling. This is THE most effecient you can take. By doing this, you are putting off both the reward of levelling AND the reward of the AA point. <br>
<br>
Another way of putting this is that if you put 10% toward AA, you are putting off your level by 10% and you aren't going to get your AA point anytime soon. Instead, go for your level until you get it (and a buffer) and then switch to AA until you get it. You'll maximize the improvement in your paladin per unit of time playing.<br>
<br>
If you care more about seeing both bars move, then go ahead and split your experience. Just know that you are giving up effeciency when you do this. Remember that that person who got their level faster because they went all experience is now going to get AA experience faster than the person who is still stuck in that level.<br>
<br>
For example, assume two 55 level paladins are soloing. One is doing 100% experience, the other is doing 90%/10%. The first is going to hit 56 faster than the second. From that point on (until the other person hits 56), the first paladin is going to rake in experience FASTER than the second (they are killing faster if fighting the same mobs or they are killing higher level mobs). If the second paladin continues the split, the first paladin will hit 57 much faster than the second and the difference in experience per hour is going to diverge again.<br>
<br>
AA skills will round out your character. Level lets you do things you could NOT have done. The difference between even a 56 and a 54 paladin is remarkable in terms of the things they can kill.<br>
<br>
AA points do not, by a long shot, rule all. If you were taking a person on a raid, would you rather have a 59 paladin with 3 AA or a 54 paladin with 80 AA? You'd be crazy to take the later. Crazy. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

The "get 60 first" crowd were primarily level 60 before aa points were introduced. After comparing exp rates between me prior to getting various aa skills and after, and comparing to other paladins, I'm even more convinced on the utility of AA skills prior to level 60. I have great equipment for someone in my position (non-guilded since February) due to smithing, but I had decent equipment before then to be honest.<br>
<br>
I have seen a HUGE difference in efficiency with aa skills, and even moreso after I got more FT items and a fungi (right now with BoT active, I regen 34 hp per tick standing, and 4 mana per tick even with the 4 per tick mana loss due to BoT). I have grouped with paladins during these levels that had similar equipment at various points, and noticed a HUGE difference in efficiency. Some things I would suggest you don't get, things like ND for instance are not worth sacrificing exp towards leveling, it is more efficient to do that when you get 60 and aren't getting more HP per level. However, increased hp/mana regen have been HUGE. Mental clarity 1 I had before I had any FT items, and it (by itself) increased my exp rate significantly due to me regenning more mana than the buffs I cast when soloing (VoM and IoN, or just VoM against live mobs, as Divine might just isn't worth the mana cost to me when soloing) and allowing me to never have to med anymore.<br>
<br>
The 4 hp regen I get through aa are huge as well, as I am never full health when soloing, and over an hour that's 2400 hp worth of healing. That's almost 3 and a half minutes worth of helm heals per 30 minute period. That is a 6.2% increase in mob killing time per hour. These things have been huge for me, and if it wasn't for losing 2 months to smithing, I would be 60 easy by now. I can get an aa point in 6-7 hours depending on luck, and with KEI and can push that closer to 5.5 hours. That isn't much slower than most level 60 paladins that are true soloing (i.e. not two or three boxing). I'm firm in my belief that if you aren't in a guild doing stuff requiring a level 60, doing some aa skills at 55+ is no detriment, and while not quite as efficient in terms of how long it would take you to get to level 60 with X aa points versus getting 60 first and then getting those aa, it makes it far more enjoyable.<br>

<br>
Level 60 has so many advantages over the other levels in 50, it might be difficult to fully understand them if a player has never had a lv60 character.  For example, at lv60 you get: lv60 spells, lv60 resists, wont lose minor % of group xp from level disparity, lv60 less aggro range (ie you can single pull in Fungus Grove and other mobs that you coudlnt at 59), easier to get a group (esp. a group with other fellow lv60s!), easier to join guilds/raids, and you dont need to level anymore (after sufficient buffer) so you can focus 100% on AA.<br>
<br>
Also, I notice you're level 57 with 18+ AA..you could easily be lv60 with a few AA and you'd certainly be making AA alot faster at 60 than you would at lv57.  At lv60 you can easily make a point a day just casually hunting, or if you are very focused and have the right setup 2-3 points a day is quite possible.<br>

<br>
<br>
First, let's ignore the fact that you must be 59 to get class skills.  Maybe you would want to buy class skills, but it is also possible to spend 80 on general/arch skills exclusively.<br>
<br>
The level 55 paladin would:<br>
<br>
Heal worse<br>
Melee worse<br>
Tank worse<br>
<br>
Even leaving all of that aside, I would take the 59 simply because the level 55 was so ignorant of the game as to question his ability to be an asset. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urorrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rorrak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 12:09:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=587.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gotta go by level</span><hr size=1> My foot is in both camps here but my weight is more on the foot in the &quot;60 first camp&quot;<br>

Abazagaroth is on the money when he says that regen cuts downtime. Downtime is your enemy.<br>
Run speed is your friend. The xp saved from deaths alone is probably worth it.<br>
<br>
but.....<br>
<br>
Romindar gave me a huge insight when he said I get 1 blue of AA in 30 minutes at 55.<br>
I get just a little over 2 in the same period solo. Just over 3 duo with my wife.<br>
<br>
but....<br>
<br>
Finding xp zones where light blues are not too prevalant is not as easy at 60 although I'm not sure how big a factor this really is since even in Seb where around 30% are light blue where we can Duo I make more XP than the level 55 example given above.<br>
<br>
Lastly....<br>
<br>
At 60 you get invites to fun raids that you wont get at 59 or lower.<br>
Can get into groups in zones like CT (new)<br>
Maybe its purely Yaulp IV but I really do hit quite a lot harder.<br>
It would not supprise me to find a new table at 60 like the one at 51<br>

That isn't the question, though. The question is whether they AT LEAST offset the time spent GETTING those AA points, and I do not see how that can be possible.<br>
<br>
I returned to the game in late April at level 50 and will be level 57 by this weekend (have 1 yellow to go at about 2 blues per evening). I also have run 1 thrown in there (which is enough to get away from non-sowed mobs; I pull in Chardok and I pull in Skyfire when we hunt there - have had my sow dispelled by damn chromadracs and still easily outrun them and everything else I've encountered there). I play about 4-5 hours per day on a good day but probably average about 4 hours per day during the week and about 8 hours per day on the weekend.<br>
<br>
7 levels in 3 months seems pretty good to me. When I came back, two of my close friends were 53 and 54. They are now 54 and 55, respectively, although they both have run3. I play more than the one who was 53 but about the same as the one who is now 55. They both were devoting 10% of their experience to AA for a long time, then switched to all AA.<br>
<br>
It's not a completely fair comparison, because out of the time I've been back I've soloed or duoed about 25% of it whereas they are always grouped. I'd much rather be 57 with run 1 than 54 or 55 with run 3. I can do things now that I couldn't do then (my wife, myself and our druid can now keep zone in of chardok cleared by ourselves and it has turned into a great spot to hunt in the mornings - all solid blues; we could not have done this when I was 55).<br>
<br>
I fully agree that those AA skills can make you more effecient. A 57th level paladin with a bunch of (good) AA skills is definitely better than a 57 paladin with none (or just run3). That is not in question. The question is this:<br>
<br>
Paladin A and B both ding 51st level at the same time. They then spend the same amount of time playing, killing the same mobs (i.e., at 51 they kill the same mobs, at 52 they kill the same, etc., even if they aren't 52, 53, etc. at the same time).<br>
<br>
Paladin A goes all experience, Paladin B puts some experience (either by splitting or by alternating) into AA. After 3 months, what level are the two paladins? Paladin A is going to be higher level than Paladin B and is almost certainly going to have better equipment than Paladin B. Paladin B is going to be killing the 5+x mobs faster than Palaidn A had killed them, but Paladin B has moved on to 5x+y mobs.<br>
<br>
The longer you wait to get AA, the less impact those points will have on how long it takes to level. Being higher level gives you access to more equipment (our group could barely handle ME a few weeks ago, but will be able to handle it easily in a couple of weeks), let's you do more things (as another poster mentioned, there are just places you don't go unless you're 59 or 60).<br>
<br>
Again, there's no right or wrong when deciding which is more fun for any particular person. Getting those AA points can be fun and then they make the subsequent levels less of a drag by reducing downtime. In terms of raw effeciency, however, level is just too important - for hybrids above everyone else (we get most of the goodies of a melee class + new spells).<br>
<br>
For myself, I plan to get run3 before 59 if only because I don't want to be the person holding everyone back when we're running through indoor zones (if not for that run1 would suffice). The hard part is going to be waiting to 60 to fill in my other AA skills and I'm not sure I'll be able to resist completely (immediate gratification vs. bigger reward).<br>
<br>
I've seen with my own eyes the difference a level can make in terms of pulling singly, and that alone is almost argument enough to level instead of AA. Three of us vs. 2 di'zok recruits is very hard and leads to downtime (even with parking one a couple of times). Pulling 1 at a time means extremely little downtime (no mana spent on rooting, no extra damage taken that has to be healed mid-fight, etc.). <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

So let's say you just dinged 55, know your class well, have decent equipment. To max out level 60 you need 150 hours of exp fighting. Now, to get regen3, run3, natural regen1, mental clarity 1 you need 10 aa points. Now let's say you get those aa as soon as you ding 55 (because it is a good level to do aa in as so many easy low hp mobs are still mostly dark blue, like lord/magus in lguk) so that you have the full benefit of them for leveling to 60.<br>
<br>
4 additional regen is 2400 hp per hour. 1 additional mana regen is 600 mana per hour. If you are fighting somewhere efficiently, this should mean 3 and a half minutes of helm heal for 2400 hp less you need to helm heal, and 3 minutes you don't need to med (added to standing regen you are at 1200 per hour, enough to offset the 700 per hour from VoM and IoN and stuns for casters, roots, etc). So you are dropping 6.5 minutes per hour of downtime (and making it of the same value of the remainder of your time, which still includes downtime itself). So you are basically increasing your rate of exp gain by 6.5/53.5 + 100% = ~12.2% increase in exp per unit time.<br>
<br>
So the 150 hours to get 150 blue bubs changes to ~133.7 hours. So you save ~16 hours of time. Not that great right? Considering the average pally spent probablu 90 hours to get those 10 aa points. So you got 74 hours of differential. Of course, you also have a 60 paladin with 10 aa's rather than just a 60 paladin. So for the average (non-two boxer) aa rate of a 60 paladin you are running 5-6 hours per aa. So 50-60 hours. So now you are really talking about a loss in efficiency of between 15 and 25 hours spread out over several months. Less efficient? YES! I have always fully admitted that. But it is a HELL of a lot more fun. That has always been my only point, it isn't like you lose THAT much efficiency by doing a few aa if you want. Leveling at 55+ is boring as hell, and some aa skills break the monotony for me. Sure I have 22 aa's at the moment (I'm still trying to decide whether I want to go for slay undead or not so haven't spent 4 yet), but I also was half an orange and 18 aa's 12 days ago, and now I'm one and a half orange into 57 and 22 aa's. Perhaps I do play enough that a lot of it is a moot point for me, as I will get to 60 eventally without much trouble, but I just have a problem with saying doing aa before 60 is dumb. Is it the most efficient? Nope. But it is fun, and it can be helpful enough to offset a lot of lost efficiency, just not all of it. I play for fun, so....<br>

<br>
So at level 53 its the same as level 60 or level 51. The reason its so much easier to get at 60 is because 1) you are so much more powerful at 60 - hence mobs go down to you much easier, and 2) because you can solo higher level mobs at 60 receiving greater exp per kill. <p>Crusader of Tarew Marr

I mean whats it all about ?</span><hr size=1> The thing is, levelling ONE level will increase your effeciency by more than 10%. <br>
<br>
I mentioned that my wife and I have been fighting Chardok a lot. There are about 8 mobs in the zone in tunnel that, on xegony at least, are considered a camp (2 of them are sometimes pulled by people at the fort/caste/gate). When I was 55th level, my wife, our druid and myself could not keep up with the spawn due to downtime. We could kill between 4 and 6, depending on the combination of mobs.<br>
<br>
When I levelled to 56, we could suddenly handle the entire spawn of 8 easily and would even pull from the fort area when it was not camped. As you know, we don't even get very good new spells at 56, yet our effeciency close to doubled (it's even better now with a DW BP - we could clear the zone in and the fort in a cycle).<br>
<br>
That increase in effeciency came, in part, because I can single pull EVERY TIME. Most of the spawns are sort of in pairs (and the pathing often ensures that one spawn will walk over the other when you pull). At 55, pulling 2 at once was by far the norm - one level reversed it.<br>
<br>
I made up a list of things you get when you level (though I'm sure I've missed a few):<br>
<br>
Greater Damage Output:<br>
1. More Offense.<br>
2. More Weapon Skill.<br>
3. More Double Attack.<br>
4. Weapon Damage Bonus goes up.<br>
5. More likely to do more damage to opponent (this is separate from increase in Offense/Weapon Skill) in a single hit.<br>
<br>
Greater Durability.<br>
6. More hitpoints.<br>
7. More Defense (higher AC).<br>
7. Higher Dodge<br>
8. Higher Parry<br>
9. Higher Riposte (could include this in &quot;higher damage&quot; as well).<br>
10. Fewer maximum damage hits from opponent (this is in addition to defense points).<br>
11. More resistant to opponent's spells.<br>
<br>
Spell Improvements:<br>
12. New spells (not always a real improvement).<br>
13. More mana (though this is not particularly an increase in soloing ability).<br>
14. Higher spell skills (fewer fizzles, fewer interrupts).<br>
15. Higher meditate (when does this stop going up?).<br>
16. Fewer resists from same opponents (this also means root spells will last longer).<br>
<br>
Other Improvements:<br>
17. Disciplines at some levels (well, ok, not really an improvement where paladins are concerned. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
18. Greater ability to pull solo.<br>
<br>
The improvements upon levelling are just immense. Just increasing your DPS through a change in your damage bonus alone can be a several percentage point improvement in damage done (depending on your equipment), since you'll apply those extra damage points on every swing.<br>
<br>
As I said, I agree that those AA points increase your effeciency but getting them takes time from levelling - which would have increased your effeciency even more. Now, as levels take longer and longer to get, i can certainly see the relief of doing AA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

And until you get some level 60 paladins that got a lot of aa in their mid 50s, I don't have much real reason to believe something that goes against what I see myself. At level 55 and the beginning of 56, I was killing 6-8 Sun revs on the plateau in SD per cycle. The rest of 56 and in 57 I kill 7-10 per cycle. The variance mainly comes from how much the named resist fear. The upgrade happened when I got a fungi. There hasn't been any difference in efficiency from 56 to 57. Wooptiedo, I get a little more ac. Wooptiedo, I get a little more hp. Wooptiedo I get a little more attk. Levels in no way affected my rate of exp gain on the SAME mobs. A fungi did, but that's a whole different story. I'm sorry, but single pulling is a non-issue 99% of the time. If you can't single pull you are probably fighting in a place too high for you anyway. You should be killing in places where mobs are about to turn light blue.<br>
<br>
I am telling my experiences in getting aa skills from level 52 to level 57. Not from the perspective of someone level 56 with run2, not from someone level 60 when luclin came out. And I am telling you that getting AA skills prior to 60 is NOT as bad as the vast majority of people (most of whom have no experience with the issue btw) claim. Take a look at the thread on "How many AA do YOU have?" or whatever it was called. Look at the rate of aa point gains by people not two or three boxing. They are getting them from 5-7 hours per point. I can do that right now at level 57. I could do it in 6-8 hours per point at level 55. So how am I gaining aa so much less efficiently? Sure, Iustus can get an aa in 2-3 hours with TWO ungrouped characters healing, adding DS etc, but what about Joe Blow Paladin at level 60 in gimp guild X that takes 14 hours to clear the regular mobs in Fear?<br>
