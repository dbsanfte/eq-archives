There is little thought put into his posts and he rarely replies to all the rebuttals made against them. He either likes to troll or is forever stuck in a state of naiveness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its the truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Those that stay must be the ones who actually still have fun. That is my thoughts on this whole matter, live with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your thought is wrong, it is not the truth. Live with it. A lot of people still play not because they still have 'fun', but because they've put in so much time into the game that quitting would be a bigger loss. Others don't want to lose the social circles they've made in this game even though they hate their class, hate VI/Sony's policies, hate the endless timesinks and exp grinds, etc. A lot of people that are disgusted by the game and the company behind it but still trudge on won't be supporting another VI/Sony game unless they're ready to be dissapointed again or incredibly optimistic. These disgruntled customers are what producers really need to be worried about - the returning customer base. Sure, it may feel nice to milk your customer of his money for your short term satisfaction and profits, but what happens down the road when he tells his acquiantances and friends of his experiences and you not only lose his loyalty in the long term, but everyone he tells? Remember, while your average happy customer may tell a few others, your average unhappy customer will tell 8-15 others. Take a look at the huge thread by the ex-guide and especially all the disgruntled posts and threads on PON in the last 2 months and tell me this is not above normal? There is always someone to please, but there is definitely something wrong in light of all the upset player base voicing their thoughts. VI/Sony may not feel the pinch now, but years down the road, they very well may pay the price for the faults happening now.<br>
<br>
Personally, I've put in so much time into my character via equipment, levels, AAs, hanging out, making friends, raiding, timesinks, questing, GM events, that I want to continue to make use of what I've put in, regardless of my disgust for the rest of the game. <p>- Replay Promisekeeper, Crusader</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ureplay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>replay</A> at: 9/28/02 8:47:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utormarctruelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormarc Truelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/28/02 12:39:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> i love these threads they humor me. i consider myself an addicted player,  play 5+ hours a day for nearly 2 years. everytime there is a patch and something happens to paladins, intentional or not, half the community goes in an uproar and starts yelling the nerf bat hit, im quitting blah blah.. whats ironic is that MOST (read NOT all) of the same people continue to play just to do the same thing next patch. it is a game, games are supposed to be fun.<br>
<br>
i do not buy the logic that logic that exp leads to new abilities, new abilities lead to new challenges, new challenges equals fun.<br>
<br>
people make it a job, not a game, they must cram 1 point or more in a sitting, they must get the best exp solo possible per kill, the most kills possible per hour etc. what ever happened to hangin with some buddies killin shit for fun and just relaxing? so maybe you get half a point at a time, is it that big a deal?<br>
<br>
certainly having more aa points makes high end things easier, but having max aa points isnt absolutley necessary, i have seen many people in top guilds that are only baron or arch titled because all they do is raid and dont have time to aa, they still get buy, its not the end of the world /shrug<br>
<br>
anyways, im not quitting yet, ive thought about it because my guild broke up and im not raiding atm, but not because of little things that happen to the paladin class in general, i dont care what people say it is a roleplaying game, even though the days of roleplaying in it are pretty much done, i made my paladin because i love being a a paladin and wanted to be one in everquest, not because its the most efficent soloer or anything. if i wanted to be a powerful solo character or a character that gets good fast exp i would prolly made a druid, or wizard or something. to each his own though.<br>
<br>
for the record, Verant is a business, they want to make money, can almost guarantee most things are accidental and get fixed, they wouldnt do something to lose half their customer base they arent dumb or out to get you like many think.<br>
<br>
to those that are still deciding to leave the game, good luck to you in the gaming world.<br>
<br>

You dont enjoy loggin on, sayin hi, see whats up with them?  <br>
<br>
And also, those who play this game when it isnt fun in anyway at all need to reevaluate their priorities in life.  Playing such a time consuming game like this and not enjoying it means u are wasting your time.  You are better off playing another game, or finding something else to do till either A. you want to try, and find u like eq again, or B.  You find a new game that is fun for u, so you dont agonize over a boring game.<br>
<br>
My opinion is right to me, and you got no right saying my opinion isnt right.  You can say its not your opinion, but that is it.  I value my power to post an opinion, so yeah, get used to it.  If you dont find my posts thoughtful and what not, o well, im not sorry you dont enjoy hearing something completely different than you think.  <br>
<br>
Blah blah blah, yadi yadi yada, post again later. <p><br>
