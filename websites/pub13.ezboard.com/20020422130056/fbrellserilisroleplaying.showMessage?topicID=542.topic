The great expanse of the Faydark or the vastness of East Antonica are filled with personality, brimming with people and lore. Some of the greatest light and most vile evil have passed through these areas.<br><br>But sometimes, those with a Path are not born among the metropolis.....<br><br>A human Wizard had traveled to Felwithe and met a wood elf Ranger. Both loved the rain and all of nature. They spent many days hunting together, wandering the Plaines of Karana, and assisting those in need of aid. As they grew in wisdom and power, so did their love.<br><br>Fortune is not without her humor, but Fortune is only master of coincidence and luck. Fate looked upon the union, and worried.<br><br>For you see at the time, this partnership was viewed as a tainted one. The wood elf Rangers were proud of their heritage, to the point of denying the great love. The human Wizards also fell victim to hubris. Perpetual underdogs, and overproud of their successful non-elven Wizards, they too refused the union.<br><br>Rejected by their guilds, and seemingly forsaken by their God and Goddess, the Wizard and Ranger fled to the isolation and quiet of Surefall Glade. Making their home in a deep cave, the only light that shone on their once happy lives was the news that a child would come to them.<br><br>Far away from the docks of Freeport or the orc slaying heroes of Crushbone, a half elf was born. They called her Juniper. <br><br>The birth did not go unnoticed by some factions, for at this time poachers had entered the Glade. Murdering bears and wolves, the two most sacred animals of the Druids, the poachers had little regard for life. They sought only the money furs would provide. Lead by the Miller siblings, the poacher's knife stained the ground of Surefall with innocent blood. <br><br>The Wizard and Ranger sensed their refuge was under attack. They defended the Glade, but were overwhelmed by evil. The poachers were cunning and cruel and the love of the human and wood elf faded, as the pools in Surefall turned red with their life. The Millers, having inspected the caves, did not hear the crying girl. <br><br>She stood there, gazing through the waterfall at her parent's bodies. Why hadn't Karana sent his rain? Where was Tunare to protect her children's home?<br><br>But they were there, standing beside Juniper in her anguish. They tried to speak to her, but in her grief she could not hear them. The God and Goddess looked at each other. Tunare touched Juniper's shoulder, and blessed her.<br><br>&quot;The wolf and bear will not harm you,&quot; and the great Goddess returned to her Plane.<br><br>&quot;You will fight with the power of the tempest,&quot; said Karana, and vanished to watch over the dark forest of Kithicor.<br><br>Juniper cried, cursing the gods she could not see were there. She collapsed into a deep sleep, not feeling the presence of yet another divine entity in the Glade....<br><br>No evil came near her, and darkness kept its distance from her dreams, for she slept surrounded by flames which did not burn.<br><br>And that is how the Druids found her, bathed in the painless fire. The Druid Master was confused at first, for Juniper had not been openly marked by Karana or Tunare, yet the animals loved her and plants responded to her touch. The Glade Masters also noticed Juniper's tendency to gaze into the hearth fire, almost able to manipulate the chaotic flame.<br><br>&quot;She is different,&quot; one said.<br>&quot;Yes, not like the others.&quot;<br>&quot;We must petition the Gods to find her Path...&quot;<br><br>And so the druidic circle gathered in Surefall, to pray for Juniper. But the deity who came to them was not benevolent Tunare or the wondrous Rain Keeper. A tall, powerful man came to them, his face covered by a helm, and wielding a wand made of rubies. The circle watched as he stepped toward them, leaving a path of charred grass in his wake. A wave of apprehension came over the circle.   <br><br>&quot;I am Solusek Ro, and I am her god. She is blessed with my fire,&quot; he gestured toward the cabin where Juniper was sleeping. The druidic master from Kelethin stood up as if to protest.<br><br>&quot;You!&quot; The Burning Prince rounded on the wood elf. &quot;You would have her spend her days catering to the wishes of others! This is not her Path.&quot; The circle remained silent.<br><br>&quot;Surely you can see her father's fire in her eyes. He believed in the flame. Her fire you see, is mine.&quot; <br><br>The ground around Solusek Ro was scorching, and the circle watched as a pillar of fire taller than mountains surrounded the god. The sky above the glade turned scarlet red, and Solusek Ro vanished.<br><br>The druid from Kelethin walked over to the burned grass. Lying on the ground was a spell scroll and a plain Scimitar. The Heartwood Master opened the scroll, and read the runic message.<br><br>&quot;It is Ignite,&quot; he said. The circle began talking of Juniper and her fate. The moon moved high into the sky before a decision had been made.<br><br>&quot;So, it is settled. She cannot stay here. Pack her a sack of provisions, and tell her to go to Freeport,&quot; said the Glade Master.<br><br>&quot;But Madam,&quot;  said the Rivervale druid. &quot;She will most certainly die on the way!&quot;<br><br>The Glade Master ignored this, and returned to the cabins. <br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaffryn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saffryn</A>&nbsp;
