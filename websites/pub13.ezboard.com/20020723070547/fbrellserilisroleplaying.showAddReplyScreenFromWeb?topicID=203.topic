<br>
There comes a time in everyone’s life where they find themselves at a nexus of possibilities, and they know, deep in their soul, that the decision they make in the next heartbeat will affect the course of their life forever.<br>
<br>
This is about such a moment.<br>
<br>
Raff had been following the dark elf for over 20 minutes as he wound his way through the city streets.  The thick white mist hadn’t lifted and Raff had to stay close to the elf or he’d be lost.  Somewhere in the distance he heard a man shouting something about the time, and how the bars were closing.  As they walked, their footsteps echoed eerily in the whiteness.  Finally the elf stopped outside a small wooden house.<br>
<br>
“This is it” he smiled.  “Soon you and Glorias will be back together Raff.  Soon your life will be complete again”.<br>
<br>
Raff shook his head to try and clear it.  The white mist made him feel as if he was half asleep.  “What’s here?” he asked groggily.<br>
<br>
The dark elf smiled and reached for the door.  “Your destiny is here Raff.  Inside lies the beginning of the rest of your life.”<br>
<br>
Raff looked at the house as the elf opened the door.  It looked like any other house, plain, wooden, a window here or there.  What’s so special about this? He wondered.  The door appeared to be unlocked and the elf opened it and started in.  He stopped, turned to Raff and said quietly “We must be silent.  We don’t want to wake anyone.”  He smiled and Raff thought, for a moment, the smile was just a bit too smug. <br>
<br>
Raff simply nodded and followed the elf inside the small house.  Inside he could hear the quiet snores of sleepers.  He was lead up a set of stairs and down a hallway to another door.  His footsteps were quiet on the wooden floor as he walked to the door.  Walking silently was something he had learned a very long time ago out of necessity.  His usual method of gathering money demanded it.  The door swung open quietly and the elf ushered him inside the room.  <br>
<br>
The mist wasn’t as thick inside the house, and Raff could make out most of the room.  There was a small dresser, with a washbasin on top of it.  The room had one window, directly across from the door.  Under the window was a small bed, obviously a child’s by the size of it.  He could make out the small shape of a child under the blankets. He tried to relax, allowing his arms to rest casually by his sides.<br>
<br>
“What am I to do here?” Raff whispered.<br>
<br>
The elf removed a large knife from a scabbard on his hip and sat down in a chair beside the bed.  He pointed to the figure in the bed with the blade of the knife.<br>
<br>
“It’s very simple Raff,” the elf said quietly. “This child is an innocent, just like your wife was.  She’s done nothing wrong, just like your wife before she was brutally killed by the orcs.  Erollisi is powerful, but with every power there is a balancing power.  I can restore Glorias if you can give me something to trade for her.  This girl will do nicely.”<br>
<br>
“You want me to kill a kid?  Are you insane?”  Raff barely managed to keep his voice at a whisper.<br>
<br>
“Don’t think of it as killing.  The girl is innocent. She’ll go directly to Marr, and be better off.” <br>
<br>
The elf shifted slightly and leaned forward as if he was just getting to the exciting part of a story told around a campfire.  “But, if you don’t kill her, she’s going to grow up very poor and struggle all her life.  You can save her a lifetime of pain and suffering!”  He sat back casually and waved the knife lazily at the sleeping girl. “Her father just lost his job today, and tomorrow he’s going to attack the owner of the bakery he works at.  During the battle, her father will die, but so will his boss.  Tomorrow night, the son of the bakery owner will come and enact revenge on this girl’s mother.  I’m afraid this son isn’t such a nice fellow.  After he kills the mother, he’s going to do some very unpleasant things to this fragile little girl.  She’ll live, but her life will be a living hell as she wanders the streets looking for somewhere to sleep and something to eat.”<br>
<br>
He held the knife out, tilting it back and forth, watching how the light fell on it’s keen edge. “Soon she’ll turn to prostitution because it’ll be her only choice.  By the age of 14 she’ll be pregnant and another child will be born into this world without a fair chance.”<br>
<br>
“I don’t believe you” Raff whispered, an edge to his voice.  “How can you possibly know this?”  Raff stood rigidly, his hands stiffly at his sides.  His face was drawn into a tight expression of seriousness.<br>
<br>
The elf smiled warmly.  “I know the future Raff.  Creatures like me always do.  You want proof?  Here.  Within 10 seconds this little girl will roll over onto her back.  Then you’ll hear a dog bark and someone will yell at it to stop.  A few seconds later, you’ll hear a call for closing time at a bar.”  He sat back in the chair calmly.<br>
<br>
Raff waited tensely.  A moment later, the child stirred in bed and rolled over to her back.  A dog barked in the distance.  Then he heard someone yelling at the dog.  He narrowed his eyes as he heard another voice shout asking all the people in his bar to leave because it was closing time.  He moved toward the elf and stared at him.<br>
<br>
“Fine, so you can predict some things.  Good for you.  That doesn’t mean a thing. You could still be lying about the kid.<br>
<br>
Again the elf smiled warmly.  “You’re absolutely right Raff.  You’re a damn clever guy, I’ll grant you that.  But think of this.  Who cares?  You’ve killed your fair share of people before.  You even killed a bartender tonight because he suggested you worship that bitch Marr.  What does this child mean to you?” He licked his lips and held the knife up toward Raff.  “Who gives a damn about one kid?  She’s nothing.  Kill her and have your life back.  It’s that simple.”  He stood up and moved within an inch of Raff, his eyes locking with the human’s.  “Raff, you’ve done much worse before.”  <br>
<br>
He held the knife up between them, just to the right.  “I promise you, you’ll have everything you wish for, your life will be where is should be.  Erollisi took Glorias from you.  Damn her.  Take your wife back.  Take your life back.”<br>
<br>
Raff scowled and took the knife from the elf and turned to the sleeping girl.  What does this child mean to me? He thought.  She’s nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Glorias was everything!  She’s nothing!  He took a step forward toward the bed.  He could feel the elf’s hand on his back, encouraging him to do the deed.  Raff turned the knife over in his hand and examined it.  It was over six inches long and ornately carved out of a strange metal that looked like dark silver.  Large gems were embedded in the handle apparently meant to resemble the eyes of creatures carved into it.  The creatures along the handle were raised in sharp edges.  The gems themselves were delicately cut into sharp points.  He gripped the knife in his right hand firmly and felt a slight tingle along his arm.<br>
<br>
“Go ahead,” the elf said soothingly.  “Glorias awaits you Raff.”<br>
<br>
Raff took another step toward the bed and held the knife over the sleeping child.  He looked down at her and tightened his grip on the weapon.  He could feel the sharp gemstones and carved images cutting into his hand and he squeezed harder as if the pain might give him strength.  He estimated the girl to be about 7 years old.  Her blonde hair was tossled around her delicate face.  Carefully he reached down with his left hand to pull back the covers from the girl.  Slowly he lifted them and quietly pulled them down until they only covered her from the waist down.  She was wearing a pink nightshirt with white flowers on it.<br>
<br>
He looked back to her face and gripped the knife tighter in his hand.  He could feel the flesh of his hand being cut from the sharp handle.  Just one thrust and it’ll all be over… he told himself.  Slowly he willed his hand higher. He noticed he had stopped breathing and exhaled with a ragged silence.  His heart was pounding in his chest, and he wrapped his left hand around his right, squeezing the knife handle harder.  He closed his eyes and thought of Glorias.  He saw her smiling, walking up to him, holding him.  He saw her pull a strand of hair from her face and smile at him.  He saw them embracing. He felt his happiness at being with her again.  He squeezed the knife tighter and lifted it above his head.  Glorias was there.  She was looking at him.  She smiled and touched his face.  She kissed him and said thank you dear, thank you for killing that child for me.<br>
<br>
His eyes snapped open and his arms trembled with exertion.  Glorias’s voice came to him again.  Thank you for killing that child for me.  He gasped and shut his eyes again.  You were right dear. She said. She deserved to die, and I deserved to live.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
With a shout of pain and anger Raff whirled around and drove the knife deeply into the right eye of the dark elf, embedding the long knife to the hilt.  The elf crumpled to the floor without a sound, an expression of complete shock on his face.  <br>
<br>
Raff tried to slow his breathing, but his trembling body made regular breathing almost impossible.  He turned to look at the girl and was relieved to see she had remained sleeping during the entire event.  He slowly pulled her blankets back to her shoulders using his left hand while he held his other hand away from the bed.  He held his right hand tightly closed to slow the bleeding cuts caused by made by the knife handle.  Somewhere in the distance he heard the same man shouting about closing time and how everyone had to leave the bar.<br>
<br>
As he looked down at the girl’s face, he thought about her future.  If the elf was right, she would have a terrible future.  He looked to his hand where he still wore his wedding ring.  It was a large silver ring with the markings of Erollisi Marr upon it.  It wasn’t a fortune, but it was all he had.  He was able to pull the ring off easily, using the blood on his right hand acted as a lubricant.  Once he had it off, he wiped it on his robe and placed it on the chair next to her bed.<br>
<br>
Without a sound, he left the house.  The mist outside was even thicker than it had been before, and after a few steps, he was engulfed by it.  He walked blindly, his hands out in front of him, desperately searching for something to guide him along.  Suddenly he felt something strike his legs and he felt himself spinning and then falling.  Dammit!  The well!  He thought.  He felt his head strike something hard and then the slow coldness of water soaking into his clothes.  As he sank in the cold water, his eyes filled with red and dizziness overtook him.<br>
<br>
The last thing he remembered before everything went black was the distant voice of a bartender telling his patrons to leave the bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey friend, ya gotta get movin'&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff lifted his head slowly from the table, a thin string of saliva trailing from his lip. He opened blood-shot eyes, peered weakly at the bartender, and blinked.<br>
<br>
“I said you gotta get outta here” the balding bartender said, a scowl breaking out on his face.  “Yer tha last ones here, an I wanna get home.”<br>
<br>
Raff looked up at the large man and blinked again.  He put a hand to his head, looking for blood or a bruise from the wound he just suffered in the well, but found nothing.  He stared open mouthed at the bartender, unable to speak.  A dream… it was a dream!.  He stood up slowly, wobbling slightly in his drunken state.  He heard a moan from his left, coming from the woman with him.  “Come on dear, we have to get you home” he said.  “The coins on the table are yours to take.”<br>
<br>
He looked back at the bartender and tried to smile. “We’ll be out of here in a second, friend.”  The large man simply folded his arms and waited for the two to get out from the table and leave the bar.  Raff helped the woman get up and lead her outside.<br>
<br>
The night was cool on their skin as they made their way through the streets of Freeport.  Raff walked in stunned silence until they reached the brothel where the woman spent her “off duty” nights.  “Good night” he said simply as she entered the four story building. He watched the door close behind her and then turned to find a place to sleep himself.<br>
<br>
Four streets, and two alleys later Raff was sitting down curled up against a stone building, shivering in the cold air. He wrapped his cloak tight around himself and was just about to close his eyes when he glanced at his left hand.<br>
<br>
His wedding ring was missing.<br>
<br>
Raff’s eyes widened in shock.  He stared at his ring finger.  The ring was one of his most prized possessions.  The skin on his finger showed clearly where the ring had been for many years with a puffy whiteness that contrasted sharply with his dirty skin.  Slowly, as if he was afraid of what he might find, he turned his eyes to his right hand and opened it gingerly.  On the palm of his hand were the unmistakable marks of the jeweled knife he had held in the dream.  His hand was completely healed, but the scars remained.  As he stared at his hand, he felt a warmth fill him, and he stopped shivering.  There, in the fog of the night, he struggled to find some meaning in the dream.<br>
<br>
Sleep was long in coming to him that night.<br>
