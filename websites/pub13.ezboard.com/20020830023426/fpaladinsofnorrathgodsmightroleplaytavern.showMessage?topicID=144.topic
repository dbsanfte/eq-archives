 My master has advised me to keep a journal of events here, he has not the time to do so. Poor man is too spared for time to even have nightly drinks with me anymore, but he is far important a man to have any free time. I am Zipparian Badgerbane, a halfling warrior in service to my master, Lord Soulforge, a paladin of Tunare. I shall start from the begining. I first met my master when I was very young. I had made my journey from Rivervale to the human city of Freeport. A large city, but not pleasant like home. I was shocked by the sites of this city. The sites I am afraid to say, were not pleasant ones. An ogre ran his shop freely, smells of gross pickles came from his cart. The Teir'Dal, my people's most hated enemy came and went openly through the gates of this city. I shocked beyond belief. Here I thought the humans were against their dark kind. In my moment of surprise i got careless and pumped into a deeply robed figure. I spun around to see the glowing red eyes flash at me and blue hands reach out and host me by my collar into the air. The voice of this Teir'Dal rang in my ears &quot; Halflings, the most useless of any species. The most that I wish to see die by flames.&quot; The Teir'Dal did not speak to me, he spoke to a human women next to him, she was carrying a great staff, with a human skull at the end of it. She was clothed in extravagant garments, pure silk by the look, but magically altered to give it even more eye appeal. She spoke &quot; My love this little one seems lost, peraphs we should help it.&quot; Her voice was sweet as honey to the ear. I am no fool, I looked into the eyes of this women, They were cold, dead of life, yet cold like with a hunger, hunger for cruelty, pain, things this monster in a womens form would consider fun. The dark robed Teir'Dal smiled a pearly white grin.&quot;Yes, I think we can help it.&quot; Being past my moment of surpise I quickly grabbed this dark elf's arm and kicked with all my might at his hooded head. The kick missed, but surprised him enough to alloy me to struggle free and unsheathe my sword. There I stood, certinaly doomed unless a miracle happened, and in this corrupt city I saw no chance for yelling for yelp. The women laughed evilly, the Teir'Dal moved to the side, and with too swift a move for me to counter pulled fourth a curved dagger from his robe sleeve. The swiftness of the blow and the shear power of my opponent was too great, I new I was doomed. Never being a halfling of belief in any god, I just raised my sword and prepared for the end. I waited, and waited some more....nothing. I opened my eyes, the Teir'Dal was frozen in motion, unmoving. I stared at him with wide eyes. Thinking maybe this to be a cruel trick. Then a voice rang out &quot; Move quickly!&quot; I did so quickly as my halfling speed aloud, which is saying quite a bit for halflings. Seconds after I had moved aside the blade of the Teir'Dal came down in full stroke. He looked to the spot that I should be lying dead, but looked puzzled at the spot I was not at, then over to where I was. Anger filled his eyes, a spell began on his lips. A bright piece of steel suddenly appeared before the Teir'Dals throat. A man extravigantly armored and powerful by his looks held a large sword across the Teir'Dals throat. He was a high elf, a paladin of his race I could tell just by the look of him, said to be the greatest of the Norrathian races. I had never seen such a creature before, I nearly took him for some messenger for the gods. It was not until much later, that I would learn how true this statement was. <br>
<br>
Did in kinda a rush, sorry about that, but will make more time to do better. Stay Safe, lvl well, more coming soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzipparian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zipparian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 5:42:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> War in the commons, journal of a lackey.2</span><hr size=1>  The high elven Paladin flicked his blade upward, making the Teir'Dal's head look up directly into his eyes. The Teir'Dal looked at him with an expression of fear, but one more of deeper hate, for a Teir'Dal to be overcome by a high elf is unbearible torment. My rescuer spoke, &quot; Now vile servant of Innoruuk, I recomend you leave my little friend here alone, and leave this city at once. If I see you again withing these walls again, I will send you to meet your dark god forever.&quot; The Teir'Dal said nothing. My rescuer sheathed his sword and motioned for me to walk over to him. We quickly walked away from the site of the inncident.&quot; You are lucky to be alive my friend. These two I have seen in town much. No good comes from being anywhere near them.&quot; I ran to catch up to my hero. &quot;Excuse me m'lord.&quot; The paladin turned to face me. &quot; I never got your name.&quot; He smiled brightly beconed for me to follow him. &quot; My name is Avethar Soulforge&quot;, I mummered the name a bit to memorize it then replied. &quot; I am Zipparian Badgerbane m'lord, warrior halfling from Rivervale. I have to tell you how gratefull I am that you saved me, I was no doubt no match for those two. And Id like to repay you with a drink at the bar.&quot; The paladin stopped a moment then stared at me for a while. &quot; I would like to have a drink with you my friend, but I am pressed for time, a ship leaves for Butcherblock mountains soon and I must be on it. But if you are so bent on repaying me I would be happy to have you come along with me. I am heading back home to Felwithe.&quot; I could barely believe my luck, here I was almost about to die and now I am going to the High Elf city itself. &quot;Felwithe! I would love to go with you!&quot; That day we prepared for our departcher, packed our bags with food, water, and other items for our needs. Avethar spoke with a small group of greatly armored people, other paladins I guessed, from the looks of them from the Temple of Mar. Mar paladins and other followers are at war with the Militia, this I had heard in Rivervale, but had no idea why until today. They completely opposed what the militia was allowing, and tried desperatly to stop it, but they were loosing slowly. The Militia was too great in numbers and backed by the Teir'Dal and other foul species. Avethar said goodbye to them. We boarded our ship and began our journey through the sea of Tears. Those sites are ones that I will never forget, the huge sea, the sister island with its small inhabitants. While on board a sea giant actually passed by the ship, luckily it was not stupid enough to attack the boat. The boat carried many others, some paladins, mages, a few warriors in the back, and a Rogue, he sat with the warriors, which I noticed that their purses kept on getting smaller and smaller all night. We both slept under the stars that night, on the top deck. We prepared our dinner that night with what we had bought from Freeport. Avethar removed fruits, water, and other items from his backpack. One of excellant quality I could tell. I was very hungry, and unloaded my stuff. Gentle I pulled out my double decker berry stuffed thin crust pie. Then my keg of ale. Avethar stared with mouth open at me. &quot; Im sorry, did you want some&quot;, I passed him a spare keg I had stowed away, not as large as my own, but enough for one. The next day we reached Butcherblock, an odd name I always thought. We never passed the dwarven city, we cut across the wilderness straight to the elven lands. There I felt a wee bit more at home, the trees that were too large to see the tops of reminde me much of outside Rivervale. We came upon a fork in the road we followed from the start of the elven lands. There I almost fell off the hill when I saw the High Elven city. Walls of shining white, towers that rose high up into the air, higher than anything in Rivervale, guards in bright helms standing watchful at the gate. I saw many wonderouse sites as we approached the city. Other high elves came and went out of the gate, a noble couple, both on horseback, rode into the city. Others besides the high elves were around. Woodelves came and went, but not many, most rangers, with bows and quivers at their backs. A pack of druids came up to us. I say a pack because all were in wolf form. They danced happily about Avethar, he picked up a stick and they all went after it. He seeming very pleased to be home conversed with all that came to the gate and kept the pack of druid happy by letting them have steaks he had bought from Freeport. We entere the city, far ahead of him. He showed me the sites of the great city, happy shops, beutiful rose bushes and great buildings for all kinds. That night we stayed at an inn. He had packed away his armor and sold it to a merchant nearby. This I thought was very odd. He had then asked for my sword and minor items to be sold as well. This I was happy to oblige since all were of no use to me now. Accept my food and keg of course. He sat down next to my stool that night. He said in very seriouse, and calmed voice, &quot; Zipp(that being his name for me) tomorrow me and you are going to the city's blacksmith, i have arranged for me and you to be equiped with armor and weapons there.&quot; I smiled happily at this news. But stayed silent, as I new this was not all he had to tell me. &quot; From here you must make a choice, I must now resume where I left off, I am not as strong a paladin as you think my friend. Good enough to be trusted with small errands and letters. But not one as to do any serious work, that is why tomorrow I am to be equiped and resume to advance my skills. You choose what to do after I start this, either part my company and go your own way, for mine will be very hard, or follow me, allow me to train you as best I can.&quot; The room fell silent for a long while, until I came to a decision. I new what I was choosing, the life of a paladin is very differant from that of a warrior. And beging trained by a paladin in warrior ways, I could never hope to be something great, as is most warriors dreams. But I sat there that night, looking at a flickering flame of the candle, and I pondered all the thing in my life that I would miss if I stayed. Nothing came to mind. No family, all dead by Teir'Dal attacks and ambushes. My own small guild would never care that one more warrior has left, expecially one that is so low skilled. True I would be a lackey only, probably until the day I died. Thankfully I am a halfling, and have more logic in these kinda decisions. &quot; Ill follow you then, but on one condition, you pay for all Ale, Pie, and other alcoholic expences.&quot; Avethar keeled over on the floor laughing so hard his sides began to hurt and his face turned red. &quot;What?&quot; I said rather puzzled. <br>

They saw in him greatness that would come with age. Training was followed by several of his commrades buying him drinks at the local bar. They never thought to invite me, the lone lackey, even though they offered to put all my master's bill on their tab. You can imagine their surprise when 7 kegs of ale were added the next day. <br>
<br>
     The years passed very quickly, my master and I journeyed from one place to another, both growing in strength and skill. My master's became such that he was asked to journey to the colony of Fironia Vie, to help establish its defenses. I will always smile when I think of the time we spent there. My master ever busy would ask an officer where Zip was, the officer would say that I was OverThere somewhere riding wild rhinos. Who new that simple phrase would ever catch on. By the time we had left Kunark both my master and I were talked about very often. And for good reason, the once rag tag paladin and his little halfling lackey had accomplished more than anyone thought could be done in the time we were given. We had won respect threw countless defense of the city and counter attacks that were put in books for future reference. We both stood upon the deck of the ship, magnificent figures that we were. This I hold no modesty to, because we have gained what we hold only threw our strength and shear skill. I stood with no rusty weapon or cloth armor, but a warrior full clad in armor and weaponry that seemed to whisper of ancient power and long forgotten arts. Men who sighted my helm thought of a man who commanded legions and held the utmost respect of all who meet him. Its always funny when I get closer that they gok and stare at a halfling. My master I can describe a bit better. For I have watched him closely over the year. He stood the most impressive figure of all, not easily missed on any field of battle, a presence that called all to attention by a simple glance. He wielded sword of flame, one which only the greatest of paladins can bare. His armor seeped with holy magic, his helm reflected the sun and bore light to where ever his gaze was set. He bore this with the skill and wisdom to understand it, and the raw fury to use it. He at the paladin's 59th level , and I at my 55th. This I would always be in envy of him. For even with my own great skills, one thing that I have always wanted. His ability to heal and wield holy power, a sure reminder that his god was always there. For me there is nothing like that, men who are born such have that gift, it cannot be taught or given. Though I tried so many times those first years, to stare at a scrape or cut and try desperately to heal it. But never to any avail, but I have accepted my fate, but still at times find myself staring at a bruise or scrape and pleading for it to heal. <br>
<br>
     I have no idea when men and elf started to give us titles, but it happened over time. Men whom I have never known and men I have known very long refer to me as General Badgerbane now. My master they refer simply to as Lord Soulforge. Yet no titles or armor can change what I am, and have always been. Zipparian, my lord's lackey and friend. <br>
<br>
     This next part that I write in my journal, is one that I do not expect many to belive, or understand. But you must belive one thing, that I do not lie when I write this. When my master and I returned from our long assignment we rested and relaxed in one of the city's finest rooms. It was there that this strange thing took place. I awoke late that night, the candle we had set was nearly down to its stub. I looked upon my master, sleeping soundly across the room. I began to close my eyes and rest my head, when I noticed the room seemed to dim. I stepped out of my bed and examined the candle, still not quite worn down, yet the room dimmed even more. The great white walls of the room suddenly went completely black. The hairs on my neck and feet began to stand on end, being a warrior and one non magic friendly, but well learned in the presence of such I tried to call to my master. My voice died in my throat. The black of the walls shone out all light, the candle was gone, only my master could I see, soundly asleep still. The wall then started to ooze down from all around, it covered my master. More hell bent on smothering out his life than the halfling that stood in the room. I tried then to attack this foul mess, but to no avail, I was frozen where I stood. Then from the where the window would have been a white light shot fourth. The light seemed to crack the wall and slit apart the black ooze. The crack then grew, it grew until the light had grown to burst from the walls. The black ooze was no more, obliterated in this light. Then the window of light grew to the size of a door, from a door to the size of a great gate. Suddenly a hand gentle came fourth from the gate. The hand was gentle and delicate. Rings of living flowers grew and blossomed again and again upon the fingers of its wearer. In the hand a great staff was held. One of twisting living wood that held a sphere of glowing light at its end.  A body emerged, one undoubtable feminine. Clothed in a dress that flowed like it was caught in some gentle breeze. Then the head, and the face. The face I cannot do justice in this book. The beauty to compare is one that no bard can to praise and no painting truly capture. It was just there, for moments in time burned in my memory forever and preserved there. She wore what looked like a crown upon her head, and hair that twirled and curled like alive, as it nearly touched the ground. <br>
<br>
     Now the thing that followed will sound very odd, and very stupid to most. Please try and keep and open mind, I was still very drunk, and very confused. I stared at this being and quickly regained my senses. I jumped upon the table and delivered a flying kick, and shouted INTRUDER! I being completely non skilled in any form of attack that involves leaving the ground, was suddenly held in midair and suspended upside down. The women touched my toe with her staff and I fell down. I recovered quickly and watched. The women simply giggled a bit and smiled at me. She knelt beside my master and gentle kissed his brow, as a mother does to her sleeping child. She straightened herself and looked at me very seriously and spoke, &quot; Little one you are very brave, and protect and look after your master well. For these reasons I have decided to tell you something, and to charge you with a mission.&quot; She turned her head again over to my master, looking with pity and hope at him, then back to me. &quot;  He is going to have to go threw something very terrible, as will all the world, but his will be at the head of it all. He is to be my fighter for a battle to come. And come it is very soon, even now the dark lords, Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, and Innoruuk have formed an alliance and move their forces to gain a stronghold over all other gods. Veeshan and Solusek Ro have remained out of this conflict, which is best. Even here in Felwithe many are not safe, your master and you were nearly killed by dark powers. I have banished what power they have here, how they had it to begin with is very disturbing.&quot; She then turned the the empty wall by the table, the wall vanished, in its place was a picture of a very large and busy port city. With great buildings all around what Zip new to be the Temple of the Marr twins at its center.&quot;He is to go to the human city of Freeport and protect it with his life, if that city should fall to the dark lords then they would have a stronghold to freely assail any place on Norrath they see fit. You my little friend are to accompany your master, and see to his safety and the defense of the city. The temple of my allies must not fall, if that beacon of good falls then so does the city. I must go now.&quot; With those words she turned, and stepped only one foot into the gate of light and was gone. Where the gate had been was again white stone. <br>
     <br>
     The candle was worn far past its nub, and morning light shot threw the window. Suddenly my master awoke. He shot from his bed with a look of amazement and surprise to see me already up. &quot; Zip, you will never belive what I just dreamed.&quot; I quickly grabbed my armor and his and placed them on the bed. And said very casually, &quot; So shall we go to Freeport immediately or stop by the paladin guild first?&quot; <br>

However I do have a couple of suggestions.  Never mention character levels in a story.  It takes away from the mood, causes the reader to lose imagination by applying a &quot;fixed position&quot; of the characters.  Simply describing the titleship, the respect of the people would have sufficed. <br>
Also in the end when Zip is writing in his journal he is speaking to the reader from a first person point of view.  When he is shown the Temple of Mar you switched to third person.  <br>
<br>
&quot;With great buildings all around what Zip new to be the Temple of the Marr twins at its center.&quot;<br>
<br>
Keep your point of view consistant.  Example:<br>
With great buildings all around to what I new to be the Temple of Marr twins at its center.  <br>
<br>
Besides the other minor grammatical errors you are doing a good job (I do not know if english is youe native language or not).  You sound like you enjoy writing and want to improve your weaknesses.  I dont mean to sound over critical, so I apologize if I come off that way.  Keep up the good work!  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=200899" target="_blank">Venjonexi Bloodmoon</a><br>45th Paladin of Tunare New Outriders<br>The Rathe<br>Everyman dies, not every man truly lives.

The final entry</span><hr size=1> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The days that followed that night were very busy. So busy that I hardly remember details, for three days the only thing I remember is sharpen my swords, check supplies and yell at people. The nobles of Felwithe and neighboring woodelves had all come together and decided my master's vision was indeed a true one. Armys were to be assembled and citys made ready for war. Avethar was to take command of one smaller army, composed of high elves, woodelves, and a few half elves. Mostly paladins filled the ranks. Warriors also came in steadily from all around, druids were assigned to each regiment as we made our way to Butcherblock docks. The druids came from the wilderness, joining our army over the nights we moved threw the countryside. We made our way to the Butcherblock docks three days after our deparcher from Felwithe. The ship had been checked over by dwarf shipbuilders and cleared of all cargo not used for our journey. The days at sea were ones spent to equiped and supply our soldiers. We sailed threw the Ocean of Tears cautiously, Rangers were positioned upon the crow's nest and high points of the ship with bows ready. Warriors were positioned around the rails, with throwing weapons at the ready. All casters were below deck. They prepared their spells and enchantments, while bards sang above, to bost moral. Prexus was a well respected god amongst us all, with his blessing we traveled his ocean. But even within the halls of Felwithe evil had found its way to us, we took no chances. Guards were posted around the clock, not giant nor fish came within a hundred yards of the ship without immedialty regreting wandering over. <br>
<br>
              The morning light broke over the stone ridges of the city of Freeport. From the rays of light burn markings could be made out on the walls of the city. And several dead civilians floated by. Its West port was completely in shambles. The dock was broken in half and parts of buildings smoldered with surpressed flame. Ranger's reported from the crow's nest, from the looks the militia seemed to have turned on the city at last. The Temple of the Marr twins still stood. But was attacked from both east and west, at this rate they would not last long. My master gave orders, and our attack would begin. Men formed ranks and casters steadied themselves behind them. The few bards took position behind. &quot; Spells up!&quot; Avethar shouted as he too stepped into the ranks. The casters mummbled words and bards began to blow upon horns that gave no noise. The hair on my feet began to stand on end. My master looked at me with a sly smile on his face, &quot;They wont see this one comming.&quot; he grinned now and raised his hand for the all to ready the decent off the boat. &quot; No ship could stop by safely enough to drop off troops, not with the docks smashed. Which is why the Militia hadnt brought as many troops to secure this area.&quot; I stared at him rather puzzled, then asked the question that was on all of our minds. &quot; So.....how are we going to land?&quot; He gave me another slight smile, &quot;We dont use the docks, we ram right threw.&quot; A massive turn of the ship followed by a huge gain in speed. The ship went head first into the demolished docks. It ripped threw the fishing shop and broke a huge chunk from the stone wall. Immediatly Militia began to sworm the ship,they stumbled out of bars and inns, it didnt take them long to get more men from the west side of the city. They climbed the edges of the hull, without orders or any knoledge of what was on the ship, they jumped upon the deck with swords drawn and spears at the ready. I could barely stop the laughter from leaping out of my throat as they stared blankly into an empty ship. A captian shouted orders and men began to run back down the way they had came. Several smaller bands went dock to the Eastern Gate. The now medium size band of militia surrounded the ship and began to fall into rank and depart. I could guess they thought this was some futile gesture made by the foreign races to destroy their dock and stop any attempt to invade. As the militia began to march off and the gate guards began to attend their cozy little card game, my master lowered his hand. The militia at the gate were cut down in seconds by the swords and daggers of our Rogues who had been hiding in the city for days before the attack. The ones at the bottom of the ship were suddenly confronted with wave upon wave of clashing and shining steel. The farthest captian began to give orders, but was silenced by several arrows lodged in his body. My master drew his flaming sword, the enchantment cast upon us all seemed to lift then, and the remaining Militia looked up in fear. A figure more impressive than any soldier stood upon the deck of a broken and crashed ship, the morning sun caught in his armor and seemed to set him albaze, a flaming sword held in his hand as waves of elven warriors sprang from the broken hull. He turned to me and laughed, &quot; Invis, works every time.&quot; <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The capture of East Freeport was not difficult. The Militia never saw us coming and no forces could be stationed in the great Ro desert that would stand a threat if left to bake there for a few days. Our rogues were sent to tell the Paladins of Mar that help had come. Guards were stationed about the city and we moved our war councel to the center of the temple. Surprisingly the remaining Militia were easily broken. Most seemed just fools caught up in the moments of war. Over half abandoned their ranks when it came time for all out war. The rest were crushed by our attacks and surprise attacks using the citys sewer systems. With the city liberated the sewers were then sealed off from all previouse sneak in points. The hiden guilds of shadowknights and evil rogues were quickly exterminated. Several Teir'Dal were found there, all were thrown in prison cells. There was little time to rejoice, for the bigger battle was yet to come. My master had transformed the city from a busy place of marketing and travel to a solid fortress. The north part of the city was left more open, the buildings in that part of the city were left to the clerics for hospitales and tombs if it ever came to that. Young warriors and paladins, all barely above the rank of squire were to assist the clerics with binding wounds and the gathering of ingrediants for anything they might need. Shamans were set up there as well, their potions could save the clerics what strength they would need to save another person's life. Two days after we had set up all preparations for the city, the Commons seemed to rumble with the sound of what the next night would bring. Folk who had lived in the Commons suddenly came fleeing from their homes at noon, pleading to be let in. When questioned they said that no wolf or bear stirred. The orc camps stationed along the rim were deserted, blood stains were smeared accross tents and flags, yet not a single body or any sign of them remained. The desert stood empty, all accept the desert and old ruins, ghoulish whales were reported to fill the air for the entire day. Their hellish song was sang again and again.  The people were sheltered within the company of the citizens in North Freeport. They would be safe there unless our defenses broke.<br>
             The night finally came, seemingly faster than seemed natural. The sun seemed to scream as it went down below the horizon, as if fallen from the sky and slain by an attacker. We kept the city walls lined with torches, mage's fire elementals paced back and forth from the walls, wizards and rangers held bow and spell ready from the rooftops. Then it finally began, from the darkness of the Commons, with no light of star or moon, they came spewing out of every dark hole. They grew from the shadows of the ground, and swung down from the tops of trees. Shadows bred hate's children. Teir'Dal flooded every corner of the Commons. Their undead minnions walked beside their human allies. Followers of Cazi Thule and Bertoxxulous lined beside the children of Innoruuk. When I stared upon the top of the Temple of the Marr twins I saw what they all were. Each a part of the dark god that they followed. From that holy rooftop I looked into the eyes of each of their followers, there I saw not the man or women, but the dark god that commanded them. Each stared back at me, wishing me to die, die in pain, die in fear. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is where my journal comes to date. I sit now at the top of the Temple of the Marr twins and await the out come of this all. Why I am sitting here while battle rages and lives at stake is something that makes me red with anger, and in bad need of a decent drink. My master took most of the army, most guards from East Freeport gate and dock. The same for the soldiers in the North. I was left behind, to my great dismay and near rejection of orders. But I will and cannot disobey my master now, not with so much at stake. I was left behind to guard the citizens and healers here in North Freeport, if any enemy were to penitrate the defenses or find a way threw the great desert then I must protect the people with my life, and find a way to save them. My master and the majority of the army are at the Western Gate, fighting the great army that has arrived. The fighting has gone on for three days and nights now. The first wave of the dark army was assailed with arrows and fireballs. More numerouse than drops of rain in the Karanas. The dark attackers smashed into the warriors and paladins guarding the gate. The great impact of it could be heard from where I am standing. Undead bones fell before paladin's holy blades. Teir'Dal blood was spilled at the edge of a warrior's sword. Druids staulked the walls of the city. Blasting and biting any creature that tried to scale the walls. But the enemy would not stop. They met our defenses with wave upon wave of foul undead. Never seninding in too many of their own people. The ones that died were slain twice, once in battle, the next after to ensure that they would not rise as undead. Avethar ordered that the abandoned cart full of old dry pickles be used to start a bonfire. To burn all bodys and remains of the enemy. Bertoxxulous was known to use disease and plague to win battles, he would not gain the chance this time. The few days of battle were not without our own great losses. The hospitles were packed with wounded, despite the fact that an entire block of homes made the hospitle. I myself had to go down this mourning and try as best I can to bind the wounds and keep alive as many as I could. My cloths were stained red with blood after. No bathing is allowed with fresh water, all water within the city must be kept for use, incase this seige lasts many months. I look at my shirt now, stained red, and almost bring myself to tears at the fact that several of them I could not save. A plague covered weapon, or some great posion, was already too far into them for me to save them. The life of a healer must be one of the hardest to bare. To know that when you fail, a life pays for it. Why the life of my master is so grand a one that I follow, for he is both warrior and healer. I still can smile though, threw the fact that despite great losses many lives were saved. already the old slums are being converted into a great tomb for the dead. Not what I would do by choice, but we have none, and I think they would be proud to be barried at the place they have died to defend. This latest night I stand upon the roof and gaze at the gate of the city. The dark army has again assaulted the gates, this time Im told by hardly any undead. But the best of the army. Dark warriors in full armor, sharpened steel and living flesh. The Necros and shadowknights now command their dark powers to drain the strength from warriors that they slay before them. Yet despite their dark powers I see the flaming sword of my master. His great blade cutting threw the darkness, at its edge bringing its holy fury down upon the heads of Teir'dal. From my rooftop view I see the flaming blade sever the head of a shadow knight that made the fools mistake to try and cast a spell on my master. The soldiers at the gates inspire by this fight harder and dark arts seem to slip and loose their affect on our army. But then my heart sinks back into my feet. The wave of battle turns again as more legions come down from the hills. The shadowknights and necros that were slain are replaced by massive figures, more huge than any human or elf. I breathed the word threw grit teeth, &quot;Trolls!&quot; Their huge forces crashed into my master's vangaurd. Few trolls that there were, they are massive enought to be ten times the worth to every one shadowknight. One hurled a great hammer over his head. The spot where my master should be was blotted out. I almost loose my hold upon the railing and fall over the edge of the rooftop. I gaze, searching, pleading with every good god whos name I know that he still be alive. Suddenly the troll drops his huge hammer, it crashes down and crushes a Teir'Dal behind. My master's flaming sword is lodged in the belly of the lead troll, and then pulled free from the belly of the brute. I shoot ten feet into the air and scream&quot;WOOTA!!&quot;. <br>
<br>
            Dear funny little book, after the great troll attack our numbers were cut in half. Counting both our human allies and our own elven forces. The dark army in the commons seems to hold no end. Threw the week wave after wave has still continued. None with the fury the troll attack brought. But every one consistant and never ending. My master broke several ribs in that great attack. The massive troll bodys had to be set aflame where they laid. Fire elementals were nestled against their corpses. The flames from their bodys polluted the air, but made a large wall of flame that burned for several hours. The hours were used to stall the wave of attacks and give what few hours of rest and care the soldiers could manage. My master visited the North part of the city those few hours. He did not look wary or tired. Rather, his face looked the exact same. Despite near days of sleep deprivation. His stare was as peircing as ever. He helped me make battle plans for what was left of the army. Surpisingly instead of taking what few men were left in North Freeport, he gave me extra help for wounded. The real reason I new was that with the state of our Eastern defense, any more massive waves and North Freeport would be the last refuge. The fact that all new was that the Temple of the Marr twins would not fall. This holy mission given to Avethar was probably the only thing that kept him on his feet. I remembered her words. She said that he is to be her fighter in this war to come. I new then that despite injury and tiredness, he would not fall unless slain. Tunares power was keeping him ever healed and awake. He returned a few hours ago to the gate again. But before he left we sat down for a few minutes, and each drained a keg of ale recovered from a broken home. I must say that the power of Tunare sure made him a hell of a better drinker. <br>
<br>
          Dear journal, I write now with a very heavy heart. I doubt anyone will ever read you since there is little hope in escaping this city alive now. But I will not allow this thought to hinder me. The morning that followed my master's departcher was a bright one. Many men thought that the dark powers had begun to loosen upon the city. We even spotted the number of Teir'Dal lesson in the wave of attacks against the city. From the temple I looked that human and Teir'Dal soldiers, I grinned happily as I saw the same helmets, weapons , and armor of the ones that been there the previouse night. This was not a limitless enemy. They thought to give us the illusion that their numbers went on forever. With this news the soldiers were heartened and rejoiced. However, this good fact was very short lived. I smile now at that phrase, it seems that is the only thing we ever experiance, short lived gladness. In the full heat of the noon sun, the time the Teir'Dal attacks are lessoned and weaker, I was called from my post looking to eastern Freeport to face the west. The ranger that we had kept in the desert to warn us of any attempts of attack from the east had come back. The poor boy was half dead. He stumbled into the gate, as soon as he was within safety of our walls he passed out. The scars on his body went very deep, two clerics cared for him at all times. The bruises on his body were so massive that it looked as though giant hands had bashed him many many times. I visited him that afternoon. I sat beside him in the room given only to him. He was a youth only about 16 in human years. He had braved the desert and risked his life to warn us of something that hurt him dearly. But he was not able to tell me now. My master could not be called away and what good could he do to an unconsciouse boy. I stared at this youth for a long time, then fluffed his pillow and began to leave the room. I gentle grasped the doorhandle, when my hand slid from the handle. I stopped and stood there a moment. I studdied my fingers. They seemed to gleam with a type of oil. I sniffed this oil, it gave a foul oder, one that seemed some how familiar. My mouth almost screamed for soldiers to assemble. I instead quickly left the sleeping boy's room and climbed the stairs of the great Temple of the Marr twins with such great speed that I nearly flew off the roof. From the roof I stared, the sun was still very high up and made my vision clear to all that was in the barren land. To the east I suddenly saw what the boy had barely managed to survive. Large hulking forms were quickly marching threw the geat doons of North Ro. I lunged from the rooftop onto a nearby city wall. Screaming as loud as my lungs could, &quot; TO ARMS!! ALL SOLDIERS TO THE EASTERN GATE! CASTERS PREPARE YOUR SPELLS!! I hurled threw the air onto the top of the eastern gate. The small number of soldiers I had to command quickly assembled behind me. I grabbed the nearest man to me, &quot; Go tell Lord Soulforge that an attack has begun against the east gate, I am using all the men we have left and are going to meet it head on. This will buy time for what ever counter attack he can do, or at least slow them for the wounded and civilians to escape.&quot; The human stared at me with fearful eyes, &quot; GO NOW!&quot; I yelled.  He ran with all his heart down the road. <br>
<br>
             We have marched into the Grassland of Northern Ro. There an inn and several huts have been transformed into spots where archers are posted and casters will hurl their deadly spells. Many clerics have left Freeport to join us on the field. They will assist any weakening fighter on the field. I know personally that when you have a cleric at your back in a fight. One man can take the damage of 2 and still fight on. I write this section now even as we assemble and get ready for the on coming attack. My blades have been sharpened to a razor's edge. I write now to explain what is coming. Because if we die here then no one will know how the city fell. The hours ago that I examined that substance on my hands. That substance was oil, cooking oil. Being a halfling of war and fine cooking, a little known fact to everyone but my master, I was remined strongly about it. The same oil on that boys clothing is used in cooking, the cooking however is done by ogres. They use a foul smelling and awfull oil to cook anything they can throw in their pots. The boy must of barely survived a run in with them, becuase they had indeed planned to cook him. I hear something now. The feet of our attackers. The dust has come up upon the hill. Yes there they are, more deadly than trolls in strength and stamina. The ogres are the most battle ready fighters you will ever encounter. Made by Rallos Zek, I do not know what pact the dark lords have made with him, for his childrens assistance, but I know it involves our death.  They have seen us now, a small defense. But they are not so numerouse, it seems that what ever bargain was made involved only a few of the ogres warriors. They charge now, down the great doons. I wish to write a few things before they reach us. For one I have learned what it truely meens to be a paladin in all this. To not just wield a blade and win honor threw battle. To be a paladin meens that you defend until death those that are good, you seek to stop and heal as much as you stop to fight. You follow your god and put all faith in their hands. I thank the Marr twins for showing me this. I wish to write that my master held this city against impossible odds. And that so many Tier&quot;Dal and whicked humans died these days that the powers that will hold this city will beforever reminded of the great battles that were faught here. Their blood will stain these walls forever reminding all that they came with uninmanigable power, yet we stood and preserved until the day the gates bolted and crumbled. My soldiers see this on coming evil and they are not afraid, they will fight till death and urge on the others to preserve. I am Zipparian Badgerbane, General of the North Freeport guard in the times of the great war. I swore to Tunare herself that I would protect my master and the Temple of the Marr twins. I see now what the enemy is, small hulking forms throwing themselves against a wave a rightouse furry. This city will not fall so long as I draw breath. <br>
<br>
     So writes Zipparian Badgerbane, lackey to the great paladin Avethar Soulforge, and his forever friend. I must go now, the enemy has come.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dear Journal, I am not the one who has writen in you so faithfully these many past days. I am Avethar Soulforge. I write in you now because the city of Freeport and the great Temple of the Marr twins still stands. The rechid evils that had gathered in the commons have been broken, they fled back into their dark lands. There numbers are so small now that an assualt again upon this city is impossible. We broke threw their ranks as the sun began to set. My soldiers pushed on with pashion and furry. It was only until the following morning that I returned to North Freeport to discover what had happened. The messenger Zip had sent me was caught up on the fighting and could not find me until it was too late. The wounded and civilians were all safe. The reminants of my army marched into North Ro, there we found the survivors of the attack upon Freeport's eastern gate. Only 4 were alive of the totall 20 that I left with Zip. They told me that the ogres came upon them with visciouse speed and strength. But in tern the defenders of Freeport and fighters of the great holy gods were more feirce than the ogres could ever be. Zip was at the head of the battle, his blade cleaving ogres as if they were giant blocks of air in his way. His helm shining in the setting sun, his blades a whirlwind of fury and vengance. One warrior told me that when half the ogres had been defeated our ranks finally started to fall, the clerics were so tired they fell to the earth. Zipparian still stood tall, fighting off three to four ogres to get to a fallen commrade. This one had been struck in the chest by a ogre axe. He would of certainly died had Zip not suddenly appeared. He came to this paladins rescue and with all skill, touched his chest. He then picked up his swords and covered the paladin in the bodys of several orcs. Another survivor said Zip fell then, as the ogres attacked him in full force and he was overpowered, and fell beneath their numbers. My loyal friend fell in the last moments of defense of the city, his final act of courage to save all inside. The rest of his guard faught off the ogres. I went to the place where his body was to be found. Barried beneath a hill of ogres bodys. I lifted him from their mess, he now so light in my arms. Yet still more a respected figure than any I have seen that was not a god.  I carred him to the tomb of the city. There I was about to place my greatest friend to sleep forever, when a hand touched my shoulder. A man stood next to me, fully armored with a great sword at his side. He looked battle weary, his armor blood stained and sword almost dull. He took Zip from my arms and carried him to the center of the temple of Mar, there in the sacrid water, did a girl with torn tunic and broken bow rest his body buneath the sacrid waters. His swords, now completely dull, were placed at his sides. As I stared at my friend and began to say goodbye, I touched my sword to his. The two blades Zip had carried that day were set a flame, two smaller versions of my own. The paladin Zip had saved from the ogres, was found completely healed, the fatal scar on his chest was healed over and only left a large scar. The night we repared the ship and returned to Felwithe, I shed many tears over the ocean. The survivors of my army shed them with me. They flowed into the water and helped add to its name, the isles Zip had admired seemed to cry softly. The inhabitants of them all saw our passing and pulled their children close and mourned with us.  So I left my friend there, resting within the hall he had died to protect, and amongst the people he had saved. <br>
<br>
Zipparian Badgerbane, he lived a warrior, he died a paladin. <br>
