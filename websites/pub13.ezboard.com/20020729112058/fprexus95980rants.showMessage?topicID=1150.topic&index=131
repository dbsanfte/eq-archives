Get off the topic. <br>
<br>
First of all your Quotes are NOT all from Koikeeper.  ( I hope some of the people that read this have read everything posted).  <br>
<br>
Second If your going to quote people DO IT RIGHT.   Dont mix and Match statements from others to Suit your means.<br>
<br>
Third,  You have doubled back and gone over several things more then once.  Do you think by repeating it you will get others to believe it ?? <br>
<br>
Fourth,  Your unable to be precise and logical about your rant.  Get some focus and stay on track.  This ties into the Third Points I made.   Your repeat yourself, but each time its different.  It makes one wonder how much of this is made up by you.<br>
<br>
Fifth,  I have only been in HoS for 3 months.  To state that I had something to do with the &quot;Hole&quot; Incident is unfounded.  I guess maybe I should blame the &quot;whole&quot; guild of someone that trained me, instead of the individuals.<br>
<br>
Sixth,  HoS as a whole owes you nothing.   The incident in the Hole was between you and those members of HoS that were there.<br>
<br>
Seventh,  Seems to me that the story of this Training situation was already spelled out.   YOU had your time to request apologies.  YOU didnt do so at the time.<br>
<br>
Eight,  If you had opened you eyes and paid attention.   Krynos had his epic when his corpse was dragged to you.   One of YOUR ex guild members dragged him to YOUR feet to rezz him.  Krynos WAS not a member of HoS at the time you had a bad experience.   Refusing to rezz him was no better then being one of those that YOU &quot;claim&quot; trained you in the Hole.<br>
<br>
Ninth,  If this is the type of petty attitude that you as a person has.  I feel sorry for you.  You have so much more to learn about life and relationships with others.  I hope that one day you are able to learn them.<br>
<br>
Tenth,  You statements about Our Freedoms in America and how we are &quot;obressing&quot; your rights is not properly founded.  You have the Right to state your opinion.  You have done so.  You do NOT have the right to post your opinion on a PRIVATE forum.   The HoS website is a private forum.  Unless,  YOU, Pickels, wish to pay for OUR website we are not &quot;repressing&quot;  your right to free speach.   IN America there is a difference between free Speach in public and Free Speach in private.   In public you can say what you want and no one can stop you.  IN private those that you are &quot;talking&quot; To can chose NOT to listen to you and walk away.  HoS has CHOSEN to not listen to you any more.   We have banned you from the ability to post on OUR website.<br>
<br>
Eleventh,  I hope that your petty rant is worth your reputation on Prexus.   You have now soiled it to a point where its most likely unreapairable.   I dont know how many people read P.Com from our server,  but if enough do,  you have just made your life that much harder.   All this done cause of a year old grievance against HoS as a &quot;whole&quot;  instead of the indiviuals that were involved.<br>
<br>
Pickels,  Log off,  Walk away from the keyboard.   Go outside and smell the wonderful Air of your country.   Look at the people around you.   Is your grievance against HoS larger then the things you see ?   Can you forget about Everquest and HoS long enough to see the REAL beauty that surrounds you ?   I lived in Portugal for 2 years.  I speak fluent Portuguese.   I so seriously miss the European atmosphere.  Its like america yet so different.   Maybe a vacation for you away from your home town would be good.   What ever it takes to get you to open your eyes to the real world,  DO IT !  This is a game and ONLY a game.   Things happen that you cant control.  People will do things that piss you off.   What make it a game is that you can walk away from it IF you choose to.   If you choose to not walk away from it,  EQ can take over your life.  IT can become your life and this is a sad situation.<br>
<br>
/bye Pickels.<br>

Let's name off a few of the reasons why.<br>
<br>
1) you try to make HoS sound like a bunch of dicks, don't think I need to touch on this.<br>
2) your sig is long and annoying.  You really think we want to know about you and all your twinks and what languages they know? STFU.<br>
3) you feel you should double post your incredibly stupid sig.<br>
4) you're pissed about an event that happened one year ago.<br>
5) you spout off gibberish, nobody knows why.<br>
6) I knew you were familiar, you were the enchanter who gated when your necro group in seb was in trouble one day.  You felt you were too important to die an XP death, so you let group die and gated/disbanded.  Idiot. <p><center>

<br>
There were no trains on our part!  We were prepping for a raid.  Your guildmate wanted to join us.  We said no.  He proceeded to drag mobs into the middle of us prepping.  He also berated us in /ooc and /shout.  We got tired and moved through and left you and your group at the top of the Hole.  <br>
<br>
That's it!  That's all that happened!<br>
<br>
And stop taking my quotes out of context!<br>
<br>
Along with a bunch of other &quot;reasons&quot; why HoS was the ENEMY of your guild (some of which included &quot;Reply to a Guild Leader of Hated Ones in an unproper way by saying &quot;Huh?&quot; if a Crime.&quot; and &quot;Thinking Harmony is an answer to everything is a Crime. I Hate you!&quot; and &quot;Posting loving things on a Hated Ones webboard is a Crime.&quot;) you said &quot;Unannounced Trianing of Elementals above lvl40 is a Crime.&quot;  Hence, my JOKING response of what about mobs BELOW level 40.<br>
<br>
Notice the &quot;Huh?&quot;.  I believe that we were accused of training and our response was &quot;Huh?&quot;.  Apparantly, that's a crime against the Hated Ones.  And..we're hated.  Huh?<br>
<br>
I still think you're taking this roleplaying thing too far.  And I don't like it when mean people hide behind &quot;roleplaying.&quot; <p><img src=http://magellan.dcc.uaf.edu/chris/pics/el1.jpg><br>

Since I personally know the person playing Pickels, and I also know what happened there (died a few times on that day at the zone) I must say I still wonder why there wasn't a simple apology from a HoS guild representative.<br>
<br>
But since there never was one, Pickels decided to never lend a helping hand (including rezzes) to members of Harmony of Souls unless it was clearly her mistake and something she could correct. And this she has lived by ever since.<br>
<br>
After the merger, those members of the Hated Ones that joined, decided to leave behind their old grudges and follow the rules, guidelines and vision of the new guild and their leaders. Pickels decided to stick to this one thing, and when it clashed with guild policy, she decided to leave the guild.<br>
<br>
The only reason it came out in the open again was to make clear that this is a personal viewpoint and not guildrelated whatsoever. <br>
<br>
Because there are allot of members In HoS that never even heard of this, or remember it, Pickels decided to clarify a few things and posted on the HoS forum. Although I do not agree with the way she posted it (a poll) The responses resulted in an aggravation that got her banned from that board. To reach more HoS members, she also posted this on the Prexus forum. <br>
<br>
Here the whole discussion resulted in name calling, a reference to nazis' (forgot the link concerning these type references) and a personal attack on linguistic skills (Like Pickels, I am also a native Dutch speaker) <br>
<br>
In the mean time, all Pickels is still asking for, is for a representative to simply come out and say &quot;We are sorry for all the inconvenience we caused during the episode in the Hole. We apologize for not calling our trains or our pulls that caused so much trouble. And we hope that in the future we can get along better.&quot; Or wordings in some similar matter. <br>
<br>
This could have been taken care of when this problem was debated a year ago. This could have been taken care of also when this problem was debated again half a year ago. And this could have been taken care of before this flame war started again. <br>
<br>
For all those readers that really do not know what this is all about, reading the posts really does not help allot anymore to know what has happened. Like all old fights, it is no longer about what really happened, but about what happened afterwards. All those people that have or had a long term relationship know what I mean by that. <br>
<br>
At this moment it resulted in a hurt toward a member of HoS and the following discussions. During the last year, it never was an issue because Pickels avoided HoS. Pickels, Antixa and all her other characters are experienced players that have a good reputation throughout the community. Those that ever grouped with them know that. <br>
<br>
HoS is a guild with a good reputation also, with friendly people allot of good players. The fact that an formal apology was never given is the only reason this still goes on.<br>
<br>
To Pickels I have the following words: <br>
<br>
Blijf geloven in jezelf, trek je niets aan van de mening van buitenstaanders, maar wees wel zo verstandig om ook de fouten die wij gemaakt hebben te erkennen.<br>

<br>
We made the attempt to rectify the situation back in November.  One of our Guild Leaders (Boney) posted on their board to ask why we were Hated!! because of an issue that arose in game when Prickles was rude to one of our members and said it was because we were &quot;Hated&quot;<br>
Like civilized adults our guild attempted to rectify it.. first we had to ask what we did wrong... that post is below.<br>
<br>
what we got in resonse was (quote again from their Board)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> People that publicly offend Hated Ones are enemies. <br>
<br>
Training accident in the Hole with unannounced trains and<br>
not paying donations for rezzes that happend twice with people wearing &lt;Harmony of Souls&gt; tag.<br>
<br>
These are 10 things why HoS is enemy:<br>
<br>
1) Offending a Guildleader of Hated Ones is a Crime. <br>
2) Offending a Guildleader of a Dark Race Guild is a Crime.<br>
3) Offending a Group a Hated Ones is a Crime.<br>
4) Unannounced Trianing of Elementals above lvl40 is a Crime.<br>
5) Not paying donation for 700mana cost Ressurection is a Crime.<br>
6) Reply to a Guild Leader of Hated Ones in an unproper way by saying &quot;Huh?&quot; if a Crime.<br>
7) Thinking you can train mobs and saying nothing is a Crime.<br>
 Thinking someone of Hated Ones should live by the HoS rules &quot;Shoot and Forget&quot; is a Crime.<br>
9) Thinking Harmony is an answer to everything is a Crime. I Hate you!<br>
10) Posting loving things on a Hated Ones webboard is a Crime.<br>
<br>

So that are only 10 things why HoS is our enemy. Let me sleep over it and I will come up with a couple more. <br>

So we did not apologize..  the little phreak didn't ask for an apology he just resorted to his top 10 list, the only thing he left us with was that he was gonna sleep on it and get back to us on more reasons why we are hated..<br>

  HoS Enemies?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 I saw that Harmony of Souls is listed as an enemy? I can't recall any type of encounter with Hated Ones that would lead you to think of us as an enemy?<br>
<br>
Please elaborate.<br>

 HEHE i was wondering the same thing. Greetings folks. Just wanna say that i am in no way bound by guild tags when it comes to associations. So, if i run into one of ya, expect a hello or a wave and not some weird reaction to a guild tag. <br>
<br>
Btw, /wave Camden. Heya. Long time no see! Its been a long time since my days in CT when i ran into ya but just wanted to say hey.<br>
<br>
(if Camden is like MIA or never reads boards, one of ya tell him i said hey will ya?) <br>

   Re: HoS Enemies?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 That is indeed sad news about Camden. Our best to you in your loss &amp; deepest sympathies to his family and friends. <br>
<br>
I too would be interested in the extent of dis-satisfaction with HoS as recently one of our Souls was denied a Rez by a cleric, named Anitixa &amp; associated with your fine EQ family. Should one of ours ever do or have done anything unreasonable to upset or hinder the in game enjoyment of any player and our leaders get wind of it then our entire membership would tend to take a special interest in the interaction as we pride ourselves on our ability to treat others with whom we encounter with the utmost of in game respect and dignity. <br>
<br>
Naturally, since we happen to have quite a few lvl 49+ clerics at our disposal the person was not in-convienienced for long and to my knowledge ultimatly got their rez from a guild source. The in game gesture/overture of your guilds cleric &amp; words were, however, posted on our message boards and &lt;smiles&gt; indeed raised an eyebrow or two as this --- being listed as an enemy? --- is a guild first for us since HoS has always been percieved as a Harmonious, easy going, generous &amp; friendly group of folks. Indeed we do tend to pride ourselves on all aspects of our in game behavior.<br>
<br>
Understand that I am just a troop &amp; not a guild officer &amp; therefore cannot speak for anyone other than my Druid &amp; Cleric. I would acknowledge that I must now assume that there there is a desire or preference, if you would, on your part, to have my in game service providers ie clerics, druids etc not bother your membership when asked, by them to Rez- transport or in any other way assist you fine folks. <br>
<br>
For our own information would you please consider posting here or on our message boards the nature of your percieved grievance with HoS or any of it's members. I then will be happy (should you prefer to post here) to make a notation on our message boards of; 1) your preference to be left alone and 2) The nature of your grievance. The only thing that we could figure out was a few times once in the Hole &amp; once in Chardock where we were asked by one of your fine associates to join in two separate &amp; high level epic battlements &amp; since all the groups were full that individual was was advised that it wasn't possible becauswe we had no others to group that individual with. Howwever, I am certain that this is/was not enough of a grievance to warrant an acknowledgement of an entire guild as ---- uh enemies? <br>
<br>
While we all recognize the importance of cordial in game relations &amp; the importance of having as many friends within the lands of Norrath as possible we also recognize that despite our best efforts to respect all with whom we interact it is not always possible to make all people happy all the time. <br>
<br>
Regardless of your response we would always wish you and your EQ family the best of in game experiences.<br>

 Camden has been online 2 times after the accident Bran so dont worry about him he was held in hospital for 5 days from what I heard but still he was unharmed. Atleast fisical speaking that is. <br>
<br>
However Ghulard hasnt been on since the 11th of September and I really think he might be missing.<br>
<br>
For everyone to know when I update the member roster it has updated dates on it so you can see if yours or others has been updated lately. If not and you are playing on a diffrent time than I do please mail me with updated information.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Pickles, you are looking for something you will never get, because NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. I was not in HoS at the time, but from what I know of my guildmates, they are upstanding people.

<br>
I gotta say, for a person who simple wanted an apology from HoS you really went about it wrong.  While I wasn't a guild member at the time of this incident and I really don't think you were trained I would like to offer some advice.  In the future if you feel you were wronged talk to an officer in whatever guild you feel crossed you.  In the future, you should not try to get an apology, even if you feel it is deserved, by making a post on a guild board demanding an apology and insulting the members of that guild.  It might also help if you didn't go around posting a list of &quot;Hated Guilds.&quot;  I really don't think this could have been handled any worse than how you handled it Pickels.  You also really need to sit down and breathe before you post.  I know about 3/4 of your posts I couldn't make heads or tails of becuase... well you simply didn't make sense.  It seemed as though you were just tossing words and accussations together in a way to try and p1ss off both members of HoS and our friends.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, do us all a favor and pull your head out of you a$$.  Whatever you think happened it happened a year ago.  Do you realize if I held a grudge against every person who ever trained, ks'd, or insulted me on this server there'd be about 6 people I could group with, 4 of which being characters on my brother's account.   <p><center><img src="http://spin.emich.edu/sig/falk2.gif" border="0">

This &quot;person&quot; gets supposedly trained in November.<br>

Goes and complains about it on their message board.<br>
<br>
Now 6 months later, they're here on the rant board complaining about the same thing again. They're right, everyone else is wrong.<br>

Sounds like a couple other people we have here.

If you had actually read, and more importantly understood any of my posts on the OFO board you would know the following. I completed my Epic that evening, because I have good friends. Also that the reason I was in KK was to retrieve a fishbone earing I had on my ranger on the ledge, who had been there specifically to track for Phinny. The same ranger who was logged in and looking at the raid force on the ledge you were with when you would not res my corpse, though that would have escaped your notice too no doubt.<br>

<br>
30 people of HoS already inside why should they run for 7 elementals right?<br>
<br>
because the train was more like:<br>
2 Golems and 5 elementals.<br>
<br>
And infact when they came and started wacking the entrance Elemantals that we try to split. Ignoring the fact that we where already there.<br>
<br>
If it wasnt anything big I would have long forgotten it.<br>
<br>
But the train was comming from deep plus averyone knowing the Hole would understand that zoning will not garantee you from surviving it because the zone point is underwater and your trapped behind a locked door.<br>
<br>
Things that violated the play nice policy:<br>
- Taking someones Spawn<br>
- Simultanius Training without warning.<br>
- Calling people names (Orchidius got really offended that day for refusing to summon them after they all died when they got whiped down below in the hole)<br>
<br>
Everyone not knowing what happened shouldnt have replied to this includig their Guildleader. Now it only got worse. Not many people understand I can still be angry after 1 year.<br>
But 1 year is long enough for some one to come to reason and apologize to me. This never happened.<br>
<br>
The fact they didnt know about this issue is a lie too. How can they recall it all in a sudden and remember it wasnt anything big?<br>
<br>
The fact remains they got upset after I refused to rez one of their wizards.<br>
<br>
Yes those things happen when HoS ruined their reputation. For wearing their tag can be difficult when you come accross someone that isnt forgiving as others and backstabs into their pride.<br>
<br>
A simple sorry would have been enough but for this personal humiliation I will ate my stakes higher.<br>
<br>
1 stack of Blue diamonds and their guildleader on their knees for me.<br>
And who knows I can forgive the whole thing.<br>

<br>
Pickels, don't hold your breath.<br>
<br>
Never in my life have I ever seen a more foolish, puerile, illogical, oversensitive, uptight, or arrogant display on a message board than this...whatever it is you've posted. Truly, the resentment you feel towards HoS must be your way of channeling the aggression caused by having a 20-foot telephone pole wedged firmly up your arse. I cannot believe any normal human being would want to be within 100 feet of you if your real life behavior is anything like your antics in this thread. <br>
<br>
Nor can I conceive the idea that you're posting these words in earnest. I've said some stupid @#%$ in the past, but buffoons like you make me look halfway smart.<br>
<br>
Christa. Thanks for the laugh. =) <p><html><body>
