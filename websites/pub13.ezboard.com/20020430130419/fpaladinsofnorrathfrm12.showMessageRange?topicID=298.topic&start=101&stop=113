I don't play this game to be the best damage dealer, best tank, whatever. If I wanted that I'd have been a warrior.<br>
<br>
When I started this game I hadn't the slightest clue about what a Paladin was. All I knew was that I could help others without KSing them the way my mage did. <br>
<br>
I've learned a little bit along the way of playing 56 levels and two years, most of that without EVER having enough cash to dream of having an FBSS, much less actually buying one. I wasn't hasted until around lvl 50 anyways, so it never struck me as all important. I went that long without, I didn't see the need to bother myself with it until it came available.  <p><CENTER><FONT COLOR=#000080><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125072">~Qaldaena Starrdancer~</A></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=2E8B57>Knight of Tunare</FONT><BR>

AC is king, yes this is true...but AC is no good if your rogue/cleric/bard/wizzie/druid/shammy/chanter/mage/ranger is the one being hit.  If you are loosing taunt, and wasting mana on stuns to hold it, then you need a haste item.  Like everything in EQ it is a balancing act. <p>Lawson Faithfulblade <BR>

But you will do significantly better with haste.<br>
It's very obvious to me that there's the people who understand the mathematics behind this and realize what is up.<br>
There's the second croud of RPer, touchy feely, I like my visible numbers folks who can't be reasoned with by logic or facts.<br>
<br>
All of the pro haste arguments are based on hard facts, numbers, parsed logs and experiences from top end players who know what they are talking about. All of the no haste arguments are based on made up numbers, second hand information and personal experiences from more casual players.<br>
I'm generalizing here but anyway.....<br>
<br>
There's no right and wrong way to play the game. True. It is my opinion that haste is more important. It is your opinion that ac is more important. That's fine.<br>
The point is, that regardless of who has what opinion, the best option in almost all circumstances is going to be haste, not ac. So you may be of the opinion that ac is more important, but your opinion is incorrect. Because it is based on subjective experiences as opposed to hard data.<br>
<br>
Don't tell me a story about how you threw on this 20 ac belt and were able to solo mobs 5 levels higher than when you had an FBSS. It's wishy washy, show me some logs. Show me some data. I know you can't.<br>
<br>
Falreth, your numbers are pulled out of a magic hat. Please show me any proof. They are way off from anything.<br>
<br>
So please everyone, continue doing what you are doing. If you can't be swayed by the overwhelming evidence in favour of haste then you are obviously not going to budge from me trying to badger you about your gear choices. I like to be efficient. I guess some people don't. <br>

Your posts unfortunately leave you very open to attack. You like to spew your thoughts out like you are chatting in eq. You've got the time to edit your comments. Try to do it a bit and you won't get picked apart so much.<br>

<br>
my words always come out wrong, i say things spur of the moment that i shouldn't have said. i don't come here to make enemies. but i don't like being attacked because i choose to play a certain way that you guys may not agree with. you can parse to the nano second, and you may be 100% right, but that does not mean i have to play the way you guys want me to play. i may be wrong, i may be selling myself short, but it is not YOUR place to tell me i don't know anything because i choose to play a certain way. <br>
<br>
i am not a power gamer, i don't play purely for exp to get the fastest kill the most efficient way. i am not in an uber guild that has access to all kinds of nice gear, nor do i have alot of plat to be tossing around. i work with what i got. to ME, a belt of defense is better than a fbss, it may not be to you guys, but your not the one controlling my character. i'm still saving up to get CC gaunts like i said earlier, i'll get them, use them, and see if i like them. may turn out i like the stats on my current gaunts more, but me using no haste doesn't affect any of you.<br>
<br>
i apologize for being short tempered<br>

You may not care if you don't gain experience as fast as other Paladins, but you also are slowing down the experience of the group you are in, especially if  you are one or the only primary source of melee damage.  I don't mind people enjoying the game in different forms, but it is a little frustrating for me to work my butt off to try to gain experience for myself and my group while having a member contributing much less than he could be because he refuses to listen to good advice.  (This applies not only to Haste, but to Paladins using terrible ratio 1H weapons when they could easily use a decent/good 2H but are too vain/stubborn to lose their shield or the stats it provides, or to Rangers or other non tanks refusing to back off a bit in the cases you can't get the aggro and forcing the Cleric to waste valuable mana on healing them much less efficiently than they could the main tank.)<br>
<br>
My usual group consists of a Bard (my RL brother) a Cleric (my wife) and sometimes an SK and Necro.  Losing the haste from even an FBSS casues me to use more mana to out taunt the Bard, (and I find I never have enough mana to spare anyway) and also allows the mob to live longer, wasting my Cleric's mana.<br>
<br>
Most of the Paladins here aren't wanting you to conform to some cookie cutter form of what they consider uber, at least not for the reason that everyone else is doing it.  They advocate Haste above all else (within reason) because it has been tested and proved to be the most significant upgrade you can give your character.  You're not only hurting your self if you don't use Haste when you have the opportunity, your hurting every group and raid you are involved in.
