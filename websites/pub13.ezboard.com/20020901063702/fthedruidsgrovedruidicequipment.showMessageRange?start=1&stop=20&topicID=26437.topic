Every once in a while whenever i get inspected by mostly druids, but other classes as well, say something along the lines of &quot;A druid wearing a Fungi?  lol, now i've seen everything&quot;.  I got this three times yesterday in 2 different places, i was like wtf?  To be fair, the reason why i got so many comments yesterday was because i had recently won an RBG in an exp group, and have since been wearing that in place of my Dreamworvine Garland.  But there were MANY instances before where people thought i was clueless for wearing a Fungi as a Druid, even guildmates have commented why i as a Druid wear a fungi.  The comment i get by most Druids is &quot;A fungi is only worth it if you have a manastone&quot;.<br><br>One of those people yesterday started to condescend me explaining to me how i should be wearing wisdom+ items, NOT a fungi and RBG :P  He was con'ing blue to me, had no idea what lvl he was.  He started getting into asking me if i i'm some kind of 'battle druid', and saying how druids arent supposed to melee, blah, blah, blah.  I was in a OS group at the time, and we were at drop-in headed to a camp.  What i basically said to him was &quot;wisdom doesnt mean anything here unless your starting from FM the whole time, plus i enjoy melee'ing at times&quot;.  His reply was &quot;Druids dont melee&quot;.  I said &quot;Druids can if they nuke in melee range, but it really depends on the Druid&quot;.  Then there was a move call, and that was that.  He was just so sure of himself that he was so right, and that i had no clue, it was annoying i didnt have more time to argue with him.<br><br>Now, I have better stat-wise alternatives to my fungi like Elysian or even Efreeti, but almost never swap it out.  Why?  Because like i said, wisdom doesnt mean anything TO ME in most places despite the fact that every Druid seems to believe wisdom means everything.  My max wisdom is about 207, altho i'm running around in most places with less than 200.  When soloing i'll be around the 207 mark, and thats basically the only time i wish i had higher(but almost never solo these days).  I'll usually put resist gear on for big boss fights but if resists arent too important i'll try and focus on wisdom.  I very rarely swap my Fungi out for anything, even when quading, or even when i was Upheaval AE'ing, was still wearing my Fungi, and neglected the extra 15 or so wisdom the Elysian would give me.  <br><br>Why do i do this you ask?  Because the hp regen a Druid can maintain with a Fungi on, with regrowth is better than any 15 wisdom i get in mana or resists.  This is my personal opinion, but i see no argument saying its wrong for just about any scenario.  No other class can self-maintain this regen rate like we can, especially if you throw Natures Recovery into the mix.  Cant tell you how handy it is for AE fights like TOV.  Having this on with regrowth, and NR i dont even worry about the AE damage, altho i rarely cast the NR on myself in those situations since i'll usually put it on a melee.  In quading situations, i'll admit it might be better to go with +wisdom, but its not like i cant do a quad with my mana bar where its currently at, plus i usually have KEI.  Theres no difference in downtime from somebody that has twice my wisdom, their still going to have to sit to regen that other half of wisdom back.  So while they may be able to do 2 quads, they'll have to med twice as long.  Granted, they can maybe quad Gorangas at 250 wis or whatever, when i probably couldnt at 200.  Big deal.<br><br>If anybody has messed with Upheaval kiting, you get hit alot, well i did at least, granted its only like 4 mobs out of the 20.  I was kinda at a dilemma when i was doing this, since i never had enough mana to finiish them off, and always had to med kite.  There were times where i could med kite and finish them off within the 10min ensnare time, but more often than not, i'd have to resnare them.  So i'll say for AE Upheaval kiting it pays to have the wisdom only because of the 10 minute ensnare time limit, then again its easily arguable that the extra hp regens help in regards to the hits you take and you take plenty doing this.<br><br>The biggest drawback that i see is that less wisdom means you fizzle more.  I do notice a slight difference, but to me its not so big of a deal where i'd give up a constant 15-20pt hp regen rate, for a few less fizzles and maybe one extra spell cast going from FM to oom.  So for one big boss mob fight that doesnt AE in some way, it probably pays to go wisdom as well.  I will say that i'll take the extra constant regen over an extra 10 in a resistance(all in the mind), or the 15 wisdom i can gain with a swap(barely noticeable in the mana bar) in just about any scenario.<br><br>My point is a Fungi Tunic complements a Druid VERY well.  This idea behind Druids thinking wisdom is the most important thing we should be persuing is naive.  Its just a general misconception that people think wisdom&gt;everything else for just about every situation.  Now i can understand other classes thinking we're crazy because they dont know any better.  But to get this crap from other Druids is just rediculous, especially when they presume to know what their talking about.  I've never bothered responding to the comments until yesterday, but this guy was acting like such a know-it-all when he was just naive.<br><br>Feel free to debate this.  Personally, i think wisdom is another misconception about our class.  I'll tell you one thing, its going to take a BP like the Burrower one with FT5? or something like that Starfire one from Vex Thall to replace my fungi, thats how much i value it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uligge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ligge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Venerable Hierophant<br><center>of The Grove</center></span><br>  Posts: 1847<br> <font color=#333399>(7/19/02 12:05:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26437.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqguide.com/changingtide/images/ligsmall.jpg width=100 height=129></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do people think a Druid shouldnt wear a Fungi?</span><hr size=1> I wear mine only when necessary - AEs, pulling, quadding and I happened to get beat a bit so I swap it on, etc - I just dont like the look.

Don't think I've ever heard that one. I don't think that's the case Broom.<br><br>As far as RBG and Fungi...well I can understand the RBG. It does have pretty nice stats as far as sta and hp's go...I regret selling mine off my monk actually. Now that I have her better haste in the back slot I miss the stats and weight of the rbg. But I still wouldn't wear it on my druid (the belt she has now is pretty nice imo). But, a fungi I just don't see a use for. It depends on your playing style but I've never been one to need to regen that badly, or more than what my bp gives me. I personally think the fungi has crappy stats and it looks bad too, but you can't beat the regen for a melee and especially for a puller.<br><br>I also feel there is a big diff btwn having 207 wis (or lower) and having 255 especially when buffing and trying to squeeze out another heal.<br><br>It's all a play style though..I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.

But then I started tradeskills/shawls and needed the cash to raise them and buy components for quests, heh.   A druid BP that just has wisdom is pretty pointless, it needs to have alot of mana to warrant wearing it over a fungi.  Well at least the kael/skyshrine BPs have a good amount of mana and the convenience of right click regrowth of the grove.   Anyway, both types of BP have their place, but I see a fungi as a more situation type of BP - for soloing in spots where you might get hit often and raids with PBAOE.<br><br>BTW, that VT BP with starfire isnt so hot - it has a 10 second cast time for a 600 pt nuke ;p.   Its not even as impressive as the wizard Rend robe that has a similar cast time for 780 damage and is FAR easier to get from VP.

If you are in VT, you are probably maxed out in FT anyway and better off medding with C3 + FT15, heh.&quot;<br><br>Well, if you have C3 + FT15 (plus whatever else), you gain the benefit from them whether you are sitting or standing.  The ONLY difference is the mana you lose from not medding.  For a druid with maxxed med skill (252), the difference is 20 mana/tick.<br><br>The cast from the VT tunic is 10 seconds, so you're going to lose 2 ticks of medding, or 40 mana.  The VT tunic does 612 damage (ignoring focus/AA crits, since we'll ignore crits for the comparison also, and ignoring resists for now).  So we are doing 612 damage by forgoing 40 mana, which works out to 15.3 damage/mana!<br><br>Now let's assume a druid who has the VT tunic has SCM3, and an MP3 item, and specs in Evocation.  The top druid nuke is Moonfire, which does 1150 damage for 320 mana, base.  The mana savings are 11% + 10% + 5.5% = 26.5%, so Moonfire actually costs 236 mana.  1150/236 = 4.87 dmg/mana.<br><br>So from a dmg/mana perspective, the VT tunic is over 3 times more efficient than Moonfire, while Moonfire still wins in the dmg/sec department.  If it's got to die NOW, use Moonfire, if it's gonna be a long fight, or you're pacing yourself through many mobs, use the tunic unless you're FM.<br><br>LOL, I have neither Moonfire nor the robe =)<br><br>Tat <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=238695">Tatanka</a> WolfDancer, 60th Druid<BR>Snookims Whinzlow, 50th Enchanter<BR>Silvara Drakonsbane, 48th Druid<BR>Bigith Dwigus, 48th Warrior<BR>Logic of War, 7th Hammer</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urandomuser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>random user</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid of The Grove</span><br>  Posts: 606<br> <font color=#333399>(7/19/02 5:43:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26437.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do people think a Druid shouldnt wear a Fungi?</span><hr size=1> I have a fungi which I wear full time.  I also have an elysian tunic (bagged for when resists are key and I don't think I'll need the regen... ie when I'm with a cleric who is going to group heal or against fear etc) and a woven grass tunic (bagged for RotG).  I do also have a manastone, but it's not that often that I'm in the old world (though it makes killing greenies a TON easier... between manastone and RotG that's an additional 10 mana/tick).  I also have 253 wisdom with the fungi on (no kei) and I could have over 255 but have chosen other items.<br><br>I am often puller, I sometimes quadkite, and sometimes do some risky things.  In these situations the fungi is invaluable.  I played without the fungi for a little while, and I have realized that I can't go back.  True if I got a burrower tunic, I'd probably change my mind, but I've ingrained the built-in regen into my play-style, and I would have to change a lot if I were to not have my tunic.  It's a great feeling to be killing two velium hounds, get two more hound adds before you get everything snared and rooted, be down to 1 or 2 bubbles of health and know you don't need to heal yourself (assuming you are smart and have 3rd person view to make sure you don't get more adds).<br><br>As to melee though... I'm a big non-fan of melee any time where you can med.  I did a little parsing (granted it was only 1 log over 7 or so minutes... otoh I really doubt you're going to find much variation) with an rbb (31% haste), VoG (60% haste), a ton of attack buffs (I had over 1000 attack) and with my epic, and ended up doing 11.3 dps to a mob.  Your average druid is not going to have that high of a haste item, and often will not have a haste spell cast on them.

Wis (or Int for Int casters) is just one of the factors that determine fizzle rates.<br><br>I think it is still the case.  Just a few months ago, while several of us here were testing the fizzle rates of "broken" spells, we noted a difference in the fizzle rates of spells when other variables were constant.  My fizzle rate with a broken spell like BoR, for example, was several points lower than someone of the same level and with the same max Evoc specialization.  The difference was that I was at 255+ wisdom, and they were are 200-210 (I forget the precise number).  <br><br>Of course, the additional wisdom only matters for the broken spells and for spells within a level or two of when you get them.  All other spells should be at the lowest base fizzle rate after a few levels, so wisdom/specialization/etc. should have no effect. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugimlifan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gimli fan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#333399>(7/25/02 1:56:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26437.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> sounds good</span><hr size=1> If you dig it, it sounds good to me.<br><br>Why worry if people who are running up and inspecting you give you grief.
