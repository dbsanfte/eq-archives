He slouched over his food as though guarding it from a predator.  Each day that passed since Esmira left him, Taman sank deeper and deeper into sulking.  The demon he wouldn't admit to gnawed at him as he sank, a pirranha stripping the meat off a sinking skeleton.  When at last he reached bottom, Taman found his resolve.  <br>
<br>
Taman quietly washed out his bowl and brushed the crumbs from the table.  He grabbed a light jacket from the hook as he headed out into the chill evening air.  He could smell the smoke from chimneys along the lane as he strode purposefully toward the Temple of Light.  He had been patient.  He had waited.  But that time was over.  Now was a time for action.  He was enveloped in a strong feeling of peace, the calmness of a ship laying sail with its back to the wind plowing a straight course in a calm sea.<br>
<br>
Reaching the Temple Taman went directly to the rectory.  &quot;I wish to speak with Grandfather Tobias&quot; he told the servant who opened the door.  He was allowed into the entry hall where he waited, standing like a tree firmly planted and unaffected by gales.  Tobias came out of the study and greeting Taman with a warm and welcome smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;Taman, it is good t' see you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I've come fer me wife.&quot;  Taman said bluntly.<br>
<br>
Tobias nodded and quietly walked up the stairs to the living quarters. Taman waited.  The sound of a woman's voices echo'd down the stairwell.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't be seein' im.&quot; It was Esmira's voice.  &quot;I wish to dedicate m'self to the church.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grandfather Tobias spoke with a quiet authority.  &quot;Ye have not been called, Esmira, and your days of sanctuary are ended.   Ye may follow yer duty or ye may starve in the streets.  It makes no nevermind t' me.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Taman looked up and saw Esmira being forcefully escorted down the stairs by Grandfather Tobias.  When she reached the entry hall she jerked her arm hard out of his grip and headed directly for the street, without so much as looking at Taman.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Thank ye, Tobias&quot; Taman said and followed his wife.<br>
<br>
Esmira whirled in a fury down the street, a tempest blowing up bits of dust and litter in her wake.  She gritted her teeth. Fury raged in her eyes.  As she came to the lane to her home, she didn't stop.  She didn't turn.  She continued forward toward the gates of the city.  Taman followed.  <br>
<br>
As she approached the gates of the city a guard stepped out and caught her arm.  &quot;Woah, woah young filly.  And where ye be goin' with such a foul face as yer wearin'.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmira tried to free herself but the guard held her firmly.  &quot;It be none a yer business.  Let me go.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard looked up at Taman.  &quot;This one yers?&quot;  he asked.  Taman nodded.  &quot;A wild one she is.&quot;  the guard smiled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, there can be no arguin' with ye there.&quot; Taman answered.  <br>
<br>
Esmira struggled against the guards grip and finally exploded in a burst of arms and legs flailing and kicking.  Her teeth found the guard's forearm as her boot found his shin. Taman stepped in, grabbed Esmira by the waist and threw her over his shoulder like a sack of grain.  &quot;That's enough, Es.  Time t' come home now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmira screamed and beat on Taman's back, kicking her feet but no more able to free herself than a horse from its harness or an ox from the plow.  The guard straightened his sleeves, no concern over whatever slight bruise might be left behind.  As Taman carried Esmira back into town the guard called out, &quot;Good luck to ya', man&quot; and resumed his duties.<br>
<br>
Esmira stopped fighting as Taman turned down the lane to his home.  He carried her inside, and used his free arm to slide the heavy beam in place, locking the door.  He set Esmira down and she bolted for the bedroom.  She lept onto the dressing table, opened the window and pulled herself up, sticking her head through..  &quot;Ye'll never fit through that, Essie,&quot; Taman laughed.  He folded his arms across his chest and watched as she  struggled to escape.  Her hips filled the opening and stalled her progress.  <br>
<br>
Esmira went limp in the window, defeated.  She ripped the sod she had clawed into trying to free herself, threw it at the alleyway and burst into tears.  Taman waited.  Finally Esmira eased herself out of the window opening, painfully scraping her stomach against its ledge.  Taman lifted her from the dressing table to the floor and held her, arms to her side.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate you, Taman Talisman.  Til the day I day I hate you.&quot;  Esmira spat, tears flowing down her cheeks.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry ye feel that way, Essie.  But it don't change a thing.&quot;  Taman looked into her face, still a child's face so much like Caedusia's.  Esmira turned away from his gaze.<br>
&quot;Ye're womb be whole now an' those hips a yers be good for birthin'.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Taman wrestled Esmira onto the bed and lifted her skirt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uwarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lost One </span><br>  Posts: 323<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(10/3/00 6:40:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=154.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: You're Me Wife, Dammit!</span><hr size=1> And rape is still rape.  <br>

Think you should make a runner up story where esmira takes a knife and shoves it through Taman's head than leaves the city in the night with her child... or something to that extent.<br>
