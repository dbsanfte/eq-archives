And it's been stupid reasons mostly that I've died.  Last night was a kicker.  <BR>  <BR> 1) First I popped over to Permafrost and checked the preacher room.  Nobody was camping it!  No groups around and I had read somewhere that a level 24 druid had broken the spawn there, I'm 26 so no problem...hmmm first up, an evoker.  Might be a problem but if I nuke him, I should be okay.  Kabooom!!! Health dropping fast...no way I can finish him off before I die, gate...interupt, gate, interupt, gate, regain concentration, YES!!!!  A bubble left of life and I made it!  Then when it's done loading I'm at my bind spot naked...WTF!!! I never got a &quot;you are dead&quot; message <BR>  <BR> 2) Okay, so I can't do that solo.  So I go to Sol A.  Start fighting in the rug room.  Doing great when some high level guy runs by trailing oh, 20 gobs or so....I only say him run by, didn't see the gobs until my health started dropping FAST!!  Run to zone, zoned with one bubble left.  Appear on the other side in time to see someone get killed by a greater kobold...step back into the zone, end up at my bind point...WTF!!!!  I looked back, no &quot;kobold hits you for XX&quot;, no &quot;You have been slain&quot;, nothing. <BR>  <BR> 3) With a group of 3 fighting 3 particularly tough gobs.  The gobs are getting ready to drop but we're hurt bad.  I back up and start healing up everyone.  (I'm at a bubble and a half, bard is at 1/2 bubble, wiz at 2 bubbles)  I heal both them up to 3 bubbles, then switch to myself, but they decide that it must be time to zone and back up towards me, of course the gobs aggroed on me, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.... <BR>  <BR> 4) Exploring with 3 others including a 30th cleric. we decided to look for the bar room.  Well, we aggroed about 5 gobs on us.  We were doing okay, cleric was healing, we where fighting....messages scrolling really fast.  Well, our cleric cried &quot;RUN&quot; and I missed it.  Finished the one I was fighting, turned around, saw about 10 gobs, no group.  &quot;Uhh, guys?&quot;  LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.... <BR>  <BR> 5) I went and checked out the foreman room, of course it was camped, started heading back to the wiz I was with and the predator spawned on my head.  We killed it and I got the kobold boots.  Awesome!  Then some guy messaged me saying that he had been camping it for a long time today.  He acted nice and I did see him sitting in the general area so I decided to be nice and give him the boots.  You know how they say good acts are rewarded with good karma?  Bullcrap.  A gob wizard spawned behind me on the way back, cried out &quot;Foolish Druid, you didn't think you'd end the night on a positive note, did you?&quot; and blasted me.  I didn't even know he was there, I just saw &quot;You have been force shocked!&quot;  Camo dropped and every goblin aggroed on me.  Whack, whack, 160 backstab, forceshock, whack, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. <BR>  <BR> I'm just so ticked, I'd be level 27 and some if stupid things didn't occur(1 and 2 tick me off the most).  I feel like telling any group I'm in, the second I hit 2 bubbles, I'm running.  But I'm just not like that.  I tend to look at others benefit first and I think we can usually pull off a victory if we stick together.  And you'd think I'd just leave the dungeon and hunt elsewhere, right?  No, I'm going to beat the stupid gobbies and show them who's the idiot, er, boss.  Another 5 hours down the drain...how can I play for 10 hours and not get anywhere? <BR>  <BR> Raleran <BR> Feeling slightly better now <BR> Cursed, Tunare-forsaken, permantly pegged at level 26.5 Druid <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/uwhytenose.showPublicProfile>Whytenose</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/8/99 10:41:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> if it makes you feel better...</span><hr size=1> When you hit level &quot;51&quot; you wont have exp loss anymore =) <p>Filee Whytenose.

<br>
There is nice, and there is silly. That was silly. That was the only &quot;good&quot; thing that happened to you and you GAVE it away. *sigh*. I would have appologized because the spawn did jump me and I would have had to defend yourself but I would not give up the loot. You did nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
Sol A is tough. I tried to solo it a bit last night with my Druid and had to zone a few times. Stuff at zone is blue at 24.<br>
<br>
My Rogue can solo there, but only carefully as Gobos by nature tend to be VERY aggro. Even at 44 stuff at zone swarms me. Best bet here, get camo'd go to barroom and get BEHIND the bar. Not even the 2 spawns facing you will aggro and the only spawn you need to directly deal with is what ever is behind the bar. <p><body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>
