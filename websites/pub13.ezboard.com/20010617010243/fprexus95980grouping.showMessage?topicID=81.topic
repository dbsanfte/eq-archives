<br>
Many of my questions were answered and it was just overall fun to learn what and how you all do your Barding.  So I thought maybe we could keep it rolling here where it's not so likey to dissappear in the midst's of time and post's.<br>
<br>
So in response to some of the terrific responses I recieved I have this to say:<br>
<br>
Dolphin stated that when in t a tank group to use the tanks to keep the MoBs aggro off of you so that you the Bard can get unrestricted swinging on the back.  Well I have tried this several times and still I get the aggro everytime to where I am usually the only one to take hits until I am dead or running!  LOL  Perhaps My weapons and songs are too aggro'ing for the tank's taunting?  (I use a fast hard hitting shortsword and a Thulian Claw).  And of course I seldom find a tank heavy group.  (go figure:-)<br>
<br>
Koi.  You suggested using Denon's or Chords rather than Bellow.  At present I am getting 14 DAM every 18 sec's from Bellow.  (If my singing is not disrupted).  It seems Chords would give only 8 and Denon's only 10.  (Though an added MoB drop in AC from Denon's).  So wouldn't Bellow be better till higher levels?<br>
<br>
And both Koi and Dolphin agree that instruments are the way to go and I agree.  What I could sure use here is a tip on speedy instrument changing while twisting at the same time.  (I have yet to get a group where this has been an option yet though).<br>
<br>
And then Koi you also mentioned using Psalm (Which I recently have recieved.) for a DS.  The Psalm of Warmth description in the book says Cold Resist.  Though at the Concert Hall it is also a debuffer.  Are you thinking of a different Psalm?  For some reason the books stopped describing in detail the Song effects after mid twenties.  LOL  (Go figure)!<br>
<br>
Oh and yes Dolphin I will and have been working on my Sneak and Hide and Safe Fall all to little use.  Of course my ability is all but nill.  Am I right in thinking that you MUST move to sneak, MUST NOT move to hide?  Is there a button to push to Safe Fall or is it automatic?<br>
<br>
Am I bugging you all yet?  LOL<br>
<br>
On Macro'ing.  Is it Macro'ing to park your nose against the edge of a land mass that you can't climb out of and swimm for hours going no where but up in ability?  I learned with the Jig O'Vigor and this tactic I could get up in skill swiftly.  (And wow what a trip to learn you could sing and swim!  (And underwater yet))!<br>
<br>
You all named several songs that are great Taunters.  Is there one song that sticks out as the most powerful?  I have a bit of a time getting the MoB to aggro back onto me after Adiera has dropped a nuke.  (Lot of panic attacks there)!<br>
<br>
Oh and Styrbjorn.  We would love to group with ya even though your at our level range limit.  At present we are in Qeynos after some downtime due to IRl sickness.  We have a few more things to pick up in Erudin and we will then most likely be heading back that way.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the next and last question of this post.  Where would you hunt as a 25th Bard with your favorite 25th Magician?  And where if you could get a group?  What kind of group would you want where?<br>
<br>
Ok that was three questions!  LOL  I will cut this off today but we are upcoming.  So it would be great to keep the ideas flowing.  Might even start a thread for Adiera's Magician so's she can get some ideas.  Her first problem is going to be spell research!  LOL<br>
<br>
Well thaqnks in advance from Meloden for keeping this thread alive.<br>

Regarding song damage. DOT songs take a while, not my favorite group tactic. I don't think the math is right with below vs chords/denons. Particularly with instruments. DOTs last for three ticks, so they constantly dish out damage. I used this to drop blues at level 20. Too tired to figure the comparison. But i think DOTs dish more hurt than below.<br>
<br>
Regarding taunt. A high DD nuke will taunt very heavy. you will have a hard time getting him back.<br>
<br>
Regarding psalm of warmth. it is a 8 pt DS that stacks with mage DS. <br>

They do not do dmg instantly. They do dmg after 3, 6 and 9 seconds. If you refresh the song at 8 seconds, it will do dmg at 3,6, 8+3 (11), 14, 19, 22, etc ... you will not get the full effect, so when using dot songs, twist in 4 songs, and make SURE you do not do it fast enough to have all 4 up at all times (which a good bard can when concentrating under good conditions)<br>

Grouping and tactics.</span><hr size=1> I guess I missed this one the first time (I don't swing by here too much). Prexus has a really great group of high level bards (lower levels too I'm sure but I don't know them ;) who had a lot of good comments.<br>
<br>
Just a few very general comments:<br>
<br>
Mob agro- I firmly believe that the closer you are the more likely you are to be attacked. I learned from Thalish all about this way back in the day. Back before they had evade we could control the mobs facing somewhat by getting on both sides of the mob and I would be right on it and she would be at the edge of melee range. I could give her more back stabs and when I got too hurt I'd back to the edge of melee and let it beat on her ;-) Seriously though, learn to just be on the edge of melee range if you wanna go in swinging but not get the beat down.<br>
<br>
Psalms of Cooling/Warmth- These songs do give a DS based on singer level (10 at 55 I think). These stack with any other DS but honestly don't see much use in my weave. They get broken out the most in groups with 2 bards in a few situations.<br>
<br>
Pixie Strike/Song of Twilight (SoT)- I have not used Pixie since they lowered the second resist check, but even in the bad old days it was useful for MAYBE locking 2 mobs down. It can also be very useful for locking one mob down for spawn breaking (chain mez it until you want to kill the mob to get the spawn set up right). Can also be very useful if you do not have a reliable stunner to interupt casting when fighting nasty casters.<br>
<br>
Drums vs Swords- Personally I say go with what you like. I like swinging weapons (made more attractive with breath of harmony because when wielding that sword I can add an extra song to the weave). I'd like to think I'm as useful as a bard who plays all intruments. I got great respect for the awesome job bards who whip out the drums etc do, but I just don't enjoy it as much. I've parsed my logs since level 30 or so and I think weapons and singing work pretty good. At the same know when you bust an intrument out!<br>
<br>
Know your group! If I am light on healing with a lot of melee power that is plowing through mobs then waiting on the shaman/druid before the next my focus is reduce damage, heal/mana, speed kill. If it's me, 2 clerics (yeah right, that could happen) and 3 tanks then I probably need to buff the tanks to high heaven so they can kill fast, etc.<br>
<br>
Make sure your group knows you. For example the level 55 mana song is basically unlimited sta regen, clarity2, and level 6 heal song in one. If you have a lute in inbetween battles/all the time/etc let your shaman know that they can wince for mana. If they sit at full life and OOM for half the night somethings wrong there.<br>
<br>
Learn song/spell stacking- When casting class X joins the group warn them that X won't stack/you are handling X/or you need to drop a song so thay can get X to stack with your song (casters get really annoyed when they waste mana on buffs that don't stack ;-).<br>
<br>
Now for the top 5 signs you sing the mana song too much (all in good humor, please don't take offense).<br>
<br>
5. Druid_01 tells the group, 'Hey can I get FS mace to work on 1H Blunt inbetween casting?'<br>
<br>
4. Enchanter_02 tells the group, 'I'm not casting Clarity anymore, can I pull now?'<br>
<br>
3. Mage_03 tells the group, '10 skill increases on Divination off True North in the last 5 minutes!'<br>
<br>
2. Cleric_04 tells the group, 'Nuking target now!'<br>
<br>
and last but not least....<br>
<br>
1. Warrior_05 tells the group, 'So that's what my mana bar looks like full!'<br>

Grouping and tactics.</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info people!  :-)<br>
<br>
First to Koi.  I looked again and it seems Chord's and Denon's are actually on six second timers so that IMo Chords would be doing at my level around 24 HP per 18 sec and Denon's around thirty.  thus yes much better than the 14 HP I would be getting off Bellows in a twist.  Now Bellows alone would be better but I do like keeping my group happy!  :-)<br>
<br>
Elloden.  Excellent advice!  Of course most of what you mentioned is a ways beyond me yet.  But the info will be recorded and used.  And I too like to keep my weapons in hand though I would like to know of an easy way to switch instruments during twisting for that time that may come when I can sit back and flail with my hands and be the Bard!<br>
<br>
And Aebriol.  I am beginning to think that my book is screwy and it is a new Kunark edition.  Looking at your numbers it would seem to me that I would be doing double the damage with my DoT's???  ie.  If they are on three sec intervals rather than six???<br>
<br>
At present I switch instruments by having a hot key bank with my INV and MELEE slots available.  I use the mouse to trade the instruments / weapons around.  With the second or two pause this causes can you effectively twist three songs using three different instruments?  Or do you limit it to two songs or limit it to two instruments?<br>
<br>
If I was to start kiting with Adiera the Magician.  Would I sing a couple of DoT's and a slow debuff while running backwards in circles around her?  Would we then want her pet to be Taunting or Rooting?  (Thinking of MoBs in and around LOIO).<br>
<br>
What would be the first most important magical instrument a level 25 Bard and his sidekick a 25 Magicaian and possibly some like leveld friends to go for?  MistMoore Drum?  Nostrolo's Tambourine?  Gypsy Lute?<br>
<br>
Anyways this is great!  And thank you very much Koikeeper for the continued support of my thread.<br>

Also, there are times instruments are useful and times when they aren't.  Just gotta play around with them.  Tho, by about level 18+, boastful bellow is owned by dots on usefulness to party and damage dealth.  And it just gets worse higher level you are, I haven't touched boastful bellow in a long time.  It does like 28 dmg a nuke for me, and my dots do around 50 a tick each and stacking up 3 is no problems.<br>
<br>
As for switching instruments, I probably have the same setup you do.  Bank 4 of my hotkeys are setup like this.  1 and 2 are my melee weapons slots.  The other 8 hotkeys are just a direct mapping of my inventory.  Then I leave the instrument I am gonna swap in next on my mouse pointer as I play a song.  Then when that song plays, I stop it, start the song for the next instrument, then go to hotbank 4 and swap in the instrument as the song gets going.  It only checks the instrument right as the song plays, not when you start it or as it gets going.<br>

Grouping and tactics.</span><hr size=1> Thank you and thank you Dolphin!  The mouse pointer trick for instrument switching did the trick splendidly!  (But what happens when your three songs in your twist require three different instruments)?  I managed my first ever solo against blues using not but a pure song attack!<br>
<br>
But now for some more questions.<br>
<br>
Solon's Song of the Siren's.  (Charm).<br>
<br>
I worked extensively with the song and my group last night.  I am having some serious problems trying to get it to work as it's descriptions says it should.  My problem is as follows.  I would charm a MoB.  I would run it around with ease till I found a second MoB.  I would target second MoB (With charm still in effect on first MoB). and tell charmed MoB to Attack.  Well now I would have two MoBs aggroed on ME!  LOL  It seems that with the charm still playing when I targeted the second MoB it became charmed.  Thus one MoB attacking me and one MoB attacking the one attacking me.<br>
<br>
To get it to work for me it seemed that the best way was to go charm one then aggro another.  Then tell charmed MoB to Guard Me causing it to attack the other aggroed MoB.  And since I would be attacking nothing they would then fight it out till charm wore off then I would have both again till charm kicked back in.  I got this to work for me but I still think this should be more efficient.<br>
<br>
So now my questions:<br>
<br>
1.)  How do you time it to get the least charm downtime on the MoB?<br>
Do you wait for the song to fade or re-engage before it fades?  I tried both ways several times and it was 50-50 whether I got whacked again or not.  (Yes I realize I should back way off using the range of the charm and the speed of my Accelerando to keep safe distance away).<br>
<br>
2.)  How do you inform your group of which Monster to attack and which is Mezzed/Charmed?<br>
I have a hot key set up for when I pull that tells the group I am Mezzing/Charming X MoB.  But what of the case of two Sarnak Recruits?  I normally would have the tanks assist me after a pull when using Lullaby.  But if I have to target the Mob to Charm/Mez and want the group to attack the other, what then?<br>
<br>
3.)  How do you time your re-charm/mez of Solon's/Pixie Stike?<br>
What I am looking for is the maximum effect and least amount of uncharmed/unmezzed time here.<br>
<br>
4.)  I was also accused of KS'ing last night.  So does Solon's Song of the Siren's have an aggro effect on any other MoBs than the one you are charming?<br>
Or is it more likely that the fellow had just utilized to soft a pull and when I ran by his pull with my train his MoB just aggroed to me normally?  (While practicing these new techniques I do tend to use a good chunk of the zone).<br>
<br>
Anyways that is enough for now.  I would love to seeing more of us Bards get together to share some of the better kept info with one another.<br>

Grouping and tactics.</span><hr size=1> Well Melodan on charming you might try it this way.  Advance on the mobs you want to fight and then target the one that is farthest from you, when you charm it, it immediately takes on the factions or so forth that make it amiable to you. It will also start to walk towards you past the other mob.  Good thing about this method is that if the mob it passes doesn't like you chances are it will not like your new pet and start attacking the pet.  Then play 2 other songs that pulse to get the effects and twist in Solon's as the 3rd song.  This should enable you to get the charm back on right as it wears off or very soon thereafter so as to recharm before it can get close enough to hit you.<br>
<br>
It has worked well for me and is best used when you are fighting static spawns.  Wandering mobs make it a little harder to do it this way.<br>
