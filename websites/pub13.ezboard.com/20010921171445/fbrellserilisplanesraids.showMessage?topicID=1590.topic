I mean it is understood still that Ragefire is unreservable correct?  I understand that maybe it is your intention to do Rage if he is up, but in all honesty someone can still take him out ahead of your FG raid. <p><center>

By attempting to claim Ragefire you cause further bottlenecks in an epic quest that is already bottlenecked at that spot. <p><center>

<br>
1. Nagafen is not killed on pop (due to too long tolerance time for Nagafen raids).<br>
2. Reservability of Firegiants, which prevents Ragefire from being killed on pop.<br>
<br>
These two things make a very easy epic quest hard.<br>

<br>
In fact, ragefire is NOT &quot;reservable&quot;,<br>
but on the other hand he is &quot;CAMPABLE&quot;.<br>
<br>
You can't reserve frenz in guk, but you can camp and wait his spawn.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is NOT FFA, he is FCFS.<br>
Whoever breaks room (FG area) will get the camp spot until next spawn cycle.<br>
This is common rule.<br>
That's why ppl try to kill FG and get into Lair to wait him.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can camp stony room and can track.<br>
But, what will you do if someone starts clearing FG before you touch on it?.<br>
Will you shout,&quot;I got him on track first, it's mine!&quot;<br>
and jump up on the FG hunt?<br>
Or will you scream,&quot;Rage is FFA, i say FFA so it's FFA!&quot;<br>
and gather ppl before they do and kill Rage?.<br>
It's nothing but rob.<br>
If someone is sitting in lair,<br>
or someone is clearing FG, &quot;IT IS CAMPED&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;whoever get enough ppl first will get Ragefire&quot;<br>
Some ppl say this but this is WRONG.<br>
Frenz in guk spawns, campers begin buff/medi for it,<br>
but while this, someone come and &quot;engage&quot; frenz first.<br>
Then the person says&quot;i engaged first, so this is not KS&quot;.<br>
You can see the point.<br>
<br>
Only the exception is, when the camper doesn't have power to do Ragefire.<br>
Some crazy cleric would camp it 24 hours 7 days,<br>
even if his guildmates/friends are not online<br>
he can camp and claim it alone.<br>
Or Level50 guildless cleric can sneak up into lair when FG is dead and camp it.<br>
This will waste Ragefire, because these ppl can't make it.<br>
In this case, first person who have enough ppl, should kill Rage.<br>
<br>
IMO.<br>

<br>
The history of the server has been that if a person has been camping a spawn and the mob spawns that they have first right to engage it within a reasonable time. It is frowned upon having another group just swoop in and kill it from you while you are buffing or preparing.<br>
<br>
The same should happen for Ragefire. If a cleric/tracker/monk was camping him and he spawned then I as another cleric coming in should give a reasonable time for the other cleric to engage him. This time may include gathering of the forces, buffing and then fighting. However that time should not be lvl5x looking for people to help me please take down ragefire.<br>
<br>
I think it is wrong for a cleric to hold up another cleric from getting their epic because they can not get the forces together to take him down and thus keeping him hostage for hours on end.<br>
<br>
It all gets down to what is a reasonable time to wait. Cause the quicker Rage goes down the quicker another one will spawn for the next cleric. On some servers it is total FFA (YAY nice fights /shudder), on some they have a list and when it is that clerics turn they must camp him 24/7 and have up to 2 hours to take him down when he spawns. On ours you can camp him from the zone, stoney or the lair but how much time do you give them to take Rage down?<br>
<br>
You have FG scheduled raids to deal with, so the waiting time may force the additional wait for up to 8 hours <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but if the FG's are cleared with no conflict to them I could see giving the cleric about 30 - 60 mins. Any well connected cleric by the time they go to do epics should be able to get forces on route by then. If they can't they don't deserve the cleric epic. Harsh? Maybe or Maybe not.<br>
<br>
This opinion is mine and not necessarily that of the Gnome community.<br>
<br>
I would just like to add that I think the Stoney room is an acceptable camp spot because Brell forces people to a FG reservation system. If I do not want to violate the Reservation system on FG's then this is the closest I may be able to get is the Stoney room. The Zone line is not an acceptable spot to claim the camp. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unasren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nasren</A> at: 5/10/01 12:21:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uquemnwyndrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quemn Wyndrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Assist Dammit!</span><br>  Posts: 910<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/10/01 12:21:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Attempting to Reserver Ragefire</span><hr size=1> i dont understand the arguement here...as i see it, people kill FG's and if ragefire up, they take a whack at him... right? <p><center><a href=http://www.geocities.com/quemnthebard><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~qthebard/_images/quemnsig4.jpg border=0></a></center>

That is why they are still reservable right???? Not for loot hungry farmers. Not for people staking a claim on a non reservable mob.<br>
<br>
Sorry to be sarcastic but people are reserving the fg's as a way to claim ragefire. Ragefire is not reservable.<br>
<br>
The problem comes into play when a cleric or his fellow guildmates have gotten a monk fd in the lair to camp the spawn location and it spawns but because fg's are reservable. Say there is a raid in 1 hour so you the cleric not wanting the hassle of breaking the FG reservation system wait for the FG raid group to take them down so you can bring in your raid crew.<br>
<br>
But low and behold they finish clearing the FG's they reserved only to have a cleric in them that was going after Ragefire and thus they try to claim him. Who has the correct claim? The person who camped ragefire and had a group on stand by because he followed the rules of Brell? Is it the person who twisted the use of the FG reservation system so they could hold hostage the Ragefire raid? <br>
<br>
That is what this thread is about. A thread that is trying to bring to attention the abuse of the FG system and to try and put an end to it. The rest of it is more of a discussion on what makes a Ragefire camp a valid claim.<br>
<br>
You can not stop people from making bad FG reservations unless you cry out enough about it.<br>
