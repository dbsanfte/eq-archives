The struggle *of* Ghoulbane</span><hr size=1> As I knelt before the altar of Mithaniel Marr I began to pray; &quot;Hearken I beseech thee, O god of truth, designer of the right and just, provider for the poor and humble.  May you fill thy heart with compassion and thy soul with humility, may your servant walk on the path of truth and your words and deeds be on thy heart.  May I be girded in your strength and shielded from temptation; may I serve you first in my heart and then in deeds my lord.&quot;  That's when I heard a whispering voice, barely audible say to me, &quot;stand up good and faithful servant.&quot;  As I stood, a great light appeared before me and it began to speak: knew that this light was Marr himself. <br>
<br>
&quot;A long time ago I heard the cries of this knight and poured out my mercy on him.  These lands were in the middle of a battle of good and evil and this small faction of knights pleaded for assistance.  I took pity on them and forged a sword with my own hands to assist them.  This knight was given the holy sword empowered to slay undead and he used it bravely in battled.  His army suffered great losses but they were able to take this region in my name.  I was so proud of my servant and he was appointed Shin Lord over this land.  Years of peace and prosperity reigned in the land and the Shin Lord allowed the evil seed of contentment to take root in his people.  Undead frogs began to appear in the lower levels and Ogres and Trolls began to appear in the swamp.  The Shin Lord and his followers instead of attacking turned their backs and allowed the seed to sprout.  As the evil forces began to attack, they withdrew to the upper caves not wanting to suffer huge losses again.  Evil flourished without any opposition and soon it was apparent that their defenses wouldn't be able to hold any longer.  Knowing that they couldn't sustain a war on two fronts, they decided to align themselves with their undead kin in the lower levels thus allowing the sprout of evil to produce fruit. Their lack of faith has resulted in their eyes being blinded from the truth; they saved their bodies only to have their souls condemn by me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then the image wavered and I saw Marr standing before me with an outstretched finger pointing at me - &quot;I am giving over these knights to their evil hearts.  You are being sent to carry out my judgment against them.  You are to slay the knight known as the Shin Lord.  Upon his death, my judgment of truth will transform his outward appearance into the evil creature that he has become - he will be forever known as the Ghoul Lord!  Do not be deceived by impostors, the real Shin Lord wields the holy sword known as GhoulBane.  I am giving this sword to you now my good and faithful servant.  Do not forget its past and do not forget this Day of Judgment.” <br>
<br>
Then I opened my eyes and I was standing before the altar of Marr.  My body was covered with sweat, heart pounding and my hands and legs were trembling.  I dropped to my knees, struggling to think about something else; trying to dismiss this as a terrible dream.  Back in the deep recesses of my mind a small voice was trying to be heard.  The voice struggled though my defenses until it was nearly addible; I tried despertly to silence it and force it back down.  Finally, unable to hold it back the unrelenting voice any longer, the tiny voice became loud resonating scream within my head, “I’m being sent to kill a fellow Paladin!”<br>
<br>
Sir Tolecnal du'Lac<br>
<br>
In this world you are either good or evil, and the worst of these is neutral.  I trust good with my life and I distrust evil always, but neutral who was my friend has just killed me.<br>

The struggle *of* Ghoulbane</span><hr size=1> I never killed Ziglark Whisperwing, did his quest for the key instead. It was actually much much faster to equip a guild with keys the first few days of velious doing the quest enmass rather then camping him for keys.<br>
<br>
Really tho a paladin shouldnt be put in such a position to kill other paladins for loot. Any such action should strip their divine skills and render them a mere warrior. Especially an action like killing tunare etc.<br>
<br>
Holy swords etc should really only come from quests, and from slaying evil that captured the weapons from other paladins. But, one shouldnt kill a paladin to get them.<br>
<br>
But, EQ hardly requires one to hold to the ideals so guess nothing ya can do about it.<br>
<br>
Least they have a quest for ghoulbane now. Yes, i murdered the shin lord just like everyone else from that era heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvarutiasilvon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varutia Silvon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/2/02 1:11:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Remember the old days?

The struggle *of* Ghoulbane</span><hr size=1> This is what I thought should have been done concerning Holy and Unholy weapons.<br>
<br>
A paladin would never kill a good being and use his weapons. Likewise no one else would be worthy enough to wield such items. Thus all dropped Holy weapons wouldn't be useable by anyone. Shadowknights would be able to use that dropped weapon in a quest that would corrupt it into a shadowknight useable Unholy blade.<br>
<br>
Various Shadowknight MoBs would also carry Unholyblades that were once Holy. Paladins could take these drops to their temples and have them 'cleansed' back into holyweapons useable by Paladins.<br>
<br>
This way you would have Paladins only killing evil MoBs for holy weapons, but shadowknights could either kill Paladin MoBs  or ShadowKnight MoBs for their unholy weapons (perhaps give them an incentive to kill Paladins though). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showPrevMessage?topicID=133.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showNextMessage?topicID=133.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=5><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.emailToFriend?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.threadControl?topicID=133.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=133.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=133.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm21">Class Balancing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern>God's Might</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
