Through bleary eyes he he looks around, lifting his head slightly to find himself in a cot, stripped naked with roughly cured skins thrown over him for warmth. Sitting up he discovers himself in a crude tent, the only light coming from a small oil lamp sputtering in the center of the tent, giving off a thick but strangely scented smoke of some unknown herbs before drifting off through the hole in the roof designed for such purpose.<br>
  &quot;Lay down my friend, you have suffered much&quot;, come a soft and gravelled voice and Abrac feels a gentle pressure on his chest. &quot;You were close to death from your wounds and over drawing of the magical essense so much that your own life force was being consumed&quot;, the voice continues. &quot;You should be more careful&quot;<br>
  Abrac remembers the familiar caution of his old shamanistic friend Torokk, and he relaxes, allowing the pressure on his chest to push him back down to the cot. Abrac closes his eyes as the memories of that battle return, and the old pain with it. &quot;I will say now what I said then&quot;, Abrac mutters in a harsh a voice as he could muster, &quot;you should have let me die, then I may have found peace at last&quot;<br>
  Turokk says nothing, but inspects his friend with a critical eye. His wounds had healed, leaving only faint scars, his breathing was strong and even, he looked to be in fine condition despite the recent rigours he had subjected himself to. Turokk shifted to the sight od spirit, and inspected Abrac once more. He gasped as Abrac's spirit come into focus, his bright scarlet spirit was streaked with black, disease ridden geen and yellow marred its once pure light with hatred and self loathing. &quot;no wonder he wishes for death&quot;, he thinks, and focuses back on the physical world &quot;such pain and burden that he carries within him.<br>
  &quot;Tell me Abrac, tell me what it is that burdens your soul so&quot;, he asks his voice thick with concern. Abrac's eyes snap open, and he turns to look into Turokks single eye with his own flaring ones. &quot;Is it mot enough that I must carry my burden and shame, must I also bare it to you so that you can see how worthless and foolish I have become?&quot; &quot;I am your friend Abrac, and one of the advantages of that is that I can perhaps lighten the load for you, take some of that pain from you and help you find your way&quot;, he replies &quot;But this I can only do if you share it&quot;<br>
  Abrac holds his gaze, then as suddenly as the fire in his eyes came, it fizzles and dies. Abrac collapses back to the bedding and closed his eyes tightly. &quot;I cannot continue to deny you the knowledge that you seek, though the horrors you will witness will sicken your soul, I have not the strength to keep them from you anymore. Tomorrow night, when I have recovered my strength and made certain preparations, I will show you, for only after you have seen with your own eyes can you fully understand my shame, and my failure&quot;<br>
  Turokk nods and turns away, &quot;Take your time my friend, on the morrow I will be ready&quot; he say in a firm voice, though the tone that Abrac had just used, and the anguish in his voice had sent silvers of ice into his heart, slivers of fear and dread.<br>
<br>
  Turokk awakes early the next morning to find Abrac missing, his gear and pouch of mystical tomes and artifacts gone, yet a pot of the usual gruel that humans call porridge set up thoughfully, and bubbling quietly over the campfire. &quot;Ah,Ii see not the value humans place in this slop, yet he has prepared it for me and it is but a small burden to eat it, after all, it would not be right to ignore such a gesture&quot; he thinks to himself. Turokk then curses his own sense of right for talking him into such a chore, but nevertheless settles down and begins to eat the greyish looking slop.<br>
  Sometime later Turokk notices the hackles on his ever present spirit guardian rise, and grwol emenate from deep within it's chest. He looks up to see Abrac striding into the small emcampment,his face grim, and an aura of determination about him. &quot;Easy boy&quot;, Turokk reassures, and absent mindedly scratches his wolf behind the ears, and he looks up at Abrac with a questioning expression on his face.<br>
  &quot;It is time&quot;, Abrac says quietly, his voice low and harsh &quot;Now you will see that which is my shame.&quot; He turns on his heel and strides briskly into the forest, his robes gleaming in the the light of the full moon which has just barely crested the horizon. Cuaght off gaurd, Turrok scrambles up to his feet, snatching up his mace and shield from the rack by the tent, and issues a curt command &quot;Follow&quot; to his spirit gaurdian as he follows after Abrac.<br>
  The trail is narrow and twisted, strange shadows formed by the moon seem to move, and as the journey continues a strange silence falls...all except for a faint unnatural humming. The humming grows louder as the two men continue, until they finally reach a wise clear spot in the thick forest. In the center of the clearing is a small fire set in the middle of a large circle. All around the circle rune have been meticulously scribed, thier edges faintly glowing, and this, Turokk realizes, is the source of the humming.<br>
  Abrac motions for Turokk to stand in a smaller circle near the fire,&quot;Whatever you do, do not move from that place until it is over.&quot; Turokk blinks, &quot;Until what is over?&quot;, he asks, but Abrac has already turned away and is busily setting up some kind of tripod over the fire. Once complete Abrac reaches into his robe and withdraws a crystal sphere, maybe six inches in diameter and set it upon the tripod. Waving his hands slowly over the sphere and muttering incantations to himself the sphere seems to grow in size until it is a whole five feet across, glowing faintly blue, and no longer claer, but seeming to hold within it a white swirling mist.<br>
  Abrac nods to himself in satisfaction and enters a second circle on the far side of the sphere and looks up at Turokk. &quot;This circle will take us outside of time, and will allow us to capture a view of reality inside that globe. It is know that time cycles, and so to view the past we must traverse backwards, and this may only be done within the circle of the globe. There you will find the answers you seek Turokk, and I must live through my pain once more. Step not from the circle in which you stand, for it is what protects you from the lack of time. Step outside and there is only oblivion&quot;, he warns, his voice harsh and insistant.<br>
  &quot;Look into the globe and see that which you have come to find.&quot;, Abrac commands, and lifts his arms to begin the ritual. Two bolts of electric blue flash out to strike Abrac square in the chest from the outer circle, the enrgies twisting and surging like a pair of angry electric snakes. Abrac focuses his will and a soft pale beam of light flows from him to strike the globe, causing it to shimmer and the mist to clear. Outside the outer circle a dome appears, shielding what is outside from view, like some red shimmering curtain.   Turokk turns his attention back to the globe where an image has formed, that of a beautiful High Elf priestess, her golden brown hair tied back into a ponytail, a dark maroon tunic covering her chest and torso, and leather boots and skirt of excellent craftmanship, completing the ensemble. All about she wore artifacts and jewelry of religious significance, the only blemish in this angelic picture a small mole by the corner of her mouth. A golden tiara rests on her brow, and deep blue eyes full of compassion and kindness look out, framed by delicate, yet elegant brows.<br>
 &quot;This was my wife, Sian'Tora...or in human Sandra&quot;, whispers Abrac. &quot;A more beautiful creature in both looks and spirit has never walked this land before or since. She captured my cold heart and breathed warmth back into it, and somehow I managed to bring her joy. She saw some value in me that I never could fathom.&quot; Abrac bows his head for a moment lost in memory, then returns to the task at hand. He closes his eyes in concentration and the electric energies jump from one rune, to the next one in the circle, the glow beoming darkes, more intense, the writhing more pronounced. The image in the globe shifts two show Abrac and Sandra on a small rocky island, surrounded by sirens, thier heavanly voices lifted in a song of celebration as the two people exchanged vows. &quot;We wed on this small island in the Ocean of tears, no family or friends, a private ceremony where we bound our souls together for life. It was one of the happiest times of my life&quot; A slight smile appears on Abrcs lips as he views the image, and a single tear for his love runs down his cheek. &quot;We traveled the lands together, fighting for what just causes we found. She taught me to care for others and thier plights, and I taught her the strength and fire of allowing passion to fuel your determination, your actions&quot; The image shifts, showing the two partners fighting goblins in the icey north lands of Halas, fould undead creatures that haunt the old abandoned manor of unrest, and many other foes and supporters of evil. <br>
  &quot;All was well until one day, when I was seeking after the famous crafters of special clerical amour, to bring her a gift both useful and of surprassing beauty to match her own, she met him.&quot;,Abrac sneers and his face twists in hatred as the image shifts to show that of a Tier'Dal, red eyes blazing, a scowl seemingly etched on his pale blue face. &quot;She met him as she was attempting to rid the swamps of innothule of the foul spectres that lurk in its murk waters. He too said he was thier to fight evil for the cause of good. She was sceptical at the time, but his cunning words and her forgiving nature beguiled her. There was nothing I could do. He told her of a mask that would tranform her to the shape of a Tier'Dal, so that she may bring the message of love to those people, and slowly guide them away from the path of hate.&quot;<br>
 More tears began to flow silently down Abrac's cheeks, his eyes filled with misery as he continued,&quot;Very well I said, confidant in the belief I could protect her from any harm this scheming creature could try to cause. How wrong I was in my pride and arrogance.&quot; Abrac concentrates again and the electric energies once again jump to the next, and final set of runes, arcing and spitting, a deep angry blue glow as if they would devour this man that held them in thrall.<br>
  &quot;Needles to say, we entered the lower halls of undead plagued Guk to win this mask. We succeeded, and with my own hand I gave her the mask that she sought, despite the evil I felt within it. After all, no evil hed defeated me yet, what could this mask do threaten me, or my lovely bride?&quot; The globe shows Abrac handing Sandra a silvery mask of twisted countennace, one that coverd the nose and head leaving the mouth and jaw free, and Sandra donning the mask, activating the long dormant power within. A green yellow glow surrounds Sandra, her form changes and she emerges as a tall, yet strangely beautiful Tier'Dal, a small scowl marring the beauty of that finely chizeled face.<br>
  &quot;Little did I know that not only did the mask transform form, it also warped and twisted the spirit, much like how the Tier'Dal were born, only it did not fully complete the job, but left her as an abomination of hate and love twisted together, not of her own race, and not of thiers, leaving just enough of her left to be horrified by what she had become&quot; The globe flashed through several images, some of Sandra in her own for, her face twisted in self loathing at the things she had done and was helpless to stop, and others of the scowling Tier'Dal, torturing and slaying helpless innocents, only the eyes betraying the horror the soul within felt.<br>
  &quot;The mask binds itself to her soul, it cannot be removed lest you rend her soul apart, and it is beyond my power, or any power I know to break. It is also addictive, more and more time she had to spend wearing the mask, and the more she wore it, the stronger it grip on her became.&quot; Abrac sobs in grief for his lost love, his concentration lapsing and the electric bolts begining to break free of his control, burning his clothes and hands as they struggle to consume him. Turokk, forgetting his friends warning, begins to take a step forward to try to assist his friend. Abrac snaps back to full concentration, clamping his will firmly on the energies surrounding him and barking out at Turokk &quot;STOP! You will doom us both, step back!&quot;. Turokk stops at Abracs command and puts his foot firmly back on the ground, somewhat chagrined at his almost disaterous mistake.<br>
  Abrac concentrates once more and the blue energies fizzle and abate, the white beam of light slowly dies as the red shimmering curtain raises allowing view of the outside world once more. Abrac sinks to the ground, grief an exhaustion getting the better of him, and he looks up with eyes focused on something only he can see. &quot;The last is too near our current time to show you. Finally she succumbed to the taint of the mask and went to my home villiage and slaughtered everyone. She took days to torture and slowly kill everyone there, that damned Tier&quot;Dal laughing all the while, encouraging her to greater excess. I stood by and watched, I could not bring myself to harm her still, despite what she had become, and saw as she slew my entire family. A patrol from freeport found me several days later, I can only think she let me live because she knew the torture I would suffer for the rest of my days. I told my story, and the malitia in freeport were not wholly convinced and I was banished from the lands of freeport for all time. I have no family, no home, my love is a twisted and tormented thing beyond help, and I brought it all about. I am worthless and I long for the oblivion of death&quot;<br>
  Turokk stood silently looking on at his tormented friend, wanting to help, but saying nothing but offering his silent support. Finally Abrac recovers some composure, and he and his friend return to the camp that had become home for the past few weeks. Upon reaching the camp Abrac shrugs off Turokks supporting hand and turns to him defiantly &quot;Never, shall I go by the name Pureflaim again, I am not worthy of that honour any longer. Nor shall I ever wear another name until such time as I have paid for all that I have done&quot; Abrac turned away, leaving Turokk standing doubfounded at this sudden outburst, before slowly following Abrac inside to make ready for sleep. After all, tomorrow was a new day, who knows what it might bring......<br>
