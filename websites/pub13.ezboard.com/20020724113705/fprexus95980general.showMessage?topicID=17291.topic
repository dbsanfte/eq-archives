Subject: Government/Alien Technology Needed! 14258 <br>
<br>
<br>
Hello,<br>
If you are a time traveler or alien and or in possession of government or alien technology I need your help! My entire life and health has been messed with by evil beings! If you have access to the carbon copy replica model #50 3000 series, the dimensional warp, temporal reversion or something similar please reply! I simply need the safest method of transferring my consciousness to my younger self with my current mind/memory.  I need an advanced time traveler to work with who can help me, I would prefer someone with access to teleportation as well as a variety different types of time travel.  This is not a joke! I am serious! Please send a separate email to me at: Dragonball03@aol.com if you can help!  Thanks<br>
 <p>Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

<br>
<br>
<br>
******** (12:34:59 AM): Excuse me, sir, but I have access to the Dimensional Warp<br>
Dragonball03 (12:35:20 AM): hello, excelent!<br>
Dragonball03 (12:35:30 AM): where might you be from?<br>
********(12:35:47 AM): I currently am residing in Trenton, NJ, but I can travel.<br>
********(12:35:57 AM): What exactly is it that you are looking to accomplish?<br>
Dragonball03 (12:36:24 AM): I simply need the safest and most effective possible way of returning to my younger 4 year old self permanently with my current mind/memory so that I can prevent the evil beings from messing with my entire life and health again. They have messed with my life and health in the worst possible way you can imagine, and now I am dying of CJD. I am not familiar with the device you have mentioned. Does it work in the same aspect as the replica? <br>
********(12:36:57 AM): Your 4 year old self? That might be a bit young to perform many tasks, do you agree?<br>
Dragonball03 (12:38:17 AM): my honest opinion is if my current mind were transferred I should be fine. I was exceptionally smart when I was 4<br>
********(12:39:30 AM): But you are aware that by doing this you will lose any and all sexual pleasure and it will be much harder to get by in the real world when you have the appearance of a 4 year old<br>
Dragonball03 (12:40:38 AM): yes I fully understand this, and that will be fine with me. I would feel just like myself then correct? I would not wan't to send an alert to the system of any kind and would act just like myself then as much as posible, and<br>
Dragonball03 (12:41:22 AM): only when neccerary prevent what was about to happen by the evil beings which would ruin my life forever<br>
********(12:41:37 AM): You would act the exact way you do now, only you would not have the muscle capacity/flexibility etc. that you do now<br>
********(12:41:45 AM): How much are you willing to pay for this?<br>
Dragonball03 (12:43:53 AM): Due to my circumstances, and being only 21 my lifes savings is $30,000. please explain what you mean by I would have the same  muscle capacity/flexibility etc my current mind would be transfered to my younger body, currect?<br>
********(12:44:25 AM): You would not be as strong as you are now basically, so many tasks would be very hard.<br>
********(12:44:45 AM): Do you happen to play the online RPG, Everquest?<br>
Dragonball03 (12:47:07 AM): I can't say I do, and yes I understand that, that is fine.  I am not 100% certain how the dimensional warp works as I am with the replica please explain<br>
********(12:48:08 AM): It actually works almost exactly like the replica however some of the molecular structure may be a bit different (ie: eye color, hair color, skin pigment, etc.)<br>
Dragonball03 (12:51:26 AM): how is this so exaclty? do you mean it enters into a wormhole, I thought that it tranfers my mind to my younger self exactly as he was then in energy form?<br>
********(12:53:03 AM): Yes, but see, using this method, sometimes the molecular structure of your former self is not always 100% the same, but by my calculations and past experiences, the upper quartile of users experience only a slight change of about .32%, leaving you 99.68% like your former self at age 4<br>
Dragonball03 (12:54:35 AM): what would happen to my self in this timeline here now after I went back? <br>
********(12:55:11 AM): You want to be able to jump between then and now??<br>
Dragonball03 (12:56:28 AM): no basically I am asking because I am wondering, if a copy of my mind is sent to my former self, would the me here now still be sufferteing and trying to go back, or would my timeline here be over written?<br>
********(12:57:53 AM): Basically your current self would cease to exist as we know it due to the randomocity of the composure of the human body. Think of it this way, it would be like your body would just change into the body of your 4 year old self, nothing else would change.<br>
Dragonball03 (12:59:38 AM): i was sent through time once, tell me if it is anything like this:<br>
Dragonball03 (12:59:40 AM): It happened one morning in late January of 1997 at 16, I got up at 6:00AM to take a shower and get ready for school. I got out of the shower at 6:30, I looked out the bathroom window and noticed sunrise and UFOs in the sky. I did not find this surprising because I use to see them all the time. I then got dressed and ready. Then when I walked out of the bathroom as soon as I entered into the hallway, pretty far away from any <br>
Dragonball03 (12:59:47 AM): windows now, then it happened! <br>
Dragonball03 (12:59:57 AM): It was like I stepped into an invisible doorway of some kind, In less then 1 second I saw a flash of white light and it seemed as if I rotated slightly with this tremendous force on my body and everything went blank for a second. The air was warm and dry for that quick second, I heard this click which sounded like a camera. And then it was over. There I was standing wondering what just happened. I will never forget what <br>
Dragonball03 (1:00:10 AM):  it was like! Still puzzled and confused I went downstairs to wake my Mom up to take me to school when I got an even bigger shock!!!! She said it's 12:30 at night, to go back to bed. I looked out her paddeo door and to my surprise it was pitch dark night time again! And that is how it happened. The people, and everything around me was the same! It was real!! This was all real which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that<br>
Dragonball03 (1:00:27 AM): time travel is possible for me. <br>
********(1:01:51 AM): Somewhat like that. But you see, it's not exactly &quot;time travel&quot; per se, it is really just transfering your current state of mind to your former self, at age 4.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:03:45 AM): now let me ask you, does it send my current mind back to part with my younger self or does it 100% replace my younger selfs mind?<br>
********(1:04:25 AM): Your mind will be exactly as it is now, 100%.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:05:47 AM): I would love to work with you! Please if you do not mind telling me, how you have access to this technology, if you are alien or human, if alien from which planet of these?<br>
Dragonball03 (1:05:49 AM): Travers<br>
Edenad<br>
Vadikar<br>
Nefarious<br>
Tralfamadore<br>
Valnator<br>
Zoltar<br>
Chiron<br>
Kozonia<br>
Zynopteron<br>
Nemesis<br>
********(1:07:25 AM): I am human, but I have had many out of body experiences and such, and have been perfecting this procedure for years upon end. Where I got the technology I must keep a secret, many of the doctors with whom I worked are shrouded in secrecy.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:09:23 AM): I see, have you gone back to your former self with the dimensional warp? Are you in this timeline as a result of coming back?<br>
********(1:09:55 AM): Not I myself, but many people I have helped transfer back into their former selves.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:11:27 AM): now from what I hear the dimensional warp takes a tremendous amount of energy to power, if this is so, what powers it?<br>
********(1:12:20 AM): Not exactly, there are different ways to harness and use the power. My colleagues and I have found a way to split atomic particles, much like an atomic bomb, and harness this enegry into the Dimensional Warp.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:13:28 AM): I see, might you have access to teleportation?<br>
********(1:13:38 AM): Working on it.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:14:42 AM): what exactly does the dimensional warp look like? how big is it?<br>
********(1:16:02 AM): The Dimensional Warp I use for patients looks somewhat like a metallic sphere in which the patient enters and then the atomic particles are charged in and around it. It is about 6.5 feet tall and 4 feet wide.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:18:35 AM): wow, now I am aware government oficials, and time gaurdians can track my devices as soon as they are energized to stop or come after you, does it offer any protection from that?<br>
********(1:19:38 AM): Once you are transformed into your former self you will not have to worry. My colleagues and I have very secretive ways to dispose quickly of the Dimensional Warp to heed any further hinderings of the project.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:22:14 AM): very good, now I wan't to have as good of an understnading of this as posible, so basically when I returned to my former self, I would feel exactly as I did then? How exaclt would you devine conciousnes? for example say one got hit by a car and had permenent brain damage, upon transfering thier conciousness would they be normal again?<br>
********(1:23:05 AM): No, if their mind was transferred then they would have the body of, say their 4 year old self, but with the brain damage they have now.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:26:58 AM): so like right now, for example I have CJD which is severely effecting my conciousness making me feel faint and dizzy at all times, my short term memory is almost non existent, my speach is getting worse, My balance and co-ordination is way off among many other things, if this is a result of the brain being damaged due to my concition, how would I not be then? I mean I don't understand this exactly, if I were to have my health brain that I did then<br>
********(1:27:33 AM): It means you would have a 2 inch penis, pretty much.<br>
********(1:27:35 AM): If that.<br>
********(1:29:14 AM): If you don't want my services, then you can take your pleadings elsewhere.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:29:47 AM): yes I realize that, but that is beside the point.  I mean if I have an ilness which is effecting my conciousnes now will it be transfered?<br>
Dragonball03 (1:29:59 AM): yes ofcourse I wan't your service! I need your help!<br>
********(1:31:10 AM): I'm sorry but I must be going now. You can call my organization though. Do NOT, I repeat do NOT give this phone number to ANYONE. 1-800-277-4653.<br>
<br>
(1-800-277-4653 is really 1-800-A$$HOLE)<br>
<br>
Dragonball03 (1:31:44 AM): ok thank you, when is a good time to call?<br>
********(1:32:10 AM): Between the hours of 8am and 10pm. Any day except Sunday.<br>
********(1:32:15 AM): Good night and good luck.<br>
Dragonball03 (1:32:40 AM): Thanks Rodney I will be calling you Monday, I am serious and really need your help!<br>
********(1:32:59 AM): No problem old chap.<br>
<br>
<br>
