<br>
******************<br>
<br>
A walk with Daddy<br>
<br>
“Daddy! It landed on my finger!” Maella squealed in delight.<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled broadly and laughed as his daughter ran after the fay drake, her long blonde ponytail bouncing at the back of her head. “Yes, sweetheart, they do. You would get more to land on you if you did not chase them all away.” He shook his head and smiled as Maella continued to run, unheeding his suggestion. He leaned casually against one of the large stone structures that made up the druid ring. The stone was soft with moss, proof it blended with nature rather than interfered with it.<br>
<br>
“Do not run too far Maella,” Mayt cried after his daughter as she ran in ever widening circles around the ruins. From her excited cries he thought she didn’t hear him. He scanned the horizon with his red eyes, looking for signs of orc parties. Even though Lesser Faydark was very close to his homeland, the Greater Faydark, he knew all too well that orcs had made many camps throughout the forest. In truth, the orcs were more plentiful in Greater Faydark than here. A wizard of his power had little to fear from common orcs, and he could destroy any orc with a small flick of his hand, but a little girl chasing after fay drakes was another matter entirely. Even so, Maella had been asking him to take her to see the fay drakes for months now, and he had finally relented. He held out his arm as a fay drake fluttered close by, its wings a chaotic jumble of red, blue and black. It landed on his hand lightly, closing its wings momentarily. How something so beautiful and innocent could live in a forest inhabited by all sorts of foul creatures was beyond him. He turned his head to glance toward the canyon leading into the castle of Mistmoore, emphasizing the point. His movement caused the fay drake to flutter away in search of more solid perches. Mayt watched it float lazily away and then looked around for his daughter.<br>
<br>
Stepping from the druid stones, he ran his eyes along the lush hills, searching for his little girl. A dagger of panic shot up his spine when he didn’t see her immediately, and he called out. “Maella? Where are you dear?” The sound of his voice died rapidly, absorbed by the thick forest. When she didn’t respond he broke into a run in the direction he had seen her last, his eyes darting along the grassy hills in the distance. “Maella!” he shouted again.<br>
<br>
He heard a giggle off to his left, turned quickly and ran toward the sound, his fears evaporating as quickly as they had grown. Seconds later he rounded a hill to see her chasing after another fay drake in the awkward running gait of a young child, laughing as she did. “Maella,” he said as sternly as he could. “I told you not to run off sweetheart.” He looked around and ran a hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
“Look Daddy! There’re three over here!” She said in an excited voice, oblivious to father’s concern. She ran toward a group of three fay drakes perched on an old fallen log, its form barely visible through the dense green moss growing upon it. The drakes scattered as she approached, and she re-doubled her efforts to catch them, her laughing continuous. In her excitement she stumbled on the log they had been occupying and fell to the ground in a flurry of grass, bark, legs and arms.<br>
<br>
Mayt struggled to fight the concern gripping him, commanding him to rush to her side and comfort her. He knew intellectually that he had to let her to develop her independence, but emotions fought a vicious battle against intellect, and they frequently won. He stood twenty feet from his daughter as she righted herself, his hand running through his hair once again.<br>
<br>
Maella scrambled to her feet, quite unharmed, and looked around to see where the drakes had fluttered. Mayt sighed and smiled. Once again his fears were misplaced; she was fine. Once she found the drakes again she was after them again and Mayt found himself wondering if her energy was boundless. He put his hands behind his back and walked after her. Just as she caught up to the small creatures, he noticed a movement at the crest of the hill in front of her. The figure stooped and scanned the area around it, moving its head stiffly across the horizon. When it saw the little girl at the base of the hill it growled and ran down toward her.<br>
<br>
Mayt knew instantly it was an orc. Judging by its size, he guessed it was a centurion. By its speed, he figured it would be on his daughter in seconds. Years of deadly battle had honed his mental reflexes to a keen edge, and he was casting before the orc had taken two steps toward Maella. The orc had only made it halfway down the hill before green swirling ropes of magic entwined around it, immobilizing it instantly.<br>
<br>
“Maella!” Mayt shouted. “Come here, now!” He tried to keep his voice calm so that he didn’t upset his daughter, but his heart was racing and he felt himself in the grip of fierce panic. Maella turned and ran toward her father, laughing as she ran, completely unaware of the danger posed by the orc, now snarling halfway down the hill as it struggled against its magical bonds. Mayt calmed himself and allowed the magical energies boiling inside him to come forth, channeling the power through his hands. The orc was struck by intense cold, killing it instantly. It fell to the soft grass of the hill with a muted thump.<br>
<br>
Mayt held out his arms as Maella ran to him, engulfing her in a strong hug. He released her and stepped back, looking her sternly in the eye. “Sweetie, please do not run off like that. You scared me.” <br>
<br>
She looked up at him, her large eyes filled with laughter. “OK Daddy. I’m sorry.”<br>
<br>
He hugged her again and said, “I think its almost time for us to go home dear.”<br>
<br>
She frowned “But I don’t want to go home yet!” She said, pleadingly.<br>
<br>
“What if I promise to bring you back soon?” he asked. “Would that be good?”<br>
<br>
She nodded and then her face lit up with excitement. “Grandpa said I could have whatever I wanted for supper tonight,” she said proudly.<br>
<br>
“Did he?” Mayt asked, his voice filled with enthusiasm. “You are a very lucky young girl!” Maella beamed proudly as her father took her hand in his. “This way sweetie,” he said. “The zone to Greater Faydark is in this direction.” They began walking, hand in hand toward the North and had been underway for some time before Maella tugged at Mayt’s hand.<br>
<br>
“Daddy?” she began. “Why are there zones?”<br>
<br>
Mayt stopped walking and turned to his daughter. “Why are there zones?” he said rhetorically. “Well, I suppose that is a question that is a bit difficult to answer, Maella.”<br>
<br>
“Why is it difficult?” Maella asked.<br>
<br>
Mayt chuckled. “Because it involves a very long story about a time long, long ago.”<br>
<br>
“That doesn’t sound too hard.” She asked again.<br>
<br>
Mayt laughed and shook his head. “Sometimes complex things do not have simple answers sweetie.”<br>
<br>
“Mommy says I’m smart,” she beamed, “so I’ll understand.”<br>
<br>
Mayt sighed knowing fully that this question would not go away easily. He turned and continued walking toward Greater Faydark, his daughter’s hand in his. “Let me see, Maella. Where do I start?” He took a deep breath and organized his thoughts.<br>
<br>
“A very long time ago, long before you, or me or your mommy were born, there were many people who were fighting each other.” Mayt said.<br>
<br>
“Why were they fighting Daddy?” Maella asked.<br>
<br>
Mayt sighed. “Because they were angry with each other dear. Even though they were very smart people, they could not get along with each other. And thus, they fought among themselves all the time.”<br>
<br>
“You mean like the Crushbunny Orcs?” the little girl offered.<br>
<br>
“Yes dear, very much like that. The Crushbone orcs and our people can not get along, no matter how they tried.”<br>
<br>
“Uncle Vaal says the Orcs are mean and nasty,” she said with a sour expression. Mayt nodded in agreement.<br>
<br>
“Yes, dear, they tend to be nasty creatures. It is unfortunate.”<br>
<br>
“Is that why do we have zones then?” She asked. “Because of the orcs?”<br>
<br>
Mayt frowned. “Well, all these people who could not get along and fought all the time, started to expect the other people to attack them at any time, much like how the Fier’Dal are constantly fighting with the Crushbone Orcs.” He looked at Maella to see if she was following his story. She seemed rapt with his explanation, and was staring straight ahead, deep in concentration, so Mayt continued. “And so, these people who could not get along were afraid of each other, and wanted to make Norrath safe, as long as they could still fight.”<br>
<br>
Maella turned to her father and said, “Wouldn’t they be safer if they just stopped fighting and made friends Daddy?”<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled at his daughter, marveling at the simplicity of a child’s point of view. “You are absolutely correct, Maella, but unfortunately people are not always as smart as young girls.” Maella shook her head in disappointment and he stopped to kiss the top of her head lightly. “I wish people were as smart as all little girls, Maella, I really do,” he said wistfully.<br>
<br>
They continued walking and moments later Mayt continued. “Well, all those people wanted to protect themselves from everyone else, so a bunch of their leaders came together to discuss a way to make them all safer. They talked, and talked, and talked and talked, but they could not agree on any way they could stop each other from attacking unless it hurt their ability to defend themselves. They argued and argued until finally one very smart wizard suggested a plan that everyone agreed on.”<br>
<br>
“Was it you Daddy? Were you the wizard?” She asked excitedly, her eyes twinkling up at him. Mayt smiled down at her.<br>
<br>
“No sweetie, it was long before I was even born. It was before Grandpa was born even.”<br>
<br>
Maella nodded firmly “Grandpa is old,” she said confidently.<br>
<br>
Mayt laughed. “Yes dear, he is old.” He laughed again. “But this was a long, long, long time before Grandpa was born.”<br>
<br>
“Oh. Then it wasn’t you?”<br>
<br>
“No dear, it wasn’t”<br>
<br>
“If you were alive then, you would have told them what to do, right Daddy?” She smiled at her father, pride in her voice.<br>
<br>
“I think I would have just tried to get everyone to get along Maella. I do not think I would have suggested making zones to save everyone.”<br>
<br>
“Did the smart wizard make the zones?”<br>
<br>
“It was his idea, yes” he answered. Maella nodded. “He suggested that if the world was separated by magical barriers that were difficult to cross, then an army could not sneak up on anybody easily. So, they divided the world into many zones and put magical barriers around them.” He paused again to see if she was understanding him. She was quiet with concentration. “And when they made the barriers, they made them with powerful magic. Wizards from all over Norrath came together to make the barriers, and they worked on them for many years. But magic is a fickle energy, and they found that …”<br>
<br>
“Daddy, what does feckle mean?” she interrupted.<br>
<br>
“Sorry sweetie. It means funny, or strange,” he explained.<br>
<br>
“Oh, OK.”<br>
<br>
“And because magic is funny, they soon found that the zone barriers affected different people differently.”<br>
<br>
“Is that why I feel funny when we zone?” she asked, putting a hand to her stomach.<br>
<br>
“Yes sweetheart, it is. Some people can travel across zones easily, and others have difficulty. Sometimes people get dizzy and pass out when they go through them.”<br>
<br>
“Like you Daddy!” she said happily.<br>
<br>
“Well, yes, I suppose I sometimes do pass out when I am going…”<br>
<br>
“Uncle Solis says that you have a tumor because of zones.”<br>
<br>
Mayt rolled his eyes and shook his head. “I do not have a tumor dear.” He looked at her sternly. “What have I told you about Uncle Solis?”<br>
<br>
Maella put her head down and sighed. “That he’s a doggie, and doggies don’t always make sense.”<br>
<br>
“Good girl,” he said proudly as he squeezed her shoulder lightly. “And I do not have a tumor, but I do pass out sometimes when I am crossing the zone barriers, but not all the time. It probably has something to do with how often I use my magical powers.”<br>
<br>
“But why do we disappear when we go through the barriers?” she asked, puzzled.<br>
<br>
“The barriers actually take us to a different place that is not in Norrath. That is how the barriers slow us down; they transport us to another place, and it takes time to go to that place and come back from it.”<br>
<br>
They walked along silently, hand in hand, until they were nearing Greater Faydark.<br>
<br>
“And speaking of zones,” he said, “here we are dear, the entrance to Greater Faydark.” He looked down at Maella, who had been silent for a long time. She seemed to be struggling with something; her face was drawn into a serious mask. “Is something wrong sweetie?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Daddy?”<br>
<br>
“Yes dear?”<br>
<br>
“Why can’t people just get along? Why do they have to fight, and kill each other, and make zones and things?” She looked up at her father, her big blue eyes innocent and pure.<br>
<br>
Mayt looked back at her, but had to turn away quickly.<br>
<br>
“I wish I knew that Maella. I really wish I knew.”<br>
