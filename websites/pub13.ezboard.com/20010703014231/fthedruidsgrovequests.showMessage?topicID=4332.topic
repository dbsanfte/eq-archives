This is a nice item to have (AC 2 +10 WIS +15 HP +2 vs. Fire/cold/magic and +5 vs. poison/disease - no drop of course), an I would like to get one, but there is no way that any guild on my server will go to the Plane of Mischief (although I could be mistaken) - is there another way around it that anyone knows of?  <br>

The quest starts with Shamus Aghilsews at the building where you go to PoG.<br>
Say to him &quot;I pledge friendship&quot;<br>
He will give you the quest of getting 4 picks from Kromrif Laborers. <br>
Give him the picks, you gain exp (I got a pixel of blue /cheer) and +Tunarean Court faction.<br>
He will then give you a 6 slot container, so keep your Gen Inv slot open for it. You must now get the 6 crests and combine them in the box.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Wood Nymph<br>
Easy, takes time.<br>
Eysa Florahand in the Wakening Land wants you to collect 8 seeds for her to show that you are a friend of the Tunarean Court. These seeds come from Kunark, Antonica, Faydwer, and Odus. She gives you an 8 slot seed pack to fill and combine. The seeds are:<br>
Misty Acorn (On ground in Misty Thicket)<br>
Emerald Orange (Forage in Trakanon's Teeth)<br>
Bag of Caynar Nuts (Forage in Tox Forest)<br>
Vineclinger Berries (Forage in BB Mountains, NO DROP)<br>
Ripened Heartfruit (GFay, Woot, For two quests! GREAT! =D)<br>
Rathe Berries (Foraged in Lake Rathe)<br>
Marr Cherries (Foraged in Ocean of Tears, common in my experience.)<br>
Flarefire Seeds (Foraged in Field of Bone, NO DROP)<br>
Put all 8 in the container and hit combine, give the item you recieve to Eysa, she will give you the Crest of the Wood Nymphs.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Unicorn<br>
HARDEST, Bottleneck of this quest.<br>
After some talking to NPC's in WL and PoG Prince Thirneg tells you to cure Lithiniath in PoM. The only way of this is 'death and rebirth into a lawful vessel.'<br>
Kill Lithiniath in PoM. He drops a horn. On the other side of his room is a white stallion. Give him the horn and he will transform into the real Lithiniath. He will give you the crest of the Unicorn.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Fauns<br>
Medium-Hard<br>
Shamus gives this quest. Kill a storm giant architect and loot the kromzek architect blueprints. Give them to Shamus Aghilsews. He says &quot;You have my gratitude Feltrak. With these blueprints we can better prepare the forests defenses against the giant invaders. I have yet another favor to ask of you as well. Fill this empty bag with crystallized sulfur. When mixed with the crushed herbs in the other bag it will create an explosion strong enough to destroy stone. Take the two full bags into Kael Drakkel and plant it into a crate of the kromzek's building supplies.<br>
Receive 4 slot container<br>
Receive 'bag of crushed herbs'<br>
Place 1 crystallized sulfur into each slot of the bag. Combine. It becomes a bag of sulfur. Go into Kael from wakening. Head up past the first few guards and go up a hill, you see 4 destroyed buildings. There will be 2 bags on the floor of one of the buildings. Click here and it will open up a trade window, and your invis pops. Quickly put your bag of sulfur and bag of crushed herbs in the trade window and hit trade. This will cause an explosion. A bag will be on the ground now, PICK IT UP. If you don't you will need to start the quest over. Before you do this buff up your fire resist and HP. The explosion will do around 1000 points of damage, and giant wanderers are in agro range, so you may die, just be sure to get the bag off the ground. <br>
Give the pile of rubble that you got off the ground to Shamus<br>
Receive crest of the fauns.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Faery Dragons. <br>
Easy<br>
Find Lord Gossimerwind and hail him. Say &quot;I wish to assist&quot;<br>
He will give you the quest. Kill the Kromzek Foreman and loot his helmet and bring it back for the Crest of the Faery Dragons.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Sifaye<br>
Easy<br>
Find Countess Silveana in WL. Ask her, 'what giants' She wnats you to retrieve the 'stick that he carries' referring to the Storm Giant Surveyor. Kill him and loot his surveyor scope. Give it to her. Receive Crest of the Sifaye.<br>
<br>
Crest of the Drixie<br>
Easy<br>
Find Lord Prismwing in WL. Say &quot;I am a friend of the court&quot; He will ask you to find out what happened to one of his heralds that went to cobalt scar to deliver a message to the othmir. I later found out he suffered the same fate as my first trip to CS =D <br>
Kill Yvolcarn in Cobalt Scar. On my server he is often up. If he isn't then kill the wyvern spawns anywhere in the zone, they are all PH's for him. He is not easy to kill and can be solo'd by a druid. I solo'd him once and it was a very close fight. He is level 52 and summons. He is a warrior type so no casting. He hits pretty hard, 150-160 if I remember right. (NOT RECOMMENDED: To solo, keep him sunbeamed and have egress up. Use snare/nukes. Don't Dot as that will make him summon more often (once each tick)Much easier if you get a high level shaman to help and just nuke him to death.) He drops Drixie remains. I've seen it once where he didn't have them, but I've killed him several times and it seems they are common on him. <br>
Give the 'drixie remains' back to Prismwing.<br>
Receive crest of the drixie.<br>
<br>
Like I said, easy quest, GREAT reward, the only bottleneck is the PoM part. People aren't going to PoM as often now that they disabled the faction bug where you could start running and /q and run past all the dragons that would normally eat you. Now it looks to me a necro can get there and FD at the safe spot, then a monk can pull a mage's corpse to the safe spot, and the necro can res the mage and begin CoH'ing a raid in. Next, you'll have to either make a mad dash for the portal and accept the fact that 1/2 people will die, or you can clear the rest of the way. I beleive from the safe spot you need to kill 5 dragons to get there, 1 fight will be a 2 dragon fight in close quarters, and they aren't easy dragons =D<br>
Was told that the spawn time on Lithiniath is about 6 hours, so if you are going to bring a raid in there make sure you bring at least 2 druid/rangers that need this great quest item. <br>

<br>
As for druids, by the time most druids now would be able to get this item, they would have little need for wisdom, and most would go with a higher AC, higher HP ring.  I consider the 8th or 9th step coldain ring, for example, to be greatly superior to this one.<br>
<br>
For a mid-level druid, I agree that the +10 wisdom is great.  And this ring would probably be suitable for the difficulty of the quest without the Mischief trip.  When you consider the difficulty of the latter, however, the ring is underpowered.  It ought to have AC 8 to 10, with +8 to 10 to all resists, to accompany the +10 wisdom. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/16/01 9:35:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Kalinn?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tunarean Signet Ring</span><hr size=1> this ring is really rare.  im pretty sure there is only one on karana right now.  often, an items value is in direct proportion to the number of them in existence =)<br>
<br>
as for whether this ring is a good one or not, of course it is =)  the ac is a bit underpowered considering the difficulty of completing the quest, yes.  but any time you can add a high wis item, and face it, 10 wis on a ring is godly, it allows you to drop 2-3 lower wis items elsewhere and replace them with ac and resists.  this ring not only fulfills the high wis requirement, it also provides good resists, especially to the often neglected poi/dis.<br>
<br>
there are a lot of druids capable of getting to PoM that would really benefit from this ring.  not every guild going to PoM is full of lvl 60s completely decked =)  and even by lvl 60, sometimes there are so many druids you are competing with for armor, you arent anywhere near decked. <p>-K<br><br>

When I made Lea I knew squat about this game and she has a whopping starting WIS of 90 - yay (yeah, I put points into STR /bonk me - go figure!).  I am ALWAYS looking for WIS items, that way I can replace some of the wis crap I have for non-wis items.  This item would be a nice one to have.<br>
<br>
Hehe - if you're starting WIS is in the 110 range, I agree - at level 56 this is not an issue.  However, for me, it is always an issue.  I am hoping to relieve some of that once I get my epic.  Hopefully then I can start replacing some stuff =)<br>
<br>
The quest itself seems doable - but honestly, at this point, I am not sure that I can convince anyone to go throught the hell that you have to go through to get to PoM, when that plane is not even itemized yet =(  So far, all I got was a good laugh from people, hehe - can't say that I blame 'em =)<br>

<br>
This formula holds true only up to a point.  What happens when your best items have top AC AND wisdom, and you have 210 or so wisdom even with head, boots (my GEBs finally got replaced by verm boots) rings and earrings with NO wisdom at all, etc.   In other words, when the RING slot is the one best suited for gaining AC, HP and resists.  A lot of druids at 59 and 60 in the larger guilds (the druids most likely to be able to get this ring, thanks to the Mischief trip) are in this position.  Even human druids.<br>
<br>
Now, granted, not all 59 and 60 level druids are going to have maximized their wisdom (or close).  For wisdom limited druids, this ring definitely is a good thing.  And it would be entirely suitable if the quest left out the Mischief trip.  But with the Mischief portion, my comments above stand.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthaylin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaylin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/17/01 1:51:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tunarean Signet Ring</span><hr size=1> You left out one druid in your comment, even human druids, half elfs, they start out with only 95 wis mx, this item would be awsome, if not only just for the wis and saves for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/17/01 2:17:03 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Kalinn?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tunarean Signet Ring</span><hr size=1> you have to look at all the combinations available to you with your gear, then determine which is better.  for instance, you could wear GEBS and a velium fire ring, for a total of 11 ac, 9 int, 9 wis, 65 hp.  or you could wear diamond wedding band and withered boots for 7 ac, dex 11, int 5, wis 8, hp 40, mana 20, svp 10, svc 8, svf 8.  or go for tunarean signet ring and shimmering terror hide boots for 12 ac, 4 str, 4 dex, 4 agi, 10 wis, 10 cha, 15 hp, 5 svf, 5 svc, 5 svm, 5 svp, 5svd.  all three combos provide an equivalent of 9-10 wis, but the accompanying stats vary greatly.  your finances also affect your choices in gear, and interestingly enough, the best of these combinations, the third, is also the cheapest =)<br>
<br>
i myself have very few items i wear for wis.  only my cloak, shield, one ring, weapon, and bracers are for the wis, and they all have between 9 and 20 wis.  those 6 items alone give me 187 wis, and open up all my other slots for ac and resist based gear(cept my crystal chitin BP which is my one vain point =P).  i have a few other items with low wis that are worn for their other stats, such as the ac and resists on obulus shroud, hp and svd on withered boots, and ac on kromrif leggings.  they bump my wis up to 215, or 223 if i wear my vermi tunic.  its also incredibly nice to maintain a 200+ wis when swapped to full resist gear.  im not dependant upon enchanter buffs during raids to maintain my mana pool, and that makes life much easier.<br>
<br>
and interesting to note, when my guild hit PoM, we had 4 druids there.  2 lvl 52s, a 57, and a 58 (if im remembering correctly).  im not sure what we will see in the future for what it takes to get to PoM, but certainly, the attempts done in the past werent limiting in any way beyond being high enough level just to zone in.  technically, a horde of lvl 1's could have gotten in, if the zone allowed it. <p>-K<br><br>

<br>
Kalinn, you are still missing my point.  I agree that until you reach the higher levels, the type of balancing you suggest is what should be done.  Hell, I was advocating just this sort of balancing over a year and a half ago on these forums.<br>
<br>
My point is that, unless you are a wisdom-limited druid (and half-elves are, by definition, wisdom-limited...:P ), you don't need the 9 to 10 wisdom AT ALL from any of your combinations.  Instead, you will have so much wisdom that you just don't worry about it for those slots, and go for the best AC, HP and resist combinations down the line.  <br>
<br>
The reason we can forget about wisdom when we reach this point is because of all of the relatively accessible high level wisdom items available to us now.  We (by which I mean high level druids in raid-capable guilds, who are also the ones who will be the ones able to obtain this ring) can get to 220/225 wisdom pretty easily without any jewelry whatsoever (i.e., rings, earrings, necklace).<br>
<br>
A specific example.  I had 219 wisdom with GEBS and no wisdom jewelry or shield.  I dropped my GEBs (9 wisdom) for my Vermiculated Boots (better AC and HP).  The 9 wisdom on the boots was worthless to me, and there was nothing particularly better to swap on any other slot except, perhaps, my face (I have the Bone Mask with 4 wisdom right now, which replaced my Polished Mithril Mask a month ago;  I'm hoping to get the Eyepatch of Plundering with no wisdom as an upgrade soon, which will drop me to 206 wisdom).<br>
<br>
My rings?  8th stage Coldain (8 AC/MR/Str, with 8 pt DS), and the velium fire wedding ring (6 AC, 65 hp).  I would be a fool to swap out either of these for this Tunarean ring.  If I need resists, I'd wear the +8 to all saves velium diamond ring.  The resists on this ring, in contrast, are pretty pitiful.)<br>
<br>
Now, if PoM becomes doable by level 46-55 druids, then the ring becomes a nice mid-range general upgrade.  As conceded above, it is an excellent ring for high-level wisdom-limited druids.  But for many of us, the 10 wisdom is relatively worthless.  I'd trade the 10 wisdom for 10 AC or +10 to all saves any day.  (+10 to all saves would be very nice, but not out of line....remember we already have the player crafted +8 to all saves ring already available).<br>

I use vel diamond rings for saves. I have 193 wisdom and when I buff with bladecoat and natureskin I go up to 800 ac. My CR/FR are 90 and my MR is 60. Now, Feltrak was my first character, and YES I DID put 10 points into stamina because that's what the *strategy* guide said. I think I only put 5 points into wisdom. When you tell me I don't need this 10 wis 10 CHA (something you ALL have forgotten about) and +saves ring, it angers me. Sorry, I'm not in an uber guild. My epic weapon was the greatest achievement of my druid life. I have no ph4t drag0n l3wtz. I don't wear any velious armor. Sirocco, I don't know your class/level but it sounds to me that you are in an uber guild and have many resources available to you. I have done my best to put greed aside and get all the best armor I can. Hell, it was my turn to loot a vermi bp and I let a level 60 druid loot it before me, so he could finally be finished with fear. You seem like you have every armor of every type, and '10 wis doesn't matter' is something any non uber guildie druid would drool about. <br>
<br>
Now to my second point. Why doesn't anyone care about Charisma? With my Cha gear I can get up to 130-140. When soloing in fear this was essential, as charming a shiverback could stick for a long time, allowing you to kill 4-5 mobs. And for a 2 group fear crack I always had 1 druid in each group, so they kept a pet up the whole time and it was one less mob to kill for crack. No more soloing in fear though, Verant added 2 scareling 1 shiverback and 1 glare lord roamers to the north wall /rude verant<br>

Trust me based on the RISK involved, this ring is pure and simply put, *CRAP*.<br>
<br>
I'm a Half Elf Druid, I have decent gear, I'm wearing a Cured Tizmak Tunic =) and run around with 204 Wisdom and 830 ac. Rings I wear are a Diamond Wedding Band and a Velium Fire Opal ring.<br>

If you aren't in an &quot;uber guild&quot; or &quot;raid guild&quot; where you can get &quot;phat dragon lewtz,&quot;  at this point you have little hope of going to PoM and getting this ring.  Re-read my points above, carefully.<br>
<br>
Feltrak, at 58 with your obvious capabilities (full verm and the druid epic?), you should easily be above 200 wisdom already.  From your description, it's easy to see what's holding you back: the full vermiculated.  <br>
<br>
You can upgrade from this stuff pretty easily either solo or with a single group of 6 friends.  And if you want some of the really nice stuff, like the Othmir Prexus Totem (18 wis), it's pretty easy for a modest sized guild to get with 18 folks.  Nothing really uber about it.<br>
<br>
I'm not in what you would call an uber guild.  We have 30 to 40 active members, and are planes and raid capable.  We pride ourselves on going after mobs with 50% to 75% of the folks that some of the other guilds require.  I have some nice equipment, but I am still missing several nice truly uber items (e.g., my neckpiece is the soloable SoV quest, not a NOS or WW dragon drop).  A lot of my stuff came from soloing or small group actions.  I just have done my research and also haven't ever gotten distracted by twinking.  When you play one character for two years, the debris/loot adds up after awhile.<br>

<br>
That said, I agree, I took one look at this ring and said no thanks - there are better ways to get wisdom than the ring slot.<br>
<br>
Now, I will admit, my gear is somewhat uber as I wear a fungi tunic and still maintain 200 wisdom, but there is enough gear out there with good wisdom on it to allow you to not take it in the ring slot.<br>

I'm on Norrath.  <br>
<br>
K'Dar is relatively easy for a dragon.  First, his presence is simple to detect for a druid.  You gate to the zone, run for less than a minute, and you know if he's up.<br>
<br>
Second, gathering folks for the kill is easy.  Just gate them all to CS (invis 'em beforehand if KOS), then head down to the far end of the beach.  A short range pull and the battle is on.<br>
<br>
Third, K'Dar, as dragons go, is pretty easy.  With 18 people (3 groups), any moderate sized raid-capable guild can take him down without problems.<br>
<br>
If you don't think of the above as a relatively easy dragon raid, obtaining the +10 wisdom ring is so far beyond your capabilities at this point it's pointless to discuss. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utrevize.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trevize</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://eq.guildmagic.com/pics/8063.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/18/01 1:19:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: reply</span><hr size=1> Some of you peeps should create a charactor where Scirocco plays and inspect him sometime.  =P <br>

Sheesh give the guy a break.<br>

He's not in an uber guild.  He's in a *very good* guild however.  IMO Scirocco rocks and does damn good research and makes very good stragic decisions about his equiptment and he gets to hang out with Uzzu (doh! did I say that.. err nm)  I'm also very glad he puts up with my /tells :-)   He's probably one of the best equipted druids I ever seen and again he's not in an uber guild!  Whenever I see him I love inspecting him.  He seems to beat &quot;the&quot; uberguild on the server quite often to the good druid quests.  Then I wait expentantly for Scirocco's post on the quest then go follow his footsteps :-).<br>
<br>
BTW Scirocco lets get a group and go get you a damn NoS already.   Plus let me know when you have time for the glove thing we were talking about the other day.  :-)<br>

As for gloves, I've been looking for my &quot;supplier&quot; to be online, but haven't seen him since we spoke.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A> at: 4/20/01 8:58:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleandrasilvertongue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leandra Silvertongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/26/01 9:50:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ROFL</span><hr size=1> Hehe - so back to my original question, is this quest really possible? I mean, in all honesty, I doubt that even Uber guilds are going to attempt to make the trek to PoM for a plane that is not even itemized yet!!<br>
<br>
It's my understanding, that just getting to PoM is close to impossible.  There is a corridor with level 70 dragon mobs that are KoS to everything regardless of faction. So, IF you make it through there, you get to PoM to fight mobs that drop nothing and have random HP. <br>
<br>
The only successful strategy of making it to PoM that I have heard of, is using a rez stick.  Basically, the raid group dies on the way up, and a rogue, with the right faction (not sure what that faction is) can invis and drag bodies through that corridor (not sure how this works with the new dragging rules with bad faction).  Once there, the rogue uses the rez stick to rez the cleric who then rezzes everyone else.  <br>
<br>
Now, I am not sure about anyone else, but if I even suggested to my guild that I wanted to try this, I would probably get laughed at, hehe.  Has anyone heard of any other good strategy plans for getting to PoM or any alternatives for completing this quest? Thanks =)<br>

You had 3 seconds to get a direction and hit /q. But now that they fixed the velious faction bug thing that made them delay before killing you, you can't stay alive long enough to get the direction and hit /q. <br>
Strategy 2: Just like a fear crack. This however, requires more luck. The easiest way , if you have smart people, is to have each try to run as far as they can toward PoM. Let them die. Get a necro and have him run for the 'safe spot.' If he is skilled and gets some luck with him, he can FD there and /q. May take a few tries. Necro logs to an alt. Now is the monks and rogue's turns. They both pull all the corpses that didn't make it far enough, to the safe spot. Necro res's an epic cleric, and the epic cleric starts the resing, but make sure they aren't pulling more corpses here =D Res everyone in, then the hard part is next. (Yep, that was the easy part) The raid must now kill a few dragons, one fight including two dragons at once. These are level 60 dragons I believe but one CH's and the other is like Wuoshi. Kill these 2 and a level 65 (I think) dragon and you can safely go to PoM. As you may have realized, you have to get a raid to do it. BUT, you could try running 2 groups there, and pray that at least 1 cleric makes it in, and have a necro summon the other's corpses. If you get a few people in there, the unicorn would be cake.<br>
