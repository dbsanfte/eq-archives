<br>
Az and everyone else, I'm all for &quot;to each his own&quot;, I think you guys are arguing apples and oranges.  It comes down to your goals.  If your goal is to get to level 60 as quickly as possible, then taking time away from normal exp to get AAs is not going to help you reach that goal.<br>
<br>
If you value those AAs more than the levels, or for whatever reason think they'll help you more than levels will, then more power to you.<br>
<br>
I think when they designed the AA system they intended it to offer people different paths.  <br>
<br>
If your goal is to do better against Naggy and Vox raids you could probably up your fire/cold/magic resists by 10 points each.  For YOU, that might be worth doing at level 52.<br>
<br>
If your guildmates/friends are all leveling slowly compared to you and you want to keep in pace with them, racking up AA points might help you do that without halting your character advancement.  For YOU, maybe that's a good idea.<br>
<br>
If you are in a high end raiding guild or trying to get there, levels are probably better than any AA you can get.  For YOU, AA probably won't make sense until level 60.<br>
<br>
This one path for all stuff is getting kind of tiring to read. <p><BR>

I mean whats it all about ?</span><hr size=1> Well I have to say that I don't buy it. Perhaps you are better at getting AA skills at 57 than many people are at 60. How much faster would you be at 60?<br>
<br>
I did a couple of blues of AA at 52 when I read about the effect of Innate Run Speed. Not surprisingly, that AA bar moved at almost the same rate as my regular experience bar when i put either toward 100%. At 56, the AA bar flies.<br>
<br>
Here's the problem - you are making an argument based on personal experience (without rigorous testing, from what I can see). Your personal experience doesn't jijbe with either mathematical truth or logic.<br>
<br>
Maybe it will help if you can tell me that one of these premises is wrong:<br>
<br>
1. It takes the same number of experience points of AA to get one point no matter your level.<br>
2. A dark blue mob will yield the same experience to two people of different levels.<br>
3. A higher level person will kill a dark blue mob significantly faster than the lower level person, assuming the same equipment.<br>
4. There are frequent occasions when a person will kill the same mobs for multiple levels.<br>
<br>
If those are true, then it is, of a certainty, true that a higher level person will collect AA significantly faster than a lower level person.<br>
<br>
The issue is of degree. Is someone crazy for doing AA before 59 or 60? No, not even if they want to be effecient as a goal. They are being less effecient than the person who is going nearly pure levelling. Unless one of my premises up there is wrong, that's a deductive argument. Where it might become inductive if you could really make a case that you can &quot;catch up&quot; to the effeciency of a pure leveller by use of AA skills.<br>
<br>
Also, part of the issue is that you seem (from a post in the equipment check forum) to have access to some good equipment for soloing AND you are providing arguments as to why you are a better soloer.<br>
<br>
The direction I'm coming from is of a paladin who is intending to group - thus my original of argument of comparing a mid-50 paladin with many AA points to a 60 paladin with 3. There's just no way a mid-level with many AA is as much of an asset to a group as a 59 or 60 paladin.<br>

I mean whats it all about ?</span><hr size=1> i posted my numbers on dark blue con kills that it took to get an AA orange versus a real exp orange in 55, and the light blue con numbers to get an aa orange, and to get a little over 2 blues of real exp (I got too tired of killing light blues and greens to get a full orange in 55 that way for the testing purposes). This isn't just "personal experience without rigorous testing". I posted numbers awhile ago back in april on this board. Those tests were the reason I am positive that light blue cons give you more exp in AA than they should (I postulate due to the exp mod issues that affected hybrids in january, where they fixed it, I think we are getting one percent decrease rather than two for light blues (one to make up for class mod and one to make up for light blue con). Hell, I can get an aa orange in one and a half hours of low light blue cons in SD floor when I am waiting for the plateau to clear, and that should NOT be happening.<br>
<br>
I am only in SD right now because I am sick of guk. I have 120 days played and most of those were in guk (I am not exagerating to say 80-90 days played in lguk). The exp is better there than SD, but SD is gerenally no waiting. However, I have been back to lguk a few times to get som AA exp. It takes me 15 minutes to get an aa blue. That's it. The only problem is lack of mobs due to overcrowding. I pop in there late at night and I can get a full AA in a 6 hour block.<br>
<br>
The statement:<br>
<br>
"Your personal experience doesn't jijbe with either mathematical truth or logic."<br>
<br>
Is utter BS. Play in an efficient zone rather than inefficient one (a la Chardok that you continuously mention as where you exp) and you too can get exp at a much faster rate. Those numbers of 6-8 hours for an AA point were from when I was still 55 and was trying to get "sir" at the end of my AA exp run. I was using an AP for my weapon, 21 percent haste, VoM/IoN, and had ac around 1050. I cleared all the mobs from lord room (if a lord ph was up, I would also pull the two on either side, I didn't like killing lord as he took too long for crap loot) down to and including magus and back towards safehall and sometimes the hand room. Solo. That was ~15 mobs per 30 minutes, and around 2/3 were dark blue at 55. That was how I did exp that fast.<br>
<br>
I've gone back there at 56 with much better equipment and owned the place. If it wasn't for having to wait for 2+ hours to get the lord/magus camp, I would still be down there. Please don't basically call me a liar because I haven't posted some sort of parsed evidence of exp gain. (I'm not sure how I would do that, though maybe if I got a camp and kept it from right before I dinged and aa to right after the next ding I could use the log times from the "You have gained 1 ability point" statement from when you ding an aa? I assume that would work?).<br>
<br>
As to your points, #3 is where most of these arguments from level 60s are flawed. Sure, I can kill a FG shroom if its chasing after someone so I can one to kill (can't single pull), and it will eat me alive requiring multiple heals and such, and I will be horribly inefficient compared to a level 60 paladin. So what? At 55 especially (if you want to do aa's before 60 I endorse doing them in 55, perfect level for it before mass con changes to light blue at 56 in most places), I could kill a dar ghoul in less than 2 minutes almost every time. I guarantee you most dark blue exp cons are not killed in less than 2 minutes at level 60.<br>
<br>
As to your final point about grouping versus soloing, that's entirely beside the point. If you want to talk about efficiency, stop grouping. Grouping is a blackhole for exp. I group at every raid I go to. I group when friends want to tackle some mob or when I want to explores some zone where everything is 50+. I do NOT group for exp. Most paladins that have phenomenal rates of aa exp gain are NOT grouping either, they have a two-boxed character *ungrouped* doing damage and healing/buffing for no experience.<br>
<br>
I'll say again, level 60 is the most efficient way to power. If you want to join uber guild X and raid 5 times a week all night, then get 60 asap and then get the prerequ aa's the guild requires. But when someone asks, "should I spend my aa point at level 55 on X or Y?" don't make it out as if they are being a dumbass for having gotten that point (and just look at older threads to see just that attitude and specific statements to that fact).<br>

However it's very widely supported that lvl 60s have innate advantages to them that far outweigh most benefits of AAs.  Getting AAs may have worked fine for some people prior to 60, but for the majority of people, they will find more benefit AND more desireability as a group member by being lvl 60.<br>

SU = uber<br>
<br>
Anyone who says &quot;don't get slay undead you wont use it much&quot; is less then enlightened.<br>
<br>
Break down the math for a minute , if you have any desire to be uber or already are then the first thing you want is SU3. It's a massive pain in the arse getting there but once you have SU then you should be leveling off of strictly undead mobs. SU increases your dmg output which increases your kill rate, the faster you kill the faster you gain AA. Hence once you have SU3 all succesive AA comes faster. I know personally I want pretty much every AA possible, which that is a long way off since the past 2 weeks I was getting my VT key pieces and this week our guild is learning how to kill the Emp. None the less if you are even considering getting a massive amount of AA then you should start with SU.<br>
<br>
My AA are being invested like this....<br>
Run3/Regen3, CF3, SU3, Horse (I hate travel), CA1 ND1 CS1, PE, CA3 ND3 CS3. After that I'll worry about it as I get points since that is more then enough to deal with for now. <br>
