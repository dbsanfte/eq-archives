<hr><b>Continue on with this Unknown Druids Post...</b><br>
<br>
<u>I've concluded</u> druids need Complete Heal and Manaburn.  Uber guilds dont' want us, raids don't need us, and while we have great fun soloing we don't do a whole heck of a lot for anybody else.  CH is broken but unless the game is fixed to not revolve around this spell it's either join in or get out.  Manaburn has it's nice points but mostly this is a "my dic... er nuke is bigger than yours" spell, and is more flash than bang but oh what a pretty flash.<br>
 <br>
  There is a reason uber guilds recruit as many clerics and as many wizards as they can get their hands on and start to turn up their nose or refuse more than 2 druids.  Take a look at any of the top guild rosters and you'll see endless ranks of clerics and growing ranks of wizards and while the shaman / magician / enchanter ranks aren't overwhelming no one questions that they are there and necessary.  Druids however are bench space that everyone else wishes was a cleric or wizard instead.<br>
 <br>
  Druids usually fill the role of healer.  Amazingly with 6 or 8 clerics on a raid (and them chewing rods like mad from the shaman/magician factory) there is still need for druids to heal, even though our 60 heal is less efficient than a level 34 cleric's and by the time a cleric hits 39 they're easily far and away outhealing the 60 druid on the raid.  So obviously there is something wrong here.  Despite the overabundance of clerics, healing is STILL required, so either clerics can't heal well enough so druids have to fill in with their insignificant heals, or druids (and others) don't heal well enough that there must be so many clerics around.  I've stated druids should get CH so you know which one I think it is.  When the very first question when a target is reported up is "how many clerics do we have" and then "how many clerics can people 2box/ditch their primary character and play a cleric instead" and this determining whether or not we get the mob I think it pretty clear that the broken CH and the game's reliance on it is causing problems.  I don't see VI fixing this and as much as I'd prefer a different solution I see druids getting CH as the best thing for the class and the game.<br>
 <br>
  Giving druids CH also kills a 2nd bird with the same stone.  Mid 50's druids are in a very bad situation for healing.  Without a slower in the group they simply cannot keep up healing a group that is getting a decent xp rate without seriously twinked tanks.  Although not a great in-combat heal for druids since we lack low agro pulse heals and divine aura/barriar and plate armor and the extra HPs afforded by armor and symbol so we won't live through casting this often, it would make an excellent downtime heal that would keep the party going instead of staring at the druid waiting for her mana to regen and wondering how soon they can kick her out for that cleric or shaman shouting LFG at the zoneline.<br>
 <br>
  What is manaburn?  Manaburn is a 6 second cast 144 minute refresh class AA that empties the wizard's manapool and converts it into a nuke doing approximatly 2 damage per mana (I believe it's randomly 1.6 to 2.2) that can be critted and works with focus items giving a 7k nuke to your typical wizard and potentially over 24k nuke to an "uber" equipped wizard that gets very lucky.  It is unresistable and has the same agro as dealing a single point of damage (basically no agro.)  It also works in PvP for full or near enough damage that even buffed tanks usually die to it and non warriors have no chance.  Necromancers have a somewhat similar AA called Lifeburn.<br>
 <br>
  Manaburn is... overrated, but despite this is so sought after and drooled over it puts wizards into a heavily desired position.  While great for KSing Ragefire and other "old" mobs (so is Atone and memblur) and good for those very high resist mobs that you can't land anything on otherwise or don't want to be anywhere near their AE (Tunare etc.) it is mostly good for stopping a mob from gating or cutting through enrage.  On mobs with seemingly 500k or more HPs where it takes 10 to 20 minutes of beating on the mob tossing your mana away in a 2.6 damage/mana nuke is pretty dumb when you can use moonfire, wildfire etc. and be doing about 6 damage/mana (more if you're a wizard!)  So while it's not going to infringe on wizards with their bigger manapools, higher manaregen, much higher DPS, more efficient and varied nukes, it will make druids more desired and give us an excuse as to why we can't be in the CH chain...  =)<br>
 <br>
  So as it stands a raid is better off for the most part by adding a 39 cleric than a 60 druid and while druids aren't nearly as far off wizards for effectiveness as we are clerics, we are nowhere close to being as desired as them and lacking unresistable damage still face the occasional raid/fight we can contribute nothing at. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usobesilvertree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sobe Silvertree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/16/02 5:29:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellzii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellzii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/02 7:57:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> There is not enough for a druid to do</span><hr size=1> Top Tier guild reopened recruiting yesterday on my server.

They roughly have 10% DRU slots. The problem on my server in my mind is not that we don't have enough Druid abilities spells whatnot, it's that due to the old skool thinking, everyone has a druid at their disposal.<br>
<br>
Last Poll showed 30% Druids on the server with 13% as mains. What this looks like to me is not that Top Tier guilds have closed the door to druids, but that there are too many of us trying to get those few slots that are available.<br>
<br>
This is further complicated by the druids out there that completely solo'd their way to 60 and are maybe a half a step better than a Ebay'd cleric which gives those few of us Druids who are ready for ther big time a bad rap.<br>

30% druids, what are you on, the woodelf only server?  Spend an hour and hop through all the kunark, velious and luclin zones 1 person in 8 will not be a druid, trust me.  Since I typically see as many shamans as druids and twice as many clerics (more in high level zones) than druids that would make 52% of the server population being those 3 priest class.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrolmn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grolmn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/02 8:26:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: There is not enough for a druid to do</span><hr size=1> I honestly agree that SOMETHING needs to be done for druids for high end raiding.

The numbers came from polls off the server webpage which a good amount of our population reads. We are an old server that has not seen a lot of splits. We have many people who have played when druids were &quot;uber&quot; (we could zone in to Neriak with wolf form yada yada yada) I believe those numbers are fairly accurate. While I can understand the desire for certain upgrades, I do not feel we are the most broken class in EQ. As for being a all ELF server our Druid pop is mostly Halflings and Woodelves with a rare Human or Half Elf, and there are ALOT of players that 2box a portbot.<br>
<br>
I talked with the current recruiting officer (who also frequents these boards) a couple months back while doing the Tunarian Signet Ring Quest (Still broke ARRGH). Discussing the state of druids in the game possibilities of joining a top tier guild (I was officer in a second tier guild at the time). Her comment to me was funny but prolly something I should have considered. Basically it came down to Roll up a new Rogue and PL him to 60 and you would have a better chance of joining a top tier guild the Druid spots are full and no one in them would consider leaving such a cushy spot.<br>

Say, 40 and below (so as to avoid any dispute about declining healing power through the 40s after clerics get CH).<br>
<br>
In these "well balanced" levels, druids maintain a certain percentage of the power possessed by the classes at the top of the charts in certain areas.  In our strong areas, this percentage is in the 65% to 85% range.  This includes DDs, DoTs, and Healing.   We have skills in other areas, of course, like charming, but our relative power is below 50% in most cases.<br>
<br>
The "Druid Problem" is that our relative power in our strong areas has dropped dramatically by the time we reach 60.  This is especially evident in high level raids.  Healing is, perhaps, the most egregious example, but is not the only one.  Moreover, our relative power in our other areas has generally dropped as well (e.g., we were pretty even with wizards with regard to gating/porting, but we now have dropped to 60% or so, in my opinion).<br>
<br>
My logic is this: since we were balanced before at our old power percentages, we will maintain that balance if we maintain those same relative power percentages.<br>
<br>
And that's all I think most druids want.  To maintain their same relative position vis a vis other classes.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, druids cannot get CH and Manaburn as they currently are implemented.  They really establish the 100% power ranking for Clerics and Wizards.  Druids need improvements in both healing and DDs, but only to the point of restoring the class to its proper relative power in these areas.<br>

<br>
Perhaps, in consideration of the other thread going right now, that ability should appear in PoP when druid ports become further watered down.<br>

It's pretty much a toy to play with on 32k kunark mobs.  Or the rare occassion where you can get 12+ wizards to go burn down Sontalek, heh.<br>
<br>
In the long run a wizard does more damage chain casting one of their primary 60 nukes and critting on those nukes then Manaburn does.<br>
<br>
It's not as if wizards can manaburn every 5 minutes, its more like every 2.5 hours.<br>
<br>
Would it be nice to have something similar? Sure, but by no means would it change a thing on druid desireablity.<br>
<br>
CH? - The game has stagnated because of CH to the point that only a CH rotation can keep a main tank a live for a good period of time.  Sorry, their is nothing spectacular about counting and clicking a hotkey.<br>

I don't know about manaburn. I think that's a wizard only type of thing. I think that druids should leave that to the wizards.<br>
<br>
However I think you are spot on with the CH thing. I've been saying it for a long time now. Druids (not shaman) need a CH like spell. In particular I would propose a CH that costs 600 mana. It makes clerics 50% healers instead of 400% better healers which is more balanced IMO.<br>
<br>
The clerics being the greedy sons of ... grrr ... must control self ... will flame the crap out of any suggestion that anyone should get anything like effective healing, but we'll see what happens when the VI  guys finish the priest balancing. <br>
<br>
My money is on druids getting a form of CH. Maybe more maybe less than 600 mana but somewhere around there. <br>
<br>
And the clerics can go stuff it with all of their whining.<br>

<br>
====<br>
<br>
Nuking is optional, healing is not. Clerics have to be a plate class for this very reason. They have to heal even if they know it will get major aggro. A leather class low HP/AC druid with a CH will keep dying in exp groups and raids alike as they cant take a beating like a cleric can. <br>
<br>
Getting a torpor like spell is more likely, since its more in line with a chain class spell and its only 1 jump up in armor class.<br>
<br>
====<br>
<br>
Nuking on the other hand is moving downward toward robe classes. Thats a much easier path but if nukes are made much stronger, wizards would become jealous.<br>
<br>
====<br>
<br>
In my opinion, well rounded classes like druids (heal/nuke/buff)would be most successful with UNIQUE raid utility spells instead of trying to move toward clerics or casters. <br>

<br>
I have yet to see a single GOOD reason why Druids should get Complete Heal.  Am I defensive over this spell?  You better believe that I am.  It's been done MANY times before but I'm going to do it again.<br>
<br>
Why would ANYONE play a Cleric if they could play a Druid with Complete Heal?  It is, quite literally, the ONLY thing we get.  Buffs?  Other classes can buff quite easily and effectively in non-raid situations.  For a Raid situation, bring out a single Cleric who has been PLd to 60 and MGB the entire Raid with Aego and then camp him.  Resses?  Paladins and Necros can Rez as well so this isn't the sole territory of Clerics anymore.  Once again, if the Raid wipes just log on your two PLd Clerics with Epics and res the Raid back in.  The ONLY thing that a Cleric has going for him/her is Complete Heal.<br>
<br>
Druids on Raids?  With the exception of Raid Healing, Druids do fine for healing.  Even on Raids Druids do fine for healing so long as groups are made with Druid vs. Cleric healing in mind.  Now with a CH Chain style mob, you STILL can heal effectively.  We Clerics are COUNTING on you to spam smaller and faster heals on the MA to ensure that our CH Cycle works.  A bit of lag on a Clerics part can kill the MA.  Smaller Heals help to ensure that the next CH has a chance to land.  You're also VITAL for spot healing other people.  I'm in a CH Chain, I am NOT able to heal someone who took 3 hits of Riposte damage.  I'm in a CH Chain, I am NOT able to heal myself after downing 3 mod rods.  If the battle is going ok, you get some decent debuffs to the Mob we're fighting to ensure that Nukes land better.  Then you get to Nuke the mob.  Even if you're not able to land Nukes and DOTS, you're still vital for the Resists and Regen you guys bring to the raid and other buffs (PoTC and PoTG is still the buff of choice for most caster classes).<br>
<br>
Exp Groups?  Many people prefer Druids and Shaman over Clerics for exping.  This is especially true in Velks and Fungus Grove.  Why is this?  Druids can do a LOT more than just heal which isn't even the main part of your job in these type of exp groups.  You get to Nuke, Damage Shield, DOT, Buff/Debuff mobs.  Me, I get to heal once evey 3 minutes with Complete Heal and then go back to reading a book.  You speed things up with damage and downtime reduction.<br>
<br>
I cannot solo.  I cannot do damage.  I cannot port.  Hell, I can't even get exp groups these days.  What I CAN do is Heal.  That is the ONLY thing I can do and I do it well.  Give me any sort of competition in that and I have zero reason to be.  I would LOVE to have Upgrades in some of my other areas but I really don't expect them.  Verant, has to date, viewed Clerics as &quot;done&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; since we have Complete Heal and I can't even hope to receive upgrades.<br>
<br>
Now, Huzurdadi , I have to ask you, who is being greedy by wanting CH and Manaburn?  Thankfully I understand that these desires for CH and MB are the exceptions and not the rule.  There are some Druids who just want it all.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my challange is this.  Give me a SINGLE good reason that Druids should receive Complete Heal.  When you come up with that reason, ask yourself:  Will this Unbalance Druids compared to Clerics?  Will this make Clerics useless?<br>
<br>

<br>
Now ask why Druids cannot get something?<br>
<br>
Have we all become so quiet and meak after years of Druid Hating posts and Druid Nerfs that we are afraid to stand up for ourselves.<br>
<br>
Maybe the reason we all sound like whiners is that we have been asking for things for so long without anything being given.<br>
<br>
We started out being polite and accepting a few nerfs for the good of the game and they politely asked for our then broken root to be looked at. After well over a year of "whining" about our root (how hard would it have been to just look at the then problem?) they did and discovered - hey this root is broken just like the Druids have been whining about for a year.<br>
<br>
If we did not whine who wants to bet that our root would still be broken?<br>
<br>
The petition was well thought out and it was not a whine in any way. It was based on facts and intellegence and was obtained by a large dialog with hundreds of experienced Druids. It was presented properly and was unofficially acknowledged yet months and months later Verant has not acted on it nor have they ever told us they were looking into it other than to say that caster balancing is a long process.<br>
<br>
As I have said before I am holding my breath and hoping Verant surprizes us.<br>
<br>
At a time (almost 60) when I am in the end game and have run up against the issues brought up I will NOT start a new class but I will give up EQ if my one and only class is not fixed. The only thing keeping me in the game now is that I am in a great guild with great people who overlook my shortcomings and allow me to do things I could not do without them.<br>
<br>
For those who do not experience the issues being discussed then I say bravo for you but this does not mean that others are not having serious issues that do not need to be addressed.<br>
