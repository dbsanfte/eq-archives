We all want to be treated like an equal in this community.  Each individual wants to feel as important as the next, and that's what a reservation system attempts to accomplish.<br>
<br>
As you've seen in the last three months, there has been a lot of debate on whether independents, small guilds and large guilds have been treated equally by the current reservation system.  The disagreement we’re seeing in the old system is across the board.  It isn’t limited to one group of players, regardless of what a few individuals might suggest.<br>
<br>
It is my opinion that this discontentment in the system has proven that not everyone feels that they are being treated fairly.  To me, that means the old system, which worked for quite some time, is dated and unable to fulfill the needs of the population of the server as it has matured.  Rather than apply an old system, ill received by a large section of the community, to the newer zones, why don’t we allow a new system to be tested out?  What better time is there to test the waters?<br>
<br>
The honest truth is that most of the players on this server can’t handle a completely FFA environment.  If you’ve ever tried to get 30 people to one spot in under 30 minutes in this game, you’ll know that it isn’t an enjoyable experience, especially when you have to do that everyday.  No one wants that.  What people also don’t want is to be required to check these message boards every time they want a challenge.  <br>
<br>
Look at Gorenaire, Severilous, and Talendor.  No one complains about these mobs.  They are a real challenge to any player on the server and yet, they are killed with none to little regard to who has posted an intention.  It’s incredibly exciting to get 40 people together to kill a dragon once every couple weeks without a list or message board to reference.  <br>
<br>
Even more importantly, no one complains about these mobs being up for longer than they “should”.  Without a list to force players to a certain time for them, they can be killed in a true spontaneous fashion.  You can’t say the same of Vox, Nagafen, Trakanon, Venril, Innoruuk, or Cazic-Thule.  <br>
<br>
Every player I’ve talked to in the game hates camp lists.  But when it comes to ubermobs, it seems some people enjoy the benefits of these same lists.  Why is there a disconnection there?  People move on when a spot is camped in the game.  Why can’t they move on when they find an ubermob absent as well?  The number of mobs in this game that require organization and planning are almost endless.<br>
<br>
Someone in another thread asked what harm would come if we allowed intentions and reservations to continue into the new and old zones.  If we allowed the current spiral of disapproval and distrust in the current system to be applied to the newer zones, most of them largely left empty for a majority of the week, I think we would eventually see an abandonment of the system as a whole.  Too many people, both in small guilds and large, disagree with the effectiveness of the system.  If we allow this disapproval of the system to affect every “challenging” zone or mob in the game, we will see the system collapse.  This isn’t a threat or an act of intimidation.  It is a fear of mine; one that I hope doesn’t come to be true.<br>
<br>
Above all else, we must understand that no one on this server desires to see it degenerate even more.  I understand that some people feel reservations are the only way to treat everyone fairly.  I've heard discussion on why the current system treats larger guilds unfairly so that smaller guilds have a chance to experience everything as well.  I also understand that no one is purposely trying to cripple the rights of others on the server.  In the end, we must all understand that our disagreements are not truely the result of ill-will to each other.  They are simply different perspectives.<br>

<br>
I agree with alot you have to say.<br>
<br>
I have 2 problems.<br>
<br>
1. At least one big guild is already FFA/FCFS so long as they are the ones that get there first, wonder what they'll say if someone does it to them. <br>
/sorry Groul about your FG raid.<br>
<br>
2. Big guilds set the example for the little guilds(monkeys see monkeys do) lil guild thinks &quot;If they can just pop in and kill mob X why the hell am I on a 2 month long list.&quot;<br>
<br>
The whole problem comes down to greed some @******'s are getting very greedy and F****** up the system. Said @******'s have been at this behavior for months and the other big guilds have let them slide because they aren't really interested in what they are hitting. The small guilds are very interested in whats getting farmed out of turn.<br>
<br>
Scheduling can and does work, has for a very long time but it won't when we have people who want to destroy the scheduling system doing the most bitching about the system.<br>
<br>
SR, CS, Darkguard and many other have recommended some changes that are in line with saving the system the lists are too damn long as is on the higher ended mobs this is constructive.(/rave)<br>
<br>
Others have suggested scrapping the system.(/rude) <br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Simple they are a being a bunch of greedy arrogant @******'s.<br>
Congrats your uber(hate this word btw) and want to get more uber thats nice for you and your friends some of us just like playing in our crappy old hand me downs and still hanging in hate an fear. I'll probably hit 60 before I finish my planes armor but you know every raid I go on is as fun as the last sometimes even better why because its friendly no ones competing for the zone everyones helpful. Go FFA and you have to spend a raid watching for the train from raid two now you uber folks may be able to mez the entire zone and all but us common folk like things as is.  <br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that when the split comes the FFA/FCFS crowd does the right thing and gets the hell out of here we don't need you and don't want you.<br>
<br>
I know just a whee bit over the borderline rant but I'm sorry all this FFA talk mostly from the same two guilds is really getting under my skin.<br>

Ganon has never proposed FFA.  Neither have I.  Neither has anyone in Watchers.  I can't think of any other &quot;two guilds&quot; that you could be thinking about.  Wait, ET... but we all know they want FFA right?!<br>

Ganon's entire post was about working together to find something that will work for everyone.<br>
<br>
But what happens?  You start throwing accusations of &quot;They want FFA&quot; around and start flaming left and right.<br>

<br>
Mavrin: While I agree with some of your points, greed is not the only factor. Some people would like the chance at some of these mobs in a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time. A nine month long VS list is not reasonable to most.<br>
<br>
Ganon: I disagree with your assertion that our current system is dated. It happens to work relatively well, even with the over crowding, and much more so then ANY other system I've seen on another server. The drawback to over crowding, is that you can't do much except try to cut out a certain amount of the population, or expand the territory. Neither of which is in our control. The mobs you mentioned as being favorably FFA (Sev, Talendor, and Gorenaire) work for now because the majority of guilds and people CAN'T do them. So yes, from your perspective I can see why you would think that this form of FFA works. However, given time, these dragons will not only be spied out everyday, but will create massive amounts of arguements on this server SPECIFICALLY because they can't be reserved.<br>
<br>
FFA doesn't work, except for the very few who can do it better then the majority. And even then, you will have no end of headaches with people constantly trying to snatch your Mob out from under you; eventually on general principal. That would be appalling.<br>
<br>
The new expansion, Scars of Velios. I agree with you that this is as good a place to test new systems as any, since it is still widely under utilized on this server.<br>

<br>
When people mention FFA they suddenly think about stories they have seen of others getting trained so another guild could move in and kill the mob. This is not what I want and I dont think it will ever come down to this.<br>
<br>
In a fact I totally agree with Ganon, fcfs makes sure the servers resoucess are fully ultilized. Where the reservations does not. I really dont think we are that overcrowded a server yet, but the way we shedule things does not make it better.<br>
<br>
About one week ago I wanted to try the EJ dragon, we went to see if he was up and built together a raid. We could only muster about 28 lvl 55+ that early in the day and we gave it a go. We got him to about 40% and it was great fun but we failed. About 4 hours later Silent redemption came in and avenged our deaths. <br>
<br>
without any problems I was able to try and make a raid for the dragon, without letting the dragon go through a booked cycle where it would have been left up for days the dragon was killed. 3 days later the dragon spawned again and was killed by Legion of Heroes. Next time it spawns I think I wil try and give it another try and im pretty sure if I ask the guilds that are strong enough to do a quick raid on him if they would leave it up for me when he pops im sure they would let me. If I fail the dragon will probably die to another guild a few hours later.<br>

Painting entire guilds with the colors as you see them, is anything but productive.  This server will probably come to a fair and rational resolve of the screwed up system we now have, despite your efforts to hurl us into choas.<br>

The current Calendar was<br>
<br>
A. Made by Delsonora who had never seen the planes/dragons and therefore had no qualms about making them reservable.<br>
<br>
B. Evolved from an intentions board, way back in like Feb 2000 we could just post &quot;SR doing vox on the 10th, sign up here&quot;, the problem was that people grew to think you HAD to respect those.<br>
<br>
C. The Plane Forums were designed for many less people, I promise you that if it was just SR, LoH, and Mufat's independant raids doing planes then you wouldn't have people camping the forums. They weren't designed for this many people, if people have to camp a message board something is wrong and it needs to be fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Very simply, it wasn't designed for this many people, it can not support this many people, under the current system<br>
<br>
1. 1 person can have the same rights as 40 people.<br>
2. You have to post at 12:00:01 am to reserve a plane.<br>
3. You have to wait months on the Dragon lists while a few people go to every raid.<br>
<br>
Mavrin: I don't expect ET to simply ignore the calendar? Why? Because they are not in a position to do so, it wouldn't even need SR/Enshadowed/Watchers to stop their plans, 12 level 51s while ET members are still at work can effectively ruin their plans if they decided to do something like that. Very simply, if they keep ignoring your FG raids, YOU can hit them where it hurts. At about 6 pm pst, run through the FG lair and get Zordak organized for a cleric, and if that is not an option you can kill him in his human form, or run him deep into the lava and keep him hailed so they can not attempt him. <p>nillon<br>

Watchers are some of the best peeps on the server. I can't count how many times I've died and next thing I know I get a &quot;rdy for rez&quot; tell from Atien and didn't even know he was in the area.<br>
<br>
I know at least one monk that got his epic by the intervention of Watchers they just appeared saved the raid and even rezzed people who were inadverdent casualties and a couple of people there thought they were going to KS. (I was one who knew better made 50 plat on it too but thats another story.)<br>
<br>
Now as for mentioning names I didn't. I generally try to not point fingers at a whole guild because its usually a percentage of rotten apples not the whole crop we have our dumb asses too.  <br>

So whom did I name in my post. No one but as long as ya bring it up. <br>

Blah Blah Blah Cry me a F*****g river tough, deal with the schedule as is alot of guilds are top heavy unfortunately they aren't as special as yours. I believe it was Kruunch that said &quot;your guild invites policy is not our problem.&quot; <br>
<br>
Try this take all your people on every raid and have fun and share whatever drops Oh wait sorry not enough goodies to go around its not about fun after all is it. <br>
<br>
LA raids average 42-48 peeps regardless of what we post do we need all of them no we take them anyways why? <br>
a. because its called sharing, remember kindergarten.<br>
b. we take some newbies up so stuff don't go to waste.<br>
c. higher levels should teach lower levels keeps the system flowing and on track.<br>
d. So Fn what loot percentages drop do you want to play or be a loot hungry ass.<br>
<br>
As for ripping me a new one.<br>
<br>
Get off your high horse You are not anyone any more special then anyone else around here and neither am I. I pay 10 bucks a month you pay 10 bucks a month so where do get entitled to rip me a new one for voicing my opinion.<br>
<br>
My posts generally support our server encourage people and defend those who can't or won't defend themselves. <br>
<br>
I don't recall me posting I need to have put twice on any lists because our 40 level 50's can't all go somewhere so lets take off small guilds and indies because we're uber.<br>
<br>
Andadas quote;<br>
&quot;Mavrin. I find your post quite stupid.&quot;<br>
<br>
No you didn't if you did you would of kept your hands away from the keyboard.<br>
<br>
It hit you close to home because you do support FFA/FCFS because at this time few guilds could counter you wait say 5 months if brell doesn't split all the lil guilds getting shit on now going to be packed with level 55+s and going to remember the examples set by players like you and payback as they say is a bitch.<br>
<br>
Now Mavrin grew up with many of the players in Enshadowed and I don't have a problem with them being in your guild I do have a problem with your attitude about what you are entitled too by right of might.<br>
<br>
One last thing;<br>
<br>
&quot;But wait... I know... because Ganon said something about compromise instead of abusing our current system you got upset right?&quot;<br>
<br>
What are you smoking because I feel left out?<br>
Find one post or statement by me not supporting the system as is and improving it. I'll do the same for you lets see who finds some posts.<br>
<br>
FFA/FCFS is for people who want shit for themselves calling it anything else is still shit just in a different wrapper.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I pissed you off, you had it coming and I feel much better now.<br>
<br>
Have a fine Brell day.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Whiney bitch.<br>
<br>
Nillon: I agree with you that the system adopted was never meant to support this many people. Unfortunately I haven't seen a system that could, without excluding a decent percentage of those that want to host raids. I for one feel uncomfortable with trying to say who is &quot;capable and worthy&quot; of doing X raid, and who isn't. THAT system I don't think could work, ultimately. And while camping the boards is annoying, its alot less of a hassle then having 3 raids show up in Fear at the same time. Wouldn't you agree?<br>
<br>
All FFA (or FCFS; although they're basically the samething) is, is board camping taken to the game. It's more civil when left at the boards IMHO.<br>
<br>
I think the basic answer here is a server split for basic population, and faster spawn times for the uber mobs (72 hours as opposed to a week).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why you think Delsonora had anything to do with MAKING the current system we have. Delsonora just provided the medium through which it works. Big difference. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

My first post was a single rant.  I didn't try to find any truth in it.  I was upset at RL and took it out on a few things you said.<br>
<br>
It's not about Might makes right.  It's about 9 month long VS lists with numbers so screwed up it's not funny.<br>

It's not hard to see that if someone WANTED FFA, it would be here.<br>

Thats what all my bitchings been about, the biggest problem with our current system is;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the system.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> IS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> administered.<br>
<br>
By adminstered I do not mean Zesty and crew they do an unbelievable job and for free.(/rave 21 gun salute)<br>
<br>
By administered I mean some people here that won't acknowledge there are a shitload of post 50 guilds out there.<br>
<br>
This failure to take the blinders off is eventually going to get some raid devastated when  a posted raid and a what reservation raid show up on the same day somewhere.<br>
<br>
Now I like most of the &quot;Elder Guilds&quot;(SR,Abyss,LoH,CS etc etc etc) I always have fun on those occasions I group with thier members and attend thier raids but what about the middle Guilds like SoL,CA,LA,Knights ...(pick one  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
Whenever one of the members of these guilds voices an opinion its like a kid at the dinner table at Christmas (you know seen not heard go to another room Mom says 1,2 )<br>
<br>
If we're to continue to playing nice like we always have been we need better communication amongst guilds. <br>
<br>
You have to let the middle guilds get a voice at the dinner table, and you have to bring in the baby guilds when thier players start cresting level 40 because when they get that far they are going to 50.<br>
<br>
I've tried to gather support for a meeting and have had the well I don't see the need for it lecture way too many times.<br>
<br>
We do need it if for only the purpose of getting awareness of how things are managed on brell out to all the up and coming guilds and there are many good ones out there, I play alot of twinks I see the new generation daily they have no idea about this part of the brell world.<br>
<br>
As for VS I agree with that particular list being a nightmare I honestly don't have an answer for resolving that issue(wish I did) but FCFS/FFA are not the answer to any of our problems just going to add to our problems.<br>

<br>
Nillon just a few things:<br>
<br>
I don't think Kruunch is wrong as you say.  If Delsonora is the one who came up with this system, damn my hat is off to him because it has lasted this long with not very much contention in comparison to the FCFS everyone is raving about now.  :::Gets spoon and begins to gag:::  Sometimes it is NOT a bad thing that someone outside of the details MAY come up with a decent system.   I don't think specific criteria was in the designers mind for when this was designed, so to use that phrase &quot;it wasn't designed for this many people to support&quot; doesn't make sense.  If the designer put in all this criteria and then designed it..ok fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some further comments on what you have noted:<br>
<br>
                         1. 1 person can have the same rights as 40 people.<br>
Again..this has been addressed over and over.  One person, Indy, can lead a spot but they enlist 30 to 45 people to perform the raid, some MAY include SR, me, LOH, whoever.  Just because YOU choose not to make friends or go on others raids (which is what you've stated before..you siad you never have fun and always regret when you go on others raids but your own - which i dont' have a problem with to each his own but don't shove it down my throat), then that is your problem.<br>
<br>
                         2. You have to post at 12:00:01 am to reserve a plane.<br>
Just because this MAY be an issue, and I happen to agree with you on this, it doesn't mean you have to redo the whole damn system.  I'm all for trusting Zesty on her dice and putting everyone in a pool on a set criteria (like the first 15 guilds to sign up will be put in the pool but no guild can hold one within 3 weeks and if you do hate you can't do fear in that same time...dunno would be interesting to see this criteria) and it being divyied out.<br>
<br>
                         3. You have to wait months on the Dragon lists while a few people go to every raid.<br>
Again, the overcrowding IS an issue and it wont' be alleviated any time soon.  It is the price we pay waiting our turn so that we don't discount others.  Now, as for the &quot;few&quot; people. And how would you know?  I've probably gone on so many 'mongrel' raids before it isn't funny.  I have yet to see a large majority being the same people over and over and I've been on a shit load of raids.  This is a misperception not a fact.  Even if it was true, you are what your rep is.  Are we into saying who should go onto what raid and how many?  Anyway...not just a &quot;few&quot; people go on every raid. <br>
<br>
Kruunch was NOT wrong, he sees things differently.  Andy your first emails on this whole system thing loosely seemingly embraced FFA even if that isn't what you meant.  /shrug<br>
<br>
It's amusing how ppl go off on how many problems they have with todays system then sit there and yell about how everyone is bitching...funny their solution is fcfs..give mea  break.  If you thought this board was impossible on all the bitching and you are getting sick of it, let's just make it all ffa or fcfs and see what happens to us.  Of course remember, it will be too late to reverse it once you institute it.<br>
<br>
Saph  <br>
<br>
PS.  bare in mind that there are a ton of ppl 46 plus now that have no clue that this board even exists.  I'm doing my best to educate my guild members..but they had NO clue..and I know they aren't the only ones.  So whatever you set up today..will the spirit be carried on in those people?  The more defined the better in my opinoin.  Those that say that ppl can fcfs nicely really are in for a suprise.  From the regulars on this board, I MIGHT buy it..but for the upcoming ppl who aren't in these discussions, may &quot;interpret&quot; the spirit a little differently.  It's hard to &quot;interpret&quot; rules wrong.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A> at: 1/24/01 2:27:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uganonstormwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ganon Stormwynd</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.angelfire.com/il/selectevil/icons/Icon_Fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/24/01 3:48:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.greyhawk.net/gano1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A perspective</span><hr size=1> Kruunch.<br>
<br>
The FFA favorable mobs (Sever, Gore and Talendor) work well right now because no one feels they are entitled to them.  This can not be said of the reservable mobs.  We've been using a system that dictates everyone's &quot;right&quot; to every mob, regardless if they can actually kill them.<br>
<br>
&quot;The new expansion, Scars of Velios. I agree with you that this is as good a place to test new systems as any, since it is still widely under utilized on this server.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is all I'm asking.  Let's see what happens in Velious, see what guilds or individuals can handle a FFA environment.  Remove the entitlement people feel for every mob in the expansion, simply because the mob spawns.  <br>
<br>
Leave the old system alone.  Let it continue to be an appointment book for everyone interested in it.  That's fine.  SR can keep killing Venril every 9 months, and Trakanon every 20 days.  We've been doing that, and we'll continue to adhere to the rules.<br>
<br>
Here we have a compromise.  Old stuff, a lot of which is still very desirable to any guild or individual on this server, is still reservable.  Some of the newer stuff in Velious, which is by and large ignored or out of reach of everyone on this server, including SR, left FFA.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mavrin.<br>
<br>
I think it's rediculous to equate a desire for FFA to greed.  Everyone in this game wants &quot;shit&quot;.  Small guilds, who couldn't handle a FFA environment are greedy because they couldn't get the mobs governed by the reservation system otherwise.  Larger guilds who condone FFA are greedy because they feel they're being taken advantage of.  Independents, a large majority of whom actually claim items on raids, just want their piece of the pie.  We're all trying to get stuff.  Point fingers at everyone, and I'll agree with you.<br>

You people crack me up.  Thanks for my daily amusement.<br>
<br>
With SoV and epic weapons there are so many mobs to raid.  Personally I'm pretty happy with how everything currently is.  Look at the names of those complaining most about the system, it's the same small handfull over and over.  I laugh my ass off becuase it's amazing how the same stupid conversation can last for 2 or more months.  It's like a dog chasing it's tail.  Keeps running around and around, never going anywhere, never getting closer to catching that darn tail. <br>
<br>
Maybe I have just been really lucky or something.  I have never had a problem or an issue scheduling or taking a shot at mobs, planes, ect.  Then again, I'm quite content with what I have and obtained in the game, suppose that makes a differance to my outlook on things.<br>

This isnt a joke either folks this person has alot of support who suggested this to me.

On a serious note Maya, don't say that kind of stuff unless you want to back it up.  If you want to insinuate that SR, Elysian, Enshadowed, LoH, Watchers, Skyre, and Abyss are interested in taking over the server, name names.  Prove it.<br>

There might be one or two people that would like to think they could pull that off.<br>

No way in Hell.  You will not see those guilds cooperating to that extent.  Not with the current leadership that exists in several of those guilds.  They simply wouldn't put up with that crap.  If someone did manage to pull that off, the resulting alliance would be a pale shadow of what once made those guilds reknowned. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1458<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/24/01 4:15:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A perspective</span><hr size=1> What I find interesting about you saying that Maya is I&quot;ve actually had that feeling for a bit.

Redspine, not sure what side of the fence you are on.  That is the second post you have printed saying the exact same thing.  I guess you could say the same thing about our arguments.  But there is a fact here.  If the popular higher level guilds get together and &quot;decide&quot; on something, what are you going to do about it and  more importantly what have you done about it?  You are an upcoming fairly new respected guild when it is all said and done..SOH isn't far behind your guild in terms of levels and ability.  It is your right to not care to get into these discussions and laugh off to the sidelines, I make no judgement on you.  To lay down and take it from some of these people who post crap though is not wasting as much breathe as you think.  You never know the future /shrug.  Atleast I can tell my guild members as their guild leader that I looked out for their best interest.  That is why I post here on this topic.  <br>

I can think of about 6 guilds off the top of my head.  All you really need to toss a wrench in things.  But then, we would be no better then most of the other servers on EQ with 2 or 3 Uber Guilds.  We would only be different in we would have Uber Alliances.<br>
<br>
Power and Control are dangerous things.  And that is what an Alliance like that deep down is after.  Power to kill what, when and where they wish.  <br>
