Back then my Paladin friend had a Red Dragon Bp, and about 5 pieces of Valorium, the friend of mine who he dueled (the warrior) had full Indocolite from Hate, a bloodfire and draco claws (best weapon combo for a warrior at the time). They were both dwarves, so it was funny to watch. Anyway, they dueled and my Paladin buddy beat the Warrior who had better equipment without even casting 1 spell. It was amazing how good Fiery Avenger was.<br>
<br>
The next week I got my FA, then Kunark came out weeks later. I quit my Paladin a few months into Kunark because it was getting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> extremely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> hard to get groups and solo'ing we not an option by any means back then. I played an enchanter that was 55, because enchanters were always wanted and were godly.<br>
<br>
A couple of months went on and my desire to play my Paladin was rekindled and I leveled him to 60. I was a little slow compared to the other Paladins, I think I was 4th or 5th on server to gain 60 as a Paladin. Then Velious came out and things started to change some, and finally with Luclin Paladins went from being the least wanted in groups and very weak on raids to being <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> highly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> wanted in groups and desireable on raids.<br>
<br>
I started on August 2nd of 1999, I've got about 2.5 years in my Paladin and about 250 played days in him. I wouldnt play any other class even if I was given the option<br>

Pre RoK was bliss.  I'd no idea of the hill I was climbing but all tanks except the rangers were equal in desirablity in groups so I thought my slow leveling was given to my wandering and not playing more then 6-7 hours a day.  The only class envy I knew of was the necro pet envy all melees had.   Then RoK came and I was excited for 5 days.  Then my paladin suddenly found LFG and /ooc jokeing a major part of gameing.  It was hard and I almost gave up until I heard SOV was comming.  We all hoped we'd be fixed then but atlast it didn't happen and the paladin jokes came more and more and the exp burden became too much and many paladins left or started alts to be mains or like me left for months at a time.  I didn't even know the exp penalty was removed til about the time SoL came out.   I'd have given up all hope and baught SoL only to see horses before I finaly left eq for good.  <br>
  <br>
     It was a surpirse to me to see verent fix not just one minor problem but many minor problems of the paladins.  I can actualy go to a zone and not be the joke of the classes.  But atlast I'm like a horse that's been beaten.  I don't tust verant and I look for the first true game better.  I'll bolt the day I find it.<br>
<br>
As for not getting groups durring kunark do to being a poor player or not good equipment? hmm let me recall my equipment back before SoL<br>
Treeweave -bp<br>
Wurmslayer -1hs<br>
Ro greaves- legs<br>
SSB then frogloc crown -head<br>
shield was mistmore for saves or the one with 12ish ac and +9str<br>
Hero bracer and scavenger bracers.- wrists<br>
Derveage mantel - shoulders<br>
Mithrel arms - arm<br>
Golden mask or gnoll mask - face I'm human so seeing was needed.<br>
Jagged bands - fingers.  I liked the ac5 +3 str rings<br>
runed lava pendent - neck<br>
fbss - waist<br>
ro boots - feet<br>
<br>
All and all not bad stuff considering it was kunark and late 40's.<br>
<br>
My groups had few deaths then the warriors<br>
<br>
Yet every group I was in that had a warrior with their first teir class specific armor. and dual weilding.  Despite my shield and wurm ac I still couldn't out tank a gnome warrior.  Groups of paladins and rangers and sk's were common in DL cause no one else would have us.  Aya and the days were darker indeed.  Guilds would refuse paladins for being paladins.  Our friends we hated to group with for we knew what exp penalty we'd bring them.  It was imho our darkest hour and one that to this day has left it's scars on many of paladins. <br>
<br>
I've learned whiney boards and feedback and letters to VI is what gets classes fixed and is the only chance we have of getting fixes.   Heck I feel stupid with some of the stuff I've asked for but have learned with vi, it's ask for the moon and get random a inch to jupitor.  &lt;&lt;--- verant insta nerfs anything that gives more then 3 inches now.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not think of the RoK to the SoL time cause it drags me down way too much.<br>
<br>
<br>
To those paladins better then me who didn't get lost in the self pity hole, this unworthy paladin salutes you for keeping your head high.<br>

I remember when there was NO lower guk.  I remember when lavastorm opened and the rumors of maybe a *wince* Dragon?...  I remember you NEVER travelled to the Karanas unless you had a full group, there were Griffons in there that could wipe out entire parties.<br>
<br>
I was a rare site to see outside of Qeynos, it took days for Dwarves to travel there and we were often looked at as oddities to the humans.  (hrm... maybe we still are? hehe)<br>

Been a Paly since early Beta days, and will always be one!  Same name, Same Class, Same Race.<br>
<br>
During early beta, one of the highest levels attained through normal play testing was a 39ish? Cleric.  We use to awe at him, when he would (try to) solo the Spectres in Ro.<br>

Troll Shadowknights were the most powerful characters in game.  Verant made sure to nerf them good before they went live.<br>

I remember many trying times... getting shut out from groups, being forced to duel pets for a spot, the jokes, the 'wet cardboard' insults etc. There was a time around level 35 I was ready to quit, wondering what the hell I was doing playing a paladin. Gorfan, Rennol, Derringer, and Iustus talked me into toughing it out on the VN boards. (I doubt they even remember!) I truly thank and salute all of those who walked before me.<br>
<br>
All of the more recent changes, especially the rez line, have me somewhat concerned. There will be an influx of new paladins, and I pray they too exhibit the ideals that a paladin stands for. Paladins may not be the strongest class, but are driven by some of the classiest people I've ever known. EQ will be (and really is already) a totally different experience now than it was before. AA points are an awesome addition and the items available to paladins now are great. I'm probably the last paladin who will ever venture into Guk and solo AM without haste and wielding an ACG (still have that sword too, 16 months running) Too bad all these changes come when I'm all but retired!

Same as you,  Been Same Name,  Same Race , Same Class since Phase 2 Beta.<br>
<br>
Back in the days when you died, you got WHACKED for em.<br>
When all buffs stacked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ,   When You died for no reason from falling when zoning or just running along.<br>
<br>
When the walk from Qeynos to freeport took you a few hours,  cause you did not hav 100 spoilers sites telling you<br>
the way to go.  <br>
<br>
Finally coming to realize that there is no other Exit in highhold keep after a few deaths.<br>
<br>
Finally making it over to Elf land and dying before you could get a bind! Woot not fun!<br>
<br>
Lets see what else,  We had alot lower hps,  less weapons skills,  less defense,  Hell less weapons and armor. Spells were very weak back then,  was easy to decide what spells to have up. Now its a harder choice.<br>
<br>
I may have other 50+ guys,  but I will alway be a Paladin.<br>
Hell I got 2 lvl 60 paladins , and a lvl 49 1 as well.  So I guess<br>
you can say I am dedicated to the paladin class.<br>
