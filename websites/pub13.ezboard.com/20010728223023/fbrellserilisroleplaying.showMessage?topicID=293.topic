<br>
The little baby with the violet eyes captured the heart of every &quot;lady&quot; that walked the halls of the temple.  Children were not normally in the temple as most Mother's found the place distasteful and tawdry.  The women in the closest village whispered about the goings on there over the fences between their houses and in the marketplace.  Gossip about the &quot;ladies&quot; short dresses and their preaching of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;sacred rights&quot; to the people who went to the temple. How the men watched the &quot;ladies&quot; as they came to town to do business.  And they even whispered about the Goddesses own history and closeness with her Brother.<br>
<br>
But none of this heard by the little child running in her tunic through the gardens.  She is a fair haired little girl that loves to be the center of attention.  She learns her lessons quickly because she absolutely adores hearing her tutors tell her how smart she is.  By the age of 6 she can read almost anything in the library but is most often found reading the volumes of love sonnets and poems.  It is no longer a complete night in the temple if the girl does not recite a new poem after dinner.  <br>
<br>
The only time when she was not being the shining light of the Temple is when you would find her in a tower window looking out over the land.  One of the &quot;ladies&quot; had taken the child into her heart and she would go to her and ask her what was wrong.  The girl would turn and smile and say &quot;I am going to go there someday.&quot;  The &quot;lady&quot; would run a hand through the childs hair and say &quot;Where brighteyes?&quot;  At that the child would turn back to the window and calmly say &quot;Everywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the age of 7 a travelling bard came to the temple.  He played after dinner and the child was fascinated.  He had dark hair, a moustache and was a bit smaller than the &quot;ladies&quot; of the temple, but he was so caring and warm.  There was a nasty storm for the month of May and he stayed a week.  Every chance she got the child was at his feet listening to his tales and maoving her fingers like she was playing a lute.  He watched her closely and would teach her the melodies to sing with him.  He voice was sweet and pure and he never had to teach her the tune more than once.  <br>
<br>
But alas, as a travelling bard the time came for him to leave.  He took one of her teachers aside and explained that the girl had one of the most pure examples of bardic magic that he had ever encountered at her age and he went into town and bought her a small lute.  When he gave it to her and showed her how to play, she tried to play and when it did not sound right she turned and ran.  He found her in the window and asked her what was wrong.  Eyes filled with tears she told him &quot;I can not play it.&quot;  The soft little face and trembling lips almost broke his heart.  &quot;Little one,&quot; he started, &quot;it takes years of practice to learn.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;But I learned how to sing already why can't I play?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Training your fingers to an instrument is not like following the notes with your voice.  You must relearn how your fingers act in relation to the sounds you desire.&quot;  He found that trying to explain the concepts to one so young was difficult indeed.  Her guardian took him aside as he was leaving and told him that they had called for a musinc trainer from another temple to come to train her.  As he walked away he made a note to himself to visit this temple and this special child at least once a year. <p><center>
