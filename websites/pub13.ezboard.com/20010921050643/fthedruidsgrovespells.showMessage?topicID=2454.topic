I have been fighting HG's in FM for 4 or 5 lvls now and until last night never grouped with more than 1 Cleric.  I didn't realize how much better they are for a group until we had 2 and 1 was using Wrath (210dm / 145m) and rooting for croud control (their root seems to hold).  I knew they could heal better but never realize how much better their buffs are (Bravey 140HP for 70m, Guard AC+20 for 80m) and of course Sybol (158hp for 111m).<br>
<br>
It never occured to me that they could hit harder than we can with a DD, and since most of our fights don't last a minute, Doting looses effiecency.  It was kinda of funny when the clerics asked me to be primary healer so they could buff, park and DD and you know it worked really well!  I know balance changes significantly as we lvl but when I saw I'm stuck with SLS until 39 it just added to my depression:).  <br>
<br>
I have been told many times that I group well (for a Druid) and never have a problem getting a group but now I almost feel like I'm holding them back, you throw in a ranger with snare and a Mag with DS and well:(.  Anyway I appoligize for the Wineing, tell me it gets better when we start getting the &quot;pack&quot; spells and i'll be a happy guy:).<br>

  Comparing Druids to Clerics is like comparing apples to<br>
  oranges in all respects except buffs and healing. At higher<br>
  levels our DDs are much more mana efficient and we get<br>
  some pretty hefty stackable dots. As for healing, we are<br>
  only meant to be secondary healers. Dropping Sup Heal down<br>
  to level 51 was huge and Chloroblast at 55 is incredible but<br>
  we'll never compare to the sheer healing power of a cleric.<br>
  Also, lets not forget group regeneration spell line. I've been<br>
  told quite a few times by clerics I've grouped with that this<br>
  has saved them a lot of mana because they don't have to<br>
  'top off' someone's hit points to get them fully healed.<br>
<br>
  Our buff line...well SLN and NS are awesome, most tanks<br>
  would rather have NS than hero but the only real problem<br>
  I have is the mana costs. 400 mana for NS...ouch, group<br>
  hero costs 420. Necros also are pretty demanding of NS<br>
  since it gives an extra 4 hp/tick regen.<br>
<br>
  Last but not least, our limited spells VS summoned creatures.<br>
  There are a LOT more summoned things in the game now<br>
  than where were when I first started (I was pre-kunark) and<br>
  a larger number of places to solo. These spells are incredibly<br>
  mana efficient and seem to have a low resist rate.<br>
<br>
  You're only level 33, hang in there. At 34 you get a better<br>
  wolf form and your first ranged AE spell (lightning strike)<br>
  with which you'll learn to multi-kite. It took me 6 weeks of<br>
  'casual' playing to get from 34 to 49, hardcore playing would<br>
  have been about 1-2 weeks max. Quadding you'll spend less<br>
  time in level 40 and 45 than you did in level 10 (assuming<br>
  you wern't plevelled /grin).<br>

<br>
The other important part when multi-kiting is to select mobs that all move at the same speed when snared.  As an example, sabertooth tigers and rhinos in OT move faster snared than the rest.  But sarnaks, cactuses (cactii?), and cockatrices all move at the same rate.  <br>
<br>
Once you can quad kite these little guys, you can make a yellow bubble an hour from level 36 all the way through level 46 (double the time for 40 and 45, being hell levels), or even faster if you have clarity. And then at 45 you can use ES Vambs.  If you worship Tunare you can then go get the 3rd symbol of Tunare and root and dot for 0 mana.  <br>
<br>
By the time you reach 39 and then even moreso 44, you'll have a lot more to offer a group that will differentiate you from a cleric.  <br>

In the lower levels, it is as good or better than druid. from 24 to 38, wrath is better than combust, and from 44 to 48, retribution is better than firestrike. They start to fall behind once druids get Starfire, but from 24 to 48, druids only out-nuke clerics for 5 levels. Before 24, the nukes are pretty close. Who does the most damage goes back and forth over those levels. <br>
<br>
For buffs, cleric courage line is always better than druid skin line, except for the short period from 49 to 51 when druid have SLN, and before clerics get Heroism. Then, at 60, druids take over the AC+HP slot for the final time with Protection of the Glades. <br>
<br>
Healing is not even close. Even without complete heal, cleric healing is VASTLY superior to druid heal. Celestial heal ALONE is better than anything we EVER get. Up to 34, druids can serve to heal ALMOST as well as clerics. From then on, druids fall further and further behind. My 46 cleric is about 3 or 4 times as effective at healing as my 55 druid, and that is taking mana store into account. <br>
<br>
Clerics are a kick-ass class! <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

We run across the &quot;standard&quot; pairing of a Warrior and Cleric often and everytime we have to laugh.  Yes the cleric is a far superior healer/buffer, and yes that warrior can take and give a bunch o damage, but when my friend and I decide we want to hunt Wurms...poof!  5 seconds later we're killing wurms.  We decided we want to go back to kobbies in SolB...poof!  5 seconds later we're killing kobbies.  SOW, dmg shield, dot, dd, debuff, snare, harmony, healing, regen...throw in the SK's pet, dots, fear, FD...need I go on? :)  Yes clerics are awesome healers but they are specialists.  What you give up in healing power you gain in the myriad of other skills we have.  There will [i]always[/i] be a group combination that will render almost any class useless.  As you mentioned, throw in a ranger, cleric, and magi and what does a druid add?  Well he still adds regen and dots, but still.  If you're not a Cleric, Warrior, or Chanter then you must shake the notion that to be &quot;useful&quot; you have to be useful in [i]every[/i] situation.  Find your niche, find groups where you can fill that niche, and have fun :)<br>
