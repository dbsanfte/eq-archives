My partner in light is a 26th level High Elf Male Enchanter named Isotope.  We have stuck together through thick or thin, have met a few interesting people, but mostly it is just the two of us.  Isotope is an incredible chanter, and I'm pretty darn good at what I do, if I do say so myself.  (I've played a cleric, wizard, enchanter, and monk to at least 30th... my highest is 59)<br>
<br>
The point?  This duo is so incredibly fun!  Between his spells and CC, and my healing and sudden miracles, we are able to handle a lot between the two of us.<br>
<br>
The dilemma?  We do not want to do the Oasis/Lake/FM/OT/DL/KC routine because, frankly, it's boring and you learn nothing by doing it.  You also meet your fair share of ya-yas.  But what should we do?  Where do we meet quality people to group with, still gain xp, and be able to handle ourselves in a duo situation if necessary?<br>
<br>
Last night we tried Feerott, and while it was a little tough, the xp didn't match the amount of effort, IMHO.  We've been spending a lot of time in Paludal Caverns, but it's sounding more and more like Lake of Ill Omen every day, and everything is turning light blue to us.<br>
<br>
What to do?  Where to go?  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
Oh, as a final note... why are there never any more than 1 or 2 visible Erudite Paladins on?  Do we suck or something?<br>

But there are a couple reasons that they may be unpopular.<br>
<br>
1) Their starting stats are not as good as other races.  This isn't really that big of a problem as this can be offset with gear.  And now you have AA to add up to 10 more points into each stat.<br>
<br>
2) If your using new models some people may not like the huge forehead.  Again this isn't really a problem as you can find good roleplay value of it even learn to like the uniqueness after a while.  Their heads are larger because they are a wise race and have grown large brains, and their skulls have increased to house and protect their wisdom, etc. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
I almost played an erudite paladin when i first chose mine, this was when i first opened the box and had no idea about classes/races, starting stats, equipment choices or anything.<br>
<br>
I really like the way the new Erudite Paladins look in shadows of luclin.  They look bad ass.  I really like that leg sash they have.<br>
<br>
Just be glad you are unique =)  There are still very few gnome, halfling or erudite paladins around.  So it helps you to stand out a bit more.<br>

The only thing you both lack is snare, but root and stuns will do.<br>
<br>
At 26 you might want to try:<br>
Runnyeye - Great dungeon for a duo. You can't go too deep yet, but there is a a lot you can do on the second level. Beware of the evil eye room (there are two of them in there!).<br>
<br>
Permafrost - This might be a little difficult for only two, mainly because you'll have to go in pretty deep before things become challenging<br>
<br>
Gorge of King Xorn - not much to do here, but the evil eyes are about level 30 enchanters. You haven't played EQ until you've been on the recieving end of an enchanter. If you take on one that doesn't have a pet (or kill the pet 1st) one of you may get charmed, beware.<br>
<br>
Outside Splitpaw or inside but not past the double doors - not super safe at 26, but it's easy to find a group.<br>
<br>
Unrest - Inside the house but on the 1st floor only.<br>
<br>
Mistmoore - I can't say too much about this place, but the few times I've been there its been a blast.<br>
<br>
Stonebrunt - Pretty much a change of pace outdoor zone. Most agree this place is very dangerous for an outdoor zone, but the kobold camps are pretty easy.<br>
<br>
Sometime around levels 30 to 35, you should really try Crystal Caverns and see how deep you can go. It's one of the best dungeons in the game.<br>
<br>
If you want to meet people but want to avoid LOIO, try highpass in the basement. It's very popular, but not much variety (can you kill only goblins for 10 levels?)<br>
<br>
Some old timers may tell you SolA, but I have never seen another soul there, so I've never gotten past the entrance. The two of you may have better luck. No one even seems to raid there, so sad.<br>

I personally find that the players who do this lack a number of class and grouping skills when they get into higher end grouping and raid situations. I also can't imagine spending my whole career single pulling outdoor zone crits. The boredom has to be mind boggling. <br>
<br>
If at all possible you might want to try and add a few more core members and head into the dungeons. Unfortunately in alot of dungeons its hard to pick up extra players. Dalnirs is a great one for xp at your levels and it has a mix of type of creatures so is a good place to work on enchanter and paladin skills. In the near future you also have options in Splitpaw, Nurga, &amp; Droga. You can also hit Sol A which has great xp but I don't remember the top in level range there. I'm not sure of the new level range of Runnyeye but that might be an option. <br>
<br>
If you can't find too many others you could still do some of these areas but I would recommend picking up a healer of some type. Paladins are great at protecting casters but on multiple pulls where the enchanter gets resists you might have a hard time keeping the enchanter alive while you are being beat on. Hehe and as you probably know enchanters die fast as you get into the higher levels.<br>
<br>

Both at 26, I would say entrance to mistmoore. I found this difficult at first because I was still learning the intricacies of 2 boxing and hadn't macro'd yet. But as two different people this won't be an issue. You can get bronze and FS, and more importantly research components for the chanter here. It's good fun and the zoneline is *right* there if it get's hairy. Stay here until zone mobs, and courtyard are green.<br>
<br>
At 29 (clarity) go to lguk, I know on my server the entrance is rarely camped, mobs die when ppl plow through going deeper but besides that you're looking at some good clean undead frog killin. With chanter buffs and paladin staying power you're good to go here. <br>
<br>
I can't comment on variety much from this point cause I lived in guk till 54. I know that sounds extreme but it went VERY fast.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.<br>

Not only that, but why even HAVE the other zones in the world.  VI could just save a lot of money and patch time if they just got rid of the other 100 zones.<br>
<br>
We're not looking to rocket through levels... we're looking for adventure, exploration, and quests... and the only exploration you get in the Lake Tract is to explore the limits of your patience and good graces.  And if Iso and I can duo in a dungeon, that will make us much more attractive to guilds later simply because we HAVE a clue.<br>

There is more to the game than the 50+ levels. In fact 1-50 can be even more fun. If you haven't tried anything but the lake route, you should seriously consider making and alt and trying again.<br>

I've gotten numerous compliments and went about 3 weeks of grouping in Seb, KC, etc. without a single fatality.<br>
<br>
Trust me, if you already have a high level character, you've been around long enough to know just about everbody's role. Maybe only pet classes like mages and necros elude me. /shrug <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/02 12:58:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15610.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turn to the Dark Side</span><hr size=1> I have gotten to the point where I really dislike the LOIO/OT/DL leveling grind.  Aside from putting up with powergamers and lewt doods, there isn't much fun in seeing the same scenery and killing the same mobs for 20 or 30 levels.  So, I try to find dungeons to hunt.  My paladin solod unrest for 8 or 9 levels.  I am going to check out Kaesora and Tower of Frozen Shadows as well.  Another good place for mid 20's is Najena.  It has a exp bonus and there are some undead you can kill.  You also might consider snow cougars in Iceclad Ocean.  They occasionally drop cougar claw earrings and are pretty easy to kill.<br>
To me, one of the best aspects of EQ is the large world with plenty of zones to explore and different mobs to kill.  I think people get too caught up in how many bubbles they make per hour (I have been guilty of this) and don't really enjoy the rest the game has to offer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucatyra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catyra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 108<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/20/02 9:18:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15610.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/shokaroffreeport/counsel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Turn to the Dark Side</span><hr size=1> I had no problem with Lake of Ill Omen...it was after that when I decided that KUNARK was a big wasteland that no one should ever go to.  In Dreadland, OT, and KC, you will meet the Rudest Doods alive.<br>
<br>
My path is as follows:  Lake of Ill Omen till 29.  Frontier Mountain Giant fort till 2 forest loops...then RUN away.<br>
<br>
A Paladin can easily solo, especially in off hours, in Everfrost hunting Momma Mammoths.  Hasted?  Watch out Mommas!!<br>
Their tusks sell for 7-9 plat each, and you can make a mint.  Then at 35 you can go to Rathe Mountains, and make a mint.  Then at 39 you can go to SOL B until, 54ish if your partner is a chanter.  Oh yea - you can make a mint there.<br>
<br>
35 on you can do various places in velious - if coinage is not of concern to you.  Leave the poor Tizmaks alone.  I made the mistake of hunting them - and they really don't drop much, and now the greenies bother me all the time.<br>
<br>
Tower of Frozen Shadows is a blast...A Tower filled 90% with undead.  Good loot, nice drops, and loads of fun. <p><CENTER>

<br>
There aren't a lot of Erudite Paladins because Gaunt is an Erudite.  The last thing most people want to be like is Gaunt.<br>
