I personally didnt like any (even if i've seen some very good ideas) as much as the old system we have been using for months now.<br>
<br>
In my mind, the main problem with all of them was that they werent simple enough. When you start adding new rules, you just cant be as fair, because some rules will favor big guilds, some will favor independants...<br>
As a result, the more you add rules, the less the brell community agrees with them. For example, Adun's system had rather firm rules, and havent been really *accepted* by everyone.<br>
<br>
So, since i was bored as hell at work today, i started working on some SIMPLE rules, that wouldnt be unfair to anyone...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   1) GENERAL RULES<br>
<br>
   1-The raid Leader must be of the appropriate level for the raid he is planning the day he is posting (46+ for a plane raid, at least 8 levels below the level of the Uber Mob he intends to slay, and high enough to be allowed by the Gods to fight that Mob)<br>
<br>
   2-The Raid Leader must provide, in his first post, the loot rules, the time, date and location of the start of the raid and the name of 2 Lieutenants (the 2 lieutenants cannot be alts of the leader, must be in his guild if it's a guild raid, and must be of the appropriate level the day the thread is started - their role is to take over the raid if the leader is LD and cannot log back in or has to log for a RL emergency), and must post if he does not want to raid with another guild for Uber Mobs (see that section for more details)<br>
<br>
   3-The Raid Leader must make sure his raid will not interfere with a raid already posted and sheduled for before or after his own raid (a raid should start at least 2 hours + repop time before the raid sheduled for the next day - this is of course for regular mobs)<br>
<br>
   4-Trading a date for another (or a spot for another in the rotation lists for Uber Mobs) is allowed only once for each raid, and no compensation should be given (items, money, another spot in another rotation, a spot on a raid... all of them are forbidden). All trades will only be allowed if a moderator has been consulted and if he/she agreed to it.<br>
A raid leader cannot trade a raid if  his raid is the next one on the list (or if his plane raid is the next day)<br>
<br>
    5-Any Uber Mob or plane up before a server reset are considered FFA (FFA does not mean KSing is allowed, only that you have the right to kill them without having a reservtion), Before attempting them however, a raid leader must contact the leader/lieutenants of the raid supposed to kill them (if the plane was reserved, or if it's an Uber Mob with a waiting list) to make sure he is not going to try it himself.<br>
Any plane unclaimed is also considered FFA for the day, but only if you respect the 2 hours + repop time rule<br>
<br>
2) PLANE RAIDS (this includes Fear, Hate and Sky for now, growth and mischief might be added later)<br>
<br>
Reservations must be posted on the specific section<br>
Time, date and name of the leader/guild must be in the topic line<br>
<br>
Any Raid Leader(or guild) can only post 1 reservation for each plane<br>
<br>
Killing any repops of regular critters that wouldnt have the time to repop for the next raid is not allowed, even if it means giving up the God/boss of the plane (this rule is flexible in case a very few critters are killed during a CR, but it's only tolerated to kill them if you cannot do differently, killing 15 Mobs to get one corpse is not allowed)<br>
<br>
The Gods/Bosses of the planes are not reservable, and can be killed at any time but only by an organized raid<br>
<br>
It is only possible to post a raid 21 days before the day of the raid (instead of 14 now, 21 days means 21 days   &quot;board-time&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
3) UBER MOBS (this includes Nagafen, Vox, Venril Sathir, Trakanon for now, others might be added later)<br>
<br>
A raid leader must sign up on the specific section to be added to the waiting list, any raid leader or guild can only have one spot on any rotation at a time<br>
<br>
Any guild or independant will be assigned another guild or independant to raid with, unless they post in their thread that they do not wish to be associated with anyone else. No pressure should be put on any guild or independant not willing to raid with someone else,some guilds or independants with enough friends can easily fill most spots by themselves. <br>
The rules and conditions for raiding together are left to the guilds/independants, however  no compensations for agreeing to a compromise should be offered while negociating those conditions (no items, spots on raids, money...)<br>
If a compromise cannot be reached, contact the moderator asap for a new assignation, or if you decide you will be better off alone after all.<br>
IMPORTANT : noone will force you to raid with anyone, this is just a way to reduce the total number of raids, and it is STRONGLY recommended that you post a joint raid with another guild/leader directly, these will not have any guild or independant assigned (posting in the raid discussion forum that you are looking for a partner might be a good idea)<br>
<br>
A raid leader has 2 full days (48 hours) to try as many times as he wants to slay the Mob, he can pass his turn any time he wants, but if after 48 hours the Mob is still up, the next raid leader on the list will be up to attempt to kill the critter<br>
The raid leader (or his lieutenants) must post on this board the exact time the Mob was killed to make other people's sheduling easier<br>
<br>
4) OTHER ZONES<br>
<br>
Raids sheduled for all the other zones and mobs of norrath are considered intentions only and are not reservations<br>
<br>
Any plane or Uber Mob not listed in 2) or 3) is considered an intention (velious ones are still here until we figure out spawn times, raid habits, levels...)<br>
<br>
You may have as many intentions posted as you want<br>
<br>
<br>
5) NOTES<br>
<br>
No rules about the loot, behaviour, sing ups...<br>
This is your problem and only yours<br>
If you shedule a sky raid and only sit on the first island for a strip poker, noone will have anything to say about that<br>
<br>
The rules are simple enough to fit in most situations, and can be modified easily if there is any need to do so (new Mobs/planes to add for example)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
if you have any questions (i'm sure i managed to be unclear again on some points <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ) or suggestions...<br>
<br>
just a note.. i've been in both big guilds, small guilds and independant, so i've tried to be as fair for everyone as i could (for example an indy can lead 1 trakanon raid and a big guild 1, but everyone on the big guild will go to 1 raid, and so will the indy)<br>
<br>
god i love when i have the time to be bored at work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
bah i'm just going to do it myself !<br>
<br>
1) errr dude, your system is not really doing anything to stop abuses unlike the other systems<br>
<br>
i disagree with this, making a lot of rules wouldnt help, because the more rules you have, the easier it is to find a way to dodge them<br>
when your system is simple, noone can say they didnt understand it<br>
it's not helping more than any other system, but it does make it harder to screw the system without people noticing it<br>
<br>
2) yo man, wots up with that ? wtf you doing with plane raids ? they were fine i thought ?<br>
<br>
well, planes have been more and more camped, and when velious will get old, they will be packed up against like they were before it came out<br>
a lot of new high level players will come, and we will need room, as living together will be harder, that's why i think it's time to refresh it a bit<br>
<br>
3) who cares about wtf you're saying ?<br>
<br>
noone, that's exactly why i'm posting, to piss you off<br>
<br>

Your proposal solves none of the problems we have.<br>
<br>
None.<br>
<br>
That's why no one is posting... there is no reason to even think about it.  Nothing good or bad on it... so why bother...<br>
<br>
The only reason we would change a system is because it's Better.  ie helps out.  Yours is just fancy words for the stuff we have now.<br>

i post it, you complain<br>
<br>
note to self : shut the fuck up and go back to your dark corner<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
less ironic, but still reflecting my thoughts, the only way you cold *fix* what you think is going wrong is by screwing up someone<br>
denying one sort of players of the other to do raids<br>
<br>
the only point of my system was to clear up the rules and add things like the automatic sharing with another guild to make the lists shorter<br>
<br>
knowing you, i know you think what poofingman did was BS and you prolly ranted about it on the guildchat, sorry to disagree, but with my system it couldnt happen<br>
<br>
i do believe everyone is looking too far to find an imaginary solution<br>
the ONLY way to allow everyone to raid VS more often is to encourage people to raid together, and the current system does not do that<br>
<br>
and of course i'm sure you opinion was not influenced by the fact you dont want indies to be able to lead raids on the ubermobs huh ? <p><BR>

<br>
I specificly like the ideas of Lieutenants which prevent people from just signing up, gathing a bunch of people then having other people take over because he does not lack the skills. I also think this should be made to reflect that all 3 are leading the raid inessence, it still the person who's signed up's raid. <br>
<br>
Also I think having smaller guilds team up is the perfect idea. Basicly I think the reason the smaller guilds sign up is so they can make sure there whole guild has a chance to go, when two smaller guilds sign up they still have that oppertunity, and they have it more often since the list would get smaller.<br>
<br>
Although I would like to see a rule added that guildless people cannot claim a peice of loot, I dont see any problems with the system as a whole. If anyone else does please comment, but seeing the lack of comments that doesnn't appear to be the case.<br>
<br>
Basicly, it tries to curb abuse, still advocate fairness to all, and rely on the honor system somewhat. As Lithgow said in footloose, &quot;If we don't trust our childreen, how will they become trustworthy?&quot; <br>
<br>
See dynin, I knew you could do it. <br>

<br>
thanks for the imput, i will have to disagree with the loot rule though<br>
forcing an indy to follow a rule without forcing guilds to follow something about equal would be unfair and against the point of making a better system<br>
<br>
it would be just too easy to join a guild, lead a raid, and claim the item on the guild raid you're leading<br>
if such a rule was added, then noone would be allowed to claim an item...<br>
i personally dont like to put my nose in guild's and other people's loot rules... because then what should we do about guilds using a different system ?<br>
SR requires that you've been to at least 2 of their raids, LoH has a point system, watchers prolly has its own version...<br>
<br>
in other words, you cant allow a guild to do what they want and not the indies<br>
and i dont think any guild of the server would agree to a system forcing them to follow someone else's looting rules<br>
<br>
PS : if someone has negative imput.. i'd to know about it at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>
