Ahh... Brell would be pleased with them they said...alas, He was not.<br>
<br>
Brell, the God of the UnderEarth, held a secret conference with Karana, Lord of the Skies.  Brell spake, &quot;The Reavers attempt to please me, but they are not my creation.  Why do they be kind when they are trying to kill my true love, my Dwarves and Gnomes?  Karana, I ask you to destroy them with Molleni as she is powerful beyond ages and she can destroy them.&quot;<br>
<br>
So came Molleni's mission.<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
The leaves flew about the air as I crossed the iron bridge.  The water sang its low, sweet melody as it churned...never changing, but always remaining.  I smiled.  The river, so sweet and gentle, was the Druid's playground.  I set my clothes to the side, my wind brushing my naked skin, and slide silently into the water, its coolness overflowing me and feeling me with excitement.  I swam with slow strokes, over and under the water, feeling the minnows glide between my feet and the mud between my toes as I sank to the bottom.  I heard the cries of the fishes in there excitement...and suddenly I felt a million stings.  I felt an intense heat and wondered what it was.  I suddenly felt calm, serenity and I knew my Father, Karana, had taken me home.  I saw His warm smile, and smiled back at one who I loved deeply.<br>
<br>
His words filled the chamber we rested in, His words filled my mind with His wisdom.  And after He spoke to me, He sent me to earth.  I was at the place where I had embarked into the water.  I looked up to the sky to see clouds gathering overhead, and I prayed that my Father would watch over me.  I closed my eyes, and grab some dirt.  I rubbed it through my hands, and felt the soft earth.  I grinned, and enchanted the dirt tossing it upon my naked self, and went deep inside myself.  I felt the very earth become apart of me, and I felt myself a part of the earth.  A great oak tree rose from the ground as I towered above the small people milling about the Karana field.  My blood corsed through as sap, my skin the bark, and my hands the branches as I prepared to begining the destruction of the dreaded reaver temple.<br>
<br>
I waited by the roadside patiently speaking softly to myself, and befriending a nearby animal.  As he approached the tree, the first reaver came into my sight.  I commanded the wolf to attack, and as it charged into the helpless gnoll, I summoned the very earth to come up and entangle his feet.  The gnoll struggled in his bonds, but when he caught sight of the wolf, he scowled and prepared to attack.  His broadsword flickered as he slashed the wolf's skin, but the wolf counterattacked with a swift bite of his jaw.  Instinctively the wolf dodged the next swing, which was low and attempted to dismember one of his feet.  He jumped and leaped upon the gnoll, biting and clawing at his soft tunic and bluish skin inside.  From behind, I began to chant and the grass seemed to sway as it tore from the ground and formed a protective barrier around the small wolf.  The gnoll, suprised by this, began to rush at the tree that he saw was casting the hateful spells.  But his feet we're still entangled within the grass.  The gnoll screamed as the wolf attacked again and tore into his back, his naked flesh ripped open by the relentless claws of the wolf.  I began to chant again and from the trees, I heard the sound of the swarm of bees coming quickly.  The gnoll howled in fear as he heard the whine of their deathcry, and finally the wolf fell over dead when the stang him with a thousand stings.  <br>
<br>
I stretched up and flexed my branches as the wolf returned to my side.  I fell to the ground as I transformed back to my normal figure, and began to scribe into my scrollbook the spell Ring of Commons that I had bought a couple of days before.  When at last that ardous task was completed, I began to memorize the spell.  I stood up from my meditation session and began to chant as lightining crashed all about me.  I sent the wolf on his way, and he wandered finally to the dead gnoll and began to gnaw on the remains.  I smiled once more as finally I felt the wind brush heavily against my skin and I felt lifted from the ground and teleported to the Commonlands.  <br>
<br>
I hit the ground hard and lost my balance.  My first time teleporting was painful, but I stood up and began to cast a healing spell upon myself to heal my light wounds.  I then turned to the nearby merchant and began bartering with her.  I traded the gnoll's Fine Steel Broadsword for the three spells I was looking for, Ring of Butcher, Ring of Karana, and Ring of Tox.  I sat down within the protection of the druid circle and scribed and memorized these spells.  I still had one more Fine Steel weapon and knew that the North Karana merchant liked shiny things and should be willing to part with the rest of my spells for this weapon.  After I recieved these spells, perhaps I could actually destroy that cursed temple...<br>
