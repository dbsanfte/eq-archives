No, I was referring to Nature's Touch.  The point being that most every druid pays for that spell (never heard of it dropping) while some shaman get Torpor for free (drops from juggs/dragons/etc).  If Torpor was sold in EC on a vendor for 70k, our shaman friend would have a better point.<br>

In fights against mobs with a weak ae and the cleric isn't in the rotation, it isn't uncommon at all to see them throwing some nukes around. Last time we were in NToV I saw one of our clerics get in the kill shot against one of the dragons, and I heard about a cleric getting the kill shot against the AoW before. My sister was telling me how much damage she did against the THO the other day when she wasn't in the rotation and it wasn't too shabby. Of course, when there is ae and other damage being taken, they won't be nuking (hopefully), but in those other cases it is better than just letting that mana sit there and go to waste. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart,

Mostly because should that tank get too much aggro, the best thing for them to do is move away.  A tank that can't move back fast enough usually = dead tank.  This also includes rampage range.  Multiple 2000 point rampages puts dampers on most people's days.<br>
<br>
Besides, this is all relatively worthless as far as an argument goes.  If you want to validate or negate the value of Torpor, go to the Shaman's Crucible and ask for opinions there.  <br>
<br>
The basis of this thread, and 99% of all the other "druids need help" threads on this board can almost all be traced back to one simple fact:  We have no set role in raids.<br>
<br>
I think one of the largest reasons that this still remains true today is because the actual Druid Community can't even figure out where it wants to end up.  40% of us want to be the premier secondary healers, 40% of us want to be the premier secondary nukers, and 20% of us want to have misc tasks like debuffs or tank buffs.  All in all, what that says is that the Druid Community has a "Swiss Army Knife" mentality.<br>
<br>
The short version is that we're not going to get upgrades to everything.  The one deciding push that got druids the healing changes that they have now (and most likely the change to moonfire) is that the same opinions were voiced uniformly by 98% of the druid population.  Right now other than a generic, "We can't do anything" attitude, there's no solid rallying cry.  <br>
<br>
Since no one can even seem to generate a topic that even 90% of the community can agree on, what that tells me is that the druid is an average class that is not "broken."  Therefore I doubt the need for the expedience for the "fix us before everyone" cry that's been voiced so much recently. <p><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#CCCCCC">

I'm sure as hell not going to nuke on encounters like the Emperor or mobs in VT at the start, at least not until we have the mob down pat and I can afford some extra fun.<br>
<br>
It's also dependent on what you define as a major raid as well.  I don't consinder AL/Creator/THO rhag 1 or rhag 2 major raids anymore.  Hell even the Blood of Ssra, isn't that tuff.<br>
<br>
------Enough about clerics.<br>
<br>
As far as being a druid in the high end scene, druids can contribute a lot.  A smart druid isn't going to be nuking like a wizard till oom, that druid will find a balance between nuking and healing their group.<br>
<br>
In long duration fights like the Cursed for example, 1 druid can dish out about 70-80k in DoT damage in a period of 20 minutes.  Granted a necromancer can deal about 160k in DoT damage in the same period of time, but 80k for one druid, that's not shabby at all.  With my mana regen, I'm always fm by the time I need to refresh WD or Breath of Ro.  I can even throw in a moonfire between rounds with the extend affliction focus item, adding about another 15k in damage without going below 80m.  Add in Mind wrack I can nuke twice as much more, and maintain dotting and still maintain 80m.  <br>
Spread the dots around, 2-3 druids can average 60k of damage this fight.  Add in the amount of healing mana I have left to assist heal as needed, I'm golden.<br>
<br>
If your not finding the role you want in a guild, blame yourself or the guild for that.  Granted there are a few tweaks here and there, but a druid can offer so much more then what many of you are saying we don't offer.  <br>
<br>
Your only as useful as you believe yourself to be, and I'm damn more useful then a cleric that just clicks a button after counting a few seconds and my guild knows it.  A trained monkey can do that.  <br>
<br>
At the start of the Druid petition we had here I agreed with a lot of the things, but now, I don't agree with many of the things we wanted.<br>
<br>
Just like many necromancers attitudes that all they are there for are to corpse summon and mana feed.  Heh, none of our necromancers mana feed on a raid aside from Mindwracking.  Our necromancers know they can do a lot more to contribute to a raid then just mana feed.  They can heal, they can deal damage.   <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=142925>~Aerillea Mystfyre~</a>

I know for a fact that a well equipped warrior can far excede that damage output. So, bringing a rogue or monk will increase the damage output far more than bringing the dotting druid. Of course, our dots aren't stackable, so a single druid can do the dotting duties. If you spread them around to three druids, that is a massive 13 dps.<br>
<br>
Druid nukes are pretty good. Mana wise, Moonfire is on par with the top of the line wizard Kunark nukes. Not a problem here, but if you really want the long term dps, wizards are still better and another melee is even better in most cases.<br>
<br>
It is mainly the healing role (one that is often expected from us) that we fall flat. If a raid needs backup healers, they are better off with a level 52 cleric than a level 60 druid. There is just no comparison. I can go lom very quickly just trying to heal a warrior taking riposte damage using a big slow two hander. I know this for a fact since I am grouped with a warrior at every raid I attend.<br>

I'm sorry, it doesn't take much more then a bot to maintain a CH rotation.  <br>
<br>
Now if your talking about a true cleric that's versatile for many types of group and situations, we are at the same level.  I'm talking abotu a cleric that not only heals, but crowd controls too, stuns, roots and knows when a nuke is necessary.  But that's based on skill, not class at all.  One of the fears of many clerics is that they can be easily replaced by bots, in some cases that's true if they don't know anything about their class.  <br>
<br>
If your melees are taking RIPOSTE damage, then tell the IDIOTS to hit the mob from behind, not front.  If its a tank that's going to be maintanking then he's going to need a cleric just in case or communicate to the other healers that he needs heals to top him off.  CH rotation takes it from there.<br>
<br>
The only advantage a level 52 cleric has over a 60 druid in a healing situation is CH.  But if your melees are that stupid to be taking riposte damage consistently, then CH is obviously needed.   The only time melees in my guild other then the main tank takes damage are from those silly curses and ae's in Luclin.<br>
<br>
Using a combination of Winged Death, Breath of Ro, Drones of Doom from Bracer, and Choking Spores on a engaged or rooted mob, my dot damage is around, lets see:<br>

You're even wrong about the penalty, by the way.  It's a 33% penalty.

Take all away but one and see if your guild can still do the raid. Assuming a good cleric turnout, I am sure you not being there won't effect them one bit. Now lets assume you need a six cleric rotation and only five clerics show up. That one missing ch rotation cleric can bring the raid to a halt. You can do a raid with one druid (or even none), but you cant do it without ch rotation clerics.<br>
<br>
Sorry you think I am an idiot, but warriors in 99% of the cases fight from the front of the mob. If not and the first warrior goes down, the mob will spin around and hit everyone with riposte damage. It will also lower every melee's dps until you get the mob turned back around. Also, in many cases, the warrior will be out of ch range if they are behind the target. That guarentees that many melee will die and quite possibly a raid failure due to the lack of a proper switch. Then there are non rooted mobs. How do you think you can control mob positioning if everyone is behind the mob? Once again it is the warriors who have to take up the slack in front of the mob so that the rogues can do their thing from the back. So, you see, warriors aren't stupid for taking riposte damage, sometimes they have to do it in order to insure the success of the raid (and I bet you thought they hit attack and went outside for a smoke break).<br>
<br>
You made a nice dot list, and if a druid had all the proper equipment then they might have a decent dps (still not that high though). But once again, a single druid can do it. There is no stackability with dots, so no reason to bring more than one druid other than nuking or healing. As for wizards, they can sit to regen mana, or they can stand there with kei, ft items, and bard song working while they maintain a steady 40+ dps with items like the robe off of velketor. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustormhaven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormhaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/19/02 5:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27643.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web2.airmail.net/naomi/amalgam/forum/stormhaven.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stop complaining</span><hr size=1> <i>I believe I am more useful then a standard CH rotation cleric.

<br>
This can be negated by saying the following:<br>
If you have no clerics, you have no raid.<br>
If you have no druids, you still have a raid.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter how useful you feel in a raid - you may be the raid organizer, the group god, the loot distributor, the tactical advisor.  That's all about you and what you do for your raid/guild.  The question at hand is how useful is a druid at a raid event.  Usually, the answer is that druids are nice to have around, but we are by no means needed or necessary.  Whether a cleric can be replaced by a bot or a script is irrelevant, the fact is that they are required in order for the raid to take place.<br>
<br>
<i>The only advantage a level 52 cleric has over a 60 druid in a healing situation is CH. </i><br>
<br>
Ok, but that's a hell of an advantage.  That's almost like saying someone standing 100 miles away with a nuclear warhead doesn't have much of an advantage versus another person standing on an open street with a 9mm.<br>
<br>
<i>The only time melees in my guild other then the main tank takes damage are from those silly curses and ae's in Luclin.</i><br>
<br>
Your guild not fight many mobs with Rampage?<br>
Even with a well sorted tanking order, rampage's hate list is dynamic and changes from moment to moment (as people step outside of the range, aggro is increased, etc).  A tank taking two rampages can easily have their total hp cut in half (or worse).  A well timed CB can be the difference between that tank living or dipping into the "low hp" aggro zone and getting eaten.<br>
<br>
<i>Over with 1 druid versus 1 wizard, in lets say a 40 minute battle, that one druids [DOT] DPS is larger then 1 wizard who will have to either med to regain mana or use click robes to continus his dps.</i><br>
<br>
Couple of things - <br>
In order to get an accurate dps read out for DoTs, you'd have to do quite a few tests in order to get a meaningful number.  The dps you've got calculated there are best case scenarios - no fizzles, no resists.  I've found that counting on BoR for any amount of dps is pretty iffy due to it's high resist and fizzle factor.  If you're using DoD from an armor piece, that's 10s for casting, so you've got about 30s to sit and med in that scenario.  Now, I'm sure this is guild/server specific, but we don't have many high level bards on our server, so getting AE manasong is not an assured thing.  Usually there's one bard, and more than likely, he's in the damage shield group.  What's your mana usage look like if you keep that up in the Cursed fight, or any other 30+ min fight, without a bard?  <br>
<br>
I'm also assuming that you're having someone else debuff fire (or you're running in and debuffing, then waiting to lose aggro).  I know BoR doesn't like sticking on 90% of the Luclin mobs without Smolder/Sunder (even with malo already on).  <br>
<br>
Second - you're dps of the wizards is a bit flawed.  First off, in a raid if you're DoT'ing using all four of those DoTs, you've just bumped up your own personal dps.  However, what are you having the other druids doing?  Moonfire/Wildfire?  Compare the average dps of four wizards versus four druids in the same situation.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs to remember that when calculating dps on spells, you can't just go by what the spellbook says you can do.  Resists are a very big factor.  Tanks can calculate their dps by running their logs through parsers - they can see that they did from 0 to 300+ damage on hits, and average that out.  You cannot assume that moonfire will always do 1150 to a target and say that your dps is XX_amount based on that calculation. <p><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#CCCCCC">

You are comparing a moonfire druid to an epic rogue. Well, I don't know how your guild works, but in my guild I don't think we have a single main rogue using their epic as a main hand weapon, and most have their epics banked. On the other hand, less than half our druids have moonfire and only one has mask of the stalker (which seems to be extremely rare on our server as a whole). I believe we actually have as many wizzards with Elnerick's Electrical Rending as druids with Moonfire (ya, crappy luck with the spell drops). For most mobs I have seen, our rogues tend to be well up in the 100dps range and even quite a bit higher on some of them. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaerillea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerillea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/19/02 5:41:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27643.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stop complaining</span><hr size=1> Sorry, Rampage can be controlled.  We've been able to control Rampage on almost all luclin boss mobs we've encountered except one and thats largely due to not getting enough shots at it to learn how.<br>
<br>
As far as needing clerics for a raid, hence thats where the bot comes into play.  Practically anyone in the guild can log on a cleric and count and press a button.  If you call that a feature of a class, more the pity.  It's DEMEANING circled about 1 silly spell.<br>
<br>
Resistance rates fall the same for a wizard.  You calculate max damage for a wizard too and compare that, resist rates are random, but can not affect the total possible output.<br>
<br>
As far as debuffing, if I need to debuff, what do I lose? 1 minute of DPS and I'll have all my mana back.<br>
<br>
Again if one druid is dedicated to dotting, it'd be one with low mana regen to do it.  Leaving the other druids to dd.  Druids can output some pretty good DPS.<br>
<br>
Of course there are situations where there may not be enough bards or maybe even necro's then you adjust.  When we don't have a primary bard on, someone will log one on to bot.<br>
<br>
As far as melee's taking riposte damage still, ok, warriors will take front riposte damage if they are hoping to main tank, but in most fights main tank switching is never needed.  Again, if the warrior is going to die and isn't primary tanking, that melee needs to turn attack off, back away to a wall and ask for a CH.<br>

Many of us probably wish we were in a guild like yours that is so overflowing with clerics that druids don't have to resort to healing, but most guilds want druids to heal. And it is the healing area that we fall flat.
