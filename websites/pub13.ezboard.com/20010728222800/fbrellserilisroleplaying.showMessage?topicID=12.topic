Zephire drank deeply, tipping his head back and letting the almost frigid water dribble down his face and neck, and doing so revealed the deep red war berries hanging from the dark Ironwood tree.  &quot;Perfect!  Tunare is indeed with me on this hunt.&quot;  Smiling now he gathered some togeather and slowly sang the song taught to him by his father, a rythmic chant that called upon the land for power and protection, and crushed the berries to form the deep blood colored face paint of a Ranger about kill.  Still sensing the Orcs through the foliage, and knowing it would be many hours yet before the sun set and they would travel, Zephire felt he had time to honor his ancestors and call to the forest for protection.<br>
  While doing this he thought on his prey.  A duo of Orcs traveling swiftly from the borders of Kelethin.  In their spore Zephire traced accents from Felwith, a days travel along a well used highway from the main lift.  Zephire wondered indeed what these two would be doing so deep into Elven territory.<br>
  A sharp snap of breaking branch brought him instantly into focus, spinning round and drawing the long blood knife from it's worn sheath.  But the action was never completed, and the knife fell to the ground as Zephire's world went black with the impact of something cruel and heavy against the side of his head. <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uzephire.showPublicProfile>Zephire</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 3/23/00 3:19:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uaeani.showPublicProfile>Aeani</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalRainbow.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of Brell</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(3/21/00 2:24:18 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.teleport.com/~ggarren/aeani.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Prelude to a Sentinel</span><hr size=1> Ouch.

Has anyone seen any EQ books?  I see all these d&amp;d, mechwarrior, shadowrun books, but no EQ.  I think that's why I started this story in the first place.<br>

Biting down pain, Zephire composed himself and took measure of his situation.  Only a week before his entry to adulthood, he was remarkably adept at woodcraft and overcoming physical hardship to endure under harsh environs and situations.  Though this was definately the most ardurous he had faced to date, he was able to gain a semblence of composure.  He could smell the Orcs near him, and something else. A sickly sweet ordor intermingled with the harsh stink of the Orcs and their victules, hardly worth being called carrion by Elven standards.  The new smell was musky and faint, which had a facet of something familiar yet twisted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kroongth!  Ung kra da!&quot; And with that Zephire was yanked savagly to a sitting position by rough and horny Orc talons, thick and jagged nails biting into his flesh.  Almost passing out from the pain of sudden movement, a hard swing caught him in the chin dazzing him and bringing blackness to bear again.  But total blackness didn't come to him.  He was again hauled to a sitting position as an Orc grabbed his face and sqeezed on Zephires jaw muscles forcing his mouth open.  Foul and burning liquid was sloshed down his throat, immediately causing his eyes to water and face to flush.<br>
<br>
&quot;There.&quot; Zephire whipped his head to the left in surprise at hearing civil Elven tounge spoken, to be rewarded by yet another flash of pain in his head.  &quot;Dargth en choten wig.&quot; said the cultured voice, and more liquid was forced down Zephire's gullut.  Recoving from his latest attempted drowning, Zephire heard light, firm footfalls circle him from left to right.  &quot;You're quite lucky I showed when I did little forest mouse.  These fellows here were quite interested in consuming you to break the day fast.&quot;  Zephire surveyed the &quot;fellows&quot; Not two Orcs anymore, but 5.  Two huge in comparison to the others, and not of a cut that Zephire had seen before on the previous Orcs he hunted on the borders to Kelethin.  Huge did them a disservice (if such a thing could be done to an Orc), with black mail upon their breasts and well honed swords at their sides.  Each wore a bright steel helm with the image of a snarling Orc face painted on its crest.  Rivaling Zephire in height and build these two were clearly some higher form of Orc he had never come across or heard of.  They eyed him with a cool easiness of a wolf who knows without a doubt the rabbits leg is broken.  Zephire tried not to look like a rabbit.<br>
<br>
The cultured voice spoke again. &quot;But what I need from you won't take many breaths, and they will still have time to prepare you for their midnight rations.&quot;  A small laughter, almost childlike, broke from the voice.  Zephire was overwhelmed as the voice dipped near him and stiffled him with the sickly sweet smell Zephire could not discren earlier. Turning slightly he caught sight of who the voice belonged to, and would have leapt clean to the Butcher Block pass had he not been bound.  He only succeeded in launching a couple of feet into the air with fright and crashing to the ground, hitting his head on the exact spot as his previous injury.  Quickly the darkness enveloped him, but not so fast that one word registered and was spat from his lips in a shill cry, &quot;Drow!&quot;  <p></p><i>Edited by <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uzephire.showPublicProfile>Zephire</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 3/23/00 3:33:47 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=4.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
