You talk about a guild rejoining a list, but don't address an alliance.  Personally, I'd make them post the 18 again, but it's up to you.<br><br>2. You have listed guilds which will not be allowed on the list due to perceived levels of membership.  You may wish to state under what conditions you will be removing guilds, in the future, who can currently fight Vox/Naggy, and how they might appeal it.<br><br>3. I've never run a message board before, but requiring a small guild to create one might be a little excessive.  If I ran a small guild of under 20 members and planned to keep it small, I'd mostly just handle issues in-game and through emails; but that's just my style.  Plus, having a board can mean very little.  Someone could throw one up quick and have it just be a front.<br><br>I'd suggest that if you see a guild tag in game, that should be enough.  If Verant can recognize it as a guild, don't see why the reservation system can't.  Not sure what you are trying to prevent with this limitation.<br><br>Everything else looks good.

You play that alt alot as you also play your main. Why should your alt not be allowed to do its thing independently of the main?<br><br>A real for instance ( not to mention names ) is a mid 50's Necro in one guild with a low 50's ( dragon level ) Paladin Alt in another guild. I think the Paladin should be counted toward the 18.<br><br>Also there are alot of guilds that are bringing up alts as their mains reach the upper 50's. Why should these alts be penalized in their chances at early Dragon loot with their guilds?<br><br>With Naggy all you NEED is 4 groups and with Vox 5. Recommended is one more group for each. By forcing the up and coming Alts out and forcing the equivilent of 18 early non-duplicate sign-ups for each raid, aren't you hurting the chances of Indies, Alts and Power Dragon Raiders ( like me ) from being able to be involved in Old World Dragon Raids?<br><br>To say to me &quot;just level up and do Gore&quot; is trying to tell me how to play the game. That is just wrong. I feel I have a better chance at a Vox Book than I would have at a Gore book, both because of the orginization of Vox reservations and the drop rates of the book between the two dragons.<br><br>Note: These are my personal opinions and not that of my guild or guild leadership.<br><br>Krungle<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's Man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 617<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 8:57:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Vox/Nagafen rules posted and effective immediately.</span><hr size=1> Sorry, you're just wrong Krungle. Making those changes defeats the purpose of what Twiggie is trying to do by letting the exploiters right back in. <br><br>Verant made a level limit on vox and nag to keep higher levels from farming em. While I'm normally an FCFS advocate, I'm willing to accept that didn't mean they just wanted you to level up an appropriate alt so you could keep farming it. They wanted to cut out a niche for the lower level dragon raider. <br><br>If you want a vox/nag rotation that actually serves people wanting to do this with thier main character, you have to cut out the alts.

They have the wisdom, experience and patience to try to make everything run smoothly and fairly on the server.  I salute them all.  My question is what exploits they felt was happening before these new guidelines were instituted?<br><br>As a frequent Naggy raider in need of the elusive red scale for my epic, I enjoyed attending the raids run my guilds w some higher level dragon raiding experience.  These guilds ran efficient, effective raids and by doing so taught the low level raider in attendance quite a bit about raiding on a larger scale.  I also do not attend raids where I dont agree w the loot policies - specifically claiming of more than one item on a raid not counting duplicates - and those older guilds that I raided w were not doing this.  However I do understand that some of these guilds might have been exploiting the loot drops.<br><br>I have also attended the raids run by some of the younger guilds and feel that they, for the most part, are a great learning experience for both the raid leaders and those in attendance.  It might take a little longer to drop the dragons and there might be a few more corpses on the ground at the end of the battle, but I have yet to attend a Naggy raid w a guild I would not join for a second Naggy raid.<br><br>With the new requirements to lead a Naggy raid, what guilds will still be able to run a Naggy raid?  I dont imagine the same guilds will be interested in running these raids month after month.  As you know, leadin raids is a very taxing experience to most.  I am certainly not saying that the smaller younger guilds are not capable of running excellent dragon raids.  I personally enjoyed the mix of young and old guilds we had w the previous requirements.  As I said, the more knowledgable guilds running Naggy raids help to educate younger raiders.  The more knowledgable the raiders on our server, the stronger our server becomes.  <br><br>My fears...that a lack of guilds able to meet the requirements will cause these dragons to become FCFS.  I know that many of you think this would work well at the current state of our server.  I need the red scale to complete my epic but dont want to be camped in Sol B for the rest of my days watching for someone leading a raid - then hoping I get chosen to attend.  I enjoy the use of the sign ups where raiders can chose to attend or not depending on the time/date/loot rules.  At the same time, speaking as a frquent raid leader, it is nice to be able to pick your raiders from a posted list, helping to insure you have the strenght of raid before moving to the raiding location.<br><br>I realize that there are dragons other than Naggy that drop the scale that I need.

There are many guilds in the inbetween stages in level.  Our guild is one of them.

I think it's funny that they would be forced on the lower levels now /laugh when the upper levels rejected them before.

Taking a plan from adun that was unpopular and shoving it down the younger folks/guilds throat telling them either follow it or *smugly* don't is by far a low one.

I do not know what goes through everyone's heads, I just know you have some list up there excluding about half of their guild from ever hosting a vox/naggy raid again.  Trak list is going to be going away and now you have left exemplar with no option of ever getting on the lower level dragons where quite a few of their players are at.  There are actually several guilds that are &quot;caught in the middle&quot; with their levels in their guild.  There are several on that list of trak that require outside help.  Not all of us want to have 60+ folks in the guild but would like a shot at it once in awhile.  It's all mute anyway since trak will be gone.  But to leave a permanent list of folks who aren't hardcore dragon raiders off of something that most of the age group that their folks are around that can truly benefit because some of their high level players would just like to try a trak raid..is just wrong.  <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  a. Exceptions can be made, but not guaranteed, in the event of a massive guild restructuring that has greatly reduced the guilds high level strength and membership base.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <br>And the rules clearly take that into account.<br></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>And this is what you call clear?  If you can mess up the original list that bad, it makes me wonder how messed up your &quot;criteria&quot; would be for judging folks who are allowed in this &quot;exception&quot;.  After seeing this silly plan of adun's being pushed on the lower level crowd that the high levels scoffed at for something on thier own rotation, I don't have much trust right now in your judgement.  Something is skewed somewhere I just don't know when it happened.<br><br>Also a note, not every &quot;alliance&quot; yields what some other &quot;alliance's&quot; yield.  The term alliance is thrown around very loosely and what it means to one, it doesn't mean that to another.  Some of you think just because people are allied they are going to make up the entire raid.  Maybe in the case of the planes where the levels that can go can range from 46 to 60.  It is a much different story when you are dealing with guilds that span from 40 to 60 in levels..and try to get their 55+'s in on a raid.  We all dont' have these &quot;uber&quot; alliances where we all go jumping to kill things.  Well maybe that is true for some guilds but clearly not for others that aren't &quot;hard core&quot; raiders.  So to even put the &quot;alliances&quot; in the same category with an uber &quot;alliance&quot; is just downright silly.  Should those guilds be penalized from signing up?  Absolutely not.<br><br><br>I stand by my original post.  This smells and it is obvious why a vote wasn't done.  Please stop playing the sympathy card that you are dammed if you do and dammed if you don't and that is why you are implementing this.  The crap you got from what BI did was not because you addressed an abuse, they missed their sign up in black and white.

Go way back, I recall your best reason for not liking what was proposed for VS was that Eddee approved of the idea, and you thought that anything Eddee liked was obviously evil.<br><br>The intent of the rotation system is to allow people in the Nag/Vox level range to have a forum to plan dragon raids ahead of time, sharing equally with their peers.  The goal is to allow those people a more &quot;friendly&quot; environment than other servers.<br><br>Jaradis' put a lot of time &amp; work into making the rules because he cares about the server, and wants things to be best they can.  The reservation system isn't in place to allow guilds past Nag/Vox to farm it for themselves in an organized manner.  Presently, there are guilds doing that.<br><br>Whether or not Exemplar is a guild that is past Nag/Vox level isn't the issue here.  If they are, they should move on to other dragons, and stop taking resources from the people that are supposed to have them.  If they're not yet at the point where they can take on the other dragons, then it's a simple matter for their guild leadership to speak to Jaradis, &amp; clear things up.<br><br>The rules here aren't in place to deny people access to something they should have.  The ultimate goal of the reservation is to best help the 45-52 crowd.  I'd venture that Watchers could probably kill both Nagafen &amp; Vox, simply using alts.  That doesn't mean we should be on the rotation.  We have access to better sources of dragon type items, and shouldn't be taking them away from the people that legitimately need them.<br><br>If you really care about Brell, instead of just dismissing this as an evil &amp; wrong change, talk specifically about the problems with these rules, and offer suggestions on how to make them better.<br><br>Simply saying you hate it simply because I like it doesn't cut it.  Saying it's open to abuse doesn't work either.  Look at our present system.  Hello abuse.  Again, if you really care, be constructive.  Help us build the best damn reservation system out there. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9228"><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/adun/Adune.jpg" width="381" height="175"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukulanaesoulsease.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulanae Soulsease</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 859<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 2:30:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://web1.noment.com/dsummers//EQ/Kulanae6.gif height=158 width=119></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Vox/Nagafen rules posted and effective immediately.</span><hr size=1> You might want to edit the link to the new rules Jara.

If I have a charactor, main or alt, the right level to raid Naggy and Vox, why should they not be counted?<br><br>That alt would want to raid it for itself, not for my Main. Sure, I have seen people say &quot;Take my alt so I can roll for my Main&quot; and I think those people should be left out and not taken. But why should a few bad apples make it hard for my alts to get the scales or what nots they want from the Old World Dragons? I have a Bard that was coming up and will come up after I work more on my Monk. My Bard will want Horns and Drums from those Dragons if not the scales.
