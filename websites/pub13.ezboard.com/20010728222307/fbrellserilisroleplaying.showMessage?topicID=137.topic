The air was stale and waxy from the burning candle.  The flame was low and the candle near extinction.  Cerres berated herself for having waited so long.    The first few weeks after closing the house, Cerres had hurried back every three nights to relight the candle for Cyris.  She would sit at the empty window sometimes forgetting to return until morning.  This time she had waited a week and only reluctantly come.  She quickly replaced the candle, counted the inventory, determined she did not yet need to buy more, and left.  She turned down the path toward home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres jumped, startled at the sound of a  man's voice.  &quot;Serda!  What are you doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're not easy to find, you know.&quot;  Serda responded.  &quot;It took a week just to find out your name and then I had the hardest time finding your house.  I fell out of the trees three times.  How can you live up here?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres laughed.  &quot;I guess you have to be born here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I've been waiting every night since hoping to catch you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres looked at Serda puzzled.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To retrieve my heart.  You stole it when we met.&quot;  Serda smiled.<br>
<br>
Cerres found herself speechless for, perhaps, the first time in her life.  So he hadn't been joking the night they met when he told his friend &quot;She's mine.&quot;  Cerres had liked the sound of it, but so much had happened and now she didn't know what to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to show you something.&quot;  Serda said and he handed her a small gem.  Light reflected off every face.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's beautiful&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's beauty pales compared to yours.  Keep it, as a present.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I, uh, thank you.&quot;  Cerres stumbled over her own tongue, blushing, embarassed and terribly  confused.  <br>
<br>
Serda smiled.  &quot;Come with me to watch the sunrise.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Please.  I want to see your reflection in the moonlight.  And we can sit together as a new day dawns.&quot;  Serda held out his hand to escort her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Race you!&quot;  Cerres said deftly running across the bridge, laughing.  <br>
<br>
Serda shouted &quot;Hey&quot; and tried to catch up.  Cerres stopped laughing when she heard a thud and Serda grunting  &quot;Ooooph!&quot;   Cerres ran quickly to the forest floor, deflty leaping from platform to platform.  She got to Serda sitting on his bottom, wiping the grass off his  sleeve.  The consternation on his face sent ripples of laughter through her.  She giggled and turned to run on.  Serda rose slowly and yelled after her &quot;That's okay.  Don't worry about me.  I'll be fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres paused briefly and turned back to watch him chase her.   She thought his ego was probably more bruised than his body.  &quot;Okay, I won't!&quot; she yelled back and started off again, running a little slowly to allow him to shorten her lead.<br>
<br>
Cerres was sitting peacfully watching the ocean, not even winded when Serda caught up, breathing heavily. &quot;I'm too old to keep up with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres giggled.  &quot;You're not that old.  Well, okay, you're kind of old.  But, Daddy is older and he can keep up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Serda's face dropped.  &quot;I'm sorry about your father.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Solemnity rolled in with the tide. &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two sat silently, the waves of the ocean crashing into the shore carried the conversation for them.  Serda reached out to touch Cerres face and withdrew his hand prematurely.  He moved closer to her and contented himself with memorizing her features, profiled in the moonlight as she stared out to sea.  The smell of tree roses mixed with saltwater engraved itself in his memory.    With the keen eye of a ranger, he tracked the path of her thoughts without disturbing them.<br>
<br>
As the horizon lightened a procession of pink clouds billowed toward the shore, heralding the arrival of the new day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look,&quot;  Cerres pointed.  &quot;Isn't it beautiful?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not taking his eyes off of her, Serda answered.  &quot;Yes, it is.  The most beautiful thing I've ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres reached out, took Serda's hand and held it gently.  They sat until the sun was well into the sky.  Serda patted her hand and stood.  &quot;I fear the day is upon us and I have duties to fulfill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres smiled.  &quot;As do I.  But thank you for the sunrise.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I ordered it just for you,&quot; Serda smiled, bowed his head and left.  After he had gone Cerres realized she hadn't told him where she was living.  She ran after him but when she came to the crossroads, she had no idea which way he'd gone.   With a pleasant sigh, Cerres turned down the road to the Academy.  She didn't even notice that she was late. <p>Cerres Swiftfyre <BR>
