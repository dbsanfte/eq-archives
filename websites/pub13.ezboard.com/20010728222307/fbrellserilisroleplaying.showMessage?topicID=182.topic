8 years ago<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know what I was thinking really. How could I have fallen in love and married a Woodelf? It was folly of the highest order. Yet somehow we both knew we were meant for each other. We met again last night we met in Cazic Thule on the steps of the temple where he first proposed to me. I remembered why I loved him so. He killed two of the guards for me so we could sneak up on the temple steps and watch the night sky. We sat there all night and talked. I wanted to tell him then and it would have been the perfect time but I could not bring myself to do it. I know how much he wants this and if it does not work well he would be… &quot;<br>
<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>
<br>
Pphh phhh phhh <br>
<br>
&quot;That's it dear breath&quot;, said  Opala, the beautiful High Elf Midwife. &quot;Breath it will all be over soon&quot;<br>
<br>
I breathed, I cried, I screamed and I prayed. I was sure that it was all for nothing because it was impossible this birth was not supposed to happen. Then the vision came to me. It was I think Tunare or my twisted image of what Tunare may look like. I really don't follow the religious ways I have kept myself to Tinkering with gears and grease and I have not had time for all that nonsense. But she got my attention. In the delirium of my pain I heard her. She said &quot;WENSHADOW Name the child Wenshadow. She will be alone in the world yet will be the same as one other. She will show you the Truth you have always sought. Show her the stars and share your dreams with her. She is Norraths only hope. Norraths only hope Wenlily, Remember Tandon he gave up everything for you and for this child.&quot; Then she held up the Tandon's Diary in one hand and Tandon's sword in the other. Then she was gone.<br>
<br>
Tandon my first love. How could this have anything to do with Tandon? The memories came flooding back to me. The first time we met in Ak'anon. How he swept me off my feet! We traveled all the way to High hold Pass and there, on a bridge he asked me to marry him. He wanted a wedding there at inn by the falls. We started to plan it but something came over me. First I told him I was to young and that I should wait. I said that I had to explore the world first. Then I told him I didn't think I would ever marry and that is how I felt at the time. Yet I loved him with all my heart. And the black dress he gave me I still keep folded neatly in my chest. After that we drifted apart. I heard word of him from time to time. Then the letter from the rouge came to me aboard the ship I was taking from Butcher Block to Freeport. The man I knew to be Tandons trusted servant gave me a letter from Tandon's father. Tandon was dead. I cried for weeks. So much I wanted to say and I just wanted to hold his hand again and laugh. I began to use the barbarian male and his love of the kilt as a way to forget him. Time went on and I found my guild. They became my family and I forgot about Tandon or tried to. Then a few days after my wedding, as I was traveling the road in Oasis, a man whose face was hidden from me in the shadows jumped out at me. He blocked my path and snarled at me. &quot;How could you!&quot;  &quot;How could you marry him and he is a woodelf too!&quot; He spit on the ground by my feet. &quot;How could you deny our love? I have waited for you faithfully. I endured the rumors of your folly with Barbarians. Then I read this! &quot;He threw down the announcement of my marriage. &quot;Not even a word to me! You swore you would never marry!&quot;  I backed up slowly and said, &quot; &quot;who are you that you need to be given word or my wedding!&quot; I prepared to call my pet but I was afraid this man would over power me before I could summon it. &quot;You cruel bitch!&quot;  &quot;I will not live on this earth anymore not that you will care.&quot; &quot;Why don't you just throw a rain of swords down on me now and end it for me quickly so that I don't have to hide my tear stained face?&quot;  He ripped off his hood and there in front of me was Tandon. I screamed and then I felt a wave of nausea rack my body and I fainted.  I woke up and we were near the ocean he was caressing my face with water. He looked deep into my eyes and said you know I could never love anyone else. I started to cry. &quot;Tandon, you.. I was told many years ago you were dead.&quot; He looked at me puzzled. &quot;Who spread these lies?&quot; Bertran your servant came to me with a message from your father that you had been killed Karana two weeks past. I could not go to the funeral but I believed it to be true. Why would he lie about his only son and heir. &quot;I just today stepped of this barge from Kunark. I have been there for years I was one of the first to discover the place. My servants knew this …. But well Bertran… I see the treachery now.&quot;  &quot; He looked down at me and sighed. Do you love him then?&quot; &quot;Yes &quot; I said, &quot;with all my heart.&quot;  &quot;Then I will go. I am sorry for my harsh words before.&quot; He started to get up. &quot;Tandon&quot; I grabbed his arm &quot; I loved you too. Please forgive me&quot;  &quot;It is not your fault. Perhaps I really am dead. He shook off my hand and pulled his hood over his face. &quot;I need to be alone now. I will write to you. Trust only Sertas. He will carry my message.&quot; He got up quickly and ran off before I could even stand he was gone. <br>
<br>
The letters that followed that meeting were sad and wretched. He said that he had lost interest in his sword because he fought for me alone and now his sword was heavy. He said that my marriage had cut his heart out. He rationalized why he felt he should kill himself. I sent many letters to him imploring him to see that his family needed him and that in time he would see things differently. He wrote back saying that I alone was his reason for being. And that one day I would see that. He swore that he would fight only for me and for nothing else. His father be dammed. In the last letter I got from him he said that he had a mission to go on and that he would be out of touch for a while. It was short and blunt like that<br>
. <br>
<br>
Dear mommy,<br>
<br>
 I have not seen you in a very long time and you know I have never met daddy. I am 8 now and I can travel alone. I would like to try to come to the Truthbringer meeting this weekend to meet Daddy and all your friends. Don't worry I will dress in the appropriate Gnome attire. My brother will not attend as he is again in trouble with the law.<br>
<br>
All my love,<br>
<br>
Wenshadow<br>
