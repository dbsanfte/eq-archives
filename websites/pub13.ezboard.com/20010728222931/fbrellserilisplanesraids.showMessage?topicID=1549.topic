Perhaps you missed the conversation we had in the VS raid discussion area regarding my raid (a week or two ago).<br>
<br>
I've been an independent for over a year (ever since Volatilis Letum broke up).  I signed up for Venril Sathir in November, just prior to the exploding of the list, but still had to wait for over 5 months to be able to raid.  <br>
<br>
Over the course of those five months (and admittedly somewhat before then as well), I began raiding more and more with SR, SR absorbed some of my friends, and I've been invited on more things.  Consequently, when my turn to raid came around, I did two things.  First, I invited friends of mine, MANY of whom are in SR.  Quite a number of which (Crelone, Bigmoth, Thaloc, Truedy, on and on) are NOT in SR.  I then extended an open invitation to other members of SR.  If a member of SR wanted to came, I would find them a slot.  Hell, they've invited me on plenty of raids where I wasn't &quot;needed&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I also invited a couple of people for loot only reasons.  I don't know Denadra or Futtwin at all, but they were recommended to me as 'good folk.'  When Kadeem couldn't make it, I invited Futtwin to come, just in case we were able to get the remains, and they'd nerfed multiquesting, I wanted two people who could use the stones to be there.  According to a friend of mine, Denadra was missing ONLY the wizard staff off of VS for her epic, so I invited her along.  Tarskin's been a friend for eons, so I also made sure to invite him as well.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty happy with who got what last night, other than the crazy server outages the raid would have gone off without a hitch.  Heck, we had easily 2x the number of people we needed, and VS lasted a sum total of probably 15 seconds, if that.  <br>
<br>
Take a look at who got what:<br>
<br>
Obidiah &lt;enshadowed&gt; -- pants<br>
Futtwin &lt;blood inferno&gt; -- pants<br>
Tarskin &lt;enshadowed&gt; -- wizzy staff (hopefully)<br>
<br>
Good thing this was just an SR raid passing itself off as Indy.  Whew, I was really worried about that.  =)<br>
<br>
One final point ... I can guarantee you that if I hadn't had all my friends in SR show up last night, I wouldn't have invited all of the people who gave me tells anyway.  Why should I?  I didn't need all of the people who were there as it was, but I wasn't going to turn down friends for lack of space.<br>
<br>
Actually, that's one of the philosophies I most like about SR... friends are always welcome.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day, and if you don't like who I invite on my raids, kiss my ass.  =)<br>

Yea, SR made out like banshees.<br>
<br>
I've been arguing to get independents off the Venril list since it started to become a problem.  Until that happens, we're gonna sign up for any Venril raid we're allowed to.  The term &quot;obvious&quot; should apply here.<br>
<br>
Similarly, when someone outside the guild asks for our help we're gonna go help them.  Apparently, Enshadowed and Abyss don't have a problem doing that either:<br>

Judging from your reply, it really sounds like you are protesting too much.  Way too much.  Guilty conscience maybe?  Was there any need for you to add that little rant on the end?<br>
<br>
The issue is not who got what, so don't try and make it out that way.  The issue is who went on the raid.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't really care who goes on what raid.  But if you all want to circumvent the intent of having Indy raids, then expect to be called on it.  Just don't have a raid that is so blatantly made up of one guild, and then try and pass it off as an &quot;Indy&quot; raid.  That's a naked lie, and it fools nobody.<br>

<br>
Having a qualification of 'don't take this personally...' in front of an attack makes it no less of an attack.  If you'd like to say that the current system is f'd up, that's fine, you'll be saying the same thing sooo many other people have said over and over again.  <br>
<br>
My raid, my invites, my rules.  Heck, I could have invited ONLY SR members, been the only independent, and it would still be within the spirit and intent of the rules (there are none).  <br>
<br>
I'm being serious now, not being a smartass.  If you would care to wait on the list for 5 months, you too can have the priviledge of inviting anyone you darn well please.<br>

Yeah, we've done it before and will do it again given the chance. You an indy that needs VS killed? shoot me a tell. Personally I don't really care that you guys did it.  I might deguild and put myself on the trakanon rotation soon, have my friends in Enshadowed help me kill him.<br>
<br>
After just sitting back and reading these forums for so long I know they wont bring about any change.  A vote when a moderator feels like it isn't a very good system and yet I can't think of anything better for the simple reason that boards like this aren't meant to exist, systems like this aren't meant to exist. <br>
<br>
On that, as an INDIVIDUAL I wont recognise fg reservations regardless of which way the vote falls and will just kill them whenever I feel like.<br>

As I could have told Leet if he'd asked, we've done about the same thing, may do so again in the future, and definitely support the right of anyone to bring whom they want on a raid.<br>
<br>
The rules are the rules; you followed them.  Anybody doesn't like it, change the rules.<br>
<br>
Ganon/Thoric/Nillon/Vumil: I won't offer an apology because Leet wasn't speaking for Enshadowed, otherwise...see my comments to Duffer above.  About the only statement of Leet's I agree with is &quot;this isn't about who got what.&quot;  :-)<br>
<br>
Adun:  An awful lot of individuals in Enshadowed <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>are</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> making up their own minds about the validity of the fire giant reservations.  Not much story I can tell beyond that.  <br>
<br>
Is the guild verbally supporting FCFS on the Fire Giants...yes, just check our votes.  Is the guild stating a new policy of FCFS on the Fire Giants...no.  Will the guild be judged by the actions of some of its members...almost certainly.  Anything beyond that is internal laundry at this point.<br>
<br>
Pharma:  You're just here to flame Raege, so I don't think you need any comments from me.<br>
<br>
Saphdia:  Despite being self-appointed Watchdog of Brell, you have long since forfeited any right to have me answer to you.  Your threats have been understood; have a nice day.<br>
<br>
Leet:  I understand your frustration with the silly state of affairs, bud.  However, I think you're really just stinging from the &quot;A question for Enshadowed&quot; thread about Fragged's Trakanon raid.  Looks like you've removed the original references to it, but...keep something in mind.  That thread had an agenda.  If it hadn't, then the fact that another guild <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>did</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> use that raid as an additional chance at Trakanon would have been &quot;discussed.&quot;  And, I guess we wouldn't have agreed--since I'd have supported them, too.<br>

It was a promise.  If you can't see that if enshadowed members deem it necessary to not abide by the rules that we agree on, then you will certainly fall into the realm of people not working with your guild or respecting it.  Just remember, the &quot;small, less powerful&quot; guilds of today, could beat you to the punch tomorrow.  Having a leader that doesn't come out and say much about their policy when some of their members have been making fcfs comments of screwing the system is bound to have problems and not from saphdia.<br>
<br>
So copeland, will we get some half assed apology now from enshadowed members on a continual basis because they overstepped reservations yet again.  Only time will tell.<br>
<br>

<br>
I completely concur with your basic premise... taking away the direct threats.  <br>
<br>
I also find it beyond disturbing that various board personages have stated their explicit intent to screw the current system... no matter what the popular mandate is...<br>
<br>
I also understand that the natural reaction for anyone is to start girding for a fight... I try and remember that several of the people making veiled comments ARE NOT the problem.<br>
<br>
I dont think Copeland or Ganon (since SR is getting flamed over somewhere else today), nor their guilds, should be accountable for the statements made in (most cases) pretty obvious frustration.  <br>
<br>
Another way of looking at it... attacking the moderates only strenthens the position you are not supporting.<br>

One question, what is it? Are the rules the rules, or are they only the rules when you want them to be?<br>
