<br>
Daarken, you are either completely insane or you are thinking of someone else.  Another option is that you are purposefully lying in a bizarre attempt to destroy my character somehow.  I say bizarre because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are the one that is coming off as a complete nutcase and damaging any sort of credibility you might ever have had.  I suspect that you are just resorting to these tactics because you can't beat me on the even field of a message board by using your own wits, so you're resorting to a VERY sleazy, cowardly and transparent tactic in an attempt to slant opinion in your favor in a very yellow-journalismish way.  (Ooooh I coined a new adverb!!  Yay!)<br>
<br>
I have never spoken to your wife, fiance, or whatever you want to call her <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>in game</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  Not once.  This I would solemnly swear in a court of law if it were to come to something as ridiculous as that. *raises his right hand and swears a solemn oath*<br>
<br>
The only time I have ever spoken to you, Daarken, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>in game</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> was to offer you a corpse-summons from my necro at the WL zone of Kael (you had been killed by Wuoshi, I think, and didn't have a coffin in the bank).  This occured *after* you originally threatened me the first time.  I was willing to forgive and forget.<br>
<br>
At the time, I told you (as my necro) that you weren't going to be happy when the coffin showed up, because I knew you held a grudge against Ean and, sure enough, as soon as I showed up bearing the coffin with Ean, you (predictably) refused the coffin that I offered to you completely free of charge.  I saw you in Neriak a good 2 hours after that, so I guess it took you a while to find a port (you wouldn't accept a port from me, either).<br>
<br>
That is the ONLY dealing I have ever had with you, Daarken, in the game of Everquest (no other contact with you in any other games or IRL, to my knowledge).  <br>
<br>
As far as the message boards are concerned, we've now engaged in a battle of &quot;wits&quot; on 2 separate occasions... the first was covered in my earlier post, and took place on the BS.net rant boards as well as the Whineplay forum (I bashed you for being a lazy whining moron in both cases).  Your &quot;wife/fiance&quot; became involved with this thread (the BS.net version), and that constituted my only involvement with her.  <br>
<br>
The second instance was started with <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm33.showMessage?topicID=3797.topic">this post</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> that I made on the BS.net boards and which got carried over to this thread by you.  Just check the time stamp of your last post on the Carnivore thread and the first post in this thread - you were obviously unsatisfied with your ability to strike back at me for &quot;chastising&quot; you in the Carnivore thread, so you tried a new tactic in this thread a few minutes later.  It's pretty painfully obvious, isn't it?  It is utterly transparent to me.<br>
<br>
As for your wife or fiance or whatever, I have had NO dealings with Allecto (assuming that is the correct name of whom you are referring to) outside of the confines of the Brell rants board before it was deleted and Jester made the new one.  I made one comment to her there, and it was referenced in an earlier post I made in this thread.  Not once have I ever spoken to her <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>in game</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, and only once have I addressed her on the message boards (besides the later post where I apologized for my &quot;STFU&quot; remark to her - you have conveniently forgotten about that too, I suppose.  I will admit that the apology was presented in a pretty insincere fashion, as I was still bashing on you, so I can somewhat understand the oversight). <br>
<br>
 I suggest you check your &quot;log&quot; again, sir, because you are 100% mistaken.  Don't bother posting your &quot;log&quot; either; although it would be extremely amusing to watch you attempt to put abusive words into my mouth, both you and I know that no such log really exists, and everyone else knows how easy logs are to fake.<br>
<br>
I say again that you are either insane, thinking of someone else, or maliciously lying.  There is no way you ran a log or spoke to a GM about me or that they spoke to me about it, simply because IT NEVER HAPPENED.  Verant *does* keep records, my good fellow... and guess what:  to the best of my knowledge, my record is spotless.  I'd welcome an inspection of my record by Verant or any other authorities of your choice, because I simply have nothing to fear.  In your words... &quot;bring it on&quot;.  Otherwise, in my words... &quot;STFU&quot;.<br>
<br>
Gonna quote you again, because this is an amusing point:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  i ran a log and reported those things. and even spoke to a gm about you and were told they had spoken to you as well.<br>
<br>
but since no one but you has access to the these records its just your word against mine.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
O....K..... so <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>you</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> ran a log, but <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>I</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> am the only one that has access to those &quot;records&quot;?!  That kinda makes sense -- if you're completely out of your mind, that is.  Next time you try to slander (libel... whatever) someone's game character -- which is kind of funny in itself, you might want to try and get your story straight before you post, and you'll [quite possibly] look like less of a crazed moron.<br>
<br>
You are a complete freak in any case.   I suspect from your comments that you are just looking for some attention in a pathetic and contemptible manner, and I want nothing further to do with it.  I am done with you and your posts -- now stop trying to spread lies and leave me the hell alone, please.  It's a pretty simple request by which I hope you can abide.  Can you understand that?  I'll word it more simply:  leave me alone.  Stop lying.  Leave me alone.  Please and thank you and all that.  Comprende?<br>
<br>
What it boils down to is this:  The people that know me know that you are lying, and the people that don't know me should easily have figured it out by now.  If they haven't, then screw 'em I guess, because I'm done defending myself against the rantings of a delusional dimwit on (of all things... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... for chrissakes!!) an Everquest message board.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of you, good night and good bye on this thread, gentle readers (yeah, so I used to read Miss Manners.  *puffs chest out and tries to look tough* Wanna make something of it?  Ermmm... did I mention that I'm only 16% ghey...?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
