Grrrr</span><hr size=1> Ok, I'll try and keep it short.<br>
Sunday. Kael raid. Long time in getting to Arena, and then even more delays. People have to leave, people joining, etc. I am in a group of 5, me as healer and 4 tanks. We then get a 48 or so Druid. Fine I think, he can nuke while I heal with Sup Heal (I'm level 52). Next giant comes along he SNARES!!!! I'm like, Man, don't snare it, there's a main snarer and snare is a lot of aggro so soon into the fight. No response. Next giant, he snares again. I repeat my comment and he says he's doing it for faction. Nuke I tell him. AFTER the giant is at half health, and maybe that way we can also start KSing, hehe :P<br>
Well, I dunno what he was doing next few fights, but he was definitely not nuking. Then there's a bad pull. One of my tanks begins taking a beating, so I heal. His health drops some more so I heal again... and get aggro of course. At this time I look at my group window and see the other druid is not in the same zone. WTF?? I say to myself. I am always permanently looking at Group window to see who's health drops a pixel and his definitely didn't. Well I get killed by the Protector of Zek and when I reappear at my bind the druid has disbanded from the group. I send him a tell: Did you gate?<br>
He responds: Yes, I had aggro so I gated.<br>
I'm thinking to myself: He had aggro? From doing WHAT? And he managed to pull off gate at level 48 with a Zek beating on him?? Does he think I'm stupid or what?<br>
I tell him: You DO NOT gate in the middle of a raid, and you DID NOT have aggro.<br>
- I had scrolled up my message window and saw just before I cast the second heal on my tank ' &quot;Druid&quot; begins to cast a spell' -<br>
I tell those in my group and they said they also thought they saw him gate.<br>
At that moment he sends me another tell: I didn't want to die so I gated. And it is dinner time anyway.<br>
Furious like hell I tell him if I ever see him on a raid again I will shout to the zone I will not raid with such a bad player and inform the raid leader it is him or me....<br>
&quot;Druid&quot; is not online at this moment.<br>
<br>
No comment.<br>
<br>
So when I finally get rezzed I tell all those at the raid what hapenned and that I will never raid with him again.<br>
<br>
What would you guys do?<br>
What do you think of this kind of behaviour?<br>
<br>
Just had to rant about it. He made me furious, and it's people like that that give us Dr00ds bad names.<br>

Did you die?<br>
No, I'm a Druid, I don't die, I just get chased a lot.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/3/01 5:53:59 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/lynxhead.jpg WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gating Druid... Grrrr</span><hr size=1> I wouldn't raid with him again.  I personally feel that all members of a raid have a responsibilty, and that is to keep raiders informed of your status, be it mana or allotted playing time.  He also should have been obedient to the raid leaders and organizers.  In this case, since you two were splitting up the chores, he should either adhere to his duties or tell you his intentions to do otherwise in advance.<br>
<br>
A raid is a team effort and if someone cannot follow orders or is not responsible enough to inform the raiding party that they must depart, you don't need them on the raid.  They are a liability, not an asset.  A raid depends on each individual who attends, and a person who gates in the middle of a battle without warning or instructions to do so is NOT dependable. <p><CENTER>

Grrrr</span><hr size=1> I tell you what &quot;gaters&quot; piss me off.<br>
I've had an experience recently..or rather my irl boyfriend has with a &quot;gater&quot;.<br>
<br>
To sum it up:<br>
He (Warrior) heads down to Lguk with a Cleric, Wizzy, and Shaman (will refer to this shaman as &quot;Peg&quot;), and two pick ups-another Shaman and a Monk.<br>
<br>
It gets a little rough down there, add after add.<br>
Cleric and pick up Shaman are OOM . Group asks &quot;Peg&quot;, what mana is and she says &quot;I told you 4 minutes ago I was OOM!&quot; and still continues to melee.<br>
Pick up ppl tell her to sit down and med for heals, but she still keeps poking at the frogs.<br>
Next thing I see is &quot;Loading Please Wait..&quot; on my boyfriend's monitor.<br>
Apparently everyone died except for the monk (FD) and &quot;Peg&quot; who mysteriously survived. After everyone died<br>
she told her group that the two pick up ppl were on each side of the zone training her.<br>
(I sent her a tell later asking how she survived. Apparently while the frogs were beating on her she memed gate and cast it-amazing how she survived all that..I mean when everyone died and monk FD'd the frogs would have all turned attention on her..and for her to be continously trained and still survive long enough to mem and gate at her low level-WOW! Needless to say I think she gated immediately once ppl started going down)<br>
Disgusted, the two pick ups disband.<br>
Warrior pops up along with Wizzy in FP (bindpoint) they have to run back down to Lguk to get corpses. Wizzy invis's them and Warrior grabs his corpse and drags it near the zone before he loots it. The others grab theirs, but the wizzies invis drops and within seconds she's dead. Cleric drops invis and is half dead by the time the warrior runs that way. Where is &quot;Peg&quot;? Oh..Peg was gated as soon as Wizzie bit the dust.<br>
Cleric dies. Warrior runs to zone with half health. Warrior is suppose to go and drag Cleric and Wizzies corpse to the zone. Will &quot;Peg&quot; come down and invis him so he can get the corpses? Hell no. Not wanting to wait the 2hours to regen the mass amount of hps, he zones back in with half health. He runs to the wizzies corpse and has about 8 frogs on him..he dies..again.<br>
Pops up in FP..again. Warrior sits there for about 20 minutes before &quot;Peg&quot; decides that her and the cleric can invis down there and revive everyone.<br>
 I found out that &quot;Peg&quot; does not like to invis because she does not want to take time to up her divination skills. Pity..heard from a friend she led a group into CC and refused to invis anyone on the lev down. Quite a train I heard, almost wiped out the party..<br>
This kind of idiocity drives me crazy..<br>
<br>
Course this is comming from me..a Shaman who's pet is getting beat on by Gen D'Veers in OT and making &quot;your next&quot; looks at me while I stay and make sure I reSoW my (unevil) group members so they might have a chance to make it to zone.<br>
