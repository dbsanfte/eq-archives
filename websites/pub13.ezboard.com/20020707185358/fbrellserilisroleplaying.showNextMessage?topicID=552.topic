Then I realize I must be the bad joke he repeats at deity parties.  I am sure the joke starts with “So Kosaghn was walking down the street” and ends with “So then he said “OH SH…SH…SH… CRAP!” <br>
 <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was bar night.  It’s a night we spend together when we can.  It’s hard to spend quality time with the family these days.  It’s always “well, I have to go kill this dragon”, or “You know that I have to be in Umbral in four hours: etc..<br>
  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We head into Freeport to grab a drink at the Grub and Grog tavern.  East Freeport is relatively safe.  We both have guilds there, and people don’t seem as bothered by a pair of well armed inkies walking about.  Seth has some friends that hang out there, and even though I despise them, he gets into less trouble when under adult supervision.  Grub and Grog also has some of the best steaks around, and no one seems the slightest bit bothered when you order them raw.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We hop up to the bar.  It’s a new bartender.  After a quick chat, we find that Chuppa , the regular barkeep, left to pursue a career as a Paladin’s squire.  Ah well, that’s the last we will see of him I suppose… Everyone that hangs out with Pallies tend to die a horrible screaming death.  He will be remembered as being the heaviest pourer we ever new.  Damn, you lose more good barkeeps that way…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The barkeep asks us what we want to drink, and we order up two fish wines.  The barkeep looks at us with disgust, his nose up in the air, and goes to the back of the bar to a dusty old crate.  As he opens it, dust and particles fly everywhere, causing him to sneeze and cough, much to our delight.  He pulls up a bottle, uncorks it, grabs two (I hope) clean glasses, and fills them to the top.  I love this stuff.  No one ever drinks it either, and its better and better every time we come here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I kick back with Seth, drink heavily from the glass, and savor the quiet.  We start to talk of old times, the family, Tong, and life in general.  It is a good day for sure.  Until she walks by.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Now Sturgeons are into women, call it a weakness, call it a vice, call it a one-track-mind.  It will be the death of us one day. <br>
 <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman is a barbarian.  Not my type.  Red-hair, tall, and freckled.  Sethlok’s eyes pop out of his socket.  He loves tall women.  And he has no shame or qualms about going after them whenever he sees them.  Let me tell you, there is NOTHING funnier than watching a 4’ 10” dark elf walk up to and blatantly hit on a 7+ foot woman.  Well, ok, maybe hearing him say things like “I wanna climb that mountain!” and “She may be tall, but she still goes down!”  Hehe I swear, you don’t need theatre with Seth around.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So there I am, enjoying the show while Seth fails miserably working on a woman twice his size and weight.  The wine is tasting way to good, and going down way too fast.  If I don’t watch out, there is gonna be trouble.  Which, of course, is inevitable when we do a night on the town.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So what usually comes with a 7foot tall female barbarian?  You guessed it, an 8foot tall male barbarian boyfriend.  Well we broke a record that night, cause this guy was 9foot plus.  I have NO IDEA how Seth didn’t see him.  He must have been staring at Seth the whole time, just laughing as hard as I was.  That is, until Seth put his hand on her behind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I hear a crash.  I turn over to finally notice the human ogre standing to his feet and throwing the table halfway across the room.  This guy was freaking HUGE!  I have never seen anything this big in Halas itself.   I think he was to his woman as his woman was to Seth.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ok, so this is getting serious.  I put down my glass, and start fondling my dagger.  Of course Seth’s sword was on the table next to me, not in his hands where it might be of some use right now.  The Barbarian was holding a club, with some weird runes on it.  The runes prolly said “Inkie Slayer” or something like that.  Might as well have for the look of hatred in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, the room is dead silent now.  Everyone is stepping away from the impending fight.  I know that Seth isn’t that stupid.  Only a fool would start something with a monster that big.  Especially when his sword is still lying next to me, sheathed.  I keep saying over and over in my head “apologize, step away from the girl… that’s it, apologize, say you are sorry, step away from the girl.” Why couldn’t I have a priest for a brother… jeeesh…<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Seth smiles.  He drinks down the rest of his wine, and apologizes.  “I am sorry good sir, I did not realize this delicate flower (I cough) was with you, please let me buy you a drink”.  Whew, sometimes even my brother amazes me.  Usually he would have made a challenge and gotten the crap beaten out of him, just for the sake of saving face.  Seth offers his hand in friendship, and the Barbarian takes it.<br>
<br>
And falls over, dead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp OOOOH @#%$.   OOOOH crap… He killed the big guy.  Man, they don’t make barbarians like they used too.  Wow, I wasn’t expecting that.  We might actually make it out of here alive, assuming that no one in here knows the ….<br>
<br>
“HEY!  That inkie killed Tadrok!!!! Get the bastard!!!!”  Slowly a circle of about 5 guys and one pissed of ex-girlfriend of a corpse are converging on us.  Seth Grabs his sword and takes a stance by me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uh Oh!  Why?!?!? Why must Seth kill EVERYTHING!  Why can’t he just walk away?!? Why must everything end with us getting beat on?  Why?!?!?!  Why?!?!  Why could he just but the guy a drink?!?!  Was he broke?  Is he stupid?!  Why couldn’t Mom and dad have just gotten a dog instead of breeding again?!?!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, I was gonna have to ponder this another time.  Right now, Seth and I were in a slight pickle.  My daggers out, I was backing slowly up.  Thinking hard about the best way to get out of this mess, keeping us safe, saving face, and looking like the cool Sturgeons we are…<br>
<br>
“RUUUUNNN you st..st.stupid Inkie!  RRUUUNNN!!!!!!”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, I found a way as usual.  Five seconds later you can hear us screaming like girls as we tear down the Freeport streets in fear of our lives.<br>
<br>
It’s times like these I wish Tong were still around…<br>
