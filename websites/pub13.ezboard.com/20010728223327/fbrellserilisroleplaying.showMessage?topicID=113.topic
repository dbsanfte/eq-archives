War in the Deadlands.</span><hr size=1> &quot;I'm aging, Old Bones....&quot;<br>
<br>
The Destain reclined upon a plush divan within his private chambers, the soft black leather scented with pomegranates, the bitter, pungent odour of nightshade.  He waited for Old Bones to respond.  As expected, there was no reply from the denizen of the Deadlands...he only spoke when he deemed it pertinent.  <br>
<br>
The climb up the multitude of stairs had sapped Humwawa's wan frame to the point of exertion.  His breath rattled in his chest, the sound of serpents hissing deep in the dank caverns of his lungs.  Knowing the security of his solitude, he used the secret name of the Old Bones, the dark servant sent to him so long ago by the Walker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jibantik, I am no longer resolved in my service to Our Mistress.  My flesh is no longer willing to cooperate with my will, it seems.  The tinctures of pomegranate seeds and nightshade have done nothing to ease my heart, and the one my body aches to hold has gone away....Taerma...&quot;  The Destain willed Jibantik a silent request. Silently, Old Bones prepared hot water for his nightly tea upon a flame which burned blue in the darkness.<br>
<br>
The Destain had not seen Taerma for many years.  His reckless devotion to the lush, catastrophic Black Mother had pulled them terribly apart, but perhaps it was simply a conflict of views?  A paladin cannot love a force of death, no matter the Destain's view upon the way of life and death.  Priest of Tunare, Reaper of the Children, Walker of the Violet Twilight, a thousand titles cannot give a man the strength of heart to hold a lady's love.  To Tunare's Healing Hand, his was the Red Right Hand, enervation and the ache of winter winds as they pass through an elder's skin and gnaw upon his bones.  Taerma's heart was springtime and the irresistible pull of nature, of Life and the never-ending pulse of a furiously unrelenting heartbeat.  The Destain's heart still burned, aye - but cold corpsefire, funereal pyres never warm the the living.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord.  Your tincture.&quot;  Jibantik's voice was the sound of fault lines moving underground, shifting bones and loam across hard granite moving through Humwawa's mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thankee sai.&quot;  The Destain tapped his throat with his index and middle finger three times in thanks.  He rose up to take the glass.<br>
<br>
The tincture was sweet and sour, hot and cold, cloying and thin - a contradiction in a glass. He sipped it lightly due to it's near-boiling heat.  Lost in thought, he finished the small glass and motioned for Jibantik to take it away.<br>
<br>
Old Bones slid slowly along the stone floor, scarabs scuttling on jagged rock.  He rose up before his master, and his fleshless left hand lightly plucked the cup out of the Destain's hand.  Yet the servant did not leave.<br>
<br>
A small smile, a raised eyebrow caught the Destain's impassable features.  &quot;Yes, Jibantik?&quot;<br>
<br>
The right, and equally fleshless hand raised slowly from the servant's side and lightly passed over the Destain's face.  Humwawa's mind choked upon a sudden fog.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sleep, master.  Sleep and dream of greater days, when your Red Hand blazed with conviction.  When no man or god could hide their souls from you...sleep now, my master&quot;.<br>
<br>
Humwawa slumped upon the divan.  And he had a dream.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The desert of Ro teemed with hidden beings at night.  Out from secret dens the jackals rose from their daysleeping and ran out to follow the shamblings of horrors which had died from heat and thirst but would not pass through the Veil.  They hoped to capture a few scraps from the monstrosities' decaying bodies, and perhaps even a morsel from a foolish traveller who passed their path.<br>
<br>
However, this night was different.  The desert clutched itself in pain under the bleached bone-light of a frenzied moon and her rabid stars. It was a night of power or rather, of Necropotence.  The Veil was very thin that night, and the Destain knew it. He had been summoned here by his goddess, but there were many others coming, heeding the summons of other higher powers.<br>
<br>
Humwawa stood quietly upon a half-buried stone monolith, Old Bones nearby in the shadows of a crevice in the old stonework.  He could feel the waves of strength crushing against him, and yet his head never bowed.  In a secret fold of his black robes six black stones raged desperately to be released from his hold, insisting that the action he would soon follow would alienate him from his homeland forever.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am in exile of my own will, servants of the Father. This will change nothing.&quot;  The Destain's crimson eyes were filled with light, a fierce fire which matched his flushed right hand.  He was very strong this night.<br>
<br>
He felt the others coming.  He felt some of them flowing over the sands along the winds like fate for a doomed man.  He felt the holy knights draw their blessed weapons and cut down the walking dead which assaulted them upon the sands, heard the silent whispers the priests uttered to drive away demons.  He felt the minstrels singing the world through their lips, their feet moving in a blur no living being could see as they raced across the sand.  And he felt another, darker force - one even greater than he, but bound by the will of the Dark Prince.  Humwawa knew her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mizraene, you've brought pride upon the Father's name...&quot; he whispered to the winds, &quot;and you do him greater honour by not sparing Him your hatred.&quot;<br>
<br>
They gathered upon the monolith one by one, until a great mass of all the world's mighty had congregated there.  The unrestrained force which gathered in the night wind and under the savage moon buckled in the intoxication of their power.  The Destain saw Mizraene, now garbed in the robes of the Arch Lich, smile crookedly upon him.  He bowed from his waist slightly, tapped his throat in greeting. She turned away.  Humwawa drew the stones from the folds of his robe and handed them each to the six sorcerers who had agreed to the ceremony.<br>
<br>
They held hands there, a circle of sages and paladins, woodsmen and myrmidons, all enraptured in a single song which was led by bards and mystics with a full voice.  The skies twisted hungrily to escape their foundations, the pillars of the earth creaked and groaned like splintering boards in an ancient building.  The stars realigned themselves to form abominations which spat blasphemies down upon them in rage.  How dare mortals challenge the ways of Nature, they cried. Still they sang.  And the stones screamed.<br>
<br>
The Sky fell.  The earth hissed a death-rattle and dropped away from their feet.  They fell slowly down amidst starstuff and shattered earth.  Reality had been broken.  One by one, they died.<br>
<br>
They awoke upon the Deadlands. Humwawa was the first to raise himself from the ephemeral, glowing gemstudded rock which had been cut from the ether by the hand of Innoruuk himself to construct the City of the Dead.  The rest rose shortly after, priests and shamans calling upon the heavens for protection from the clinging dark which flowed through the City, knights kneeling upon the sacriligious stones and calling desperately for strength.  The Destain stood quietly.  For the first time he met his servant in his true form.  From the darkness a shadow rose, filled with mouths one could not see but only hear, eyes hooded in a shroud of bleak blackness but still felt boring through flesh hungrily for a chance to glimpse a living soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jibantik..come to me,&quot; he whispered.  He cast shattered bones upon the ground.  The rock cracked beneath them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, master.  I hear ye.  I obey.&quot;  The shadow took a skeletal form to simulate the corporeal body he inhabited upon the waking world as if he might ease his master with a facsimile.  &quot;And I warn ye...the Father's armies come&quot;.<br>
<br>
The scouts screamed a warning, but did not stop their howlings as beings no living man had ever seen before seeped into their eyes, their ears and forced their bodies to scream until their lungs collapsed.  The priests gestured holy signs of warding in horror.  Warrior men and women ceased to sharpen their blades and grimly rose them against the rising dark of Innoruuk.  Humwawa's lips tightened, and he silently prayed to the Walker for strength, and the flesh slid from his bones.  He calmly noticed that the ground was not slick with blood - the ground opened its mouth hungrily to recieve it.  Only Mizraene, Misery, smiled savagely as her hands wove poison through the air, a garment which comforts and warms nothing.  The Deadlands were filled with screaming.  The fallen were dragged back to the holy men who attempted to raise them with divine intervention.  At worst the fallen were unceremoniously thrown upon the slithering back of an abomination and hauled down to the darkness of the Deadlands, where corpses' voices were once again wracked with moaning even after being stilled with death.  And all the while the scorn banshees wailed.<br>
<br>
A Koada'Dal priest of Tunare gritted his teeth and shimmered with a light so devastatingly beautiful Humwawa's spirit struck a beat once, then stilled once more.  They were winning.  Between the waves of assault the mortal army checked the bodies of the fallen horrors for pieces of divine armour which Innoruuk had stolen from the heavens in jealousy.  Stoically they strapped gleaming breastplates upon their chests, cast down their inferior blades and drew from dead, festering hands maces which blasted holy light from them with a furnace's heat.  It was during this break from battle that the skies bled fire, the darkness wrapped itself heavily around their hearts, despair bloomed its nefarious flower over them.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's coming..,&quot; Mizraene whispered giddily.  The high elven priest blanched noticeably, but set his jaw and mouthed voicelessly the name of Tunare.  Humwawa felt his will rock under the divine wrath of the god who made him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare, under this hate no living thing may grow to maturity...I need you - I am dying.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the Walker stepped through the Veil and entered him, lush and flushed with the nectar of immortality, Humwawa saw God.  Rearing above him like a monstrous thunderhead, malevolent with the roar of thunder and the night-terror of children, throbbing in His palpable Rage, the Prince of Hate towered above those heroic men and women.  They writhed under the holocaustic might which girded his waist, the furious anger which had torn angels from the skies with claws of divine, iron will.  His eyes flaring bloody and insane many wheels above them blasted through them.  In an anguished shriek a lady woodsman convulsed and fell twisted to the ground, her life disrupted by the full force of his unfathomable fury.  The silence was broken as the scorn banshees opened their throats with their bloody claws so the howling praises they sing might bleed more strongly from their lungs.  The rapidly decreasing mortal legion rose their blades, their desperate cries to deities who where infinitely distant from this rotting hell answered faintly.  Words of power scorched the ground, starfire blazed down from the heavens.  The Father brought down his will upon Mizraene, and as her eyes went dim her smile widened with madness. &quot;I've come home,&quot; she sighed.<br>
<br>
The blackness surrounding the Father grew fainter, less palpable.  The Destain cried out the words of necromancy with a voice finely crafted, a clear instrument projecting in words the substance of life and death.  The Walker guided every stroke; he grew drunk with the soul of a god surging fatally through his veins as he siphoned the spirit of Innoruuk.  The armies of Innoruuk rushed forward to defend their dying lord, and scores of men and women fell under cruel blades and feral claws.<br>
<br>
The Father turned his will upon the Destain.  He could feel the crushing presence of his Maker draw upon the fabric of reality for strength...he felt force shock him blind.  He regained sight.  Old Bones, Jibantik, stood between them, his hands burst into crimson flame as he drove them into godflesh, a starved man gorged upon a sacred feast.  Innoruuk raised his right hand, brought it down to strike Humwawa.  A skeletal hand rose up to catch it upon its palm.  Jibantik shattered into dust.<br>
<br>
Weak and dying, the Destain called out a last word of death down upon the Dark Prince.  The air shook with the word no mortal understood yet could feel leaden and squirming in their chest.  Silence rang through the Deadlands.  Throughout the entire world, the walking dead crumbled into grotesque husks, their essence drained from them.  The curtain in the deepest sanctuary of the Temple of Innoruuk in Neriak was torn asunder before it lit suddenly in a pure flame which consumed it utterly.  The High Priestess' eyes were struck sightless upon looking on it.  The scorn banshees' voices were torn from their throats as the Prince of Hate's last remaining portion of divinity was wrested from him, drawn into the mortal body of a necromancer - a priest of Tunare.<br>
<br>
Humwawa's eyes rolled back into their sockets.  His flesh returned to him.  Muscles spasmed in his chest and legs, his heart was taut with hot blood.  He felt his body rupturing with the stolen might of a god.  Unable to control the stuff of gods, his mouth opened and let loose a wail which shattered turrets in Innoruuk's empty palace, scattered hosts of demons like dust.  The Destain wept, and collapsed.<br>
<br>
He awoke to find himself alone in the Deadlands.  The mortal army was annihilated by the denizens who savagely wreaked their retribution upon them, assuaging their failing Innoruuk with hate and living flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I am not alone here...&quot;  he whispered weakly.  The high elven cleric of Tunare sat huddled amoungst the bodies, shivering and weak yet surrounded by a sense of quiet justice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Talos......we won,&quot; the Destain gasped hoarsely with a voice which was the rumbling of a thousand sepulchres opening, &quot;and I do not think my voice will ever be the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The Destain stirred from his induced slumber.  His eyes opened slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jibantik?&quot; he spoke questioningly.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, master: close your eyes.  It is time for you to dream and leave this world for a time.  I shall guard ye until you waken, Destain.  But now I order ye: Go to thy Mother's arms and allow her to hold ye close - She has been waiting for ye, my lord.&quot;  Jibantik's right hand gently closed his eyes.  He doused the torches.<br>
<br>
Old Bones turned around slowly to face a dark pool of shadow which clung to a corner of the private chambers quite unnaturally.  He knelt down humbly, touching his fleshless forehead to the floor even as his eyes cast vermillion light throughout the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Lady Tunare...he might yet reach the enlightenment you bring.  He is worthy of Demilich - I know it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shadows quivered slightly and, if shadows could, it would have smiled gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall see to it.  Fear not, great one.&quot;  The Walker of the Violet Twilight's voice rang like a bell, and echoed softly as it faded away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
