<br>
So it's ok for the Israeli's to kill 1 terrorist plus X innocents, but it's wrong for Terrorists to kill 1 soldier plus X innocents?<br>
<br>
An argument can be made that Terrorists don't give a rats arse about what they target. Hmm, i wonder if some civilian deaths on the Israeli side where off duty soldiers...<br>
<br>
Any way, we keep calling them Terrorists, cept in their culture they're called freedom fighters. They're there to punish the Israeli's for their crimes against humanity and free the people from poverty caused by the Israeli's.<br>
<br>
It's a daring statement, but think about it. Each side gets information about the situation, it's called propaganda. You might be entirely convinced about what you believe, well so are they.<br>
<br>
To be truely objective, you just have to look at who are targeting civilians, which in this case is both sides. Also look at who suffer the most, which is in this case the Palestinian people. really, take a step back from all the prejudice and newsreporters opinions, look at the big picture here. Set aside cultural differences, throw away religion. View the firepower and wealth on each side. Look at housing and who lose their homes. Don't only look at the deathrate, also look at the victimrate. Think carefully what your definition of victim is.<br>
<br>
Step back and look.<br>
<br>
Get it? Can you finally see?<br>
<br>
If you don't see it, your influenced by propaganda and can't possibly claim to have an objective view. <p>

<br>
If there were say a large concentration of terrorists in by your example Canada. And the majority of local populace seemed to be sympathizers with regards to the terrorists. And the government of Canada didn't seem to be making an earnest effort to stamp out the terrorists, but instead had strong ties linking it to the terrorists.<br>
<br>
Then I would support military action to remove the threat posed by our neighbors. That might include targets of opportunity in cities. Such as the residences of key opposing military leaders.

I'm curious about something though. You keep attacking America and Americans in your posts and I have yet to make one derrogtory comment about your own nationality. I don't even know your nationality and don't care because it's not germane to the discuission. I am treating you as an individual and addressing you as such. Why do you feel the need to attack my nationality? Do you think it lends weight to your argument? If you hate Americans that's fine with me and nothing new. I would ask that you please keep your hatred out of this discussion and stick to the topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umozmonar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mozmonar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Mighty Jackalope</span><br>  Posts: 665<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/02 8:32:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bullseyedesigns.com/sideshow/people/limbless/jeck.gif width=80 height=72></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Or because</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> sooo......if it turns out a dangerous terrorist lives in your home town, it would be ok to bomb the house he lives in, even though there was a high risk of hitting your house, killing you and your family?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I said it was probably a bad call. In otherwords a call I wouldn't make. But my opinion of the situation as an outside, uninformed bystander isn't important. Let's look at other possible scenarios for the apprehension/elimination of this target. They could have sent in a commando raid like the ones in Mogadishu, Somalia. That could have resulted in a much higher casualty rate on both sides. They could have rolled tanks in to the neighborhood to try to box the guy in. Still could have resulted in a high casualty rate on the Palestinian side and might have allowed the target to escape. Or they could have ignored the intelligence and let the target go. Which would have resulted in a higher casualty rate on the Israeli side since he would still be orchesrtating terrorist attacks.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I am not jumping to conclusion either, it is just what I see and hear on the news.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I see so the Israelis are guilty until proven innocent because of the media.

<br>
Both Terrorist and Israeli attacks can be called retaliations. It's part of the vicious cylce they're in.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Moz, read the below lines carefully:<br>
<br>
- I'm Anti-everything that causes harm to innocent civilians, be it Terrorist retaliation/attacks, Israeli retaliations/attacks, biased media reports, and so on.<br>
<br>
- I also condemn every country's GOVERMENT which supports War Crimes, protects or claim to protect with any means necessary criminals of war, or any criminal in any case. Which includes the American goverment. Or don't you know what i am talking about?<br>
<br>
- I support everyone who needs it. The Israeli AND Palestinian goverments don't need my support. The civilians in both nations do.<br>
<br>
I thought i was clear on what i was talking about and stated it several times. The Israeli people are NOT the Israeli Goverment. The Palestinian people are NOT the Palestinian goverment. On every line you quoted me on Mozmonar, you fail to include these statements in your quotes. It's called selective judgement. <p>

Please seperate Israeli people and Palestinian people from their goverments/army and terrorists.<br>
<br>
We're condemning the same actions, but on both sides.<br>
<br>
It's not a Black and White world mate.<br>
Else humans woulnd't exist after the Nukes dropped.<br>
<br>
In any conflict (You might have learned this at preschool) there are 2 guilty parties.<br>
<br>
What you are trying to do Mosmonar, is to single out a victim, both parties are victims just as both parties are guilty.<br>
<br>
We just have to help the people caught in the conflict. ON BOTH SIDES, not just the Israeli's. Condemn any action from BOTH sides.<br>
<br>
You yourself said that there is no excuse for acts of violence. retaliating with force is also violence. Or are you saying the Israeli's are justified in their actions? And if so, why?<br>
<br>
Also, are you only looking for information on israeli casualties? if so, look on the other side as well... You can't understand if you objectively viewed all information. Watching CNN and reading jewish documents only give you one side of the story which is the anti-Palestinian side. <p>

I don't personally agree with this decision but there is nothing substantial I can do about it until the election time. <br>
<br>
We both know that's not specifically what you are referring to when you keep making attacks in these posts. Let's look at them...<br>
<br>
In one of your little tantrums you wrote:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> - God bless the KKK<br>

<br>
I still have family in the US, and i like the US on many point except on it's political views. The world community has been working hard to establish an international court for war crimes. America reacted with a new law, where if any american citizans/civilians where to put to justice for war crimes, America can and will do anything using any means to prevent it. In other words Americans are only subject to American law and can do bloody well anything outside the US.<br>
<br>
I believe both Bush and Gore are nitwits, cept Gore has more intelligence. U peeps shoulda voted for him!<br>
<br>
Again i have nothing against the US, except on their double standards, arrogance and hypocritisism on a political level. Thanks to Bush, the PR of the US in other countries is dwindling fast! Lord i miss Clinton, that sexually frustrated hippy, lol, at least he had the right ideas on a political level.<br>
<br>
No bashing on America, but on several peeps who are running it. I can bash on my own country's goverment on the same subjects, which we do and are allowed because of Democracy and freedom of speech<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->back to taking pot shots now...<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wonder why people hate America?

<br>
Innocent till the Media claims guilty, fuk what the judge says.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Sure a few times there you mentioned your displeasure with the stance the Bush administration has taken with regards to the War Crimes issue. Many Americans take issue with that stance as well. You aren't going to try to say that every shot you took there was regarding that. That's a fairly recent issue and hatred towards the US is long standing. That's the just the latest and greatest reason to hate us. And it still has nothing to do with the Palestinian/Israeli issue so I fail to see the relevance in bringing it up. And in many of those cases you are making your attacks in response to something I said as if I and by extension all Americans support the KKK and War Criminals and that we are all duped because we watch the news reports and that you aren't duped because you watch the news reports (I recall you or greebo suggesting that we watch al Jazeira rather than CNN as if that isn't a biased news source).<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> F16 Bomber, which means a F16 jet carry-ing bombs...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->An F-16 I believe is considered a multirole fighter which means it can carry bombs. It didn't bomb the house Shehade was in. It fired a single missile. This is according to Palestinian witnesses.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You yourself said that there is no excuse for acts of violence. retaliating with force is also violence. Or are you saying the Israeli's are justified in their actions? And if so, why?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I said there is no excuse for murder. Violence does not equal murder. Sometimes violence must be answered with violence. And this will make the third time I have said I probably would have chosen a different course of action regarding the Shehade attack. But I can understand the reasoning behind it and I don't totally disagree with it.<br>
<br>
I am curious though what your solution would bring about. Let's say the Israeli's stopped responding to Terrorist attacks. Everytime a terrorist went into a night club and detonated. They did nothing. Everytime one opened fire on a crowd they did nothing. Everytime crowds started getting agitated and attacking soldiers they did nothing. Do you think that would make the terrorists stop or do you think it would embolden them? Arafat and his police have no interest in stopping the terrorists and they aren't in any tangible way seeking to arrest them. So now he crowd that was being loud and throwing rocks knows that the soldiers will do nothing. So they can escalate their violence without fear of reprisal. Maybe when they feel bold enough they overrun the soldier's position and beat them to death. Drag their bodies through the streets. These kinds of things happen when you demonstrate through word and action that you are not willing to fight back.<br>
<br>
I won't convice you of any of this. The Palestinians civilian and terrorist alike as well as the surrounding Arab nations want the Israelis driven into the sea. Until that thinking changes there is going to be constant tension and violence. In the mean time the Israelis need to defend their &quot;right to exist&quot; by policy and by force. No one else is going to do it for them.<br>
<br>
I'm finished with this discussion. You have read my views and I have read yours. Further debate is a continued exercise in futility on both parts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvaal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaal</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/23/02 2:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=127>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Or because</span><hr size=1> Greyborne said<br>

<br>
That is incorrect, if I am walking home after work and some guy jumps me with a knife, there is only one guilty party, the aggressor.<br>
<br>
Applying it to this situation, the Israelis were given land controlled by Britain after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire under the Balfour Mandate of 1917, which clearly states that they are going to create the state of Palestine for the Jews. So the Jews started to move into the area that was set up for them beginning in 1917, the Israelis were attacked when their state was formed by the Arabs and in the successive wars they (the Israelis) expanded what was now the independent state of Israel into what was supposed to be the Arab state of Palestine. <br>
<br>
In 2000, the Israelis (under Barak) offered 95% of the West Bank, full control of the Gaza Strip, with a land link between the 2. In exchange for the 5%, the Gaza Strip would be enlarged by a third. Arafat rejected these because “For him to end the conflict is to end himself,” said Ambassador Dennis Ross, the chief negotiator for the U.S.<br>

Innocent people are dying, you can hide behind technical details about whether an F16 was used to drop a bomb or whatever. Sure I read where you said it was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> probably</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a bad call, what I think is that it IS a bad call no matter what. I have a feeling we will never agree on this.<br>
To get back to the original question (again): <br>
Mozmonar, I assume you are an American (don't want to make the same mistake twice eh Vaal?). How do you feel about the fact that in a certain way you have paid for those 12 people to die? You say it was probably a bad call. Can I conclude that you feel sorry about the innocent people who have died? (I certainly hope so) My question to you is: do you think the American government should do something to prevent them from making any more mistakes like that? (like not giving them anymore money, or stepping in) Or do you think it is best to give them the money they need to buy more weapons (to possibly make more mistakes like this)?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxargan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xargan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 1:45:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=129>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Or because</span><hr size=1> Israel has our only good spies in the area ;p<br>

I admit, the discussion is gettin heated at certain times. But we're getting there ;-) What i see is, we largely agree on the same subjects. Only we neglect the rest and other possibilities.<br>
<br>
Picture this. Israel retaliates on a terrorist attack, they send missiles into a residential area. They kill a mastermind terrorist and his neighbours. A palestinian man comes home and finds his home destroyed, his wife and children dead, killed by Israeli's. What do you think he's gonna do?<br>
<br>
Right, he goin after the people who are murdering his people. See a resemblance here?<br>
<br>
Israel is feuling the Terrorists with new recruits.<br>
<br>
America almost annihilated Al Qaida and their supporters, quick, short and brief. Afghanistan was free. @#%$ still happens there, but no more dictatorship of religious muslim extremeists. Is America save now?<br>
<br>
What needs to be done is to stop feuling terrorists, any retaliation which harms civilian targets is fuel. Now, why are the Palestinians so angry on the Israeli's and America? Awnser: Where are the riches and who are telling them what to do.<br>
<br>
There are other ways than fighting terrorism with violence, more efficient ways. And no, not protest with words or crappy hippy sjit. Make them dependant on something, give them something to lose. They'll be more carefull, right now, they have nothing to lose. And the Israeli's are keeping things that way, America is supporting it as well.<br>
<br>
Now.. Europe aint doin diddly, they are just watching and commenting. This i hate as well, i hate to be part of a hypocrit nation. <p>

<br>
So, Arafat is also in charge of the Israeli army as well as Muslim extremist groups? And the true leader of Al Qaida? And the occasional deluded person who has nothing left thanks to the Israeli's and blows up a bar?<br>
<br>
I find the notion that terrorists don't have a motive rather ignorant. Why are there so many terrorist active in Palestina? Because they lost something dear to them to the isreali's, be it family, shelter, jobs, whatever, and have nothing left to live for. Did Arafat cause all this?<br>
<br>
Arafat is no sweet guy, i'm sure of that, but he's trying with the means at hand to solve this peacefully. These means include having contacts with terrorists. So Arafat has ties with terrorists...<br>
<br>
Do people really think that if Arafat told the terrorists to stop, they'd listen to him? Do you think the terrorist need an order from Arafat to blow stuff up? Now there is a conspiracy theory if i ever heard one.<br>

<br>
So, greyborne, if Arafat is so committed to peace, why did he turn down the treaty offered to him by Barak and Clinton in 2000? You know, the one that would have given him the arab state of palestine. If there had been a peace treaty there would be no more violence, correct? So if Arafat turned down a peace treaty which gave him what he wanted, he obviously has no desire for peace.<br>
<br>
Which leads me back to the original statement, every death since 2000 can be laid at Arafat's door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugreebo25.showPublicProfile?language=EN>greebo25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 12:37:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   we're on a road to nowhere</span><hr size=1> Xargan said:<br>

I am sorry but over here people are not able to do such a thing, however, since I happen to be a biologist I see an oppurtunity here to study the evolution of vocal chords in that region. <br>
<br>
Seriously, to comment on what you probably mean by this: <br>
Of course the foundation of many European countries is Christianity, but when it comes to passing laws and stuff like that the church is not actively involved. I have tried to find the post where I said something about this but I can't find it anymore!! (or maybe I just thought it after reading someone else's post?) <br>
<br>
Anyway, I think we aren't getting anywhere here. We are never going to agree on who is right and who is wrong. I agree (beforehand) that the whole idea of a forum is to discuss something, and not to get other people to totally agree with what you think. But this has turned into some sort of contest. To sum things up:<br>
People are dying over there. We can go on and on about who is to blame the most, but that will not make any difference. As long as both sides are sufficiently armed it will go on. Since you can make a weapon out of practically anything, it doesn't seem it will ever end, unless one side is wiped out. That side will probably be the Palestinians, since the Israeli's have the US on their side. I don't think that's fair, and whatever you say isn't going to change that. So you can save yourself the effort of trying to convince me of that what the Israeli's are doing is justified. I will save myself the effort of telling you that I don't think the Palestinians are justified to kill Israeli's, however, I do feel they have a right to be there and to be treated like human beings. From what I've seen on tv and from what I've heard from people who have lived there, that's not the case. <br>
In conclusion: I'm not gonna discuss this issue anymore, however, I'm still very interested in your answer to the original question, taking into consideration about what I said about US taxmoney being spent on weapons such as the F16 that was used two days ago.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxargan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xargan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 7:33:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=137>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: we're on a road to nowhere</span><hr size=1> btw, the US has given over 5 billion dollars to Palastine over the last few years....wonder why they have no weapons, much less a McDonalds?

All politcians, regardless of nationality, race or religion are criminals. Be it european, american or swaziland. They all have a certain corruptness you need to be a politician in this day and age, and it would be naive to say it's not.<br>
<br>
Nah Xargan, what i see is that you don't set a difference between Palestinian people and Terrorists, in your example:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

This is not putting things in perspective, this is generalising all Canadians to be Terrorists. If the goverment was supporting this and/or joining in this, then it wouldn't be a terrorist act, but a war, since Canada has an army.<br>
<br>
The way i see it, Arafat was Israel's last chance to solve this peacefully. For those who think Arafat is in charge, let me say this. If Arafat does something the Muslim extremeists (aka Terrorists) didn't like, he'd be killed by his own people. If Arafat does something the Israeli's didn't like, missiles get shot at his house.<br>
<br>
Hmm, and still he's trying to talk to both parties involved and trying to make something out of it.<br>
<br>
Israel is claiming that Arafat is the source of all terrorist action based on the fact he's talking with terrorists. I have yet to see proof for this. You need to talk to terrorist to negotiate don't you? And negotiating is easier if they where friends, isn't it? It's not like Israel or America is succesfull in fighting terrorism, so you might as well try to talk to them and pacify them. <p>
