First of all you dumbass, I am an American and damn proud of it.  Yes I have Korean blood running through me.  What I was saying about &quot;getting out of our country&quot; is @#%$ I hear sometimes from ignorant @#%$ people that live in the US.  /point Bashere.<br>

Like its their country, give me a @#%$ break.  News flash, if anything the Europeans &quot;stole&quot; the country from the native americans, who btw most scientist believe came from Asia during the Ice Age.  It just amuses me that some people think that they somehow own this country or some @#%$.  Its about dumb as saying, quit playing &quot;our&quot; game.  If you haven't notice yet, probably not since your intelligence is probably less than 50, EQ is a global game.  Not just for &quot;us&quot;(americans).  Get a check on reality, idiot.<br>
<br>
BTW, Hey why don't you do all of us a favor and pack up your @#%$ and go back to &quot;your own&quot; country.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

BTW, the reaction I have to a Korean player who logs on is, &quot;wow that's impressive for someone to learn another language enough, learn about the game, find it, get the connections, and figure out all the cultural stuff well enough to play&quot;. I think it's neat to have them, as long as they are nice too - allowing for some misunderstandings etc. And my experiences with the folks in the guild that was Paths of Trust was very nice, they were friendly and fun. If they acted like jerks regularly, I'd feel differently; they don't. <p>Level 59 Conjurer, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

It kind of made you think a little bit more about the person behind the game, not just what "kind" of person you're dealing with because, well, you don't know.  It could be a 60 year old man who was a vietnam veteran and owns his own private business now, or a 12 year old kid having a hard time in jr. high math.<br>
<br>
While people from a different country do have different cultural beliefs than Americans, I've gotten along just fine with many of them.  There are jerks overseas and there are quite frankly many more jerks over here who play the game because the majority of players are American.  Reguardless of that fact though, nationallity really should have absolutely nothing to do with one players, or even an entire guilds mistakes and shortcomings in their dealings with other players.  When they enter the game they abide by the same rules we do, have the same options we do, do the same things we do, reguardless of their nationallity.  That's one of those things that should never have been brought up in that topic, because it was completely irrelevant. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utheskyfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Skyfyre</A> at: 5/22/01 3:56:12 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uerylflynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eryl Flynn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.bloodcircle.com/images/bcicon.jpg height=22 width=22 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/22/01 7:58:13 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.bloodcircle.com/images/bcicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmm.</span><hr size=1> Along the lines of what Andervin said, I strongly believe that when you visit some place or move there you should spwak the native language.  This reason is why I likely will never travel much, I would feel like a rude prick to expect every one in a country I visit to speak my native language for me.<br>
<br>
I also believe you should be able to converse enough to interact with anyone you plan on interacting with in EQ meaning, speak english, the game is designed for english speaking people primarily.  This does not mean you need to speak english, but don't expect to group or buy/sell from anyone that is not of your native group.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I have many friends from other nations, and occasionally we have some trouble communicating.  Knowing where they are from I am never afraid to say hold on, I have no clue what you said and point out what threw me.  It can take work for both parties, but you still need to understand the language. <p><br>

<br>
Sure Verant's staff is culturaly diverse, find me a company in the US that isn't, duh.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't play an american game, hell I'm all for it, more the merrier.  What I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> am</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> saying is that they shouldn't be surprised or indignatious when the language barrier causes problems for them.  <br>

It's an american game and english is the predominate language, if they can't speak it, tough, I'm not shedding any tears over here.

As for your comments about being only hosted in America(San Diego really).  They do this out of pure business reasons, not cause they want everyone to know its an American game.  Get a grip fool.  They want the servers near them, if they were located in Norway, you think they would have servers in the US, LOL.  Anyways, you don't see Verant saying you shouldn't play this game if don't have a rudimentary grasp of the language.  LOL, I hope you don't ever run your own business.  Andervin tells customer_01, oh you don't speak english too well, I can't sell you nothing, sorry.  Andervin's company_00 files for bankruptcy.  haha<br>
<br>
&quot;American programmers&quot;- you admitted they are culturally diverse.  I even bet that not all the programmers are not &quot;americans&quot;.  I bet some are mexicans, russian, chinese, japanese, korean, indian etc... with a work Visa! <br>
<br>
Also, you even admitted it.  It's OWNED by Sony.  Well @#%$, if they own it, its Sony's game right?  Sony is a Japanese company, hence its a Japanese game!  This is using your dumbass logic btw.  Why does it matter that Sony didn't own it in the beginning? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

BTW, I just turned on the bozo bit for you!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    (Andervin is probably too stupid to know the reference to the bozo bit but I bet the culturally diverse programmers at Verant know what I'm talking about!).<br>
<br>
On a final note, Andervin if you got a problem, start your own damn Rant!  This is my rant, a Korean American rant!  If you are not a Korean American, stay out of our rant space!<br>
<br>
Thanks, but I'm done arguing with Andervin.  People with small minds just ruin it for me.  Ever try arguing with a 5 year old?  You will never win!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><B>Arip MourneBlade</B>

<br>
Ring der Ehre is a German-speaking guild and represents the finest ideals of the game, in my opinion.  Granted, the Ring members I've played with are quite fluent in English, but there is no reason that players who aren't fluent can't excel at the game.  I've noticed a number of other national guilds that I'm less familiar with, but have had no problems in working with Japanese, Spanish and French players.  Of course, it does help when proper English is used instead of d00dspeak... <p><i>The trick is to die but rarely.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uandervinscorpse06.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andervins corpse06</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/23/01 11:02:52 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/dragica8/logos/skelgivingbird.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Graagh-Bashere </span><hr size=1> Awww, you're done arguing with me?  boo hoo, I so enjoy argue with self indulgent adolescents with a superiority complex.

Hmm, I would hazard a guess (I'm playing petoffen here as amatuer psychiatrist) that someone was teased a lot in school for their nationality.  Get a grip dude, people hate you because you're an azzhole, not becuase you're Korean.<br>

As for commenting on my mom, this shows the level or your maturity.  Calling me a self indulgent adolescents, HA!, look in the mirror if you wanna see one.
