What do you think?</span><hr size=1> I have a quick question for you all seeing as how most who post here are loyally guilded.<br>
<br>
Is it right (At anytime.) for a needed group member to just up and disband from the group he/she is presently in to go and assist their guild?<br>
<br>
I have had this happen MANY times in the past to all of my characters though it never really bothered me till last night.<br>
<br>
While in an OT ledge group last night, Adiera and my Bard Meloden had this happen to our group at least four times!  It wasn't really too hard on us as we were able to fill the ranks again soon after each departure.  But the principle of the thing is simply; is it right?<br>
<br>
My opinion is no.  If your going to take the time of a group of people to get into their group you should stick with it till a pre-arranged bail time or an RL emergency.  (If neither of those two then maybe at least stick with it till a replacement can be found).  Honestly IMHO I am thinking that this excuse is getting a bit overused of late.  Then again another phenomenon I have been experiencing ALOT lately is the UberTwinks who come into the group with stories of their high end alternates/mains.  Though this in itself has never been any kind of hassle, these ARE the ones most likely to log out of the group to log into their main to assist their guild.<br>
<br>
Anyways was just wondering what you all thought about this type of occurance.<br>

I mean, do it nicely of course, but that's what pick-up groups are.... pick-up.<br>
<br>
Pickup the slack with new members once someone has to leave.<br>
<br>
That group will probably be together in its entirety once... ever.<br>
<br>
Your guild will be together more times than you can count... my guild will always be more important than anything I am personally doing in a group, and I personally think that is how it should be.<br>

What do you think?</span><hr size=1> Honestly, I think the &quot;my guild needs me&quot; excuse is exploited just to bail on a group, because no one questions it, and it allows you to just go on your merry way without the group doing a /w all bailout_guy a few minutes later and seeing that you didn't really have to leave for your dentist's appointment or because your kid set the neighborhood on fire.  It's a cop-out excuse that everyone uses at some time or another... sometimes just to get out of a lame group.<br>
<br>
Then again, there are certain to be many times when &quot;my guild needs me&quot; IS a valid excuse, and I personally feel that guild &gt; group... after all you have a lasting loyalty and relationship to your guild, whereas there is no such bond with a pickup group, especially in a place like OT where replacements are a dime a dozen.  Being the only porter in a HS group, saying &quot;my guild needs me&quot; and either stranding the group or forcing them to abort is BS.  But sometimes, some people are key role players for a guild... maybe it's the only guild porter, and he's needed to get everyone in place for a guild raid, or a cleric has to go rez her guild's failed attempt at some dungeon, or a warrior who's needed as MA for some guild event.  How do you suggest they explain that they can't abandon a piddling XP group in OT to join his guildmates when they NEED that person? <p><CENTER>Feydakin Rainsong<BR>

I rarely ditch a group unless I have to but I recall a situation not long ago when a group of Guildies got wasted but the AOF in Cazic Thule.  I had to ditch my group to go pull corpses, and I didn't feel the least bit sorry for it. <p>________________________<BR>

As was mentioned earlier, it is a pick-up group. It's like playing hoops, it's a pick-up game, if someone has to go you find someone else to take up their spot. Your guild will always be there for you, as I will be there for mine when needed. I stay in the group until the last moment possible or until a replacement arrives though to be courteous and give them a chance to find someone to replace myself.<br>
<br>
Personally, I do not believe guild > group is being used to get out of groups, last time I saw that kosher stuff was about level 20 or less even. I have a bond to my guild and a sense of loyalty to them, whether they helped me or not in the past, I bare the name proud and stand up for my guildmates and gladly assist them when I can.<br>

Yeah people LFG in Dreads are slim at 3-4am EST, but at give us a little leeway.  Wait until your porter gets to the spot where you're getting picked up or whatever.  <br>
If things are going to go bad, or a raid is starting, tell your group as soon as you know so they can start finding replacements.  <br>
<br>
Your guild is your family though, they're the people who are always in the nice green text every single time you log in.

That happened to me only in Overthere the other day.  Had a Gnome Cleric or DE don't recall.  Either way they were able to do braids.  Well someone had looted 3 braids to their(the cleric) One.  So he made a comment and the Bard that had looted the 3 said I asked if anyone else wanted and heard nothing.  Well the Cleric got pissed and after I pull a couple of blues he disbands and send a tell saying he hoped I die since I was group leader and let Bard do that.  Only thing was their conversation was going on while I was out pullin... <p>________________________<BR>

Usually I have more than enough warning that I can start looking for a replacement an hour before I have to be wherever it is.<br>
<br>
Usually, though, I ask if they really need me.  If it's an epic mob and they have a couple of 57+ chanters already, well, I would be awfully redundant because my buffs suck compared to theirs =)<br>
<br>
If it's a pickup group with a guildmate in it and I get an invite, I will probably disband as well, but definitely not until finding a replacement.<br>

<br>
For example, I get asked by friends to help them out with epic fights in CoM or the Hole. Usually they ask me in advance. I show up to help them and because they asked me, I figure I'm very much needed and wanted there so short of a downright emergency, no one is going to pry me from that obligation.<br>
<br>
Then there's the question of proximity. If I'm in a Hole group, it's a real hassle to just leave, so again, the Guild needs would have to weigh in against that situation. Usually when one person has to go, y'all have to go, unless you can get someone ported to Toxx, run to Hole, egress to zone, regroup, and refight your way back to your spot.<br>
<br>
Other than those kind of situations/obligations, the guild call takes priority over everything else, especially in zones like OT or LGuk, or wherever where it is really easy to get a replacement or figure out an alternative plan. <p><center><img src=http://members.aol.com/kattriaminx/kattsig25.gif></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AADDDD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=marilisseadsagsona>Marilisse Adsagsona</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/30/01 5:48:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilds &gt; group</span><hr size=1> Ok, I'm part of a small, very close knit guild, so my situation and opinions may be a little different from those of you in larger guilds, but I do think that ones first loyalty should be to their guild, within reason. The reason you (or at least my friends) are in guilds is to work together and have a group of friends and comrads that you can depend on, so when they need you, you go help. However, you shouldn't just disband from a group with no warning or a very curt one. Explain your situation to the group and try to wait until they find a replacement if possible. But sometimes that is just not feasible, and as long as you are polite about it, and explain what's going on, most people aren't going to get too mad. <br>
On the other hand, you are right about people using it as an excuse. There isn't a whole lot that can be done about that. If only everyone would just be honest and admit that they aren't happy or having fun or the exp isn't good enough, or whatever the situation may be, the game and grouping all together would be a lot simpler. It is for this very reason or reasons like it that I, like many people I know, don't like pick-up groups. Ninja looting, selfishness, and rudeness make grouping difficult, which makes it hard for the good natured people who really want to do things right.<br>
Just my opinions.<br>

If you treat it that way you have very little respect for others around you.  You can't tell me that every time you leave a group to help your guild that you could not wait 10-20 mins.  When I was playing and exp hunting if I was needed I asked them how long and are they sure they need me.  I then give notice that I have to go in X time to help a guild mate.<br>
<br>
Yes when you have to make a call go guild/friends, but that does not mean you can't show respect to those that kept you alive. <p><br>

Sorry but if I just found you in a random zone &amp; you wanted another &amp; I was available please don't think I won't become unavailable if I am needed/wanted elsewhere. It's the breaks kido's, deal with it. <p><center><IMG
