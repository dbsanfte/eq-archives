Kaiyn frowned and peeked his head around the corner, his vision slightly foggy from the exhaustion of several hours of nearly continuous fighting.  He motioned his group to keep a distance.  &quot;Hail a dar ghoul knight,&quot; he announced as he saw what he had suspected was guarding the back door to the crypt in sebilis.  Vaguely he could make out what appeared to be a pet, standing guard beside the powerful undead frog.  Nodding to his party he stepped out into the hallway and charged at the froglok, catching it off guard just long enough to swing his Ykeshan Warclub into a kneecap while bashing its head with a Cane of the Tranquil.  Despite the force behind the blows and the floating skulls of a Ykesha effect laughing viciously about its body, the Dar Ghoul Knight responded with an angry &quot;Ribbit&quot; and began swinging its claws at Kaiyn with blinding speed and deadly accuracy.  Kaiyn had no fear however. Between Krilan's healing, Alderon's blasts of magic, Ugglieu's ability to slow the frog's attacks, Mesric's ability to make Kaiyn's reflexes respond like tightened springs, and Greyson's knowledge of anatomy to place incredible backstabs, he was well protected.  It was then that something happened that Kaiyn should have prepared for.  The froglok's eyes gleamed with sudden fury and without warning Kaiyn's body was wracked with pain.  Pain so intense and so sudden he nearly dropped his weapons.  Before he could recover fully, a second jolt of horrible agony shot throughout his bones, causing his hands to tighten convulsively about his weapons, and his jaw to clench so tightly that he nearly bit through his tongue.  A second undead froglok had heard the attack from just beyond the door to the crypt, and had caught Kaiyn and his party off guard.  Kaiyn was now at the brink of death, barely able to stand as he continued to attack the first Dar Ghoul Knight.  Realizing he had been harm touched twice and knowing that both frogs were out for his blood, he did the only thing he could think of to give Krilan the time for a heal.  He assumed an evasive fighting style.  Suddenly it seemed as if everything around him slowed down.  His body twisted and turned around claws and teeth and he seemed to see attacks coming before they were made.  To his companions his body seemed a blur of motion, striking less often but dodging nearly everything.  He only needed those few seconds as he was bathed in a divine light of healing.  The second froglok was simultaneously mesmerized as Mesric brought his dominating will down upon the creature.  Greyson silently moved around to stand behind the froglok Kaiyn was fighting and deftly thrust his rapier into a rotting kidney, producing a pain filled scream from the Dar Ghoul Knight.  As his rapier made contact, the froglok's attacks were distracted from the group by a swarm of insects that materialized about its head.  Kaiyn grinned evily at the first Dar who was no longer looking so confident.  A pillar of holy energy surrounded him as Krilan completely healed him, the cuts and burns vanishing as if they had never been.  It was then that a torrent of fire and ice began to rain upon the dar, slashing through its skin and causing the stones beneath its feet to first freeze, then glow red with heat.  Alderon's body was surrounded in a halo of blazing energy that caused the hair on Kaiyn's back to stand up.  Now it was the Dar Ghoul Knight who could barely stand.  Grinning Kaiyn planted a firm kick into it's knee, causing it to colapse just as Greyson drew his long blade back and drove it firmly through the back of its head. It hung there for a moment and then slid limply off of the thin blade, twitching briefly before laying still. The mesmerized froglok stared dreamily into space, having forgotten totally about the battle.  Refreshed and awake by this moment of excitement, the adventurers calmly moved to surround the monster, the air crackling with energy and filled with chanting.  <br>
<br>
'Today has been a good day.' Kaiyn thought to himself as he prepared to attack.<br>
