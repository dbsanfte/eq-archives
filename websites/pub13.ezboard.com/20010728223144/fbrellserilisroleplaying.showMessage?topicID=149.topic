Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness and she could make out the shapes of the pillars surrounding the sanctuary.  She listened for the coming of her God but all she heard was the snoring of Grandfather Tobias off in the corner.  She wondered if she should wake him up.  Maybe Rodcet Nife wouldn't come if Grandfather had fallen asleep in his prayers.   Or maybe He was waiting until Grandfather was asleep before he came for her.  Caedusia wished she knew.<br>
<br>
She was chilled. Though the marble where she lay had warmed itself to her body, she wished she had a blanket.  She thought about sitting up, but what if that was wrong.  What if her God would not come.  She lay perfectly still trying hard to obey.  She listened to the steady rhythm of Grandfather's breathing and began to pray.  &quot;Father Nife, I'm being the best I know how to be.  It's cold and I'm tired but they said I mustn't sleep.  I don't know what to do.  Please come for me.  I want you to take me and make my mommy better.  Please.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was a childish prayer, but one from the heart.  The kind of honest prayer the Gods cannot help but answer.  A violet column of light suddenly appeared and Caedusia sat up, startled.  She watched a man step out, a humble man, not a God at all.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You look cold, child&quot;  he said and handed her a coarse tunic of loosely woven linen.  &quot;Put this on.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They said I must go to my God naked,&quot; she answered.<br>
<br>
The man smiled.  &quot;Your God wouldna have you freeze.  He'll know of your obedience.  Go on, now, put it on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia took the tunic and put it on.  It was warm, as though it had just come from an oven.  Cadusia hugged it to her and luxuriated in the warmth.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man smiled and reached out his hand.  &quot;Will you come with me, lass?&quot;   <br>
<br>
Caedusia looked into the corner where Grandfather Tobias slept to seek his approval.  But the corner was empty and she could no longer hear his breathing.  She looked back at the humble man.  He wore a tunic like the one he had given her.  He was thin, his face plain.  But his smile radiated affection. Caedusia hopped off the altar and took his hand.  Together they walked into the violet column and out onto a road running between two freshly planted fields.  A farmhouse stood in the distance.  <br>
<br>
Caedusia watched the wheat and corn grow in the fields as they walked.  It was a warm spring day with a hint of rain in the air.  &quot;Karana must bless this farm,&quot; Caedusia said to the man.  <br>
<br>
He laughed.  &quot;Aye, that he does.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What's your name?&quot;  Caedusia asked as they turned along the road and headed toward the barn.<br>
<br>
&quot;They call me Rod.&quot;  he answered.  &quot;And you are Caedusia Talisman, are you not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia looked at him surprised.  &quot;Yes.  How do you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, you're famous here.  The child who gave her life for her mother.  Not all little girls would do that, you know.&quot;  Rod looked at her and smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I just hope it's enough and Father Nife will heal her.&quot;  Caedusia said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, child, he already has.  How could any father turn down such a heartfelt request.  Ahhh, here we are,&quot; Rod said as they approached the barn.  A handsome lad of about sixteen was brushing down a horse.  &quot;I want you to meet my second son&quot; he said.  &quot;Seamus, this is Caedusia.&quot; <br>
<br>
Seamus took off his cap and bowed.  &quot;I've heard about you.  Good to have you with us, lass,&quot; he said and then returned to his work.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever seen a colt born?&quot;  Rod asked Caedusia.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you're about to see one now, young Caedusia.  The mare's been in labor all night but she's having a hard time of it.  Come inside.&quot;  Rod took Caedusia inside the barn to a stall in the far back.  She could hear the whinies of the mare.  When Rod opened the door, a woman holding the mare's head looked up and the two boys massaging her stomach moved aside.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a breach.  I dunna think she'll live.&quot;  said the woman stroking the mare's head.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's a good mare,&quot; Rod said to Caedusia.  &quot;'Twould be a shame to lose her.  Would you like to pet her lass?&quot; Rod asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's beautiful.  Can I?&quot;  Caedusia asked.<br>
<br>
The woman moved aside to give Caedusia room.  Caedusia sat down and began to stroke the mare's neck.  She moved down the horse and began to stroke it's bulging stomach.  She stroked gently and the mare seemed calmed by Caedusia's ministrations.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Turn the colt, lass&quot;  Rod told her.  <br>
<br>
Without thinking, Caedusia felt the bulging colt within the mare.  She felt the hard solid mass that would be it's rump, down near the birth canal.  Caedusia pushed with all her might and felt a surge of energy flow through her body as though she had been struck by lightning.  The rump gave way and the colt flipped.  The mare gave out a loud whinney and pushed  the head of the colt out into the world.  The two stable boys pulled the rest of the colt free and it stood on trembling legs, all covered in a thick white paste.  <br>
<br>
Caedusia jumped behind Rod as the mare took to its feet. Rod and the woman laughed.  &quot;Nothing to be afraid of, lass.  That mare won't hurt you.  She'll always know you now and she'll step gently.&quot;  Rod put his arm around Caedusia shoulder and hugged her slightly.  &quot;Now, let's get you inside and get you settled.&quot;<br>
