As a cleric, if I am rezzin..anywhere...I rez away from people.  And I dont start rezzin where ppl are pulling.  <br>
<br>
I think it is nice of anyone to rez/buff/whatever for free, but doing one type of charitable act, does not excuse another type of Jackassian behavior.  Don't care how bad a person's temper is.  Rezzing for free, doesnt give someone the right to KS someone who ticked you off.<br>
<br>
I would suggest tho, that if someone asks you to move, for whatever reason, instead of bein /rude, you ask what's up and see if there is a valid reason...and maybe, you will make a friend instead of an enemy.  <br>

I want to make a couple things clear:<br>
<br>
1) There is NO good reason to KS someone, except that they KSed you first.<br>
<br>
2) I was pulling to there before he came along.<br>
<br>
3) My Bard is not 35, she was 42 at the time I think, it says it in my sig, i would never aggro more than one mob and pull it to the zone because I can outun any mob in OT, so i lose the mobs and bring back the one I want.<br>
<br>
4) NOBODY has the right to tell someone where they can and can't pull to, if you don't like it then go somewhere else, KSing a mob is not the way to handle the situation.<br>
<br>
5) I asked him politely NOT to root my mobs. <p><P>

Well were talking about the SF tunnel, firstly you can't solo-pull mobs if a goon agros.. secondly the distance isn't all that great from the outpost to the tunnel to totally lose agro. (i mean lose it with 100% safety)<br>
<br>
I agree ksing was no way to handle the situation (hmm tell me if you need my post in simpler terms for you to understand)<br>

He was doing the zone a favour, and the more people with your attitude &quot;So I tell him to mind his own business (in other words /snicker)&quot; is it any wonder that less and less people are prepared to stay in low level zones and offer a free service to people.<br>
<br>
Maybe I should add a few cuss words and put downs in this post, just to reinforce the 'flame' side of my posts and make it clearer for those not as enlightened as your great self..<br>

I sure as hell wouldn't trust the judgement of someone I don't know to do this.  Is he expected to trust you know how to pull, to control your pulls, to not pull agro stuff, not bring goons, AND be nice enough to do all those things?  In his place I wouldn't.<br>

Rather blanket statement there.  This isn't a single player game; EVERYONE has at least some small say in what others do, because it affects them in some way.  How much say they have is really the only thing you can argue about.<br>

Morkenlar, you are right about people being able to tell other people things, doesn't mean that I have to listen though, and as I said before, rooting/KSing my mobs is not the way to handle someone not doing what you tell them to do.<br>
<br>
I'm not KOS to Goons, if a goon aggroed on a mob I was pulling it would kill the mob most likely, what level are these goons?  50+? <p><P>

<br>
Those 4 'flame' comments you quoted:<br>
<br>
The last 2 were posted after your &quot;flame me some more&quot; comment.<br>
<br>
The first comment was a half question half observation, and the mature comment.. sure it can be classed as a flame.  It was a response to your quote basically saying you told him to go @#%$ himself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> you are right about people being able to tell other people things, doesn't mean that I have to listen though<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your right, you don't HAVE to.  Just like we don't HAVE to honour your camps, or respect your named mobs etc.  It's called morals, decency, and respect for others.<br>
<br>
Just a question...  if I was going to do the kromriff legs quest in GD, and asked you to move away from the fort for a short while, would you move away and let the quest work, or stand there saying &quot;damnit dont tell me what to do&quot; and screw it up?<br>

BS.  Just by posting here and giving his name you made it a flame.<br>
<br>
If you wanted an honest answer, you would have posted an example scenario, and not in the Rants and Flames thread.<br>

My corpse was in West karana and i was bound in FV, my corpse was gonna rot cause no one would port me.  So i did a /who all cleric and asked about 20 of them that were close to WK if they can rezz me, and none of them responded.  So I asked AZZAZON as a joke , because he was in velious.<br>
To my surprise he said yes. Azzazon made the trek from velious to WK to track down my corpse (hehe forgot to mention I forgot to /L before i died) just to rezz me.  He wasn't from my guild only met him once before, and he didnt charge me for the rezz he even got killed in NK by a mob...<br>
<br>
Soo to say this guy is a jerk or tryin to ruin this mans honor by your petty complaints, give him a tell when ur at your bind point and cant get a rezz cause of the rest of the clerics are jerks and wont rezz ya even tho ur corpse is a foot away from them or the zoneline.  I've only known a few other clerics like him.<br>
<br>
As for your run in with Azzazon well maybe u took it the wrong way or u got on his bad side when he told ya to move hehe.  And ohh yeah its only a game so dont take it like ur gonna have a stroke.   Why dont ya bitch about somethin like &quot;Why Amazon.com has not sent me my SOL expansion?  They charged me for next day delivery.&quot; <br>

<br>
1.) He didn't flame anyone who disagreed with any of his points...in fact he was admittant to the fact that he could be wrong.  This was until someone took a rather condecending tone towards him...in which case he retaliated, and not to harshly actually.<br>
<br>
2.) This is an old thread, and Jezebell is still very much a member of EA, and to my knowledge has remained very loyal, commited, and helpful to them despite some upfront misgivings and warnings from other guild/people of prexus.<br>
<br>
/hug Jeze<br>

He wasn't kicked out,and for the whole 12hours that he might have gone without a EA tag was a result of lots of built up frustrations and a /guildremoval on Jez's part.<br>
Once things were sorted out and Jez had time to cool off (/hugs Jez),he was promtly back in EA where he belongs.<br>
Next time ask someone first before assuming you big lug.<br>
