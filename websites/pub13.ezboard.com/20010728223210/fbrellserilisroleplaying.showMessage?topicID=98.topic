<br>
It all began when Deav was a little child growing up in the grim and silent town of Neriak. His first step began getting to know his home town and this is where the young Deavian would begin his long journey from being a boy to becoming a man. <br>
<br>
As he ventured he ended up in the dark and misty forest of Nektolus. This is where he met his first kindred spirits. Young lads and gals hoping for fame and fortune in this mass world of Norrath. Little did he know that this cruel and dark forest would be where he should meet friends who would join him in his journeys around Norrath. Deav and his friends learned a lot the first couple of days and went home to Neriak to tell everyone about there adventures at the local tavern. Some of the old folks in town laughed at there tails and of what they had accomplished.<br>
<br>
This would however not discourage our friends as they decided to venture even further out of Nektolus dark and evil breath to the land of East commons. The sun burned young Deavians eyes as he had never seen it, before this day. As this was new to our friends they decided to stay close to the dark and cold forest but to them it was home and a place of refuge. Our young friend Deavian wandered carefully about, looking for something him and his friends could play with. Wasn't long before he found what he was looking for and took it to his friends, as he grew more familier with the area he ventured even further but only to discover there were light dwellers that didn't appreciate the interference of the dark skinned folks. The light dweller chased Deav and his friends back into the forest where the where safe since the light dwellers wouldn't dare to enter this dark forest.<br>
<br>
Many days passed in the east commons and surrounding areas which looked a lot alike and our young friend had taken his leave of his friends but little did he know he would see them again some day. He also became very skilled and learned a lot in a matter of few days.<br>
<br>
As he wandered alone through this harsh land he ran into his first light dweller who seemed to be in trouble as she was yelling for help. A huge bear had surprised her and she was badly wounded. Deav was careful since light dwellers didn't seem to like him but he went closer. The bear would be a challenge even for our young Deavian but one he would be able to overcome but insteed of helping the little girl in need of help he decided to play her a cruel joke, for all the wrong the light dwellers had done him. He walked up to her and asked if she needed his assistence? She quickly answered with a 'Yes, please!' Deavian then said to her 'I thought so' and turn his back on her leaving her to die in the claws of the bear. <br>
<br>
Little did he know he would come to like some of these light dwellers and even get friends among them but our young Deavian was just that, young.<br>
<br>
The End<br>
