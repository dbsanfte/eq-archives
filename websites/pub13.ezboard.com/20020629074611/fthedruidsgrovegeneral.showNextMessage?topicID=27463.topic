I didn't realize it was you til after I posted this, so it may not help you much... leaving it up in case it's useful to someone else. (/edit)<br>
<br>
Assuming the druid debuffs are all cast by the same druid, or druids of the same level:<br>
<br>
1) Cast RFS to lower mob fire resist, and to help you land the next 2 debuffs<br>
2) Cast Fixation.  This stacks.<br>
3) Cast RSD.  This overwrites RFS, and is basically an upgrade.  Again, it's important to cast RFS first so Fixate and RSD stick more easily.<br>
4) Cast Breath of Ro.  This further debuffs the mob, stacks.<br>
5) I have not tried stacking immolate with Fixate, RSD, and BoR.  It hardly seems worth it, when I have back-up healing, etc to deal with.  Someone wanna comment on this?<br>
<br>
So when I'm done, the mob is Fixated (ac/attk debuff), Dysjunctioned (Fire resist debuff), Breathed (more FR debuff, more melee debuff), and theoretically, could be immolated too... but I'd never tried.  RFS has been overwritten by RSD, but it served its purpose by helping to stick the first two fire-based debuffs.<br>
<br>
There are stacking issues that arise when druids of different levels try to stack debuffs.  I won't go into it because it makes my head hurt, but as a general rule, don't try it.<br>

<br>
Thank you Lotusfly (again I might add)<br>

<br>
Chaps, I am, quite frankly, amazed. It seems to me that I'm playing a slightly different class to some of the posters here, at least from personal experience. The amount of incorrect information represented here as fact is a little worrying; I've been reading down the posts thinking &quot;Good lord&quot; and &quot;Wherever does that idea come from?&quot; and so forth. Let me do as I can to respond to some of you. I must admit to being puzzled at some of the responses, but perhaps we can iron this out to some satisfaction. <br>
<br>
I'd like you guys to be happy, and I want you to share a little of the feeling that I, and my druids, feel when we're smacking the baddies of Norrath.<br>
<br>
I think what would be most productive of all in trying to communicate this would be to give you some case studies. I see a lot of confusion in the above posts, perhaps this will give you a little glimpse into the way in which druids are useful. To quote a senior member of development staff, &quot;I like the way druids turned out, if I were levelling another class to 60 I'd make it a druid&quot;. I can't help but agree; maybe these case studies will help express my opinion.<br>
<br>
As a little background, these are case studies from the &quot;uber&quot; guild of our server, much as I dislike the word. With the new expansion, our druids are a big asset and something that I wouldn't like to be without. From these studies I hope to show you that at the very pinnacle of the end-game, even then druids are a great addition to the raid force. <br>
<br>
This is a long post, some people will not want to read it - that's fine. It's long because I care about the class, and I care about you all enjoying it even just a fraction as much as I do. <br>
<br>
<br>
1. The Temple of Ssraeshza.<br>
<br>
This is a great zone for druids, and one of the focal raid points of the new expansion. Mobs here have an enormous Ac, so much so that the melee classes are constantly saying how little fun it is hitting for 1, 1, 1, 5.<br>
<br>
Let's take the Creator as an example. He's a massive fight, and exhibits the usual traits of Ssra fights: high ac, high HP, AEs with a curse that makes all heals on you only heal for 20% of normal, and AEs for damage too.<br>
<br>
During this fight, melees are suffering because of the high Ac. The main tank is suffering because of the &quot;Balance of Zebuxoruk&quot; curse - every CH that lands on them is only healing 2k HP, every DL that lands on them is healing about 200HP. Everyone is suffering from the HP drain, HP bars are slowly and steadily falling all around. The fight lasts for some 15 minutes, so this is a problem. It's generally a hard place to be.<br>
<br>
Most clerical mana is tied up with the main tank. The rest of the raid force is scrounging heals from shamen and druids. As tanks fall, the shamen (a notoriously unpopular class across all servers, averaging 1-3 per uber guild) are rebuffing them, whilst trying to keep the Creator slowed and crippled. They don't have a great deal of mana for heals, but sometimes they can squeeze out a Torpor on a lucky caster.<br>
<br>
Druids do a lot during this fight, I'll cover some further points in a moment - for now let's look at the healing.<br>
<br>
It's the druids that are keeping alive a large portion of the raid force for this encounter. We're not main healers, we can't effectively keep someone alive that's tanking a 500+ hitting mob, nor were we intended to. Thankfully, 90% of the raid force are not tanking, and that's where we come in.<br>
<br>
HPs are dropping all around; I usually have druids healing a collection of rogues, casters, hybrids as most guilds do. During this time, the druid is dealing with HP bars that are falling over 15 minutes. They are spending their mana on Chloro/NT and keeping their group alive. They do a good job currently; with Flowing Thought and Mental Clarity, Healing Adept/Gift and good, plain mana management, our druids can cope. <br>
<br>
Of course we have the full range of druids - from those with a lot of time to get exp with all of the above boons, to those who can't play as much as they'd like and so have lesser attributes. All cope well with the task of keeping their group alive in a painful AE. Those with better attributes get to do more, which I'll come to. <br>
<br>
During this time, as in a lot of fights across Norrath, the AE is slowly eating your group over an extended period of time - extended because the mob has a serious amount of HPs, as is common at this point in the game.<br>
<br>
Rather than spending mana on NT and Chloro, our druids will be using Nature's Recovery as much as they can to save mana (once it stacks with regrowth). At this stage of the game, I trust that our druids can judge when a player has taken 900 HP of damage. <br>
<br>
This fight is not unique. Most encounters, a druid will be grouped with people that have taken 900HP of damage, or can anticipate that they will take 900HP of damage. My druids will get 100% healing utilisation out of Nature's Recovery nearly every time that they cast it, because they know from experience where the heals are needed. Every time they do cast it, they're saving mana. <br>
<br>
An above poster seemed to imply that it was difficult to judge the group's HPs, and that getting maximum utilisation out of NR would be a difficult thing to do. I don't agree with that; even the druid with the most humble skills on my raids can get 100% utilisation from this spell.<br>
<br>
Across this Creator fight, they will be saving 150mana every 1.5 mins, or 1500 mana across the total 15 minute encounter. Each and every druid will have 1-2 bubbles of extra mana to use, simply because of this new spell. <br>
<br>
Yes, you're don't have Torpor. The shamen have bigger fish to fry, on the whole, than watching group HPs. Across most encounters that I watch on various servers, the shamen have their attention elsewhere. They have an efficient heal-over-time heal, but by no means is it making the druid redundant on raids. The druids are contributing 100% and without them a large number of the raid force would be languishing at their bind points.<br>
<br>
That's the druid exercising the healing portion of their class on raids. We're not all-out fully-specialised healers (clerics), and so we don't do it as well as them. However, we do have a massive and pronounced effect on the raid.<br>
<br>
Let's move on to looking at how the druid exercises the other portions of their class skills on the raid. Whilst the cleric is healing 100%, the druid gets to do some other things - that's the trade off. I wouldn't want to be a cleric, it would drive me mad. Most clerics that I talk to find their class unsatisfying as they have been reduced to a simple button-pushing mechanism when their spot on the CH rotation comes around.<br>
<br>
Before we go into a major fight like the Creator, I like to have a bit of fun. I call a &quot;druid huddle&quot;, and all the druids form into one group temporarily, form a little circle and crouch, as in a little huddle in American Football. <br>
<br>
Here, we have a bit of fun. We have five debuffs, all of which need to be cast, and in a specific order. These debuffs make a big difference, which I'll cover in a moment. Depending on the number of druids on the raid, and what other tasks they have, we split the tasks accordingly. The tasks are split to share the mana load (some of the following are real mana drains to keep up over 15 minutes) and to share the agro load (some of the following will get you killed if one druid tries to keep to many up for 15 minutes).<br>
<br>
i. Sunder in first - thanks to its &quot;lurish&quot; resistance check, this spell will land the easiest and, after malo, makes the rest of our debuffs land nicely. An early cast, this is agrolicious.<br>
<br>
ii. Fixation in second - and down goes the mob's ATK by 60, and its ac by 18. This is a low maintenance debuff, the druid will only need to refresh it once during the fight - but it is vital that it is refreshed *before it fades*, otherwise it won't stick.<br>
<br>
iii. Disjunction in third - and this is the reason it won't stick if it is allowed to fade. Disjunction will overwrite Sunder, and leave Fixation, for a massive ATK debuff total of 120. I'll run some logs of a creature with and without the 120 ATK debuff on it, and you can see the damage output difference vs. a main tank. The Ac of the mob has gone down a further 27, on top of Fixation's 18, also.<br>
<br>
iv. and v. Breath of Ro and Immolate - Breath is a big mana drain for 15 minutes and is high agro over that time. The druid that keeps this up needs to have their other duties as low-agro and low-mana load; typically, if a druid has a cleric in their group they'll be getting Breath duty. Breath drives down the FR of the mob by a further 31, and takes a big 21ac chunk out of it. Immolate is less strenuous in terms of agro and mana, but requiries a lot of recasting - and it takes a further 18ac chunk.<br>
<br>
Once the druids have gone to work, the mob is suffering from:<br>
<br>
- 84 ac reduction. On all mobs, reducing the ac by this much (no other class can come close to such a reduction) causes a satisfying jump in melee damage from your 30 or so melees that are swinging away on the mob. Throw in a shamanic Cripple (-33ac), a necro's group AC tap (1 etc., and the mob is suffering from heightened raid melee, mostly thanks to the druids.<br>
<br>
It brings a smile to my face when our main tanks and rogues are shouting &quot;Is the AC down?&quot; in guild, and the druids can say &quot;Yes!&quot;. We're effectively buffing the melee output of the raid.<br>
<br>
- 98 FR reduction. This is pure evil. The battery of wizards are landing wave after wave of fire based nukes on the mob, magicians, druids and rangers are all getting massively reduced resists on their attacks and debuffs, and the necros are landing Funeral Pyre. This is something we're all accustomed to, to some degree, with Sunder (-42 FR) being so commonly used. With the full range of druid debuffs in, with coordination between the druids, the FR is down by over double that. It's just plain evil.<br>
<br>
- 120 ATK reduction. We've effectively knocked several levels off the mob in conventional melee terms. Versus a suitable main tank, the mob will hit less frequently, and for a lower amount of damage when he does so.<br>
<br>
And that's just the debuffing. Sunder, Fixation and Disjunction are low-maintenance. Breath and Immolate are heavy tasks. Remember that we've not counted the damage - over 15 minutes Breath will do 13.8k of damage, Immolate will do 3.6k. <br>
<br>
One druid will get Swarm duty (just over 20k of damage in 15 mins), one druid will optionally throw on a free Drones of Doom (5k over 15 mins). <br>
<br>
It is typical to give &quot;Remove Greater Curse&quot; scrolls to druids - they are a hugely rare spell. If you have one copy of this spell for your guild, as is likely, it will mean tying up on character 100% of the time casting it on the main tanks, curing the Balance of Zeb curse. Without this, the main tanks die fast. Shamen are in too short supply to spend one on curse curing, clerics are needed for their 100% heals - across most servers, Remove Greater Curse has gone to a druid. It's another duty for us, and without it the raid will (literally) be dead and be dead fast.<br>
<br>
Any druids with leftover mana we have throw in extra wildfires. Simply casting wildfire alone, a druid can do 1k of damage every 6 seconds - you can click a Shrunken Goblin Earring in between casts to remove the recast delay for back-to-back quick casts. That's a higher amount of damage than a rogue or a monk in an equivalent period (assuming 140 and 120 dps respectively for uber rogues and monks). Certainly, you have a mana and agro price to pay for such high damage, but my point is that you are making a real contribution to damage. That your nuke is has a smaller mana/damage ratio than a wizard nuke is no surprise and irrelevant - it amazes me how one can write off druid DDs when they can outdamage the guild's best equipped rogues should you wish to, over the period of time in which you cast them.<br>
<br>
After the duties are assigned, and the druids are excited, we dance a little, goof around, and then rejoin our groups and get to work.<br>
<br>
Druids are are a versatile class. We don't heal 100%, we do have a wonderful mix of decent healing, decent nukes, decent DoTs and excellent debuffs which specialise in an area no others do (Ac, Atk, FR).<br>
<br>
When the dust settles and we're awarding another FT6 shield to a lucky caster, the druids have their heads held up high and send me tells saying &quot;GD I love being a druid&quot; and &quot;Hell they've made us good now&quot;.<br>
<br>
I love it.<br>
<br>
That's to counter the &quot;Omg we suck on raids&quot;, &quot;Sigh... our nukes aren't so good&quot;, &quot;All I do on raids is regen and then pump 880 heals&quot; and so on. It's as good as you make it, and I wouldn't be without my core of druids for taking on the big mobs.<br>
<br>
As a subnote, I should answer &quot;Omg clerics have mass group buff now so no one needs potg, I'm useless&quot;. If you believe this, and if your guild casters, shamen and druids are using aegolism rather than PotG... I really don't know what to say to you.<br>
<br>
In my guild, the drill is as follows.<br>
<br>
The cleric will cast group aego on the whole raid, for 4 peridots - I love this! The peridot saving is enormous for us so far.<br>
<br>
I have a &quot;/gu Potg is in 5 mins, click off your aego if you need it&quot; which I then hit. Two mins later I hit my &quot;/gu Potg is in 3 mins, click off your aego if you need it&quot;. Finally, they get a &quot;/gu Potg is inc, click off your aego if you need it&quot; hotkey. This has to happen once every 2.5 hours (group aego's duration). It's not a big deal, and it helps me to gte our usually AFK casters to click their buff off. I then PotG all the mana users (less some clerics).<br>
<br>
PotG is 60 mana/minute, or 900 mana over a 15 minute Creator fight (for example). If your casters are using aego, I'd do something about it. <br>
<br>
Saving 900 mana per caster, assuming 20 casters... 18k mana regenned over a Creator fight which is being spent on other things: nukes, mod rods, CHs, DoTs, etc. Your guild needs to use PotG.<br>
<br>
That's the role of druids on my raids.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Exp groups<br>
<br>
This one will be shorter, fear not. <br>
<br>
Currently, the exp spot of choice for most of us is dear old Howling Stones. I form a group here and get a yellow every 35 mins or so, it really is fast exp. When I'm forming the group I get the following:<br>
<br>
Group slot 1: Me (hehe)<br>
<br>
Group slot 2: Rogue #1 - luckily, my usual levelling partner and a Mrylokar's dagger user. <br>
<br>
Group slot 3: Tank, preferably a paladin. The group heals really work in the middle of a big train - Wave of Prexus keeps us all safe when we really need it, and it keeps the agro on the paladin.<br>
<br>
Group slot 4: Enchanter or bard. I prefer an enc, as it allows us to AE when we have mana. Bards can do this to a good extent with AE slow, but with an enchanter's AE stun and 75-mana AE mez you're best set.<br>
<br>
Group slot 5: Cleric. You can do without a cleric and get another rogue, or a shaman, but we can keep south and south-east wings clear every cycle with a cleric, and it's just a good safety buffer for the group. Plus, symbol lets me pull big trains to AE. <br>
<br>
Group slot 6: Misc. damage. Ideally another rogue, a monk, or our usual necro with Dire Charm. All are great choices.<br>
<br>
Important note: I would not advocate group efficiency over fun. I'm the biggest supporter of varied groups, doing things that you shouldn't be able to, with the weirdest classes.<br>
<br>
However, if it's an average day and you just want exp as fast as you can get it, I usually at least aim for the above in Charasis, even if it's just a vague outline of a group.<br>
<br>
I should emphasise again that I both enjoy and strongly support, and always have done, the more unusual type of group make-up. Friendships and fun are always more important than exp. If a second cleric asks to come along, for example - sure. They can play wizard. <br>
<br>
During this time, I usually pull. Having the melees stop fighting to pull is a shameful waste of melee power. I'd rather a caster out pulling than seeing a monk, rogue or tank peel off from the group to hunt out some more baddies to pull. The enchanter usually dies too quickly on pulls (hehe), the cleric often needs to med from the enormous trains of mobs that come crashing around the groups' ears. That leaves the druid. <br>
<br>
I'm always taking damage, pulling. From HTs, from casts, from melee - I am always damaged, and even with regrowth and a fungal tunic the regen is never enough. I will always keep NR up on myself in this situation, and will save me a lot of mana in keeping me topped up - the cleric is usually spending mana on the group or AEing when I pull trains. I'll also keep NR up on the tank, thus increasing the amount of time between cleric CHs.<br>
<br>
I can pretty much guarantee a 100% usage rate of NR in my exp groups (when it stacks as intended). That's a nice mana saving. <br>
<br>
On a side note, I remember a while ago hearing bad things about Entrapping Roots (our level 60 AE root) and Bonds of Tunare (AE snare). In exp groups, these spells get a constant work out, and I'm glad they exist. <br>
<br>
Exping, the melees don't pull (as mentioned), the cleric needs to med, the enchanter needs to stay for mezzes and fragility. I pull in most groups, assuming we're just grinding exp. <br>
<br>
I'll pull a few 'traditional' pulls, of 1-2, keeping the melees stocked with mobs, and with the enchanter keeping some 'on ice' for the melees to turn on next. When mana is generally good, usually once every ten minutes, I'll pull a train of 5-8 mobs. When I reach the group, I can AE root and keep everything down. The casters can back off and get some space, I can go and pull more if need be, plus I have done a really efficient amount of damage (200 mana for some 1k of root damage). That's 1:5 damage, usually. DoTs are 1:4, nukes are 1:3. AE root is pretty good!<br>
<br>
AE snare is nice, in HS, to just ensure that everything is tied up. It's very cheap in terms of mana - it costs less than 3 ensnares, and the mobs are all dead before its even reach 50% duration. Certainly, runners don't matter so much in HS, when the wing is pretty much clear anyway, but it's a nice touch that your melees don't have to chase down spectres and feasters, and it doesn't cost much mana at all. It's no AE Root, but it's not bad - I've come to love both during my AA exp sessions in HS. <br>
<br>
Anyway, that's just a little aside.<br>
<br>
What a huge post. I'm sure most are asleep! Perhaps I've communicated why I'm excited about Nature's Recovery. I hope also I've countered the really rather frustrating &quot;Druids are hopeless on raids&quot; argument, by showing you exactly how much fun my druids really have on raids. We come out feeling like heroes and heroines.<br>
<br>
Throw in our massive usability outside raids, and I firmly believe that we are lucky enough to have levelled up one of the most enjoyable classes in the game. <br>

<br>
I would think that given the massive ac of luclin mobs ac debuffing would not make a quantifiable difference - but I am eager to be proven wrong.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the absence of group heals makes druids poor healers in an AoE situation - your average caster group would be better off with a paladin than a druid in a luclin aoe (discounting THO who can be overcome by fungi + ROTG).  The mana efficiency of NR pales against group heals.  <br>
<br>
Imho the only meaningful contribution a druid can make in luclin is as a diet-coke wizard - with a 3.5k mana pool, foci, SCMII &amp; SCFI  have over 30k of damage on a full load of moonfire without taking into account c3 &amp; FT.  That pales against a wizard using Elnericks (and no - afaik Ancient starfire of Ro is not in game or only drops in VT).<br>
<br>
I do appreciate the versatility of being able to play either a healer or a nuker - however I feel that druids cannot make a meaningful contribution as a healer except as a MT patcher on undebuffed flurry drakes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usashanna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sashanna</A> at: 5/29/02 12:36:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/29/02 3:43:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27429.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Debuffs stack on High end Mobs?</span><hr size=1> I've been a successful patch healer since I was early 50's.

If I was down to 200hps it would take me 1600mana (4x955 on NT) to heal myself.  With a 3.5k mana pool (which is big) thats still almost half my total mana pool to heal one player in a 6 person group (and I would still have 45hps unhealed).<br>
<br>
For me to heal a 7.4k tank (our MTs have ~7400hps fully buffed) from 200hps would cost 3200mana or basically my entire mana pool.  <br>

Assuming that I have a mixed group with an average hps of 5k and the entire group is at half health - it would take me 6kmana to heal the entire group to full (2500hps x 6/955 = 15 x 400).  There isnt a druid in EQ that has anything approaching 6k mana.<br>

Druid group healing in an aoe situation is a joke - and chloroblast is not more mana efficient than NT.<br>

In AE and rampage situations my setup is not all that uncommon, and is probably on the lower end of raiding druids.

<br>
Ok, true enough, but what people are missing here is that you won't EVER want to overwrite Fixation with Disjunction (this combination maximizes fire debuff).  To do that, you'd need to land Fixation before Sundering, which would mean that the mob isn't very fire resistant to begin with, and doing the uber-debuff-trick for fire debuffing is just dumb.<br>
<br>
Overwriting Sundering first, though, then doing Fixation and Disjunction is giving mele the extra edge, which is always good.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Nitpickers might point out that you could cast something before Sundering, then cast Fixation after the pre-debuff wears off, but before Sundering wears off.  This would have the effect of actually putting Fixation before Sundering on a mob that you otherwise might not be able to land Fixation on first.  Then you can go do the uber-debuff-trick for fire.  Honestly, though, I don't see this ever having any real application, and it can go wrong in many ways. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126501">Abru</a>, Elder Hierophant on The Nameless,  <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/index.shtml" target=_top>Legacy of Steel</a>, <a href="mailto:AbruEQ@hotmail.com">AbruEQ@hotmail.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukhardan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khardan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/29/02 8:10:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27429.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.csun.edu/~hbcsc544/roscoes.gif width=75 height=70></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Debuffs stack on High end Mobs?</span><hr size=1> Anyone know if there is a stacking issue with oos and rfs?<br>

The rampage dps on some Luclin mobs is higher than the total DPS on any mob in Vellious (with the sole exception of the AoW).  There are mobs that rampage harder than Tunare melees.  I find it unlikely that you are able to keep up with Luclin rampage damage on any major mob.<br>

I'm not necessarily a believer in that everything is as efficient and worthwhile as she put it in actual use.  What i mean is if fixation is only saving like 10hps/hit or something along these lines then imo its really not that worthwhile.  I understand every little bit helps, but again, i'm more of a practical person, and generally not worried about every little bit.  Its like i can stack immolation i think with my regular dots, yeah it'd help, but i hardly find it worth it.  <br>
<br>
I've used Fixation, not on boss mobs, but your average blue exp mobs, and never saw much of a difference, if at all.  I never parsed the logs, but as i understand it Fixation would probably have a greater impact on your average mob since the attack debuff is a fixed number.  <br>
<br>
I'm still not a believe in Natures Recovery, only in specific situations.  Does it help?  Of course.  Is it worth the hassle to use all the time in terms of actual usefulness?  Not really, its very situational imo, regardless of the mana savings.  I think the AE fighting definitely has a use for NR, but your going to have to pick and choose who will be the NR recipients unless you have a plethora of druids.  I do agree that its useful for pulling, i've used it for that, and its very handy.  However, i'll argue if its really worth the hassle of keeping on an MT, or multiple people in an exp group.  Its really hard for me to put into words, but in practical use its just not as great as people seem to make it out to be.  When i've used it, it hardly makes a difference in the rate we're killing.  I dont believe NR is equivalent to a direct heal wtih a much better mana efficiency, it just doesnt seem equal to me.  *sigh* i guess i cant really explain why other than saying in practical use, i dont see much of a difference maker using NR, only in specific situations.  I still believe its a pretty lame spell for lvl 60, maybe i'm clueless, but i know what i see when i've used it in every situation imaginable to make it work.  To be honest, i decide between NR, and mem'ing a stun as my last slot in exp groups, most of the time its a stun.<br>
<br>
I havent tried the AE roots and AE snares enough in places like HS, but i do remember the roots being resisted pretty often.  I just cant remember what mobs i played around with it on, so they could've been much tougher mobs than there are in HS.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing those points to nay-say or be negative.  I'm arguing them from what i've seen and experienced in actual use.  I'd love to see Lotusfly's guild in action though.  The coordination sounds impressive )<br>

<br>
CASE A:<br>

- Disjunction (this overwrite Sundering)<br>
<br>
CASE B: (not realistic)<br>
- Fixation<br>
- Sundering<br>
- Disjunction (this overwrite Fixtation)<br>
<br>
Short and sweet, Sundering gives you a whopping dose of fire-debuff, Fixation gives you a good dose of mele-debuff, and Disjunction gives you a dose of each (twice as good!).<br>
<br>
So, because of what you're overwriting, you get:<br>
<br>
CASE A: 2 x Mele-Debuff, 1 x Fire-Debuff<br>
CASE B: 1 x Mele-Debuff, 2 x Fire-Debuff<br>
<br>
Of course, you're actually getting an extra boost to fire debuff with Breath of Ro in either of the cases.<br>
<br>
The reason I'm saying that Case B isn't realistic is that you have to cast Fixation first to achieve it.  To cast Fixation first, the mob has to already be pretty susceptible to fire, and choosing the sequence that focuses on a whole lot of fire debuffing for a mob that is already "fire poosae" is kind of silly, particularly if you can instead opt to debuff mele a bit extra.<br>

I understand every little bit helps, but again, i'm more of a practical person, and generally not worried about every little bit.&quot;<br>

I understand where you're coming from with this perspective, as I feel much the same way.  But then again, the best guilds in EQ think about every single little detail and incorporate it into thier tactics.  It's the difference between an average guild, and an above average guild.  I have been trying to change my own mentality in reguards to many of the &quot;small things&quot; we and other classes do.  It's all about details and using the things other people overlook or take for granted.  Lotus's post is a prime example of this, but there are many others.<br>
