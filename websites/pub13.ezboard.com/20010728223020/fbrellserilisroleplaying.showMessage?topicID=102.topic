My father was a warrior and my mother stayed in the home, so I am told.  Although, I do not remember my mother or my older brother and sister, my father has been always ensured their memory was around us all the time.  <br>
<br>
While I was a baby, my father had been called to join a raid to the land of Perma Frost which is the tundra.  It is a dangerous place and has to be frequently cleaned out so to speak of the goblins that inhabit there.  I don’t remember any of that night, all I know is what has been told to me by neighbors and close friends of my father’s.  It was late in the night and my mother had already put myself and my older brother and sister to bed.  There was a knock at the door and my mother who was sure it was news of my father, answered the door.  It wasn’t not news of my beloved father, but a two men and another woman.  Just like us, I am told.  My mother, my brother, and sister were taken away.  I don’t know who these strange barbarians were.  All I know is when my mother cried for help, no one in Halas dared attempt to help.  There are rumors of strangers like us that do deeds for our God Tribunal, but the old barbarians do not speak of them and no one else is allowed to.  Why they were taken, where, or if they are alive, I do not know.  All I can hope is that someday I shall see them again, but not yet.<br>
<br>
So, I raised by my father who taught me respect and the gift of helping others.  We never wanted for much, it seems that Tribunal always more than adequately provided us with all that we needed except for our dear loved ones that were taken away from us. My father had always dreamed of having a member of the family that had the ‘gift’.  He always told me that there were many that had come from Halas, Oggok, and Grobb that had the gift.  But, did not fully understand what they were cabable of and used their gift in a selfish way.  At an early age, mine had been discovered and I was immediately taken to Marg who became my mentor.  My earliest memories of my childhood are very vivid.  The most memorable and special to me are evenings in our home in Halas.  My father would stoke the fire and light his pipe and the aroma from his pipe to my dying day I will not forget.  He would place me close to the fire and read to me stories of adventures in the land of Norrath.  He would read for what never seemed long enough and then send me to my studies.  The sound of the cackling fire and chilling wind outside seemed to mesmerize me as I read over the many books and scrolls that my father and Marg had picked out for me.  The scrolls were old and smelled of dust but, were so fascinating that it was hard to put them down.  The books were always new and crisp and smelled of the merchant’s shop in town where my father had purchased them.  It always seemed as if they were preparing me for something.  To this day, it still seems as if they are holding back, but on the very clear edge of telling me what my destiny is.  I ask them both when I am home and they continue to be elusive on the subject of what it is they have planned for me.  The people of Halas all know who I am and they treat me differently.  Whether it is fear or hate, I cannot tell.<br>
<br>
In the beginning, my days were spent with Marg at the academy studying.  The academy isn’t far from where the young warriors were sent to train.  It seemed so strange to me that while I was learning how to heal and to assist my brothers and sisters with spells of strength and agility, I heard their screams and moans of pain and suffering from mistakes they had made while learning the scared art of a barbarian warrior.  How I hated to hear their pain and wanted so much to try out my spell of healing just to take a small amount of pain away from their bruised and bashed bodies.  But, there were severe penalties for meddling with their teachings.  Then one day, the longing to observe this became too much for me.  My dear cousin and I ventured out to hid behind the stadium -like seating and hid from the many tutors and great warriors.  We had two spells that each of us had felt we had learned well enough to cast.  We had casted them on ourselves and each other of course, but never a real warrior.  Or even a warrior in training.  Those such deed were forbidden at our age.  <br>
<br>
As we observed, even afraid to breathe, I felt a desire that I had never felt to before to cast on one of these young warriors.  I couldn’t control my arms as the rose to begin casting of the blue aura began to come from my fingertips.   I had my eyes fixated on a young warrior who was a few years older than me.  He was slumped over and exhausted from his one-hand blunt teachings that he had been participating in.  In his dark soulful eyes was a physical pain that I could not begin to conceive.  His face was bloodied from the many battle wounds he had received in the past hour of training.  His leather apprentice armor was torn and frayed from the slashes of a marked and steady sword of his mentor.  His breathing was labored and shallow from the exhaustion of the physical battle his body was enduring.  There were locks of his dark hair that fell across his face that were frozen to his forehead and face.  While new perspiration was forming that seemed to free the frozen locks.  He swayed back and forth on his legs, almost as if there were no bones to hold him up.  At this point, our eyes locked and I could feel his pain for an instant.  The strands of blue crystal light coming from my fingers became stronger to my surprise and I was over-whelmed at the power coming from inside of me.  The aura engulfed and surrounded him.  As the blue light worked it’s way up his beaten and exhausted body, he began to straighten and the pain seemed to wash away from his face.  He was rejuvenated!  The cuts instantly closed themselves to a point where you couldn’t even tell they had been there.  His breathing returned to normal and the strength returned to his legs.  All that remained as evidence of this young brave warrior’s pain, who had seemed so close to death only moments ago, was the tattered green leather apprentice armor that he wore.  I looked down at my shaking hands and was overcome with a feeling of exhaustion that I had never felt before.  I had never experienced such mental exhaustion in my short and inexperienced life.  I was snapped out of my trance by my cousin who was dragging me through the new fallen snow of the stadium.  All he said was, “Kedina, do you know what you have done cousin?  We will surely be banished from the academy.  What were you thinking?!”  At one of the many exits of the stadium, I turned my head to see all eyes in the stadium scanning the area trying to figure out where the blue strands of healing had come from.  I smiled to myself as I ran through the streets of Halas to my father’s home knowing that I knew my power was great.  And, that I could not sustain any longer, no matter how hard I or anyone else tried.    <br>
<br>
Later that evening as I studied my worn and tattered scroll book, my father called for me to sit next to him at the fireplace.  He asked me if I had heard of the incident that occurred at the stadium that day.  I knew that I could not look into my father’s eyes and lie.  I had never been able too.  I replied to him that yes, I knew of what happened.  He then proceeded to ask me if I knew who the young shaman was that healed the warrior.  I told him that yes, I knew who she was.  Then my father did something that I will never forget.  He looked me in the eye with his cold, yet loving and so very clear blue eyes, and said, “My child, you are ready.”  Without another word, he rose and walked across our small home and removed the many bearskins they lay on top of the old wooden chest in the corner.  He rummaged through it for a few minutes, laying cherished family possessions and heirlooms gently on the cold stone floor beside him, that were carefully packed.  He pulled out what seemed to be a piece of jewelry that I had never seen before.  It was a black leather choker.  I had never laid my eyes on anything so captivating and beautiful in my life.  He told me the story of how my mother had been a great shaman and her powers were known far from of Everfrost all the way to the lands of Kunark.  She was wise, brave, and very powerful.  He told me stories of how she had risked her life many times to assist complete strangers and also those she loved.  As he clasped my mother’s most cherished possession around my neck, he did not need to explain the importance of this action or this moment.  It was unspoken.  At this time, I still did not understand my destiny, but I knew my path.<br>
