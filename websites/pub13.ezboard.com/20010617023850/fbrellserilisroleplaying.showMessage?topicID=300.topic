Since she had no way to practice she must just learn the dynamics so that she may use them later.  But quite often she would laugh now when reading a poem or love sonnet and catching a line of innuendo that was written in.<br>
<br>
Seeing that lessons of the heart were progressing well, it was time to introduce her to another form of defense, one that as a bard she would use quite often.  When you had an instrument in your hand it was hard to put it away and grab a weapon, often times you must protect your self with your hands.  Brenton had called in a favor or two and a monk of high regard was coming in to teach his young bard.  He smiled to himself as he moved to the gate to meet her new teacher, anticipating the reaction he would have on the ladies here and the girl herself.<br>
<br>
As he rounded the corner he smirked as he saw the man surrounded by some of the ladies of the temple.  He was a well-built man and knew it.  Training in his combat arts had honed his body to perfection and he had a rakish glint to his blue eyes.  Brenton suffered a pang of guilt in brining this man here as he was likely to be exhausted within a week by the ladies, but then, see how the monk handled them he figured he would manage somehow.<br>
<br>
He moved towards the man, “Arean, I am glad you could come.  I have heard nothing but wonderful things of your fighting and teaching and I am honored that you are taking time to help me.”  Arean turned to him and smiled, shaking his hand like they were old friends, Brenton could see that his charm was natural and not contrived for the women here.  <br>
<br>
“When I got the message from you and saw the opportunity to teach here.”  He smiled to the women assembled with a wink, “I was not about to turn down the chance.  Now where is this young man that needs my help?&quot;  The ladies laughed and Brenton mumbled.  Arean looked around confused.  “Is he not here?” <br>
<br>
Brenton chuckled, “Oh your student is here, but not what you may think.”  He turned and scanned the crowd and saw her standing on a wall trying to see over everyone.  At the age of 15 she was still shorter than most of the women here and almost a foot shorter than Brenton himself.  He motioned to her and she walked forward.  Her weapon and dance training had allowed image of a waterfall to enter one’s mind when she moved, power and grace moving together as one.  <br>
<br>
She moved to the front and brushed back a lock of long platinum hair from in front of her violet eyes.  She offered the monk her hand and a look of amusement crossed her delicate features as his look of confusion crossed his.  She turned to look at Brenton with a wry smile, “I take it you did not mention the gender of your star pupil my teacher?”<br>
<br>
Brenton chuckled and replied, “No, honestly I had not thought of it.  Arean this is my pupil, and now yours, Kestri.”  Arean’s eyes went from him to her and back to him.  He shook her hand then turned to Brenton, “Sir I think we better talk.”<br>
<br>
They walked away from the others, “Brenton are you sure this is wise?  I have tried to teach women before and I seem to not have the skill.  Every woman seems to gain a desire for more than my martial arts and it ruins the teacher pupil relationship.”<br>
<br>
With a glance to his pupil who stood there poised while the ladies around her giggled, “I was worried about that, but I wanted the best.  But somehow now I am less worried than before you arrived.”  He wrapped an arm around the other man’s shoulders and turned him back to the crowd, “But we will see in time.”<br>
