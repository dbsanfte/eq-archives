Poor man is too spared for time to even have nightly drinks with me anymore, but he is far important a man to have any free time. I am Zipparian Badgerbane, a halfling warrior in service to my master, Lord Soulforge, a paladin of Tunare. I shall start from the begining. I first met my master when I was very young. I had made my journey from Rivervale to the human city of Freeport. A large city, but not pleasant like home. I was shocked by the sites of this city. The sites I am afraid to say, were not pleasant ones. An ogre ran his shop freely, smells of gross pickles came from his cart. The Teir'Dal, my people's most hated enemy came and went openly through the gates of this city. I shocked beyond belief. Here I thought the humans were against their dark kind. In my moment of surprise i got careless and pumped into a deeply robed figure. I spun around to see the glowing red eyes flash at me and blue hands reach out and host me by my collar into the air. The voice of this Teir'Dal rang in my ears &quot; Halflings, the most useless of any species. The most that I wish to see die by flames.&quot; The Teir'Dal did not speak to me, he spoke to a human women next to him, she was carrying a great staff, with a human skull at the end of it. She was clothed in extravagant garments, pure silk by the look, but magically altered to give it even more eye appeal. She spoke &quot; My love this little one seems lost, peraphs we should help it.&quot; Her voice was sweet as honey to the ear. I am no fool, I looked into the eyes of this women, They were cold, dead of life, yet cold like with a hunger, hunger for cruelty, pain, things this monster in a womens form would consider fun. The dark robed Teir'Dal smiled a pearly white grin.&quot;Yes, I think we can help it.&quot; Being past my moment of surpise I quickly grabbed this dark elf's arm and kicked with all my might at his hooded head. The kick missed, but surprised him enough to alloy me to struggle free and unsheathe my sword. There I stood, certinaly doomed unless a miracle happened, and in this corrupt city I saw no chance for yelling for yelp. The women laughed evilly, the Teir'Dal moved to the side, and with too swift a move for me to counter pulled fourth a curved dagger from his robe sleeve. The swiftness of the blow and the shear power of my opponent was too great, I new I was doomed. Never being a halfling of belief in any god, I just raised my sword and prepared for the end. I waited, and waited some more....nothing. I opened my eyes, the Teir'Dal was frozen in motion, unmoving. I stared at him with wide eyes. Thinking maybe this to be a cruel trick. Then a voice rang out &quot; Move quickly!&quot; I did so quickly as my halfling speed aloud, which is saying quite a bit for halflings. Seconds after I had moved aside the blade of the Teir'Dal came down in full stroke. He looked to the spot that I should be lying dead, but looked puzzled at the spot I was not at, then over to where I was. Anger filled his eyes, a spell began on his lips. A bright piece of steel suddenly appeared before the Teir'Dals throat. A man extravigantly armored and powerful by his looks held a large sword across the Teir'Dals throat. He was a high elf, a paladin of his race I could tell just by the look of him, said to be the greatest of the Norrathian races. I had never seen such a creature before, I nearly took him for some messenger for the gods. It was not until much later, that I would learn how true this statement was. <br><br>Did in kinda a rush, sorry about that, but will make more time to do better. Stay Safe, lvl well, more coming soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzipparian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zipparian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 5:42:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> War in the commons, journal of a lackey.2</span><hr size=1>  The high elven Paladin flicked his blade upward, making the Teir'Dal's head look up directly into his eyes. The Teir'Dal looked at him with an expression of fear, but one more of deeper hate, for a Teir'Dal to be overcome by a high elf is unbearible torment. My rescuer spoke, &quot; Now vile servant of Innoruuk, I recomend you leave my little friend here alone, and leave this city at once. If I see you again withing these walls again, I will send you to meet your dark god forever.&quot; The Teir'Dal said nothing. My rescuer sheathed his sword and motioned for me to walk over to him. We quickly walked away from the site of the inncident.&quot; You are lucky to be alive my friend. These two I have seen in town much. No good comes from being anywhere near them.&quot; I ran to catch up to my hero. &quot;Excuse me m'lord.&quot; The paladin turned to face me. &quot; I never got your name.&quot; He smiled brightly beconed for me to follow him. &quot; My name is Avethar Soulforge&quot;, I mummered the name a bit to memorize it then replied. &quot; I am Zipparian Badgerbane m'lord, warrior halfling from Rivervale. I have to tell you how gratefull I am that you saved me, I was no doubt no match for those two. And Id like to repay you with a drink at the bar.&quot; The paladin stopped a moment then stared at me for a while. &quot; I would like to have a drink with you my friend, but I am pressed for time, a ship leaves for Butcherblock mountains soon and I must be on it. But if you are so bent on repaying me I would be happy to have you come along with me. I am heading back home to Felwithe.&quot; I could barely believe my luck, here I was almost about to die and now I am going to the High Elf city itself. &quot;Felwithe! I would love to go with you!&quot; That day we prepared for our departcher, packed our bags with food, water, and other items for our needs. Avethar spoke with a small group of greatly armored people, other paladins I guessed, from the looks of them from the Temple of Mar. Mar paladins and other followers are at war with the Militia, this I had heard in Rivervale, but had no idea why until today. They completely opposed what the militia was allowing, and tried desperatly to stop it, but they were loosing slowly. The Militia was too great in numbers and backed by the Teir'Dal and other foul species. Avethar said goodbye to them. We boarded our ship and began our journey through the sea of Tears. Those sites are ones that I will never forget, the huge sea, the sister island with its small inhabitants. While on board a sea giant actually passed by the ship, luckily it was not stupid enough to attack the boat. The boat carried many others, some paladins, mages, a few warriors in the back, and a Rogue, he sat with the warriors, which I noticed that their purses kept on getting smaller and smaller all night. We both slept under the stars that night, on the top deck. We prepared our dinner that night with what we had bought from Freeport. Avethar removed fruits, water, and other items from his backpack. One of excellant quality I could tell. I was very hungry, and unloaded my stuff. Gentle I pulled out my double decker berry stuffed thin crust pie. Then my keg of ale. Avethar stared with mouth open at me. &quot; Im sorry, did you want some&quot;, I passed him a spare keg I had stowed away, not as large as my own, but enough for one. The next day we reached Butcherblock, an odd name I always thought. We never passed the dwarven city, we cut across the wilderness straight to the elven lands. There I felt a wee bit more at home, the trees that were too large to see the tops of reminde me much of outside Rivervale. We came upon a fork in the road we followed from the start of the elven lands. There I almost fell off the hill when I saw the High Elven city. Walls of shining white, towers that rose high up into the air, higher than anything in Rivervale, guards in bright helms standing watchful at the gate. I saw many wonderouse sites as we approached the city. Other high elves came and went out of the gate, a noble couple, both on horseback, rode into the city. Others besides the high elves were around. Woodelves came and went, but not many, most rangers, with bows and quivers at their backs. A pack of druids came up to us. I say a pack because all were in wolf form. They danced happily about Avethar, he picked up a stick and they all went after it. He seeming very pleased to be home conversed with all that came to the gate and kept the pack of druid happy by letting them have steaks he had bought from Freeport. We entere the city, far ahead of him. He showed me the sites of the great city, happy shops, beutiful rose bushes and great buildings for all kinds. That night we stayed at an inn. He had packed away his armor and sold it to a merchant nearby. This I thought was very odd. He had then asked for my sword and minor items to be sold as well. This I was happy to oblige since all were of no use to me now. Accept my food and keg of course. He sat down next to my stool that night. He said in very seriouse, and calmed voice, &quot; Zipp(that being his name for me) tomorrow me and you are going to the city's blacksmith, i have arranged for me and you to be equiped with armor and weapons there.&quot; I smiled happily at this news. But stayed silent, as I new this was not all he had to tell me. &quot; From here you must make a choice, I must now resume where I left off, I am not as strong a paladin as you think my friend. Good enough to be trusted with small errands and letters. But not one as to do any serious work, that is why tomorrow I am to be equiped and resume to advance my skills. You choose what to do after I start this, either part my company and go your own way, for mine will be very hard, or follow me, allow me to train you as best I can.&quot; The room fell silent for a long while, until I came to a decision. I new what I was choosing, the life of a paladin is very differant from that of a warrior. And beging trained by a paladin in warrior ways, I could never hope to be something great, as is most warriors dreams. But I sat there that night, looking at a flickering flame of the candle, and I pondered all the thing in my life that I would miss if I stayed. Nothing came to mind. No family, all dead by Teir'Dal attacks and ambushes. My own small guild would never care that one more warrior has left, expecially one that is so low skilled. True I would be a lackey only, probably until the day I died. Thankfully I am a halfling, and have more logic in these kinda decisions. &quot; Ill follow you then, but on one condition, you pay for all Ale, Pie, and other alcoholic expences.&quot; Avethar keeled over on the floor laughing so hard his sides began to hurt and his face turned red. &quot;What?&quot; I said rather puzzled. <br><br>woota, hope you enjoyed this one, more on the way, please leave replys on what you think, like to hear from everyone. More comming, oh and title doenst make any sense right now, well kinda, but climax is gonna rock. so keap reading <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utienit1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tienit1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/2/02 7:37:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: War in the commons, journal of a lackey.2</span><hr size=1> I hate to post and interrupt your flow - but I must say I really like what you have going here!
