The Paladin takes up the sword.</span><hr size=1> After 11 years of Naval Service I left the military out of disgust and frustration at what I saw as the degradation of our ability to project force abroad and intelligence capabilities 11 months ago.<br>
<br>
I come from a family that has every generation heed the call to military service. I've participated in every conflict this country has been involved in since 1989. I have earned so many medals(including heroism) and ribbons that if I were to where them all I would like a 3rd world dictator and tend to just wear my warfare device and top three.<br>
<br>
Now after my comments on the day of the attack some people sought to brand me a racist because they could not concieve my perception of whats going to be needed to be done in response to this unwarranted and cowardly attack.<br>
<br>
My anger is not directed towards the greater Arab American community but understand that there are still sleepers in this country that need to be rooted out. <br>
<br>
I have had the Honor and Priviledge to serve beside many outstanding Muslim Americans and Muslim nationals of Nations who are our professed friends. I have lived in many countries thats names end in Stan most notably Uzbekistan(sidenote: I came very very close to marrying the oil ministers daughter but thats a story for my memoirs and she was Muslim.) <br>
<br>
I am not a racist my family is probably one of the most diverse in the country. My extended family has Blacks Whites Hispanics Indians and Asians. My immediate family is Dominated by Catholics but my wife is Jewish. My first cousins are Mexican, American, German, Irish, Italian, American Indian and many more. My godson is half Cuban then mix in Italian Mexican and Indian. To accuse me of racism is from my perspective is to accuse a Jew of being a Nazi.<br>
<br>
Now on to the more serious side of my statement.<br>
<br>
Having lived and trained and gathered intelligence and in some cases fought against the peoples who are most likely responsible for this reprehensible act. <br>
<br>
There is only way to fight back against such extremists, and thats to cause such losses that Fear will keep them from ever, even in the shadow of thier minds from planning or trying to carry out such an attack against anyone in the civilized world.<br>
 <br>
Using Terror as a weapon against those while distasteful is in this case the only effective way to cease the enemies will to fight and attack innocent civilians and unfortunately we'll have to learn how to wage such a war as the United States has always sought to aid those around us including those we've conquered.(Germany, Italy and Japan among others.)<br>
<br>
Terror is defined as attacking such targets that would provide comfort to the individuals who would perpetrate such attacks and denying the enemy the ability to gain supply, reinforcement, money, arms and recruits.<br>
<br>
To wage war against those who serve the Jihad we must launch our own equivelant to Jihad and show the enemy our grim resolve to cause them such loss as to pacify them through fear of extinction.<br>
<br>
I do not paint with a broad brush the many millions of peaceful Muslims who shouldn't feel our wrath. I do target those who support Muslim terror groups, such groups as The Base(Bin Ladens bunch) Hammas, the militant arm of the PLO, Islamic Jihad many others and I would dare to include the American Nazi party and the Klu Klux Klan as groups who should also be put out of business and many organizations the world over. <br>
<br>
This is an opportunity to extinguish terror groups the world over lets hope the governments of the world sieze upon this opportunity to clean the worlds proverbial house out.<br>
<br>
Now whether people choose to brand me a racist or not is not something I care about. I tell it straight as someone who has seen the real data of what the reality of the situation is.<br>
<br>
Now some might say real easy for you to say sitting on the sidelines. Before those individuals chime in let me be succint, DUTY HONOR COUNTRY these were words I have lived by for many years and in keeping with my own personal code of ethics I'm awaiting medical clearance to return to full duty which hopefully will come by next Thursday and after that I'm presuming I'll be returning to some of the units I've served with in the past or possibly training those who will be joining our ranks as America calls her young to action. Its my hope I'll be on the pointy end of the stick but I'll be satisfied to serve anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>
I have stood the watch on the wall so that many of you could sleep under the cloak of liberty and freedom and I'm going to do so again. America will never know the security she has previously but sleep well knowing myself and many thousands of others American or Alliance will be on the wall keeping the watch.<br>
<br>
God Bless America, Her Allies and her friends. <br>

<br>
It is clear that you were distraught and outraged.  In the future maybe you will learn to hold on to yoru words until that outrage has straightend itself into the same cohesiveness you display here, and thus will keep you from being called a racist. <p><center>

<br>
I am also a Navy vetran, serverd in the Persian Gulf war.<br>
<br>
I find it pretty ironic that I was at Ground Zero here in New York on Tuesday, and hopefully within a day or two, my brother who is serving aboard the USS Carl Vinson (Nuclear powered air craft carrier) which is on deployment in the Persian Gulf right now, may well be launching an air strike against one of these terrorist organizations that perpetrated these heinius acts.<br>
<br>
I sleep better at night knowing this.<br>
