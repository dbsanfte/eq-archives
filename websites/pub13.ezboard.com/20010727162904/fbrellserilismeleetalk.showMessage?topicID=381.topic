I was wondering if other classes have an opinion on this. There are two main camps in the ranger forums, those that want defense and those that want offense (obviously there are many caveats to each but that is the principle difference). I posted today on what I feel about the class. Lanneth is my only character and I have watched the class I chose change entirely beneath my feet. I went from a tough chain-wearing, dual-wielding outdoorsman to what is basically a rogue that deals less damage, has lower defense and uses spells. I find this to be such a slap in the face. <br>
<br>
here is the post. I welcome all comments, flames, all that.. just keep it on topic please <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Offense Upgrades: Rangers = Casting Rogues!?!?<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been reading all of the commentary on whether Rangers should ask for offense or defense and I find myself consistantly running into the same obsticle. I, and I think many others, initially chose to play a ranger because I had visions of the hardy outdoors-living, dual-wielding, grizzled ranger... the ranger of my old AD&amp;D days. I had visions of Aragorn staring down Black Riders in nought but a chain mail shirt and leather leggings. I chuckled at the thought of Minsc screaming in the face of his foes and charging headlong into battle. I envisioned a hardy fighter, light-weight but still tough. <br>
<br>
What I did not envision was a rogue with spells. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that if we ask for offense upgrades in liu of defense, we are basically giving up the image of a ranger for the Verant-imposed reality that seems to be pushing us more and more in the direction of becoming a &quot;casting rogue&quot;. If we get jolt lowered and our damage upgraded, what have we become? We will simply be rogues with our own &quot;evade&quot; ability, good damage output, and NO tanking ability at all. <br>
<br>
If I had wanted to be a rogue... I would have chosen one at the character selection screen. <br>
<br>
I know that there are many who will take exception to my post. I know that there are many who will say that I do not understand the high-level game. In 52 seasons I have watched my tanking ability vanish to the point where rogues often take damage better than I do. I have watched my &quot;hardy&quot; ranger, my Aragorn, become a wuss. We all know this. What I don't understand is why some people are arguing to let Verant get away with it. We finally have the opportunity to let ourselves be heard and I for one want to see a fight for a return of the &quot;tough&quot; ranger. <br>
<br>
One of the main reasons I chose to play a ranger no longer exists. Rangers in EQ are NOTHING like any ranger I have seen represented in any literature or game EVER!! I did not play a ranger to be a rogue... <br>
<br>
And that, if all we get is offense, is exactly what we will become<br>

If the world were more vast and wild, Rangers would still shine.  If Rangers could actually see tracks on the map and decode them based on knowledge, tracking would actually be a learned skill rather than just a list of what mobs are up in X vicinity.  But EverQuest is a game with a few zones and once everyone knows where to go, who needs a ranger to find anything for them?  Who needs a ranger to lead the way? Honestly I thought it would be neat if the game had sort of a fog like when it's raining, but Rangers could always see further.<br>
<br>
But who needs one as is?  Heck, I could camp the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro without a Ranger.  I just turn my clipping up all the way and use my eyes. There is not a lot of exploration and scouting for a Ranger to do outdoors in EQ, there just isn't enough room.  The same can be said for Rogues in dungeons.  Once we all know where the traps, are the traps threatening anymore?  No.  The only thing they can do to require a rogue is place a locked door in our way.  There is no way an entire party will die if a rogue doesn't detect and disarm a trap in a dungeon.<br>
<br>
It's all poor implementation.  You guys are just variations of the warrior and you are all starting to come a little too close for my comfort.  Give you a higher defense ability and you just become more like a warrior, but you still taunt circles around a warrior.  Then who needs warriors at that point? <p><TABLE width="299">

They are supposed to be the fighters who use a wide selection of weapons, favoring two light swords and a bow. <br>
They are not heavy armor wearing people, and as such you can see why they shouldn't have the ac or defense that a paladin or a warrior might. BUT I would think that Verant should raise the defense SKILLS. Rangers, IMO, should be absolute masters with duel wield, better than warriors (reason later), and should have an insanely high parry skill. They should also have a very very high dodge skill. <br>
The reason why I think rangers should have a higher parry skill and a higher dual wield skill than warriors is because warriors are trained to use ALL weapons, and master each one. They use everything from two daggers to large two handed axes. Rangers pretty much stick with the same set up.. and almost always with two swords. <br>
<br>
A warrior is powerful.. capable of standing toe to toe with any monster, and packin on the metal to stop the blows. A ranger is.. SKILL. Pure skill. <br>
<br>
And what Verant did before, is they goofed up. They admitted to having put too much AC on the Ivy Etched armor, and they put them on the same hp bar as all other hybrids (that was later changed). They did NOT change the ac for ranger's Ivy armor, which resulted in alot of people thinking that rangers are tanks, because, in actuality, they WERE tanks. Rangers could tank as well as a paladin, but once they got past 50, the ranger that Verant wanted pretty much took over. BUT, Verant still fucked up and could not get the class right for the life of them. Rangers have it very hard, they have to keep the aggro on the main tank, yet still do sufficient damage. It's a hard struggle, and I see it all the time. <br>
<br>
What I would like to see done is Rangers to get a much higher skill cap for Parry, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Disarm, Dodge, Offense and Riposte. I'm positive if an increase in these skills would be to take place, the rangers' problem would be pretty much eliminated. <br>
<br>
What most people want, and is not part of the ranger &quot;idea&quot; is for a ranger to become a tank, just like a warrior, but.. rangers aren't tanks. They are bad ass fighters who can shave the hair off a fly with thier swords. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uyshaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yshaa</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/1/01 10:15:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> Ever wonder why rangers get the spell &quot;Glimpse&quot; at lvl 9? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uyshaa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yshaa</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/1/01 10:21:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> Another thing: Rangers should get ultravision, more defensive skills, more BOW skills and a bonus to root and snare, think about it, you snare them, sprint away, and you have the ranger-ogre scene from the EQ intro.<br>

I think rangers are fine. I like grouping with rangers but am embarrassed at how much better they can do my job than I can. I agree with Dantes. Why doesn't Verant just continue to give hybrids increased AC and HP's. Who needs warriors anyway? <br>
<br>
Rangers already outtaunt us and outdamage us. Pally's and SK's are MUCH more versatile while still maintaining reasonable damage and AC. Rogues out damage so much it is frightening, plus hide/sneak etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Any further changes to hybrids and warriors are just a step closer to extinction. You want a ton of hit points, High AC, decent weapon skills, multiple deaths from green mobs while trying to run through a zone and then CR yourself, a life of dependency on other classes just to survive, the total inability to explore a zone solo, then play a warrior. Otherwise, accept the reasonable limitations of your class and lavish in the offsetting benefits<br>
<br>
My thoughts anyway.<br>

They can, and always have been able to, outtank any class. And that is the biggest part of the warrior class - the ability to stand there and take a pounding. They outdamage all hybrids, and survive much longer than rogues. <br>
<br>
Paladins are useful for saving the cleric some mana, as well as putting the taunting out there. Paladins can taunt better than all hybrids, except rangers. <br>
<br>
Rangers are there for the aditional back up utilities, with snares, dd's, dots and buffs. Though the rangers's utility spells are not as in demand as let's say, the paladins' buffs or heals, he/she still puts out enough to be useful. Rangers also deal a fair amount of damage, and can get the mob off a caster/cleric in no time. <br>
<br>
The problem at hand is, once the ranger gets the mob off the cleric/caster, it's very hard to get them off the ranger, because with the current setting, rangers cannot survive very long with an angry mob beating on them. Whereas a paladin can, but it takes a skillful paladin to land the stuns at the right time, and allow himself time to taunt the mob away from the ranger.<br>
<br>
Warriors cannot taunt, I agree. But that is only because warriors cannot cast spells. If rangers could not snare, dd or dot, they would rarely ever have a problem with mob aggro. Warriors have to rely on thier taunt skill and thier damage output.<br>
When I have a warrior in the group, I never taunt. I let the warrior take the hits and let the cleric focus on healing him. I spend my mana on healing the other members of the group. <br>
When and if a mob gets a little crazy and wains off from the warrior, I'm there to stun it and let the warrior regain aggro on it. <br>
<br>
With the right people, a warrior has/should have no problem taunting. If your wizard is overburning, or your ranger is trigger happy with his/her nukes, then yes, you are going to have a nightmare trying to keep the mob on you.<br>
<br>
And with the deaths.. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you know this or not, but warriors die less than any melee class. Bards and Rogues, dish up alot of taunt with thier songs. Especially if the rogue is backstabbing his way to kingdom come and the bard is singing every dd/mez/dot he has memmed. Combined with thier lower ac and hp, they tend to die a bit more frequently than a warrior with 3-4k hp.<br>
Rangers, paladins and sk's don't have quite the survivability problem that rogues and bards do, but they still have to deal with lower ac and lower hp. The paladin has Lay Hands, true, but that is often used to the enchanter or whoever else needs it. Paladins at 55 have Divine Aura, which at that point, increases thier survivability tenfold. But still, they die more than warriors, simply because hybrids don't have the damage output that warriors do, and will not be able to kill the mob in time before they die.<br>
<br>
Warriors are tough, incredibly tough. And if you find yourself dying alot, then change the group's healer with a better one. Warriors simply put, should NOT die in a normal situation. Bad pulls, trains, etc, are not that big of a deal to a warrior, as I've seen it many times firsthand where a warrior runs to the zone barely losing a bubble.<br>
<br>
Often times the only survivors of a bad train are the warrior, paladin and whoever managed to gate out.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I can't see how a warrior can complain. True, they can't solo. But no worse than any other melee. You would think that a paladin could, with the ability to root and back off to heal, and with Lay Hands, but we don't hit enough to kill the high level mobs. <br>
Rangers could try kiting, but won't make it two steps once they step into melee, and they don't have strong enough spells to do sufficient damage before having to close in.<br>
SK's can fear kite, yes.. and they would fare better than the aforementioned classes, but it's going to be a hard battle, as fear can be resisted and will likely turn into an ugly situation fast. Thier spells cost alot of mana, too, and without a high int, a sk is better off grouping.<br>
Bards really are the only melee class that can stand a chance at fighting something - provided they have alot of space to run around in. Thier songs are resisted more than I would like them to be, and they take a LONG time to wear down a mob to where a bard can melee it safely. <br>
Rogues... don't even try it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd say that warriors are pretty well off, and that they don't have alot to complain about. Ya'll chose a warrior to be a bad ass fighter, not a taunter. Well, you got yourself a bad ass fighter, and I doubt you had taunting in mind when you made your warrior. Just remember - a smart group will let you do the taunting and take the hits, and they will help when needed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umcmadbattleseeker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>McMad Battleseeker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/5/01 12:45:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the future of rangers..?</span><hr size=1> Actually Fenye, I agree with most of what you said. Basically you listed the class differences. I think the classes SHOULD be different. Paladins, Shadow Knights, Rangers and Bards all have thier own unique skills and abilities. My benefits to being a warrior is having a ton of hit points and high AC. I just don't think that the hybrids should get those benefits to call thier own, otherwise, why be a warrior?<br>
<br>
Now, I don't have a big complaint about the proposed changes giving Paladins and Shadow Knights higher defensive caps and rangers higher offense caps. I don't think the calsses were terribly unbalanced before this last proposed change, but that is just my opinion. I don't know that they are doing rangers a favor by upping thier offense caps however. This is just going to make my job harder.<br>
<br>
Now, taunting. I rarely have a problem taunting, agreed I have not played the 50+ game yet, but I will soon be there. I do think that if the group plays well together, any warrior should be able to control the mobs 90% of the time. What I mean by this is, if the Ranger is DDing, Dotting, Dual Weilding AND mashing that taunt button he is going to die, nothing I can do about it, I will never get the mob off him. If the casters are nuking/dotting so hard they are constantly drawing aggro, they are probably going to die, nothing I can do about it. However, if the ranger doesn't mash his taunt button, and the caster is able to properly control the hate list, we should have no troubles. Taunting is a matter of timing, smart use of weapons/skills, and each group member properly playing his role.<br>
<br>
Now on deaths, while in a group, yes warriors can usually outlast just about anyone and rarely die unless it is a total party wipe out. Now, getting to the place where the group will be hunting is another story.../smirk.<br>
<br>
My main point is this. All classes have their own strengths and weaknesses. Hybrids are a utility class that have the ability to do many different things albeit none of those things as good as thier parent class. Now, my purpose, my ONLY purpose as a warrior, is to be the best at taking a beating and keeping a mob on me while doing a reasonable amount of damage, give hybrids these two things and you don't need me.<br>

I am not complaining about being a warrior. I am just saying our life isn't all sunshine and lollipops, even when compared to yours. We all have our strengths, and we all have our weaknesses, I would like to see it stay like that.  <p><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/asaintone/Image6.jpg>

I thik they should have boosted a rangers defense to..say equal to Paladins or SK's, or even give them defensive skills. I know some rangers were fighting for a boost in offense, but to be honest there is not really a HUGE difference in how much damage I do and how much damage a ranger does holding the same weapons (melee only I mean, spells being discounted).<br>
<br>
Right now a rangers defense skill caps at the same as a druid's. That just isn't right, not that I think it should be the same as a warrior, but a DRUID?  <p><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/asaintone/Image6.jpg>

<br>
Shadow Knights and Paladins have the same defensive caps as Warriors. True.<br>
<br>
Rangers have the same offensive caps as Warriors. True.<br>
<br>
Warriors, as you see, have the best of both worlds, skill wise. They have higher offensive caps than paladins and sk's, and higher defensive caps than rangers.<br>
<br>
Rangers do NOT have the same defensive caps as druids. Lol, they most certainly do not.<br>
<br>
Now, on another note, Warriors are not being any less desirable than they were before. Before, all hybrids were not wanted in groups because of our manasponge-ness. We wiff too much and we get hit too much. <br>
<br>
This new patch is bringing us closer to what we should be originally. Paladins (as well as shadowknights) have always been the thesis of a warrior embued with the divine strength of thier diety. They are essentially, Warriors with a Cause. They wear the heavy armor, wield the heavy weapons, and cast powerful magic. <br>
Warriors on the other hand, are more of a Beserker it seems like. When EQ warriors get low on health, they go into a beserk stage, raising str and damage output. In all the fantasy novels I've read, Beserkers are essentially fighters with a hidden power of beserker rage. <br>
I know, that in a game wear thousands of people play, thier idea of a warrior, a ranger, or whatnot is going to be different than what the game designer had in mind. I mean, look at the bard. In every game I've played, from Baldur's Gate to Palladium, bards are not these platemail wearing, dual wielding, master song weavers. Bards have been.. moral support. lol.<br>
<br>
Ok, on with my point.<br>
<br>
Paladins are a defensive class. Bar none. They are there to put themselves up in front of others and take the hits, and allow the others to fight while they do what they can to protect the group with heals, stuns, and thier tanking ability.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knights are also a defensive class. They pack on the armor and use thier magic, thier pets, and thier adequate swordsmanship ability to take down thier foe.<br>
<br>
Rangers are an offensive class. Thus they have the massive boost of skills (though, they SHOULD have higher dodge, parry, riposte) and speed to cut down thier enemy. The use of DD's and DOT's help them kill thier foe before they themselves are too hurt to continue fighting. Snare prevents the enemy from escaping (or chasing after them, hehe).<br>
<br>
Warriors are the best of the three. They have the defensive skills of the paladin/sk, and the offensive skills of the ranger. There just is no comparison between them all, because warriors never lost anything to begin with. Verant just made the hybrids what they were supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Granted, in the pre50 game, this is barely noticable. But once you get past 50, warriors were unrivaled. Paladins, SK's and Rangers just couldn't do enough damage to mobs and take the hits. Clerics were severely taxed on mana, and this is why you get the standard post50 group (Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Druid/Wizard, Monk/Rogue/Shaman, one other). There is no room for hybrids, because the mobs in the post50 game were too strong. I know this, being a 55 paladin, it's hard to tank a mob for me. With the increase in skill, I will eventually build up the AC to withstand the mobs as well as the warriors can, although I will still get hit a tad more, being my armor is a bit less AC and I don't have as high as dodge skills.<br>
<br>
Finding groups as a hybrid were a bitch. Warriors will still be preferred over us hybrids, and the only thing I can think of that will make someone choose a hybrid over a warrior is the level of the two. But at least now, people will want to have us hybrids. The new spells we get is just additional icing on the cake to let people want us. I mean, would YOU want me in your group? I can heal 250hp to every group member in a group heal that takes 1.5 seconds to cast. I can give 100hp buffs that stack with all other buffs. I can heal very well (185wis and over 2000total mana). I have alot to offer groups, and now I'll have even more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think you should clarify that.  If by that you mean all defensive skills, yes, a ranger has dodge capped higher than druid,  and druids most certainly don't get Parry skill.  But DEFENSE skill is capped at the same number as druid.   <br>
<br>
If you think they aren't, you are wrong.  my ranger has 200 defense, my druid has 200 defense.  200 is the ranger defense cap, and it's the druid defense cap too.<br>

Any ranger that has made it past 50 knows how to manage aggro. With a warrior in my group I can sit back, whack at the mob's rear, snare when I need to, root if he gets stuck on me, and back off so he re-aggros on the warrior. <br>
<br>
The real problem is that there was a time when I was a viable tank.... and I miss that. <br>
<br>
I played a ranger because I wanted to be a light agile fighter BUT I didn't want to be a rogue.. I wanted to take some damage... be able to heroicly stand up to creatures and give and receive blows. That vision, which lasted me through lvl 50 and all over the original continents, vanished with the release of Kunark. <br>
<br>
I now have less tanking ability than most rogues. They have significantly higher defense caps than I do and their armor is comprable to mine. For all of those defensive advantages, rogues still outdamage me significantly. <br>
<br>
Rangers will never tank as well as warriors... not even close. BUT we should tank better than rogues, monks or even Shamen... and currently we don't. The real problem is that there suddenly is NO place for a ranger in a well balanced group. A planned raid would never choose a ranger over a rogue for damage (despite the fact that we are the &quot;damage dealing&quot; hybrid)nor would a raid ever take a ranger over a warrior... or a druid (our other parent class). <br>
<br>
In the high level game of specialization, there is no room for rangers. The game has changed significantly from the time when I could tank Bok Knights in Guk and Fire Giants in Sol if I had to. Not only has the game changed but so has my class. Where once my defense caps were close to those of warriors, they have barely changed at all since then in the face of huge upgrades in other classes. It just seems a little like when Verant was planning the expansions rangers fell through the cracks. <br>
<br>
Threaten warriors?? I wish...  <br>

Honestly. I group with Tanari a whole lot, and unless we are grouped with a super rogue (like Kierra or some of the other uber rogues) she tanks far better than the rogue. Tanari is 55, full Thorny Vine armor, with an ac of around 900 (with UberFenye buffs :P ) She can't tank as well as I can, but she can certainly hold her own for a little while, and certainly much longer than a rogue, and a little longer than a monk. Shamans are a plate class, and plate armor, even if it has the same AC as a chain armor, will absorb more damage than chain. Which, all ranger armor is considered. So yes, a shaman could possibly tank better than a ranger, provided he/she has high enough ac. <br>
<br>
But don't get so down on yourself hon, Rangers are a good class, and I used to be VERY hard on rangers. I even hated grouping with them because I hated them so much. But when I finally pulled my head out of my ass and looked at the class, and figured out what could be done to help Tanari survive longer rather than bitch at her all the time, I had a total change of perspective. That hatred for rangers turned to respect really fast, because I view rangers as a perfect pair to a tank. Rangers have enough abilities to handle alot of situations, they just need a buddy to shoulder some of the damage with them. <br>

I for one would love to be able to *see* the track I'm following.  That would be so interesting.  Also, to be able to see *better*.  Infravision would be lovely!  Glimpse??  I've used it a few times, and it's a neat little trick, but can anyone say it's handy??<br>
<br>
re:  the warrior/ranger taunt issue.....I frequently group with my warrior/husband, and we've become a neat little team.  He pulls (so it aggros on him), I snare/dot/whatever, so it's taunted on me for a bit, but then he starts taunting, and it goes back on him, and I can do some damage, and still have the mana to heal him.  It's a good system, the warrior/ranger duo.  If you're careful.  He's 45, I'm 41.  Is this warrior taunting problem a higher level thing??  Coz I haven't really seen it, yet.<br>

My ranger can tank practically anything in antonica, FG's and Imps in sol b still hurt, stuff in hole that's 50+ hurts, and vox and naggy hurt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anything else i can tank pretty well, was able to solo even con greater kobolds in sol b for gods sake, at 35.<br>
<br>
In kunark, mobs are all hitting much harder, and at the 50+ game the rangers weapons tend to be low dly. combine that with the spells that rangers are called upon to cast, such as snare, and you get agro a warrior sometimes can't get off,  or by the time they get it off, the ranger has taken a couple of sup heals, which is usin up cleric mana that ideally shouldn't be used up.<br>
<br>
revultant whip, dly 14<br>
snare<br>
<br>
great agro combo due to dly and high taunt factor.<br>
<br>
warriors have taunt and their blades.  often isn't enough to keep the taunt soon as the ranger snares.   <br>
<br>
Myself, when i group with my ranger in tough places i don't engage a mob immediately, i have to wait a few to let the tank get that agro before i jump in,  and i don't even try to snare till mob is at half.  and a lot of the time i get hit some right after i land that snare...<br>
<br>
That's why warrior taunt needs to be better, that or have a item they can get that lets em click it and it does nice taunt factor to mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So, is the solution to make the warrior stronger?  But, didn't they just buff us rangers up a bit closer to warrior status?  So that's not going to happen.  Maybe give warriors better taunt-ability.<br>
