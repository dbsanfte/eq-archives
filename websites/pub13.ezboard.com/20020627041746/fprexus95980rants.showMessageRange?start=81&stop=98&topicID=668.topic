Also, most people ended up commenting on guild clerics which is a real no-brainer in my mind. Of course you reimburse your guild clerics/chanters/mages. If you didn't, you would have no guild clerics/chanters/mages. No matter how nice a person is, they can't bleed that kind of plat every other night for any length of time.<br>
<br>
Anyone saying that clerics are greedy for keeping too much in pp rich camps should ask himself this:<br>
<br>
When was the last time you were in a non-pp camp, even noticed or cared how much the cleric was spending, then ponied up your share of pp for costs?<br>
<br>
If you're gonna bitch on the one hand, it's only fair that you bitch on the other hand. By number, the camps where clerics come out ahead are far fewer than those where they take a loss.<br>
<br>
No, it's not your responsibility to pay for a clerics raids/groups where they are shanked. It's your responsibility not to shank clerics during your raids/groups. Do clerics sometimes take more than expenses -- yes. Do you freeload off clerics in camps where no pp loot drops -- of course you do. It's naive to think otherwise.<br>
<br>
BTW, 700pp... lvl 60. Man, that necro loot is really paying off. Perhaps in 10 years I can buy a frostbringer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukattriaminx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kattria Minx </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 3:13:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=82>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: loot lalala</span><hr size=1> I think some people posted that their guild compensated ALL clerics, at the least, on raids.

It's just as much the responsibility of the cleric, guest or no, to ask for some sort of reimbursement on raids if they are using dots and the hosting guild didn't hand them reagents at the start. Enchanters too, if they are expected to rune. <br>
<br>
To those of you clerics, of which there are MANY, who are fair with the splits, even with the pp items and gems, you rock.

<br>
I do understand how expensive dots are.  If I am primary crowd controller on a raid I can easily go through half a stack runing myself alone.  If fighting a lifetapping or 'uber' mob I can chew through up to half a stack in a single fight.  However, I have never received (or asked for) special treatment from my xp/loot groups because of that.  <br>
<br>
If the hosting guild won't cover your costs, don't raid with them.  If it's your own guild, either hit the guild bank or find another guild that has a more responsible approach to reimbursement (hint: Sword of Fate is one of those <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Do not expect a pickup group to pay the costs of others' failures to compensate you.<br>
<br>
Please note that I am not calling YOU a 'greedy cleric' or any other such nonsense.  I am simply saying that clerics' LEGITIMATE concerns about compensation should not be satisfied by claiming the majority of the cash drops in an xp/loot group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukattriaminx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kattria Minx </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/16/01 5:17:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=84>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Master Loot(hogs) are pissing me off...</span><hr size=1> Darn it, I forgot to add something. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It was another hope of mine in posting that question about compensation that guilds that currently DON'T compensate for reagents on raids or have a system for spells and gems, realize that other, successful, guilds do, and that they should start too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujezebellconcordia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jezebell Concordia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/17/01 5:41:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Master Loot(hogs) are pissing me off...</span><hr size=1> I'm saying that the whole compensation thing is bigger than just a group in (ie.

If anyone should help out the greater good, maybe it should come from the guilds more often rather than groups. Food for thought.

Why in the world should it be a clerics responsibility to &quot;ask&quot; for compensation on a raid? That is just crazy. The reality that I will use peridots on a raid is the same reality that I will wake up and go to work in the morning. I can't remember a single raid I've been to ever where I didn't use peridots. Wouldn't it be a lot easier if the person in charge of compensating clerics went down the list of clerics at the end of a raid? After all, isn't that their job -- to make sure the clerics get paid? I'll say that a lot of the time I don't even know who the person is who is supposed to be doing this job. When I do: &quot;/who all person-paying-clerics&quot; nothing ever comes up.<br>

<br>
And these guilds might SAY that they compensate clerics on the forums, but do they actually practice what they preach?  The mentality usually is that the "pp loot" goes to the guild bank, that way the guild clerics can use it when they need to or the gems can be used to make jewelry for the guild, what people say and what people actually do in the game can be completely different.  Anyway, my point is, when you are grouped with a cleric in Sebilis and it seems like alot of pp items are dropping, try to keep in mind that that money goes to pay for the symbols you ask for every hour on the raids  ;P <p><P>

<br>
However, if I were leading a raid and a cleric asked to come, super, but I'd expect them to keep me posted on what the expended. If they can't be bothered to do that, I can't be bothered to compensate them.<br>
<br>
It really is up to both sides. Raids should compensate, and if they don't, the cleric needs to step up and say something. I'm just curious why this seems to be the strongest argument for letting clerics ML in groups, when if the problem of clerics going broke is because of raids, then why not put your foot down and say so during the raid that's breaking your bank? You don't symbol me in a group, yet I have to suck it up for the greater good? What if I'm an independent too? What if my guild is too small to support this greater good? If I'm an independent, I need that money too, as I'm not able to acquire gear as easily as those in raid-capable guilds.<br>
<br>
Why should random pick up group pay for your unwillingness to stick up for yourself and get reimbursed on raids? Is it that you care less what the people in random pick up group think of you than what the people on the raids you go on think of you? After all, pick up groups random the loot, raiding guilds don't. If that's not the reason why you can't politely request compensation, then what is it?<br>
<br>
Be honest. In what situations do you spend the most on dots? That's where you should be looking to get something back, not grouping with Peter on Friday so you can symbol Paul's raid on Saturday.<br>
<br>
I don't want you guys getting ripped off, but darn it, I don't want to fund your dots because you can't ask for reimbursement. I'm the one who ends up being ripped off. <br>
<br>
And you know what, I don't get to keep the money drops on raids either.<br>

<br>
This is not good, but I bet a lot of people feel the same way you do. Why should a cleric who wants to go on a specific raid have to pay his way? A rogue or a monk or pretty much any other class wouldn't have to.<br>
<br>
You say that a cleric shouldn't try to compensate for raids by overlooting in xp groups. Should a cleric try to compensate for non-pp-having xp groups in other xp groups? In other words, should a cleric ever take more than what he used in an xp group? Or should he only take enough and in most cases not enough? It is this line of thought that keeps most clerics poor. Gem drops are very uneven, it's not viable to say that a cleric shouldn't try to compensate between zones to break even.

<br>
More entitled? No. More likely to be on my mind if I'm the one who invited the cleric. If I didn't hand you a stack of dots at the beginning of the raid, what's wrong with asking how your dots will be handled? Why can't you take control of your own role and what it costs? It goes both ways. I'm all for cleric compensation (providing they don't bail after, surprise, the cleric drops are done), but I admit, it's not the only thing I think about on a raid, or would be thinking about if I was leading the raid. But if I forget to pay you on a raid I led, does that mean it's OK to screw that wizard who never got a symbol from you, who also didn't get paid for reagents he used in TLing the same raid you were on when it was over?<br>

What makes the cleric any different than anyone else? We all go to the phat lewt zones when the bank gets a little light, we go to other zones when we don't need the money. That plat the cleric takes for symbol could go to my better gear fund, which, oddly, *also* helps me take more damage. that plat the cleric takes for symbol could go to the wizard who TLs people. To buy pearls for Mage CoH, for druids to stop the rain, for necros to buy coffins, for enchanters to cast rune, to buy more mana items, more HP items, more AC items, faster delay weapons so the mobs die faster hence they do less damage for you to mend, buy higher damage spells, buy better buff spells to complement cleric buffs. Do you take THOSE costs into consideration when divvying up the fair share over time? What makes the cleric more entitled to get these considerations over others?<br>
<br>
WE ALL NEED MONEY to make the group as efficient as possible. To those ML'ers who only take the current group into consideration when splitting the take, thank you. Because of you, I can finally afford my second tink bag!<br>

<br>
Then by the same token, in camps that aren't rich in pp loot the ENTIRE group needs to port to bank at the end to get the cleric the plat that he used. In my estimation, about 75 percent of xp camps in the game would fall under this category. With the courage to speak up for myself that you've shown me I need, I'm sure none of the group members will have a problem doing this. Or rather, I might be considered an @#%$... much as I might be considered an @#%$ for asking for reimbursement from a guild that did not intend to offer.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if that sounds condescending, but you really seem to have over-idealized the issue. It cannot be as cut and dried as taking out cost and dividing the rest evenly in every camp. Every camp does not support this. The reason I have largely been using raids as examples are because they are large-scale examples of what happens on a nightly basis in most xp camps. In most xp camps, you come out a little short. On some raids, you come out very short. It is truely a cleric's fate to be nickle-and-dimed to death over the course of time. You can't expect your idealized looting method to happen in a high-pp camp if you do not deal with the low-pp (I said 75 percent, correct me if you think I'm wrong) camps. I would include raids as, potentially, the lowest-pp of all camps.<br>
<br>
And you never answered my question: Should a cleric ever take more than he used from an xp group? If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then you're asking me to create plat in the 75 percent (again, that's my number and it's really not important what that number is, so long as it's more than zero) of camps where I'm not going to break even. I'm flipping thru my spell book and I'm not seeing a summon plat spell... they must sell it in the Erudin library or somewhere I haven't looked. And we'll just chalk any raid I take a bath on as a several-hundred-plat installment toward my education on who not to raid with... Now THAT is some Ivy League schooling.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'd like to offer you your own advice. If you feel you're not getting what you deserve in any camp, demand your share as you'd have a cleric demand his recompense on a raid. No one should think any less of you for doing so, right? If the ML doesn't give you what you consider fair, consider it a learning experience about who not to group with. It's not a high-priced education like the one I seem destined for, but it's an education nonetheless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukattriaminx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kattria Minx </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/18/01 2:27:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=94>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Master Loot(hogs) are pissing me off...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then by the same token, in camps that aren't rich in pp loot the ENTIRE group needs to port to bank at the end to get the cleric the plat that he used. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why? We all spend plat to play the game. Food, drink, equipment, spells, luxuries (ports, rezes). Do you give other players that use reagents their fair share of what they've used? When we need money, we go to the plat/phat lewt zones.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Should a cleric ever take more than he used from an xp group?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I used to be OK with that. I am OK with that if it isn't excessive. But I don't like me paying your price for when you play in plat-scarce zones or can't remind raid leaders about dot usage. Remember that I came here too to make some money. I like the idea of splitting every 7-8 money items. That seems fair. The cleric keeps 2/7-3/8 the money loot, sacrificing some if there's an enchanter in the group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then you're asking me to create plat in the 75 percent <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Uh, no I'm not. Common practice in the pickup groups I've been in is that we ask the ML to give the cleric and enchanter the money to make up for dots they used, then we split the rest of the money items. You didn't need to create plat, you made plat in addition to recovering your plat costs for that night. That 2/7 you made in Seb covers the 2/7 you made in plat-scarce zones that didn't meet your dot usage costs.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, there's exp nights when <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> makes any money, and many times, we lose money. Not enough to recover costs of food, drink, and port costs, or sometimes sadly the coffin costs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Finally, I'd like to offer you your own advice. If you feel you're not getting what you deserve in any camp, demand your share as you'd have a cleric demand his recompense on a raid. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I already got sick of this a long time ago. I spend most of my time grouping with guildies, where I don't mind if the cleric MLs because they always symbol me on raids when I ask. The rest of the time, if it's a serious camp like in HS, the druid usually MLs, or if mana calls are too low, we just tell them to med and the melees will loot. If it's casual grouping, like just me and a few others, we all loot just to clear the mobs. If I loot more than anyone else, I split it all evenly and I give gems to the cleric and enchanter. Usually a 2:1 ratio. <br>
<br>
Some camps you recover your costs, some camps you recover your costs plus some, some camps you don't recover your costs. It's this way for everyone, not just clerics.<br>

<br>
1)  If your not getting repaid your expenses on raids, then don't raid with those people.  In the entire time I played my mage not once did a guild deny me compensation of my Pearl costs (Call of the Hero).  Not once have I seen a cleric not get reimbursed either.  If your not getting paid back, then it is your own fault for raiding with those people.<br>
<br>
2)  As a mage I hardly ever got any buffs besides perhaps a Group buff.  As my monk it is the same for the most part excepting shaman buffs when I'm lucky enough to be grouped with one.  Why should I have to pay for you to restock when I'm not even seeing you spend that money you are supposedly spending hand and foot?<br>
<br>
3)  Here is the kicker.  I know a twink (with equipment as good as my own) who was totally financed off of Seb groups...  Not off of loot rolls, but off of plat items...<br>
<br>
4)  It isn't my job in a group to remind the cleric to not be a greedy pos and to share the wealth.<br>
<br>
I agree with regent casters getting repaid for expenses in groups.  I don't agree though with the idea that groups should be repaying you because you *lost* money in a zone that doesn't have many plat drops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzeistprexus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zeist prexus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/18/01 4:52:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Freeloaders suck</span><hr size=1> What makes clerics any different from other classes? We use more plat than any other class, hands down. In that regard, we also lose more plat than any other class. No contest.<br>
<br>
We have most of the other costs you mentioned. Peridots are a cost above and beyond that. Last I checked, I had the same number of equipment slots as anyone else. I have the same need for TLs/ports. I have the same need for spells (cleric spells being some of the most expensive, if you can even find anyone selling them). If a wizard is out of TL fragments or the mage is out of pearls, well it might suck a little in an xp group. If the cleric is out of peridots, that's a huge problem. To compare a stack of TL fragments or a couple stacks of food and water to several stacks of peridots makes no sense.<br>
<br>
What we need to be clear on is what proportion of xp camps are &quot;break even&quot;. This is important, as it should be a direct reflection of what proportion of plat loot the cleric needs to take from camps that are over the &quot;break even&quot; point. I believe, using your 2/7 to 3/8 split all clerics would have to spend an impossible amount of time in sebilis, necro specifically. It would be impossible due to the sheer number of clerics and the tiny number of camps that net surplus plat.<br>
<br>
The majority of xp camps in the game cannot support symbol costs. I used VL as an example because it is on the opposite end of the spectrum from necro. If you're coming away from HS groups with pp or pp items, you should probably thank your cleric. I would count every camp I've been in in HS as below the &quot;break even&quot; point. Therefore, the plat or items your getting in HS may as well come directly from the cleric's bank.<br>
<br>
Every single person reading this has, at some time or another, grouped with a cleric who took a loss during a group. A bold statement to be sure, but one I'm certain is true. This is why clerics take more than expenses when they can and this is why it is fair. I'm not stealing from Peter to pay Paul. Peter and Paul may as well be the same person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzeistprexus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zeist prexus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(11/18/01 5:04:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=668.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Freeloaders suck</span><hr size=1> Chabisu:<br>
