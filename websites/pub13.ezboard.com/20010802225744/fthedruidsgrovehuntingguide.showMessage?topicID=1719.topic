Things he/she is not: a griffon; married or related to a griffon; carrying a Back inventory item; dearly loved by druids. He/She is a Pegasus, calling it a horse with wings is like calling Naggy a basilisk grown up. <br>
I'll be the first to tell you that I have never killed, nor seen this rare in South Karana, so this post will help you and me if we all work on solving the puzzle. I have seen the Pegasus Feather Cloak however, and I dream of it every time I port to DL. So, let us start with what pieces I've collected, add in what pieces others can, then come up with something all of us can benefit from. <br>
<br>
Random Spawn--this i cannot agree with. In all my experience in the game, something leads to something else which results in a third development. Just look at the quests... *****SPOILER: Gnoll brewers spawn more often if you START the quest by talking to the guy in Sure Fall Glades about &quot;exterminating the gnolls&quot; or something. Do that and BOOM, the gnoll brewer spawns in BB. It even used to work with the Paw of Oppola and talking to Vin Moltar. END OF SPOILER.***** It's the same as having a PH for a rare. Kill the PH, and then the rare &lt;may&gt; come, the rare doesn't just spontaneously pop in, normally. I also don't believe this creature has a &quot;random&quot; spawn point, as some have mentioned the many problems an untraceable bug (due to being random) may cause. So, Quillmane may have several spawn points, but not random. <br>
Spawn Table--this sounds more reasonable to me. If ever you tried to kill Mr. Underbrush in LFay, you know he's tricky. The &quot;trick&quot; however is in the Tables... killing enough creatures on one spawn table causes another spawn table (the rare table in the case of LFay) to start its cycle. Several off the second spawn table spawn directly after each other till the specified number/time is reached. Then back to Table 1. It works in Frontier Mountains and Trak's Teeth the same way. That's why IMEDIATELY after forager/hunter dies, another pops, or a rare. That's why in my travels of Lfay, i could kill a string of Thistle,Thistle, that named spider(Queen Nathaoidulejljfd), the named bee(Crookstinger?), Thistle right in a row. Soon as one is dead (or close to it) another spawns in the zone. Frontier Mounts have a couple rare tables, and a few spawn points for those rares to pop, just check out the posts on FM.<br>
<br>
Ok, so there's a spawn table. WHAT is on that spawn table, and HOW do we get it to start SPAWNING? In Lfay, there's common creatures (of a certain type) that need to die to start the rare cycle. I kill about 14 of the certain type (slips my mind at this time, but it's at the tower--not the jongleurs, but that kind of creature). After they die, i start looking for a rare. In TT, foragers/hunters are on the rare table, so one table to work with. FM, several tables, but if you kill some on table 1, it moves to table 2. <br>
HYPOTHETICALLY, all the rares in SK could be on that one table. I haven't heard of two rares in SK being up at the same time--not that I've heard of even 1 being up long enough to check. I HAVE heard of someone killing Quillmane only to realize Quill has respawned (meaning maybe one table for the rares, or only a few on Quill's table).<br>
The question is then, HOW? Well, it's not Aviaks that cause the rares to come, they are almost always camped on my server. Maybe they could be the wandering Aviaks, but probably not, as trackers fed up with the village pick them off as well. I'm thinking something not too much killed, a greenie to most in the zone... like in Lfay, the 14 greenies I kill to get Thistle to spawn...<br>
I cannot remember the poster, but i saw someone say killing elephants and escaped paw gnolls might cause Quillmane to spawn. These are a start. <br>
<br>
So, now, WHERE? Well, the gnolls are near Split Paw, quite centrally located, if you look at a good map. If you pull one off EQmaps, you should see this easily. Elephants... no clue. What type? your guess is as good as mine. Quillmane himself several times is said to have spawned in the western part of the zone, north of paw, as well as near the shadowed men. Looking at the map, this makes sense. Sightings I've heard of are at Shadowed men, Paw, Aviak village, Lake Rathe zone, near the hermit, and Treants. Tracing out the pathing sounds like a curvy &quot;U&quot; to me. I would doubt the Casters at the Treants would let Quill pass by them, and I have only heard of a few sightings there. More sightings at the village and paw, nearer to the beginning of Quill's route. Then again, maybe Quill cons red to the Treant casters, and they leave him well alone. <br>
<br>
What we need is more Information and Experimentation. I sincerely believe in the Spawn Table idea. I don't know what causes the rares to start spawning or where they do spawn, but information on the sighting and pathing of other rares would be very helpful. Any input is welcome, especially, if you come up with actual locs of the pathing. If you do come across the rare spawn, please follow it if you can, /loc'ing all the way. In addition, if you do spot a rare, don't forget to keep tracking after it has died, as there may be another rare coming up. Your information will help us all solve the mystery, please don't be shy with what you have learned. <br>
<br>
If something I have mentioned here is false, please feel free to refute it. I'm certainly not perfect, and clarification will help us all. <br>

lemme tell ya from my xperience in SK, while hunting outside the spires, i saw quillmane 6 times in 1 week, one time tried to solo her and got the royal smacketh-down (was only 26, but wtf right?*grins*) the second 4th time i saw her, i had her all alone again, this time at 29th, she was yellow to me and i got KSed by a freaking ice cometing mofo, holy hells bells i was PISSED! no cloak dropped tho so i was ok after that.heh. anyways, all 6 times i saw her she flew right by spiltpaw, if i was at spire 2 facing it, she was about 100 ft behind me, just flying away. so i think she has a static path that she follows. hmph. im gonna get her....<br>

<br>
Well, on my first half-day of checking on Quilmane, none turned up, and it seems the Escaped Split paw gnolls cause the shamans (Ren'Rex, etc) to pop. Those are new anyway. I'm thinking that the ph would have to be either some of the low greenies that are spread out over the entire region (lions, shadow wolves, mist wolves, elephants) or a &quot;a wolf&quot; like &quot;a drake&quot; in Rathe. But i think that latter would be hard to find considering an elephant and a lion/lioness are common. Still, there are the static Skeles and Zombies at the ruins/wiz port. <br>

<br>
Horses have manes too, though. :) It's a good idea though. <br>
<br>
I found a large number of Elephant Calves near Paw, and the surrounding areas. Low numbers of lions and mistwolves/shadowwolves. Currently, I'm focusing on what spawns between Paw and the Shadowed Men, but if someone would like to hit the area between Aviak Village and Shadowed Men, it'd be helpful. Until then, back to work.<br>

Since we're druids here, it's easier to use a pet then nuke or even melee everything in sight. WHut I do is whip out one of those lower level Pet spells (lower the better=less mana, I know befriend works I'll see how low ya can go though :) ). Go try to find a bull just because they are higher lvl, but just a plain elephant works fine. Buff him a little, use that pet buff spell that you forgot about etc...sow.

I believe that since Quillmane is a horse-type, then perhaps killing centaurs triggers her?<br>
<br>
Observation #1<br>
I have seen and killed Gnashmaw several times, and he always seems to spawn in the hills by the Hermit area.<br>
<br>
Observation #2<br>
I have killed Shaman Phido, kept tracking, and almost immediately another Phido popped.<br>
<br>
Observation #3<br>
After I kill the Werewolf, Sentry Alechin pops almost right after.<br>
<br>
Rumors and scuttlebutt:<br>
I have been in the zone and noted that right after someone bragged about killing Krak Windchaser, others started shouting that Quillmane was up. This has also happened when Grizzleknot popped once. Maybe its a vendor slaughter thing? Invariably someone always wants to kill Krak, why I have no idea, but they do just the same. Perhaps this is the spawn trigger?<br>
<br>
Things we can rule out:<br>
I say we can rule out the slaughter of Tesh Mas Gnolls, aviaks, centaurs, treants, elephants, lions, wolves, cyclops, and shadowed men. These are common prey and die daily for our xp gain.<br>
<br>
Mobs to suspect:<br>
Escaped gnolls, Shaman rares, Undead Cyclops (maybe), vendors, named centaurs, and probably anything else from the rares table. It is logical to assume that any rare spawn would be triggered by killing another rare spawn. A thousand times I have run past shaman ren Rex and his ilk just to go kill something else. Perhaps if we all concentrated on smoking these greenies, then we may discover their true worth? Just my thoughts.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps. At least we have a few more things to add to the equation. <p><i><b>Wyndwyllow Whysper<br>

Escaped Splitpaw gnolls, Lions, Elephants, Wolves, Avaiks (there a lot of wandering avaiks) Maybe Tesch Mal Gnoll runners? (if Quill truly spawned at Paw entrance, not warped)<br>
<br>
I agree that being able to map her path would be helpful, but good luck with that.  But if we can get a few bits and pieces, extrapolation could be possible.  Dunno.<br>
<br>
Good luck<br>

From these you can either get the generic Escaped Splitpaw Gnoll, Roaming Aviak, Roaming Centaur, or the less generic Roaming Treant or Cyclops.<br>
<br>
The next tier is the Paladin Quest critters, the Monk Quest guy, the three Wandering Shaman and the two Wandering Druids.<br>
<br>
The final tier is the no more than once a day spawns. Grizz, Groi, Quill.<br>
<br>
These do not seem to in any way overlap the spawns at the undead ruins.<br>
<br>
Each of these spawn areas is near a camped site: Between Centaurs and Treants, Between Monk and Aviaks, Between Aviaks and Paw, Between Paw and Undead.<br>
<br>
Best way to keep the tables moving is to kill all the roaming mobs.  Best way to catch the rares is to either have a ranger track from the middle (a tad south of the well where Vhalen dies), or have a team in each corner (or two teams with a bard or a druid tracker).<br>
<br>
So far, I've managed to see everyone BUT Groi Gutblade...so he may very well be part of something else that needs triggering, but the rest all just seem to pop whenever a space is open and the inner workings of the game make a lucky coin toss.<br>

I had pretty much spent much of 17 levels in SK.<br>
<br>
Killing Aviaks, and Gnolls.<br>
<br>
I have rolled on 2 leggings, don't even know what the stats are.<br>
<br>
Been in 2 other FFA's for her.<br>
<br>
I was there at level 35, quadding gnolls for the scrolls, great quest by the way.<br>
<br>
Had just ensnared 2 of them, when what do I see just north of the Paw hill, but white flapping wings.  Quick con, and run for it, leaving the gnolls behind.  Root, blast, blast, blast.  What a rush.<br>
<br>
Goodbye Batwings, ha.<br>
<br>
It is heavy and is a shoulder slot item, not back, as it's image denotes.<br>
<br>
All your conjecture of spawning and pathing is all well and good, but Quill is no Hasten Bootstrutter.  Slowest roaming NPC I have ever encountered, virtually stationary.  For Quill to actually survive for anytime at all, wandering on a path seem kind of silly to me.  Everytime I have seen her, she has been in a different spot, and I will bet you that it was virtually inches from where she spawned.<br>
<br>
Also, it's not like jboots, you have to be stationary. Can and does get interrupted.  Slightly longer cast than normal Levitation.  Weighs 5 and takes up an inventory slot.  Can and should be hotkeyed.<br>
