The barriers of shock wave enrgy from the 'big bang' could just be a small ball in further reaches of infinity. Too far to measure anything in miles or even light years or centuries.<br>
<br>
What I have always wondered is what space equates to... What is it of? Maybe will know after death :)<br>
<br>
I do belive in somthing higher for sure though. I belive we become our 'true' selves when we die. Think about it. Much of our feelings and emotions are based on our bodies.. our brains, hormones, etc.. Our thought is limited by our brain too, not only just emotions.<br>
<br>
It would only make sense that once we join or become our true self after death that we will inherit unlimited knowledge and understanding.<br>
<br>
Probably is not any languages either. We can communicate with our feelings that will be so vast it would consist of millions of 'words'(feelings). Everyone would always know your will and meaning.<br>
<br>
The way we were here on earth would not carry on most likly. We are ignorant, emotional, war drivin..etc..etc.. In the afterlife we no longer have our brain and those primitive emotions and feelings will be gone. Even sexual feelings albiet good or bad.<br>

I love this stuff.  I personally believe in God, but do not limit him to popular beliefs about he created thing, etc.  I believe in the &quot;Big bang&quot; or some similiar occurance, seeing as scientists too are questioning the Big Bang.  Many disagree with my next statement, and please make any points against it, I enjoy hearing peoples opinions.  I believe science and God can and do go together.  Anyone familiar with the Bible has read where God &quot;speaks&quot; everything to existence.  I just recently read a book about super-string theory.  The basic jist of the theory says that the most basic particle in matter is a string.  This string vibrates at different frequencies, the rate of which is what makes helium, helium, or hydrogen, hydrogen.  If this frequency changes, the element changes.  Now, taking this one could argue that everything is essentially made from sound, and for those who believe in God, whatever form he may be for you, the voice of that God.  Mind you, this statement was written by a non-religious man, so take it as you may.  What I find interesting is one of the most devout atheists, Carl Sagan, told his collegues that after all the reasearch and studies he had done, he could not see how the universe we live in could possibly exist by accident.  There has to be some greater power involved for all this to exist.  These are just a few small examples.  I would have to write a book to go through all of them.  Bottom line is, believe what you want, that is your right.  However, no one should EVER make any beliefs of this matter without doing research yourself.  If you believe what you believe just because that is how you were raised and taught, shame on you.  Go out and learn on your own, then make your decision, whether it is about the existence of God, or or whether you prefer Chevy over Ford.  The only time I will ever attack anyone for their beliefs is if they just blindly believe them with no reason except that is what they know.  I have 100 times the respect for the devout atheist that believes what he believes because he took the time to study and make up his own mind what he believes than the band-wagon christian that shares my beliefs just because he or she was raised that way.   <br>

             I just look at it this way...as my husband told me.  If you don't believe in God..and you are wrong and there IS one..you are pretty much screwed.  If you DO believe in GOD and there is one..you are covered.  If you DO believe..and there isnt' one..........well..whats the worse that can happen?  You live a more honest, caring, loving lifestyle as a result of believing in him.  Certainly dosn't hurt to have a little faith and believe in him in my book.  I think it makes me a better person for it.........ok...that's my opinion for what it's worth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
This covers a majority of the beliefs out there, and begins with a truth - since we are all sure to die. <br>
<br>
For the most part, I don't believe in a god, because he is too mysterious. For that same reason, I don't believe in a Big Bang. So how did I come to be? I don't know, and don't have the resources to find out. Therefore, I choose not to dwell on that which is ambiguous enough to complicate my short life and in the end give me no truth, only beliefs - but what good are beliefs when you're dead?<br>
<br>
Supposing that I:<br>
<br>
- Return to that plane of truth, somewhere that beliefs would be useless, since the truth is available and absolute.<br>
<br>
- Return as another life; but if I believe this, then I know I can't remember my past lives, and the beliefs of this life will therefore no longer serve me.<br>
<br>
- Stand before a god? Does he care about my beliefs, or only my actions? Do I have to die for my god, or just go to church in order to be saved? How often do I have to go to church? Must I not commit 'sins', or can I simply ask for this god's forgiveness? The chance that my beliefs in life will lead me into favor with such an ambiguous god seem stageringly small.<br>
<br>
- And if death is the end, in the same way that billions, trillions, or perhaps an infinite amount of time passed instantly for me before I was concious - the rest of eternity will elapse in the same manner and my beliefs will have been absolutely nothing in the sceme of everything.<br>
<br>
<br>
So -- I live my life not worrying about things which are so ambiguous. I accept that either Something or Nothing will happen when I die, and I choose to accept that I cannot change what happens. If people decide they must devote themselves to accumulating beliefs - I only ask they stay out of my way, because my life is short and I while I'm living it, I don't need your annoyances.<br>
<br>
I suppose if you like labels you can put me in your little folder under skeptic. If what you like to do is gather beliefs about others, anyway.<br>
<br>
Is anything written here a belief of mine? Not really - just analysis and explaination of my views. I wouldn't classify it as a belief, because I know everything could be wrong. Except of course, for death.  <p><table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 >

I'm a Christian, I'm not ashamed so I'll get that right out. What Lenea said was exactly what I was going to say (or had said had you read the ACLU debate thread), and even atheists have to see some sort of reasoning in it. I've questioned the existance of God, a lot actually. But every time I do, all I have to do is look up into the sky, look at the trees, the birds, and realize that this couldn't have happened by just some freak accident. Evolutionists believe the world came to be out out nothing. Creationists believe it to come from God. Evolutionists say it happened by science. But you still are having faith in what's being told to you is correct. It's the same as Christianity and Creationism. You have to have faith to believe that some God who has been here forever, created all of this. Ya, it's a stretch, but I think believing in a Creator is a lot less of one than some molecules coming from nothing. For that matter evolution is still a THEORY, nothing more. Most of the time, theorys are usually not taken seriously until they are facts because they aren't facts. There has been no solid undeniable shred of evidence for evolution. No missing links, and carbon dating just well, isn't accurate past 6,000 years or so. We have to put our faith somewhere, it just all depends where. And for me, I've chosen in the God of the Bible. <br>

Lol, and I thought this was a serious subject. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Look, faith is what keeps people going. It might be faith in God, science, your favorite baseball card, whatever...if it gives you hope and a sense of safety and happiness, then it's done it's job. The only thing specific faiths have ever done is to teach it's followers values inherit to it's beliefs. Good, or bad. Here is the problem. Religion. Religion is not faith, or believing in faith. Religion is not about values, or beliefs. It is a tool used on the masses. It's not called a christian religion, or a muslim religion, it's called a christian faith or a muslim faith. Religion is used nowadays as a slang term, but hundreds of years ago it was used to commit some very horrible crimes. There was a joke in WW 2, about who's side God was on. Form whatever conclusions you want, but if I was God, I'd feel like my name was dragged in the mud and hung out to dry. And to answer the joke, it obviously wasn't the Germans. But that's the point really, is that it is all objective, and subjective to the individuals point of view.<br>

<br>
A theory is not a &quot;truth&quot; it is educated guesswork therfore not fact. Faith is not required to contemplate theory.<br>
<br>
The big bang is theory not fact. <br>
<br>
Evolution to some is fact because there is enough physical evidence for them to come to a conclusion. Some people don't accept evolution as fact and still consider it just a good theory with a lot of circumstancial evidence.<br>
<br>
There are some Christian scientists who like evolution have compiled circumstancial evidence and believe &quot;God&quot; is a fact. Other religious people rely only on faith and consider &quot;god&quot; to be more than philosophical theory.<br>
<br>
It all eventually comes down to the individual to decide. Personally I don't see evidence of &quot;god&quot; and lean to contemplate scientific theory as a realistic and pragmatic foundation that can be tested in order to discover the provable.<br>

<br>
Somone already posted about it but &quot;Energy can not be created nor destroyed&quot;<br>
<br>
I belive we are energy, Not our concious mind but our higher self or our &quot;soul&quot;. <br>
<br>
Our energy has lived to ETERNITY and will continue to do so. The reason we have no memory of this is because we are limited by our mortal organic mind. Our mind was activated the day we were born. That is all we can remember because the concious mind is of the brain.<br>
<br>
When we die I belive that once our organic mind is no longer part of our thought that we will know eternity. We will still probably remeber our life because our &quot;spirit&quot; was totaly aware of it. More than likly our spirit never left the planes of infinity. Only our concious mind has to exist here on earth in the body of the host.<br>
<br>
When you die you may come to find out that you are not human in appearance in any way. I belive all the beings of the universe are this such infinit energy.<br>
<br>
All will be explained in good time. You may be living many lives as you read this.<br>
<br>
The thing though about infinity is there is no begining nor ending. Either is impossible with infitity. Time is reletive and belived to only exist within the 3rd dimension of space. That could mean that the Universe was NEVER created, it was just there FOREVER and will always be there forever. We don't understand how things work without time and further how within infitity. We don't know. But we will, when you die.<br>
<br>
I have never been afraid of death and never will be, It is a vital occurance that has to happen.<br>
<br>
While I belive in thwe existance of higher being or beings I do not belive that the belife in ONE being is the only way for salvation after death. Too many people belive not of such, they were never exposed to it period. And what about the billions/trillions/quadillions of other planets?<br>
<br>
I definatly belive in Christ though. Too many written accounts, paintings, and stories to belive otherwise. Jesus is FACT. Roman logs even speak of him and his death, Roman govenors don't put wild stories in their logs, They take those matters seriously! But weather you belive that Christ is God or not... that is up to you to decide. It would explain a few things that he was totaly aware of his higher being though. Jesus was limitd by his mortal mind and body but he had a conection(some belive &quot;subconcious&quot;) to his higher being that allowed him to create such miracles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujensorthetonedeaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jensor the Tonedeaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/30/02 1:21:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17303.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> I don't think living in fear is a good way to run your life.

I think it's very conceited to think that you know everything about what's going on in the universe.  To me, the Big Bang theory seems illogical - how could two molicules be floating around, hit each other, then suddenly turn into a universe?  Plus, if there was no universe to begin with - where did these molecules come from?  Also, how can you truly explain infinity?  For there to be ANYTHING, there must be infinity... just think about it.  So to say you have the answers to all these questions via any method is conceited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showMessageRange?topicID=17303.topic&start=261&stop=266>14</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showPrevMessage?topicID=17303.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showNextMessage?topicID=17303.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17303.topic&index=35><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.threadControl?topicID=17303.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17303.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=17303.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home<option value="prexus95980frm22">Neverwinter Nights</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general>General</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
