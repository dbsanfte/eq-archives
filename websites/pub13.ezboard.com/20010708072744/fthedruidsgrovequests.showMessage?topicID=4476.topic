For those still looking for Faydedar strategy I hope following will be of some use. <br>
<br>
We had 4 to 6 groups for the raids, most are low 50s. <br>
<br>
<br>
Rule of thumb for making groups are:<br>
<br>
1. Each group should have 1 cleric and at least one backup healer (55+ shaman/druid or preferably another cleric)<br>
<br>
2. At least 2 lv57+ warriors, or 2 lv60 paladin/SK as your main tanks. <br>
<br>
3. Fill in rest with as many melee class as you can with some casters on the side. Having high level mage/shaman/chanter to debuff Fay will make the fight much easier. Tash/Maloshi line of spells will make spells land MUCH easier. And if one of the shaman/chanter manages to land slow then Fay is as good as dead.<br>
<br>
4. If you are short on clerics, assign them to tank groups. 2 druid/shaman can keep caster group alive if they do their job right. <br>
<br>
<br>
Buffs:<br>
<br>
1. 6 junk buffs before good ones, use JBoots as top most buff. I think Fay only dispells 1 buff at a time so clicking on JBoots will prevent good buffs get dispelled, or at least slow it down. You can use spells like Resist Poison/Disease, See Invis, Resist Cold, Endure Breath, etc as junk buff<br>
<br>
2. Resist Magic and Resist Fire (better yet Circle of Winter) should be at the very end of your buff list. Those 2 goes long way in keeping you on battle field.<br>
<br>
3. Mage/wizard damage shield both give extra fire resist, especially mage ones. Use those to gain extra boost in FR if needed.<br>
<br>
Note: with 237 FR and lv56, damage I was taking from Fay's AE range from full resist to 400+. I'd imagining FR lower than 170 will take some serious hurting from Fay's AE.<br>
<br>
<br>
Killing Faydedar:<br>
<br>
Few things to watch out for before spawnning Faydedar. There are 3 NPCs not related to Fay in hidden oasis. All 3 of them can be found around the inn. In one of our earlier attempts, Fay's AE hit the NPCs and instead of killing Fay, they healed Fay. We were wiped out as result of it. When we were going for Fay the first time last weekend, one of the NPC was standing on the bridge, dangerously close to Fay's spawn spot. We pulled him all the way to the far east wall with a monk and he stay there through out the whole weekend. Just before you spawn Fay, have all casters go to SW corner and make sure they are all STANDING. I think casters medding while Fay being spawned is one of the main cause for ping pong effect. Have main tanks sit by the dwarf to draw aggro and all the other tanks stand ready behind main tank. Once Fay is down to 50%ish, have casters unload on it and Fay goes down fast after that.<br>
<br>
Note: SW corner may not be the best spot to position casters because Fays AE can still hit them. Perhaps having them wait in the tunnel leading to hidden oasis is better.<br>
<br>
We were able to kill Fay with as few as 6 death out of 27. Being on PvP server, very few of us had epic weapon/uber armor etc, but most of us have good resists. Prep work took a while but it was worth it. Good luck to those still needing to kill Faydedar and hope this info helps.<br>
<br>
One last thing, I was amiable to Gorenaire (sp) in DL before last weekend. After taking 2 faction hits for killing Faydedar (died once in 3 raids), I became threatening and was chased by Gorenaire. Killing vampires in MM gives + RoS faction I think... I'll probably need to spent some time in MM to repair my faction. Being chased by Gorenaire wasn't fun. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaxercis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Axercis</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/7/01 10:10:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukorwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Korwin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/7/01 10:36:17 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://lordfate.homestead.com/files/misc/KorAysa3.jpg height=162 width=109></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some info for those looking for Faydedar strategy</span><hr size=1> We just did fay last thursday, and I noticed that he doesn't dispell nearly as much as Vox/Naggy.<br>
<br>
At the end of the fight my warrior had only lost 2 buffs (first 2 of 4 junks).  Also, on a melee, 6 junk buffs is too much.  With 4 on me, I had a full 15 buffs (ie bard song wouldn't have held).<br>
<br>
There's also a delay between handing in the essence and fay actually showing up.  Was about 20 seconds or so before we saw the leezard coming through the water towards the beach.<br>
<br>
Also remember, the biggest killer on dragon raids is the BREATH, not the melee.  500 point AE hitting 30 people at once is a hell of a lot more damage than he could ever do in melee.  So make sure your raid group has good resists, min of 80+ unbuffed. <p><IMG SRC="http://lordfate.homestead.com/files/misc/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utwyg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twyg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/7/01 12:15:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some info for those looking for Faydedar strategy</span><hr size=1> Two tanks sitting in wolf form by Dolgin = Faydedar out of the water and aggroed on tanks in less than 6 seconds.  Put the casters as far back in the tunnel as possible till needed (we DMF'd ours and had them over the water in the very back of the tunnel).  <br>
<br>
Get your FR as high as possible, even at the expense of your main stats.  Nothing worse for a healer than seeing ALL the tanks needing healed at once.  <br>
<br>
Four groups is good if most everyone is 53+, but five groups is better.  I would go as high as six groups if you have several people between 49 and 53. <p><HTML>
