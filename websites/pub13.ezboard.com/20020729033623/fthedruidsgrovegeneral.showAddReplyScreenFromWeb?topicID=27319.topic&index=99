<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of people in this world: doormats and boots...:)<br>
<br>
Actually, I don't choose to see only the negative side, I simply recognize that it is there.  I also recognize that there is a positive side as well.  A glass that is half-full is also half-empty.   And as I pointed out a while back, the really interesting question is if you drink all the remaining water in the glass, is it then full or empty?  Both, of course.<br>
<br>
This is true for the POTC quest.  For those of us who do tradeskills or love puzzle-quests, it is a fun way to introduce a new spell.  And for those of us who focus solely on raiding and XPing with no thought for tradeskilling, the material rewards, in terms of what is available in the game, are not really worth the time and expense (the person who completed the quest first estimated his expenses at 15K).  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>I just ignore Scirroco on his opinons of Verant because he is always trying to make it into some kind of confrontation that has never existed.</b><br>
<br>
If you are referring to my cracked glass comment, it was simply a reference to the fact that the game itself is not without flaws, and thus is at least partially responsible for the half-full/half-empty status of the glass (i.e., the water leaked out).<br>
<br>
As for a confrontation that never existed, I can only assume you are a recent newcomer to EQ.  The three elements of VerantSpeak that I promulgated over a year ago as a sardonic commentary on Verant's approach at the time struck home because there WAS a bit of truth behind each one.<br>

Were you out there dropping your plat, figuring out where things were, seeing what combined at what triviality?<br>

The quest was a joke.  It was nothing more than a way to drain Druids of their time and their &quot;phat lewtz from farming all day&quot;.  I have little doubts that had the complaints not flowed furiously, it would still be what it is.<br>

<br>
Seems to me that the moderators recognize that people who play druids have some valid complaints about how Verant has developed (or underdeveloped) the class; and this is probably the best place to discuss those grievances, propose ideas, and get the druid community's feedback.<br>
<br>
You can say druids are whining that the glass is half empty if you want, but it's all about perspective -- I say &quot;they are discussing issues&quot; and you say &quot;they are whining&quot; -- so who's being more negative here?<br>

Some of you take a balanced view and don't complain about the &quot;whining&quot; to much but don't condone it.  Then there are those that....Well if so so many druids are &quot;whining&quot; then I dare say something must be amiss in the dev room.  SOme say, oh the board used to be soooo nice, was no &quot;whining&quot; from the druids.  Well maybe that is why we are where we are today, Last class citizens of Norrath. ( and any other zone/world they want to call it).  It has been an ongoing thing for verant to give the other classes more and more perks, and sometimes throwing a bone our way to try and appease us. At the same time making our class weaker and weaker in comparision to the other classes and the advancement of the game.  I thought this board was to express the druids life in EQ and if you don't like the &quot;whining&quot; then go find another board.  Alot of the whiner complainers are from other classes anyway.  Alot of the druid ones haven't played the game from its inception and really have little clue, and most of the rest haven't played a druid past 55 or been in an end game raiding guild.  <br>
And to those of you who like the PotG quest, power to you and I hope you all get through it.  For me at level 60 it is but another time sink that I really will not be doing.  This &quot;whining&quot; level 60 for so long druid thinks VI has more serious things to contend with in the druid class, and that they should start being serious about dealing with them.<br>

<br>
Selldor, there is a big difference between expressing opinions and whining about intermediary items in a not-yet-completed quest. There will be a patch, and if you [the proverbial you] have any sense of reason at all, you'll wait to see...<br>
<br>
1. How this quest will have changed after Xanthe's completion of it.<br>
2. How "much easier" it will be to acquire the spell scroll.<br>
3. The quest continuation and the FINAL reward, and if it is worth the time.<br>
<br>
These are all unknowns at this point, and complaining about them is PREMATURE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoveries.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Overies</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.li.net/~hexar/aolpicsm.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#333399>(5/12/02 6:59:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27319.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> So far the final reward is BS..<br>

But, If they jack up the final reward to something shawl-like I might get my skills up.<br>
<br>
It took Xan 12k and 30 hours to get his skills up to what they are in order to do the quest?<br>
<br>
Well I know my skills are really low, and a 5 wis earring isn't gunna be worth the 12k and all the time ..<br>
<br>
<br>
Hopefully POTC is really easy to get next patch, and the final reward is much better than what it is for the trade-skill people.<br>
<br>
The shawl doesn't take all THAT much time to do, if you have 180+ in each trade skill.. So I think that this quest should be something of near-equal value.. (it'd also be another way to get more focus items into the game that verant seems to like so much)<br>

Actually, you have no idea if the negative input had anything to do with the changes.  Its just really odd to me that so much *supposedly* is changing from what the quest originally was, and really coincides with alot of the complaints.  Regardless, why not give a premature opinion?  What stopped us from giving an opinion on the Shawl quest that was never finished?  In fact, it makes alot of sense that Verant is going to change the quest based on the opinions of hte players, and thats probably what happened.  <br>
<br>
Unless, you think all this was one master plan, you know the usual implement something then change it completely around to something else after the first person completes it.  Sure, it was all intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What you see as whines, others simply see as negative opinions.

There is little chance any discussions over the last few days had any effect on the quest.  The dev and test were done way before now and the plans to implement the quest differently after it is first solved would have been in place weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Had this quest taken a few weeks to solve (instead of less then a week) and the negative posts against it been consistant over those weeks then maybe your thoery would have some merit.  But coming from a software related career i can tell you that things rarely happen that fast unless there is a fairly high impact production bug(known as a "hotfix")... this was certainly not on that level and was a planned release from all indications.<br>

I am confident in saying that the change to the aquisition of the spell after the first person solved the quest along with any upgrade to the earring or spell for Xanthe was in place long before the quest went live and is more then earned.  <br>
<br>
I am looking forward to seeing what the changes will be... I hope this spell doesnt end up on a vendor and I hope Xanthe is well rewarded for the effort. <p><table border="0">

<br>
Easy for you to hope this...you don't play the class and were never the level required to use it.<br>
<br>
Every other skin spell we have, except PotG, were vendor sold spells.<br>
<br>
PotG was dropped, primarly because when it was released, it was one of the best buffs in the game.<br>
<br>
I hope Xanthe gets a hell of a lot more than the spell and that POS earring, because its not worth the effort involved for this quest otherwise.<br>
<br>
Foxfyre,<br>
<br>
Yes..you can buy each of the 9 items off a grandmaster.  But what grandmaster is going to sit down collect the items needed (from all over the place...) and make the items needed?  None.  You will have to go collect everything, make the elixirs, make the dusts, then hunt down the appropriate grandmaster and then HOPE he succeeds.<br>
<br>
226 smithing with 5% geerlok...failed the sickle final combine like 5 times.  That's 15 imbued emeralds, 5 normal emeralds, 5 rubies, 5 sapphires, 15 sheets of metal, a smithing hammer, a slew of mistletoe, celestial solvent, and blood of velious.  And I still don't have a sickle.<br>
<br>
The quest needs to have a seriously upgraded reward (something to make a Sanctum Guardian's Earring look a bit weak) or a serious reduction of difficulty and cost.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't, I'm going to be very very upset...even more so than I am now..because I've already blown my plat on this quest.  I want something from it something that's an upgrade..and a significant one.<br>

<br>
it takes me less than one minute to med 700 mana or so<br>
<br>
it would take probably a day to do this quest in its current form.<br>
<br>
hmm Need Math help !!   but right now this doesnt seem worth it for me = )<br>
<br>
I will still just use the group version to buff myself.<br>
<br>
As for the creativeity and way the quest was done, and the fact it will change, that is nice, BUT if I were Verant, I would start saying it will be the first person to solve PER server, then that would cut down on spoilers, and make the whole game much more fun to figure out for all of us.<br>

Logically that should not be a big challenge for them if that is the solution we see implemented.<br>
<br>
Another easy fix is that they minimize the process and have you complete say one of the gifts to get the reward.  <br>
<br>
I would say we will never know for sure if they went into this planning to change it.  As far as calling em liars about it, well that is the business world.  I don't think less of them about it it is just the way business works.  Not saying they did, just saying no one here will ever know.<br>
<br>
I will say on the question of whether it was planned it would be interesting to see if the original verant comments someone here had posted about the spell said &quot;an interesting way to introduce the spell into the game&quot; more or less.  Someone had said we should be excited about this quest, and maybe it would be interesting to see that exact phrasing (&quot;introduce the spell&quot; or &quot;get the spell&quot;).  <br>
<br>
At any rate, the new recipes are enough to make me dust off my trade skills and try some of them again.  I spent a little while last night on the smithing I need to get the sewing kit I need to build the skills I need to make the bag....gah.<br>
<br>
Boring as hell.  Not why I play this game.  But I am willing to put in time on one or two skills to get some of the neat things that can be gotten.  Just would rather have seen the spell quest be more rational than a big tradeskill quest.  Still, I hope that fancy new reward is better than the earing.  I am headed towards this quest but would like the reward to be more reflective of a commitment on par with the shawls.<br>
<br>
Hope Xathan gets super uber reward (ie artifact)...he sure deserves it ). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 1416<br> <font color=#333399>(5/13/02 1:21:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27319.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <i>Actually, you have no idea if the negative input had anything to do with the changes.</i><br>

<br>
But the trivial point on some of the repice are to way high. It already hard to find a 250 grand master in tailloring, smithing or fletching (only a few by server). To find a 250 brewer, potter or baker it nearly imposible (because of the 0 raison to be one, unless you want to be the only one in eq).<br>
<br>
I hope that for the price of the ingredient, that the trivial level will drop (in the 100-200 range will be perfect).<br>
<br>
Also the final earing is a bit weak, at level 50+, pure wisdow/mana/hp aren't so interesting, I have hit the 200+ wisdom mark, I am loking for item with wisdom/mana, ac and other stats (or focus effect?).<br>
<br>
Some of the gift crafted are good to very good items, <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Champagne Magnum:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
     *-All I can say, funaly some champagne in EQ.<br>

<br>
       *-Nice 1 hs weapond, good to pratice the skill and for it stats as weapond, before you get your epic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Golden idol of Tunare:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> primary/seconday/ranged, AC 4, WIS 5, mana 40, sv dis 6, sv pois 6<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Blessed fishing rod</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Primary hand, 5% fishing modifier, STR 10, recommended level 1, wt 2.2<br>
<br>
       *-If it didn't broque when you use it when fishing, it can be interesting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Star Ruby Encrusted Stein </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> primary or secondary, CHA 5, mana 20, 10 all saves <br>
<br>

<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Lotus Pie</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> : miraculous meal<br>
<br>
        *-Nice for it duration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Finaly; if Verant put the quest so hard is to give something to the fist player that finish it, and after it done for the first time, put it dificulty to a raisonnable level. All I can say is woot, because the game is becoming a lot more interative.<br>

Except if someone falls into the second group they should realize they will inevitably miss part of the game, this spell being possibly one of them and who knows what else to come.  Unfortunately, many of those who seem to fall into the second group have chosen to cry a river about this implementation instead of letting the first group enjoy the implementation in peace... <br>
<br>
As far as doormats and boots... there is always a right way and a wrong way to become a boot... that is the lesson many "boots" around here have failed to learn yet.  Not to mention, many times the people who seem to be doormats are really getting more stuff done behind the scenes then any boot will ever get accomplished.  :) <p><table border="0">
