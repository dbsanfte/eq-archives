I am new at this message board writing but I was on the brellserillis.net and saw guild listings.  I saw Evoluxa on the list and came here.  I just wanted to thank one of your members: alluveal.  I was grouped with her the other night in city of mist.  It was myself a monk, a warrior and a cleric.  Just the four of us were doing really well when a huge train came and pretty much took out our party.  Everybody by the cleric died and if you have ever been to the mist city you know there can be some really bad trains.  I was bound just outside in emerald jungle.  I zoned through and was immediately hit by another train and killed before I could zone back.  To make things even worst when I repopped in EJ I was killed a third time by a gorilla that someone brought to the zone.  It was really unlucky and I was so frustrated that I was about to retire for good.  I was level 41 so I lost my level after those three deaths and was in hell again.  Alluveal was there and told me not to worry.  I was so mad that I told her I didn't care and that I was going to EC to give my stuff away as soon as I could find a port.  Well one wizard responded to my request for a port then after a few minutes he just left saying that the plans had changed.  I was about to log off at this point and give up and just delete everything.  I was swearing in my group and making a huge scene.  Alluveal told me to please wait and she then called a friend cleric of hers over to rez us.  She was a level 55 with an epic and he came all the way to EJ just to rez me.  She rezzed all three of my bodies and I got my level back.  Come to find that Alluveal had begged the wizard to go away and not port me and paid him for his time and trouble then had told him that I was just frustrated and to please not take me anywhere just yet.  She knew I had to be saved from myself.  The cleric told me that she tried to give her one of her items to pay for coming so far, but that she would not take it that it was her pleasure.  She said I should be lucky to have a friend like that  I have to thank her too as well.  She told me that if something like that happened again to sit in a safe spot and walk away from the computer for a few minutes, that even though the game might make you crazy, that deleting a character or something is not the way to go.  I just cannot believe that somebody would go out of there way to beg a wizard not to port me off and then beg a friend cleric to come rez somebody she didn't even know that well.  So thank you Alluveal, I know I already did thank you but I see you have posted here and you might see this.  You are a great chanter.  Most just sit there but you were doing stuff I thought was very cool with the mezzing and stuff and your roleplaying was making the group so much fun with you and the monk lizard talking about the dark elves and Freeport and stuff.  There was one time I knew we were all going to die and you moved so fast to mez the golums that I was like damn!  You spioled me and I never had to ask for Haste.  I laughed because you had this little timer you said you kept just for warriors and their haste. This also looks like a way cool guild to be in but I already have one I'm joining and I think this one is a little too fancy for me.  :o)   Thank you thank you thank you thank you and I just wanted to say that.  I'm going to post this in another place I saw too.  Thank you alluveal.  Please look me up if yo uwant to group again in Mist City.<br>

Verga level 41 SK  I do not have a picture for my name but maybe you can make me one, alluveal.  Email me at Sliver1999@zensearch.net<br>

Wow.. thank you.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   woo hoo!  Quitting isn't the answer.  I remember one night in Great Divide, hunting Shardwurms.  I died 7 times that night.  One after the other.  I only got 3 of those rezzed.  I was grouped with Vresk, a monk from V.H. and I remember after about the 5th death, I was sitting at my bind point, naked as a jaybird, shivering my inkie bum off.  I sat there frustrated to the point of tears.  Vresk pulled me aside and said &quot;look, this happens.  We all have levels like this.&quot;  It was level 37 for me.  I will never forget that cruel, horrible, EVIL level!  I'll never forget his words.  He put up quite a sum to get me resurrected.  One of his guildies traveled through 5 or 6 zone to perform the duty.  I thought to myself &quot;wow, if he's willing to talk to me and take me aside and keep me from losing my mind, then it can't all be that bad.&quot;  I died 2 more times after that and just rolled with it.  I plan to pay another visit to those shardwurms someday.  Oh yes, I do.  Perhaps when you are level 50, you and I can go to CoM and say hello to some of your little gollum friends.  Get a little payback!  <br>
<br>
I also remember being around level 7 or 8 and hunting those halflings in Nektulos.  Rollo.  That stupid little..... (bleeping) halfling.  Killed me more times than I can count.  Every time I am in Nektulos, I make a special trip to see Rollo (and Travis T. as well, but don't tell Quemn!)  I charm the little guy and trot around Nektulos with him, hitting my /pet guard me hot key as often as I like.  Rollo says &quot;Guarding you master&quot;.  Ahh, music to my ears!  You have no idea!  I get a small bit of comfort doing that.  Brings tears of joy to me eyes!  (sniffles).  I remember 40-41 being hard levels for me.  It seemed I was really in an awkward level for my class.  It happens.  You can't take the game too seriously.  There is a lot of frustration to be had and some really useless BS that you deal with from time to time but in the end, it's about having fun and not letting things bother ya too much.  =)  Life is too short to spend fretting and worrying about things you can't change or about the people that try to make this game negative for you.  Ya pick your battles.  If I EVER see you in EC giving away your stuff, I will flog you!<br>
<br>
Anyway, blahblahblah!  I'm so long winded.  Jelen (fellow guildie) is gonna have to give up his title of the guild yammerer.  <br>
