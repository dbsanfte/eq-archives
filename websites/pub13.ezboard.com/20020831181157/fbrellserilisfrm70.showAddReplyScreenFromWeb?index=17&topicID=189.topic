class=title>   Re: Everquest 2 Official</span><hr size=1> Obviously everyone is going to have their own opinion and desire to play EQ2 is highly upto personal taste. I for one however am relieved to hear that EQ1 will not disapear in another year and a half. At first i assumed it would go away and i was somewhat depressed.. many things in PoP will hardly even be done much by the time EQ2 comes out. It takes a LONG time for stuff to get truly old. 3 - 4 years from now, perhaps then. But EQ is massive in its range of places to see and things to do and classes to do it in. I have been playing for over 2 years and i for one still have many things i want to do and see that would take longer then another year and a half to complete.<br>
<br>
Me i am almost positive that i will stay with EQ1. My machine can handle EQ2 just fine, the new graphics may be cool, and while i enjoy new things in games instead of the same ole, the feature list by far is everything i dislike in a game. Lets take this point by point from the post on the safehouse. Both good and bad..<br>
<br>
Back to the &quot;Old World&quot;. Ok this is fine.. they have to have room to expand the game. If they already have machines to support all these expansions, operating costs are too high before any new expands arrive.<br>
<br>
All of the roleplay stuff like Iksar being nomadic and Kerran's instead of Vah Shir, i'm sure the story will reflect why this is and all of these story elements seem cool enough to me.<br>
<br>
Mobs chasing you through zones. This may be realistic but quite frankly i am not a fan of this. I always just considered zoning as &quot;you got far enough away&quot;.<br>
<br>
This 100 levels with 200 from expansions. I have never been a fan of quick unimportant levels. My background has brought me up on few levels.. AD&amp;D if you were 30 you were insanely high, Sojourn MUD maxed out at 50. And of course EQ that maxed at 50 with later on the 10 &quot;hero&quot; levels. So over the last 16 years of gaming both online and off, i've come to enjoy quality over quantity, not the other way around.<br>
<br>
Also this 30 minutes to attain 6, and increasing specialisation from there. If you accept the 100 levels thing, this isn't such a bad system. But for me, while skill tree's and the like may be more realistic, i prefer structured classes and i want to make those choices up front. EQ2 may not wind up this way, but having a slew of half-assed classes just is lame. role's are not so clearly defined. Its a cheesed mess.<br>
<br>
Here we come to my big beef. Knowledge skill and the like. Level based items, breakable items, etc.. i despise this. always have, always will. Its too many restrictions. And it is all in the name of trying to defeat twinking. Twinking is an important part of just about any game and people are not going to want to start from dead scratch every time they have an interest in a new class. This is just lame. You ruin people's fun and you ruin replayability. I would say it ruins the worth of lesser items and the economy which is based mostly on twinking exept they seem to be trying to create a player-makes/sells-item economy. If this is going to be the way it is, why are most people even going to want to raid? I do things to see them, many people however do things for what they can get. And if there ARE high end drops, the player made stuff quickly becomes obsolete.. and you are right back where you started.<br>
<br>
More personal dislikes that are slated to be in EQ2 include: 1) This new experience &quot;debt&quot; crap. Thats just lame. Its trying to trick people into not getting disgruntled. The standard exp loss-rez system that has worked for online games in this lineage for the last decade is fine and good. 2) Bind Points. I've become happy with the current system. Wish they'd leave it alone. 3) Hit Locations. Again, more realistic.. but i have seen this before in online games and i am not a fan. And 4) Localized banks. Realistic, but Realism has always cost in terms of Playability. I don't think what one suffers in playability is worth what one gains in realism in this case. If they want to have caravans, let them have trade caravans and trade markets where a master trademan could make his fortune buying an selling good between towns.<br>
<br>
The only truly cool thing i see is the ability to buy a plot and build a community with your friends or as a guildhouse.. Sadly this can not only be implemented badly by having everyone crowded together but most people probably won't get much use out of them even if they do buy them.<br>
<br>
In my opinion the majority of these changes seem to be to make people play how THEY think you SHOULD play rather then how you WANT to play. Sure there are outspoken people who say twinking and the like is a bad thing. But ask yourself how many people do and how many people don't? The answer to what the majority wants is pretty obvious.<br>
<br>
So combine the inability to play without all of this nonsense, with the loss of your established character that you have worked on for so long, and leaving behind all of the fun things that most still not have touched in EQ1 and i am left with the question, why the hell would i want to go to EQ2?<br>
<br>
Anyway as was said before, a year and a half is still a fair ways away. Maybe Verant will change some of these things due to public reaction. Given their track record however, i somehow doubt it. Time will tell..<br>
