No joke. I was thinking to myself, what would be a good way to work the druid into raids into a stackable sort of way, so that you don't end up wanting 2 Druids and nothing more, because you just feel better when someone is cleaning up that NO DROP Druid only loot, and you're not deleting uber loot. So... what if Druids were left almost exactly as they are, but they added some more powerful nukes and some pet spells. Become a primarily damage dealing class, with back up heals and buffs for small groups. <br><br>Nukes: <br>Upgrade the higher level nukes. Make them harder mob drops so that its not just the level that restricts who has it. The highest should be along the lines of 1200-1300, with a quest difficulty of about the Wizard Bane line of spells. The hardest to get would be like that finaly 2300 DD that Wizards can get, and would be 1500 or something close. <br><br>Pets: <br>Pets would be wolves, bears, caimans, tigers, or scaled wolves, depending on whether or not VI feels like instituting a NEW world model for Druid pets. The pet would be about 70-80% as good as the mage pet. It would be the same LEVEL but NOT the same POWER as the mage pet, so it could still deal damage on the same level mobs, while not doing as much. Conversely, there could be some added spell ability to the pets, in the same manner as the druid. For example, a level 60 druid summons a wolf pet. The pet can quad for say 10-20 pts less per round than the mage pet, but it can heal using Chloroblast and nuke using Fury of Air. While idle, it would heal nearby players. Also, and I know this is a bit odd, but how about allowing players to control which spells their pets cast? So mages can use fire pets to nuke, instead of using them to melee, because having Wizard pets that melee is kind of odd. <br><br>Heals: <br>Keep heals as they are, maybe add a low powered group heal, in case the druid needs to keep alive some casters, but nothing for tanks. <br><br>Buffs: <br>Verant really screwed up this one in my opinion. There are some major raid responsibilities: tank, heal, buff, rez, haste, slow, nuke. Three of those went to Clerics. Then VI claims everything else is balance, while one class retains those three abilities. Stupidity. In any case, leave this as it is, since Druids would become mainly damage dealing, its irrelevant other than soloing. <br><br>DoTs: <br>DoTs would be supplementary damage dealing spells, for soloing and the like, nothing else would change. <br><br>At this point in time, I don't think VI can realistically say that Druids are balance, or even anywhere near so. Just because they are given spells that help their group, does not mean they are any more balanced. With most of the functions that they can perform being given in more powerful denominations to other classes, the Druid class will HAVE TO become a damage dealing class. All of the buffing roles have been split among Clerics (HP and AC), Enchanters (Mana and Haste), and Shamen or.. Shamans? (Stats and Slow). A mix between any of these means nothing, because these classes are all available, and not many of them are needed because of the way in which buffs work. However, direct damage is a skill that CAN be split between classes. These skills go mainly to Magicians (Pets) and Wizards (Nukes). By giving something of each of those to Druids, then the would arguably be better than both those classes. Realistically though, the skill factor there is large, as they will need to figure out how to play both a Magician and a Wizard effectively, in terms of aggro, and pet mechanics and so on. Also, in a raid, the damage output of a Druid would be near or higher than a mage, but only because of nukes, with the pet being far inferior to the mage. Wizards would retain the highest DD output, though in an entire raid they might be outdone by a Druid who manages their mana wisely and their pet just so. Conversely, bad Druids would be able to do less damage, etc etc. <br><br>Other than this, the only way I could think to manage the Druid class properly would be something like a DoT DD. The Druid stands still and casts the spell. Then, every tick, the spell does damage, and drains mana, each turn, the damage goes up, and the mana stays the same. So the longer the Druid stands still, the more damage it does. Aggro would be cumulative, and the spell stops casting if the Druid moves, or is hit.This means stackability because of the DD component. It does not leave a lasting marker on the opponent, so other Druid DoTDDs would stick just fine. <br><br>Due to the immense lack of attention, or seriousness, that is given to the plight of Druids by Verant, I have decided to stop playing actively for the next month or so to see whether anything changes, then I will likely quit the game. I would suggest for any Druids who are in their lower levels that they change their class to something else. Frankly, a level 60 Ranger seems more useful than a level 60 Druid at this point in time. To any high level Druids who don't agree, e-mail me at Arradine@hotmail.com if you'd like to discuss it, or flame me here if that's your intention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uszaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Szaero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/02 5:51:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=678.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druid Role</span><hr size=1> As much as I agree that Druids are not terribly useful in raids..

At least that, or your an incredible optimist... so yes.. naive. Anyway... off the topic of idiots.. err optimists vs masochists... err pessimists... <br><br>You're assuming only Druids and Clerics. *slap* /em waves at the wizard. <br><br>So the Wizard takes nuking quite nicely from Druids. After all, why have 2 Druids when you can have 1 Wizard. Arguing efficiency and all doens't matter, mana flows at raids like beer at bad frat parties. As to rez and buff, those are semi-stackable in the same way as Druid healing, which DOES NOT count for half by any means. Try comparing our heals to a CH. When I said raid use by the way, I meant with every other class present, which makes our buffs pretty crappy. I mean, sure, you can have the Symbol POTC/G combination, and that's all well and good, but the difference is minimal, and you wouldn't care TOO much about it at a raid would you? If a Druid came in halfway you wouldn't drop your aego to get the combo unless you had nothing better to do, because it isn't a priority by any means. Our nukes? ... ... ... I won't bother to argue this point. Our nukes are fine, I suppose, about mage powered. Debuff? Only if you REALLY REALLY REALLY want those Fire nukes landed. Otherwise there are an array of other debuffs from other classes. If you want that to count for .2 that's fine, one of five resists right. That is absolutely NOT stackable by the way. Stackable means functional in a full way at almost any given time. Only 1-2 Druids are needed to cast this and then to recast when it fades. Debuffs do not stack, and therefore are irrelevant to the discussion. DoT? Same thing. Sure, you need 1-2 Druids, but no stackability there whatsoever, and no true NEED as you can get better ones elsewhere. <br><br>So, essentially, what I am complaining about is that we are too spread out. Druids should be more focused towards offense in my opinion, as defensive skills (Healing, Buffing, Hasting, Slowing)  are fairly taken up by Enchanters, Shamen, and Clerics.. as I think I said before. Anyway... Therefore, we need a stronger repertoire of offensive spells, that allow for more than one Druid on a raid, and also have the damage spread out in such a way that we can do more overall damage than a Wizard, but it would be spread out over time, in multiple ways. ie nukes, a pet, DoTDDs (allow casting while these are going maybe?), and maybe add something else. <br><br>Conversely... were VI to make more encounters with multiple mobs that altogether are as hard as a large boss, then becoming master AoErs might be a good avenue to pursue... but VI won't even cater to the players now, why would they cater to a specific group. Anyway.. <br><br>I'm not very lucid right now. I'll be back later to clarify this if I didn't make much sense, which I suspect.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utatankawd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatankawd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/4/02 3:56:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=678.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> &gt; After all, why have 2 Druids when you can have 1 Wizard<br><br>And I reject that argument, unless you are talking about uber guilds.<br><br>For most of us, in the guilds we belong to, the membership is what it is.

Your only tanks are a ranger and a rogue.  Neither damage nor healing is covered - a cleric and druid are both LFG - who do you choose?<br><br>In all three of those scenarios the &quot;pure class&quot; has more to offer than the &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; that has become the calling card of the druid.<br><br>When you're doing pick-up experience groups, the chance of anyone picking a druid over a cleric by knowledge of class only (meaning the group is made up of strangers), is near zero.  Yes, you can argue the whole &quot;damage shield, nuke, regen, heal&quot; all day long, but the point is it doesn't do much good if you're going oom every fight because of the amount of heals you have to do to get your tank back up to 80%+.<br><br>Same thing for a wizard - the wizard's nuke - as far as sheer power goes - is somewhat comparable to a druid nuke (until you start talking level 60).  The thing is, a wizard can nuke in every flavor (ice, fire, magic) and they can do it for more damage and less mana.  Wizards get their own self mana-regen lines as well as the familiar and harvest - which means that they can pretty much keep up with us on the lines of mana regen.  Also, if you're talking &quot;average&quot; gear, INT gear with +mana is much easier to come by than WIS with +mana.  So chances are, their manapool is larger than yours too.<br><br>The only real bonus that you've got in your favor is snare and a decent root.  I'd have to say that overall snare gets druids more groups than our healing/nuke abilities. <p><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#CCCCCC"><table border="0" bgcolor="#002675" cellpadding="4">  <tr>    <td width="100" bgcolor="#000000"><font face="Arial"><img src="http://web2.airmail.net/naomi/cards/storm1x2.jpg" width="100" height="200"></font></td>    <td width="250"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="4" face="Arial Black"><a href="http://www.elementofdarkness.com/eqi/new/inv.asp?char=197">Stormhaven the Druid</a></font>      <font face="Arial">    <br><font size="2">=============================</font>    <br><font size="2">Cazic Thule Server    <br>Wood Elf Hierophant of the 60th Level</font><br>    <br><font size="2"><a href="http://web2.airmail.net/naomi">Webmaster</a></font><a href="http://web2.airmail.net/naomi"><font size="2">      of SunWolf Designs</font></a></font></font></td>  </tr></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustormhaven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormhaven</A> at: 6/4/02 6:48:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhennethak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hennethak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/4/02 12:27:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=678.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Especially in Seb, any group without snare will soon be calling Train to Zone out, this has gotten me a few groups, but still most groups go to seb with their snarer already in hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utatankawd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tatankawd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/4/02 1:18:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=678.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Storm,<br><br>Therein lies the main point, then.

Harmony in rare instances - these can actually make a druid invaluable. Druids are often healers in groups at raids that don't have the main tank/secondary tank. Chain druid heals along with cleric cheal rotation have been the difference between a Venril Sathir kill and a total wipe.  Other than that.. my official job is to sit there and look pretty. =)<br><br>Think outside the box. A group consisting of 2 druids, a wizard, a shaman, a rogue and a mage can actually make a good group. And ALOT of fun. Typical warrior, rogue, cleric, chanter, ranger/paladin/mage, druid - get old very quick. Where's the challenge in that? =)<br><br>The ONLY problem I have with the druid is the wimpyness factor of the ae's.
