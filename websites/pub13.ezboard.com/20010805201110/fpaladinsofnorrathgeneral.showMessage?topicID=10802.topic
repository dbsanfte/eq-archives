The only classes I've had problem with so far is Shadowknight and Necromancer. <br>
<br>
A paladin have Celestial Cleansing, a very fast cast healing spell with good mana to heal ratio.<br>
<br>
A paladin have several buff's to increase their hp, ac, and resists.<br>
<br>
A paladin have lay hands.<br>
<br>
A Paladin have Divine aura.<br>
<br>
A paladin have the disc sactification which can be a very good disc to use if you time it right for example a harm touch.<br>
<br>
If you meet a caster and don't have a 2hs with enabled bash, use a 1hs and a shield.<br>
<br>
A warrior is cake, no we don't duel toe to toe, that's not a duel really. It's just matter of equipment.<br>
<br>
A ranger can be hard if he have his epic weapons because of the slow + DoT proc on it, usally resisted if you wear good resist items and have resist magic on. And if he lands a snare you can say bye bye. You shall focus to get up fire and magic resistance as high as possible.<br>
<br>
A monk is also a very easy target, after he have used his mend and you have resisted his instill doubt or moved away, alternative casted DA to avoid his disc he will be taken out easily.<br>
<br>
A rogue is like a monk, but without mend makes him/her to have even less hp. Make sure you have some perm see invis item on you. And can time DA if needed for a disc.. And if possible wear resist poison gear, the rogue's have some badass poison's. And never turn your back to them =p.<br>
<br>
A cleric, too easy. Gets oom on me too fast and can be dispatched easily. Wearing resist magic gear for the nukes he can cast is not needed, but is good. Keep chasing him/her.<br>
<br>
A bard can be a bit tricky, I havent really dueled many so I can't comment on them.. You need to try and keep resists high and dispatch him quickly and keep him stunned if possible.<br>
<br>
A druid gets oom on you pretty quick, make sure to wear resist cold, magic, fire. And keep chasing him/her and use bash to interrupt spells. <br>
<br>
A magician is easy too, flash of light his/her pet or root it. And focus on chasing around and hit the magician. You can always try as on every other caster to land a stun or holy might, but most likely it would be resisted, if not it's even an easier fight. Make sure to keep fire resist very high here.<br>
<br>
A necromancer is hard. At least for me, keep poison, disease resist high. Spook the dead his pet, and keep chase him so he can't land snare's (bash).<br>
<br>
Paladin vs pally, well not commenting on this one either.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knight is easy if you have your disease, and poison resists high and can time his HT with Lay Hands /or Sanctification. Note: a lvl 60 sk's HT does around 1500 dmg.<br>
<br>
Enchanter is easy as long you keep your MR high high. If he create's a pet either blind it or root it, you can't spend time on his easy pet. Keep chasing, dispell rune etc, and bash.<br>
<br>
Shaman is the same as a enchanter, except keep cold and poison resist's high. Mr too for the slow's etc.<br>
flash of light his pet or root it, even here dispell/chasing is essential with bash.<br>
<br>
Wizard ... keep all resists as high as possible, disease and poison is not too important but can be good as well. Try to time DA when he starts to cast some nasty spell, as well as Sanctification. With this he should be cake. Dispell diamond skin if needed, same on SK's if needed.<br>
And keep chasing and bash. <p><img src="http://returners.dhs.org/eq/darkd001.gif">

Not anymore and it hurts the class in real pvp fights. Two whole lines o spells made useless for us thanks to Mr Poe and Verant. :(<br>
<br>
Only level 59 paladins get CC. Dunnae help 99 percent o us who do battle e'ery day.<br>

<br>
Only level 60 paladins get Sanctification. Dunnae help 99 percent o us who do battle e'ery day.<br>
<br>
Fightin anyone with 1hs will get ya killed, unless it be uber. Ya need more damage ootput than most 1h will give ya. Always use 2hs wether it be epic basher or not.<br>
<br>
As ter fighten each different class, yer close eno on tactics fer most though with blue server rules alterin tha picture (fear,charm works for ya). Now try dueling any 2 or 3 o them at tha same time. That will give ya some idea what it be like walkin thru Gfay any given day on a Zek.<br>
<br>
Paladins must now wait until level 39 and Cancel Magic to have any hope of removing debuffs without using a pumice. That be a long time for ter wait when afore ah could do it from level 9 onward. We just lost 30 levels o defensive power to put it nicely. Where's tha balance Verant? Fookers!<br>

<br>
If you're a paladin on pvp do NOT think offensive. you want to kill people think SK, you want to really kill people think Necro or Druid.<br>
<br>
You know all the talk about how paladin's aren't useful in pve (I don't agree most of the time), in pvp they aren't lying... You can survive, you can run, you can sacrifice yourself and give someone else your loh, but imho our healing spells just don't have the punch to really help much...<br>
<br>
Wulfhere is absolutely correct, the new nerfs hurt the paladin pvp community immensely.<br>
<br>
I would NEVER suggest someone play a paladin in a pvp environment. AND I LOVE THIS CLASS.<br>

After 50, SK's rule pvp. Rogues come close after 55 (but they're horrible up until then). Druids and Necros are great from beginning to end.<br>

 Hiding and Invis will take you off targetting with the next patch on Sullon<br>
<br>
Spells cast before losing the target will resolve, so it will require some tactics to use properly.<br>
<br>
If the person that has you targetted has See Invis, it's easy to retarget if you are in line of sight.<br>
<br>
In addition, on Sullon, you will be able to steal coin (and ONLY coin) from other teams players, with some limitations I will leave you to discover on your own. <br>

Glad ter see Verant improve this, although it hurts tha good dwarves who cannae see invisible withoot ooside help.<br>
<br>
Ah also feel that target lock should be lost ifn tha target gets oota spell or archery range, which e'er be farther. It just plain dumb that a target lock cannae be affected by players. Suggestions ah have.<br>
<br>
1) Inivisible/Hide to remove target lock. This be done on Sullon soon now. Good.<br>
2) Evade/Jolt/Concussion should remove target lock.<br>
3) Invisible to Undead should remove target lock from undead pets. Balanced and fair for clerics/paladins.<br>
4) Taunt skill should force target onto tha taunter. Warriors really need this in group pvp.<br>
5) Mem blurs/Atone should remove target lock.<br>
6) Lull line should remove target lock IF target moves oota tha reduced range.<br>
7) Any target lock should be lost ifn target moves oota range (say 2x spell range to allow for range games). <p>Wulfhere Hausakliufr<BR>

Better either run quickly to zone. /q with your back against the wall if you think you have enough HP/AC to make it.  Or stand in the corner and hope they take mercy on you.<br>
<br>
At this point I would think the only attraction to play a paladin in PvP would be to those who enjoy a futile endeavor.<br>

The 'class balance' changes from RoK onward did not result from a PvP discrepency.  Rogues damage was insanely increased because they were not popular because the 'stealth' nature of their class was of very little use in a world of LGuk camps.<br>
<br>
SO, you now have a world where their stealth abilities ARE very useful.  PLUS they retain a very high toe-to-toe melee status.<br>
<br>
Although I doubt they will happen, Wulf's ideas are very much on the mark of what would be needed for an effective PvP system.<br>

Awhile back Verant implemented some code that lets players hit other players no matter where your body was in the 360 degree arc. I.E. a Warrior could face away from another warrior, turn on autoattack, and hit the other warrior.<br>
<br>
Because of lag, a Rogue could run right through a melee class, and backstab it without turning around. (I.E. Jousting) Is it really a backstab? No. But it works in PvP. (Or so I've heard, never experienced it myself.)<br>
<br>
These new changes bring new prestige to the Rogue. Not sure if I like that or not. <p><IMG SRC="http://jearomjasienta.homestead.com/files/jearompic2.gif" align=left><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=25986">Jearom Jasienta</a><BR><a href="http://www.eq-remnant.com">Remnants of The Tribunal</a><br>There was a soldier, a Scottish soldier<br>Who wandered far away and soldiered far away<br>There was none bolder, with good broad shoulder<br>He's fought in many a fray, and fought and won.<br>He'd seen the glory and told the story<br>Of battles glorious and deeds of goodness<br>But now he's sighing, his heart is crying<br>To leave these green hills of Tyrol.<br>Because these green hills are not highland hills<br>Or the island hills, they're not my land's hills<br>And fair as these green foreign hills may be<br>They are not the hills of home.<br><br><i>"The Green Hills of Tyrol,"</i> traditional Scottish song</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueanaddare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eanaddare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/25/01 9:11:17 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/robin/zander/eq/chara03ett.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin in PvP</span><hr size=1> You can make use of our high dmg weapons in a so call &quot; running duel&quot; situtation.<br>

You approach your target, to a certain distance press attack hotkey. then turn back, run to target again and press again.<br>
In this way, weapon delay become insignificant, dmg owns <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
