We formed when we were all lv5-20.<br>
<br>
I suggest you find a friendly guild that frequents the planes.  I became good friends with TBS.  I went on more TBS raids then most of their members did from July to September.  Attend plane raids whenever you have the chance.  <br>
<br>
This is a great place to learn:<br>
1) How to play at high levels <br>
2) Make friends &lt;or not if your not a nice person&gt; <br>
3) Learn raid organization <br>
4) Get some plane gear<br>
<br>
I suggest the following on raids:<br>
1) Sit back and observe<br>
2) Ask questions to your Group Leader or in your group.  Don't /ooc them, don't ask the raid leader as he/she has enouph going on as it is.  Let your group know this is your first time here &lt;or second&gt; and you might have a lot of questions.<br>
3) Don't ask questions about when your armor mobs are being pulled.  They will come.  Most raiders consider this type of question as bad character even if you meant nothing by it.  Attend 20 or 30+ raids and you will understand this. NEVER send tells to the puller about this, EVER.<br>
4) Enjoy yourself.  Have faith and trust in your raid leader to get you from Point A to Point B and home again as fast and efficient as they know how.<br>
<br>
Resist Gear:  Now is the time to start assembling resist gear.  Up to this point it wasn't neccessary.  Majority of raids will require some type of resist gear.  Assemble Cold and Fire Gear first for Vox and Naggie Raids.  Later work on PR and DR.  Most Uber Mob raids winning or loosing depends on your resist gear.<br>
<br>
Last:  Drop me a line if you have any questions.  We are always looking for new guilds to allie with to expand friendships and raiding opportunities.  I would be happy to try and get your up and comming members on some of our raids.  Or email me, I think it's listed on my profile, contact me in game or visit our web site. <p><b>Redspine Bladeslinger - 56th Myrmidon</b><br>

<br>
Shadowknights, Rangers, Paladins, Druids, Wizards, Necromancers and Monks have their suits drop in Fear.<br>
Rogues, Bards, Warriors, Enchanters, Magicians, Clerics, and Shamans have their suits drop in Hate.<br>
<br>
Each piece in each suit typically combines higher ac than most available items Pre-Kunark along with stat increases, hp / mana increases and resists which total around 50 for the full suit.<br>
<br>
Of course, said planar armor also has a generally original look / tint to it, unless of course you happen to be a monk, or pure int caster.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Phoboplasms in Fear and Haunted Chests in Hate may drop *random* pieces of planar armor for any class when killed, so you never know, you might get lucky.<br>
<br>
Also, Spinechiller Spiders in fear may also drop Cryosilk Armor, this is a holdover from before class planar armor existed, and I believe the only two dropped armors were Indicolite (plate / chain classes) and Cryosilk (pure Int casters).  Cryosilk items can drop for all but jewelry slots, but generally are inferior to either existing items, or the class specific suits.  Oh, and the robe no longer drops.<br>
<br>
There are also various weapons, individual pieces of equipment, wands and assorted miscellaneous items that drop in Fear / Hate for the various classes.  Most of which are decent for the 46-low 50's range, but virtually all pieces are eventually replaced by the average mid to late 50's player.<br>
<br>
Lastly, Iksar cannot wear Rune Etched (shaman), Indicolite (Warrior), Umbral (Shadow Knight) but can wear Blighted (Necromancer) and Shiverback (Monk)<br>
<br>
========================================================================<br>
<br>
Now, to the original poster:<br>
<br>
For the first few raids when you're generally trying to find a guild or two or twenty to raid with, perhaps the best way to be considered, is to offer yourself for raids where your planar armor does NOT drop.<br>
<br>
Raid leaders appreciate Enchanters / Clerics / Bards that help in Fear and Wizards / Druids / Monks that go to hate and will tend to remember this when choosing who will go with them when raiding the other plane.  In a raid group of 24-36 (the standard size of planar raiding parties) you'll typically see 0 - 2 of classes who don't have armor drops in that plane and 2-6 of the classes that do.  <br>
<br>
Remember that when up in the planes, around 20 odd people who don't know you very well, you are making your first impression, and in many cases an impression for your guild as well.  Random druid from guild X who /ooc's every 5 minutes about when will HE get some armor, why he doesn't want Y piece 'cuz it sucks, and who is afk for more than 50% of the raid will leave a strong impression on everyone else that they *really* don't want to be on a raid with people from guild X.<br>
<br>
Getting ready for a planar raid:<br>
<br>
1) Make sure you can actually show up on time or at all even.  If you're not sure, *explicitly state it*, people hate hate hate no shows.<br>
(It however does happen to all of us, for instance, last night I was supposed to be in Hate, got delayed in a meeting and was 15 minutes late, in which time, the raid leader had replaced me, I sent him a tell wishing him and his raid the best of luck).<br>
2) Make sure that you have at least 10 hours free from the start of the raid.  Yes some will say &quot;I'm l337, we clear the plane in 5 hours every time&quot;, but generally, unless you're on specific Very experienced raider guilds, the average length of a raid will fall between 7 and 10 hours.<br>
3) Leaving after your armor mobs have been killed but before other's have is lame, lame lame lame lame lame.<br>
4) Resist gear is very important for Nagafen / Vox, and variour other encounters, for the Planes however, it's much less important, other than to perhaps bump up your magic resistance a bit.  <br>

<br>
This will be your best armor until you get something better in Kunark (or SoV now I assume) and you end up banking that planar armor forever. (Unless it has resists, see below.)<br>
<br>
On dragon raids, where their spells will kill you faster than anything, and you'll die by touch regardless of your AC, you'll see people in Split Paw Hide Tunics because resistances are everything.<br>
<br>
Eventually, you'll be carrying around 3 backpacks full of crappy gear with great resists on it &quot;just for that special occasion&quot;. <p><P><table width="0" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">

so if you aren't worried about stats and/or Hps/mana, and were only concerning youraself with AC, then why would you go to the planes concerning yourself for loot, when you could just go to kunark and get better AC?<br>
<br>
Personally, I want to go to planes for the whole &quot;mob&quot; feeling (having a bunch of people in one place hanging out), and get the plane items that have more int then what I have now for whatever slot, which is I believe, like 2 or 3 of em? haha, all I do is feed mana anyway, screw AC. <br>

But for the most part it's for god/dragon lvl fights. For normal things that flux you don't go quite as all out, you still want to keep your ac/stats up. With a god/dragon it's not like he's going to miss you regardless of what your ac is so just have resists up for the ae effects. <p><A HREF="mailto:Hethral@telus.net"><IMG SRC="http://the.truthbringers.com/images/friends/hethralkrbanner1.jpg" BORDER="0"></A><BR>

While you can't wear either as an Iksar, you can still appreciate the upgrade that you recieve from the planar armor.<br>
<br>
In general:<br>
-planar has more AC than sol ro quest armor, and other comparable pre kunark non quested armor<br>
-planar has more stat bonuses on it than other non planar, pre kunark non quested armor.  instead of getting, say, 5str from an item that's quested, you'll get 7str and some other stat as well.  this is more common for the tank classes, like warriors, though<br>
-planar has resist built into the pieces as well.  The resist might not be all that great for each piece, but it's a nice add-on<br>
<br>
For Iksar specificly:<br>
-Plane of Growth is a godsend in terms of armor upgrades<br>
-PoG armor is marginally lower AC than the kunark class armor, but has great stats and resists on them.<br>
