His naked skin tingled in anticipation of the ritual he was about to begin.  He had created this rite himself when he was inducted into the Lodge of the Dead as a Knight of Shadow.  Thirty-nine times he had performed it, and each time the words and thought flowed more naturally than the last.  Only this time his heart raced faster than it had the first time, or the twentieth, when he first bore his House name.<br>
<br>
Reaching forward he lit the incense within the blackened silver brazier at the center of the crimson silk altar cloth.  The flame flared to ruddy life, symbolizing the hatred that was the Father’s Gift.  The heady aroma filled Khasirath’s lungs like blood on the battlefield.  The flickering radiance played over his indigo and crimson skin in a tantalizing interplay of shadow and light.  Breathing in deeply he intoned, “May Your Hatred always burn within me.”<br>
<br>
He picked up a specially ensorcelled flask that was sitting beside him.  Opening it he poured the thick red liquid into the minotaur-horn drinking vessel behind the brazier.  “The blood of the Heretics I reap for You, my Lord.  Your Will spreads across the lands.  Those who will not kneel before You in life will serve You in Death.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath placed his left hand upon the blackened femur that was scribed with Elder Teir’Dal runes.  His right hand rested on the sacrificial blade with its ebony handle.  Staring deeply into the brazier that sat between them he spoke again, his rasping voice resonating within the stone-walled room, “I am the vessel of Your Will.  I am here for one Purpose only – to walk the Path You have created for me.  Use me well, for I am Yours.”<br>
<br>
He continued to gaze into the flame as he knelt silently with his hands upon his thighs, his breath slow and deep as he meditated, reciting sacred mantras within his thoughts as his mind centered on the hatred within.  Deeper his mind sank; growing stiller as his hatred rose, cleansing his thoughts.  His eyes rolled back as they slowly closed and his breathing seemed to stop for a long moment as hatred filled him completely, eclipsing everything else.  A fine sheen of sweat formed over his body with the discipline of holding that power without release.<br>
<br>
His violet eyes smoldered red from within as they opened once more, meeting the Eye of Innoruuk runelight that was suspended in the small window above his altar.  Smoothly he stood and took down the crossed sword and staff from their place on the wall below the window.  He laid the staff across the front edge of the altar-table and held the sword point-down before him.  “I am Teir’Dal.  My will is the Will of Innoruuk.  We shall unmake the world.”  Raising the ebony-hilted sword with both hands close to his chest, the flat of the blade before his face, he continued, “I am born Shadow Knight.  My sword is the Sword of Innoruuk.  The Mouth of Innoruuk shall not be closed.”  He spun the sword in a tight arc over his shoulder before returning it to its bracket on the wall.<br>
<br>
Kneeling back down before the altar he picked up a long fang by the sinew cord that was bound around it.  Carefully he tied it onto the rune carved treantwood staff, running his hand over the many different tokens of his hunting through the years.  “This fang from the great Kobold King who served the Dragon Nagafen bears witness to my strength, Dark Father. The test of Your Fortieth Gate of Hatred I have passed.”<br>
<br>
Standing, he hung the staff back on the wall, and then returned to his kneeling position.  He swept his braided hair forward over his shoulder, the moon-white length of it almost reaching his navel.  Bowing his head he quieted himself, drawing his hate into every fiber of his being as he prepared for the next part of the ritual.  Deep within himself he could feel the connection to Innoruuk’s Divine Hatred.  He sensed his God’s presence inside his mind.<br>
<br>
Leaning forward he lifted the minotaur-horn vessel with both hands, reveling in the heat of the brazier against his forearms.  He raised the horn to his lips and drank deeply, savoring the rich taste of the warmed blood.  Returning the horn to its silver stand he bowed his head again.<br>
<br>
The time had come to add the mark of the Fortieth Gate to his body.  At each ritual he had done this, and almost two-thirds of his flesh now bore the blood-red designs and runes.  In his youth he would research the images at the Spires of Innoruuk, but as he grew stronger in the Will they had come to him in his dreams.  His chest and arms were covered with these tattoo-like sigils, as well as some parts of his shoulders and back.<br>
<br>
Softly chanting a mantra in the Elder Teir’Dal tongue Khasirath drew the power of Innoruuk’s Touch into his hands, watching as the black aura crackled and writhed over his fingers, lapping hungrily up his wrists.  The sweat beaded upon his indigo and crimson skin as he brought his hands close to his lower back, holding in his mind the image he had chosen.<br>
<br>
The flow of time suddenly froze, the flickering flame in the brazier stilling as darkness stole Khasirath’s sight.  Panic would have gripped his heart but for the sudden unearthly chuckle within his mind.  The Father’s own Hatred crashed into him in waves as he looked up at his God.  He knelt before Innoruuk’s Throne, in exactly the same position he had in his rooms.  But now the dark spiritual armour he had earned in this Realm protected his naked soul.  He knew his mortal shell would be kneeling still before his altar, silent as death.<br>
<br>
Khasirath rose to his feet before Innoruuk and clasped his fist over his heart in salute.  Innoruuk loomed over His servant, a hideous sneer of satisfaction and sadistic delight upon His lips.  Alien emotions razed through Khasirath’s mind, the raw feelings of the God of Hate.  Were he not His servant, he surely would have been driven mad.  But this was far from the first time Khasirath had stood before his Lord.  Each time his mortal shell was slain, Innoruuk would bring him here to be judged and punished for his failure before being returned to Norrath.<br>
<br>
Normally during these punishments, the God would say nothing to His creation, meting out discipline at His inscrutable whim.  But this was a rare and different occasion.  He had brought His Knight here in a moment of triumph, not defeat.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk’s voice rang within Khasirath’s very soul, echoing with the oaths of the damned and the exultations of the Chosen, “Khasirath S`Therik, you have served Me quite well in Norrath through Forty Gates of My Will.  With this test complete you are now prepared to serve Me in even greater capacities.  It brings Me great satisfaction to see the Hatred wielded by the Violent Harvest in My Name.  Your mark for this Gate you shall display for all of the creatures of Norrath to see My Hand upon you, and My Will within you.”<br>
<br>
Innoruuk reached His Hand forward and brushed one huge fingertip between Khasirath’s eyes and down the bridge of his nose.  The pain was exquisite, rolling on and on as the God’s Hate seared a rune into the Knight’s soul.  Unable to flinch or even cry out, Khasirath’s mind was filled with Innoruuk’s perverse pleasure and pride.  With no other release his thoughts filled with a primal scream, instinctively trying to preserve his sanity by driving the agony and the alien presence away.<br>
<br>
When Innoruuk finally withdrew His hand, Khasirath swore he could smell his own burning flesh.  The pain had been far keener than when he used the Father’s Touch on himself, but as it was his soul and not his body that was hurt, he could not recover in the same way.  Though he did not need to breathe, Khasirath found himself panting as he looked up at his God.<br>
<br>
The low and dangerous chuckle filled his mind again, “Good, my slave.  Remember well that Touch, and know it for the gift it is.  And now one last gift before I return you to Norrath -- release My Power through your hands.”<br>
<br>
With the divine Hate still screaming through his soul, Khasirath raised his hands and released the Father’s Touch into the ether without hesitation.  The black aura shot out, twining and writhing as it coalesced into the blue-black blade of a large ornate saber.  The cup hilt continued to writhe around his hand with disconcerting sentience.<br>
<br>
“Like the armour you wear, this blade can only serve you when I summon you here to do My Will, Khasirath.  You are now one of my greater slaves, a true Knight of My Will.  Return now to Norrath and continue My work.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath raised his fist to his heart, clenching his new blade tightly.  As he saluted Innoruuk he also bowed his head to show his acceptance of His Will.<br>
<br>
When he opened his eyes he found himself kneeling before his altar once more, his ears still ringing from the God’s laughter.  Looking down at his hands he could see that the aura of the Father’s Touch had dissipated, expended for the day in Innoruuk’s own Realm.  His entire body ached with the pain of the Dark Father’s branding of his soul.  Leaning forward he snuffed out the brazier’s flame with a muttered prayer of gratitude.<br>
<br>
As Khasirath stood unsteadily the ringing in his ears grew.  But the physical and mental discomfort could not quell the pride and glory he felt.  He had grown stronger than he had ever dared to dream, and he had garnered the favor of the Father.  Curiously he walked to his mirror and looked at his face.  There between his brows and down his nose was the new and startling crimson sigil.  It hinted at a sword, the point at the tip of his nose as the crossguards brushed against his arched white brows.  The hilt extended a little ways up his forehead.  The arched lines of the sigil brought to mind thorns and fangs.  A wolfish grin spread over Khasirath’s face as he studied this mark.<br>
<br>
A new era had begun for the Thresher, a new age of power and influence.  Many heretics whispered his name in fear and the young of Neriak often recognized him on sight.  The Harvest grew greater by the day under the guidance of the Triad.  Soon the Father’s dark day would dawn and the Harvest would sweep across the lands to Cull the Chosen from the chaff.  And Khasirath S`Therik, a Knight of the Will would be prepared.<br>
