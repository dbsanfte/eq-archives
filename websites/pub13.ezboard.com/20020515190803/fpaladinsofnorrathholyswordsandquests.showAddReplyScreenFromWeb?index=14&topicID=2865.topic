of Ro quest gave me a purpose from my upper 20s to about 35, took too long I know. But at your lvl everytime u turn in a quest item to the Paladins in Rathe mountains the xp is insane. If I remember correctly it was more than a yellow buble each time, I was around lvl 30. Dont listen to the nay sayers, Ro is a great amour; the quests enphasize that we are Paladins: the ones that take the road less traveled by, the hardest path. The rewards in this case are worth the pain. This armour will serve you well trust me. <br>

Bracers its iffy, personally I wear a Hero and a Ry`Gorr Chain Bracer.<br>

Im still wearing my Ro Greaves and Boots at L49.. <br>

I spent L32 to 45 doing my Ro quests..hell I got my Soulfire before i finished my Ro <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
The one part i never did was the Vambraces, i got spoilt by my guild and was given DW Vambraces to replace my bronze ones at L42.. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the point is that I wanted to do the Ro Quests as I wanted to prove to myself atleast that I could do it, because it is a Paladin Quest.And even though there is better armour out there , the sense of accomplishment is a cool feeling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Even though I had a EB BP, Hero Bracer,DW helm , I still did the quests to gain faction, a little xp and i am stubborn, I wanted to have a complete set of Ro!! ( hehe, I still dont, never did the Vambrace mold quest) .<br>

At 40 (does the Exp Bar Stop at 40??) I decided to put my stashed pieces or the quest to work.  I was on an MM raid with friends and a Paladin asked if I did my Ro Quest.  We had already taken out the Cooks.  I didn't even know what the were for but he instructed me to take them and I did.  Had a Sands of Ro for like 30 levels and I was ready to see what the quest was really like.  <br>
<br>
My Lovely Cleric, Opalie, and I set off for Melatite.  Hmmm...   now Where does it drop ???   Wound up frustrated and deep in the caverns there, to find the area camped.  Wound up taking to the people and met new friends.  Went away with 5 Melatites and new folks on the friends list.  Did the Bone Chip thing.  Met a few Good people in the Elven town.  Opalie even sold the CCS off her back to someone who simply wanted it.  Again, met new friends.<br>
Ran around Lava, only been there a couple of brief times before.  ReDiscovered the meaning of Lost a few times.  Winced everytime I slay a cute little Fairy.  Met a Happy and helpful Enchanter to do the Plat Bars.  Crossed Fingers Twice hitting the COMBINE BUTTON.  Joked with a few people in OOC and Tells.  Met a few other Paladins and swapped Inspec's.  <br>
<br>
I know this is an old Subject by board standards...but ...We had a Good Time in General doing the Quest.  People seem to want to help on quests like this, not that we begged anyone.  My Cleric and I roamed Norrath and ported through Luclin, paid Druids and ran long slow runs for the armor.  It was interesting.  Such a relief from watching the Exp Bar.<br>
<br>
It was fun and yeah...brings you to places you normally would not go to.   I can't hang out in the same zone for 8 levels, drives me nuts and you never know who else is out there to share a laugh or tense moment with.<br>
<br>
Pain in the Butt...yeah...worth it?   I dunno...  Questing more Ro?  Dunno...my Cleric has her eye on a Cool Shield Quest )  I'm busy for a little while )) <br>

It took me one 4 day weekend of nearly constant playing and long....boring waits and a great deal of help from a friend of mine (52 ranger) but I did it. I went around with my ranger friend and collected all the pieces for ronium with other guildies who were already camping the zones and the ronium (contrary to the norm I hear) went very smoothly, although I dumped a nice sum of 1200p into the plat bars for the armor. After that, I went to the various zones as mentioned on the wonderful faq in the Tombs of Knowledge section and yelled &quot;hiring a tracker to help me kill so and so.&quot; I was lucky enough to always get one and generally all mobs dropped what I needed the first time. I had to raid MM with my guild to get the cauldron's (was a pain) but on the upside I was lucky enough to zone in just as someone killed the Nightfall Giant (WOOOT) and got his head w/o even a wait (lucky me). I then, after 100s of plat spent on bone chips and tireless hours of working on faction, made my suit of Ro. It looks totally badass and stats arent bad at all for 30 range. Sure, I had armor on par and maybe even better before, but it was SOOOOOO ugly. Anyways, to make a long story short, armor of Ro rocks. It was long and tedious and expensive, but the faction is a MUST later on in the game and it did indeed help me get through the not-so-wonderful lvl 30. As luck would have it, I have already replaced 3 pieces of Ro with deepwater but I still am keeping the Ro for role-playing and bad-ass looking purposes (since I'm NEVER gonna get that DW BP! hehe) Good Luck to you on your quest. It's a blast <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umerts.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merts</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/1/02 6:09:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2865.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Armor of Ro Story</span><hr size=1> I did a full suit of Ro armor minus the vambraces (arms).  (For which i had Fine Plate vambraces)<br>
<br>
These quests are pretty fun, and really do keep you pushing forward to get that next piece.  The Armor is pretty good and the AC is better than fine plate.  Maybe by only 1-2 AC, but it is better none the less.  Not to mention that you get resists and stats on some pieces.  <br>
<br>
The look is also very nice, i can't tell you how many comment's i got in my 30's after i had the full suit, about how cool i looked.  It really starts pointing you in the direction of a ture Paladin, and you get to visit many zones and make many new friends.  I met one of my best friends to this day because of Ro armor quests.  (Trying to get those cauldrons in mistmoore kitchen)<br>
<br>
The factions you build from it become very useful later on.  And after you do these quests you will be one of the most liked people in all of norrath.  (From an NPC perspective)  <br>
<br>
The only reason i didn't get the vambraces (and believe me i tried, i tried a LOT) is because of those stupid plague sharks.  I even brought a tracker a few times, only to see them pop up on track, only to depop 1-2 minutes later.  Some people get lucky with the vambraces and get the sharks early on.<br>
<br>
In any case, the armor quests are pretty fun to do, and really give you a sense of direction and purpose from 20's-30's.  And the armor will last into mid 40's, until you start making a bit of money, or finding some good upgrades.<br>
