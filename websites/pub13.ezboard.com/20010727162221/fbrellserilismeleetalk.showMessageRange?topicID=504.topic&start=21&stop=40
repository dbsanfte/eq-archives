<br>
-You're not a cleric, why expect to heal as good or as effeciently as one?<br>
-You're not a warrior, why expect to tank as good as a warrior?<br>
-You're not an enchanter, don't even think you'll ever get as close to the crowd control ability of one.<br>
-You're not a wizard, don't expect to put out the damage of one (even though I will admit that wizards need an adjustment for damage right now.)<br>
<br>
You ARE a utility class...now let me go on to say that's not a dirty word...druids, shamans, and yes, even rangers are utility classes, all based off of their parent classes.<br>
<br>
Druids heal and nuke, they have qualities from a wizard and a cleric, though not as good as a damage output of a wizard or the effeciency or healing power of a cleric.<br>
<br>
Rangers can damage output with the best of the tank classes, if they agro the mob though they might as well bend over and take it up the butt, because there's nothing in a high level dungeon that's going to save them from dying.  They don't have the hitpoints of a tank, they have no where near the AC the tank can have, sure they could heal...oh wait, they are busy taking damage and dying.<br>
<br>
Shaman, they have augmentation powers like an enchanter for the group, they can slow mobs like an enchanter, they can heal using the same powers as a druid that they draw from a cleric but also do not have the healing power or effiiciently of a cleric.<br>
<br>
Paladins, let's take a look at the class a bit.  <br>
-Lay on Hands.  You are the only class that can save a party member or turn the tide of a battle with one button click, no one else can come close to a power like this, no one, not even a cleric because this power requires absolutely no mana.<br>
-Ressurection.  You are the only hybrid class to have this ability at all.  Druids do not even get this ability, Rangers, a hybrid class themselves do not even get close to this ability.<br>
<br>
If you want to cry about your class, be fair to others, tell us how rangers have a poor ac and are not loved by clerics because they take so many hits that they suck to heal.  Be fair and tell us how Shaman got screwed with their dots after 50.  Be fair and tell us how Clerics lost their luster when they started to rez and every single person on the server sends them tells or drags their corpses in front of the clerics for a rez.  Tell us how fair it is in general when tanks get out of a zone because it's one way.<br>
<br>
I'm not here to tell you you are wrong, but you have grossly misjudged your paladin's abilities and have decided that everyone else is better than you.  When you've done this you might as well just give up the class and start another or just quit.  I do not see you're side of the arguement here, all classes have weaknesses and all classes have strengths. <p>Dauros 58th Enchanter of Ethos<BR>

The only time I am lfg for a period of time is when I am tired and don't feel like forming one.  There is no reason to sit lfg for 4 or 5 hours and do nothing if your there more than 20 and noone ask for you just start forming one works almost every time.<br>
<br>
Heck if form raids like that.<br>
<br>
I did invite you to a group one time and I have to say you were a bit harsh on your group mates and left after a short time but may have been having a hard day and we all do.  Despite that I will likely give you another chance sometime if I am forming a group.<br>
<br>
Consider carefully they way you treat people though and consider your words even more carefully like a sword words are weapons and can you cut far deeply than the sharpest blade.  As you well know.<br>

Paladins have it no different than others imo.  It makes perfect sense that my light, agile, duel wielding, banded wearing ranger doesn't dodge or parry nearly as well as a full plate wearing paladin or sk.  On a less sarcastic note I think paladins damage is respectable and often underestimanted.  Better dmg/dly weapons are readily available and Fenye has one of the more powerfull swords in the game.  Do paladins need some fixing, yes, but only as much as every other class in the game.  <br>
Oh, and Fenye, paladins were never extraodinarily powerfull, your head was just extraordinarily big :P<br>

<br>
Defense caps roughly equal to a Warrior (same for SK's)<br>
<br>
Offense inferior to a warrior (same as a SK)<br>
<br>
Other things a Warrior can't do: Heals (which may not be useful in fights, but severely speed up downtime outside of fights), Stuns (aside from a few unstunnable opponents, these are worth their weight in gold), Buffs (yes, the Clerics ARE better.... but can the Cleric afford to buff every single party member every buff cycle (and if they are, how much downtime is that inducing?).<br>
<br>
We have a Rogue that runs a damage parser most nights and posts results.  I'm content with where I sit.  The Monk and Rogue make mincemeat of things... but I dish out a good whack or two... and more importantly, I pay attention to how many hits and how much damage the party takes.  Most nights the other five people don't even add up to the number of times I'm hit or damage taken... and my average damage taken is pretty low all things considered.<br>
<br>
A warrior <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> replace me in a fight and would generally do more than I can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> in that fight</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  OTOH, once the fight is over, I can better prepare us to get to the next fight faster... and downtime is Norrath's greatest evil.<br>
<br>
A Shadowknight <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> outtaunt me and outdamage me... but again, when that fight is over, I bring the team to the next fight faster.<br>
<br>
I could stand at a zoneline looking for a group... or I could begin using the Invite button and building a group... a practice I began a long time ago and haven't lacked for teammates ever since.  I can understand how frustrating this must feel for people (having to wait for any amount of time for someone to ask me to group with thme), but I don't understand why so many people do it willingly.<br>
<br>
Paladins had a very valid complaint about their stats nearly 17 months ago when our defense caps were lower, but right now we balance out with Warriors by gaining spells for the sacrifice of offense.  It's a fair trade all told, whether its a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> good<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  trade is up to you to determine.<br>
<br>
There's an aweful lot the 'utility' classes can add to an equation to make them the right class to have along... I can promise you that if YOU control the party (by being the person forming things), you've got a better chance of finding a party mix that CAN use your talents well... pickup gaming is a crapshoot at best... in many w</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhwed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hwed</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://conard.net/pictures/lildorf.jpg height=25 width=25 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/22/01 10:26:12 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://conard.net/pictures/lildorf.jpg height=99 width=98></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> Nico, would you mind posting a link to the parsed data you speak of?

Also, has your guildmate ever considered parsing a comparison of damage dealt by a mob normally compared to a mob chain stunned by a Paladin?  That would be interesting to see.<br>

However, there is little that a warrior can do to help me out.  Actually, there is nothing a warrior can do to help me out.  Paladins are able to take hits at the same rate a warrior can, they can help me buff when mana is low, they have Lay Hands (which has saved someones arse more than I can remember), they can provide backup heals... the list goes on.<br>
<br>
Fenye, hon.. I understand what you are saying, but I can honestly say that the two tank classes I would rather group with over any others are Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights.  These three tank classes can take the damage very nicely and as a cleric that's more mana efficient for me.<br>
<br>
There is definitely a positive side to your class!!<br>
<br>
Besides, I get to listen to the complaints from a high level Warrior once in awhile.  He reminds me, each time we get into this conversation, how unbalanced Warriors really are and all the advantages that Paladins have over Warriors.  /hugs Talurok<br>

He's got something built now that helps him with parsing the text file now.  Keep in mind that this particular night I was pulling, so a good bit of damage I was taking wasn't recorded... being out of range of his text logs)<br>

The party in this log is <br>

Wippin was a ways behind in level at this time (10 levels below me) as was Sisle.  The other party members are withing two levels of each other.

Far as I can see ALL classes suck big time the higher level they get(in relation to what stuff can be killed).<br>
Personally I think Paladin is a good class.Id chose a Paladin over a ranger or SK with maybe the only exception being if the group needed a snarer.<br>
As for you not being able to taunt off rangers in a fight lol I think the only melee class that can do easily is a rogue(heh and obviously the dont even intend to do so).<br>
A while ago Brad something like &quot;the only class the seems happy is the Enc&quot; and I think he was pretty correct for once. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicophorus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicophorus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Less Talk, More Fight</span><br>  Posts: 810<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/22/01 11:01:46 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Another Log</span><hr size=1> Start:   Sun May 20 20:36:41 2001<br>

<br>
(my notes) this is a recent log run by Wippin.  I'd just got back from LA and was examining my inner eyelids while Skippin went out with a guild group and some friends.<br>
<br>
The groups consists of<br>
--- tanks---<br>
Veldan (HE Paladin)<br>
Belsten (GN Warrior)<br>
Nazak (TR Warrior)<br>
Charlam (WE Ranger)<br>
<br>
--- killers ---<br>
Wippin (HF Rogue)<br>
Vjescji (HM Monk)<br>
<br>
--- Healers ---<br>
Skippin (HF Druid)<br>
Hethral (DF Cleric)<br>
<br>
Belsten and Nazak are well out of level range for this group, but Charlam equals Veldan in level and is moderately lower in equipment (Charlam not using a haste item while Veldan is) while Vj exceeds in both level and equipment.<br>
<br>
Over a 2.5 hour window Veldan is attacked significantly more often than the other party members, generally for less damage WHILE still dealing a fair percentage of the total damage.  Most importantly, consider that WITHOUT an Enchanter the Cleric and Druid were hit a combined 35 times in 150 minutes.  Wippin, the Rogue is hit 17 times in the same period (or roughly one attack every 9 minutes).<br>
<br>
Mielage will vary, but I've tried to show how two teams FAR from the 'appropriate' mix can function, gain XP, items, and have fun in a short session of EQ.  Oh... and that Paladins don't completely suck! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think the well played Paladin is a very valid class.<br>
<br>
I've been teaming with Kreon alot more these days and I must say I think he has it pretty close to how a Paladin can put his full abiltities to good use.<br>
<br>
First off here are what I see that Kreon does that I feel add MAJOR value to my team.<br>
<br>
Stun control - Paladins can use stuns for a number of things. First is to stop a mob from completing a spell. Second they can decrease the melee efficiance of a mob and the same time building agro which gives the chanter/shaman time to slow the mob and not get agro. Thirdly it can buy the chanter time to mez a mob that might have otherwise interrupted the chanter.<br>
<br>
Root Control - Paladins do have Root and an upgrade or two. This is very handy for large pulls and for breaking mez. *Root is by far the quickest way to break mez that I know of.* For this reason in certain situations Paladins make an excellent choice for a primary assist. Trak, Fear and DN come to mind.<br>
<br>
Downtime Healing - As mentioned before Paladins are prefect for doing downtime heals. This reduces the drain on my cleric and thus allows me to pull quicker and in turn more often.<br>
<br>
Buffing - Paladins can again save lives and downtime here. They might not have the best buffs but the weaker symbol is perfect for buffing casting and none tanking classes. Paladin symbol + Divine Glory/Strength is almost the same as a normal symbol. And since I typically don't have a lvl 58 cleric with me this saves us alot of downtime in a situation where the casters might need more health.<br>
<br>
Tanking - I am the primary tank in most of my teams. Since I also do alot of the pull this can sometimes be a major disadvantage when you leave your casters alone without someone that can handle a supprise threat. I don't fear this with Kreon in my team. I think paladin that tank and chain cast stun between swings are going to find out that in a pinch they can tank as well as even a warrior(at the cost of mana depletion and melee damage output).<br>
<br>
I have however teamed with paladins that do none of this. And yes, they are absolutely and completely worthless in a group for the most part. Especially in some of the more advanced encounters where you need everyone giving their best in order to survive the day.<br>
<br>
Oh, one more thing about Lay on Hands. THIS ROCKS. How many times have you been in a team where all of a sudden something jumps your cleric or chanter and beats them down in about 5-10 seconds. It might not sound like much but LOH just doubled the time you have to remedy the situation. That is if the paladin is paying attention. I think we all know how much time you lose when you cleric dies deep in Seb or DN(Ugggghhhhh!). LOH just saved you 20-30min of downtime getting him back or evacing and getting him rez'd.<br>
<br>
But thats just my opinion...<br>

If not, no big deal!<br>
<br>
Hmm, didn't mean to pop off this ramble, it just sort of came out...  <br>
<br>
Any Paladin that can't taunt off of a ranger, monk, rogue, or anyone else is doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
Stuns are a tremendous taunt.  Not only do they infuriate mobs, but they keep the mob from hitting the more fragile folk for a few second while the paladin slashes, bashes, taunts, disarms, and stuns again.  And again.  And again.<br>
<br>
A well-played Paladin is the greatest taunter in this game.  We have so many tools available, not only for getting a mob's attention, but for preventing that mob from dealing damage at all.<br>
<br>
Warriors mitigate damage by absorbing it (taking the hits).<br>
<br>
Paladins mitigate damage by preventing it (stunning the living daylights out of a mob so that it can't move).<br>
<br>
Which is more mana efficient for a cleric?  I would contend that, if you put a level 60 Paladin and a level 60 warrior up against two identical mobs (say, some random level 54 mushroom man in Seb), the Paladin (properly played) will outlast the warrior before needing a heal.  <br>
<br>
Sure, that CHeal might only heal 3500 HP instead of 5000, but you might also be looking at 1 CHeal per minute on the Paladin vs. 2 per minute on the warrior.  While the warrior takes the hits, the Paladin simply avoids letting those hits ever land.<br>
<br>
(Furthermore, a Paladin with Clarity 2 and a Deepwater Bracer can keep chainstunning regular pulls almost indefinitely)<br>
<br>
And let's not even talk about gaters and mobs that heal.  Warriors can't do too much there.<br>
<br>
Ooh!  And I almost forgot about our &quot;Save Your Ass&quot; line!<br>
<br>
Divine Favor: Rune-like spell, almost instant casting time.  Emergency damage-prevention shield.  Makes the target invulnerable for quite a few hits, just long enough for the healer to take care of 'em.  <br>
<br>
Wave of Healing: A weak group heal, 200 hp per person, but another very short casting time that can come in handy when the whole group's getting smacked down and the chanter's still getting things under control.<br>
<br>
Lay Hands: You know about this one.  The Get Out of Jail Free card.  This is always ready to go on the chanter or cleric.  If you're getting beat down and a heal doesn't seem forthcoming, get in range of the Paladin, he SHOULD be hammering on this button with you targeted.  Also a very nice taunt.  =)<br>
<br>
Divine Aura: Self only, but it saves SOMEONE's ass.  If the cleric's are all dead and you need someone camped for rez and CR, 20 seconds of invulnerability, the bottom spot on the hate list, and a /q may get your Paladin out in time.  He can probably absorb the extra 10 seconds of hits he'll take when it wears off.<br>
<br>
Divine Glory &amp; Divine Strength: Don't be lazy, folks!  Use these spells on your casters, at least.  Never know when 100 or 200 HP will make a difference between life and death.  Even some tanks prefer 'em over the ranger buff. (Rangers tend to throw a tantrum if you put this on them though.)<br>
<br>
Paladins: More Save Your Ass Tools than You Can Shake a Stick At! <br>

I used to be such an avid supporter of Paladins.. but I am just too depressed about them now. I sit at sebilis for hours, and sometimes wouldn't find a group in DAYS. I am not lying. I have been leveling so slowly, my friends pass me up. They are out there winning all sorts of really nice equipment, gaining levels 10 times as fast as I am, all the while I'm sitting at the zone LFG.<br>
<br>
Hm, try LFG 20 hours in two days as I did a couple weeks ago.  I'm LFG probably 70% of my time online.  During that time, I soloed forager/hunter in TT, killed lots of coldain in GD, visited friends across Norrath.  If you want to find a group, don't sit in Sebilis unless you require the comfort of rotting frogloks.  Here are other places you could be going for decent experience at your level:<br>
<br>
Chardok<br>
Howling Stones<br>
Wakening Lands (sentient suits of armor, easy with partner)<br>
Skyshrine/Kael/Cobalt Scar/Dragon Necropolis/Icewell (depending on faction, but should be no problem with one group around your level)<br>
Hole<br>
and I'm sure there are a few other places I forgot to list.<br>
<br>
As far as equipment goes, I would suggest investing in some cheap jewelry to improve certain stats.   If you're going to tank, use AC gear, if you're not the tank of your group, wear some str/dex equipment and a haste item.<br>
<br>
If you're still disillusioned over being a paladin, talk to Walrus, he seems to have quite a bit of pride in his class. <p><B>
