Rampage list is 4 people. Normally there are tanks filling the role so clerics don't get on the rampage list. You are not expected to heal rampage tanks (if you are, your guild needs better leadership). Ripostes should not happen...all melee should be behind the mob, with MT in front. If you wish to push mob the other direction, MT rotates sides and all melee are still behind the mob. Where are you getting riposted from? If your tanks are taking riposte damage, THEY are doing something wrong. If your casters are nuking and getting aggro, they are nuking too early, tell them to chill out. If a rogue misses evade, it's gonna be a couple seconds before that mob gets back on the tank..leading to 2 possible outcomes. 1) rogue dies. 2) mob turns back, rogue is not taking anymore damage, therefore the rate you heal him at is inconsequential. Don't tell me I don't know what i'm talking about when it's quite obvious that you don't.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Whether you understand it or not, the bottom line is people take damage on raids, whether they're maintank or not.  As of right now, clerics are primarily relied upon to do ALL healing, and druids function as a tertiary healer.  Druids would love to function as backup healers on these raids and in these situations...we currently are not effective in this right.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
Druids get damage shields, which are also insanely useful spells...however their usefulness decreases as levels progress. Slows start off as a relatively useless spell and progress to very powerful. It's a give and take. <br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You're right, the fact that my 4 point damage shield at level 5 was so grossly overpowered means that I should suffer at level 60.  You forget, damage shields haven't really been 'insanely useful' in a very long time.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hmm, you want a 24 second heal over time, for 250 mana that heals 900 with no recast time. Torpor is a heal for 24 seconds for 200 mana that heals 1200, but also has a snare and slow component. You're right, they bear no resemblance at all. In fact, i can't believe i ever confused them with each other. /sarcasm off.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeah, far be it for druids to ask for something useful.  How dare we!<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
There is no flaw in this logic. There is a pyramid of priest classes. It has Clerics on top..obviously superior. They get the best heal in the game, and then they get 2 other heals, which are superior to other priest heals. On the next ring of the pyramid is the 2 utility priest classes...Shaman, and Druids. Shaman got one of the cleric heals, druids got the other.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Yeah, and I never said Divine light was all that great either, ask clerics, they're not satisfied with it.  CE is fine because when you use ce, you expect it to take time.  Divine light is a pretty crappy heal, you can ask most any cleric.  I'm all in favor of an upgrade to DL, I think this is the druid petition tho, so it's off topic.<br>

Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
Actually, necros that have their epic, love their epic. Manafree damage keeps the XP rolling. i also see many druids making use of their epic by root/rotting 4 mobs at a time, due to the manafree damage and snare their epic provides. Please, enlighten me...what mobs do you wish to engage, on an encounter where snare makes a goddamned difference, that you are not able to take? That Bulthar Herdleader giving you problems? Do you have issues with not being able to snare the Avatar of War and he runs and trains more giants on your raid? Again, i'm boggling here because you're failing to make valid points.<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok you COMPLETELY miss the point.  The point is not that we want to snare stuff we shouldn't, the point is we want our epic to land on mobs that are unsnarable.  How is this a hard concept? the mobs who are not snarable are immune to our epic.  We would like to still use this dot on these mobs.  Simple yes?<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Since it's damage is so meager, why would you wish to occupy one of the 15 buff slots mobs have with this POS dot? Am I missing something? Surely there are more efficient things to waste a buff slot of a mob on...especially in this day and age when people are getting &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; more and more often.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Exactly our point.  We want it to do significant amounts of damage, such that it is worth casting.  Thank you for proving my point.<br>
<br>

Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
I've explained it so many times I can't understand how you could have missed it. You're not getting CH, period. Ever. Even group CH, so just forget about it. Then you want a better group heal and a better single target heal than the best cleric heals in each department. Raids revolve around CH, you are asking to be a better healer than a cleric in XP groups...and you keep denying it.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Oh, you're right, Druid_uber_divine_light_upgrade will make us better than clerics at healing in an exp group...yeah cause, CH is never used in exp groups...yeah that's it.  Common, you can't take yourself seriously....<br>

-------------------------------------------------------Need I remind you that your 60 heal drops off a vendor?<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeah, Again, we do not feel that Natures Touch is a viable heal.  It is the same (infact slightly less efficient) as chloroblast.  So yes, our insufficient heal drops off a vendor, where as torpor drops off of high level mobs.  So?<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------Actually, I am not incorrect, because it has happened. Natures touch is a faster heal than chlorblast in terms of total time to heal. You can heal 880 faster with natures touch than you can with chloroblast, therefore keeping up with mob damage on any mob that hits for more than ~220 or so. Trust me, I can drop Captain Bvellos or Yeldema with a druid healing with natures touch, but they can't keep up with chloroblast.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Heh, oooh Bvellos you say? whoa...<br>
Seriously, I'm talking about endgame stuff, or at least real mobs.  To get into numbers...<br>
<br>
Chloroblast <br>
385 hps<br>
175 mana<br>
2.2 ratio<br>
3.0 sec cast time<br>
<br>
NT<br>
880 hps<br>
400 mana<br>
2.2 ratio<br>
5.5 sec cast time<br>
<br>
Nature's touch is slightly faster, but the efficiency is the same unless you're talking about a manadump situation.<br>

Trust me, if you implement all changes, druids STILL will not be main healers on raids, <br>

Exactly, and we STILL don't want to be.<br>

Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
You are not, quit thinking you are. You ARE NOT A MAIN HEALER ON A RAID. YOU ARE NOT A CLERIC. YOU ARE A DRUID. D-R-U-I-D. If you are not supposed to be healing the MT, and your raid should not be taking excess damage, explain to me why you need better healing powers on raids. You are asking for changes that will impact XP groups, it will have ZERO effect on a raid, because you will STILL not be a cleric.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Yeahp, I'll still be a druid.  I want it that way.  If I wanted to be a cleric, I'd make one.  Since I don't have one, guess what?  I don't want to be one.<br>

Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------Heh, this couldn't be further from the truth. My best friend plays a 60 druid. He's in one of the uber guilds on the server. He functions very well on raids, in the role of SECONDARY healer and grouping with me on the xp grind, in the role of PRIMARY HEALER. I have no issues with druids at all, they are a fine class, and they are very balanced. When played by an intelligent player, they offer A LOT to the game. I am saying that the changes you requested are not needed, and they are very selfish in nature. Trust me, if shaman had a list like this, i'd be doing the same thing to them.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Guess what, I don't care what your friend does...have him come here, at least he knows what issues druids have.  Take a look at any &quot;uber&quot; guild...tell me how many druids they have.  Look at AL, druids are the only class listed as 'very low'...It is NOT because they have too many...it's because we bring so little to the table.<br>
<br>
Listen, the bottom line is this...this whole petition is not about druids wanting to be clerics, it isn't about us soloing better...We want to function as a backup healer, in ALL situations...  We want to bring something to the raid table.  I don't know about the rest of the druids here, I'd like to be able to outheal a paladin and a necro.  I personally think druids should heal better than shaman.  But even if not better than shaman, definately better than necro and paladin.  We currently do not.<br>
<br>
All the druids want is a reason to be needed.  There is just so much anti druid sentiment out there, that people hate the class without any logical reason as to why.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 4:32:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=470>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...wrong again vaaxx</span><hr size=1> Can't help myself. <br>
<br>
Some of this may have been said more articulately or politely by other posters (can't possibly read all this thread ... I will NEVER know why druids always get this kind of reaction).<br>
<br>
The post never said a thing about soloing.  It was and is all about what (or what little) druids do on raids.  Anyone in a strong guild knows 2 things.  First, clerics CH's rule the healing roost and always will.  No druid has a problem with that.  If I wanted to be a cleric I would have made one.<br>
<br>
Second, as much as the VAST majority of druids would rather be nuking, we are rarely given a choice.  The clerics in any guild will be focussed either on the MA/SA in CH rots, or on the main tanks in more traditional healing.  That leaves for almost any guild you mention a fair number of &quot;others&quot; who are allocated to druids, paladins and shamans.  We carry our weight, we play the challenge and we do what we can.  I can heal a group with melee in it on a Velious and earlier AoE mob - as long as the fight is short and I don't ahve too many doing melee.  I hate doing it, but I can.  <br>
<br>
I can also act as the main healer in an experience group, but really only do it well if there is a slower.  A shaman can replace a cleric all on their own in most experience situations.  Now for all of you who are squaking about the oppression of clerics, get over it.  No one in their right mind would choose a druid over a cleric for an exp group...it isn't even just about CH.  It is about Rez.  A druid just can't do that (and we dont' expect to).  It is laughable to suggest that druids are somehow competing with clerics for spots in exp groups.  What DOES happen is that in almost any experience zone you care to go to, you will zone in (lets say it is seb) and see about 10 assorted toons waiting and hoping for a cleric to show up.  The druid may get an invite for evac, but a wizard will be picked first cuz lets face it, they out damage us.  A cleric will be picked over a druid.  Not to say we can never get groups (we can) but to be blunt as a kick in the teeth, it is moronic to say we are stealing clerics work.  What we ARE doing with any increased healing ability is enabling the vast majority of players who sit and wait for that rare cleric to spawn to do experience rather than sitting on their butts at the seb zone in.  In terms of class balance, no class in the game should have the strangle hold on the ability of people to play the game that currently is in the hands of just a few classes.<br>
<br>
That said, if I am gonna be playing a cleric in an exp group I will usually opt to solo.  If I wanted to be a cleric, I would have made one (see above).  I can do it, I will do it, but it is not why I play a druid.  <br>
<br>
I do play a druid to nuke some and to have a variety of things I can do.  I accept that (other than fire and cold resists) I will not be the best at any of them.  But I want to be pretty damn good at something.  And again, before people get all worked up about ports....porting sux.  It is an annoyance and a burden for the porting classes every day they play the game...we get tells from complete strangers on the otehr side of the game world, get baraged by requests when we enter any zone, and are also asked by friends and guildmates at the same time.  If we were not willing to do this we would have stopped playing druids.  But don't wast any druids time harping on this benefit.  It is almost as much a curse as a freedom, and regardless, the PoP will change the way people can get around the world (and I am thrilled at the prospect).<br>
<br>
I do want to do more damage.  I don;t know if I need exactly the numbers and dmg per second posted in the original post, but yes I want a better dot than my best one.  Yes I would like my epic effect to be more useful outside of soloing (even in exp groups the mobs die to fast to make the long cast of the epic worthwhile).  Even changing it to a disease check from a magic check as someone suggested woudl be a help in making the snare aspect of our epic stand out from the longer and more reliable level 29 spell we have (I think ensnare is 29...anyway)...<br>
<br>
And most importantly, and at the heart of the original post, I want to be better at the job that I know I will be doing on any raid.  I WILL be playing a cleric...even a &quot;primary cleric&quot; for some group of people on any raid.  I can't do it well with the tools I have available.  We just can't heal the amount of dmg that raid encounters generate effectively, and I think it is reasonable to want to do so.<br>
<br>
For those of you who did come in to say &quot;god druids are so greedy,&quot; why don't you instead focus on addressing things that would balance your class out for the roles it ALREADY FILLS rather than criticizing people who intimately understand the demands of being a druid and have made a proposal to address them?<br>

If you wanna bring forth numbers of people actively playing any particular class, you're gonna have to ask verant.  Siting web based numbers is like putting a poll on the Chapters home page asking how many people visiting there have read a book in the past week, and then assuming that the results of that poll apply to the population at large.<br>
