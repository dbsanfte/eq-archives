That say to me that they're having trouble finding adequate numbers of quality guides. Given the abuse they cop here, in chat and presumably in game, I don't find that very surprising.<br>
<br>
None the less, after a year or so with my highest at level 30 and having seen a fair chunk of the world, I applied. I got a rejection via email. Fair enough I says, I'm not one of the big kids, maybe they want someone with a level 50 who's seen the exploits and stuff first hand.<br>
<br>
Then again after another year or so of play I have a char over 50, I've been playing for over two years, I've been a guild officer, I've raided, I've explored, I'm a lot older and wiser. I'm not an inexhaustable font of knowledge like some players but I think I've got a pretty good grip on the game. In addition, I have several years of customer service training and I play during a time period that is traditionally neglected (midnight till 6am US time). I figured they'd snap me up!<br>
<br>
But 5-6 weeks have passed since I applied again. No email. Not an acceptance, nor a rejection. What gives? Do they only want guides who live within 5 miles of the VI office? Do you have to have a level 60? Did you have to have been in beta? I'm pretty sure I can do a better and more honest job than the anus who tried to get a player to email his account details to a yahoo address. Do they not want any guides in the midnight till 0600 time?<br>
<br>
Anyone here a guide? I understand the approval process is a peer-review system so it's possible that people involved in the process may be reading this. Anyone care to comment on what they look for or what will instantly fail an application?<br>

Rejecting your application then not responding.<br>
<br>
I have to say that you have some big balls (metaphorically speaking hehe) to apply as a guide.  They get @#%$ on at regular intervals and have to donate their time for no pay or recognition other than people mouthing off to them saying crap to them etc etc.  All my talks with guides and GMs have been 1 minute or less aside from the time I got my head stuck in the ceiling of sol ro temple and was launched into lava hehe.  <br>
<br>
Usually my discussion with a guide/gm is this:<br>
<br>
1.) here is my problem.<br>
a.) we can help you<br>
b.) Sorry we can't do anything for you.<br>
<br>
if a.) proceed to step 2.<br>
If b.)  Ok thanks for your time.  Bye.<br>
<br>
2.) This is what happened can you help me?<br>
a.) Yes. go to 3.<br>
b.) no. go to 1.b<br>
<br>
3.) I get help thank them and that is it.<br>
<br>
<br>
here is what I see from some players.<br>
<br>
1.) This is what happened.<br>
<br>
If helped they are happy.<br>
If nothing can be done they Flame them and whine and moan and ask for a &quot;REAL&quot; GM and go over your head to get the same answer.<br>
<br>
Either way.  I think if they got you to be a guide you would probably do a good job.  2 years experience and PR skills are what they need.<br>
<br>
Good luck.  <br>

<br>
Now I am not sure on this, but mayhap you did not answer the " what would you do in this event " questions they way they want? <br>
<br>
I think that they go by key factors when they look at the applications.<br>
<br>
1. Do you fit all the basic requirements.<br>
2. Did you get most of the " where is this at " questions, and the what are the three ways to get to Qeynos from Freeport type questions.<br>
3. On the question type of " how would you deal with this problem if it was to arise " type question. Did you answer honestly or did you say what you thought they wanted to hear?<br>
<br>
Now I know from a friend of mine that is a guide on another server, it does take a while to get that " yes we want you or no we do not want you " letter. They had to wait for a bit to get there letter and then once they got the letter they had to wait another month or so before they got to start.<br>
<br>
This is VI we are talking about. As we all know they are not very fast at anything that they do.<br>
<br>
Do not give up hope is all I can say. I think it might be a good thing if you have not yet recived a " Sorry we do not want you " letter.<br>
<br>
Good Luck<br>

<br>
1/2 the test was a geography quiz. As a self-porter I've seen a *lot* of Norrath and was able to answer 90% of them off the top of my head. The confimation of obscure bits of information (who is the god of the gnolls?) required me to delve into ancient tomes of wisdom (troll the eq website looking for the lore).<br>
<br>
The second half was hypothetical situations a guide may have to deal with. E.g. A player has reported druids in EK are dropping druid epic weapons. or Two players have petitioned, one reporting someone KSing their camp and the other claiming they were there first so it's the others who are KSing.<br>
<br>
The way I figure it, 8 out of 10 petitions probably fall neatly into a '20 most frequent petitions' list. In that case I expect there will be a guidebook with sets procedures for dealing with these most common of petitions.<br>
<br>
For the most part, my answers were:<br>
- Verify the claims to the best of your ability. <br>
- Get reports from both sides of a conflict. <br>
- Check to see if there is an established procedure for this fault. <br>
- Deal with it as best as you can if it's within your sphere of authority. <br>
- Escalate if it isn't and provide the up-line with as much relevant info as possible.<br>
<br>
I don't know if they're looking for someone who will investigate the problem, use established procedure where possible, initiative where procedure is lacking and escalate if needed, or if they're looking for mindless yes-men who will simply run interference for the GM's while the GM's do the actual work.<br>
<br>
Frankly after having waited for this long without acknowledgement of any kind I'm rather losing the enthusiasm I had at the time. I honestly don't know what I'll do if I were to get an email today offering me a role <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /shrug <p>Sorcha Cohen<br>

So say, Tunare needs guides, they would look throuh the pool and claim him for Tunare if they agreed with that persons view points. If no guides are needed, they don't look in the pool, so please do not take offense.  Moreover, you could have applied at the end of an application cycle, meaning, a bunch of apprentices just got accepted, (they come in herds..), and so, it may be a while before certain servers need more guides.(Multiple servers seem to recruit at once it would appear from the size of the meeting a certain someone attended and told me about *COUGH COUGH*.) Level is no barrier to becoming a guide, there are many good guides I know who are sub 50.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, there is no "right" answer to the questions. For example: a certain someone I know answered on the qeynos question, truthfully, yes I would tell him how to get to wherever. This person was accepted because the GM/Seniors liked how that person thought. Other servers may be in favor of more ridgid guides.  Also, some of the questions were not answered(Who the hell is the god of the gnolls? I don't know!)<br>
<br>
Your probably floating in purgatory. Again, don't get mad that they have not responded to you yet. Simply consider it like this: There is a mountain of applications, but only three people with gardening shovels(The tiny ones), and so it may take a while for them to uncover the little gem you are.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, I live half a continent away from VI, was not in beta, and was not 60 when..well. . *wink*. I'll leave that for your imagination.<br>

<br>
For what I remember is that there is a pool of applications that have passed the test.  The test consists of spelling, location of mobs/cities, and how well you reason.  Spelling is a big issue from what I understand.  The reason is that you deal with people whom English is not their first language, so you need to spell correctly due to the hard communications with them.<br>
<br>
Sorcha, as a Guide, I truly loved it.  I felt I did help people, and I found it a pleasure to explore Norrath.  But, it was very trying.  You deal with rude people when you can't do their every whim.  You get scamed, yelled at, lied too, and basically told off when they don't want to understand the PNP.  Now, you do get to have the enjoyment of stopping KS, Camp hogging, and overall answering newbies questions.  I always will have fond memories of seeing a level one clerics' corpse in full gold armor, and he was trying to convince me he wasn't a twink, and really didn't know that Guides couldn't tell players where their corpses were.....lol.  <br>
<br>
I was also a maverick Guide.  I did rez people for bugs, I did try to help when it was a VI problem.  This got me attention of both the players and the GM staff.  I was really miffed when a GM-Admin told me I couldn't rez a player due to the FD bug, I rezed them anyway.  To me the player came first and not VI.  That did get me in a tell war with the GM, but they turned around and sponsored my SR. Application..../shrug.<br>
<br>
I would e-mail them and see what's up.  They might just have your e-mail address wrong, or your app just expired.  I wish you luck and many many Tylenols when you try to explain what the PNP is and why its ok for 3 Guilds to raid the plain of fear at the same time.....that took forever.<br>

<br>
Five months after my second application I was accepted into the guide program. I was placed on a new server as an apprentice guide, and unfortunately apprentice guides aren't allowed to apprentice without an actual guide online. Since my free time was in the evening hours at that time, I rarely found guides online so I could finish my apprenticeship. <br>
<br>
After several lengthy e-mails between me and the Lead-GM, who was apparently very anxious to get me to full guide, I decided that while I was willing to give up my time for guiding, I wasn't willing to rearrange my schedule to get through apprenticing.<br>
<br>
So, with regret, I left the program. In retrospect, it wasn't that hard to get in, but you might be surprised how long it takes for somebody to grab your application. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.proaxis.com/~ryouga/images/bremsig3.jpg"></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorchacohen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SorchaCohen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/12/02 10:59:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=955.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://rodden.net/webgfx/sashield.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's with the guide program?</span><hr size=1> MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br>

It could be there is noone on the team atm or they could be swamped with applicants.  It does take a while to get graded depending on the number of people on the grading team, and the number of applicants at the time.  <p><center><img src="http://sionna.emich.edu/hos/sig4.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucreac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Creac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/13/02 1:28:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=955.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.the-farm.net/piccies/creaccolour2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What's with the guide program?</span><hr size=1> They get very busy.

<br>
When you're asked to answer the questions about responding to petitons, the grading team knows full well that you have not been exposed to the policies and procedures before answering these questions.  So they know you are not going to hit the nail right on the head, but what they ARE looking for is common sense in handling a situation set before you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Every nice person you meet tho, will do the Jekyll/Hyde routine the moment you say you cant help them.<br>
