She wished her twin brother, Cyris, were there.  He always knew how to give comfort.  A precocious young man of impeccable character, he was in the monestary now preparing for his ordination.  Cerres didn't know whether to curse him for his intelligence or herself for her lack thereof.  She just knew she missed him terribly and felt that since his absence the Swiftfyre home had been nothing but turbulence.<br>
<br>
Cerres sighed realizing that, in fact, she and Cyris had been born into turbulence.  Ripped by an eagle from the womb of their dead mother, their father lost in mourning, the twins had been rescued by the lovely druidess who had just slammed the door vowing never to return.  While she inisted she was only an aunt, everyone else saw her as their true and only mother.<br>
<br>
Opening the door with caution, Cerres peaked out into the gathering room.  Sylvanar stood staring into the fire.  &quot;Daddy?&quot; she asked softly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes princess?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is Mom ever coming back?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvanar opened his arms and Cerres fell into them, the tears she had been fighting falling softly.  &quot;I don't know.&quot; Sylvanar whispered as he stroked Cerres' hair.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Why can't you just tell the Empress you love Mom?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Empress demands total loyalty, princess.  There is no room for failure from a heart split by two demanding women.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I hate the Empress!&quot; Cerres blurted out.  Sylvanar laughed heartily as he heard his lover's words echo in his daughter.  Cerres pouted and looked at him sternly.  &quot;It's not funny!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvanar grew serious and looked directly into Cerres' eyes.  &quot;We must each choose our path, princess.  I was sworn to the empress before I took your mother to my bed.  She knew that, but she could not live with it.  I tried, child.  I would have given her the sky.  But if I am foresworn in my duty, then I am not a man.  Now, don't you have studies to attend to?&quot;    <br>
<br>
Cerres swallowed her tears and returned to her room to practice Selo's Last Lament.  It's arpegios challenged her voice forcing her to control the shift into the chest.  Master Songweaver could not tolerate Cerres' lack of breath control for she belted the lower notes with fortissimo when Selo had sung them pianissimo.  <br>
<br>
Her last lesson had ended in disaster with Master Songweaver evicting her from the Academy. &quot;I will not teach an apprentice so conceited as to believe she knows more than the composer. When you have learned humility, you will find the essence of this lament.  If that ever happens, which I fear it may not, I will allow you to re-apply for your position in this school.  Do not be presumptuous for you have one and only one opportunity to return.&quot;<br>
<br>
The music shook in Cerres' hands as she stared at the lament.  Only Cyris knew of her humiliation.  And now she felt like a fraud, practiciing a song she would never sing.  She could not tell her father.  She had no mother to confide in.  And her life seemed as if it had no future.  Folding the music, she tossed it in her pack along with her drum, flute, and horn.  Rather than pretend to be the student she never was and face her father's penetrating eyes, Cerres crawled through the window.  As she made her way to the monestary, she prayed that Cyris was not in seclusion, that he would see and understand.  He had told her to tell the truth.  She hoped it was enough that she had not lied.     <p>Cerres Swiftfyre <BR>
