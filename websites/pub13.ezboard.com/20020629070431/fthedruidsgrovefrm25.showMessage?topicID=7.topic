I can no longer naked gank and snare the 50th lvl melee who has good resist gear because he spent UPTEEN HOURS getting it, WTF !

We can't have a level playing field, lets make all your resist debuffs do 30% more!  Not only can you cast through walls, exploit and whatever else, but these &quot;tanks&quot; at 50th lvl have the same hps as a 30th lvl mob !  We MUST make them even easier to kill !  Your naked ass must be able to compete with a fully geared melee, who is actually risking equipment loss !  (Funny, cuz it's true.)<br><br>So the question remains...

Straight knockdown drag out brawls between people who dislike each other and have the desire to wear good gear so the guy he hates doesn't post a nice kill pic on his guild websight.

Unleash the anger on his azz. :)<br><br>Group+tank-  be a paladin, LoH is gonna save ya alot.

Higher lvls sk is alot better pvp though.<br><br>Enchs- always a pain in the butt.  Good on the jump, but if you get jumped other caster classes are better at surviving.<br><br>Clerics-  Who care's ....  You can rez yourself on an exp loss server.  That pretty much says it all. :)  Like rangers, new server clerics will be putting the smack down on you, nobody is going to have that high MR.  A cleric is also a pain to kill.<br><br>Shaman-  are always tough kinda like druids.  They are solid solo and solid pvp + they have a good pet.

Here is why.  By stacking his buffs correctly, a shaman can have his top 2 slots open for dots to debuff and tash to cure poison on.  While, still having 12 or more buffs that you have to debuff before you even get down to his MR and his SOW and hps buffs.  It is entirely possible to unload a whole pumice plus a pillage (4 buffs removed) and STILL be facing a fully buffed pissed of shaman.<br><br>The more junk buffs you can toss on yourself to avoid having your good buffs stripped off the better, and the shaman is the best at this by far.  A shaman is a beast pvp.  <br><br>Ench's I dislike because there only means of escape is gate.  Shamans and druids both have SOC, which hands down rules.  Necro's and wiz's have shadow step/yonder wich are very nice also.  One on one pvp sure an ench is nasty.  But most of your pvp encounters will either be escaping group ganks, or group ganking the guy you hate with your buds.  Keep this in mind.  But enchs are still very tough if properly played.<br><br>So, what we have left is the shaman, the druid, and the bard.  You already have a druid...  SO another one will probably just bore you to death.  Although very good in pvp environments.  So lets nix the runt.<br><br>Bard you gotta twist different songs pvp, you hate twisting, so lets nix him to.  Although they can be very fun pvp, imho.<br><br>Leaving your last choice, the ogre shaman, which is an excellent choice.  Lets face it, shamans are beasts, and pvp they are also.  They are tuff, poison based and disease based dots, have a good pet.  Survivability DUE to their buffs is extremely high, plus they have soc.  I trust you are intimately familiar with soc.<br><br>You'll be able to solo with the best of them.  OH, also shamans have access to ALOT of good pvp gear.  Things like the blood stained mantle, sentry armor (NICE), etc..  Also on a new server the sow potion business is going to be booming, so you can cash in on that.<br><br>Also RPing a huge fat ogre or greenskin who likes to eat people is gonna be alot of fun.  But, if you are tired of the dark team thing, you can always pick a barb shaman.  Shamans look cool to, armor/spears/pissed of dog etc..<br><br>So based on my uber analysis and what you've posted, I'd say go with the shaman.  You can't really go wrong with these hard ass's.  (UNLESS of course you want to be really really bad ass and play a human druid....  /uber.)<br><br>Maybe you can group with my soon to be terror of sullon zek bard. :)<br><br>Good luck,<br><br>Mance Malhavoc<br>Shadow Gypsies<br>Ring of Steel<br>Rallos Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uecchu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecchu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/19/01 10:00:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choosing a PvP class</span><hr size=1> I guess Shaman it is!

Killing people isn't what always makes someone great at pvp - knowing their role and surviving is. <br><br>If I went with a group to wipe someone out of a zone and my cleric is nuking people while we have health dropping or dots needing curing, I'm not gonna be with that person for much longer. A good pvp'er will know the roles of classes in a group combat situation and know how to survive solo in that class. You might not be filling the hard drive with killshots, but you'll be respected as a good ally for knowing what to do and doing it instictivly.<br><br>One other thing to think about is what class fills your own personal style. I play a druid because I really like the wide range of abilities a druid has, one of those being our extreme mobility. I like racking up the killshots and that's something a well played pvp'ing druid can do, both solo and with a group. If you like to keep others alive while others do the work, maybe a cleric is for you. If you like to cripple your opponents down and toy with them a bit before releasing the hounds, an enchanter would be a nice choice.<br><br>Choosing a class to play on a pvp server can involve a lot more thought than on a blue simply because you have to pick a class you can survive with in a wide range of situations every moment you're logged in. <p>--------- Aeeleb Treelover, the Tactician<br><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=59799">Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeoni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peoni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/13/01 6:29:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choosing a PvP class</span><hr size=1> Its my opinion that at high level the strongest PvP solo classes are<br><br>1) Bard<br>2) Shadowknight<br>3) Ranger<br><br>However at lower and mid levels where they don't have all their disc's/spells and resists they are much weaker than some other classes, particularly casters.<br><br>Earlier on Magicians and Enchanters are very effective in PvP but they lose there strength as opponents acquire Jboots and Resists to nullify the potency of their spells....<br><br>Necros are a very strong PvP class throughout their career, especially in the early-mid levels but even at the high end game are strong in pvp.<br><br>Druids fall into a similar category as Necros but as your dots are so easily dispelled and your nukes normally resisted in the high end game, you are much better to work with a tank partner who can interupt any attempts your target makes to dispel...<br><br>Best partner combo imo at lvl 60 ?<br>Druid/Bard<br><br>Peoni Greenleaf &lt;Defiant&gt;<br>Naturewalker of Tunare<br>Hierophant of Vallon Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umekiare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mekiare</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/15/01 5:51:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~wysper/_uimages/wolf1.jpg height=248 width=200></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choosing a PvP class</span><hr size=1> gear or class does not make the PKer.<br><br>crappy pkers are going to stay crappy, no matter how much wonderful spells/gear they have.

If i was a cleric i'd be much more unsucessful in pvp - therefore i believe class does have some factor in how good/bad your career will be (however learning to make the most of the abilities available is  what makes the difference between an average or great pvp player).<br><br>Gear - again, if i was to remove the 200MR i have and instead fight with 65MR i'd die alot more - more magic based spells would hit - they'd hit for harder and longer (the same goes for any resist), everyone knows snare/darkness landing is more than often the end for a player.<br><br>Gear means alot in pvp. Although i think a successful pvp player will be more selective about his gear than a poor player who just goes for +wisdom items (in the case of a druid). MR is something you should try to keep high - even when your exping, as often attacks will come from out of no where.<br><br>&gt; crappy pkers are going to stay crappy, no matter how much wonderful spells/gear they have. Good pkers will make themselves known.<br><br>Well i'd like to think pkers can learn from mistakes and improve on there skills. I know when i first started to pvp i went through a learning curve where i'd end up running away more than i would be the victor - maybe this had alot to do with my inadequate equipment at the time, maybe i hadn't got a firm grasp on understanding how buffs/debuffs stack and the importance of making sure you do so dispel is an option, or maybe i just needed experience in pvp to get a grasp on class strengths/weaknesses and what tactics work best against different opponents.<br><br>Players who can quickly adapt to a pvp situation when a random factor arises and keep there calm when they are attacked rather than panicing are those that make a name for themselves. PvP isn't static, neither is every encounter fought with nearly the same tactics, like PvE mobs. <br>PvP is varied, it requires fast communication between group mates and it requires adaptation. Good pvpers have expert knowledge of both yours and your enemies class and the ability to react and counter your opponents moves. Good pvp players have a sense of sportsmanship and respect for their enemies while poor ones enjoy nothing more to fill the /ooc channels with abuse talk when they are running back to their corpse.<br><br>Peoni Greenleaf &lt;Defiant&gt;<br>Naturewalker of Tunare<br>Hierophant of Vallon Zek<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufeiht.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feiht</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(10/30/01 6:32:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Choosing a PvP class</span><hr size=1> Bards rarely die and if you know you class, usually win.
