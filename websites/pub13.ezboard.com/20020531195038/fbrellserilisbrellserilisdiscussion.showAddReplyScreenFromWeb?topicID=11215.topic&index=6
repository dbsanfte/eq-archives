If you run your raids entirely in house, points seem to work very well.  They also work well only if you raid a LOT.  If you're going to have one raid a week, or two a month, or one a month, then it'll be completely disheartening to your members to realize that they have no chance, in the foreseeable term, to every get to the point where they could get anything out of attending your raids.<br>
<br>
Also, the point system must be fair.  Point systems that award bonus points to pullers and leaders and loot-masters and stuff are inherently unfair, because he who determines who fills those rolls controls who gets the points.  There are a lot of people who can pull, a lot who can lead, etc, etc.  If your system is one where anyone's favouritism can affect who gets more points, it will not be respected by your own members.<br>
<br>
You must be prepared to award points to your invites and to track them, or else you must run your raids ENTIRELY in house, because it is patently unfair to abuse people so the half of the raid that's in the point system gets recognized, and the half that isn't does not.<br>
<br>
The final problem, already stated above, is that point tracking requires tonnes of effort.<br>
<br>
My guild has an elaborate point system, and tackled this problem because we're blessed with Veranon, who made a fantastic database-based website that makes the tracking and managing of our point system very easy.  It took him a long time.  Points are awarded for attendance at the slaying of powerful mobs.  Points are spent on the items they drop, and whoever has the most points of the people interested in an item gets it--no random, no questions.  We have restrictions on a few items that forbid certain classes from getting them when members of certain other classes need them, but these are VERY few and far between, because teh system functions well on its own.  We value our points, and tend not to waste them on stuff that isn't REALLY GOOD for us, so we tend not to take items &quot;better suited for another class.&quot;  You can see something of how it works here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.silentredemption.org/members.cgi?sort=total_dkp&asc=1">www.silentredemption.org/..._dkp&asc=1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
and here<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.silentredemption.org/lootrotation.cgi">www.silentredemption.org/...tation.cgi</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
(You have to log in as a member to see all the point details about items, and as someone with corect permissions to see how the database is modified, but trust me, it's slick.)<br>
<br>
The whole thing is tied together, so that we use a database of existing mobs and their drops, with point values for items we have established ahead of time (or establish on the fly via a prescribed protocol when something new drops), and lists of our members and recruits to make for easy entry of raids, and automatic point calculation.  We use a private forum on our message board for people to make corrections if they were mistakenly not given points for a raid.<br>
<br>
Now...  That is well and good because it matches our size and play style, and because we were lucky enough to have Veranon, but it may not be right for all guilds.<br>
<br>
Previously, we did something else.<br>
<br>
We called the &quot;council system.&quot;  Every time we killed an uber mob, all of our present officers plus enough extra members determined by /random grouped together to make a 6-man council.  One of the council members collected names of everyone interested in a specific item that had just dropped, and then there was private discussion in the council, and then voting to see which of the interested characters received the item.  If there was a majority (4,5, or 6 votes) for one person, they automatically won the item.  If there was not, it was /random'ed 1 to 6, with each vote counting for one spot in the random.  (So if the votes were Khoren, Bob, Khoren, Jane, Dick, and Spot, the random would be 1-2 Khoren, 3 Bob, 4 Jane, 5 dick, 6 spot).<br>
<br>
This system accomplished the goals of making sure loot wasn't awarded by straight-random (which was unfair to people who raided a lot, particularly where first-time invites won uber loot), and that the loot went to people who could use it best (we used, particulary at that time, a lot of main-tank strategy for raiding, and we needed beefy warriors).<br>
<br>
However, although it worked fairly well for several months, and THEORETICALLY encouraged loot into the hands of those who &quot;deserved&quot; it (for all sorts of contributions to the guild, not just nightly participation), after awhile, people began to lose faith in it, believing that some members were discriminated against, and others were favoured.  This was inevitable.  The system is a solution to some issues, but can also cause some of its own.  Also, the system worked as long as it did because we raid virtually every night, and when you didn't win one night, you knew for sure you'd win sometime in the next few weeks or month or so.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in its deepest stages of decline, the system damaged some of the trust in our guild, I believe, and certain poisoned the atmosphere now and then.<br>
<br>
So our migration to points seems, in hindsight, to be particularly effective.  I freely admit that I was opposed to the point system in principle when it was proposed, and now I am quite a fan of it.  It allows only one determining factor in the awarding of loot:  Your raid attendance.  To us, that is an important measure, and it IS a measure of how much time you give to the guild through raids.  Also, we expect all of our members to do their best on raids, so we don't consider any one person's attendance to be more valuable than another's.  If you made a point system for yourself, you may award bonus points for non-raid activities, and that is well and good, but we do not do that.  We try to keep the system very objective, allowing no one's discretion to enter into the awarding of points, so all members are on a level playing field.<br>
<br>
The natural argument is that this is not fair to people who cannot raid all the time because of other commitments, but, as a semi-active player, I can tell you, it's very fair to award loot that way.  I am way down on our point list, which means I can't get the BEST items, but I can still get good items, or items after the really active members (who deserve them and need them more) already have them.<br>
<br>
So, I can only relate five personal experiences with loot:<br>
<br>
1) Open random in a smaller-scale guild.  This tended to cause the odd result that seemed unfair because members who were rarely active could win the very rare uber loots that we got.<br>
<br>
2) A point system with discretion (points awarded for pulling, leading, etc) in a smaller-scale guild.  The majority of members who talked to me about this considered this to be a failure.  It serves the leaders of the guild in a way that some other members may find alienating or unfair.<br>
<br>
3) Open random in a hyper-active large-scale guild.  This discouraged us from ever taking invites, and made us less polite and more exclusionary than when we used:<br>
<br>
4) A council system in a hyper-active large-scale guild.  This was much preferable for quite some time.  My first loot I won with SR was one of the first bile chokers to drop from CT, and that was before I was a member.  We used this system to reward members AND very active recruits, but in the end, (after about 9 or 10 months) it began to decline and arouse suspicion and ill feelings, and so we turned to:<br>
<br>
5) A raid participation point system in a hyper-active large-scale guild.  And I believe, after about 2 or 3 months of experience with it, that this is working well and fairly.  And let me tell you, it sure encourages participation. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But, also, honestly, at the same time, it allows members to feel less guilty about not participating because they can rationalize that they are taking nothing away, loot-wise, for their absence.  This makes it possible to take guilt-free breaks when they're needed.<br>

<br>
You have brought up some good points and some ideas our officers need to discuss.  <br>
<br>
If we decide to implement the point system it will be very strict - awarding points for being on time, each hour on the raid and completing the raid - possibly an extra point for those that are there from start to finish.  The last thing we want to do is hand out points left and right.  <br>
<br>
I have heard of a concept of silent bidding/auction but no one has been able to explain to me what the benefits of this type of system is.  I am thinking it's used if something nice drops - those that want to use their points to get the item send a tell to the Loot Supervisor stating how many points they wish to bid.  The person that bids the highest wins.  However, what if any, are the benefits of doing this silently?  Seems to me it's opening the system up to be abused.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again for the input - you guys are great!<br>

You should have faith in your point system and in its values, and if your members accept them as fair, they won't want bidding either.<br>

to better equip your raiding force and to do harder mobs faster, council or dkp is the best way, anything that involves /randoms is flawed, because of the inherent nature of randomness. <p><img src=http://ickhor.homestead.com/files/verymean.gif><br><font face="Arial" size=2 color=#FFFFFF><b><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=blue,strength=#+2)"  ><font color="#FFFFFF"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29047>Gear</a>*<a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdracaena>Drac</a>*<a href=mailto:nihil@ijustdontcare.com>Mail</a>*<a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell</a></b>

if you're all pretty new to raiding, i'd suggest random until you've got your stuff together, and i'd also make sure you have internal discussion in the guild about it.  ya might find your guildamates liking what ya propose.  <br>

<br>
I thank you all for your ideas/input.  I was asked to gather information on looting and you all came through.  We are planning an officer then guild meeting to discuss the options and will make a final decision then.<br>
<br>
The idea of drops going to highest character (providing that person raids often) intrigues me.  The logic behind it makes a lot of sense - if your highest players have the better equipment, the more chance they have at staying alive, the more successful raids you have, the more chance of equipment/items dropping - the guild ends up in a really nice cycle.  If I'm understanding this concept correctly this is what could/would happen during a raid. Guild is raiding and a really good melee bp drops - main tank's (the guy that is our tank if he is there) bp is no where near as good -  the bp automatically goes to him.  What do you do if a lesser item drops - how would it be distributed? <br>
<br>
Another question came up last night - do all guilds require their members to pay raid fees?  For those that don't - how do you cover the cost of peridots/reagents for chanters/clerics?  Right now on our baby raids we haven't charged people - we can make enough plat from the raid to cover the cost and any extra goes into the guild vault for future raids.  In most guilds I've been involved with they have charged for raids - Fear/Hate/Kael 100pp or 10 peridots - PoA/Growth 250pp or 25 peridots.  My main use to be a necro and while I would always pay the fee I would never receive any benefit of being buffed.  I only raided a few times and it really seemed the guild leaders/raid leaders would walk away with extra stacks of reagents.  I'm probably in the dark in this matter but if you have 30 people on a raid - charge those 30 people 100pp/10peridots - Do the clerics/chanters really go through 300 reagents?  Maybe someone can enlighten me on this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Again thanks for taking the time to answer my questions - I can't begin to tell you how much help the information you've shared has been.<br>

I can't remember ever being on a raid where I had to pay for or bring reagents.  <br>
It seems to be most common that the raid leaders pay for peridots and all raid costs, and they also keep cash loot to cover this cost, and thereby most raids make a profit. (group leaders loot kills if their group gets the exp, all group leaders turn in cash loot at end of raid).<br>

Any planar raid, other than PoA, that is charging you to join is ripping you off.  Every mob drops on average 10-16pp, random jewelry cash items worth 50-200pp, and high end gems (diamonds, blue diamonds, etc).  Add to that any spells claimed by guild that weren't needed on PoG raids and that total goes up even more.  Here is a recap of the last Hate and last PoG raid I ran:<br>

As you can quickly see, our guild (Not SR, this was my old guild I was leader of) made a LOT of cash even without charging raiders entry fees.  Of course that cash got eaten up on a PoG raid where I had to summon 22 bodies from under Tunare's Tree after our scouts took 3 deaths each trying to pull them and I wasn't about to make them lose any more xp. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=maroon,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>

<br>
Our point system seems to be working very well and I don't think VE will be raiding anything with totally in house folks.  In fact it's raid policy that 1/4 of our raid consists of those who are not VE members and typically try to fill them with people we don't know.<br>
<br>
The trick was finding a point system that rewarded people for activity but didn't make it so overwhelming that it would ward other people from joining.<br>
<br>
We did a compromise.  First off we made sure that no one would ever be completely out on an item.  You always get at least 1 number on anything you CaWU.  Secondly to insure that people didn't rack up enormous amounts of points, we made the number of points received low (1 per raid) and made it policy that anytime points were used to win an item, they then were returned to 0.<br>
<br>
I wrote a quick simple CGI that updates the points automatically so record keeping is real easy too.  It gives small rewards for those who raid with us often, but doesn't lock down those who are new to raid with us.  It's a fairly delicate balance, but it does work well.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean it would suit everyone, but just saying we're about as non-In House as you can get and we've made it work well and it does serve the purpose of what we wanted.  Which was rewarding those who help out without taking from those just coming in. <p><br>

It was simply too much work on the loot roller to make the method we were using effeciant (although it was fair).<br>
<br>
Perhaps in the future we will move to a point system, but right now BI awards major loots and all epic items as the council sees fit (based on level, raid participation, and in the case of epic items, how close to completion)<br>
<br>
We also have a &quot;hand me down&quot; clause, where if a member wins something on our raid, and then wins something better later, you're required to pass down your old loot to someone else in the guild. (if it's tradeable of course) It's a win-win situation for all involved. Haven't had any complaints with the system so far, so we're doing something right. <p><img src="http://www.fftrealm.com/content/pics/line.gif" width="300" height="2"><p><a href="mailto:MiriamelePrester@aol.com?subject=EZBoard"><img src="http://www.fftrealm.com/content/pics/miri.jpg" width="300" height="42" border="0"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubludraptor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BludRaptor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/30/02 9:54:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11215.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Question on loot rules for guilds</span><hr size=1> The DKP system is an incredible system. It works very well, especially for people who raid at least 3 times a week. When loot is counciled or randomed, then people have the attitude of only attending something that drops loot that they want. With the DKP system, people will show up no matter what, to get points for themselves, and to help their fellow guildies and friends help as well. In the end, DKP system is a lot more maintenance but in my opinion, is well worth it.<br>
<br>
People are gonna get upset when say ToV armor is randomed and an inactive level 54 paladin wins plate legs over a highly active 60 warrior or something. Also, council is hard to do because there's nothing &quot;behind&quot; it that people can see why who won what, it's just using good judgement really. But a few times they could make unfair decisions or people will think it's more of a popularity contest. It works well though 90% of the time and doesn't require nearly as much book-keeping.<br>
<br>
Also, i'm not sure if SR does this or not, but there's a possible rule in the DKP system called a weekly adjustment, where it brings all the members close to the average or median points by a very small percentage (maybe 1% or so). This way, it will give the inactive members a headstart when they get back (but they'll still need to work hard). And will keep the extremely active members not so powerful where they can win anything they want whenever they want (tho they'll still get a good deal of what they need). <br>

So did we, but there is a very huge difference between the amount of loot we get each night/week/month and the amount of loot BI gets each night/week/month.  It becomes increasingly harder to judge who is due for an item when you have members who have 10, 15 and 20 items on there list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubankhulaxehand.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bankhul Axehand</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/31/02 12:10:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11215.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Question on loot rules for guilds</span><hr size=1> Okie...it's getting late and my brain isn't functioning at it's optimal level....<br>
