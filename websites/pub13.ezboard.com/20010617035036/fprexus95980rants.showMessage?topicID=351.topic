<br>
Most unfortunately he was in my guild and had been made an officer (after nagging the guild leader).  Then one day he sees me on (iksar monk) and decides to log his own monk on as well.  Soon as he logs on he sends me tells expecting me to go twink him out.  I figured what the hell, I gotta couple pos items I dont use in the bank.  So, I went to the bank and gave his monk a couple items and went on my merry way.  Not 1 min later I see him /oocing begging people to come give him some more items...<br>
<br>
Another time, one of my friends had, I think it was an abram's axe of the stoic, that he gave to the guild leader to use.  My guild leader couldn't use it so he gave it to Barathul under the conditions that if Barathul ever left the guild or if the guild leader asked for it back at any time, then he would have to give it up.  Couple months past and Bara was still using the axe.  My gl was told by my friend that he needed the axe back.  So, my gl sent Bara numerous tells saying that he needed the axe back, but he wouldnt give it at all.  In fact, he stills has it...<br>
<br>
Now here's where it gets interesting...<br>
Bout a week or so ago, several members of my guild went into SolA to go kill stuff and have fun.  Along the way some belt dropped (forget the name) and Bara looted it.  When his group members asked him about it, he replied &quot;Oh, i thought it was a leather belt so I just destroyed it.&quot;  So, I told one of my guild members that was on the raid to petition him.  The gm showed up and checked his inventory and sure enough he still had it.  When the gm asked him about it, Bara destroyed the belt and told the gm that he didnt have it.  After the petition was over, Bara told the members of his group that he would kill whoever petitioned him...<br>
<br>
Now thats f'ed up.  First of all, trying to ninja some common drop from your own guildmates and also lying to a gm about it.  And finally threatening to kill his group/guildmates over it.  What a immature pos.  I'd advise people to stay away from this prick as much as possible.  Thank you.<br>

I mean, Barathul invited me into pax crepreum.  I was out adventuring with him and a full group in the sarnak fort one day and he was 1 of 2 tanks.  Me a wizard was the leader<br>
and I noticed that barathul kept going afk.  Now you know that that area can get really trainy, so I felt that is was not in the best interest of the group to keep him in it, so I kicked him out of the group, and they rejoiced.  After that, barathul threatened to remove me from the guild and spammed the hell out of me for the rest of the day.  (god I love /ignore).  I had him removed for about a month when he gave me a black tome with silver runes.  Which I liked.  Anyway, I later found out that he is a 12 year old kid.  As an adult I feel that kids have no place in Norrath.  Look at all the rants about various players.  I bet that the most annoying characters are played by kids under 16.  Now barathul is banned from Prexus and will be kicked out of the guild, and I was promoted to officer thanks to Barathul's vaccancy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujunie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>junie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/12/01 2:00:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/gallery/RallosZek/FFTEN.jpg width=126 height=114></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Barathul...</span><hr size=1> they put in loot messages recently,.. not just to the group but to the person who looted the item as well. for example if i looted a cloak of flames,.. it would give me a message saying i looted a cloak of flames like this <br>

He was banned for lying to a gm saying that he didnt have the belt AFTER the gm had checked his inventory and confirmed that he did indeed still have it.<br>

Like it was stated above, he's a 12 yr old, immature, pos and I'm glad to see him go.<br>

<br>
I agree that kids that young have no place in norrath for the most part. I have met some younger kids that were very mature for their age and acted civilized. But if you are only 12, more than likely you are going to be immature. You haven't grown up yet, and for the most part, you aren't going to realize how you should be acting.<br>
<br>
I understand you being upset, but a 12 year old kid doesn't deserve to be called a pos just because he acts like a little kid. He is one! I'm sure you never done anything stupid when you were his age to piss off people eh! <p><b><i><font size=2><font color=blue>Molex Evilslayer<BR>

Well it as shown me to becarefull who you try to help out. I also agree he is 12, and should not be called a POS, he is just young, in his case too young to handle this game.

Wudon, I don't want to get down on you (I know how angry you are, we were all there), but he is 12 and should be labeled as an imature child.  I wouldn't call a kid a POS.  And Bara, if you see this, I hope you have learned a valuable lessoon.  Your punishment did fit the crime I am sorry to say.<br>

finally someone that understands, thanks<br>
<br>
my reasons for calling him that...greedy, selfish, begger, lier, cheater, stealer, whiner, and immature little prick.  All these wonderful qualities award him the title of p.o.s...and on top of that, I just dont like the mf'er.  He embodies everything I absolutely hate about EQ.  I dont care what age he is.  If he acts like this at 12, he's going to be the same way when he gets older just like Andervin said.  You guys can disagree all you want to with me, but this pos is a pos in my book and will always be a pos.  Thanks for listening and enjoy the rest of this thread. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
