<br>
Our beloved Dodder has been brutally slain.  Killed by Dark Elf Guards, on an unknown mission.  His belongings were brought to his fellow guild members in the fields of the East Commons.<br>
<br>
The cries of horror from his fellow brothers and sisters could be heard throughout the land. And later the questions and the need for vengeance pushed some of Dodder's friends to the edges of the known world, and beyond; to lands unexplored.<br>
<br>
Some time after the death of Dodder, a lone traveler was heard to tell a tale in a tavern in HighKeep.  He spoke of a wraith wandering the Common lands, crying out for vengeance.  Crying out that the body that had once housed this poor soul had been slain before his mission could be finished.  Thus the spirit had been doomed to wander his path until his death was avenged and his mission completed.<br>
<br>
Many different people, from the lands of the Elves, to the coastal city of Qeynos, told this story with sorrow in their eyes and hearts.  Many claimed to have seen or heard the phantom, and it seemed as if the spirit roamed the area between the Tunnel to Northern Ro and Nektolos Forrest, but occasionally it had been reported to be seen in Erudin, or even as far as Unrest.<br>
<br>
Some versions of the story had the spirit tracking something, highly concerned about the direction from which it came, as if the spirit were afraid of being followed.  Some told the tale of the wraith pursuing something as if bent on vengeance.<br>
<br>
Soon after the wraith first appeared, the tale was told in the presence of one of Dodder's fellow brothers-in-arms.<br>
<br>
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*<br>
<br>
Mentor was sitting in the tavern that he and Dodder used to meet in. It was this very tavern that Mentor first met Dodder, when the fool ranger thought to heckle him during one of his storytellings.   Thinking of Dodder brought to mind the tale of the wraith that has been rumored to be haunting the Commons of Freeport.  He had only heard the tale last night, when he stopped at a camp of two young druids.  How these two events would be related Mentor could not say.   Until he happened to talk to his fellow guild sister, Ainasa, that very night.<br>
<br>
Fully intent on finding out more about this wraith he had heard of last night, he quietly sat in a dim corner.  Tonight, was one of the few nights he didn't want to be called upon to sing a tale, for he was more interested in the hearing of one.  The bard drew some attention at first with his Wood Elven features, dark hair, and vibrant blue eyes, but soon when the citizens saw he only meant to sit at his corner table, they lost interest in him. <br>
<br>
After a few more ales, Mentor was ready to retire to the room he had rented for the night, when suddenly the door to the tavern opened and a figure stood in the doorway.  Firelight gleamed off the surface of the warrior's crafted armor, and the noise in the tavern died down as the citizens of Highkeep wondered who had come into their midst.  <br>
<br>
Mentor felt eyes upon him and drew further back into the shadows; he wanted no trouble with the newcomer.  He only wanted to sit, drink his ale, and hopefully hear about the spirit.  The door closed and Mentor heard footsteps approach his table.  He sighed and prepared to start singing Tuyen's Chant of Flame.  Although he wanted no trouble, he did not think that this day would be a good day to die.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ha, can't hide from me bard.&quot;  Came a melodious voice, close to Mentor's ear.  Soft and sweet, the voice brought to mind the trees and fields of Kelethin, visions of home.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ainasa, every time I hear your voice I think you should be a bard.  Then I remember your singing.&quot; With that Mentor looked up and smiled at the lovely Wood Elven Warrior.  And promptly forgot all about singing a song of battle.<br>
<br>
With hair the color of spun honey, and eyes as blue as the Ocean of Tears, Ainasa was truly a vision to behold.  Mentor wondered how many men lost their hearts to her right before she took their lives.  If he hadn't been such good friends with Banidain, and a loyal Protector of Norrath, he would be jealous of his guild leader.  For two years ago the two warriors had pledged their lives to each other.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ment, I've heard stories…&quot; Ainasa sat down and ordered herself ale.  The two friends talked long into the night, telling each other the bits of information they had gleaned from stories and rumors told around campfires.  &quot;I believe Dodder's death may have something to do with the appearance of this spirit, in fact, I think it may even BE Dodder.  And if it is we owe it to him to find out.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two sat back, quietly thinking about all they had just learned, all that was happening in their world.  Mentor thought of the story the druid told him, of the Spirit in a red tunic tracking something, running very quickly.  So quickly they had been unable to keep up with it even with Spirit of the Wolf.<br>
&quot;I agree Ain, I find that I am curious as to what, or who this is haunting the Commons.  If it is Dodder, then we as Protectors and his friends owe it to him to put his spirit to rest.  Lets get a good night's sleep, and set out for the Commons in the morning, by time we get to the Forest border it will be dusk, and hopefully we will see the wraith.  <br>
<br>
The next morning, they set off in the in which direction they had last seen Dodder, the East Commons border to the Nektolus Forrest.  During their trip they both have dreams of Dodder, and even see the wraith late one night traveling from the Tunnel of the Northern Ro desert to the Forest border.  Before they get close enough it disappears, but they do agree that it was in truth the spirit of their guild brother &quot;Dodder.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ainasa, that was Dodder.  He was wearing that red tunic he was so proud of.&quot;  Mentor said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ment, he was crying out in sorrow.  Did you hear the longing in his voice?&quot;  Ainasa asked.  &quot;He is morning his unfulfilled mission.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, it was anger Ain, Dodder didn't want to die, but something convinced him it was preordained.  I never understood why he didn't just come back to the gathering.  All of the Protectors could have handled a couple of Dark Elf guards.&quot;  Mentor stated.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Anger?  No, you are projecting your feelings onto the spirit.  We are all angry he died, but Dodder was morning his fate.  That must be why he is here!&quot;  Ainasa exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ainasa, it is vengeance Dodder wants.  I hear it clearly.&quot;  Mentor said, exasperated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ment, what are we doing?  I'm getting angry with you!  And I don't understand why.  You are as concerned about this as I; it has to be this place.  We are too close to the Prince of Hate and his children; I can feel the hatred for us.  Lets go home to the Protectors and tell Banidain about this.&quot;  Ainasa said.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's too late to do anything now, lets move a ways away, up on the hill a bit and camp.  Tomorrow we'll go to Ban and call the rest of the Protectors together, and maybe some of our allies.  We'll try and find out a way to release Dodder's soul.&quot;  With that the two friends began to set up camp and they talked of other things, until finally Mentor said they should get some sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;You go Ment, I'll take first watch.  I don't like being this close to that Forest.  And Ment, I think if we could find out what Dodder's mission was we could find a way to help him.&quot;  Ainasa said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agreed, but we will find a way Ain, trust me.&quot;  It nearly broke Mentor's heart to see Ainasa so sad.  He hoped for her sake, as well as for Dodder they would find something, anything out.<br>
<br>
Little did they both know that Dodder's mission would soon become the mission of the Protectors and their friends.<br>
