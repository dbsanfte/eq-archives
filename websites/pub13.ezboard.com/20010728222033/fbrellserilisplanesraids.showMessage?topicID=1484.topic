QUESTION:  Has ANYONE ever raided the 2nd Floor of Hate?  Especially since the last patch?  I was on one of the walls and went up near the ceiling, and the next thing I know I popped up through a hidden hole in the ceiling onto the second floor.  Once on the second floor, I could not get down without going through the Ramp in Inny's lair, which was out of the question at that point since everyone got wiped out prior to even making it to the Maestro.  The hidden hole in the ceiling I went through closed up when I went through it, I guess it is one way only.  Once I went through the ceiling, I found myself inside a building on the second floor well away fram the spot I was at on the first floor.  This building had NO MOBS in it.  To get off the 2nd Floor, I followed a loc to where everyone was on the first floor, then when I was above them they /targeted me and then summoned me using CoH.  While I was up there I went though the entire zone.  As far as I could see, NONE of the mobs were able to see through my Rogue Hide/Sneak invis combo on the second floor like some of the mobs on the first floor.  I was able to walk up on them safely, and even check out some building.  There were patrols walking/running around.  There were NO rats, Lichs's, Revulants, Ghasts, Banshees, or Chests up there.  There were a LOT less mobs on the 2nd Floor than on the 1st Floor, but EVERYTHING on the 2nd Floor conned Yellow and Red.  The mobs on the second floor were wearing some awesome looking gear, so who knows what they drop.  I have never seen any of the 2nd Floor mobs on the 1st Floor.  Since the last patch, most of the guilds going in have gotten totally wiped out before making it to the Maestro, and that was with 42 people in 7 groups.  Once guild leadership figures out a decent plan that WORKS for clearing the first floor and dropping the Meastro and Inny, I would like to clear the 2nd Floor so we can document exactly what the drops are up there.  We could start early one Saturday morning and just go until there is nothing in the whole plane alive but us.  On the 2nd Floor, there are LESS mobs then were on the 1st Floor, but they are higher cons.  The building layout is totally different, there are LESS buildings and more open areas, and one of the walls is NOT slanted and CANNOT be climbed.  I was able to scout the 2nd floor until Rarik was able to hear my yells so that they could /target me.  This is an endeavor that could succeed  if we could get the cooperation of a few of the major guilds.  The point here would not be to get loot per se, but to clear the whole zone and finally document the 2nd Floor.  The only problem I see is with the amount of people needed to accomplish this, the lag might knock everyone out, unless this next patch addresses the Planar Lag.  As soon as I get more gate potions I am going back up to the 2nd Floor to check it out and try and map it so I do not have to chance getting /targeted and summoned.  That is all for now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaarkus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maarkus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/27/01 12:46:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 2nd Floor Hate</span><hr size=1> I have fought on 2nd floor on every raid up until the last two... Cruc.. last night was an issue becuase they chose to move into an area where people were getting Gfluxxed up to the 2nd floor and instead of sitting there and dieng they ran back down thus bring with us denizens of the 2nd floor.<br>
<br>
2nd floor is easy when your actually fighting on the 2nd floor. Most pulls up there are very manageable because your more or less move around upstairs. I would hope that yesterdays disappointment has made those that are hoping to run a future raid to heed our warnings that we gave them =( <br>

Either way, I don't think I'll ever move camp anywhere other than: Portal house, Cleric Chapel, Maestro's Lair, Inny's old chamber. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1474.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1483.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1484.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1484.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1484.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
