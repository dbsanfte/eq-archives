I think the pottery Tunare idol was wisdom on it (karana one does) and you could get that pretty cheap for your range slot.. just a few suggestions off the top of my head. <p><img src="http://www.orderofhasson.com/members/tygersig2 .jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaereajaciabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saere Ajaciabre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/02 3:12:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26253.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 151wis I am a loser</span><hr size=1> Dear Nikko,<br>
<br>
First off, your gear doesn't make you a loser.  /bonk  We can aspire to wear the things that other druids are wearing.  Maybe we will have the privilidge to wear them in the future, maybe not.  Either way, it doesn't make us losers.  <br>
<br>
But it does help.  ;)  So onto some of my ideas then.  You didn't say what race you were, but you mentioned a Tunare item, which means you are not a halfling.  (You poor thing.  /tease)<br>
<br>
Runnyeye has been upgraded with some new items.  Level 40 may be a little low to go down and kill Battlewizard what's his name, Uzak?  He drops an AC5, +5wis/int medallion (neck piece).  My server is Inny, an older server, and I have seen the medallions sold for about 300pp.  The Tunare piece you mentioned is not familiar to me, so if this is an upgrade to what you have, then yay me for providing an idea.  If not, then on to the next idea.<br>
<br>
The earrings were just mentioned as &quot;crappy&quot; and I can only take a guess as to what that would mean.  Get out to Frontier Mts and start killing giants for forest loops.  Or, get a group and kill the three giants that spawn in Firiona Vie.  They are AC3, wis/dex/str3 I believe.  The AC and wis combo will be good for you on a pvp server.  The nicest part about the giants in FV is, not many people camp them so you won't have as much trouble running into others there.  At your level you will need a group.  Use harmony to split them.  Or if you want to spend the cash to buy them, do so.  Do some price checking and shop around a bit because it's a Kunark item and those items have been out for a while.  I wouldn't pay over 250pp per loop.<br>
<br>
Shoulders -- Braided Ivy Cords of course!  AC4, wis+5. You can pick them up cheaply (200 - 300pp maybe?) from any ranger who had to do the ivy quest, or kill Thistle Underbrush in Lesser Faydark.  He's level 22, but casts... Apparently he does not drop the cords every time, so you may be there a while.  Again, this is a pretty common item so if you would rather spend the money then you should be able to find some fairly inexpensively.  <br>
<br>
For a face item, I would just purchase either a silver (+4wis) or platinum (+7wis) ruby veil.  My observation is that these two items have decreased signifigantly in price since Velium veils became available.  Do some price checking and find your friendly jewelcrafter near you who is selling you one, or if you are in a guild with someone who can make them, it may be cheaper for you to purchase the components yourself and ask them to make it for you.  Up to you.  These items do not have AC though.  <br>
<br>
The only idea I have for legs right now is gatorscale, which are +7 AC +4 Wis +15 HP +0.40.  You camp the Ancient Crocodile in Upper Guk, or again you can try to purchase them.  Maybe someone else here can give you a good guesstimate on what they may cost.<br>
<br>
There are a few other old-world items you could go and get, but this should get you started for now.  There is also some mid-level quest armor for druids that came out with SoL.  In your post you say you are not Velious or Luclin capable and I'm sorry, I can't remember if that means you cannot wear items from those expansions.  Because you are wearing ulthork arms, I am going to assume you can?  Someone please post and correct me if I am wrong.  Anyway, I believe this armor is tradable, so maybe you can purchase some of this stuff.  That's just an offhand thought.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<br>
You don't HAVE to quad to play a druid. <br>
<br>
My Half Elf (with post AA base of 90) has gone through 54 levels and 12 alt advancment levels, so it's possible to play the game effectively without having the lauded &quot;200&quot; or doing a quad. (For the record, mine WIS is currently at 176. Most of my life it's been around the 150s)<br>
<br>
Did it take me longer to come as fas as I have -- sure it did, but it's time that I ENJOYED. <br>
<br>
The best part of the trip to 60 is the enjoyment of the journey and not the speed at which you arrive. :)<br>
<br>
You might also look into the first four steps of the Coldain prayer shawl as well as the Qeynos Investigators quests if they are stil available. <br>
<br>
I will pop on afterwhile and make a list of my equipment.<br>

I really appreciate all you guys helping out this newbie.  Thanks for mentioning some of these items.

I have a friend that is gonna make me a plat ruby veil so I am hoping that will help for now (trying to save pp for BD gear) and a friend is promising me a Forest Loop or 2.  I'm also thinking of a blackened alloy medallion and am constantly looking for Thistle to see if he'll be nice a drop me some cords.  But I am still looking for ideas and would love any other input people may have.  Thanks again.<br>

BTW I still have lots of fun killing single dorfs in BBM.  But downtime sucks.  I suppose atleast I can do homework while I med.  One day I hope to quad them.......<br>

The prices are sometimes inaccurate,,,but it is still a good reference to bookmark. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaereajaciabre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saere Ajaciabre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333399>(3/1/02 2:55:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26253.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> What about bracers?  Get a group together and kill Goonda in WK.  He drops a few different things, but the chipped bone bracers are +5 wisdom.  Give those a whirl.  He drops a few different items so it may take you a while to get those.  <br>
<br>
Now when I camped Goonda I was level 35 and I got my butt kicked.  The other mobs that spawn around him were all green, but he was blue, he has a pet, and he casts.  There was only one other person with me at the time and we were just way too low to do it alone.  Of course back then when you got rooted you lost your sow/wolf form, so it was harder to do.  At level 40 you will probably still need a group, but someone may want to confirm.  <br>
<br>
The mammoth leggings really aren't that bad.  They give you some cold resist which isn't shabby, and you will need that for pvp.  I promise you that there are quite a few other druids here who wore those for a time too.  *wink*<br>
<br>
If I think of anything else, I will come back.  Good luck!<br>

Sure you can.  I just went over to the Equipment section, and searched by slot.  I pulled up all the neck items, and started at the bottom and looked for good wis neckpieces.  Works just fine, and I don't pay for any service.<br>
<br>
Unless you meant that you wanted to search specifically by wisdom or for druids, but that's not what I was talking about.  You want to save 10 minutes on your search time, you can pay for it.  <br>

Go to a site that doesn't insult its viewers (AND contributors) by demanding money.  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/wink.txt><br>
<br>
The <a href=http://eq.gameznet.com/eq/search_item.html>EQ'Lizer Search Engine</a> will let you enter any parameters you want for the search (including slot, zone, ranges of numbers for stats, class, etc.), and will then give you all the results in a table plus links to screenshots.  Far better than Allakhazam, free, faster, and usually contains more high end items. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 3/7/02 6:33:24 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessageRange?topicID=26253.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showPrevMessage?topicID=26253.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showNextMessage?topicID=26253.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26253.topic&index=20><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.emailToFriend?topicID=26253.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.threadControl?topicID=26253.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26253.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=26253.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm31">Interface Design<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment>Druidic Equipment</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
