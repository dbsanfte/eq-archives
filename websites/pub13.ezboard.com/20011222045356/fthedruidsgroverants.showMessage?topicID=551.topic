<br>
Background:  I am an introvert.  Roughly 10% of the American population are introverts, the other 90% are extroverts.  While I have noticed great patience on the part of an introvert concerning an exuberant extrovert, I have also noticed that a lot of extroverts do NOT understand that introverts just want to be left alone.<br>
<br>
I work as a security guard in a firm (a meat shield) that employs a lot of computer technicians, people I have always admired because there's no way in hell I can do what they do.  I am an English major - I dive headfirst into Shakespeare and Keats.  I am full-time college and work full-time, hence I am almost always studying at work.  If I have some rare time I read a novel for pure pleasure.<br>
<br>
Now ... this frequently happens ...<br>
<br>
Techie_01 stops by my desk on his way out the door.<br>
Techie_01:  Good night!<br>
Me:  (looks up from book, makes eye contact, smiles) Good night!<br>
Techie_01: Whatcha reading?<br>
Me: (holds up book to show him)  Shelley.<br>
Techie_01:  Who's that?<br>
Me:  A poet.<br>
Techie_01:  Oh.  Never heard of him.  (Which I always figure, since they are not English majors)<br>
Techie_01 Leaves.<br>
<br>
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a mean person, I always smile and make eye contact and so on.  But why do people feel the need to ask me what I'm reading?  When I'm reading a novel it's always this ...<br>
<br>
Techie_02:  Whatcha reading?<br>
Me:  (shows him the book)  Tolkien<br>
Techie_02:  Ohh...  Is it good?<br>
<br>
No, it's a pile of crap.  Tolkien is so putrescent that I can't believe I'm even holding the stinking, putrid book.  I'm forcing myself to do penance for eating that pint of Haagen-Daaz last night.  Of COURSE it's good, you freak!!  Why on earth would I read it if it wasn't??<br>
<br>
Someone please answer me this .. (or don't, it's a rant and I'm not looking for the answers :) .. Why do people feel the need to make inane, useless conversation?  Why can't they say &quot;Good night&quot; and leave?  Why do they have to obviously interrupt what I am doing to ask me something they don't even care about?  Why can't people just keep their mouths shut?<br>
<br>
Next topic:  Microwave popcorn.  I love it.  It's cheap, easy to make, delish, and fills me up.  Each and every time I make microwave popcorn at work, WHY do people (in droves, mind you) feel the need to walk by my desk and say:<br>
<br>
Employee_01:  That smells good!<br>
<br>
Why, yes.  It tastes good too.  Do you want it?  No?  Then shut the hell up!  Why would someone tell me my lunch smells good if they don't want some of it?  Just to make conversation?  You're not stopping to talk to me, just walking by.  Why do you have to open your mouth?  Just keep walking!  I'm busy reading my penance Tolkien!<br>
<br>
OK, all better now.<br>

<br>
But.  I'm definitely an introvert IRL.  No matter how much I want the above conversation to go on, it doesn't.<br>
<br>
My little question:  Why is eye contact so important to everyone?<br>
For some reason, no idea why, I find it extremely difficult.  The only reason I ever try is because some people find it rude not to... but I still don't understand why.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, I never shut up online.  People always tell me I'm real noisy on the guild channel or ooc.  <br>
I guess it all boils down to knowing there's someone paying attention... I prefer not to know who's listening when I'm rattling stuff out on the keyboard :) <p>-- <br>

<br>
introvert: To concentrate (one's interests) upon oneself.<br>
anti-social: Holding disdain for conversation with others.<br>
<br>
Some people like to keep their thoughts and feelings to themself in conversations and that is what an introvert is. There's nothing wrong with that, but it is felt that an anti-social, or not willing to partake in conversation behavior, can be a harmful thing.<br>
<br>
How harmful can be anyone's guess, but most anti-socials I know in real life or even online are very lonely people. Most play on computers, work a lot, read, or do some kind of activity to keep themself active or unoccupied by lonely thoughts.<br>
<br>
My two cents would be to welcome those warm questions of inquiry by your fellow co-workers :). True he might not know what you're reading or even be interested, point is he was trying to be friendly and was making an effort to be kind and not just pass and ignore you like most people do today walking into a lobby, passing by the guard or secretary without even a glance or a hello.<br>

I essentially don't leave the house for any reason other than work. This is something people seem to have difficultly in understanding, I am perfectly happy with everything I have in my house, nice net connection, fun game (EQ), drums, tv and food.<br>
<br>
My friends are online so its not like I never talk to them and just about everything I do is online so its sort of a social thing anyway.<br>
<br>
I personally hate talking to people, I have to feign interest just to be polite but I would rather just ignore people. Its a lot easier to simply be polite than start an arguement and make an enemy no matter how much you hate the person that talks to you, otherwise they will start making more of an issue of it and you can't get away with the simple 'hello'.<br>
<br>
I personally work in school (hardly the best place to avoid people) as a PC tech, so I always have hundreds of kids asking me what i'm doing and always asking me 'do you know lots about computers?' - no... thats why i'm stood here disassembling 3 of them, I always just wondered how many tiny men were really in there. I have to agree with the first post, I think people feel uncomfortable with silence, I can sit for hours without doing anything and be perfectly content with my thoughts.<br>
<br>
I tend to speak with single syllable answers so conversations end quickly, particularly if i'm not in the mood to talk. I'm the opposite in EQ though, although I prefer to solo and have almost never grouped in 2 druids to 45 and a warrior to 22 I still talk an awful lot with people I meet while solo'ing, i've never done the guild thing either.<br>
<br>
I don't know if i'm intimidated by groups of people but I don't think thats the case as I have to shout at groups of disobdient children to get them to leave the IT room or line up whenever they mess around.<br>
<br>
I'm not unconfident, I just prefer my own company to that of others and I find it very hard to make friends with new people. I've probably spent far too much time around computers as i'd prefer to communicate something like them, no non-essential communication, that'd be good =)<br>
<br>
right, think i've said too much already - just glad to see i'm not alone, us druids are a strange bunch =)<br>

This started months ago. :) But, nonetheless, I feel compelled to comment. ;)<br>
<br>
Well, I myself, am an extrovert and always have been sociable. I like greeting people I come across on a daily basis and make "small talk" to let them know that I appreciate their presence. But at the same time I can appreciate introverts. Hell, half of my family are introverts, I just so happened to be the "mutant" if you will. In Laogheire's case, perhaps the computer guy greeted you as his way of letting you know that he appreciates your presence, and the protection it provides. <br>
<br>
Laogheire said: <b><i>Why would someone who went to school for computers ask me what I'm reading? 9 times out of 10 they've never heard of it, they just say so, shrug, and walk off .. why is it necessary to interrupt my STUDYING, if it's obvious that's what it is, just to say "The Tempest? Never heard of it."</b></i><br>
<br>
Lao, personally, I'm offended by your comment. I've always been a straight "A" student since first grade. Now that I'm in college, I've majored in Biology, Psychology, and finally settled on Computer Science. I've never even thought about chosing English as a major simply because it didn't spark my interest. But does being a computer science major make me (or anyone in my field of study) too ignorant to know of fine writers such as Shakespeare, Tolkien, Shelley, Whitman, or Hemmingway? I would sure hope not. Who are you to judge that just because someone went to school for computers, are unfamiliar with poetry or other fine literature? Sure their emphasis was not in literary arts and perhaps does not have as strong a background as you, an English major have in it, but it doesn't mean they are not educated enough to not have clue about your field of study?<br>
<br>
English is a required course for all US universities, and I highly doubt that anyone with a college degree would've graduated without some sort of knowledge in fine English literature. I would assume that since you work for a computer firm that its employees would hold some sort of higher learning degree, since the computer industry has advanced to be quite a competitive field.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with silence and wanting to keep to yourself.  As an extrovert, there are times when I want to be left alone. Sometimes, solitude is nice. That's why I played a druid back when I still played EQ.  It's for the times when I just wanted to have some alone time and not be bothered.  If I wanted to group, I had my cleric for that. So I can understand an introvert's desire to be left alone.<br>
<br>
If someone is unfamiliar with an author whose work you just so happen to be reading, why not spend 30 seconds of your life to educate them?  If the person insists on carrying on a conversation, just politely tell them, "I'm sorry but I must return to my studies."  You'd be amazed at how many friends you could make. Even the most introverted person can never have too many friends. :) <br>
<br>
Judging someone as not knowing what you might be reading just because they're a computer techie is just downright...ignorant. <p><CENTER>

I can see how this would get annoying.<br>
<br>
And I didn't get the impression that it was *all* computer people who did this, but people where she works.  I also didn't get the impression that it was a computer company.  I think she was saying that often it is computer people who do it, and was trying to make a point that, since 99% of the time, they say they don't know that author, why would they bother to ask?  And if she's having constant people saying they'd never heard of &quot;The Tempest,&quot; I can see where her frustration comes from.<br>
<br>
I honestly didn't see her stereotyping computer people here.<br>
<br>
She was also responded to by people who basically said she had to get over it and become more extroverted to deal with these people.  That's a stereotype as well, that all introverts are antisocial and need to get over themselves.  Why should introverts need to change their ways to get along in the world?<br>
