<br>
Just another point about these &quot;arguements&quot; ...<br>
<br>
Children aren't being asked to pledge to god in these cases outside of the supervision of their parents. A child isn't president, no matter how childish I think some of them are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A child isn't immigrating on their own. And, a child isn't in court without his parents or a proxy to act on their behalf. But, a child is in school and has to have the mental capacity to stand up and say &quot;No&quot; to a teacher when it comes to the pledge. <br>
<br>
Adults can make the decision ... children are the issue here and they don't always have the ability to object to authority the way we do. So, just the pledge saying &quot;Under God&quot; is not inherently bad, but when schools are having it said every morning then it becomes a problem since children, at younger ages, lack the mental structure to be so forward as to object to the pledge's wording and be able to explain to the teacher why. At that age I would have just gone along with the crowd and not made waves no matter what law said the schools couldn't force me to say it.<br>
<br>
This is the ultimate problem ... if its people at a company then the adults can make decisions on their own with 20 years of experience and the capacity for higher reasoning. Kids of 5-15 years old don't exactly have the mental capacity to fully understand what's going on and why, or if, they should object.<br>
<br>
If they can't change the pledge then take the pledge out of schools totally ... or have the schools only use a modified pledge ... or something so there is no pressure on kids to be the ones on the front lines of this debate. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sienea>Sienea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 2:40:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=402>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> I look at it like this.<br>
<br>
(Brief note, I'm very much Agnostic)<br>
<br>
Here is the perfect example.<br>
<br>
Christmas, originally, the celebration of the birth of Christ (Nowadays it's just a commercial holliday but that's besides the point) Everyone put's christmas decorations up, angels, mangers, and the like. Out for everyone to see. Now...let's look at the other end of the spectrum. Someone who believes in Satan instead of God. If that person ever put the kind of decorations that accompany that faith out on their front lawn, they'd force him to take it down and/or possibly arrest him (depending on which state the person is in).<br>
<br>
I have to ask myself why? That person isn't doing anything the Christmas people are doing, just celebrating his religion. He probably finds all the Christmas decorations just as unbereable as everyone else finds his. Yet, no one forces everyone else to take down their angles and mangers, or consider them crazy for believing in something they have never seen nor have any proof of. Which is all the guy who believes in Satan is doing.<br>
<br>
To me, it's just hypocritical. I don't see why it should even matter what a person believes in, if Joe Schmoe down the street wants to believe that Gary the Gopher created the universe, more power to him. Why label him as mentaly insane for believing that when the billions of people that believe in something that they've never seen (At least Gary the Gopher was tangible) are labeled sane.<br>
<br>
There's a serious problem in this country and it will eventually backfire on us all, I just hope I'm still around for that momentous day. <p><img src="http://www.damn-skippy.org/images/sieneab.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uklark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 4:38:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=403>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.twilightcouncil.com/sigs/tc5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> &quot;Adults can make the decision ... children are the issue here and they don't always have the ability to object to authority the way we do. &quot;<br>

I think the point has been sidetracked. No where does the constitution allow for the maturity of adults over the maturity of children. If you are going to argue that the pledge defines a respect for an established religion, then you cannot take into question the audience. Either it does or it does not.<br>
<br>
And, the intent has been twisted to suit the argument of those against the G-word. Basically, an authority figure saying the oath. If a person (including a child) is watching a court or a congress or a president use a pledge to a higher being does not that fill the case of an authority figure saying the oath. If a president says &quot;And I thank God for being elected&quot; or &quot;I trust in God to protect this nation&quot; and a child watches that on TV, is that not as bad?<br>

<br>
I don't think the point is sidetracked at all. I'm just refuting the statements by some people who say &quot;you can just leave God out of it if you're not christian&quot;. Not all people, especially children, have the emotional and mental capacity to stand out of the crowd and say &quot;I won't say the God part&quot;. And, this is where the entire case is coming from. Its not enough for the courts, imo, to say &quot;can't force the kids to say the pledge&quot; because the schools aren't exactly being progressive in this manner. They're continuing to say the pledge unless someone objects ... and who's the person who has to object? A kid. A kid that doesn't really understand these concepts yet. No matter what a parent says to the child he probably doesn't have the mental capacity to grasp the concepts yet. Maybe the courts need to make a stronger assertion and say that the schools shouldn't be reciting the pledge, at all, until later grades when the kids can actually understand the concepts involved. Prior to that its just, frankly, a very mild form of brainwashing in getting them to repeat it over and over again every day.<br>
<br>

<br>
But, just seeing it once in a court, or once on TV, is not the same as having to listen to it EVERY single day in schools and maybe reciting it themselves for fear of causing trouble by objecting. One is a one-time thing ... the other is a daily indoctrination into the concept that &quot;God&quot; is somehow protecting the USA.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Remember, parents raise children, not schools. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Then the schools shouldn't be repeating the pledge every morning and making references to the USA being &quot;under God&quot;. If its up to the schools to raise their children and only the jobs of the schools to educate ... then keep the schools out of things like pledges and religious messages, no matter how vague. Can't have it both ways. Why, afterall, is there a need to force the parents to come into conflict with the schools over the pledge in the first place? Why must the parents and kids stand up to the regular school procedure just so the kid isn't saying things that are against his religious beliefs every morning?<br>
<br>
Take the pledge out of the school totally. Let the parents who believe the pledge should be said every morning have their kids say it before they leave the house. People who object to the pledge can not have their kids say it and those who like the plege can say it morning, noon, and night for all anyone else cares. But, imo, I don't think that's going to fly at all with most people because they honestly want the pledge said in every school every morning ... and if the non-judeo-christians don't want to say the &quot;under God&quot; part ... by &quot;god&quot; they'll hear it said by others. I think Eisenhower said what some people won't say today .... &quot;we'll make sure every school child is speaking the message of the almighty every day&quot; or something along those lines. They wanted to push the concept of Christianity on every child ... every day ... and that's why they changed the pledge in the first place. <br>
<br>
But, instead of going the route of removing the pledge from schools and letting parents decide for themselves they're actually pushing for MORE mandatory legislation. In February a bunch of states pushed for more mandatory reciting of the pledge. One school board that voted against it got backlash for not forcing kids to say the pledge every single day ... to the point that they changed their vote. Not just that, but many states are deciding to post &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on big signs in the schools. More and more religious messages and demands for patriotism from kids who're way too young to even understand the concepts. As I said, its mild brainwashing, its not patriotistm. You ask for patriotism from adults, you don't ask that kids too young to understand the concepts recite a pledge every morning. Well, you don't unless you're more interested in breeding a new brand of patriots and christians than you are in educating kids to make choices for themselves. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uklark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Klark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_cyanspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/02 7:11:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=405>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.twilightcouncil.com/sigs/tc5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> &quot;One is a one-time thing ... the other is a daily indoctrination into the concept that &quot;God&quot; is somehow protecting the USA.&quot;<br>
<br>
So the consitution makes reference to the quantity of exposure? Remember, the pledge in court is said every day, in each court around the country. This is an institutional practice that, if we follow the &quot;no God&quot; logic, is unconstitutional. What does a Hindu judge do in his courtroom?<br>
<br>
&quot;Prior to that its just, frankly, a very mild form of brainwashing &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, the pledge and that play-well-with-others thing. <br>
<br>
What sickens me is that one man's petty personal crusade has derailed the real need as Ididar pointed out - the need for objection to the subversive political correctness in our country. Our culture need to accept and not ostracize or demonize civil objections to things like the pledge but one anti-religion nut got the courts involved. Now there is a backlash that just strengthens the &quot;Billy is not saying the pledge; what is WRONG with him?&quot; issue.  The court system is the WRONG way to go about this.<br>

Second, yet another tedious back and forth on this: the judge does not make assertions about a religious view as a representative of the government.

One christian should not impose himself on the whole.  I do not believe that we should denature our society because of a few people.  I may be unpopular in saying this, but changes to appease the insignificant few worsen our society.<br>
<br>
Second, the discussion that the judge does not make assertions is like not seeing the forest for the trees.  If you are right, we should desist in using the G-word in federal use.  People are interpreting situational restrictions on the constitution ( not in a pledge, but ok for an oath, not to kids, not teachers, but ok for more powerful authority figures like judges, etc.) that are unfounded.

There's an important distinction between a standard pledge approved by the nation, and people who are taking an oath.<br>
<br>
To you maybe it's no difference, but to some there's an important principle about freedom of religion.<br>
<br>
That has been articulated repeatedly in this thread already.<br>
<br>
You can respond to earlier posts pointing the issue out if you like - for example, if it's ok for the teacher to say those two words which make an assertion about religion, then why not let the teach read from the bible for an hour? Why not let the protestants add language making it exclude not only the atheists, but the catholics, if they want?<br>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
(Washington, DC--June 28, 2002) Yesterday President Bush denounced the common sense San Francisco court ruling that decided children should not have to feel coerced to give false statements of sectarian belief in public school. With this decision by the court, there is now a hope that the Pledge of Allegiance can be returned to its original form, without the &quot;under God&quot; wording that the Knights of Columbus lobbied successfully for in the 1950s. <br>
<br>
Bush then went on to establish a criterion of particular religious belief for judicial appointments, saying, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   &quot;I believe that it points up the fact that we need common sense judges who understand that our rights were derived from God. Those are the kind of judges I intend to put on the bench.&quot; </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
“Bush's public statement of intent to discriminate on religious grounds makes a mockery of the US Constitution,” says Tony Hileman, executive director of the American Humanist Association (AHA). Article VI of the Constitution states “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” <br>
<br>
Hileman continues, “Bush ignores the 30 million Americans who identify with no religion, as well as faithful Buddhists, Hindus and others who do not subscribe to his monotheistic test for judicial competency. <br>
<br>
“We have begun to mobilize the Humanist community across the nation to speak-out against this outrageous violation of our rights as American citizens. Not only are we activating our network of 62 AHA chapters and 18 affiliate groups, we are also reaching out to the broader community of reason, made up of atheists, skeptics, agnostics, freethinkers and others. <br>
<br>
“‘One nation under God’ is clearly an unconstitutional endorsement of religion,” states Hileman. “While the US Supreme Court has ruled in the past that it is not a requirement of public school students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, students without sectarian faith were placed in the intimidating position of either refusing in front of their peers to recite the Pledge or being forced to pledge to something they do not believe.” <br>

<br>
A religious test for judges is un-american. Sounds like something the taliban would cook up...<br>
<br>
Hopefully the senate will tell him in no uncertain terms his appointees will not be accepted under such tests. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/sig/jaharad.gif" border="0">

<br>
First sentence:<br>
<br>
"Yesterday President Bush denounced the common sense San Francisco court ruling that decided children should not have to feel coerced to give false statements of sectarian belief in public school."<br>
<br>
Now, kiddies, can anybody spot the bias here? Ferris? Ferris?  Any journalism 101 kiddies around? How about characterization? <br>
<br>
ok you forced me to tell you. It's "the common sense San Francisco court ruling"!!!! It gets worse after this but the very first sentence sets the tone.<br>

Bush is correct of course. Our rights and laws have their origins from a best selling book known as the Bible. We need more judges with common sense and who understand their job is to be a judge and not a lawmaker. Thats why we have seperation of powers.<br>
<br>
Here is an article expanding on that theme and illustrates the problems with an activist judiciary:<br>

So you scream that one news source is &quot;biased&quot; when you don't agree with it ... yet quote over and over again from right-wing news sources and call them fact? Who's deluded in all of this? Yes, that news source is biased ... but so is every single one you ever quote. If you can't see that there is little hope for your ability to view the world through logical eyes.<br>

I saw a quote from one of the founding fathers the other day which said, in essence, that &quot;the laws of this country are not founded on any religion, but on the simple rights of men in a civilized society&quot;. Of course, you won't find a single Christian who doesn't believe that any sensible system has to be founded on the ten commandments, but that doesn't mean its true. Excuse me while I go find that quote and then you can take it and chew on it for a while ... and then maybe call your founding fathers some scum out to destroy the country. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udaconia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daconia </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/3/02 8:28:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=419>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.carolina.rr.com/mele/SwordOfFate/soficon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If you think this is scary</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Bush then went on to establish a criterion of particular religious belief for judicial appointments, saying, &quot;I believe that it points up the fact that we need common sense judges who understand that our rights were derived from God.

If Bush said that he is way out of line. I'd reccomend that he look up article 6 paragraph 3 of the U. S. Constitution. His testing of judges would be unconstitutional, he has just opend up a loophole that the Democrats could uses to stall the appointment of judges indefenately.<br>

<br>
&quot;For we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the date of Magna Charta, which terminates the period of the common law. . . This settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But Christianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion of the first christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about the year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here then, was a space of two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and Christianity no part of it. <br>
<br>
&quot;. . . if any one chooses to build a doctrine on any law of that period, supposed to have been lost, it is incumbent on him to prove it to have existed, and what were its contents. These were so far alterations of the common law, and became themselves a part of it. But none of these adopt Christianity as a part of the common law. If, therefore, from the settlement of the Saxons to the introduction of Christianity among them, that system of religion could not be a part of the common law, because they were not yet Christians, and if, having their laws from that period to the close of the common law, we are all able to find among them no such act of adoption, we may safely affirm (though contradicted by all the judges and writers on earth) that Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law.&quot; <br>
