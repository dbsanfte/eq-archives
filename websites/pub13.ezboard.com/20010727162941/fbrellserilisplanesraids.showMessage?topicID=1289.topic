I have seen and read similar articles already posted. And I also know the basic response of signing up for raids on planes that your items don't drop on. This I have already tried but it hasn't worked because I'm not selected for Fear either (except once) So the ability to see my character and how I play has not even been able to be fulfilled. I have to be honest here I loved Fear. (I was pull team chanter) That was one of my favorite hunts I've ever been on and If I'm selected again I want the pull team hehe... talk about pure excitement.. But when it gets down to the nitty gritty I want armor from Hate so I can be a better chanter in the real game (upper level dungeons just don't provide as good of caster armors) Some people may consider this selfish but from my own point of view I play this game from the standpoint of the challenge of the game (one of the reasons I picked a chanter) Also I look at it as my groups survivability is dependant on my survivability and that is dependant first and foremost off my ability to play and secondly off the equip on me. <br>
   So.. what I need here is to find out the best system to get on the planes for people (like me who have kids, job,and functions) that limit my availability on the planes. But before you answer read on please. Here is my problem. I work a night schedule that has me at work from Sun-Wed so this limits how many raids I can sign up on because they are held on evenings. Also with family this eliminates 1 to 2 days every week so when I sign up for raids I only have 2 days per week (Mostly Thurs and Friday) where I can actually make a commitment (Does this sound familiar to anyone) I am getting to know alot of people in everquest but this has not helped when it comes to raid selections (as far as I can tell) because when it gets down to it the raid leaders make the final selections.<br>
    I will put myself in the raid leaders position for a second. When I make my selections (from what I've gotten from the material I've read so far) my decisions are based first and foremost on 1. Who in my guild wants to go. 2. What classes are now needed 3. Of the classes I need, who are my friends that I can trust not to mess up and not get us killed 4. Who can I pick up from the rest who signed up (have they done their time, have they raided with us on the raids their stuff don't drop? etc etc etc.) I understand this and I know these are the basic questions asked and there may be more but I believe these are the major ones because I know these would be my concerns also. The raid leader makes these decisions based off these criterea. So with this in mind here are the questions I would like answers for please<br>
<br>
1. Back to the original question: How do I get on the planes raids (please answer this with the constraints I placed on myself due to RL because I believe the answers will benefit others as well as myself)<br>
<br>
2. How do I get to know these mysterious raid leaders so I can prove to them I'm one damn good chanter? I know this is my own opinion hehe.<br>
<br>
3. Because my days to sign-up are limited, will I ever get on these raids? (trust me this is not a sarcastic question) Or should I just wrap it up (because of my limited schedule)and plan to get my equip from other places? I've signed up for alot of raids (I read in an article that one person said it took 7 times.. It's been alot more for me) <br>
<br>
4. Does raid leaders choose players based off recommendations from their friends or is it their opinion only that matters? If they go off friends suggestions how much weight is placed on the friends recommendations?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

Sign up for every raid that fits your schedule and do other things with various guilds like the Hole KK FGs Dragons people get to know you and think hey that person always comes with us of course they have to come on our hate raid. ie A nice cleric came to fear with us when our clerics had some RL issues surface late in the game she took a run in death with grace and never even thought about loot till we asked her if she needed her shiny new belt. She then came on our next fear raid cuz she liked our raids. She now pretty much has a reserved spot for hate whenever she signs up.<br>
<br>
2. Do one bad thing be remembered forever do a thousand good things no one knows you.(Just a general thing not meaning you.) Its sad but its true though a couple people around here really deserve the horns. To get raid leaders attention in a positive way visit there websights and join other events. ie LA has about 3 raids a week 2 planar 1 somewhere else sign up for the somewhere else gets you known.<br>
<br>
3. Never stop asking I know Adun/Adune keeps track of people he leaves behind and eventually gets them in sure more do this too but can't name anyone off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
4. If any of my friends say so and so is cool and we've got room they going uptown.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I'm working nights too so my raiding is severly curtailed for awhile. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Go on non-plane raids with the guilds you want to hit the planes with.<br>
<br>
Chardok, City of Mist, anything that guild does, ask to go on.  The most boring things the guild does, sign up for.  Eventually, you'll get invited for something.  Show up on time, don't bitch about loot, and thank the raid leader for organizing it.  It isn't kissing ass.  It's a process.<br>
<br>
You'll soon be a regular on that guild's plane and dragon raids.  Trust me, it works. <p>Ganon Stormwynd <BR>

That's also a very good process in which to get into a guild.  If you're doing everything with them, are friends with them, and guildless, you won't be for long. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udulcineia01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dulcineia  01</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/25/01 10:22:01 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/dulcineia01?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The basic: How do I get on planes raids?</span><hr size=1> Being new to raids as well, and working nights, i feel for your situation.  What i do, is check the raid calender for whatever raids are on that night.  The go to the guild website, and/or the the thread here to ask to go on the raid.  Even on a weeknight there is almost always something somewhere that will be fun.  I'm not sure i agree with the idea to go on the most boring raids to prove yourself to a guild.  I am not at my best when bored out of my mind.  If you dont make the list, definately go as an alt!  I saw a raid to fear desperate for enchanters after two no shows.  While you really want hate, fear is still fun, and a good way to get to know the raid leaders.  Hate is easy to be an alt for, just go to spires, no need to run in like fear!  Anyway, that's all i do, check calender, look for guild webpages, then hope!  Not perfect, but with limited schedules, it works ok for me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  good luck! <p>Dulcineia Delamancha <BR>

<br>
And yes raid leaders do ask around on people they don't know.  I do this.  If I see someone sign up that is a class I need I ask my friends (especially if they are in that person's guild) what they are like.  Its really risky taking someone that you have no clue who they are....they could be Deamonwolf or Beliael /shudder.<br>
<br>
Best thing to do is just watch the boards and see what raids you can get into, not planar, but any.  Many guilds that hold smaller raids like Chardok, CoM, Kedge, etc at times tend to have a lack of good enchanters.  Stepping up and helping them will make a good impression and get you in future raids.  Too bad you work on Sundays as I have a Hate raid Sunday the 4th and could probably squeeze you in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukruuunch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kruuunch</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim</span><br>  Posts: 1333<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/26/01 10:54:35 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.krunch.net/kruunch-face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The basic: How do I get on planes raids?</span><hr size=1> Giving the raid leader 20K in plats and a Fungi Tunic doesn't hurt either. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)
