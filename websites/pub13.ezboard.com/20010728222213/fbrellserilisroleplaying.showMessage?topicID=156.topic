*Raises his head slowly. One can feel an overwhelming sense of contempt and disgust with life in general from the aura that surrounds him. His eyes give off a cold and apathetic stare as if he is looking at the world itself* So tell me... *says in a low mumble almost a whisper that increases the feeling of contempt in the air around him* ... do you know what true happiness is? Do you know, what it is? Do you know, its significance? Could you possibly understand, the long trying process needed to obtain it? *Lowers his head once again, shaking it back and forth before bringing it up again* I have heard your stories, heard about your conquests and your battles. I have seen the pride that rolls off your tounge as another story begins, another story that of course could only end in victory for yourself, because why else would you speak of it? My Iksar brethren, I have heard your stories as well, of unbenevolent races attempting to overthrow our city, of battles between us and people that just can not understand our way of life. And although I do not want to put my people on the spot, I am afriad I must ask you the same question. Do you know what true happiness is? I do not mean to contradict anyone's past triumphs, nor I do doubt the meaningfullness of anyone's tales. I am merely trying to open your mind to existances outside your own that you were probably never aware of. *Closes his eyes for a moment as if to gain concentration, and opens them and begins speaking in a slightly louder more confident voice*<br>
You see, ever since I was young, I was disliked. And not by a handful mind you, no, it seemed everyone disliked me. Since I first stepped out of my own cityt and had to deal with pesky annoyances like leeches and frogs that would attack me from behind for no reason, to the first time i stepped onto a continent other than my home and gazed on a race other than mine. Yes, although these days are far behind me, they do not cease to infiltrate my mind to this very day. For those of you who have already said to yourself that you indeed know what true happiness is, do you know what its like consistently hide yourself? To cover your image with the nothingness of air for fear that people that consider you an unreputable being simply because of your race will attack without hesistation the instant they lay eyes upon you? *starts raising his voice* Do you know what its like to gaze upon beautiful cities, wonderous monuments that one would think only the most wise and thus most openminded beings could create, only to realize that you will never be able to step foot in them because those who created them regard you as inferior and worthy only of death? Have you experianced, my dear freinds, what it means to look upon a person you have never seen before in your life, never had the chance to interact with, never even committed one wrong against since the day of your birth, only to see them scowl at you in a way only one who held the most furvent animosity in their hearts towards you could? Do you know my dear friends what this is like? For that matter, do you know what it is like to experiance this with every single race you come across? *pauses a bit to catch his breath* Do you know, my dear, DEAR friends, what it means to feel the pang of hunger, feel the sting of thirst, only because those who sell it insist onshowing people of your race and class the EXIT? Have you ever carried such weight that at times you feel as if you are almost unable to move becase there is noone around that will buy any heavy items on your person from you? *loudly, this time louder than before* DO YOU KNOW what it means to spend HOURS, upon HOURS, fighting and killing pathetic little creatures, creatures that dont give you any personal experiance because they are too weak to, creatures that it takes no more than two or three spells to incarcerate, creatures that, although you could be fighting harder beings that would actually increase your skill in combat, you fight because your involvment in their death might prove to other races that you actually have some decency in your heart? *passionately with a disturbing amount of violence in his voice* Do you KNOW what it is like, after hours of slaying these insignifacant creatures, and seeing each one improve your faction bit by bit, to walk back, all the way to that city whom you want to prove your loyalty to, and to look upon the guards, look upon the beautiful mouments, look upon the people that you wish with all your heart to one day consider your friends.... (breathing heavily and pauses for a second)... and see, the same sadistic, cruel, hate-filled scowl they greated you with the day they first laid eyes upon you? *last phrase said in a loathesome seething whisper. His body quivers as the hatred and fear fumigates out from his soul in an almost uncanny phyical gaslike aura that fills the whole room with the stench of pain and suffering. Breathing is very very deep, and this time pauses to catch his breath* If you dont know, what IT IS LIKE, then HOW can you know what TRUE happiness is?!?! *eyes look crazed, like that of a man on the brink of insanity, so close to edge. So wanting to jump off, so wanting to hold on, and so torn by such opposite feelings that he is stuck on that edge not having any clue what to do about it* Ha, ha, by now.. you're probably wondering, what is he talking about. Probably wondering, where is his point? *voice now sounds more crazed than his eyes look. long pause* Well, if you're wondering how i can make this relate, this is my point.<br>
You people might know happiness, you people might have victory after victory, making you feel all the more confident and self-assured. You might have friends that you care about... But...*has calmed down a reasonable amount although some loathing can still be detected in his voice* how hard was it for you to obtain those things. Did your parents not love and nurture you, feed and support you when you were young? Did you not have friends to help you out when you were just first starting to learn the basics of combat for your own class? Were your victoriess not handed to you on a silver platter by the kingtoms and towns you served? Sure, with all these things, you have happiness alright, you probably have felt a lot of happiness in your life. But, I never said anything ahout happiness, no, my question was about TRUE happiness. *breathing is almost back to normal, eyes and voice are are back to their original state* <br>
Well... I never had any of that. From birth us Iksar are told that we were hatched, no parents of any kind nuzzled me closely to thier chest. I have always wondered about that. I have alwasy thought that somehow, to &quot;distiguish&quot; ourselves from the other races (or to give us reason to beleive we are better, whathaveyou) they merely claim this, and keep the identities of those who bore us a secret. I therefore have always been a little untrustworthy of anyone in authority. I would always question things, especially things i wasnt supposed to. This caused those above me in authority to look down upon me a little, and being impressionable as young ones are, my peers started to do the same. So, when everyone went out for the first time into the &quot;playgrounds&quot;, where all the weak creatures live to be killed by young ones, although others did have friends, mine unfortunately were few and far between. I have been alone at birth, alone in younger years, and alone now, scoffed at by people I have never seen or known before. And as for victories, admittingly, I have had more defeats than I desire, for it is hard to win all by onesself. <br>
What do you know about true happiness? Its been with you since your day of birth, you never had to do anything, never put any effort into it... Is that true happiness? However, everytime I look death in the face in a close battle, everytime I have to pretend that I am dead just so a passing beast that attacks me out of nowhere will leave me be, everytime I feel the cold blade of a sword belonging to a race other than my own slice into my being, I still get up. I could wollow in my own pity, I could beg my authority figures to forgive me of my unwillingness to bow to them, I could stay on kunark like some of my weakhearted brothers and deny that the adventure seeking side of me exists. But I Dont! Despite every failure and everytime my face is shoved into the dirt, I get up again and refuse to let this keep me from happiness. With all this I have to find happiness, its not spoonfed to me by my parents or anyone else, I search it out and even when I come upon its opposite, i refuse to beleive it is only for those who are luckier than me. I have to WORK AT IT, I have to find it FOR MYSELF, I have to persevere each and everytime i am smacked down by something more skilled then I am. That, my dear friends, is what I mean, by True happiness…. <br>
So tell me… do you, know what true happiness is…..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uwarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lost One </span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#CC9900>(10/4/00 9:21:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Depths of Bitterness</span><hr size=1> you have a good story here Azmodian.  <br>

well, ive havent really made up much after this, but I have some ideas, ill keep that in mind though next time I write )<br>
