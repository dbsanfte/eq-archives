<br>
locking interesting topics where debate is happening is pretty lame in my opinion. it sure beats the &quot;grats me on item X&quot; threads.<br>
<br>
what's wrong with debating various features in everquest? seems like the whole reason to have a message board in the first place.<br>
<br>
just like server boards, I find PoN to contain about 5% interesting/relevant discussion and 95% useless crap. I realized a board is nothing more than it's users, but when you start locking that 5% just because some guy gets his panties in a bunch, you're really just messing up a good thing. I've seen it happen here before, and it just happened again.<br>
<br>
anyways, I don't think I'll be visiting here anymore. it's sad when you can learn more about your class and have much more interesting and relevant converstations on the rogue board than you can on your own class board...but I guess that's the way it is.<br>
<br>

"I will make fun of any players who go to the legends server and most likely refer to them as "sellouts" or something of the like"<br>
<br>
"like tig said in his update, "And as a friendly reminder -- to all you moving to the Legends server -- please keep in mind: We're laughing AT you, not with you"<br>
<br>
true words...and trust me, we WILL be laughing"<br>
<br>
"make up whatever excuse you need to make yourself feel better about selling out the rest of us. send me as many emails where you OWN the caps lock button as you need, but the fact is the "legends" server is a joke, and anyone who plays on it is too. I, for one, will be making fun of you gimps as long as I'm involved with EQ."<br>

There was a time when I actually liked this board but nowdays it's just filled with crap, and I tend to use Safehouse alot more than my own class board for information regarding tanking/spells/equipment/AA's/campspots etc etc...<br>
<br>
Another sad pathern I've seen is the personal insults and the mindless flames. It doesn't belong to these boards imo (I bet I've used a couple myself) and this is where moderators should take their power and edit/remove some from a post and even permban perhaps?<br>
<br>
EDIT: the post above mine is totally disrespectful and the writer should get a warning imo<br>

Perhaps because you're not smart enough to make five times that amount per hour like I do.  Trying to prove that you're intelligent because you make $80 an hour is laughable.  I represent plenty of stupid millionaires, so hearing someone say "I is smart beecuz I makes $X" is thoroughly unimpressive.  At least to me.  Maybe it's impressive to some burnt-out barfly golddigger.  There is always someone out there who has a bigger bank account, unless, of course, you're Bill Gates.<br>
<br>
Now, if you were to say something like "I'm going to the Legends server because $40 per month for the offered content is a price I am willing to pay for the entertainment I believe I would derive," most of us can respect that, even though a lot of people would think you're crazy.  Frankly, I don't care how you spend your money.  It's yours.  Just don't blow a gasket when someone opines differently.<br>
<br>
As for everyone else calling his ilk stupid, please STFU.  Tell you what to do as an object lesson: go out on the street and tell everyone you meet that you pay $10 a month play a MMORPG, that you spend countless hours raiding and camping rare "spawns" so that you can "loot" neato items, and that you debate over whether to pay more money to do the same on an elite server.  I'm certain a few of the people you meet would start looking for a net.<br>
<br>
There.  Have I not censured everyone in some fashion yet?  How about we all try to find something useful to discuss--you know, like we used to do?  Rant if you like; scream at Verant.  Just try to be civil with each other.  You're all driving the rest of us nuts with the flames and other BS.  Or you can flame me if you really need to direct your invective and vitriol at someone.<br>
<br>
Yes, I did get personal in this thread.  It was a calculated decision, and I don't plan on doing it again.  But it does bother a lot of us who have actually been around this board for a couple of years to see it going in a very different direction than its original course.  Please find something better to discuss and debate.  If you want to flame, go someplace else. <p>That which does not kill you will probably make you wish that it had.<BR>

If we curtailed these sorts of posts and kept PON relevant to Paladin info that matters, this could be a great board again. Monkly Business has been getting beaten up because they have succumbed to this kind of drivel, and we're no better. PON used to be a great place to come to discuss Paladin issues. ISSUES. Now it's a haven for newbies and wannabes who don't want to figure @#%$ out for themselves.  <p><b><a href="http://www.serenity-within.com/View_Member.php?Name=Aelodyn" target="_blank">Aelodyn Autumnflame</a><br>Knight of Tunare<br><a href="http://www.serenity-within.com/" target="_blank">Serenity Within</a><br>The Nameless</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uekimemsti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ekimemsti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 139<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 7:26:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/hayesm/mini_icon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: my views of this board</span><hr size=1> I've been coming to PON website/boards for a 1.5 years<br>
and I believe I've only seen 2-3 flames (guess who<br>
has the last one).  Some points I'd like to make <br>
about this board imho.  One, yes their not much high<br>
end talk, why, I believe the majority of visitors<br>
are 55 and under.  Two, A lot of newbie Paladins<br>
come here seeking help as I once did (and sometimes<br>
still do), this includes mindless re-posts, duplicate<br>
threads,etc,etc.  But to them these are new problems<br>
and questions, and I personally love helping them<br>
(In a true Paladin manner).<br>
<br>
I read the post on the Lengends server, and I think it<br>
should have been closed once &quot;someone&quot; soured the post<br>
with mindless flaming.  If you look on almost ever<br>
EQ web board, their is a Lengends thread about 5+ pages,<br>
no point complaining because one more was closed!  How<br>
many threads on these boards are honestly closed...less<br>
than 1% ...why, most Paladins post in a noble manner.<br>
<br>
On a final note, I really respect people who post on<br>
ways to fix issues or ask if they can help bring a <br>
certain new element to something they value (or use to).<br>
Flaming, and complaining is a close minded approach.<br>
I was so disapointed in reading your post(s) Voronwe, <br>
please feel free to surprise me with a flameless, <br>
constructive reply.<br>

As the saying goes, &quot;Laugh alone and the world thinks your an idiot.&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kassel>kassel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 8:40:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> In regards to the post</span><hr size=1> about things I hate like:<br>
<br>
newbies and wannabe's (that whole line)<br>
<br>
Some of us are tired of looking at sites that aren't class specific.<br>
<br>
I read eqatlas about 3/4 of the weapons and equipment  and there are no prices or drop info....so I ask here<br>
<br>
I look at 99% of the sites and they don't have updated Luclin info.<br>
<br>
When I play the game I will sit and chat with a lower player whenever asked to....thats what makes for a good friend.<br>
<br>
I am only 43 ...so who do I ask?<br>
<br>
You........the upper levels of this fine class.<br>
<br>
I am choosing to stop that as of today. the last thing I would want is to put anyone out by asking any question so far beneath your god like status.<br>

Yes, a lot of the stuff you read is repetitious, however I believe that has a lot to do with so many new people around. I still consider myself fairly new to these boards, and I have plenty of posts under my belt.<br>
<br>
If those things listed are the only thing you believe you are getting out of PoN, then I strongly recommend you check out the rest of the folders! The Role playing board has lots of unique threads, which aren't exactly my cup of tea, so I just skim through and move on. Perhaps the General board isn't to your temperment and/or tastes, there's still plenty of others available.<br>
<br>
And lastly, if there isn't a thread discussing what you think is appropriate or interesting, why not start that thread? Why not offer a discussion on what you deem worthy of your time? Can't complain it doesn't exist until you're willing to take the time to make it happen...<br>
<br>
You get out what you put in...<br>

<br>
Quite truthfully to be a paladin is about deeds and the most famous and respected paladins are not known because they have such and such uber armour or such and such uber weapon instead their words live on in the minds of those they have helped or influenced over the time spent here and in game.<br>

Some of us might be laughing at the folks that move to the Legends server, but we're not that much different from them. We pay $10 a month to play a game. Some of us brag about having multiple accounts and being able to play 3 computers at one time, powerleveling ourselves 100 AA points over the course of a month. Some of us put in free time + overtime to kill as many boss mobs as we can on patch day, ignoring everything else around us. Some of us work our sleep and schedules around the Stormfeather spawn. We spend hours pouring over Allakhazam data so we can make Magelo dream setups. We have read more EQ message boards than all the books we read in a lifetime, and write to these boards more than all the writing we did in school. If it wasn't for gaming, is there really a reason to be shelling out $40-60 a month for broadband service? $250-1000 every year to upgrade our PCs to meet gaming specs? Lookd at your /played time lately and how that could've been applied to other hobbies or to the pursuit of unpixelated wealth?<br>
<br>
So, should we still be laughing at those who go to Legends?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Equipment check!&quot;<br>
Those topics seem relevant to me. Maybe these players aren't the ones that spend hours studying Allakhazams like it was Finals Week. They're important questions for the maturing Paladin that's gearing himself up to better benefit himself, his group, and his guild. We were once in their shoes too, you know. Keep those questions coming.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where should I hunt?&quot;<br>
Again, seems relevant and important to me. Played out? Sure it is. But there are always new and/or naive Paladins coming into Norrath. Keep those questions coming.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grats me on item X!&quot;<br>
Self-serving. Unless it's a Holy Sword, why not let someone else congratulate you if it's really all that special?<br>
<br>
&quot;What's your AC/hp/mana/Stats/cup size/ego diameter?&quot;<br>
Self-serving. The main reason I don't do Magelo-type links or reply to these topics. <p>- Replay Promisekeeper, Crusader</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ureplay.showPublicProfile?language=EN>replay</A> at: 2/10/02 10:06:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=quiksilverroxdasox>Quiksilver Roxdasox</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 10:16:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> the board has detereiated but have fun i could care less that you will no longer read it. its kind of like when people announce that they are putting other people on their ignore list, they feel its some kind of boost to their personal ego. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugladoitor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladoitor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/10/02 10:23:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Gladoitor/thumbnails/EQ000030.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> All newbies should leave and come back when they got over a years worth of time in EQ?
