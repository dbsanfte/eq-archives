It was just a question I had.  I had no intention to start a big discussion, sorry.  Also, this may ramble a bit.  I’ll try not to wander too much.  I will also bring up points that represent what some folks have said in the past without giving names.  I’m talking about these points and not about the folks behind them.  Those are two very different topics; and I don’t bash people.  Lastly, I’m not trying to convert anyone, just expressing some views for others to think on.<br>
<br>
Where to begin…<br>
<br>
History…To my knowledge, when Brell was young in it’s raiding days, only a handful of guilds were capable of these feats.  Most communication was handled in game between these guilds and the world was good.  As time progressed, it was decided that a better forum was needed to communicate and to better organize the sharing of these “resources” and this led to the creation of the Brell site.  (.ed  I really hate seeing folks call the mobs and their loot resources.  It just feels wrong to me.)  A calendar was placed on the Brell site for scheduling raids and to provide a reference for planning guild events.  Over time, as more and more players became raid capable (by level) and more guilds were created, players were actually directed to the Brell site to organize and plan their raids.<br>
<br>
Here is where my understanding of history differs from what some folks are now saying.  People say this site was never intended to function this way.  It was only created for a few guilds to communicate.  This can not be true.  Once I became raid fodder, I was told by several folks to start visiting the Brell site to raid.  While it’s true that some folks are still unaware of this site, this site has become “the place” to communicate and plan raids.  If it was truly intended for the use of a few guilds, it should have been locked down and the rotations never started in a public forum; an dplayer should not of been encouraged to go to the site.<br>
<br>
Today…Our server population has finally reached a saturation point in regards to raiding certain mobs.  Brell has been in existence long enough for a lot of folks to have more than one alt who is raid capable..  Competition for items and quest junk has escalated to the point of frustrating most of the player base to some degree or another.  There is no “end game” to EQ.  There are only two ways to distinguish yourself in this world; 1. Level, and 2. Gear.  Because of this, Verant controls the rate at which items enter the game through spawn times and loot tables.  This is where the competition in the game comes from for most folks.  When you look back on “epic” encounters, they are not truly that challenging.  (To me, anything that fights the same way every time is not a challenge.  It’s more of a puzzle.)<br>
<br>
Finger Pointing…With rotations being stretched and doomsayers raising their voices, change is being forced upon the community.  Some folks point to the IROs as the source of evil.  It’s not.  On the three (3) current rotations, there are a total of eight (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  IROs, hardly a fraction of the total number of slots taken.  However, one IRO is currently on two (2) lists and should be dropped from one list.  The biggest problem comes from the number of guilds which are created each week for all the alts.  This is the way that the rotations are being abused, not by IROs.  But then it comes to how you view characters in the game.  Do you view the character as the individual or the player behind the characters as the individual?  ( I view each character as an individual.  Though some folks abuse the use of their alts in the game.)  There are few honest folks in this game, imho.  Everyone has their own agenda and will bend things for their own ends.  (My agenda is to finish my epic.)<br>
<br>
Just where the heck is she going?<br>
<br>
Well, I realize there is a lot of this game that I’ll never see.  I’m basically a social gnat, but it’s my own fault.  (No, not looking for pity.  It’s going somewhere, honest.)  I used to think that the rotation system would be the only way I would ever have a chance at seeing some of the encounters.  But the server is just too crowded now.  Everyone and their brother has an alt now which further crowds the server.  Due to this fact alone, the rotations will no longer work.  It kind of hurts to say this, but the server should just turn FCFS.  All the lists should be dropped.  However, I do strongly feel that a definition of FCFS should be agreed upon.  The main sticking point would be the definition of the first to arrive there in force.  Define “in force.”  The planes should still be scheduled though, but the two  (2) week limit should be raised to three (3) weeks.  <br>
<br>
There is no solution for the rotation list.  Removing IROs does nothing.  Forcing guilds to co-host will not be agreed to.  No one likes to do the paper work involved in validating her/his raid.  I honestly think there is no solution when you really look at it.<br>
<br>
Sit back for a couple of days and think on it.  Yes, FCFS does have it’s problems with potential farming.  You just have to come to the realization that you will not get everything that you want.  (hehe..I am 56 and still see twinks with better gear than me.)  With FCFS, we’ll just have to rely on folks talking in game to work stuff out on conflicts.  I just hope that some folks will still feel inclined to share.<br>

<br>
The current system is only as fair as the people using it are.  <br>
<br>
While many of the users of the system DO use it appropriately, a significant percentage do NOT use it appropriately.<br>
<br>
Any system of reform we put in place (limiting Indy's, making guilds double up for raids, etc) tends to punish the people that will FOLLOW that reform... the people exploiting will simply continue to exploit.<br>
<br>
The system is unenforcable.  Banning exploiters will only enourage them to completely ignore the system.  Reform punishes the people not exploiting... thus eventually encouraging THEM to not use the system.<br>
<br>
Brell is 19 months old (or thereabouts)... over that time most of the playerbase has brought at least one character in raidworthy level range.  The fastest levelers have done it several times over.  The result is that at most times playing over 1/3 of the population is in a level range contending for the resources we 'reserve.'  The number of Independants, small guilds, uber guilds, European players, Asian players, American players isnt the problem... the number of players times the number of months divided by the number of resources IS the problem.<br>
<br>
There is no method for reforming this system that gives a fair shake to the large guilds, small guilds, Indy's, Europeans, Asians, Americans, etc. playing this game.  Any series of reforms asks one of those groups to suffer a lack of opportunity for the benefit of another group... that wouldn't be a problem if the notion involved shared sacrifice and shared opportunity, but it doesn't...<br>
<br>
The majority of our dungeons are FCFS.  The majority of our dungeons cause NO problems in playstyle.  A small percentage of our resources (sorry, its the only word that fits) ARE reservable.  These reservable resources cause almost 100% of the problems.<br>
<br>
There are too many upper levels and too many resources for one or two 'uberguilds' to dominate a server as was the case on many servers in old Norrath (pre-Kunark).  However, there are too many upperlevels and too few resources for a simple rotation system to work.  More landmass is coming which will help, and a server split MIGHT be coming which will help further... that said, there isn't really a benefit to reservations or rotations any longer.<br>
<br>
Reforming the system will likely only hasten its demise.  Doing nothing to the system will likely hasten its demise.  I'd venture that allowing for its demise and figuring out how to civily go about the new disorder would be prudent.<br>
<br>
Personally... drop the dragon rotation... drop the planar reservations.  Let people organize and play the game.  There is now plenty of items and zones for the small to midsize player to get a fair shake.  Organizing isn't hard.  Maybe we should just put the old system away.<br>

<br>
By the way, simple definition of &quot;in force&quot;=You have enough or very nearly enough to kill the mob, with the rest of your group on the way, and will be proceeding to the staging area for the mob within a SHORT period of time, like 10 minutes max. <br>
<br>
i.e. if you have 27 people sitting around waiting for a couple folks to arrive for a trakanon raid and I show up with a ready group of 30 people, we should yield to you, since you basically have a raid ready group, and could probably have sent down a CoH group already while you waited for the last couple players. <br>
<br>
If I walk into the zone with those 30, see you sitting there with 15 other people and hear you ooc &quot;looking for more for Trak raid&quot; I'm gonna walk by you and kill him. No matter how many people you have there, because it indicates to me you aren't ready, and I am. <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

There is a third way one distinguishes oneself in this game, and it is in my small opinion more important than one's Level or one's Gear.  It is a player's reputaion.<br>

They really aren't that bad.  I've not seen or heard any real issues going on with the Planes other than a few Indies or small guilds getting wiped or cancelling and cause problems.  But in general the Planar system works well imo.  Adune does a great job at keeping it fair and orderly.  While you may not get the Saturday you wanted almost anyone can get a date at some point during the month.  Alot of guilds seem to have stopped going to Hate/Fear and are concentrating on PoG/Kael and other areas lately.<br>
<br>
I think Vox and Nagafen should definately be removed.  Trakanon is kinda iffy.  There aren't that many on the list atm but I would see Trak being removed eventually as well.<br>

Note... the Plane system does work.  Adun does a great job with it.  I can and have used the system both as a guest and recently as a leader for raids.  However:<br>
<br>
- Talk to the European Guilds or Asian Guilds for whom every raid reservation carries the reality of a partially popped (or worse a potentially fully depopped zone) based simply on a timescale problem.  Yes, we try to keep it from happening and yes, they represent a 'smaller' portion of the playerbase (and do benefit from the timezone difference in other ways).  But... it's a problem, small/large/indifferent is a matter of perspective.<br>
<br>
- Hate second floor.  Not even close to well utilized during the week and requiring most weekend raids to live (as in do a 10 hour minimum raid) in the plane to get there for a day.  Again, not specifically a problem, more a side effect of our system.<br>
<br>
- Fear Gods.  Silent Redemption can do CT.  Watchers can do CT.  Enshadowed probably can... not sure about who else can.  Those three guilds have close to zero use for the planes themselves.  There's a pretty good split opinion right now between folks who think it's perfectly fine for SR, Watchers, etc. to tail after a scheduled raid (which I'm good with) and folks thinking its downright wrong for them to do so and that they should reserve the plane just like everyone else (which to me seems like a hellacious waste of a plane for one god).<br>
<br>
- Two week rule.  There's a lot of talk about three weeks, maybe only one reservation for the two main planes in a two week period, etc.  Its that way because the Planes are as crowded as the Dragons... we just manage to keep a blinder on the 'backlog' because we cut off the list at 14 (two weeks).  A similar approach to Dragons might work (cut Dragon list off at four guilds/raids), but then again... that's an arbitrary change... so is FCFS/FFA...<br>
<br>
Had the planes not been tweaked recently, odds are things would have sorted themselves out exactly like you're saying Twiggie... people would have moved on to Velious or Kunark since planar armor is pretty passe post level 53(ish)... but now the planes are tweaked and the 55+ crowd wants, needs, and frankly are the only ones who can use parts of a zone really built for the 46-53 range (well 46-50 once upon a day...).<br>
<br>
Realistically, the Planes have an aweful lot in common with Fire Giants now.  They (1) represent a resource that has 'needs' for the &gt;55 crowd AND the below 55 crowd (2) the stuff for the 55+ crowd cant' really be accessed until the 55- content is somewhat dealt with, (3) I'm pretty sure a well tuned team or two teams of 55-60 could handle the bulk of most of Hate or Fear, (4) the nature of the items the 55- MoBs drop make it impractical for the 55+ groups to waste time on (most are so far past their planar armor it isn't funny), and (5) Epic pieces are involved (granted, clerics get a special nod because...well they're clerics and... that cleric epic is the most community and team friendly item ever made).  <br>
<br>
As a server we've not looked at the Planes as similar, but they are.  While I'm pretty sure the notion of a FCFS/FFA Plane is too extreme right now for Brell Serilis, the notion of it isn't THAT extreme in general terms... we're just not there... yet.<br>

I don't really see a problem with Fear if everyone (or at least almost everyone) finds this acceptable.<br>
<br>
Hate, on the other hand, has plenty of upper 50 content.  Perhaps we can rediscuss splitting Hate into two different reservations per day (first floor/second floor reservations). I think there are already some guilds skipping parts of the first floor just so they can do the second.<br>
<br>
Perhaps an experiment should be run in game to see if we can have two different raiding parties each working on a different floor.  Find a guild during the week that is only going to do the first floor, have them clear enough of the first floor so raiders can get up to the second floor, and have the second raid go up there (first floor would continue their raid, of course).  It would help provide evidence as to how many people can be there at once, and if there are any special precautions that need to be taken when there are two raiding parties there.<br>
<br>
I suspect that two raiding parties of 30-36 people each could work in Hate without massive linkdeaths (as long as people are using /serverfilter and all the other anti-LD settings available).<br>
<br>
Also, even though I don't like the idea of FCFS for the planes, I think we should also attempt to put multiple 12-18 person mini-raids up in Hate in different areas of the first floor to see if it is viable to have people &quot;camp the planes&quot;, as might happen if the planes went FCFS.<br>

<br>
I know one of the 'guides' I've looked over frm the Safespot (post patch guide) advises starting somewhere up in the NE part of First Floor.  If that's feasible (and the writer of that guide allegedly is pretty credible) then a NE corner raid and a portal room start could easily happen simultaneously... some logistics for starting would likely need to be addressed.<br>
<br>
Monday through Thursday Hate is underutilized.<br>
<br>
Fear is a bit of a trickier mess and I'm going to have to spend more time there where I'm actually thinking about a different system (besides thinking about how to do this raid) before I could provide any feedback on it.<br>
