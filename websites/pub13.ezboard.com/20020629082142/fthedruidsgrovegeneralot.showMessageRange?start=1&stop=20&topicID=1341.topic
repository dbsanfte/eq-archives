Let's see...<br>
The person is obsessed with EQ<br>
He has trouble telling the difference between EQ and reality<br>
He seems to have absolutely no idea what's going on in real life, as his entire thought processes are focused on EQ<br>
It appears to end as he commits suicide (and, worryingly, wonders whether he will spawn in timorous)<br>

Monday 12, January, 2002<br>
<br>
Today is the day its Monday. Mondays are not bad ... they are just new beginning, a new path to the same old routine that was forgotten during the euphoric weekend. I get up at 11. It s cold. Last January was much warmer, or maybe my blood was colder... Hmm... What am I thinking about? I am not quite sure why those thoughts appear in my head, its like it doesn t require any interaction from me... Thoughts pop on the core of my brain like soap bubbles submerging from the deep because of the lightweight. And like bubbles break the surface they come with pain... I don t know why I writing this, maybe this is last attempt to understand myself since thoughts laid on paper are flat and emotionless. Anyways ... today I will finally replace the light bulb in my room...<br>
<br>
It burned out yesterday or last Sunday, I cant quite remember. I like soft darkness anyways, and today its no exception. <br>
<br>
My computer screen is different though I like to set light to the top and contrast to the higher level. It is much better that way, I even feel that it<br>
<br>
is the computer that lights my room, not the light bulb. I fixed myself a sandwich I am proud that I can still do that. I tried to do that yesterday<br>
<br>
but quit after I saw the fridge light, it was too hard on my eyes. <br>
<br>
Today is the patch day. I have to admit that I feel almost like I am sick waiting for the patch to go through. I need to see my avatar who spent two days without me in small yellow stone room lightened with strange looking candle holders and with windows with only clouds after them. I am almost relieved that he is still there and still fully equipped. He is a druid and his name is Astrobellum. We are going to camp Bilge.<br>
<br>
Tuesday 13, January, 2002<br>
<br>
Today is Tuesday, I woke up early at 7 and couldn t sleep. Strange thoughts came to me in a dream, I can t remember what they were but I still feel them hiding somewhere on the crossroads of dream and reality. I had a dream ... I was running from something, but left foot was shorter then the right one, and it was hard to run... My left eye hurts... it is that annoying pulsating dull pain. <br>
<br>
After expecting it in the mirror I cant tell the difference between the right and the left eye, it seems fine to me... it shouldn t hurt. Pain doesn t matter, someplace I had Tylenol... <br>
<br>
It is almost 8 and time to go to work. I put my sunglasses on like I always do when I leave. Ride to work is always fun, it is traffic time and I have to take a shortcut through the nearby woods. The road is old, some even won t called it a road. Everything is covered with soft shadows and sun cant shine down through the thick layer of leaves. I put in a CD with sounds from Kitchkor forest and ride on.<br>
<br>
I think I am fired. Mr. Watchman called me in his office and was talking and talking and talking. I am not sure what he was saying, his office is decorated with wooden panels that resemble the Mermaid s Bait walls It is almost funny.<br>
<br>
After 10 minutes he was yelling something about the responsibility, loyalty and attendance? I told him that I send him a tell yesterday since I couldn t came, Astrobellum needed my help and I can t say no since he is my avatar. Pain returns to my left eye. I fell the dull pulsating again. This might be a strange observation but when Mr. Watchman raise his voice it start to pulsate much quicker. Mr. Watchman is pretty old, I would say he is about 60? I think people don t live longer then that or was that changed? Anyways ... I smiled and told him that I am living for a day. He told me that when he was 17 young people had some respect and also he said that I shouldn't come back. <br>
<br>
It is around 3 and I am still looking for my car on the parking lot. I finally found my car it was parked on the lawn behind the building... That s funny ... I don t remember doing that. The pain is much worse now. I think it is triggered by that bright pink parking citation on my windshield. YES! I think I broke my windshield... My hands are bleeding, windshield is broken, peaces of citation are mixed with broken glass and blood drops on the lawn. Red looks good on green, pink doesn t belong there. My eye doesn t hurt. <br>
<br>
Finally I am back home. And no I didn t forget, I bought a new light bulb for my room, a nightlight bulb. I log back on. I think I saw Astrobellum smile at me when I logged. We are camping Bilge. Few tidals wander buy just to be killed by Astrobellum, it is always like that stop them from running away, let the roots grub their feet and then burn them till they fall. I like doing that. They don t drop much about 5-10 plat a peace. But that is fine we killed ton of them. And I hope that that would be enough to pay the rent this month since I am now unemployed. <br>
<br>
Wednesday 14, January, 2002<br>
<br>
I woke up at 7 again. My left eye hurts. I went to the bathroom and start to wash my face with cold water. Someone told me that it helps. It doesn t now my hands hurt. Sink looks funny red on white ... My hands start to bleed. It looks like I need some stitches on my right hand. Left is fine, few cuts not so deep, with funny looking peaces of glass sticking out of the forearm. I think I need bandages. But that could wait my eye hurts worse then my hands. I took my bat and drive back to work. It is dark in the Kitchkor woods today. The sun is covered by clouds and it rains. Thunder claps every few minutes and it seems like it does so in unison with pain in my arms. This is funny I never noticed that my windshield is cracked in few places and there are peaces of the glass on the dashboard. <br>
<br>
I think I ran over something. When I stopped the car I found a dog or was it a coyote? It laid down near the bushes whining and trying to lick its back. That looks pretty funny. I bowed down to pet it and it bit me! The stupid bitch bitted me! I return to the car and took the bat. It seems that the dog is almost dead so it shouldn t take long. And since it doesn t move that shouldn't be hard at all. I am not good at melee but ... Wow I dint know that it takes about 5 minute to finish off a wolf. Astrobellum can do that in about one. The bloody mess still makes some whining sounds and it looks like it still breathe. <br>
<br>
Now I know I was going somewhere... I am not sure where though. It would make sense that I am going to work, but I think I was fired? Oh yes! It makes perfect sense now I was hunting. I have a feeling that I forgot something. It took me about 10 minutes to loot the fang of the wolf that I just slayed. I turned around and droved back home.<br>
<br>
I haven t noticed how messed my room was. Now when I have a nightlight bulb I can see the mess. First I need to wipe those stains on my desk. I don t have any cloth though. I wiped my desk with a peace of paper that said DIPLOMA ...<br>
<br>
strange word. I remember it was hanging on the wall in front of my computer. Who s is it anyways? Astrobellum s ? It think that s what they called me back in school ... in Latin class. I think I know Latin... or maybe I did? I am pretty sure I know Common, Tier Dal, and some Barbarian. Anyways I think Astrobellum is waiting for me. Today we will camp Bilge again. He has to die. Hmm... I feel a little dizzy. I almost forgot! I was bitten for some amount of damage... Where did I leave my bandages? My eye doesn t hurt anymore but all around is turning into blur. <br>
<br>
Thursday, January, 2002<br>
<br>
It is almost 4. I am not sure if its still night or day. Did I pass out couple of hours ago or was it days? I fell a feverish. I need a drink, water is always hard to forage. <br>
<br>
I found plenty of water in the sink and I drank. I feel much better now. It's time to go back to Bilge. I believe he is still hiding somewhere and its just a matter of patience. Astrobellum smiles at me again and welcomes me back. This is going to be a boring camp. Tidals are scared of me now and try to avoid me. <br>
<br>
I hate sports but I started to swim. I heard that practice swimming is a way to go, since there are a lot of places where I cant hunt underwater. This is funny I hear the sound of waves but I don t feel the water... We are swimming around and killing fish. Astrobellum told me that he needs a fish scale to breath I found that silly since I can breathe just fine.<br>
<br>
The dull pulsating pain returns. Now the bite marks hurt too... it feels like someone is slowly chewing on my hand... I think I need to find some bandages. On the second though it should regenerate in couple of minutes, I got chrolo on.<br>
<br>
It is 9 and I feel hungry. It looks like it doesn t matter that I ate about 6 roots I am still hungry. Astrobellum never tried pizza. He told that to me yesterday. I decide to give that a shot. <br>
<br>
It is still raining outside. I hear the raindrops on my roof. I called for pizza. Delivery guy is short and hairy with oversized dirty feet. I feel like I saw him before in Rivervale, but I cant be sure. I gave him 15 plat for the pizza as he requested and also tried to sell him the fang I looted on<br>
<br>
Wednesday. He looked at me funny and run to his car. I think I need to raise the faction somehow before I can do that. Maybe ordering more pizzas would help?<br>
<br>
Bilge still haven t showed up. We are waiting by the fire with few other campers they are the strangest bunch I ever saw. A pale thin teenager with red hair, bearded midget and two others I cant quite remember. I asked red hair to heal me but he just laughed in response. Astrobellum start to discuss some middle east crisis with me again.<br>

Friday, January, 2002<br>
<br>
I saw a dream today and I remember it well. I was living in the underwater cave, about 20 feet below the surface where sun never shines and everything is hidden in soft shadows. My cave gloves tenderly and I spent most of the time looking at the huge pearl that shows me a life in a different place, life in qeynos, surefall glade and Freeport. At night I see the latest news from Neriak city and laugh at stupidity of Blackburrow gnolls who live and multiply just to be killed by a bunch of bloodthirsty kids. My name is Bilge and I love my cave but something forcing me out, maybe its blood of my relatives that color the water red or maybe its my destiny. I come to the surface and with the first breath of fresh air I realize that I cant move... My left hand begin to burn and flame jumps to my head, burning out my left eye and vaporizing my skin. My name<br>
<br>
is Bilge and I am dying. <br>
<br>
I am angry at Astrobellum he never told me how painful it is to die burning in roots.<br>
<br>
I think I hear some noise in the living room. When I came to investigate all I saw was a flash of green skin and blue hair by the TV.<br>
<br>
January 2002<br>
<br>
This time I am prepared I set traps all over my apartment for Bilge. He won't get to me without me knowing that. I saw him again couple of times, even chased him around the apartment for 10 minutes non stop.<br>
<br>
January 2002<br>
<br>
My left hand still burns. I feel it even through the shirt that I am wearing.<br>
<br>
The bite marks still bleed, but not much and only when I scratch them... it itches a lot. Bilge suddenly disappear from my apartment. My eye hurts again, I am out of Tylonol. I still hear Bilge s laugh.<br>
<br>
Monday, 2002<br>
<br>
Today is the day its Monday. Mondays are not bad ... I haven t gotten much sleep yesterday since I was hunting the stonegrabbers on the Luclin. I don't completely understand why I need to sleep Astrobellum just sits down in front of book and he is fine for the rest of the day. I hunted good today. I got couple of strange marks and even a petrified totem from one of the stonegrabbers, I am not quite sure what to do with those, but they do look valuable. I also killed a lot of lightcrawlewrs those critters remind me of some insects I tried to kill yesterday in my living room. I used bat so everything is pretty much crashed there. I hate them! I just go into rage when I see those ugly tiny bodies crawling on my floor eating my food.<br>
<br>
Wednesday, of August, of the year 2175<br>
<br>
I died yesterday! My body is someplace in between the Tmomorous deep and oasis. I was trying to talk to the GMs but they just laugh at me. Bilge called and asked why I haven t visited him for so long. I hate Bilge! I broke my phone into peaces... GM say that they will not help me get my body back. There is last chance I have to find Bilge. I got his phone from the caller ID today, but he wont answer. Life seems so meaningless now. <br>
<br>
Monday<br>
<br>
I finally decided to do it. I know that I am binded some place in Timorous. And since I am below 10 I should be fine. I fill my bathtub with hot water. This is so relaxing, bitemarks on the left arm still bleed and smell pretty bad. Last time I repeat the instructions from some old book I read - not to cut sideways but from the top to the bottom and then from left to the right. Some say that before the death a man will feel a short moment of ecstasy when the blood and hot water mix. I hope I spawn in Timorous.<br>
