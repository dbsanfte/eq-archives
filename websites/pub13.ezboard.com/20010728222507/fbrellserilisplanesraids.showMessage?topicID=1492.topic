Is it the first person to post for the reservation that day that gets it?  Because most of the reservations I see, are within 5 seconds of the beginning of day they can sign up for that date.  I would be very disappointed in the reservation system if this was so.  I can not and will not wait till 2am (im 2 hours ahead of this message board time) to sign up for a raid, and probably be beaten by some guy that posted his intention 1 second earlier.  Some people have school or work to goto the next morning and can't sit on the computer all hours of the night to reserve for a raid.  I feel all posted reservations for the first day you can post on a date, should be considered, not just the ones that are posted the second the day starts.  Example: Hate for 4/14/01<br>
someone posted at 3/30/01 12:00:03am<br>
another posted at 3/30/01 12:00:08am<br>
on the 2nd person who was 5 seconds slower, the admin, adun, posted &quot;5 seconds to late...&quot; and locked that post.  So from the way it sounds, that person stayed up late enough to actually post that, and was pretty much told to sod off cause some other guy posted 5 seconds earlier.  /rant off<br>

And to reply to your post Syphin:<br>
If you read my post while even half awake, you would have noticed I said the following(quoted from original post):<br>
&quot;I feel all posted reservations for the first day you can post on a date, should be considered, not just the ones that are posted the second the day starts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since you can only sign up for days within the next 2 weeks heres what I meant. Example:<br>
Joe signs up for '5/15 Hate raid' on 5/1 12:00:04<br>
Sam signs up for '5/15 Hate raid' on 5/1 14:06:25<br>
Tom signs up for '5/15 Hate raid' on 5/1 17:42:15<br>
Mel signs up for '5/15 Hate raid' on 5/2 16:23:52<br>
<br>
A good system would be to allow all people that signed up that first day they could sign up to be considered.  i.e. Joe, Sam, and Tom roll for the date, while Mel is not included in the roll because he had 24 hours to sign up and failed to do so.<br>
<br>
Alass, thats not how it is, the people prefer staying up till 2am or later to sign up for their raids.  I hope you enjoy losing out on a date cause you were 2 seconds too slow.<br>

But along with having work the next day, with the planes the way they are now after patching, you cant clear the zone as fast as you used to, making for a really late raid.  Well on weekdays, I, and im sure many others, cant be up past when im supposed to be leaving for work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  And when I'm on a raid, I want to clear the whole damn zone, not put forth a half-assed effort and clear 1/3 of it and give up.  Sigh, looks like I'll just be signing up for other peoples raids.  Hosting one is just unrealistic.<br>

As it stands now, whomever posts first gets the date.  I am sorry you cannot be troubled to post the date early, but frankly that is your problem. If you can figure out a way to decide that is fair, makes sense, and is easy on the mods, by all means do so.  We all would like to improve the system, but as of now, neither you nor anyone else has done this.<br>

I just do not think that allowing all the epople who post on the first day of availability will work in the long run.  People will invariabaly all sign up that day, and instead of the three that you suggest, more than likely 10-15 plane ready guilds and indys will sign up.  The resulting roll off would, I imagine, be a nightmare for the mods and, in addition, not resolve the issue you have brought up.<br>
<br>
Not a bad thought though, not bad.  Just unworkable in my opinion.<br>

Give me a break, 99% of the people on plane raids are there for the loot. Seeing as how I've signed up for about 30 hate raids, and only got on one which was indy lead by person who had never even been to the plane (I'll let your imagination determine how that raid went).  I can't sign up and get on a raid, nor can I post a date for one.  Yea I know, poor me.  It's my problem, and thats how it will stay.  I thought my only fair chance of getting on a raid would be posting for a date, but as I've learned, I can't even do that.

Talk to some raid leaders in game.  You want to go to hate.  Prove yourself to that guild.  Volunteer you time to OTHER raids that don't directly benefit you.  Join them in Fear.

First of Adun, my friend, I respect you.<br>
<br>
The second time I went to the planes, any plane, was a Hate Raid that I lead.  Great raid, good drops, one wipe out wich we recovered in 25 minutes and we took out the pre-buff maestro.<br>
<br>
I have been to the planes 4 times, three of them raids I have lead, all of them succesful.  I think it is beacuse my guild is filled with great people who play well, and I also like to think that my organization helps some.  <br>
<br>
As to Rhazel, it is tough I agree.  But it really is not true that 99% of the people go to the planes only for loot.  That may in fact be one of the reasons you are having problems going to the planes.  You are in it primarily for the loot.  Loot is nice, and I hav eno greater pleasure than seeing someone get a drop, but going with friends is the best reason.  That is why, as a Paladin, I have gone to Hate more than Fear.  In fact I prefer Hate as our guild has more clerics and warriors than any other calss, and so I like to help them and be with them.<br>
<br>
I still like that folks are thinking about ways of making the planes more accesible.  That is good for all of the server.  But I do not think that the system is as fataly flawed as is suggested because a great deal of conflict is resloved with the system we have in place.<br>
<br>
One final note, my raids always inlcude 20-40% non Evoluxan people, including 10% first time raiders/indies who have had a hard time going to the planes for the reasons you have stated.  This is done to help the larger server community experince the planes...so long as people follow my directions exactly.<br>
<br>
The last point is probably worth stating for no particular reasons, on my raids I am the absolute boss.  No questions, no exceptions, and immidiate translocation to anyone who slows the raid down by doing something inexcusably dumb or dangerous.  That may also be why the raids go smooth.<br>

I'm never that concerned about loot, but its always a nice plus.  The one hate raid I have been on I didn't get any planar.  Not a big deal.  Just the idea of being on a plane raid is great fun.  Weather I get loot or not isn't a big deal, but I do like to have a chance at the plane occasionally, which isn't easy to get for me.  Anywho, I'll keep signing up for raids, and just hope I get on.<br>
