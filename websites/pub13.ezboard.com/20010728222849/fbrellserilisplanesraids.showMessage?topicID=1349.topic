First GR's posts are as follows (Edited):<br>
<br>
A. Shal posted .. date already taken<br>
B. Tyia posted PoH .. post too early .. CAN try again <br>
C. Tyia posted PoF .. post too early .. CAN try again <br>
D. Tyia posted PoF .. post OK <br>
<br>
As far as the rules go Tyia's posting like that across two different planes IS VALID.  I posted some rule change suggestions re board camping and other items and was scoffed.  So I asked her to post like this.  /shrug is by the rules.  This was your OWN comment re Twiggie a week ago.  I agree this is not in the spirit (see my other post) but neither is board camping itself and thus will use the rules to the tee. <br>

<br>
Like said, Adun, I don't agree with board camping, nor going against the spirit of the rules, but from my understanding these are the rules.  I will say also that you commented re Twiggies post a week ago, but did not lock it.  Shals post - delete (date taken) .. Tyia's early posts - delete (per rules).  That leaves Tyia's second, and vaild time post, for Fear.<br>

I'll clarify things as soon as I hear from the other mods, but esp Zesty.  I only recently started modding these boards, and I want to do this right.<br>
<br>
When Twiggie posted for Hate, it was done after he lost the Fear date to another person.<br>
<br>
Tyia simultaneously posted for Hate &amp; Fear.  They were both 5 seconds early, but you can understand this could set a precendent.  What do we do when people sign up for both planes simultaneously.  If you had gotten both Hate &amp; Fear, how do we deal with it, etc.<br>
<br>
I promise I'll get back to you as soon as I can on this, but right now I'm waiting to talk to other people. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utamianx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tamianx</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/12/01 2:41:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Adun</span><hr size=1> You are more than welcome, and GR and I will support, changes to how the board is done to help reduce board camping and make it fair for all guilds to be able to host raids on PoF/PoH/PoS and hopefully, when agreed to be scheduled, PoG.  But as far as the rules go today, we are permitted to keep the post.<br>
<br>
As far as if we had been successful in both Fear and Hate, by the rules we would have to give up one.  That plane, I assume, would go to the next person in line.<br>
<br>
The irony in all this is I am, for the most part, a person that is willing to go by the rules of the majority as that keeps the issues down and folks happy for the most part.  But without ramifications, set BEFORE and not AFTER an issue occurs, we will continue to have 4000  rants and people ticked off.  Issues that continue to happen will force FFA, which I WILL NOT SUPPORT.<br>
<br>
Example 1:  We are scheduled for the FG's today at 9PM EST.  No one was posted and we were thrilled.  ET (Lanos) comes in and posts 2 hours after us for a 3PM EST time.  Board rules are 8 hours, that broke them.  Yet they were still in there today and going until 3:30PM, well into the respawn time.  Will something be done .. nope.  His response (can send you a screenshot) was he &quot;did not agree to the rules&quot; and &quot;we are on a different time schedule&quot; and &quot;the Koreans delayed us&quot;.  <br>
<br>
/shrug .. you tell me Adun .. are not the first two a direct slap in everyone's face that use these boards by the rules?  Is not posting for 3PM EST (already in violation of the rules) and blaming going to 3:30 PM EST on the Koreans not a joke?<br>
<br>
Example 2: Bart's Fear raid .. you were there .. you know the details.<br>
<br>
My suggestions to help, for the future (NOT the current):<br>
<br>
A. One post per plane .. period.  That is NOT in the rules stated like that.  If you post early you ARE allowed to repost.<br>
B. One month waiting AFTER getting the plane.  There are at least 30  other Guilds and Indy's trying for these and should be given a fair shot.  Alternate plane posting is fine by me.<br>
C. Exceeding the scheduled time or stepping on anothers raid (example above) removes that guild from all schedules and rotations (maybe intentions as well /shrug), and not permitted to schedule or post for a rotation for a period of time ..  3 months?  Without something that makes it &quot;worthwhile&quot; to follow the rules, they will constantly be broken.<br>

I also was a little tweaked over SOH's hate raid and how it was handled with Freedom Fighters and the mods.  Nothing is in the rules about posting the wrong date in the subject heading with the right date in initial post and then replying to the thread to point out that the subject is wrong..in plenty of time before another guild posts their intent.  It's almost like the mods were going to have us roll or something because we were told to work it out in game.  Work what out?  Pharma posted fair and square and even pointed out the correction for the subject heading 5 hours before FF's even posted.  The only reason there wasn't an issue is because FF realized that pharma did correct it before they posted.  NO rules state anything about this at all whether the subject heading be wrong or what not.  <br>
<br>
Need to go by the rules...that is what they are there for.  I just like to see things followed and done consistently.  If modification needs to happen, it needs to happen appropriately, not because you disagree with it.  I'm not here to put down mods or to imply that they suck...just pointing out the validity of some arguments.  Also about the 2 ppl posting, pharma posts some of the raids, so do I.  I don't think we want to keep a list of acceptable posters from each guild.  I do think for the most part, Zesty has done a great job.  She is also very impartial which is well respected and didn't throw what she thought into the mix.  The thing I would ask yourself is which reservation is valid.  Seems to me the only one that is at the correct time is the one in fear.<br>

Had we gotten both dates, we could of ran both planes. The rules state we are allowed 1 hate raid 1 fear per 2 weeks, it doesn't say they both can't be on the same day.

<br>
If you are refering to my PoF resevation at 12:00:00 as &quot;camping&quot; the board you are mistaken. I came to the board to enlist help in killing Gwan on the 23rd. After that post I looked to see what time it was cause I was getting sleepy. 4 min till 2am. I thought WOW, i could get Fear for CA. So I made the post.<br>
<br>
The rules are the rules and are there for some sort of control over what happens in game. Without these rules you would have 55+ groups up there constantly and the 46 to 50 folks would never get their planer gear. <br>
<br>
As far as camping happening on the board, I think you are looking at this the wrong way. If Circuit City opens at 10 am and you get there 5 till are they gonna open the dorrs early just for you? NOPE. <br>
<br>
There are a great number of guilds on our server that can run planes. Without a set of rules like we have we would have chaos. If we allow a 5 second early post, then we will have to allow a post 5 seconds earlier than that. Where will it stop? If you say no post more that 5 min early, then people will make posts at 11:55:00.<br>
<br>
I feel there is no reason to change any rules and all is well until someone doesnt get what they want. All I can say is Im sorry you missed and better luck next time. <p>Dahli Lama<BR>52 Disciple<BR><img src="http://129.82.121.243/combinealliance/Duas/title.gif" border="0">

<br>
First:<br>
<br>
I am not dumping on ya <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .. just really frustrated today, and you happen to be the moderator of one of the issues I am having to deal with.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't agree with this:<br>
<br>
----------<br>
Heh heh, talk to Zesty. FG's fall under the category of: Not my problem.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
My point about Lanos and his responses are that they are ALL of our problems.  It is attitudes like that which will continue to impact you as well as the rest of us.  I also think it becomes OUR problem to state something in the rules that will make issues like that an offense and have a way to deal with it.  My suggestion to help rectify this impacts the boards you moderate as well.<br>
<br>
ET has a LOT of good people, some I am proud to call my friends.  But when a Guild Leader, who represents the guilds actions, states those things we have problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
Third:<br>
<br>
Where it also becomes your problem is if I got pissed off enough and brought GR up to Fear just prior to ET going (I checked, they are scheduled for tomorrow).  Fear is a 12 hour repop .. oops .. they just have to start later. /shrug .. seemed fine for them to do to us and I am not really taking their &quot;Scheduled Date&quot; ..  Eye for an Eye .. seems the way folks are heading .. NO I don't like it .. NO I wont do this .. but YES I am ticked. I am following the rules (spirit or not) to a T and have to spend time dealing with BS (my raid being overstepped) and rules interpretation.<br>
<br>
Fourth:<br>
<br>
/cheer Saphdia<br>
/cheer Saphdia<br>
<br>
and hell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ..<br>
<br>
/cheer Saphdia<br>
<br>
Saphdia and her guild gave up FG's two Fridays in a row for Guardian Revelation and then Harpers because of the &quot;Rules&quot; impacting the &quot;Scheduled&quot; date of Naggy (my other peeve).  I just have to say, and am sure from Harpers as well, THANK YOU!<br>
<br>
Fifth:<br>
<br>
I just suggested some rules changes that would help you moderating the boards and give guilds a better shot at getting themselves scheduled.  I am TOTALLY disgusted with what has become another &quot;Camp&quot; (Sorry, I am not really into the random your suggestion .. good suggestion, but can see some nasty ramifications).  <br>
<br>
As long as there is not a viable way suggested to get ALL folks a fair chance (not a select group of &quot;Really good pressing the buttons&quot; Guilds), which to me equates removing the ability or benefit of &quot;Camping&quot; the boards, I will use the rules to my advantage.<br>
<br>
I am beginning to belive there are very few folks looking out for anyones benefit other than their own or own guilds (DO NOT read ALL folks and ALL guilds into this please).  From what I am reading in Saphdia's post, this further shows through.  Until we all respect the &quot;spirit&quot; of the rules, I can't see the point of being impacted by those that don't.....<br>

Please re-read my posts.  I think you might rethink yours, as your totally off base.  I am NOT asking for a change of rules like your interperting.   Actually, quite the contrary and pointing out a hole in the rules.<br>

As far as camping happening on the board, I think you are looking at this the wrong way. If Circuit City opens at 10 am and you get there 5 till are they gonna open the dorrs early just for you? NOPE. <br>
---------<br>
<br>
Lets look at it this way .. do you or I have any more of a right to be in Circuit City because you figured out how to pick the lock better than I?  I don't think so .. so I tossed a stone at the glass (first post .. early) .. and walked through it (second .. valid post) just past 10AM <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

With any system, there will be issues no matter what.  For the most part, these rules and the way things have been run so far, have worked and been the most fair any other system could provide.   <br>
<br>
I am concerned about NOT following the rules and having biases or feelings by the moderator put in.  These questions coming up are posed in general, not to you, Dahli.  <br>
<br>
I'm concerned when the moderator says there is an issue of people posting early, then reposting and finally hitting the mark.  Let's face it, this happens once in a blue moon.  Not like everyone and their dog has been doing this days on end.  <br>
<br>
The other thing I'm concerned with is a comment made on not being able to have 2ppl sign up for a guild.  Big deal.  Pharma and I do whatever..is it now time to keep a list of who can put up the post per guild?  Is this seriously a big deal?<br>
<br>
My final concern is what I posted earlier.  The fact that Pharma was told to work it out in game with FF guild when he clearly had the date and things posted well enough before they even posted JUST because the subject heading was wrong and the body was right..on what date it was for.  Note: there used to be a rule in place where you could not edit the original post to correct any mistakes.<br>
<br>
<br>
I just think it is time we stop trying to change things every time we find issue with it.  And let's try to keep biases out just because we are tired of seeing something.  Is it in the time limit or not?  That is the question.<br>

Me missing the post isn't what this thread was about. I posted early oh well Delete the post like it should be, but, Its about my LEGAL post that came at 12:01 that has been locked and is being &quot;reviewed&quot;. Why? I didn't break any of the CURRENT rules. I'm allowed to post for BOTH PLANES. As I've stated before, if you want to change the rules fine, my post came before the change of the rules, so reguardless of what you do my post will be valid. Please reopen my post so people can sign-up. <br>

Seriously, I don't think we have any problems that can really be fixed. We play a game in a community of mixed personalities. We are scattered all over the world with different scheduels and different ideas of what is important to us in Everquest.  We try to do things in a manner that best suit us all. Not everyone will be happy. Thats impossible. <br>
<br>
Adun and the other moderators are trying their best. This is a voluntary service they provide us on their own free time. I think everything is fine.<br>

Hrm .. the problem I have is I am reading that it is &quot;OK&quot; that ET/Lanos does not accept the rules, thinks it is &quot;OK&quot; to have his own rules, and finds it acceptable to flip a bird at rules you and I have accepted.  Ya know what .. I don't give a fuck he lives in Europe .. and don't give a fuck that he thinks someone else stepped on him. That gives him no right to break the &quot;Brell&quot; rules or stomp on my raid.<br>
<br>
FG Issue:<br>
<br>
FACT:  We posted first - Per the RULES.<br>
FACT:  FG's are 8 hour schedules - Thats the RULE.<br>
FACT:  He posted with as START time that was 6 hours before ours.  That breaks the rules.<br>
FACT:  He refused to stop when told he was breaking the rules.<br>
FACT:  His responses were as mentioned above.<br>
FACT:  There is nothing via the rules I can do about it .. you say accept peoples feelings .. I say accept mine as well.<br>
FACT:  I can do something here on the boards and make an impact in game towards his methods.<br>
<br>
Fear Issue:<br>
<br>
FACT: Tyia post early on PoH<br>
FACT: Tyia post early on PoF<br>
FACT: Those posts will automatically be deleted - Per the RULES<br>
FACT: Tyia re-posted within the permited time .. before others.  Valid to do so by the RULES.<br>
<br>
Re Adun/Adune and other Mods:<br>
<br>
I don't have issues with any of the moderators.  The concern vocalized here toward Adun/Adune is that we know there is a per-se &quot;hole&quot; in the current rules and that would accept a rule change that prohibited this.  But as the rules stand today, the post is valid and am concerned that it was locked.<br>
<br>
Pose this question to you .. if we post this eve for Tuesday two weeks what happens? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If this current post is not permited, we are ok .. if it is that leaves this date open (/ponder) and puts us in violation of the rules .. /shrug.  Facts still remain that we did not break the rules, just utilizing the rules to more efficiently permit GR the best chance to host a PoF/PoH raid.  As such, the date needs to stand.<br>

Their fear post has been validated.<br>
<br>
What I wanted to respond to is the simultaneous posting of Hate &amp; Fear reservations.  While it's currently legal, it's not something I want to see more of.  First off, I see it as breaking the spirit of the rules.  Secondly, it makes a lot of extra post checking &amp; garbage post deletion.  Ditto with multiple guild members trying to sign up for the same date.  Ditto for posting multiple posts for the same day.<br>
<br>
We'll clarify things once all the mods have had a chance to discuss it.  For the time being, I don't like the idea of guilds making multiple posts for the same date, or multiple planes.  To make my job easier, I'd like to ask everyone not to do that. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalerin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talerin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/12/01 11:13:54 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fastlane.net/~kurtis/wow/talerin.jpg width=120 height=180></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Adun</span><hr size=1> Would like to see a seperate thread on the FG thing.  Sadly it seems that Lanos figures that whatever benefits him is all that matters (going by his previous posts) and is gonna do whatever he wants.  Personally I think this is complete unadulterated GREED coupled with a TOTAL DISREGARD for anyone else.  Somehow, I suspect he would be the first one to be here crying if the roles had been reversed.  Of course he wants FFA, with patch times and European time he would be able to run in on a lot of stuff before the majority of the players on the server are able to play.  I imagine we'll see more of this callous disregard for others in the future.  By the standards of what we try to do on this server his action was just plain wrong.  However, I imagine that if he even responds he'll have a bunch of lame-ass excuses to justify his actions.  Not that he cares.  To bad he is out to ruin the rep of a guild that has some good folks in it. <p>Talerin Gwathfea <BR>

The instant you forbid a guild from posting to the schedule is the day you start FFA on the server.<br>
<br>
<br>
And the difference with my posting to Fear and Hate is that I posted to Hate 14 mins AFTER I found out that I was in a 4 way tie for Fear and didn't want to go through the hassles of solving it.  Hate was still open so I took it at about 12:14:00 and deleted my tied post for Fear.  Hardly board camping 14 mins after midnight.  14 seconds usually puts you 10th in line.<br>
<br>
<br>

I can't see Twig's as a bad thing.  Who can blame him for posting, waiting to see if it went through, finding out it didn't, and trying to grab another.  Too bad you can't set your own time limit on posts allowed on a specific forum.  Could just set it to like 30 minutes on the raid forum.<br>

I should dig out the old message board script I wrote a year ago.  Well anyway, I'd back you on some regulations for posting Adun.
