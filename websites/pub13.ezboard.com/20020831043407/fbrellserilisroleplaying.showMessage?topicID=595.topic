The blood and the pain are holy and will only take me further into his graces.  Innoruk has no place in his service for the weak and unworthy.”  People drinking in The Maidens Fancy looked at each other and then one of them spoke. “Looks like Sarilella Sa’Riik is in labor again.  You would think they were humans in the way that couple breeds prolifically.  I can set my 5 year calendar by she labor sounds.”  <br>
<br>
Most of the patrons snickered, but one man stepped forward wearing blood red armor, “You want to change that statement about humans, scum?”  The young Teir’dal drew his blade and stepped forward to the offending parties table.  <br>
<br>
“Treanani, uhm, sorry I didn’t realize you were here.  It was just a joke.  No offense meant to you or your Lady Wife.” the man stammered.  No one ever talked easily with Treanani around, favored chosen of Innoruk.  The last person that offended him was fed piece by piece to the piranha found out in the waters of Nektulos forest.  <br>
<br>
The shadow knight sneered, “You are lucky today is blessed by Innoruk as the coming of our twins has been spoken of by prophets and priests alike.  In 400 years no woman of the Temple of Innoruk has even given birth to twins.”  He moved swiftly to the bar, resheathing his blade.  The bartender handed him a glass of blood wine without being asked and motioned to the Dark Elf Ambassador to let him know that the drink was already paid for.  <br>
<br>
The real reason that Treanani had not struck the man down where he sat was worry.  Emotions always took some of the pleasure out of a kill for Treanani and he tried to never react in anger, unless he was bored.  Death came easy to the shadow knight and few were his peer, nor favored as he was with Innoruk.  He knew that and it did not matter.  He worshipped and killed for Innoruk as only a true devout could.  That is what made the bond between him Sarilella was so strong.  Her worship and service to their Lord was no less compelling.  Even when they coupled she was found more often to scream Innoruk’s name than his own.  <br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in the Temple, the chosen clerics of Innoruk moved around anxiously, awaiting the birth of the fore told twins.  One of their greatest prophets had scryed for this birth and told them of the great power one of the children had and how it would change the devout lives of the Sa’Riik family forever.  <br>
<br>
Both sides of the family worshiped Innoruk with a passion that some found disturbing.  It was said that sacrifice had been a weekly tradition in both families, at one time, or another.  Some whispered that they practiced it still.  But the great power that Treanani and Sarilella shared was not to be trifled with, and many felt that what ever they did was justifiable to put forth the devotion to Innoruk that they had.<br>
<br>
Sarilella struggled and pushed, none of the clerics had ever seen her struggle with a labor like this before. All of her previous births had been so easy that people felt that Innoruk himself had stepped forward to help her and welcome her children into his service.  She pushed and the child came forth, screaming its way into the darkness of the Third Gate.  Many feet shuffled forward to see the child that lay there.  The child wailed her fists in the air and managed to hit the Head Cleric four times before they got her wrapped in a clean blanket and laid next to Sarilella.<br>
<br>
The first child raised such a fuss that all the attention in the room soon focused upon her.  If it had not been for Sarilella groaning suddenly no one would have noticed that the next child arrived.  The child did not cry out, though all could see by her color and movement that she was healthy.  She tossed her head back and forth as if searching for something or someone.  As they wrapped her and laid her with her sister next to their Mother she finally settled down, as did the wails of the first child.  They reached their hands forward and as they touched both of them seemed completely happy.<br>
<br>
The Head Cleric watched the children amazed at their actions towards each other.  They were identical from the color of their hair to their overall size, even born at the same height and weight.  He cleared his throat and spoke, breaking the silence that had fell once the children came together, “Innoruk blesses us this day to be witness to a great birth such as this.  May the blood and pain shared in this room raise all our spirits closer to Him in all His greatness.  Also, may these children share their souls with him as they seem to with each other, if they do His power can only flourish more and help to overcome the heathens that chose to worship the other flawed Gods risen up from the imaginations of the unworthy.”<br>
<br>
Sariella raised her self up on one elbow and looked over her children.  &quot;Welcome and may Innoruk's glory shine on you from this day forth.  Into this world I bring forth Theren and Sheren Sa'Riik.&quot;  With that pronouncement she leaned back onto the bed and began to intone her nightly prayers to her God in the Plane of Hate above.<br>
