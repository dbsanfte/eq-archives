This is coming from the mind of a non &quot;uber&quot;, non-mod, 54 enchanter, so please correct any misconceptions or inaccuracies if present. <br>
<br>
Create a list of &quot;God Killers&quot; that are assigned to go and kill the god the day before patch day.  This list would be comprised strictly of the people that have killed the god.<br>
<br>
The current debate is two sided in terms of killing the gods.  #1  The &quot;ubers&quot; are concerned on missing out on &quot;phat lewt&quot; (god do I hate that term) and having a god &quot;go to waste&quot;.  #2  The &quot;other guilds&quot; are concerned that their raid will be infringed upon or that the god will be killed out of turn thus denying them any chance at even attempting them.  If you create a list of &quot;God Killers&quot; that go in the day before patch day, this negates both arguments.  The &quot;ubers&quot; get their weekly god kill and the &quot;other guilds&quot; don't get their toes stepped on (except for the day before patch day's raid, but that can be worked out between the god killers and the normal raid like we're doing right now).  This system gives everyone a shot at killing the god that wants it, and prevents the cries of &quot;well UberGuild_00 came in and just started killing everything and took all the fun out of raiding&quot;.  If a guild kills a god on their normal raid, they are in turn added to the &quot;god killers&quot; list if they want and put into the rotation.  If they fail at their attempts (notice the plural) to kill the god on patch day minus 1, they are removed from the rotation until they kill the god on their normal turn in fear/hate.<br>
<br>
If there are any flaws in this mindset, I would encourage you to point them out.  From my standpoint this seems fair and reasonable for both sides of the issue.<br>
<br>
Just a suggestion,<br>

I dunno how many people are really in it only for loot.  I personally love the 15 minute amazing fights.  Loot is nice, but I enjoy the accomplishment of winning more.<br>

If a raid which has the god up wants to kill him, they are fully entitled to try it. If they want to delegate that right to someone who asks, they are entitled to do so. Anyone can ask. From SR to the Itty Bitty Brigade, ANYONE can contact a raid leader and get their consent to try the god. How does that favor the uberguilds? Seems like some people are just too lazy to deal with it in game and have to have another silly list system to clog up the works. <br>
<br>
Before you get all hogwild about starting up more lists, if you really wanna kill a god, talk to the leaders of raids where hes up and see if you can work something out for a joint raid or whatever. Its a hell of a lot easier. <br>
<br>
The only counterargument I've seen is the sort of silly one that he belongs to the next day's raid. Guess what, the rule has always been.. if the God isnt up when you walk into the plane you got no right to anything. The only issues came up when people jumped in without the permission of the prior days raid leader. That hasnt been the case, lame rumors to the contrary, since the new CT came up. Each and every time he has been killed it was either a free day, or the raid leader gave permission for the kill. <br>
<br>
How the system you propose would improve anything, other than the amount of time CT is left standing, is unclear to me at best.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicophorus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicophorus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Less Talk, More Fight</span><br>  Posts: 717<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 2:13:44 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Suggestion for gods in Hate/Fear</span><hr size=1> Agreeing with Thoric on this notion.<br>
<br>
Basically the &quot;Uberguild&quot; getting approval to go whack the god is similar to any other one of us signing on for the raid.  Someone has a raid, they post signups, those of us that want in sign up.  We go, raid succeeds/fails.  Day ends, next day comes.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think the &quot;Ubers&quot; (for lack of a better term, no offense intended to any guilds uber or otherwise) asking in on raids shows complete respect for the system and is well within its spirit.<br>
<br>
Moreso, by not reserving the raid dates, they're helping to diffuse backlog on resources that they don't want or need.<br>
<br>
If there's any 'change' in this manner it should be an unofficial one... just an expectation that a raid leader needs to keep in mind all resources he/she is reserving... i.e a higher level raid keeping in mind planar drops and a lower level raid keeping in mind that the tougher MoBs in the zone probably require a bigger gun.<br>

When more and more people are able to take down the gods, the &quot;ubers&quot; will be seen to be cutting in line.  &quot;How so?&quot; you may ask.  Well lets say guild A has been continually going in and killing the god and other sub-bosses the day the patch comes out.  How is this fair to guild B, who is signed up for fear/hate 3 or 4 days after the patch comes out?  Seems to me that guild A is removing everyones chance at even trying the god by stealing him the first day he pops.  And I hate to say this, but as of now on this server, when someone calls a guild to go in and kill a god, who do you think they're gonna call?  It's taking away any shot the other guilds have at killing the mob in question.  <br>
<br>
If you dont want another nasty list or something of that nature all I'd say is this.  Why dont you wait till day before patch day to go in and kill him.  If it's not such a big deal, why don't you give other people throughout the week a shot at them as well? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utwiggietymberwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twiggie Tymberwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 809<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 3:57:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Suggestion for gods in Hate/Fear</span><hr size=1> I think you are jumping way ahead of things.  There are three guilds that have taken down CT and maybe 3 others that could have a decent shot.   CT is not the panzy he used to be.  I'm sorry but when a mob gives SR/Watchers/Enshadowed a good spanking here and there then 95% of the raids going to Fear for armor drops aren't even going to dent him for a long time.  Most raids can't even take down Fright (whichever has the AE) let alone Draco or CT.  Most raids to Hate can't even GET TO Inny in time to try him. <br>
<br>
I don't see how the raid leader allowing them to come into the plane to help with CR and then kick the crap out of CT/Draco is a problem.<br>
<br>
Man, people will complain about anything, on other servers if an uber guild ASKED to come in to the plane like that people would have a heart attack.  On other servers they don't ask, they just take.  Be grateful that Ganon/Rykilth are decent people and actually ask instead of just taking.  And not only do they ask but they follow your response.  If you told them no then they wouldn't come in.   So its not some &quot;I'll ask and you better say yes or we'll do it anyway&quot; type asking.<br>
<br>
 I've been on 20ish Hate raids and have NEVER seen Inny.  Maybe I just don't let that stuff bother me and just enjoy the 8 to 10 hours of hanging out with friends and having a good time.<br>

So there's no way of ever being able to reserve a plane with any certainty that the Gods will be up.<br>
<br>
If a patch day comes, and guildA has fear reservd 3 days later, but they really want to take a crack at a god... then they can wait until the scheduled raid from that evening gets done with their raid, just like I have seen other god capable guilds like SR and CS do.<br>
<br>
So basically...  I guess gods are now FCFS, but rather than having the first person to engage the mob being the determining factor.. you now have the raid leader being the determining factor.  Sounds like a fair and just system to me.  AS LONG AS the god killers continue the current trend of receiving permission to kill the god. (which no reasonable person should deny, but it's a courtesy thing) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1561.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1559.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1568.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1568.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1568.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
