------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
** General **<br>
<br>

** Tales **<br>
<br>
Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights.  The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was.  The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest.  The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br>
<br>
Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck.  He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying.  The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand.  Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently.  There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol.  Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror.  It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire.  Glox looked down at his pupil again.  &quot;Where did you get this?&quot;  The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin.  &quot;sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned...&quot;<br>
