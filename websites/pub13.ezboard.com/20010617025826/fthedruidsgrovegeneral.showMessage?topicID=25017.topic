While it seems confused, it first appears that the GM thought they were exploiting by putting their clerics where they couldn't get summoned (which is impossible), or by using the CH/CoH technique to control aggro.

<br>
 So, the question is: Where's the exploit?<br>
<br>
 Apparently, there are 51+ mobs in the game that _don't_ summon.  A post on the FoH page strongly implies this.  If so, keeping clerics where a mob can't get to them might be considered an exploit.<br>
<br>
 Also, one of the things Conquest was doing was rezzing characters during the fight.  People were being evasive about this, so it seems likely something way over my head is going on here.  One thing someone said was that maybe you could duel and die and have a cleric rez you, but don't click yes.  Then, get the fourth warder low enough that the Sleeper spawns and DTs everybody.  Immediately click Yes (aren't you Loading Please Waiting at this point?  Beats me) and you're there ready to fight the Sleeper who may not have been set up to actually have any significant combat ability since everybody should be dead, right?  This paragraph has confused me greatly.<br>
<br>
 Or maybe rez effects are a protection against the fourth warder's aoe breath attack?  This is called a shot in the dark.<br>
<br>
 Or maybe Verant is going to decide to define Cleric CH/Mage CoH as an exploit?<br>
<br>
 I dunno, but the tone of what I've read is that Conquest _was_ doing something &quot;chimpy&quot;.  But... Verant (well, Abashi, I think) considers kiting &quot;chimpy&quot;. ;)<br>
<br>
 Overall, I think the Sleeper quest/storyline being broken has played a huge roll in Verant's (over)reaction here.<br>
<br>
 Oh, yeah, just to make clear: rezzing during a fight so people can smack away, even at diminished capacity, can't be an exploit, in and of itself.  No way.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I am writing this now to clear up any misconceptions on what happend last night. Here is what happend...<br>
<br>
We were fighting the 4th warder (ventani) and had it down to 60% or so when kerafyrm spawned, and wiped us out. Kerafyrm then killed the 4th warder.<br>
<br>
Roughly 15 minutes laster, GM Valdelmar comes in and has this to say.<br>
<br>
[Tue Jun 05 00:37:10 2001] Valdelmar shouts, 'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone, or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a warning for Exploitation.'<br>
<br>
Now this is where it gets good. When asked what exactly we exploited, here was the answer:<br>
<br>
[Tue Jun 05 00:44:50 2001] Valdelmar tells you, 'We witnessed your clerics below the bridge keeping the warders agro by complete heal so that the tanks could safely kill. That's exploitation'<br>
<br>
Now, anyone who plays the high EQ game or has a reasonable knowledge of EQ game dynamics knows that this completly IMPOSSIBLE to exploit.<br>
<br>
The mobs summon ability negates this exploit 100%. If the clerics are top on aggro list, they get summoned up from below the bridge, and killed nearly instantly. The mob was on ME (the warrior) the entire battle, besides when it decided it was mad at my clerics - which is when it killed them in no time flat. In fact, if you look at the first screenshot in yesterdays update:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/st1.JPG">eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/st1.JPG</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
You can clearly see that I am stating that the REASON WE LOST is because the clerics gained too much aggro and were killed, and that I am saying that in order to win, we have to clerics aggro less than my own (so he stays on the tank).<br>
<br>
We've all been playing this game for years now... To be treated like this was basically a slap in the face. We had a LIGIT tactic to take down the 4th warder, and verant suspends us over some BS exploit that isnt even possible to execute.<br>
<br>
Why? Because we showed the playerbase that the sleepers script was STILL not finished like they said?<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Obviously this GM does not play EQ.  If he did, he would have understood the concept that if you're aggro by a level 51+mob, there's nowhere you can hide because the mob will SUMMON you !<br>

<br>
Uh, who says it's impossible to position yourself where you can't get summoned?  You haven't played this game enough, because even in my dim memory of it I remember examples of how you could do this, by basically fooling the NPC into thinking that you are within the melee range when in fact you are not.<br>
<br>
With extremely few exceptions, tactical advantages like this are considered exploits in Everquest, and everyone knows it.  Also, abusing spell stacking rules in a way that prevents an offensive NPC mechanic from operating is an exploit.  If you exploit, you have to face the consequences if you are caught.  Here, the consequences were not that harsh, as the accounts were only suspended.<br>
<br>
I also find it funny how, on the one hand, the guild leader denies cheating, yet on the other hand the guild admits on their own board that they used gimpy tactics.  Sure, I bet they had group members underneath a bridge just for the, umm, view, not to exploit. ;)<br>
<br>
Obviously they aren't true Sciroccoites, because they are shameful -- not proud -- of being exploiters.  :P<br>

<br>
What do you want, a press release?  :)<br>

They suspended the accounts of exploiters; that happens all the time.<br>

"Cheesy" or "gimpy" tactics are just euphemisms for "exploit" and "cheat".

<br>
Not a lawyer here and don't play one on TV.  Verant has a history of under estimating what players can and will do.  If they put it in the game where players can get to it they should expect players to see what they can do to it.  If it was not ready for players they should not have put it in the game yet.  Now think of all the broken quests and item nerfs.  Thousands of people playing with something will find things that the designers never thought of.  So people find a way to do things that verant does not like and Wham out comes the stick.  Why do you think the Offical message boards got shut down?  Verant could not take the heat.  They almost never admit when they are wrong and have a history of over reacting to things.  The do not have a set of rules in place to deal with players.  They forget players are customers and once others games are released that can compete with EQ I would not be surprised to see many leave EQ and never play a verant game again.  Don't get me wrong EQ is a great game, just verant needs to work on thier customer service big time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uremfin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remfin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/6/01 3:48:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant GMs go overboard again, it seems</span><hr size=1> They were not suspended for &quot;waking the sleeper&quot; as they like to toss around, some idiot GM did that<br>

<br>
Exploits are things generally NOT meant to be done in the game, let's look at this &quot;exploit&quot;.  Cheal generates a lot of aggro as the most efficient heal in the game, CoH removes aggro almost completely.  Now I may not be a smart man, but it makes a hell of a lot of sense to use these two spells together.<br>
<br>
If the breath of the 4th warder has a slow component, then I can see why that would bounce off rez effects, I believe rez effects also have a slow component.  I can see that being considered an exploit because &quot;creative spell stacking&quot; has always been frowned upon, and definitely is caused by a deficiency in the game engine.<br>
<br>
Placing clerics below the bridge to avoid the silence makes SENSE.  If this wasn't meant to happen then VI would have done 2 things: 1) have all breath effects go through walls 2) place Line of Sight limitations on PC-PC healing. <p><IMG SRC="http://lordfate.homestead.com/files/misc/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeoni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peoni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/6/01 4:25:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant GMs go overboard again, it seems</span><hr size=1> Its wrong to ban them for rezing their dead mid fight.<br>
<br>
Everyone here might not be familiar with velious big mob fights, but its quite common to have a set group of ppl designated to rez tanks as they die and get them back up and fighting as quickly as possible. Fights go on for way more that a minute or 2 so getting tanks back into a fight is a good tactic to use...<br>
<br>
If the newly rez'd ppl were immune to the AE you can't really blame the players in this instance - what are they supposed to do ? not rez ppl mid-fight ? yeah right. Yes its a stacking issue that should be solved, but banning them is way out of line.<br>
<br>
I think Verant are over-reacting because yet again they have decieved all the playerbase and they were found out once again.... Their product testing is poor, boarding on non-existant and their customer server fairs no better.<br>
<br>
I'm personally disgusted that Verant sell a half finished expansion (which we've nearly all paid for (velious)) and ship it out. They're currently working on a new project (luclin) and Velious is still NOT finished.... (sleeper had the naked human model and this is months after ppl encountered the unfinished velious zones).<br>

You want to know the most gimpy tactic in the game?  Mob summoning.  <br>
<br>
In order to play the game the way Verant wants you play it, you must lower your intelligence to match the AI and DI.  The easiest way to do this is to consume a fifth of scotch before playing.  Or if you want a permanent fix, consider a frontal lobotomy.<br>
<br>
Sorry, rezzing in the middle of a battle isn't an exploit.  If Verant has any stacking issues with regard to the res effects that IT IMPOSED ON US, then Verant needs to fix them.  It's ridiculous to not expect players to be ressed in the middle of a battle, given the fact that Verant has designed these battles to last several minutes (as you yourself admit in the other thread here on melee).<br>
<br>
And hiding under a bridge to shield yourself from the harmful effects of an AoE attack just strikes me as common sense.  <br>
<br>
Of course, in VerantSpeak, Common Sense = Exploit.<br>

<br>
If there is a problem with spell stacking from two detrimental spell all they had to do is allow the worse of the two to overwrite the other..  would take a programer 15 mins if he knew what he was doing. <br>
<br>
As for clerics under the bridge, that is the same as them standing just outside of the AoE range.. Makes good sence so must be an exploit.  <br>
<br>
I expect to be banned any day now for root/doting mobs since I can do it and it must be an exploit.  Any sound tactic that works is an exploit to Verant.  <p><a href=mailto:karl_saffell@hotmail.com>Kulothar</a></br>

<br>
I have to say that I agree that it's a knee-jerk reaction.  I'll grant that I've never been in a high end fight/raid, so I don't know too much about rezzing mid-fight or the other tactics involved, but as of right now, not even the members of Conquest who were suspended seem to know exactly what their exploit WAS.  It seems to me that if VI was in the right, they'd back it up with some reason.<br>
<br>
But as for whether or not their tactics were cheezy, reports indicate that the mob flurried for something like 2200 a hit.  THAT sounds a bit cheezy to me.<br>
