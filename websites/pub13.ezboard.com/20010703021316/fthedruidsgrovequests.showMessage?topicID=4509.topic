<br>
I didn't believe it myself until I tried it. And yes, this IS info post-patch.<br>
<br>
What really gets my goat is that there are 23,834 cool items for melee classes, about 17,324 for int casters and clerics/shamans, and about 23 items for druids (who happend to make up the largest population).<br>
<br>
You know, I never bash Verant. I'm prety laid back. But this was @#%$ BULLSHIT. Give us a bone from your Ivory Tower guys.<br>

It even extends to the planes.<br>
<br>
At least on the tribunal server verm pretty much does not exist even if you raid fear a whole lot. <br>
<br>
If you do get some its almost always verm arms, gloves,  boots or cap.. yay... oohh. The arms are basically hollowed bone bracers you easily get off rathyl in najena in a few minutes. The gloves are pretty much totally worthless as far as stats and you more or less wear them just to be wearing some verm. The cap has good charisma and might be okay for a charming kit (if you even bother with that) but is pretty much junk.<br>
<br>
When the BP or legs do drop.. and i mean RARELY, of course with 30 plus druids in your &quot;uber&quot; guild and most of them being so loot hungry and tenacious that they show up for every raid, you will never get these unless you are on the top of the tiers for loot in your guild. One guy in my guild has the bp and legs, the rest of us run around in shrouds of nature, ulthork tunics and even bcps (AHAHAH those people crack me up.. but really there is not stuff a whole lot better) and are levels 54 - 60. <br>
<br>
Another bad thing is eventual turnover. It takes SO LONG even raiding fear a lot that even when you do get the bp or verm legs eventually that person that high in the tier gets bored and quits their char/sells it/moves on to another guild so these SUPER rare items are not even in your guild. Another guy in my guild had both then saw that in the 50 - 60 game, especially in velious, druids pretty much get JACK. So now he has a druid with a verm bp and legs WHO IS NOT EVEN PLAYED and I was there on the raids where HE GOT THEM. HOW DO I FEEL? HOW DO YOU THIKN THAT MAKES ME FEEL? Meanwhile the rogue he started easily got up to like 54 or so being in demand for grouping and guess what? ITS ALREADY TOTALLY COVERED IN ASSASINS FROM POG!!!!<br>
<br>
Thats right,as if the previous ways of druids getting planear good armor were not bad enough while meanwhile sk and cleric stuff dropped like candy, now they put in the Plane of Gear for those classes WHO WERE ALREADY ON THE HEAVY DROP SIDE IN THE OLD PLANES. WHAT THE SAM HECK WERE THEY THINKING????? <br>
<br>
So now my guild is stuck on doing POG, which leaves me going on kael raids with shoestring groups of desperate people. Even after the supposed &quot;nerf&quot; Pog still drops armor pretty much like candy compared to the other planes or kael materials dropping for thurg quests. This makes it so they keep wanting to do it even though they are covered in it for the most part.<br>
<br>
The worst examples of this are pretty much the sk and cleric. Their armor drops like candy in the old planes. Their armor drops like candy in POG. They all had the old plane set raiding no where NEAR as many times as I have. They all have the pog set nearly just raiding pog since velious has been out.. again no where NEAR how many times I've been in fear. <br>
<br>
So I don't get what the heck verant is thinking, but even if you JUST take the planear drops druids are pretty screwed. Oh, then they &quot;fix&quot; it by giving druids ranger and pallys velious type drops(same as the thurg quest stuff anyway) on the 2nd floor of hate which HARDLY EVER DROPS STUFF AND IS HARD AS HECK TO DO. So of course a guild used to the high drop rate of pog and spoiled by it does not really want to &quot;waste&quot; the time and effort on 2nd floor of hate for 2 drops. <br>
<br>
This HORRIBLE design leaves the classes left out of the velious drop like candy loop, especially druids, in DIRECT competition with the rest of their guild to try to get the guild doing things where they actually get loot. It gets very, very old. <br>
<br>
That is the biggest problem I see with loot for us. The quest items I see as number 2 since we are only really looking at how rare it is for us to have good accessory items because WE DON'T GET THE MAIN ITEMS EVERYONE ELSE DOES EITHER. <br>
<br>
This apparent judgement by verant that we don't require equipment has deluded players of other classes into thinking the same thing. We complain of running around at level 54 in level 30 -35 gear basically and the other people in our guild say &quot;oh but you are a druid you don't really need equip..&quot;  oh yeah, sure shut the heck up ok? I do too. <br>
<br>
You just don't get the resistences, plus mana, ac or the wisdom you need to make up for having big plus resistence or mana items on accessory parts unless you have the equiv of planear armor. The skyshrine stuff is really the best of all but that requires a pretty darn uber guild which must compete with other more uber guilds already there. Once again, this is very likely to make your guild see that as something to do &quot;in the far off future&quot; and continue raiding POG and the occasional outdoor dragon now. Both of which of course net you ZERO reward except loss of time.<br>
<br>
Its funny, last time my guild was in POG and such i concentrated killing the swarm queen thing in nk and west k getting a blue diamond and diamond in one of the best and cheapest ways I can and had them made into res gear. At least now since I get crud for equipment there are ways I can get one heck of a res kit made to wear while I run around in my shroud of nature and kromriff military quest legs. <br>
