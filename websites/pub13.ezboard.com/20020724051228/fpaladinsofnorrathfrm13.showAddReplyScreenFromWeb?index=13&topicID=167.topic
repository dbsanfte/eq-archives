And, to be honest, this is the case. If you arent at the stage of the game where you are gunning for the emporer, you will see this as a great item.<br>
<br>
The problem is, for a great while, the only people who will see emporer loots are people who have been doing the EQ thing for a few years. If you dont have a comparable cloak by now Im fairly comfortable saying that you will not see Emporer loot for a long while.<br>
<br>
After what is required to kill the emporer (bane camp for every melee, key camp for ever player, door keys for guild) the loot should outclass every other loot in the game. Right now its a disappointing upgrade. My guess is that they will upgrade a lot of Luclin loot. Remember when you first saw Vulak loot? ToV hosted the most difficult encounters for a long time. There were lots of wipes and lots of strats to learn. The payoff was a huge increase in guild power coming from quality loots. There is no Vulak/HoT quest item that isnt the best for its slot. The emporer encounter is MUCH more difficult than ToV ever was and requires MUCH, MUCH more time. The payoff should be shockingly nice loot. Huge focus bonuses, 125 hp/mana items, clickables with insane effects.<br>
<br>
What has happened is VI backed themselves into a corner lootwise. They dont know how to make things more uber without overpowering people. They learned their lesson with Trak CH bps. They dont want to make that same mistake again. Their first response to this was skill mod items. Their 2nd was focus items. The skill mod thing has yet to be tapped. There are no items out there with signifigant skill mod bumps except rogue backstab things. (And the Mrylo dagger/Ssra dagger skill mods already put them at 252 skill). They botched the focus thing by giving amazing power to mages the first day. Unfortunately, they have yet to implement the focus thing onto any droppable items. This will happen soon, as they are running out of things to put 100hp/mana on.<br>
<br>
They have the tools to make uber loot within their system now, they just have yet to implement it. This is why Im expecting a grand scale Luclin loot upgrade very soon. The items that are out there right now basically dont stand up to vulak loots. They know its bad, we know its bad.<br>
<br>
Sorry to rant way off topic, its just something thats been bothering me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  My point is that if this item is uber to you, you need to spend more time in EQ. EQ follows a linear progression when it comes to power increases. Once luclin landed it flatlined. They need to use the tools they created to make luclin items 'uber.' When you kill the emporer of ssra after all the horrible camps involved your first reaction to the loot should be &quot;WOW&quot; no matter where you are in Everquest.<br>

<br>
Its a 'nice' cloak.  It isnt what it should be for the effort expended by any stretch.  No way should you look at something like an emporer drop and wonder if its worth getting, if you see what I mean.<br>
<br>
Xarn is right, Im right, Anyone thats camping Keys and weapons for this guy knows we're right.  Even Triton knows we're right.<br>

That is uber loot, because it give you access to a zone that no one else can yet go to. In this &quot;new NToV&quot; you should find the stuff that your looking for. So in effect I see this mobs drops as Very good.<br>
<br>
Think about Velious when everyone was trying to get into Sleepers Tomb. Many of the dragons you had to kill to get your ST key dropped nothing but the key component. Sure it had haste and nice stats but you knew you were going to turn it in for Sleepers keys. <br>
<br>
The robes, spells and back slot items are bonus. Plus he has been killed exactly once now so who knows what other items are on his loot list.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the looks of this item, but as has been stated if I were close to attempting the Emporer myself I might think otherwise. Still, I think it important to remember that apparently the key peice was on him. This bodes well. They could have made the key peice a rare drop as well. <p><bold><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101014">Baron Varner Rapscallion</a>

<br>
But just as Xarn said, they are in a corner.  They can give the uber mobs uber loot, but they have a phobia of breaking the game, as they have done before.<br>
<br>
I think most are going to be pretty unhappy with Vex Thal loot drops as well.  Its like sports cars.  You can get a nice one that will do 160 for 30 or 40k, but you want one that does 180 and your looking at 200k+,  EQ's getting long in the tooth, and with the design problems I don't think its going to get any better.   Major cost upgrade (in eq = time) for very little return looking at the overall picture, other than being able to say you have the best.<br>
<br>
You notice they effectively took Vulak out of the game, and those drops he has aren't entering the game anymore.  Hmm.<br>

With raid buffs, by the time you can kill this mob, everybody already has max ac, max str, max dex, max sta, and damn near max wis... all your resists are already over 200 more than likely... definately if you have a bard.<br>
<br>
The only stats and effects out there at this time that we need are:<br>
<br>
Hitpoints<br>
MAna regen<br>
health regen<br>
+ATK buffs<br>
Damage shields<br>
And insane ratio weapons.<br>
<br>
So if you wanted a back peice off emperor what should it have?<br>
<br>
Note: Im not disagreeing Im just trying to see how they could make better loot. I read FoH, LoS and other guild's board all the time saying the loot sucks. Well what should the loot be. Remember not to give yourself loot so good that your not destroying the high end content of the game so easily you get bored. <p><bold><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101014">Baron Varner Rapscallion</a>

100hps/100mana (these are always nice and with 100 mana would make a good upgrade to CT cloak)<br>

25wis/int, as said, cant argue there<br>

10 to all resists would be an addition that I think needs to be on this cloak<br>

Shield by now...No matter how long it takes to get to a mob,  and what look comes off it,  people will complain its not good enough for them.<br>
<br>
I'll say if its not the clarity type spell and its only a 250 mana buff,  then its value drops down a ton. <br>
<br>
People are just never happy ,  They want the best gear on every mob,  Well its just not going to happen. Verant makes sure to keep you playing the game by upgrading you slowly and keeping you coming back for more....Every expansion is always the same...People kill all the mobs, complain about the gear...Next expansion comes out and they have better gear.<br>
<br>
People kill all the mobs and complain about the gear,  Verant continues on making more expansions...<br>
<br>
Sure some items can really use a few extra stats to make em better and some uber mobs drop joke items...But thats the way verant wants it....If a mob dropped 10 uber items,  instead of 2 uber ones   4 good ones,  2 ok and 2 sucky ones....People wouldn't be playing the game no more. Cause they would all have uber items.<br>
<br>
Like it has been said before,  this game and especially this Expansion is a huge time sink , Welcome too it. Like the loot or not...Your never gonna get everything you want.<br>

The effect on the shield simply increases max mana by 250. It won't stack with mystical infusion or greater mystical infusion, which I believe are both potion effects. As shown <A href=http://lucy.fnord.net/stacking.html?id=2970&source=Live>here</A>.<br>
