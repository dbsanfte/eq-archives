Because the less popular Everquest is, the less 1337 you are for your accomplishments there. I think the EQ-heads subconsciously want DAOC and other rivals to fail so they can feel justified in having wasted days of time sitting and doing tedious activities just to achieve 1337 status in Everquest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;<br>
<br>
Not really, Tudamorf!  Not everyone has a need to reach leet status in the game.  I never considered the game to a PVP race towards the best gear and status.  I still consider it a PVE game. You may be right regarding the fact that EQ makes great demands for time and dedication and that there are lots of tedious activities.  But there is no denying that EQ has had great success in developing a game that quickly becomes addictive.  There are probably few things as repetitive and tedious as building up tradeskills in EQ, yet most people who start cannot force themselves to stop.  How many of us have been dead tired at 249 in a skill and not willing/able to turn the damn machine off?   <br>
<br>
Oh well, I digressed-as usual-!  Anyway, the success or lack thereof of DAOC will not impact my EQ experience at all.  I could have easily been playing 10 hours a day of Camelot since Beta and not change my opinion about EQ.  <br>
<br>
Now since you opened that can of worm... One could also say that the major attraction of playing DAOC &lt;b&gt;NOW&lt;/b&gt; is the distinct possibility to achieve things that are no longer attainable in Everquest.  Have you seen the great number of signature saying: First level 20, first this, first that?    Hence people could be playing DAOC to again be considered l33t!<br>
<br>
Anyway, I will play EQ as long as it will remain enjoyable or the game remains available.  If Camelot becomes another option, that is great but it really wont impact my decision.  <br>

<br>
In DAoC, we see this in the rush to get to high levels, to get a L33t guild insignia, to get RP (realm points), to take over opposing castles.  It is there just like it was there in EQ.  It is there because it is part of human nature.  (Assuming you want to call players of MMORPGs human...:)<br>
<br>
In EQ, a lot of this feeling makes the L33t hostile to competitor games because it lessens their L33tness, which is derived in large part from the number of players playing the game.  It also underscores the hollowness of this particular goal in these games.  <br>
<br>
DAoC has made an excellent start in the face of tough competition (and EQ is tough competition).  It is still too early to start counting chickens, though.<br>

That's 200 days I didn't bow watching TV, or spend money going to over-priced and over-acted movies, or spent on other PC games. <br>
<br>
I guess the real question is: did you have fun? When you look back on it and consider, do you consider the time spent in EQ to have been used in a way that enteratined you? For me, the answer is a resounding YES! Now, I imagine that some people played and kept playing for some obscure reason, but I did it for fun, and if it had ever at any point become not fun, I would have quit, plain ans simple. <br>
<br>
Now, I'm just now starting into DAoC (only one evening in game so far), and it certainly looks promising. Will it eventually replace EQ for me? Possibly, that remains to be seen, and I think it's WAY to early to tell at this point. However, if it does, I doubt I will look back on my time in EQ as &quot;wasted&quot;. I played it to have fun, and I most certainly did.<br>

I dont know why some of you are acting as though thats some sin.  I dont even think many of you realize that you play for 'leetness' as well, just like many of you dont realize you have some powergamer in you.  I'll go a step further and say the majority of gamers play for 'leetness' or building their character in a direction to be as powerful and unique as possible.  Nobody wants to be average or weak.  Nobody wants to look the same as everybody else.  Most want to be as effective as possible, and that means your goal is 'leetness'.  In fact, 'leetness' is the drive to get you through all that time you waste getting your epic or whatever else thats a pain in the ass to get.  <br>
<br>
In regards to what DAoC players think of EQ players and vice versa, i think the EQ players are sick of hearing all the praise DAoC is getting.  Mostly because they cant escape it and they have already made a decision to stick with EQ for whatever reason.  That leads to animosity towards DAoC.  I think the DAoC players really believe in the game and want others to realize just how much better than EQ it is.  Also, many of the current DAoC players seem to be jaded EQ players.  I'm not playing DAoC or EQ currently, its just an observation from reading the boards.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, i cant really comment on DAoC yet, so i cant really tell if all the praise is over-exxagerated or not.  I cant go back to EQ because i've been there, done that.  Not to knock EQ, since i had fun until i reached the end-game and realized how overrated it was.  And replayability in games means nothing to me since your usually doing the same exact things but with a different type of character.  From what i've read DAoC sounds so much like EQ, it makes sense that they would be compared so often like they are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvinea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vinea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/1/01 2:02:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=46>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mythic has a hit on their hands</span><hr size=1> &lt;i&gt;Why does time spent in EQ have to be wasted?

<br>
I think the problem is that while parts of the game is fun, there is a lot of tedium involved with other parts of the game.  So while the overall experience may be &quot;fun&quot; there were many annoyances for some people.<br>
<br>
Hence, I can state that EQ wasted a lot of my time.  Frankly, any game that has me reading a book while playing has some serious gameplay problems.  Any game that has me looking at a static screen (the spell book) for a large percentage of my play time is pretty f-ing stupid.<br>
<br>
At the time, there were no alternatives.  Now there is...and EQ is history for me.<br>

<br>
That is what kept me playing from May, 2000 through August, 2001 - my friends and guildmates.  If not for them, I would have quit the game way back when, just out of sheer frustration.  The clincher that almost made me quit in May of 2000 was when some dewdz thought it would be cool to trick me into taking treant faction hits by sowing them while they were on the hate list of the treants.  Luckily I didn't get KOS to the treants, but it was a bad hit nonetheless. (I know they were dewdz due to the messages I got "UR fuked now dr00d!" and so on - real intelligent stuff)<br>
<br>
I logged off after seeing those faction messages and seeing the gloating /tells I got from the dewdz (whom I had never even met before ingame) and clicked "Delete" on my main character Khieran, mid 40s at the time.  Then I sat there for several minutes with my mouse cursor poised over the "Yes" button in the confirmation box, just thinking about it.  I eventually clicked "no" but the game was never the same for me after that.  I took a couple weeks off, thought about quitting, then eventually realized that I missed my friends too much and came back.<br>
<br>
Then this past summer, my guild broke up, most of my friends moved on to other games or just quit playing, so in August I was left with just EQ and none of my long-time gaming friends.  No reason to keep playing any more, so I canceled.<br>
<br>
Now several of my EQ friends are showing up in Camelot :)<br>

<br>
Alright, then.  Log in to Everquest, delete all of your characters (with their items), and create new ones with the same name but at level 1.  Have your friends do the same so you can play together.<br>
<br>
If you hesitate to do that, you have to admit you developed some sort of pride over your virtual levels and equipment.  That pride is a result of you achieving something that requires a great deal of tedious activity -- a goal that some other people want but don't have.  Those "other players" (whether real or part of your imagination) foster your pride.  Without them, you don't have much to be proud of.  Just imagine a game where every new player was handed a Xiggin copy when they signed on.<br>
<br>
One MMRPG theorist (whose name I forget) talked about this in terms of glory and shame, and postulated that a MMRPG must have these concepts to be successful.  I think of it more a distribution of 1337ness, but the concepts are similar -- to feel good about yourself in the game, you must achieve something that others haven't.<br>
<br>
Cuchulaine says:  <b><i>Why does time spent in EQ have to be wasted? </b></i><br>
<br>
Because unless you want to stay at level 1 with no equipment, you MUST commit yourself to large amounts of downtime.  If you want to advance in the so-called "end game", you have to endure HUGE amounts of downtime -- in fact, downtime is just about the whole game.<br>
<br>
Downtime = wasted time, unless you are an EQ-head. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/1/01 6:38:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.truepath.com/jadae/Blue.JPG width=102 height=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'll tell ya what</span><hr size=1> I played EQ for over 2 years.

-What guilds with 20 ppl in them are gonna be gone and how many of those are gonna be strong?<br>
-How will EQ/ShadowBane/Starwars gonna play in this?<br>

True I made a lot of good friends, and made many new ones who I previously would not have had any reason to get to know [/waves @ Khieran]. It was friendship that drove Everquest.<br>
<br>
It will be friendship that drive DAOC unless the end game is great. In my opinion that'll be what defines DAOC - the end game. Realm v Realm will either suck or it'll be a massive sucess, I think sucess because once everyone's level 50 - what is there else to do? They'll be some MMORPG virgins, but the rest of us know that once you are level 50, you may asthetically like a better sword and so on, but we know the price you have to pay to get that item - which will decay in DAOC - isn't worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umurkral.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Murkral</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/3/01 12:49:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'll tell ya what</span><hr size=1> <I>Please read the board posting rules located <a href=http://www.goatse.cx>here</a>.
