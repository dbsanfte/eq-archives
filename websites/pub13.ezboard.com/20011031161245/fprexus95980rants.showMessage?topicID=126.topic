Usually I never go /rol and am happy to rez anyone anytime I can.  But when I am in a group and occupied I will only do so if my group is not compromized.<br>
<br>
Today PERSON A requested a res.  I was in the middle of assisting a guildmate on a quest in EK.  I told PERSON A that i would be glad to do it when I was finished but he would have to wait as I was camping some DE.  At that moment the DE popped and we were off and running.  He sent me a tell saying someone else got the DE would I come and rez now.  I told him that was MY group on the DE and I couldnt do so now.  He sent me 3 tells saying he would bring the bod to me and its only a rez and he is so close to his lvl that he needs this rez.  On the last tell he finally started swearing.  I told him that there is no way i would rez him now and why.  Needless tosay.. he wasnt happy.<br>
<br>
PERSON B recieved a rez from me outside Karnor.  I ressed him and zoned into Karnor with my group.  Apparantly, when he popped in he died from someone training the zone.  He requested a second rez.  I told him no since I was occupied now and my group needed me.  He decided that he should take precidence over what i was doing.  By the time I would have been able to get out to him his bod would have popped anyway.  But now, it is MY fault he is having problems.  He said something about Quitting EQ but not till after he kills a few people.  I explained that wasnt very nice and he basically said I am on that list.  He sent me a couple innocous tells ''I see you&quot;  and shouted about some God Awful train that never materialized.  Then later at the zone he hit me with a couple spells.  Not that it hurt, since we were not dueling.<br>
<br>
I dont know what got into PERSON A or PERSON B that they felt they should take precidence to what I was doing.  But it rather upset me.  If anyof you have asked me for resses lately you know I always will help you  if I can and that if I cant its because I am in a group and can not leave.  Why would someone chose to be a complete moron and start to yell at me or threaten me when I would not do what they wanted, when they wanted.  <br>
<br>
This has just been a rant to blow off steam.  And for anyone who wonders why names are not posted.  It is because I chose not to take it to that lvl and sling mud.  These people were an annoyance at the most, nothing else.  So why bring in their names.. maybe they were having a bad day.<br>
<br>
Thanx for your time.<br>

I would have supplied the names if they had actually done something hurtful to myself or my friends.  But, since I merely found them infantile, I chose to leave the names out.  <br>

I will never, ever mind if someone requests a res from me.  I only ever ask that they be patient or have a bit of understanding when I am unable to do as they request.  <br>

<br>
As for people asking politely for a rez. I can't see what is wrong with that. Every class, to one extent or another, can do something special that another person may want. <br>
<br>
Even me, as a bard, gets requsts. Sitting alone, casters come up and ask if they can get manna song, or warriors for healing. Not really a big deal if I am not in a rush, but regenning a warrior may take a while. Not to mention corpse recoveries for people new to a zone.<br>
<br>
The cleric's ability in the game is as unique and powerful as a porter's- if not more. I don't think restricting service to friends and groupmates is really fair. A lot of clerics have done rezzes for me and people in my groups. The exchanges have always been good ones. If they didn't want to do it, they say no, and that's that.<br>
<br>
I never understood why everybody couldn't just be polite. Guess it goes back to your moron statement. <p><IMG ALIGN=center BORDER=0 SRC="http://www.prexus.com/harmonyofsouls/screenshots/sig.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unomiconnekro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nomicon Nekro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/8/00 3:24:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Resurrections... </span><hr size=1> Damn, What a prick..please list &quot;person b's&quot; name, i may know who it is....(he is always threating to quit eq) heh<br>

<br>
There you have it.  You gave your answer, clear, concise, and if they can't understand it, it's no longer your problem.  This is exactly the kind of thing /ignore was made for.  <br>
<br>
Now let me just say this so i'm absolutely clear on my stance.  I'm not saying it's the message recievers responsibility to filter people out accordingly.  I'm not saying that at all.  I think that people should take absolute responsibility for what they say.  If they blow up at someone and act extremely rude then by all means they shouldn't get their res, nor should they themselves be politely treated and should be corrected on their actions.<br>
<br>
But what I am saying though is that just because something is wrong, it won't prevent people from doing it.  For example, most groups now prefer an unusual method of randoming for items such as /random 1 101 or /random 101 200 because of rumors of hack programs.  Does this mean everyone out there is using hack programs to cheat the random system?  Absolutely not.  I feel that the majority of people are quite honest.  However it's a preventative measure to those who abuse the system.  Same principle here.  There's no reason why anyone should have to put up with this kind of abuse in a game, so I would personally just use the tools we have readily available to end it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/00 3:18:37 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/craig234/eq/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Resurrections... </span><hr size=1> Hopefully, they learned a lesson by your appropriate response onhow to behave.<br>

<br>
maybe thats wrong.. but he demanded a rez right?? didnt say what level he wanted did he?<br>
<br>
I throw out Clarity like candy.. but those who demand clarity in a rude way usually get the breeze spell..<br>

Btw, wtg on the rez's.  I die a lot (bard here) and have been fortunate enough to find rez's on every death since about level 46 (when I started plane raids).  I never demand or expect clerics to rez me and I am so happy when they do it.  So big thanks out to the cleric community.<br>

<br>
When we first started our Clerics over a year ago, we didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into.  Yes we knew that Clerics heal, cure, rezz etc etc; but we didn't know how much work it would become in later lvls.  People ask us for rezzes all the time, it's our job, and yes people can get rude about it if we don't rezz them right away.  The best thing to do is ignore these people.  If people ask me nicely for a rezz and I have time; I am more than happy to rezz them.  But some people have no respect for anyone else but themselves.<br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
<br>
A couple weeks ago I was grouped in Lower Guk.  My group got trained after we just got finished fighting off some tough mobs.  We were all medding up and then this guy trains us.  We were all low on mana and the one tank we had was at half life.  Needless to say we all died, and when I zoned back into LGuk, this guy asks me if I can rezz his 2 friends.  I tell him yes I will but it will take me a while because I have to rezz my group 1st.  He continued to say &quot;come on man please it will only take a second.&quot;  I told him yes AFTER I rezz my group.  The guy continued to /tell me to death so I put him on ignore.  I mean come on people us Clerics are people too, and if our group dies, or our friends die; you better know I'm going to rezz them before you.  This may sound a little harsh, but that's the way it is.  Ask us nicely and be patient, and we will get to you.  Sometimes I feel like a doctor with a waiting room full of patients.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
