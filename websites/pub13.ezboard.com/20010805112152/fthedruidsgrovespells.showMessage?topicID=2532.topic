<br>
What are peoples opinions on the going rate/worth of the various mob dropped spells? I know this varies hugely from server to server but at this point there are more 'old' servers than 'new' servers so I'm assuming an old server perspective.<br>
<br>
Velious:<br>
<br>
Ro's Fiery Sundering<br>
Fixation of Ro<br>
Improved Superiour Camouflage<br>
&lt;my opinion: 300-500pp but maybe a lot cheaper.  they are somewhat rare and quite useful&gt;<br>
<br>
Nature Walkers Behest<br>
&lt;my opinion: Everyone agrees that this bear is pretty feeble but he is sooo cute everyone wants him anyway.  3k+, desperate (or rich) people will pay 15k+&gt;<br>
<br>
Protection of the Glades<br>
&lt;my opinion: Great spell, no idea what it's worth...&gt;<br>
<br>
Kunark:<br>
Circle of Winter<br>
Upheaval<br>
Call of Karana<br>
Egress<br>
Circle of Summer<br>
Glamour of Tunare<br>
Spirit of Scale<br>
Blizzard<br>
Form of the Howler<br>
&lt;my opinion: all these 51-54 spells are common as dirt really, you can never buy the one you actually want of course.  If someone has it you should never have to pay more than 250pp.  100pp is possible I am sure&gt;<br>
<br>
Girdle of Karana<br>
&lt;my opinion: rare but sucky.  I wouldn't pay more than 1k for this (I'd prefer 500pp or so) but I'd like to know the 'going rate' anyway&gt;<br>
<br>
Tunares Request<br>
&lt;my opinion: useful but not great.  I reckon 2kpp is a fair price&gt;<br>
<br>
Breath of Karana<br>
&lt;my opinion: handy in pvp but otherwise not great, handy to have a magic based DD and the stun is great but outdoors only limits its usefullness severely. worth about 1500-2000pp imo, going rate? no idea&gt;<br>
<br>
Wake of Karana<br>
&lt;my opinion: cool factor is all it has going for it and it is nowhere as cool as the bear, plus it eats opals and doesn't stop snow (pesky velious).  Worth 1500pp max IMO&gt;<br>
<br>
Bonds of Tunare<br>
&lt;my opinion:  very useful in the right circumstances.  I'd pay 2500pp for it but what's the going rate?&gt;<br>
<br>
Frost<br>
&lt;my opinion:  essential weapon in our arsenal when going up against fire immune mobs, or course we can just sit back and let the tanks deal damage in that case (just fyi I _do_ believe we have a role against big mobs, just not a very glamorous one and one that rarely requires us to do damage).  Another one I would pay 2500pp for.  Sellers going to laugh in my face or think me a sucker?&gt;<br>
<br>
Succor<br>
&lt;my opinion:  so useful for getting to WW, people should be forcing this spell on us as soon as we hit 57.  =)  Back in the real (virtual) world though, I slap my default price tag of 2500pp on it. Opinions?&gt;<br>
<br>
Fist of Karana<br>
&lt;my opinion:  great quad kiting spell (duh, mr. obvious) and handy for ae groups too.  A huge improvement over Lightning Blast (which does have a cooler name imho though :)).  I reckon is it probably only worth 2500pp since you can farm it in Skyfire but if I _had_ to I would pay 5k for this once I hit 58th&gt;<br>
<br>
Regrowth of the Grove<br>
&lt;my opinion:  very convenient, but convenience has a price tag.  How much am I willing to pay for the convenience of the one shot deal?  2500pp or so.  Any conflicting opinions?&gt;<br>
<br>
Legacy of Thorn<br>
&lt;my opinion:  recently been fixed apparently.  I don't like group damage shields though. A lot of casters get panicky when they see this pop up and it sort of encourages tanks other than the designated main tank to get hit.  Worth 2500pp max to me&gt;<br>
<br>
Spirit of Oak<br>
Banishment<br>
Entrapping Roots<br>
Form of the Hunter<br>
Mask of the Hunter<br>
&lt;my opinion: no idea on any of these, but really interested to hear opinions&gt;<br>

<br>
Bonds of Tunare<br>
~~~ this spell is absolutely awesome in the right environments, I would pay 5k for it now having mastered some nice uses, but see it for 2k<br>
<br>
Frost<br>
~~~ still missing it, dont much care about it... probably pay 2-3k<br>
<br>
Succor<br>
~~~ worth as much as you can afford, seen it for 3k and almost bought it as an extra for guild but didnt have the time<br>
<br>
Fist of Karana<br>
~~~ offered 5k for it for a week and couldnt get, a retired druid guildmate had it :)<br>
<br>
Regrowth of the Grove<br>
~~~ You seem to max at 2500 :) another one worth more imo, I would have gone 3-5k easy, but looted it in OS<br>
<br>
Legacy of Thorn<br>
~~~ I use the last one so rarely that I dont even care about this one, probably 4-6k just due to level and rarity though <br>
<br>

The kunark spells are a bit more difficult to get.  So here we go.<br>
<br>
Velious:<br>
<br>
Ro's Fiery Sundering -&gt; uncommon drop, come off random mobs all over.<br>
Fixation of Ro -&gt; same as Sundering<br>
Improved Superiour Camouflage -&gt; unber common drop<br>
<br>
Nature Walkers Behest<br>
Not worth paying a plat for IMO.<br>
<br>
Protection of the Glades<br>
One of the few spells id pay for, Unsure what a druid woud be willing to pay but NO less than 1kp.<br>
<br>
Kunark:<br>
Circle of Winter<br>
Upheaval<br>
Call of Karana<br>
Egress<br>
Circle of Summer<br>
Glamour of Tunare<br>
Spirit of Scale<br>
Blizzard<br>
Form of the Howler<br>
I agree with the prices posted previously.<br>
<br>
Girdle of Karana- I dont have this one - <br>
-&gt; he, i still need this BUT str on items is uber common now and many classes can self buff anyway.  The spell is UNcommon and off higher level mobs.  prolly 500 to 1kp is about right.<br>
<br>
Tunares Request<br>
I would not pay for this BUT it is a VERY nice animal charm spell.<br>
<br>
Breath of Karana<br>
an ok spell with stun and a bit of throw back.  It has its uses for casting mobs outside.<br>
<br>
Wake of Karana<br>
IMO, useless for most situations.  For guild raids, kinda useful but track negates its usefulness.<br>
<br>
Bonds of Tunare<br>
Heh, ill have to pratice using this spell.<br>
<br>
Frost<br>
An excellent spell for fire resistant mobs.  Good in TOV and other dragon slaying events.  Atleast 1kp.<br>
<br>
Succor<br>
Very important spell.  Being able to gate the group to zone instead of hoofing it in from a evac point is REAL nice and saves med time.  Again, if your not in a raiding guild, I would not pay for this spell.<br>
<br>
Fist of Karana<br>
AE and the range is limited.  Again, it has its uses and Id consider paying for it if you could get the timing down to quad.<br>
<br>
Regrowth of the Grove - I dont have this one - <br>
I dont have this spell. =(  Id pay less than POTG.  Its a nice spell.<br>
<br>
Legacy of Thorn<br>
drops off higher level mobs like those in the crypt of seb.  Its ok if you were to have a mad puller in velk labs and 3 melee with a cleric you and and enchanter.  OR 3 melee, bard, cleric and you.  I dont thinnk id pay for it. <br>
<br>
<br>
Spirit of Oak - I dont have this one - I would not pay for this spell.<br>
<br>
Banishment I have yet to find a use for this spell or use it.  It requires a reg and you dont get exp right?<br>
<br>
Entrapping Roots This is an AE root with a damage componet.  If your not careful you will find yourself rooted. P<br>
<br>
Form of the Hunter - I dont have this one - This does not give mana right?  not sure if it stacks with mask.  Im not sure if Id pay for it.  Id prolly use es bracer for the run ablity, UNLESS I was pulling.<br>
<br>
Mask of the Hunter - I dont have this one - Id pay for this one to.  Id pay less than what Id pay for POTG or regrowth.<br>

Snagged 4-5 with snare, resisted on the other.
