I'll add a blonde joke.<br>
<br>
Three women escaped from prison. One was a redhead, one a brunette, and one a blonde. They ran for miles until they came upon an old barn where they decided to hide in the hayloft and rest. When they climbed up, they found three large gunnysacks and decided to climb into them for camouflage. <br>
<br>
About an hour later the sheriff and his deputy came into the barn. The sheriff told his deputy to go up and check out the hayloft. When he got up there the sheriff asked him what he saw and the deputy yelled back, &quot;Just three gunnysacks.&quot; <br>
<br>
The sheriff told him to find out what was in them, so the deputy kicked the first sack, which had the redhead in it. She went, &quot;Bow-wow,&quot; so the deputy told the sheriff there was a dog in it. <br>
<br>
Then he kicked the sack with the brunette in it. She went, &quot;Meow,&quot; so the deputy told the sheriff there was a cat in it. <br>
<br>
Then he kicked the one with the blonde in it, and there was no sound at all. So he kicked it again, and finally the blonde said, &quot;Potatoes.&quot;  <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>
