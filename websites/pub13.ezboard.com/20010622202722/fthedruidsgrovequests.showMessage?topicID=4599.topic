<br>
If the REAL VS is up...he must be killed...<br>
<br>
Then some time after killing (in my experience it was around 24 hours, but others claim there is a chance of a spawn at 12 hours) VS remains will spawn in the prep room and wander between the prep room and VS's chambers.<br>
<br>
When VS remains are up, the way to spawn the triggered version of Venril Sathir is this:<br>
<br>
1) First of all VS remains is NON-AGGRO...make sure your entire party knows that he is NOT to be touched.  If someone decides to take a whack at him...let them die...then rez.  If you find him in the prep room, then hail him every 30 seconds or so to keep him from wandering off<br>
<br>
2) Clear the 3 or 4 spawns around the prep room behind the doors and such so that you do not get any additionals during the fight.<br>
<br>
3) give VS remains a &quot;globe of fireflies&quot;--yes that item that is created from the &quot;Dance of the Fireflies&quot; spell that druids get at level 1 and rangers get at a level I don't know.  This will turn him into &quot;Spirit of Venril Sathir&quot; (looks like a curate).  Again he is NON-AGGRO<br>
<br>
4) Give Spirit of VS a 49th level cleric resurrection spell that can be bought at any cleric guild.  This will spawn a lower version of Venril and that is your target.  A recommendation that I have read recently that I think is good is to give the spell scroll to your main tank to hand in.  The tank immediately gets aggroed.<br>
<br>
5) Kill VS.  He is a level 55 Necro, hits for 300-400 and MAY lifetap single targets for 1500.  It has been reported that he has been killed without a single lifetap.  I killed him last night, and the two party deaths were from lifetaps.  Be prepared for them.  1-2 groups of high levels should be plenty.  Enchanter runes for tanks and wizzies for lures are good.  I debuffed his FR and got a Scoriae to hit full, and a level 60 druid friend got a Wildfire to hit full.<br>
<br>
6) When killed he drops two stones<br>
<br>
After he goes down, again 24 hours later (or maybe 12--I never saw a 12 hours spawn though) VS remains will repop.  This will continue until 3 days after the initial REAL VS went down.  If it is 3 days later, then another REAL VS will spawn.  This starts another cycle.<br>
<br>
What can be a problem is that the people that kill the real VS often waltz into KC claiming the VSR spawn that occurs 24 hours although there may have been a group hunting in the prep room for the last 8 hours awaiting the spawn.  On my PVP server this has caused deaths and guildwars.<br>
<br>
Be patient...have friends ready to jump at a moments notice and you may get lucky.  Otherwise organize a VS raid and claim the spawn 24 hours later.<br>
<br>
Either way good luck with getting your stones!<br>

I would only add one thing.  The globe can ONLY be summoned at night.  If you're going to camp VS remains, then have your res scroll on you, and summon that globe the first time you can.  That way, you wont be stuck staring at VS remains while you wait for nightfall.<br>

VS was killed at 7 pm and VSR was up at noon the next day so it isn't a 22-26 hour spawn like I thought. He quad hits for 330 according to the 59th Pally I begged to help me. We didn't have any lifetaps but I still went into debt repaying my chanter for peridots :) I handed in both items myself with no problems. He agroed on the tanks immediately. We had two groups and only one cleric, all between 52 and 59, but no deaths luckily. He's a toughie. All I can say is that if you see him on radar, start calling in people immediately! He won't last long.<br>

Either way apparently works fine...<br>
<br>
Take your choice...turn in the scroll yourself or hand it to your tank to hand in...<br>
<br>
My reasoning to have the tank do it was because he sometimes lifetaps.  If he decided to aggro on me right away and lifetap me...I'm done.  Then lets say it's the 1 in 1000 chance that I go LD while zoning (it's happened to me on cable).  Then if I don't get back in game and rezzed it's bye bye stone.<br>

<br>
That may very weell be the answer to why he sometimes spawns the same day....how about this? Has anyone seen where he spawned less than 22 hour after a TRIGGERED VS? Or has it only been less than 22 hours after the REAL VS? <br>
<br>
Yesterday as I was watching for im, the real VS spawned, so I gave it up, and called it a day...went to do something else. Then a few hours later (like 6 or so), I found out the triggered VS had just been killed. I couldn't figured how he had spawned in such a short time, but the above explanation might cover it...Thoughts? <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>
