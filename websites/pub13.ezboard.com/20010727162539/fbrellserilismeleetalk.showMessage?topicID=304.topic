They are so flexible, and thier strengths far outweigh thier weaknesses. Paladins are excellent combatants with the divine healing powers of a cleric (to a lesser degree). Rangers are the blade masters of nature, using the magic of the earth, fire, and wind to aid thier fights. ShadowKnights are the perilous evil twins to the Paladins, using thier dark magic of necromancy to reduce thier foes to feeble whelps.<br>
<br>
As a Paladin, I've always considered myself the Holy Knight, protector of what is Just, Honorable, and Chivalrous. I've always roleplayed Fenye as a hot tempered, brash, loud, and somewhat arrogant High Elf Paladin. On the other hand, she has a good heart, and believes in fairness and is always willing to lend a helping hand or dollar if able. (lately, all that has changed, but that's a whole new story, it's part of her retirement)<br>
<br>
I was just wondering, for all you Paladins, Rangers and Shadow Knights out there, how do you view your character? Is your Shadow Knight a distrustful, unloyal rogue who slays any who crosses your path? A Ranger who has vowed never to harm an animal, and focuses on purging Norrath of the monstrous beasts such as the Giants, Gnolls, and Kobolds from harming natures precious creations?<br>
<br>
Put a post here, and leave a description of what your character means to you, how you play em, and what his/her qualities are. It'd just be interesting to see how many evil paladins and noble shadowknights we come up with :P<br>

His sister, Lyri, is the only reason he is still around, fighting for his life and for the lives of the others around him.  Once upon a time, Faraque was an emerald warrior and he traveled the world in search of adventure.  For 14 seasons he walked the old familiar paths that many have walked before.  Then one fateful day, Faraque crossed an old man speaking in riddles of a fountain of youth.  Well, him wanting to be the first to find and explore it, he immediately ran off in search.  Lo and behold he found it, deep within the moutains of Steamfont.  There he drank of the spring and found that in truth it did indeed make him younger.  Unfortunately, it also had the unknown side effect of making his memories of who he was and what he was, leave as well.  His sister, Lyri, took him by hand to her trainer in the ways of the woods and begged him to teach her brother and make him whole again.  After a long and grueling time, Faraque was reborn.  His skills he learned as a warrior never fully returned and he began learning about the forest and how to use it to his advantage.  He became a tracker, and an archer.  He hunted the orcs that hated him.  He hunted the wisps that drained the land of magic.  He hunted all that destroyed the lands Tunare blessed him to be able to see and remember.  To this day, he will not destroy any of Tunare's blessed kin and has done his best to insure that none do this as well.  Together with a small group of friends, he formed the guild, Eternal Friends, hoping that never again would he lose a friend that cared about him or that he cared about.<br>
<br>
((Ok, now to the real explanation...   I was playing as a wood elf warrior for a while on a friends account and then I got told to get my own account and start over.  I was a level 14 warrior and that hurt, having to start over.  But I got back on my two feet and recreated my first character, Faraque, and made him a ranger, as the warrior class just did not suit his attitude.  Now I have finally gotten back to my previous level and am much happier and hope to keep getting better and better.  I formed the guild to keep my friends together and stay close.  A few bad stories concerning that but all in all, so far so good.)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ugruiddadooid.showPublicProfile>Gruid Dadooid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fellow of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(6/27/00 10:25:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   alrighty, my main charecter gruid</span><hr size=1> alright, this is how gruid is. Not really the holy knight type, just a general nice guy who is kind to others. I try and help out others, but if I can't help them, and know that they are gonna die even if I help, which will most likely aggro the mob onto me and get my killed, I don't help. Gruid is the practical type. Not a jerk, just practical. Oh yeah, forgot to mention his class, he is a dwarven Paladin. Might as well explain the last name while I'm at it. Or at least the story I gave the GM. My father was a wood elf druid that was a womanizer, and he came upon my mother one night and....... well, you know. Anyways, because of that, my mother named me &quot;gruid,&quot; seeing as how that rhymed with druid and all. But then kids tormented me at school, calling me &quot;gruid da'druid&quot;(the name i wanted, but damn GM's wouldn't take it, grr....)<br>
<br>

Noble, arrogant, and honorable to a fault. I will stop and haul another from the grasp of the dangers of Norrath, only so that when the time comes, I may meet them on a proper, even field of battle, so that I might destroy them utterly and completely. As a Dark Elven Knight of Innoruuk, the simple death of all that belongs to the Light is not my goal, but I must also humiliate it, and make all the bipedal animals of Norrath, light skinned or dark, smooth, warty, or scaled,  feel true pain, fear, and above all, hatred. Only in the ashes of the old world can we build the perfect one.<br>
However, for those I've chosen as my friends upon Norrath, both light and dark, I will gladly lay down my mortal life, both so that they may continue, and so that they may see the true glory of Innoruuk... <br>
I will not beg or steal, nor will I strike under the cover of night from the back, for such are not the way to the true glory and power of hatred...<br>

Well, that's pretty close to being Arathena in a nutshell. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>--<br>

As a sworn paladin of Brell Serilis, I rise to the call of battle, and arm myself for war.<br>
<br>
A war that never ends against the hordes of darkness that crawls in the deepest most obscure regions.<br>
<br>
To die in the face of adversity, to stand fast and take the beating so my commarades may escape death themselves.<br>
<br>
Fighting until my limbs are so weary they feel as if having being melted.<br>
<br>
To be killed and come back for more, die again, and still come back for even more.<br>
<br>
Suffering in the worse condition punishment that would destroy a lesser man.<br>
<br>
Feeling the blade of monster slice my innards, and smell the copery flavor of my own blood pouring from my torn body, still screaming and fighting as the darkness threathens to engulf me.<br>

After the death of my brother, I have tracked and killed his murderer in his own Temple in Freeport.Deadly wounded, I escaped guards, hiding myself in the Commonlands...<br>
Here a young human Knight helped me against hounds and healed my wounds. He was a true knight, fighting for honour and friendship, after a while he said something strange: &quot;Even if your skin is black, you act like a Knight, and I am sure you have helped allot of peoples, bringing friendship in this land&quot;.<br>
<br>
I followed him during long weeks and one day he was involved in a fight to save a high elf attacked by four dark elf rogue...<br>
I was uncertain during a few seconds and he was killed, his last words were not a curse or angry outburst:<br>
&quot;Follow your heart Lady Knight, I see your pain, you cannot live filled with Hate, trust in my last words…&quot;<br>
<br>
I asked the rogues why they have killed them and they laugh at me,<br>
&quot;Was fun, human trash&quot;, one said.<br>
&quot;Bastards&quot;, said the second.<br>
&quot;You liked this human pig? &quot;, said the last one before my sword caught his heart…<br>
...<br>
<br>
I have finished our travel, visited the Halfling town, Birds Village, Icy lands of Halas, Deep Forest of Faydark, and fought for the memory of this great knight…<br>
I do not know my role here but I think I just want to be liked and accepted, not as a woman or a dark elf, but as a real knight fighting with Honour and for Friendship…<br>
