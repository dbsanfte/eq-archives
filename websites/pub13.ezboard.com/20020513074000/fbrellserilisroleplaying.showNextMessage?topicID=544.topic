He caught sight of her silken skirts as she dashed into a building out of the rain.  The downpour meant nothing to him, he was too busy being caught up in the moment.  It had been so long since she had been in his hand, since he had touched the dewy soft skin of her cheek.  A pain struck him as he remembered the torture he had been through to pay for his failure to the man who paid for the half elf’s capture. <br>
<br>
The hunter slid a strong hand inside his sleeve and toyed with the silken fragment she had left behind when she destroyed the bindings he had laid upon her.  The vividness of her burned his memory and he blamed her Goddess for that.  The touch of Love upon his skin was too much for the man who worshiped Hate.  <br>
<br>
Everything from the time he held her in the palm of his hand was etched in his memory.  He could close his eyes and smell the scent of the sun that lingered on her hair.  Reaching out his hand at night he felt the softness of her skin in front of him.  Then her voice, that soft, silken cascade of notes being issued forth through rose petal lips, it still captured his attention whenever he heard it.<br>
<br>
Never before had anything but his magic held his attention.  Even his God was never foremost in his mind, except by the desire of reaching out onto the plane of his realm and plucking his existance from the threads of that place for a few days of time.  Why would you worship a God if your plan was not to make yourself powerful enough to face him one day?  At least that was the reasoning in his mind behind the meaning of worship, to gain strength from one that would one day fall at his feet.<br>
<br>
One thing that touched him so deeply was the devotion of the bard’s Goddess to her.  Never had he seen a divine being react in the touching and honest way that Erollisi Marr did in retaliation for her Daughter’s care.  The feel of her power overwhelming him still woke him from dreams at night.  Seeing her form gently caring for his prisoner still burned in his mind whenever he closed his eyes for a moment.<br>
<br>
Even during the days it took him to recover his power was finding the bard foremost in his mind.  At first he told himself that only the completion of the contract that pushed him on, then gradually he knew that wasn’t true.  He needed to see what it was in her that touched a Goddess, and a man, so much as to want to care for her so deeply.  The power of the man that hired him still held him in awe at times, and to have a man that strong desire to control her, astounded him.  <br>
<br>
Over and over again he studied the weeks he had contained her.  In his mind he caught every movement she made, every sound that emanated from her soft lips.  Only as he studied his own actions in that time did he realize what made her so powerful.  She captured those around her, not the other way around.  The beauty in her songs, the proud carriage of her lush form, the love that filled her heart and allowed those around her to share it, all things that made her a treasure as he had never seen in Norrath before.<br>
<br>
Now he could see why so many people were drawn to her.  She cared openly about her friends and took care of them in return.  The men around her attracted by her beauty soon got to know the true gift she held inside and took her into their confidences.  As such she came away from most contacts with friends, not loves.  He snorted derisively at his thought, one with beauty such as hers should be cosseted and held close, worshiped much as her Goddess was, but these heathens she was around generally only saw a friend.  There was one man he watched that seemed to know the prize he held, and there were two others that sat in the wings, awaiting their chance to act. <br>
<br>
One of the men that waited was the person that originally contacted him.  No one questioned his motives, but the desire to own the bard must have been drawn from long ago.  The punishment doled upon his hunter was too harsh for just losing his quarry.  He had fulfilled many contracts for this man and had never seen the passion with which he reacted to the news of her loss in him before.  In fact, they had known each other most of their lives, and never before had he seen a show of any emotion from his acquaintance, let alone one that was unleashed like a hurricane at the news of her escape.<br>
<br>
The other was the hunter himself.  As he followed her again he realized how much he could never give away what was once in his possession.  The light of her beauty and devotion shined brightly in his dark life.  Anytime he came in contact with something of hers his mind reeled with the desire to touch her again.  Never before had any person touched him inside at all.  <br>
<br>
There had been women that he had taken and used, but none that he wanted to covet.  The bard was different, everything he knew now centered on her.  Even new contracts he took upset him at the thought of having to leave her pursuit behind.  Now any woman that he saw paled in comparison to the beauty the bard held in his eyes, her hand was the only touch he craved now.<br>
<br>
The hunter had not made new plans to capture her as he was sure he couldn’t hold her again against her will.  But his new plan would be more perfect, he would not hold her against his will.  She would come to him willingly, openly, sharing her passions with him.  He smiled wolfishly, his white teeth showing against the shadows of the night.  She would be his one day, he would feel her skin again under his hand, but this time she would moan with pleasure, not tremble in fear.<br>
