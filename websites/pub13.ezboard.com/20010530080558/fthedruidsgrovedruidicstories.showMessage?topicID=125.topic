The first and foremost reason was because I just wasn’t up to creating something. I just didn’t have the heart to make a story. I turned my log on just in case something funny happened, but nothing did. It was the most boring plane raid I have ever gone on. I mean, it was cool hanging out with everyone…but we lacked a certain something. So I decided to liven it up with…ass jokes. <br>
<br>
OK, OK…before you even start into me, I just want to make it perfectly clear that fart jokes ARE funny, regardless of how old you are. I wanted to title this story – Plane of Delaware Disco Raid – but it lacked substance. So, without any further explanation of why I made the story in the fashion I did, I think I’ll just leave it up to you, the reader, to decide for yourself why I did it this way. Oh, who am I kidding, this is a stupid ass story and I shouldn’t have even wasted my time doing it. But, since I spent 2 hours on it I may as well post it.<br>
<br>
Before you read any further I want to make something perfectly @#%$ clear. I write @#%$ the way I want to write it. If you have some little kid you don’t want seeing adult themes then turn this @#%$ off right now and go away. If you are easily offended by vulgar language and fart jokes, turn back now! I make no apologies for writing what I write and those of you who do not like it can lick the sweat out of my hairy ass crack!<br>
<br>
With that said, I just want to state that I have in no way altered the screenshots. This is how they turned out after I opened the EQ program file. I couldn’t believe it myself when I saw them. This must be like the 10th wonder of the world or something. Anyway, without further ado, here is the story…<br>
<br>
We found ourselves gathered on the Wizard’s Spire in South Ro. It was a festive gathering and everyone seemed to be in high spirits.<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h01.jpg><br>
<br>
We eventually found a small Gnome in our group and he asked us, “You jerkies ready for little Plane of Disco action?” I was all over it. We were a small hearty band of merry disco club go’ers and, damn it, we wanted to shake our booties! <br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h02.jpg><br>
<br>
Upon arrival into the Plane of Disco, we noticed that nobody was out walking around. There was no audible disco music. We didn’t even see a disco ball. Tensions ran high. Tempers flared. Small rodents were sacrificed, as a testament of the anger felt deep inside every person in the group.<br>
<br>
Alas, off in the distance we saw a sign of hope…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h03.jpg><br>
<br>
Excellent! We found a place to shake our asses. Problem is, this city was huge and a little confusing to navigate. We asked a local how to get there…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h04.jpg><br>
<br>
Sweet! That guy was pretty cool. He was also wearing some pretty killer bell-bottom and a butterfly collared shirt. For the time being, we were gathering our thoughts and hanging out on the street corner…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h05.jpg><br>
<br>
You see, with disco and those who partake in the ways of disco, you can not rush yourself to the scene of groovy music and pretty colored disco lights. You must first hang out on a street corner and enjoy every waking second with those around you. Now that you are in the know, I can proceed with this story without fear of you being ignorant to the ways of disco.<br>
<br>
So, there we were, hanging out of the corner and up walks this chest…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h06.jpg><br>
<br>
We were thinking, “Now, THIS is pretty cool. A box that displays colors AND plays funky music. Can this be the beginning of a fabulous night of disco?” These thoughts and so many more came to our wee minds when all of a sudden some dude popped out of the box after we kick it a few times.<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h07.jpg><br>
<br>
At first we felt threatened by this dude. He was superior in the ways of pelvic-gyration. He wore cool threads and he was a jive turkey. So we were like, “Hey, let’s see what this guy does.”<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h08.jpg><br>
<br>
This guy had some KILLER moves! We knew that if we took him to the club that all the girls he didn’t want to take home with him would probably want to go home with the rest of us. It was a win/win situation. So, we asked him to tag along…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h09.jpg><br>
<br>
We started walking down the street in the direction that other jive turkey told us to go. Out of nowhere, this punk ass Disco Nazi jumps us!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h10.jpg><br>
<br>
We were like, “Dude! WTF!? We are from Jersey! You can’t talk to us like that! We’ll talk @#%$ about you with a funny accent!”<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h11.jpg><br>
<br>
This Disco Nazi dude was a complete ass. At first we couldn’t believe he was trying to police our actions. But, after looking at this attire, we came to the collective conclusion that he was totally un-hip and he therefore he to be killed.<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h12.jpg><br>
<br>
Ceela got so worked up over the death of a Disco Nazi that she started running around screaming, “Look at my tits!!! Look at my tits!!” So we were like, “Yeah, show us your tits!! Show us your tits!!”<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h13.jpg><br>
<br>
I got so worked up looking at Ceela’s tits that I didn’t notice some bastard casting Root on me. <br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h14.jpg><br>
<br>
Personally I thought that was really fucked up. They left me there for almost 3 minutes as they pretended to walk away. Fuckers.<br>
<br>
On the way to the disco, we met ANOTHER dude. He was dressed in this sweet leisure suit.<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h15.jpg><br>
<br>
He was chillin’ on the corner when we walked up to him. Out of no where this sweet disco music blasted through some speakers from the business next door. This guy started dancing like no other we had ever seen!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h16.jpg><br>
<br>
We were all so impressed that we started checking ourselves out. We had to make sure that we looked our best because there was obviously no way we were going to be able to compete with his moves. As we were checking out our buddies, I noticed a glaring…something…that was not right…on Xantheus’ face…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h17.jpg><br>
<br>
After we got Xantheus cleaned up, we continued our pilgrimage to the disco club. A good 30 minutes later, we found it…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h18.jpg><br>
<br>
The music coming out of this disco club we getting our juices flowing, some more than others…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h19.jpg><br>
<br>
Poor guy. Anyway, we started walking into the bar when this Ass Mistress jumped us! Darsan was immediately accosted…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h20.jpg><br>
<br>
We were like, ‘Dude! You can’t throw @#%$ in someone’s eye! That just ain’t cool!” We circled around the Ass Mistress and out of nowhere I saw this HUGE ass…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h21.jpg><br>
<br>
Anyway, we started roughing her up a little. Out of nowhere, she starts farting on people!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h22.jpg><br>
<br>
I was stymied! I couldn’t believe this Ass Mistress was being so rude!! My buddy Brynshar was sitting in front of me when out of nowhere…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h23.jpg><br>
<br>
We just could not believe she was doing this to us! This was a completely unprovoked ass attack! But we are hearty disco club go’ers from Jersey and we don’t take @#%$…errrr…whatever from anybody!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h24.jpg><br>
<br>
 Just when we thought our verbal taunting was getting the better of her…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h25.jpg><br>
<br>
She was single handedly kicking the crap out of us! Her ass powers were like none we had ever seen! We thought it to be a prudent move to send in the big dog. When duty calls, Duty comes running!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h26.jpg><br>
<br>
She actually fired a turd rocket down Duty’s throat! To this very day, Duty hasn’t been ‘quite right in the head’.<br>
<br>
Feeling this was a losing situation, we stepped back to assess our options. Out of nowhere she decides to finish us off with her secret weapon…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h27.jpg><br>
<br>
Well, OK. We knew how much damage it could do so it really wasn’t a secret. However, it is kinda hard to have a story like this an not include some form of ‘secret weapon’…even if we already knew about it and what effects it has.<br>
<br>
We were stuck. We were hopeless. She had nearly defeated half the group when out of nowhere…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h28.jpg><br>
<br>
SWEET!! We found her weakness!<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h29.jpg><br>
<br>
After nullifying her ass with the soothing sounds of the Bee Gees we quickly took her down, removed her ass for scientific study and then killed her. The music grew louder and louder from the club. Patrons had started pouring out to see what all of the commotion was about during the Ass Mistress episode. One dude…one dude…well, see for yourself…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h30.jpg><br>
<br>
I was like, “Whoa! That guy is a horn dog…errrr….something!” I felt that the night was saved and that the asses of the world would no longer hold us, the hearty disco club go’ers fron Jersey, down any longer! No longer would ass wield supreme executive power! No! No more! From now on, DISCO was our king! DOWN WITH ASS!! In with DISCO! WOOT! I don’t think Genma was amused…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h31.jpg><br>
<br>
But it didn’t matter. We just exiled Genma to the boring section of the street outside of the disco and taunted him…<br>
<br>
<img src=http://64.176.56.195/eqpics/h32.jpg><br>
<br>
The rest of the night was filled with the sounds of disco, funk bass guitar and the sweet sounds of flatulence. And, yes, we got the left-over chicks that one jive turkey left behind, not that we were complaining.<br>
