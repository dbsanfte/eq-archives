His crystalline eyes shimmering softly in the mid-day sun.  He was content.  Living in Qeynos again, without the hassle his adventures had brought.  Life was easy, and he had few worries.  He enjoyed visiting the market daily, and sharing tales of his adventures with the younger adventurers around the gates of Northern Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Xican wandered aimlessly toward the bank, stopping short of the Warrior's guild to greet his friend, Cossin.  Cossin was one of the Qeynos guards, and had known Xican for nearly 15 years.  The two talked and laughed as Xican accompanied Cossin on his patrol route.  They were wandering around the back of the warrior guild, when an abrupt stop by Cossin caused Xican to slowly glance up to what appeared to be a small blockade of guards.  Xican's brow quirked a moment, quickly commenting, &quot;Friends of yours, Cossin?&quot;  Cossin didn't reply, but simply shook his head.<br>
<br>
Xican quickly recognized them as guards he'd investigated for being corrupt, long ago.  He knew they were, but couldn't prove a thing, yet.  Xican decided it best he break the silence.  &quot;Can I help you with something, guys?&quot;.  The 6 guards didn't say a word.  Xican, with a coy grin crossing his lips exclaimed after a moment's silence.  &quot;Excellent, since you don't need anything, kindly get the hell out of my way.&quot;  with that Xican and Cossin stepped toward the guard's intending to pass them with out dispute.  The 6 guard's were now clear to Xican, even beneath their helmets.  Whissen, Stolk, Brinith, Willand, Tithiir, and Rilin.<br>
<br>
Xican and Cossin came to a stop, again, noticing the 6 had formed a circle around them.  With little warning Xican's head tilted to the left, a blade singing by his right ear.  Xican's right arm quickly flung up, the elbow thrusting back in to the bridge of Rilin's nose.  The brutal sound of bone breaking was followed closely by Rilin's screams of pain, as he fell to his knees, his sword falling, while his hands instinctively covered his face, grimacing in pain, blood trickling through his fingers and to the concrete, slowly.  Rilin's helmet dented in to his flesh.<br>
<br>
Xican stayed unmoving, facing the two guards in front of him.  Cossin quickly turned, drawing his Velium Long sword, a gift from Xican.  Cossin wasted no time.  He quickly lunged forward, his right arm extending, and plunging the blade in to Whissen's gut.  The sword screeched as the blade penetrated the thick plate armor.  Whissen fell quickly, crumpling on the side of street, his body twitching slightly.  Cossin turning to Tithiir, was just in time to duck beneath the blade of the short sword.  Quickly rising, Cossin drew his velium blade across the unprotected throat of Tithiir.  Tithiir gasped, his hands rising to his throat, fingers wrapping around his severed jugular.  He crumpled to his side, choking for air.  Cossin, coldly spoke down to Tithiir on the ground.  &quot;If you clog the artery with your finger, it'll stop the bleeding...You'll still suffocate, though.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cossin turned slowly to find Stolk, Brinith, and Willand dead on the ground.  His attention slowly turned to Xican, who was watching Rilin on the ground, still whimpering over his nose, which had formed a nice pool of blood beneath him.  Rilin eventually looked up to the two before immediately jumping to his feet and sprinting toward the bank.  Xican shrugged, content to let him escape with his life.  Suddenly a green bolt struck Rilin's back, his body withering almost instantly, and his life drained from him.  Rilin fell to the ground, his body wrinkled and brittle, as if his life had been sucked from him.<br>
<br>
Xican sighed softly, his body turning to find Lieutenant Dagarok 20 feet in front of him.  Cossin turned around, glancing to Xican, and then to Dagarok.  He grumbled inaudibly before speaking in a tired, almost frightened tone.  &quot;Don't do it Xican.  He's not worth it.  You can't...&quot;  He stopped before completing his sentence, glancing up for a moment.<br>
<br>
Xican, as if he hadn't heard a single thing Cossin said, glanced to his friend.  &quot;How the hell did he do that?  He sucked the life right out of that poor Fellow.  I mean really...How?&quot;  Xican grinned contently, adding, &quot;You know what...I'm gonna go ask him.&quot;  Cossin immediately grimaced before he looked to Xican, knowing his nature.  &quot;Alright, Xican.  I can't come with you though, friend...&quot;  With that, Cossin quickly turned, and walked away.  Xican only nodded.<br>
<br>
Dagarok and Xican only stood across from one another, staring the other down.  Xican was the first to move.  He nodded to Dagarok, perhaps out of respect for his strength.  The two had fought before.  Dagarok had left Xican unconscious in a single blow.  It wasn't much of a contest, at all.  That was so long ago, and Xican had learned a lot in this time.  But would it matter?<br>
<br>
Xican taking action sprinted toward Dagarok.  As he neared Dagarok, Xican leaped forward, his right foot lashing out, and slamming against Dagarok's jaw line.  Dagarok stumbled back, his helmet falling loose, and hitting the concrete noisily.  He regained his footing before glancing to Xican, who stood proud, a mischievous grin upon his lips.  Dagarok cursed under his breath, before retaliating.  His right hand struck out, the clenched fist hitting Xican's cheek.  Dagarok's knuckles cut in to Xican's cheek, the flesh swelling almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Before Xican could recover from Dagarok's initial blow, another fist struck his chin.  Xican again stumbled back.  Again, Dagarok's right fist came crashing down upon his cheek.  The skin where Dagarok had struck split upon impact.  Blood began to trickle from the swollen flesh.  Xican was still reeling from the barrage of punches, until he felt Dagarok's knee dig in to his gut.  The knee threw Xican back, gasping for air until he hit the ground, landing on his stomach.<br>
<br>
Xican began to pick himself up off the ground.  His head rising for a moment, only to see Dagarok's boot plant firmly in to his lip, throwing Xican on to his back.  Xican slowly rose to his feet.  Xican's eyes lifted to Dagarok as he stood, only in time to feel cold steel find it's home in his gut!  Xican screamed out in pain, eyes falling to the jagged spear's blade resting in his gut.  Xican felt his heart sink, as Dagarok began to laugh maniacally, quickly jerking the spear inside Xican, before ripping it up, and pulling the blade from Xican.<br>
<br>
Xican fell to the ground, his stomach nothing but a gap.  Blood poured from his sides, a large slash up his chest.  Xican's lips parted to scream, but only vomit came.  He had been through so much in his life.  For it all to end here, like this.  It just couldn't.<br>
<br>
Xican screamed aloud.  His eyes snapped open as he sat up in bed.  A cold sweat overtook his body, as crystalline eyes traced slowly over to the window.  He could see Dagarok standing outside the window, simply laughing.  Rolling thunder crackled over head, as Xican stared out at the rain.  Constantly thinking to himself.  It was just a dream....<br>
