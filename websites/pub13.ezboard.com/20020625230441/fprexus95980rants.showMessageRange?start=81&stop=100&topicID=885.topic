<br>
Sure it does Cisne, it spreads it via EC by guilds that no longer need anything from those mobs but stayed on the rotation.  Take a look at the Trading forum...see if you can find any uber guild banker selling BPs and Legs.  Now try to find a Stasis banker doing the same.  Who really needs trak and VS?  Thought so. <p>Adax Wrax, lvl 60<br>

<br>
When I talk about a resource, I mean the fun and enjoyment of a major encounter.  A raid with friends and guildmates.  The feeling one gets when one is AWARDED a piece of coveted loot, that one fought alongside compatriots to get.  People may be able to purchase loot, but you can't sell them the fun.<br>
<br>
Pretty telling that you immediately interpreted the term resource to mean items, and addressed my point only on that basis. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usto0ge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StO0gE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/11/02 10:51:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calenders, Rotation and Raids, oh my!</span><hr size=1> you all keep thinking you know so much about Stasis heh..<br>

<br>
  Hey i have said it once and i will say it again...  Dont rely on something that is not reliable...<br>
<br>
We have seen the end of the rotations.. we will soon see the end of these rants..<br>
The only regrets i have on being involved with bringing down the rotations is watching Kamchak and Sneer waste their time, i feel sorry that they worked on the rotation site tried to keep things updated.. when it was just a waste.<br>
<br>
read my posts before this if you want to know what i have to say..  im done on this thread because it seems to of become a who wants the last word thread, and im just repeating myself.<br>

<br>
the problem is... is that the rotations system that has been on prexus was and is flawed...<br>
<br>
you have certain guilds saying that whatever guilds that they deem worthy enough are the only ones allowed to be on the rotation...<br>
<br>
that is just one thing that is wrong... as there were several capable guilds able to be on the rotation... yet they had to prove themselves anyway... to these 'uber guilds' that they were worthy enough to be included in the reindeer games of prexus...<br>
<br>
no guild on prexus should have to prove themselves to another guild...  if we get thier first we should be able to take a shot at them... regardless what anybody, guild, or Verant wants to say about it....<br>
<br>
second and the the most important...<br>
<br>
there is no way to enforce a rotation/calander system.... there is nothing a 'player' and or 'guild' can do to anyone who violates 'Prexus Player Rules' unless it violates Verant policy...<br>
you can sanction all you want... but there is about 3000 'players' on this server who dont care, dont know, and support FCFS... who will still provide rezzes, sow, teleports and make anything item they will wish.....<br>
<br>
third<br>
<br>
the mobs and the 2 zones in question are directly related to Quest and/or epic pieces for certain classes...  (Naggy-Zordak for instance)  this in itself creates a problem already...  but then add rotations to the mix.. and it creates a bigger problem.....<br>
<br>
you say we need to care about other people... well i am... i care for my guilds 2 clerics sitting on thier ass in Sol waiting in line for the Zordak spawn....  while everyone trys to figure out who is next on rotation for naggy..  if they still exist... if they are capable... or how long it will take for them to find enough people to be able to attempt an attack...<br>
<br>
all the while clerics are waiting.... hoping someone out there does something so it doesnt prolong their wait....<br>
<br>
this takes away the enjoyment of other players... also....<br>
<br>
4th reason<br>
<br>
I dont remember giving anyone permission to tell me what to do... other then the people i pay my $10 a month too...<br>
<br>
while i do agree rotations would be nice...  there is just no way to implement, enforce, or punish anyone who violates these 'Prexus Player Laws' .....<br>
<br>
Stasis is pushing FCFS... and not only Stasis but ALOT of other guilds also want FCFS....  some of the others have already taken a FCFS stance... just people do not make a big deal about it... as they like to do with Stasis... as everyone tried to turn Stasis into thier Whipping boy... or try to make them an Example.... when that failed... they got angry...<br>
<br>
Like i said before...  you may not like it... but you only have 3 choices here...  live with it, quit EQ, or complain....  ethier way... NO ONE WILL CARE WHAT YOU DO...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellisorian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellisorian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.unityeq.org/images/sigs/sneer.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/11/02 11:53:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calenders, Rotation and Raids, oh my!</span><hr size=1> Edit-I continually promise myself to shut up but I never do.  <p><img src="http://www.unityeq.org/images/sigs/sneer3.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellisorian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellisorian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.unityeq.org/images/sigs/sneer.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/11/02 11:53:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadaxwrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adax Wrax</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/12/02 12:10:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.bsc.net/dbaldwin/adaxhead.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calenders, Rotation and Raids, oh my!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;The feeling one gets when one is AWARDED a piece of coveted loot...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Stooge, you can claim all you want about how wonderful Stasis and all its members is.  You can shout from the mountaintops and sing the praises of everyone from Nasir on down.  You act all wounded, claiming no one &quot;knows&quot; what you're like, and why you do what you do.  The problem is, the reasons don't make what you do ok.  The people who have problems with the way Stasis went about this see the actions, and that's all they need to see to form their opinions.<br>
<br>
You keep talking about facts, facts, facts, and say that anyone who disagrees with you is working off opinions.  Just what facts do you have, anyway?  What do you think is so damn factual that justifies what your guild has done?  There are NO facts that take the place of the facts of your deeds; they stand in and of themselves, displaying what Stasis really is all about.<br>
<br>
Everyone else is entitled to their opinions of your actions.  Claiming they don't have &quot;facts&quot; is just lame.   You HAVE no facts, Stooge.  You have your OPINIONS about FCFS and how to play EQ.  Other people have their own opinions about the same issues.  So stop trying to make your arguments untouchable by attempting to trump opinions with your so-called &quot;facts&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucisnethornheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cisne Thornheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/12/02 1:37:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=88>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Calenders, Rotation and Raids, oh my!</span><hr size=1> &quot;GRATS guild bank on another Deepwater BP!

 The facts are nobody controls @#%$.. and nobody can tell anyone what to do or how to play unless your from Verant.<br>
<br>
 The facts are that everyone is all talk about things but never make any actions and when stasis made actions all hell broke loose... but nobody looked at the real reasons stasis did what they did and have been doing..   and nobody is pissing on the people who quietly support fcfs..<br>
<br>
 The facts are the rotations had major flaws.<br>
 <br>
  The facts are  Everything is Fcfs/ffa (if you want) now anyway so it is pointless to rant and b!tch on prexus.com about it.<br>
<br>
  The facts are most people just dont give a damn anymore about anything..  sounds like an opinion right there but that is a damn fact.<br>
<br>
 The facts are Stasis as a guild said and i quote &quot; Stasis is FCFS for better or worse &quot;..  so people should expect their rotations not to go so perfect if a guild doesnt believe in the rotations...<br>
<br>
  The facts are that as much as people say how selfish and inconsiderate we are and no matter how many people have their opinions on Stasis's gameplay..  we wont stop the way we play.. because we believe we are playing Normal..  <br>
 <br>
 We believe we are playing Normal by FCFS... Just like most of you believed you were playing normal by rotating mobs..   Its all a matter of not seeing eye to eye..  and Stasis doesnt see eye to eye with Prexus.<br>
<br>
 Cisne I dont know who you are.. what guild you are from or anything and it doesnt matter because I am pretty sure you dont know me.   But I am here defending my guild, because thats what I feel i have to do all the time.. and maybe thats a big problem considering I end up heated.  Not many people from stasis post and i think that is a good thing.. most posts are just crappy jokes.. or insecure peeps flamin and fighting back against someone elses flames.  But i am here only to defend and not to be aggresive and hold some crusade against people and their belief's.<br>
<br>
  There are many facts.. and alot of people ignore them..  These threads are full of opinions, and i never said opinions are bad things because we all have our own opinions on EVERYTHING.  I am saying it is very hard to see where people are coming from when all the post are their opinions..  I have a hard time trying to see what people are trying to prove sometimes when all they are doing are shouting out their opinions.<br>
<br>
It is all just a bunch of ranting and complaining.. But hey this is the rant section..  Im sorry i was late to realize how pointless it is to argue with you people anymore about this DEAD situation.  <br>

<br>
The facts are nobody controls @#%$.. and nobody can tell anyone what to do or how to play unless your from Verant.<br>
<br>
-- Not true. Guild leaders and officers consistently dictate how members should behave and set policies on guild invitation etc. Basically it just means, if you don't want to follow the rules, your not part of the club.  So, I can say, Stooge, if you don't do this for me, your out of Stasis. I'm telling you what to do.

---Arguable. The system worked for a year. What you consider flaws, other people may consider benefits. For example, you say it makes you wait and dictate what you do with your time, I rename that to it is an amicable way to share a mob. <br>
<br>
The facts are Everything is Fcfs/ffa (if you want) now anyway so it is pointless to rant and b!tch on prexus.com about it.<br>
---Arguable. You never know if there will be a groundswell of support for rotations suddenly, or some massive thing changes. I agree with you of course, but still. You never know! I always leave in the ability to eat my own words.  and does it have a point to complain? Maybe. Maybe this is just formenting battle lines. Or maybe it really is doing nothing :). <br>
<br>
<br>
The facts are most people just dont give a damn anymore about anything.. sounds like an opinion right there but that is a damn fact.<br>
--Once again, I say this is arguable if I wish to be picky. I do give many damns about many things.<br>
<br>
The facts are Stasis as a guild said and i quote " Stasis is FCFS for better or worse ".. so people should expect their rotations not to go so perfect if a guild doesnt believe in the rotations...<br>
--The facts are stasis as a guild said,"Stasis is FCFS for better or for worse." Should have ended there. Who knows, maybe if I had tried harder to bring Jerm "back into the fold" so to speak, he would have rejoined. He was part of it once. He posted an apology. In hindsight, I can with general accuracy say that even if had managed to convince Jerm, it probably would not have worked out in the future. /shrug. Opinion really.<br>
<br>
The facts are that as much as people say how selfish and inconsiderate we are and no matter how many people have their opinions on Stasis's gameplay.. we wont stop the way we play.. because we believe we are playing Normal.. <br>
---Not totally true. I am pretty sure at least *some* members have left stasis due to the FCFS issue, or outside pressure. I remember Xiel? having some major trouble with his friends. So while Stasis as a guild may never stop, individuals may. Enough individuals stop, and the guild stops. If every person on prexus sent every person in stasis repeated tells about how bad they were, I'm sure something would have happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cisne I dont know who you are.. what guild you are from or anything and it doesnt matter because I am pretty sure you dont know me.<br>
<br>
--Cisne is in Ktf? I believe<br>
<br>
 But I am here defending my guild, because thats what I feel i have to do all the time.. and maybe thats a big problem considering I end up heated. <br>
---Your right :). Just stop defending bud. Theres no point. There will always be ways to nitpick, and there are always people who do it, even , god forbid, me. <br>
<br>
<br>
Lets just leave it Stoogers. Theres no point in arguing over message boards, and I've seen these same arguments 100 times. <p><img src="http://www.unityeq.org/images/sigs/sneer3.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellisorian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellisorian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.unityeq.org/images/sigs/sneer.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/02 5:49:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uidgetturd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IdgetTurd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/12/02 6:26:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The Evil Seed ?</span><hr size=1> What I think is funny is people say stuff like "OMG Stasis is FCFS , that means we will never get to Hate/Fear without having to deal with them OMG" When was the last time Stasis did those planes ? <br>
<br>
People say "OMG they ruin the smaller guilds fun by killing all the mobs" I have only seen a FEW guilds, no SMALL guilds, try to accomplish any of the things Stasis have, but yet some want these mobs on rotation why? To get a divine intervention and they notice they cant even try to do these mobs and only waste EVERYONES time? Im not talking about Trak/VS or Fear/Hate.... Stasis does those when there is enough need to go down there and kill them. They are a joke, but needed when epics or keys are needed. <br>
<br>
<br>
But that leads to "OMG Stasis is so greedy and selfish!" Thats a bunch of BS. Stasis want to move on, and was forced to wait to move on cause of rotations. When X guild does a Trak raid and gives the teeth to people thier guild that will probably never make it to VP over Y guild killing Trak for the teeth so they can get thier guildmates to join them in another zone is GREED. Sure , you might need the teeth down the road, say 8 or 10 months after you finish the quest and get enough people to go with you. Yah thats cool , but why make someone wait that can use the tooth for a key THEN and THERE. Need before Greed anyone?<br>
<br>
And of course then there is the "OMG Stasis just FCFS'd OUR dragon , that is SO unfair !" Unfair? How? Stasis killed a mob that we needed over a guild that probably was killing for the loots and self gratification of being able to brag that they did it. Stasis ruined your fun? How? Oh yeah , you had that mob next on rotation and took a day off work to join the raid and had your piss bottle right next to ya so you wouldnt miss out on anything. Get a life.<br>
<br>
And of course the "OMG Stasis are against the rotations, they are the best way for EVERYONE to go!" Sorry to burst your bubble , only a handfull of people think this. Rotations were good for awhile yes, and were ran very good I might add. But why do you have to prove yourself to even get on it, when other guilds that have a hard time doing it got on it with just a tell? Them being fair? Yes they were fair so someone could do X mob and not have to worry about someone coming along and doing it before them. Thats about it, but people were taking advantage of it. They would try these mobs for days and keep failing, and would never kill them. Waisting EVERYONE ELSE'S time waiting to get that mob is fair? How?<br>
<br>
And of course my favorite "Stasis is a bunch of bottom feeding nobodies!" IS that right eh? Actually, if you look at it... I believe Stasis got TIRED of BOTTOM feeding and left the rotations. Isnt that what the rotations were? Stuff that the "uber-guilds" didnt need anymore and slapped it on the rotation for everyone else to have thier left overs? Seems that way to me, but please prove me wrong. Stasis isnt bottom feeding now are they? I mean... Dain, Lord Yel, Tormax, VP, The Itraer Vius, Thought Horror Overfiend and Temple of Veeshan isnt really left overs... cause only a small amount of guilds can do them. So all you people that want Stasis to start bottom feeding like you... sorry I dont think Stasis will. Stasis has a look at the bigger picture, dont get mad because you dont.<br>
<br>
Sorry I play this game to have fun, and still do. Stasis hasnt ruined ANY of the raids I have been on.. Nagafen, Fear, PoA, Hate, Trakanon and VS. But the funny thing is.... I was invited to these raids being an officer in Stasis *gasp* And I wasnt looked at any differently, and people were not sending me tells saying "Dude do you think your guild will FCFS us?"<br>
<br>
So read that , its all fact no opinion. Dont lose sleep over it just because your "pimp tight" opinions that look nice here dont mean jack sh!t except for on this msg board and with a few feeble minds in game. Dont be mad because you are not having the fun Stasis is, or we are having more and more fun and getting more powerful as you think of ways to reply to this post. Do something about it, FCFS us and make the game even MORE fun, not just for Stasis but for yourselves as well. <br>
<br>
Yeah we all pay to play , who doesnt know that? But why force people not to have fun and make them wait.... when there is no rule saying "Sorry, you can only do X Mob when Y Guild gives you permission , cause only Y Guild can be as powerful as they are, and you arent allowed to become as powerful to do the same fun stuff Y Guild does" Get over it, change has happend and will continue to happen as long as Stasis keeps up the good work in doing what they do. Sure there might be some guilds messing it up for us by trying to be like us , but we were first and always will be. HAve a GOOD EQ and make sure to /tell all the Stasis members how much you love them for what they did for you, even though you are to ignorant to notice what it was.<br>
<br>
*POP* <br>
<br>
You might be wondering what that was, but it was the sound of Cisne's head coming out of his/her ass. <br>

<br>
That's Bubble<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> girl</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Bubble<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> woman</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, or Bubble<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bitch</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Adax.  I'll accept any of those.<br>
<br>
Stooge:  My name is Cisne.  I've been playing on Prexus since June of 1999.  I was in Griffin Claw, then Society of Shadows, and then KTF until I recently resigned due to lack of playing time at the moment.  I was very involved in championing the calendar system for quite some time.<br>
<br>
I believe in the rotations and calendars whole heartedly.  I think that they are the most equitable way to make sure that as many people as possible get the enjoyment of the high end game.  That's partly because EQ is, at this point in my life, a mere diversion.  I don't have the time (or the need anymore) to willingly spend plunked in front of a monitor trying to prove my worth by controlling more pixels and bytes of experience/loot/characters.  I guess there's some kind of flaw in me, since I'm not interested in getting all I can and @#%$ over everyone else, and that's probably partly the reason I've never been someone who always has the most awesome gear, etc.<br>
<br>
So, that's who I am.<br>
<br>
Your list of &quot;facts&quot; is full of opinions and assumptions, Stooge.  And once again, you talk about people not looking at the reasons Stasis has done what it has.  The only reason that logically fits with your actions is that Stasis wanted things, and didn't want to wait for them.  You've said as much in other posts, so please don't try to deny it here.<br>
<br>
That's all it boils down to.  It's not okay for you to wait, but it's okay to make others wait instead.  So you feel free to jump to the head of the line, an unofficial line in terms of VI's rules of the game, but something the server had in place for a long time, and tried to make as equitable as possible.  Stasis felt free to disregard what could be considered civilized behavior and act like complete boors because they felt their needs should come first over everyone else.<br>
<br>
And no, of course those people who &quot;quietly&quot; support FCFS aren't taking any flak at this point.  You should have realized your actions would make you a lightning rod for criticism, and if that's a problem for you, well, there's a saying: Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  But it's not really an issue that people are unhappy with you, is it?  Because you and Stasis now have what you want.  You destroyed the calendar and rotations, in the name of getting what you want when you want it, and damn how anyone else feels about it.<br>
<br>
I don't hate you or your guildmates, Stooge, even though I'm sure you could care less about that too.  But I am having a pretty hard time understanding how you can feel so justified in your actions, and how you can possibly see them as not fitting the labels &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;selfish&quot;.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be enough support for a return to the calendar/rotation systems at the moment, so I accept that for better or for worse, this server is FCFS at the moment.  That doesn't mean I have to like it, or that I will not speak up about not liking it.  You say your guild &quot;proves&quot; things &quot;where they count, in game&quot;.  Proves that the strong can walk all over the weak without consequence, IMO.  Proves that a few can spoil things for the many, IMO.<br>
<br>
You play a game; I see a social interaction among many people which should be subject to everything that makes us civilized in the real world.  Would you push your way to the front of a long line at a fast food restaurant to try to place your order before all the others there?  No, I'm sure you wouldn't IRL.  But in game, you feel that exact same behavior is acceptable.  We have two very different points of view with no middle ground, I'm afraid.<br>
<br>
I'll leave you with one last thought.  How many times did Nasir try for his tenth ring?  And in those tries, how many people from other guilds helped him?  How many from KTF, Unity, and others?<br>
<br>
IN MY OPINION, what Nasir and Stasis did was accept that help, willingly given, and then turn around and give the high level community of Prexus the finger.  That's one of the things I find so reprehensible about all of this.<br>
<br>
Enjoy playing the game the way you want to play it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usto0ge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StO0gE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/13/02 7:12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rotations, FCFS, Blah, Blah, Blah</span><hr size=1> Sneer is gonna kick my ass for comin back here with more responces but i cant help it =)<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 In the begining of the Trak and VS rotations nobody really liked Stasis.. we were new.. nobody knew who we were really.. the only thing people knew was that we came from the guild skyfire..<br>
  We asked many times to be put on the wonderful all mighty rotation.. and were pretty much as you said it.. given the finger..   we were told by people that we werent good enough.. we were told by people that we have yet to prove anything..  we werent &quot; aloud &quot; to attempt trakanon, a mob in this &quot;fair&quot; game,  we had everything it took to take down the same mobs everyone else was.. <br>
  We werent &quot; Aloud &quot; on the VS rotation until one day we had everyone ready after a patch to go FCFS VS.. then people negotiated with Nasir and other officers..  this was a while ago and i doubt many remember it.<br>
 At the time half the guild wanted to just go fcfs and play it out that way..  but alot of important people to the guild disagreed and we just shut up and waited patiently.<br>
  We werent &quot; Aloud &quot; on the trakanon rotation until we killed Gorenaire, Severlious, Queen of chardok ( which was very hard at the time), and Talendor...   and even after all that the official responce to us being aloud on the rotation was delayed until the last second..<br>
  We did come a long long way from there.. and things seemed to everyone that everything was ok..  but dont tell me about getting the finger..  <br>
<br>
  Yes all of this was before the rotation message board and once that was up no guild had any problem getting a trial run at whatever they wanted when they asked for it.   Yes i know you had nothing to do with anything bad towards us Cisne..  but time goes by and the rotations became something that Stasis did not feel they wanted a part of anymore.. thats as basic as i will get with reason.   Sounds selfish to everyone but so be it.<br>
<br>
  I just dont see what the big deal will be if Trakanon Venril Sathir Cazic Thule and Dain are not rotated anymore.. i have faith that things will work out.. maybe not as good as people thought the rotations were.. but people will live and its not like it is anything different because pretty much everything else is &quot;fcfs&quot; and i have seen many guilds grow to the point where they are ready for Velious mobs..  and i have a feeling that people will see how the Velious high end game is and see how it isnt so bad.<br>
<br>
This is not flame or anything to you Cisne.. you are defending your rotations like i am defending my guild no matter how dumb it might seem for me to argue with you.<br>
<br>
Btw, nice to meet you, sorry i didnt recognize your name and your guild.<br>
