May you fill thy heart with compassion and thy soul with humility, may your servant walk on the path of truth and your words and deeds be on thy heart.  May I be girded in your strength and shielded from temptation; may I serve you first in my heart and then in deeds my lord.&quot;  That's when I heard a whispering voice, barely audible say to me, &quot;stand up good and faithful servant.&quot;  I recognized the voice at once as Marr himself.  As I stood, a great light appeared before me beckoning me to follow. <BR>  <BR> My spirit began to fly, out of the Temple of Marr and over the great city of Freeport south towards the Desert of Ro.  As I looked down, my heart was grieved and a tear came to my eye as I flew over the Militia house, what potential that young knight had...  I crossed the Desert of Ro and then the Oasis on to the Southern Ro, never slowing nor wavering from our path.  As we entered the Innothule Swamp, my spirit was troubled by all the evil present in this unholy forsaken land.  We then turned southeast and can to a stop outside at a cave entrance. <BR>  <BR> Several frog-like creatures dressed in chain mail protected the cave entrance.  My heart was heavy with sadness for these creatures but I didn't know why.  Just then, a swarm of Ogres and Trolls attacked the guards and I instantly grabbed for my sword and charged into battle.  I headed for the large Ogre that was the obvious leader with a battle cry.  I swung with all my might and to my surprise my sword passed right through the vile creature.  The Ogre didn't even slow and ran right through me to the lead guard.  It is then that I remembered that I was there in spirit only and couldn't assist.  The battle was intense and as the first frog knight fell, the great light moved on into the cave.  I slowly walked into the cave with my sword still drawn as I quietly said a prayer for the fallen knights. <BR>  <BR> The light led me into the caves of Guk, down the hallway to the right.  We followed the water then down the ramp.  We traveled quickly and passed many frogs warriors.  We went into the fountain room and followed the hallway down deeper into the caves.  We came upon a bridge and took the first opening to the left, through the jail and down the right passage and then the left.  My heart was racing as I wondered what this was all about.  We passed a bar and then entered a large room with a pit with several rooms attached to it.  We quickly entered the second room to the left and came to a stop before a frog knight named the Shin Lord. <BR>  <BR> The great light began to speak again saying &quot;A long time ago I heard the cries of this knight and poured out my mercy on him.  These lands were in the middle of a battle of good and evil and this small faction of knights pleaded for assistance.  I took pity on them and forged a sword with my own hands to assist them.  This knight was given the holy sword empowered to slay undead and he used it bravely in battled.  His army suffered great losses but they were able to take this region in my name.  I was so proud of my servant and he was appointed Shin Lord over this land.  Years of peace and prosperity reigned in the land and the Shin Lord allowed the evil seed of contentment to take root in his people.  Undead frogs began to appear in the lower levels and Ogres and Trolls began to appear in the swamp.  The Shin Lord and his followers instead of attacking turned their backs and allowed the seed to sprout.  As the evil forces began to attack, they withdrew to the upper caves not wanting to suffer huge losses again.  Evil flourished without any opposition and soon it was apparent that their defenses wouldn't be able to hold any longer.  Knowing that they couldn't sustain a war on two fronts, they decided to align themselves with their undead kin in the lower levels thus allowing the sprout of evil to produce fruit. Their lack of faith has resulted in their eyes being blinded from the truth; they saved their bodies only to have their souls condemn by me!&quot; <BR>  <BR> Then the image wavered and I saw Marr standing before me with an outstretched finger pointing at me - &quot;I am giving over these knights to their evil hearts.  You are being sent to carry out my judgment against them.  You are to slay the Paladin known as the Shin Lord.  Upon his death, my judgment of truth will transform his outward appearance into the evil creature that he has become - he will be forever known as the Ghoul Lord!  Do not be deceived by impostors, the real Shin Lord wields the holy sword known as GhoulBane.  I am giving this sword to you now my good and faithful servant.  Do not forget its past and do not forget this day of judgment…&quot;  Then I opened my eyes and I was standing before the altar of Marr.  My body was covered with sweat, heart pounding and my hands and legs were trembling.  I struggled to think about something else, but a whisper of a voice in my head was slowly getting louder.  Unable to resist the voice any longer, I collapsed to my knees and began to weep uncontrollably as the voice within finally screamed out &quot;I am being sent to kill a fellow Paladin.&quot; <BR>  <BR> End of Part 1 <BR>  <BR> Humbly Sir Tolecnal du'Lac <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugladoitor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gladoitor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed Protector</span><br>  Posts: 476<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/15/02 10:29:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Gladoitor/thumbnails/Sig+pic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One Knights quest for Ghoulbane - Part 1</span><hr size=1> Man  this board  is old! <p><br>
