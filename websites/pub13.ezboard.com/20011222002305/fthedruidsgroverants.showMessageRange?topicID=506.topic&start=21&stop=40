We have the warrior who likes to act like a total jerk in every possible way.  He wouldn't get any favours from me either with a mouth like that.<br>
But on the other side we have the druid who just sits there doing nothing, inviting the warrior to get upset.  Come on, how much mana does a SoW cost?  Would it really take so much effort to mem, stand, cast, sit?  Believe me, it takes FAR less effort than going through all this arguing, and you don't make any enemies either.<br>
<br>
&quot;EQ works on a balance that everyone needs everyone else in order to work&quot;<br>
Correct, and that's why we have groups. In a group, it's our job to SoW just like it's your job to tank.<br>
But some people seem to think we owe them these services outside of a group.  What's more, if we ask for a space in your group I bet you'd refuse, claiming that you don't need a druid (because you already have a SoW that you begged off one earlier).<br>
<br>
Suppose I was on my druid asked you to take a few hits for me so I can kill a certain mob.  But stay out of the group because you would take exp. Would you agree?<br>
(I'm guessing you would say &quot;No&quot; at this point.)<br>
But it's your JOB to tank.  Tank for me NOW or I'll come to your boards and flame you.<br>
See what I mean?  This is no different to what you're saying. <p>-- <br>

In a COMBAT situation IT IS your job to taunt. In a NON COMBAT situation it IS NOT a Druid or Shamans OBLIGATION to sow/buff/port ANYONE if they are otherwise engaged with another activity. Granted, in that same COMBAT situation where is IS your job to taunt, I believe it IS the Shaman/Druids job to SoW (if permitted in the zone), buff, and/or snare.<br>

That is INCREDIBLE Maximus. As a Shaman you can't tell me that you jump and run to everyone that says "buff me!" As a rule it seems that those who don't say "please", also don't say "thank you", and I'm not in the habit of allowing myself to be used and/or taken for granted, in game or in real life. You can be someones buff monkey/bitch if you want, but I won't.<br>
<br>
Again, in a COMBAT situation my mana flows freely to buff/heal/sow those WHEN IT IS my job. In NON COMBAT situations, I do so at my discretion, and at MY pleasure. When I buff someone in a NON COMBAT situation I'm DOING THEM A FAVOR. Common courtesy isn't too much to ask, is it? If you think it is, then GET OVER HERE AND SHINE MY SHOES SON! Your not busy right now, so DO IT!<br>

<br>
First off, this now belongs in the rants. Ziffy, you clearly did NOT read Boofy/doofy/zoofy's comments. He HAS a high level druid, so he DOES also play a druid. You also made a load of spelling mistakes...and your method of arguing leaves a LOT to be desired. Please stop flaming like that, its pointless and far more productive to bring your point accross with a well thought out argument.<br>
<br>
Ok, secondly, Boofy/Doofy/etc, it *is* common courtesy to just say please wit any request of any kind. If a GM accidentally killed me...I'd still say, could you res me please you got me killed. Thats just being polite. Sometimes playing a druid makes you understand how annoying it is to always get sow/gg requests and so we are mroe polite. Other times we feel that they are a druid and they can sow one of my alts because one day I might sow their alts. I never have felt like the latter, but i guess some people can.  After reading what you stated happened, that you asked him, he said one sec...ou say thanks, then he says can't its not memmed and GG's...well, I can understand your annoyance, the thing is *shrug* plenty other druids in the sea, let the guy go, don't bother taking it to tells it just breeds resentment. Mark him on your black list or whatever, but just ignore the guy (also don't you have a cleric? Pretty sure I'd prefer a druid angry at me that to be a druid with an angry cleric).<br>
<br>
As for the StunrayX whatever your name is...first thing I noticed in your post was you trying to show off about having a paw at a low level *shrug* I know it may not be how you meant it, thats just how it came accross to me. Then I started to identify with what you went through and, to be honest, if I was in a bad mood, I'd have done exactly what you did. If I were in a good mood I would have sow'd him and then said something about his lack of response. I play an ench mainly now...I recently came accross a newbie group and I clarity and speed stick them all. Only ONE of them said thanks...when he replied I told him &quot;At least one of you guys has manners, the others never even responded&quot;. *shrug*.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, Doofy..its always polite to say please when asking for something. Some people think saying thank you after is enough...but unfortunately this often means you never say thank you because the persn takes it as an insult that you did not say please.<br>
<br>
RaygunXthingybloke, You acted as most people would I think, but the flames on this thread afterwards (by both, not just you) are kinda lame. Just let the matetr drop..if you like, don't speak in game again..but to drag this out publically is kinda crappy for both of ya as some people will agree with one side, so you both will get negative feelings associated with your names.<br>

No &quot;please&quot; , so the guy is a rude @#%$ and can go to hell? The guy was standing RIGHT THERE. If someone asks me for a sow and is standing in front of me I sow them. As I said before, saying please is nice, but saying you won't sow someone for not saying please is pathetic. There is another word here you people need to learn. Compassion. Try helping someone without requiring them to stroke your ego or fill your pockets for a change. I wonder how many of you who think a &quot;please&quot; is a requirement will overlook that rule if the person says &quot; Can I get a sow for 5pp&quot;? Kinda funny how often people's rules change when monies are involved.<br>
<br>
To anyone here that has said &quot;please&quot; every time they have ever asked for anything in both real and virtual life, WELL DONE!! I congratulate you on being the epitome of politeness. <br>

i know boofy contradicted that in his/her post, and in that one maybe the druid 'should' have cast it, but it is totally his right to refuse if he has seen behaviour of boofy's in the past or something which he doesnt like, whatever reason he would refuse, boofy should have just left it at that since as i said, it isnt a druids job to sow all of noraths newbies.<br>

I personally try to help people out whenever possible. Other people might have differing opinions on how to behave toward people. <br>
<br>
If Boofy was under the impression that the guy was going to sow him, then the guy gated, that could very easily cause some frustration. According to the gater, he was already gating, according to Boofy, he sat there for a couple minutes after being asked for a Sow. I wasn't there, so I have no idea which scenario is true. Probably a little bit of both scenarios. I can easily understand some ill feelings by Boofy afterwards, and I think he handled it poorly. <br>
<br>
The reason for my posts were regarding multiple people saying he was rude by saying &quot;can I get a sow&quot; without saying please. The only rudeness he exhibited occurred AFTER the person had gated. I think many people that posted here calling him rude for not saying please were taking his post-gate tells into consideration in the pre-gate converstaion. I still fail to see how &quot;Can I get a sow&quot; can be construed in any way rude. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ps. It SHOULD be a druids job to sow all of Norrath. A druid named Sowemall. Their entire game identity should be to travel the lands of norrath with a list of all players, casting sow on all the little boys and girls and bestowing Sowemall's greatness upon them all. Day and night, rain and shine, brave Sowemall shall sally forth untill one day, all Norrathians have been made fleet of foot. Then Sowenall shall give way unto his little sister, Gatedemall to continue on the family tradition!!<br>

How about you leave how to play my character, to me? You have NO right to tell me ANYTHING about how to play.<br>
<br>
I did NOT have SoW memorized, it was a bad day for me, and I was about as nervous as a wreck trying to get all my Senior Grades up (Too much playing eq.. bring grades down.. bah). And so, when someone who I dont even know comes up and doesnt have the courtesy to say please, EXCUSE ME if I dont feel I am obligated to Mem SoW, just for him, and then Re-Mem my other spell..<br>
<br>
Would it have taken long? NO. But is it my job to Do it? NO. And if I am having a bad day, and dont feel like SoWing someone, do I have to? NO!<br>
<br>
Mind your own Buissness Max, just because you are level 60 gives you no right at all to tell me how to play my role.<br>
<br>
Most people I DO SOW, and keep SoW mem'ed JUST for the SOLE reason of SoWing Them, I solo the Giants in FM some, otherwise if I&quot;m in a group, sure, then I have SoW memmed for them, naturally. But if I&quot;m soloing, half the time I keep SoW memmed just to SoW the passerbye's who ask for it. And most of the time, I DO SoW them..<br>
<br>
Why? Because I AM a nice guy. But there are certin days when we dont feel like doing things. <br>
<br>
And Maxipus.. err.. Whatever your name is (You cant remember mine so why should I remember yours) again, mind your buissness please. Thank you.<br>

To me, personally, Can I get a sow is rude, because I was brought up in a repressive Southern household where MAY I get a (insert thing here) was the rule of the day. It doesn't mean I won't sow if I'm not busy, but if you run off without a even a thx afterward-no sow for joo anymore.<br>
<br>
People who say please get it free, even if they say plz (which personally sets my teeth on edge) <br>
<br>
I do not consider common politeness to be too much trouble for someone asking me a FAVOR. If you don't want to jump through the please and thank you hoop play a druid or ask someone else.<br>
<br>
All these rules are in abeyance if I'm busy. I say No. Excuses give people a wormhole to guilt you into doing something. (also a trick we Southerners learn at birth)<br>

I wasn't trying to tell you how to play your class. I stated that if you sat there for two minutes, as Boofy said you did, thats pretty pathetic( thats called an opinion). I also stated people have the right to play their character any way they want. You have every right to be in too much of a hurry to sow someone when its holding up your lucrative gating enterprise.  <br>

As far as your grades go, I hope you get your gameplay/ vs school worked out. I know a few people who let EQ become too important to them, ruined marriages, lost jobs, college failing grades etc...<br>
No game is worth destroying your real life over.<br>

Ps. Maxipus? Is that some inane attempt at an insult? :D<br>

Pps. &quot;May I&quot; is a more &quot;proper&quot; way of saying &quot;can I&quot;. The reason you feel it is more polite is the fact it is proper english rather than improper grammer. Either way, if someone feels &quot;can I get a sow&quot; would require a please to be responded to, then &quot;may I have a sow&quot; would also require a please. I personally don't feel either statement would require a &quot;please&quot; to be responded too. This is an informal virtual world we are talking about. There are people who spam zones with profanity and exhibit all forms of rude behavior. In my opinion, someone who REQUIRES a please before they help someone in this setting is someone who is looking to get their ego stroked rather then someone worried about politeness. What is more impolite, not saying please, or refusing to help someone because they didn't say please?<br>
<br>
Ppss. Just reread the previous post. &quot;May I get&quot; is no more polite or proper then &quot;can I get&quot;. If you want to use proper grammer it is &quot;May I have &lt;insert item here&gt;&quot; <p><b><font size=3.5>Maximus Judicar</b></font><br>Level 60 Shaman of the Tribunal<br><i><font color=blue><p align=center><font size=3.2>~We care not for good nor evil.

Usually I'll stick em on ignore for an hour or 2 just in case they feel the need to tell me what a @#%$ I am.<br>

Its a win-win situation!! They may hate me for a few minutes but because I havent helped inflame the situation they'll forget about me...and it means that I wont have to stand up, cast sow and sit down again!<br>

And to that warrior/druid guy (sorry, can't remember your name). You should group with my regular group. We have a cleric who hates mana inefficient fighting. Our pally decided to try out a Messenger of the Queen and the ranger started using his Blackjack. The cleric let the pally die after asking her not to wield it...the ranger swapped out the Blackjack in less than a second ;)<br>
<br>
Doubt our cleric would be impressed you letting a non tank take your hits :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unymue262626.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nymue262626</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/2/01 6:07:56 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=C:\Vicki's Files\nymue2.jpg></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol....</span><hr size=1> Just thought I'd insert my 2cp on Maximus's point ...<br>

**saying please is nice, but saying you won't sow someone for not saying please is pathetic. There is another word here you people need to learn. Compassion. **<br>
<br>
The problem with *this* is, in my experience 75% of the people who ask for SoW from me DO NOT NEED IT to play the game.  SoW is great, yeah, whee.  You don't need it to play the game, damnit, it just saves you time.  Now, if someone died in NK without binding and comes up to me at the WC druid ring and asks for a SoW or port to help get him to his body, I take it into account that he's upset (if he's less than polite), and yes, he could probably use a SoW.  The warrior who *wants* a SoW to get to the awesome group in Oasis that's made up of his buddies?  If he says please and respects me, okie doke.  If not, naw.  I have alts too, but I never ask for SoW.  Period.  Because I can play just fine without it.  And if I did, I would *definitely* say please, because I know what it's like to feel like a piece of crap and someone's SoW biyatch.<br>

<br>
I have been a druid almost since this game was started.  I am not sure if this problem of *begging* and *whinning* is as rampant on other servers as it is on Mith Marr - but on Mith Marr it is pretty horrible.<br>
<br>
I *HATE* newbie zones - or any large gathering zones for that matter - like West Commons or Greater Fay.  Why do I hate those zones? Simple... here is a sample of what happened to me in GFay a couple months ago:<br>
<br>
You have entered Greater Faydark<br>
Newbie1 tells you, &quot;can you GG me to NK?&quot;<br>
You beging casting a spell.<br>
You feel the spirit of the wolf enter you.<br>
Newbie2 tells you, &quot;Can you buff me please?&quot;<br>
You tell newbie1, &quot;Sorry hun, I just got here!&quot;<br>
Newbie3 tells you, &quot;Can you bind me at the ork lift - PLEASE!!&quot;<br>
You tell newbie2, &quot;Sorry hun, I can't right now&quot;<br>
Newbie4 waves at you.<br>
newbie4 says, &quot;Can I have SOW?&quot;<br>
You begin casting a spell<br>
Newbie5 tells you, &quot;Do you have anything to spare for a yound druid friend?&quot;<br>
Newbie3 tells you, &quot;Are you there?&quot;<br>
Newbie6 tells you, &quot;Hi there.&quot;<br>
<br>
I mean, seriously, WTF??? When this game first started I remember how reluctant people would be to ask for stuff.  Now they see a high level player and they automatically assume it is your responsibility - no - your duty - to do something for them.  Where did this pathetic lazyness come from??  The worst part - is that they don't even wait for you to zone - the tells start hitting you immediately =(<br>
<br>
I had another one the other day:<br>
<br>
Player1 tells you, &quot;Can you GG me?&quot;<br>
You tell Player1, &quot;Sorry, I can't right now.&quot;<br>
Player1 tells you, &quot;Why not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Why not? Why not? When the hell did it become anyone else's business my reasons for not taking someone's lazy ass accross the continent? The other ones that piss me off are the ones that send you a tell with a plain old &quot;Hello&quot; - you look at the name, it's no one you know - you know they are getting ready to beg - why not save you the typing and just ask for what they want outright? Lately, when I get those &quot;Hello!&quot; tells, they just ignored...<br>
<br>
Lately, I have used an AFK message to try to minimize the number of responses I have to send out, here is what happened about 2 weeks ago:<br>
<br>
Dude1 tells you, &quot;Can you GG me?&quot;<br>
You tell Dude1, &quot;Sorry, I am AFK right now - I am not currently gating, buffing, giving anything away, powerleveling, binding - Sorry!&quot;<br>
Dude1 tells you, &quot;So - can you GG Me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Grrrr! So now people can't read either =( I seriously don't mind helping people if I have nothing to do.  I never charge for gates, regardless of player level, an I don't mind un-memming my spells to buff some newbie.  However, I am NOT going to drop what I am doing to do these things.  Someone said earlier in this thread that as a druid it is my &quot;responsibility?&quot; - Uhm...all I can say is what a crock! We play this game for fun - NOTHING in this game is my responsibility.  Hell, a newbie could be standing in front of me, about to die, and me - having full mana - could heal him.  Do I generally do that? Yes.  Do I do it because it's my responsibility? No.  I do it cause I am not a b****! (most of the time, hehe)<br>
<br>
I am just so fed up with people that think that we owe them something.  I have several lower level characters that I play - rogue, Bard, SK, Enchanter, Necro.  I always take the boat - why? Because I know what a royal pain in the ass it is to get bugged every 5 minutes with people asking/whining about something.  If there is a druid trying to make some money and announces that he/she is gating, then I will pay for my gate - no biggie - but I don't go around begging - that's just sad...<br>
<br>
I worked hard for my level - for my cash.  Hell I wore leather armor until level 28 or so - and still I survived! I didn't die a horrible death or stopped playing the game because I didn't get uber buffs or uber gear.  People just need to quit their begging and whining, STFU and get what they want themselves.  <br>
<br>
And if you harrass me for a gate, here is what you will get:<br>
<br>
&quot;You want a ride? Take the dammed boat, k thx!&quot;<br>

can't ever EVER pass up a good debate. Debating are what makes the mind and brains stronger! just a little future info =P<br>
<br>
Ok now, on topic. <br>
<br>
Opening up, I agree with the poster previous to BobJiz, I too was raised in the school of hard knocks, but I think I had it a little tad bit harder! =P I was raised with a Warrior in the banded hunt, the blacksmithing era, where my warrior was in leather until level 20 (warrior newb crap is Ringmail, I had LEATHER) ok, I remember trying to run to a guild meeting and I was late, so I used my Druid as well (I played them both) I found out Druids get group gate in the future and I was gonna make sure no one had this problem again.<br>
<br>
Now in my opinion Druids are the most diverse class in Norrath, we have the ability to play any role as well as provide some of the Wisdom fortunate classes some &quot;services&quot; notice it's quoted, which means we aren't obligated to do it, because it's a service.<br>
<br>
As far as the SoW issue, and how to ask.<br>
In some ways, I agree with &quot;Maxipus&quot; lol, but just because please isn't said, doesn't mean that they don't have to get SoWed.....NOTE: That comment alone is TRUE on it's own, minus any factions (bad day, etc etc)<br>
<br>
NOTE: Please or roleplaying is not considered kissing ass, it's considered being polite, and you find out that a couple of simple words can help you out. I play alts, sometimes I get a little lazy yes, I'll ask for a gate somewhere, if I don't get it, tough sh*t, I'll run, but when I ask, since I know it's a favor and how I would react being a Druid as well<br>
<br>
Alt tells Druid: Hey, what's up, this is Asaph, was just wondering if you have time for a gate, if ya busy, it's coo!<br>
<br>
I'm speaking on the Druid's level, I'm not begging, and if he says no...tough sh*t, I'll run.<br>
<br>
I am commonly nice, I sometimes go outta my way for people I don't know, I've built a good rep on my server doing things like that. but on the occasion, don't beat around the bush whenever someone asks you something, that's how confrontations get started, another ex.<br>
<br>
SoW's are naturally manaless, above level 50, casting SoW, you barely see any bar movement, if you have it memmed, so be it, cast it, be nice, cancel your gate for 2 secs, make some people happy, unless they act otherwise. I know whenever I see someone I don't know, run up to me, and wave, that's usually a symbol that they want SoW, it's been a habit to where i'll just stand up and cast it, and they have SoW before their finished typing &quot;Can I get a SoW&quot; all I get is the thanks, they run off, so be it, I'm still playing the game, he still plays the game....in RL, you still eat, sleep and sh*t, move on, act as if you have a life, don't make a big deal out of this.<br>
<br>
Ok, I need to cut myself off here, it's getting too long, I know I hate to read long posts if they exceed essay length. still gots more to say, will say it if this one gets any reaction. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.illuminati-sancti.org/images/icons/Druid.gif"><BR>

<br>
I did a Naggy raid yesterday.  I alone picked up about 1/2 the raid from all over the EQ world, from Iceclad to Tox to Dread and brought them to Lava for Naggy.  Along the way, I got 11 non-raid tells from other players sitting at druid rings looking for ports.  I ported each and every one of them where they needed to go, including one guy (Wonk) and his buddy (Pdiddy), after buffing them to hell so they wouldn't die (Wonk fell and died the first time I ported him).<br>
<br>
After I was done, 9 out of the 11 people that I ported wanted to donate to me for being so nice to them.  I simply told them: Pay it Forward.<br>
<br>
Now, if you've ever seen that movie, you know what I mean.  Pay it forward means don't pay me back for what I did for you, but do something for some other people.  There are so many assholes in EQ (ex: Stungun or whatever your name is) that telling someone to Pay it Forward might just make everyone's EQ experience a little bit better.  I imagine that 5 out of those 9 just might do something nice for someone else because I made their day for them.  They might flip a few coins to a beginner, or heal a guy who needs it, or SoW someone while they are waiting for their friends to show up at the gate to North Freeport.<br>
<br>
Whatever the case, I just hope I made a few people happy out there, and maybe they will continue the trend.  <br>
<br>
Good Day<br>
