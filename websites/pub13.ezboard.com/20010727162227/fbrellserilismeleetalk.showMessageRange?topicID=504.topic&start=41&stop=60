<br>
1.  / lfg<br>
2.  your FOLLOW button serves a duel purpose of INVITE<br>
3.  /t cleric/enchanter/shaman_00 got a full group?<br>
<br>
If I go to Seb, I can shout out LFG for long periods of time too.  I seldom get replies.  Instead I do a / lfg and invite people that are there, and those that arrive.  No offense to them, but druids are a dime a dozen in seb.  That's heal, snare, and evac all rolled into one package.  You don't need a full group either for Seb.  At level 58 you can solo pull lots of jins and boks, and all dars and zols and kors.  Find a decent partner, or make a trio and do the zone in/zone out/jail/path to disco.  Yesterday when you saw me and Leeho after his mishap in the water, we were hunting as just a pair, and were on our way to holding the jail.<br>
<br>
Take control of your own grouping.  Don't leave it up to others.<br>

<br>
This topic get's hashed out over and over again on Paladins of Norrath.  The latest incarnation worth perusing is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=10507.topic">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
When Velious first came out, all the talk was that we were completely useless at 55+, but since then there has been a slight improvement in the general mood of the highest level players.  Essentially, for the big boss mobs, the feeling is we are somewhat useful if we concentrate on damage while avoiding aggro.  No longer tanking, our sole purpose is to hang tight on the really long battles, slowly chipping away on the mob without needing high maintenance from the clerics.  The AC gear we collected fades in favor of HP gear for surviving repeated AOEs.  (Many paladins consider our Skyshrine armor superior to our Kael armor due the big HP and STA boots on it.)  Basically, we become self healing DoTs.., take a licking and keep on ticking.  Some have even argued that on the truly long battles vs. the highest hit point bosses that mediocre damage on a non-warrior tank is advantageous.  /shrug<br>
<br>
The curent mood that I see in the high-level paladin community is the we're borderline at best: certainly better off than, say wizards, who have clearly gotten the shaft, but still riding in the back of the bus. <p><font size=3 color="#999966"

<br>
Have you ever tried playing the slower for the group?<br>
I constantly see you wielding bigass slow weapons with huge delays.<br>
Get yourself a DW bracer, and chain stuns off of it.<br>
That cast time of 6 seconds soaks up the huge delay of your weapon.<br>
The stun lasts 3 seconds.<br>
The stun takes 6 seconds to cast.<br>
The average unhasted level 45 mob swings about once every 3 seconds.<br>
That's a 50% slow on the mobs if you get the timing down.<br>
That's a 50% slow that keeps casters from casting anything under 3 seconds in cast time.<br>
True, your damage output will go to hell, but then again, a paladin is not a primary damage dealing class.  You guys deal *some* damage, while contributing heavily to damage prevention and somewhat to healing and HP and AC buffing.<br>
<br>
I think your problem is stemming from some class envy.<br>
Make the realization that you will never be the best healer, damage dealer, nuker, buffer, or slower.  You are a defensive tank with utility spells.  You can change your role within your spell and equipment choices, but it sounds like you want to change your role far beyond. <p>=============================

<br>
Zorlov, the reason I was &quot;bitchy&quot; to you was because I was in one bad mood that night. I had fallen asleep in Dragon Necropolis, and died, and woke up hours later - long enough to have my rez timer expire. I had to go back there and get my body summoned, so yeah, excuse me for calling you an idiot because I had to take a xp death at level 58. Which meant I lost it and was a half bub away again.<br>
<br>
And no, I don't treat people like crap, I only treat people like crap if I've been offended, insulted, or sniped at. I'm a nice person, until you prove yourself an idiot/jerk/@#%$ and deserve what I say. I do make mistakes however, and as such, most of those come after incidents such as the Dragon Necropolis incident. So enough said about that.<br>

We can't cast anything.  Can't heal ourselves (oh Bind Wound chuckle).  Only class I think that really can't solo unless you want to sit and take 15-20 minutes to heal (yea yea, there are Fungi Tunics now, well not everyone can get one for their uber twinks).  All we do is act as a punching bag.  We are 100% dependent on our fellow groupies.  <br>
<br>
But, I love being a warrior.  Because when the @#%$ hits the fan and at the end you look around, it's usually the Warriors left standing.  Why, becuase the cleric in his last breath of life hit you with that CHeal.  Or the Paladin hit his LoH on you.  It's becuase everyone in the group gave it all they had and played their rolls.  <br>
<br>
Doesn't matter what class you are, race, equipment, how fast you level.  It comes down to you standing side by side with your buddies and when hell is raining down upon you somehow your lil band of adventurers prevail.  Every class has value, comes down to how the person behind the keyboard perceives their own personal value. <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzyphbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zyph Brell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tastes Like Chicken!</span><br>  Posts: 611<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/22/01 2:29:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins are useless</span><hr size=1> To get back on topic 4 people come to mind when people say the paladin class is useless.<br>

I play a 57 enchanter and have played this game damn near since beta.  Not as cy but as other characters.  These 4 stick in my mind of the &quot;best&quot; paladins I have ever grouped with.<br>

Everyone can play a class.. Only a handful can play it to its max potential with a twist.  These 4 do that.  Ya there maybe more I've grouped with over my gaming career, but they don't live up in my standards.<br>

They don't tank as good as a warrior, but they tank very well and are more versatile for those imperfect groups (Monk, Paladin, Enchanter group was a lot of fun tearing up Karnors).  With a good weapon their damage output over time is still better than a (non AEing) wizard.  All the Paladins I've grouped with for a considerable amount of time have been very good players too, so that helps (Serecherd, Bronto, Thorondar, Rykilth).<br>
<br>
They're certainly not useless.<br>

<br>
period<br>
<br>
if thats what you believe, you should definitely change class, thats what I did at level 55 with Kayd.<br>
<br>
Honnestly, it did me wonders.<br>
<br>
Play what you want to play and can enjoy.<br>
<br>
Warriors are not that much better then paladin, I just feel more comfortable being one, then I ever was being a paladin.<br>
<br>
for every bad arguments against paladin, there will be a good side, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
When your depressed about being a 58 paladin in full valorium with ND, go to a fear raid, and see those dudes working their ass off to get their first piece, and using sub par weapons, simply enjoying the adventure.<br>
<br>
Its not about what you have, or what you are, but what you do, and how you do it.<br>

<br>
Paladins, Rangers, and Shadowknights are all 'screwed' by the system because we are hybrids.  We lose the specialization capabilities of the 'pure' classes in exchange for more utility.  If you (not Fenye specifically; anyone playing a hybrid) didn't realize that going into being a hybrid, you deluded yourself.<br>
<br>
The biggest single problem is that everyone believes that ALL groups, without question, no matter where you go in Everquest, period, MUST contain an enchanter, a cleric, and a warrior (or at the absolute worst, two of the three).<br>
<br>
If people would get creative, and try some new things... they'd realize you generally may only need one of the three, and often times you can get by with none of them.  I freely admit that life is easier with all three, but they are not REQUIRED.<br>
<br>
Can you kill Trakanon without them?  Probably not.  Can you run all over, say, Howling Stones-- except, maybe, the east wing?  Yes (heck, I've done it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  You definately have to get creative on crowd control and downtime healing, but Paladins are pretty decent at both of those.  You might have to be a bit more selective on where you go, based on who you can get together... but still... it's not that bad.<br>
<br>
As for larger raids... the concept of a low-agro, self-healing DoT is definately true.  I've found that with archery I can keep up some good damage on the more 'epic' mobs and control my agro much better.  I'm sure the typical high damage/high delay Paladin weapons are good for the same thing... staying alive and contributing damage over the long term, which is better than a quick burst of damage and then waiting for a rez.<br>
<br>
If you feel that strongly about the perception of the Paladin class, or have questions or ideas about Paladin stuff... maybe start a new thread where people can talk and share constructive ideas about Paladins, their spells and abilities, and neat ways to use them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So I can't really give any advice about them that would be able to stand next to the Paladins that have posted here. All I can say is that they are a hybrid class.  They tank a bit, they heal a bit, they buff a bit, but they don't do anything with exacting precision as their &quot;parent&quot; classes.<br>
<br>
(A: Cons of Being a Warrior)<br>
You know, I can seriously bitch about being a Warrior.  We're helpless punching bags whose worth is measured in how much crap we can have beaten out of us.  We have no skills of our own, no spells, and we must be escorted about and cared for (ironically enough) as if we were fragile as glass.  We can't solo worth a damn, so if my friends aren't on, I'm left to the mercy of a_random_group_of_morons00 or I can log off.  And no, sitting on my ass to heal up the 2k health I just spent on a low blue con (if I'm that lucky, haha) does NOT count as soloing.  Besides, the way they designed many mobs, you are seriously outclassed even if the mob is a freakin' green con.  It's all just about getting a BP with a little more AC or a weapon that has better damage/delay or a proc.  Nothing changes for Warriors, especially at high levels.<br>
<br>
(B: Pros of Being a Warrior)<br>
I love being a Warrior.  We're the infantry men.  We're the grunts in the field, heeding the call to storm the trenches again and again, living for another charge or meeting death with a mad grin on our faces.  I feel like I am doing as much as any other group member to make the collective effort a success.  I'm the one going toe to toe with each mob and throwing myself at it, slashing, crushing, piercing, kicking, bashing, dodging, parrying, riposting, disarming, and taunting.  It's like drawing my Lamentation, making a line in the sand, and saying, &quot;Just you and me, you punkass monster!!!!  I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DARE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you to take me down!!!!&quot;  And when the enemies seem innumerable and they are clawing the group to pieces, I am there, making every last drop of health work as hard as it can. I engage one of the advanced Warrior disciplines, flying into a whirling maelstrom of death as my blades slice with supernatural precision...<br>
<br>
Which description sounds more fun?  Same class, but it's all in how you look at it.  Play the class you have fun with.  Learn to work around any challenges you find, and focus on your strengths.  It seems there's a large amount of Paladins who have found contentment with their class.  Those that haven't, switched classes and found something they could enjoy better.<br>
<br>
It's really not the class.  It's the person behind it.  And the person behind it can either write paragraph (A) or (B).<br>
