Dels is a player like all others of you posting on this thread... She has the same right to expose her opionion on this board as you have...<br>
<br>
And what del's is saying is true...<br>
<br>
Okie lets say i diden큧 have my Epic yet...  lets say i was still trying to get Ragefire...  Lets say i clear FG's without reserving them, this makes me greedy??  Hmmm nah i don큧 think so, i wanted to acomplish something that i started nothing more nothing less...<br>
<br>
If you call me greedy for taking the firegiants w/o Reservating them i call you greedy for whining about it!  <br>
<br>
But anyway thats not even the point...  The point is that at the time i posted this, there was 4/5 reservations for FG/Rage!<br>
<br>
And that was something that i found kinda funny but also anoying.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow i think we cleared the subject. Lets not turn this into a rant/Flame towards me or the MoD's. <br>

You're about to start parking your car, and someone in a hurry with a smaller car manages to slip in before you because it's much easier for him.<br>

When you tell him &quot;mmh sorry but i was parking here..&quot; he just tells you &quot;oh sorry i didnt know&quot; then walks away.<br>

I dont care who posts here but if you do atleast keep it to the subject and dont bring other things into it ... <br>
<br>
this thread is about fire giants not anything to do with bashing mods ... I read the whole thread again up to dels post and for some reason he said people should respect mods ... well we do but I dont see why you needed to bring that up unless you wanted to derail the thread.<br>
<br>
<br>
if you read my post you will see I would cheer you on if you kill fg's before someones scheduled raids IF you get rage fire but I would be pretty upset if you kill all the fire giants and dont kill rage fire or nagafen.<br>
<br>
that is all I am saying<br>
<br>
<br>
and yes I think it is greed if people kill fire giants and ruin someones scheduled raid then say it is because we wanted to know if rage was up or not .... I still think you can track rage with a ranger without killing any fire giants... until I am proving wrong I will still believe that. just to elaborate on this ... what would make a cleric trounce someones reservation ... because they want to establish a camp before another cleric comes in with their raid crew and steals it away from them.... so who needs respect? I would say the clerics need to respect each other a little more ....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have been playing on brell since it opened please dont say I didnt put my time in , I have been posting or reading this message board one way or another since erisun I think it was ran the board .... <br>
<br>
<br>
I dont think it is the fire giant reservation that is stopping anything <br>
<br>
I think it is something that needs to be worked out with the clerics.<br>

<br>
Keeping FGs reserveable have the same effect as the raid intention forum had in the old days. Ragefire isnt reservable but people use the FGs to try and block others from getting to it. <br>
<br>
Mantose might think that all others dont care if someone else get ragefire and FGs when ragefire is up. But that is about as far from the actual facts as anything can be.<br>
<br>
Like the raid intention forum was changed cause people was abusing it, the same should happen to the FG reservation. Cause its being abused in the same way.<br>
<br>
Mantose I bet you almost 100% that if you shedule a FG raid for a certain day and contact the cleric camping Ragefire he will be able to tell you when the FGs was last killed and when they pop again. That might mean you cant put a 100% accurate time on your FG raid, but I can almost assure you that the cleric will be more than happy if you will clear the respawn for him when it happens so he can continue his camp.<br>

If only valid Raid Practice reservations were made and not a bunch of BS reservations of Clerics wanting to reserve Rage and hiding behind FG's to do it, then there would only be two or three FG raids a week. Rest of the time would be open season on Rage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Let me tell you a funny story. Today (or yesterday, now) I was on the A-S FG Raid with Skippin and Nico. I lost the roll on a dandy piece of neckwear...better AC than I currently have and great Wis bonus for those times I am called to play Cleric. I declined a roll on the Mithril Arms because my Valorium is better. Anyway, we are having a nice raid with a great bunch of people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Rage is not up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Before we even clear the Bridge, three people are arguing over who has dibbs on Rage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 Now here is the funny part. One is a Ranger, another is a Monk FD'd in the lair, the third is a Mage that followed us in. At least two of the three clerics they were supposed to be camping Rage for were not online. None of the combatants had any forces at all gathered to take out Rage. The Monk was saying since he was FD'd for 18hrs he should have dibbs. The Ranger was saying that since neither the monk or the mage had their cleric on-line they could not call a camp. Someone else said that you had to reserve FG's and do a raid to reserve Rage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Being the grumpy Dwarf I am, I had to speak up after wiping the tears of laughter from my eyes. I said that FG's are reservable but Ragefire is not. Ragefire is FCFS and who ever is able to get the forces togather and get to Ragefire first gets him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I still say that Clerics have to get a lesson in Humility and Piety and 1) Stop trying to reserve Rage by abusing the FG reservations and 2) Work with legitamate FG's raiders to follow them in to get Ragefire. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If Clerics will do these two things then FG's will be open more often than not and people will regain respect for a class that is losing it because of the childish attitude they are displaying with this one spawn. But maybe that is the problem, there are not enough adults and too many children playing on this server for people to have reasonable discussions on how to work around each other so everyone comes out good. Instead we have school children screaming &quot;MINE!&quot; like I heard today.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, the only way to teach the children that are abusing the reservations is to ignore the 4 or 5 reservations every week that are really for Ragefire and go get him when he spawns. But, please respect the honest FG hunters like my friends in A-S.<br>

<br>
One of our guild clerics camped the lair for approx. 22 hours for Ragefire.  He spawned.  After checking the board, we noticed that another cleric had reserved FG's at that time, so we couldn't go in and kill Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Our only solution to this, is to schedule Fire Giant raids.<br>
<br>
Note:  The only thing we need is Ragefire.  NOTHING from the Firegiants interests us, but because of the current system, we have to schedule them to get to Ragefire. <p><font color=red>--------------------------------</font><br>

<br>
If that were the case, or hell if Ragefire was actually up more than two minutes after spawning, the folks arguing FG reservations being a restriction on a bottleneck would have a point.<br>
<br>
But, he's not... and so they don't.<br>
<br>
Now read over Krungles last post and think carefully.  Don't think about those darned low levels doing a three hour fire giant raid (those greedy bastards, three hours and then just leaving the place... all while Ragefire wasn't even up, what the hell were they thinking)... no, think about the other part...<br>
<br>
The monk who'd been feigning there for 18 hours.  The Paladin trying for a spot on the Ragefire camp.  The mage following us in for a spot in the Ragefire line.  The guild of higherlevel folks led by one of the more respected Paladins on the server following our raid a few hours later (hint, he posted just before me).  That's at least four clerics (or more) represented waiting for one spawn that did, or did not happen.<br>
<br>
That's not counting the tells I received pre-raid asking if we were going in for Ragefire (we weren't, aren't, and won't do it).  All told, I ran a greedy raid over a three hour window for a group of level 40's during a time when Ragefire wasn't up, while AT LEAST four people were already in line for Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Now think, just for a moment...<br>
<br>
Even if Fire Giants were out of the equation, would that have changed the situation?  Answe: NO.  Remember, that monk was there for 18 hours.  Eighteen hours... That's at least two full fire giant respawns (which btw, weren't reserved and probably did not get used) while he was waiting on Ragefire...<br>
<br>
I know its very easy to think that if Fire Giants were just removed from the reservation then somehow YOU would be at the front of the line.  I know its easy to assume that its just those damned greedy people reserving Fire Giants keeping YOU from your hard earned epic.<br>
<br>
However, facts don't weigh that out.<br>
<br>
I've ran four Fire Giant raids recently.  One was walked on.  Not a single one of those raids saw a Ragefire spawn (including the people that walked over our raid, they didn't get a Rage spawn either).  So, exactly how many high level clerics has my reservations kept from attaining their epic.<br>
<br>
Answer: ZERO<br>
<br>
That's right, zero.  Not a single one.  Why? Well... Ragefire wasn't up.  No Ragefire, no Cleric Epic.  No Ragefire, no one was harmed in that raid.  OTOH, I've actually taken a lot of people that have never raided, ran them through some very enjoyable raids, gained an item or two for some of them, and taught them a lot about what an organized raid SHOULD be like.  Given that the entire server isn't level 55+, I'd say I've actually done something for the server.  Given that I've not made a single item, nor pp, nor much xp on these raids, I'd venture that my own personal gains have not been the reason I've done them.  Certain martyr wannabe's can count that as their suck commentary.<br>
<br>
So, I'm asking.  How would removing Fire Giant reservations change things one iota?  That monk will still be there 18 hours.  THose forty five Cleric alts in SolB will still be there.  Ragefire is the bottleneck, NOT the fire giants.  At worst the few folks reserving FG's like Watchers did (and Europa Tribes has done) will only have a small chance of their raid actually GETTING either Ragefire or even the right to camp ragefire since in all likelihood Ragefire will ALREADY be camped on their arrival.<br>
<br>
As indicated, I've run four Fire Giant raids in the last two months.  The longest (the first) ran 3.5 hours, the shortest (the last) ran 2 hours.  All told I've 'abused' 11 hours of Sol B in eight weeks without a single Ragefire spawn.  I'd be impressed if someone could actually demonstrate how that is greedy.  Honestly demonstrate it please?<br>
<br>
You can't.  Yet, here I am in this thread being referred to right and left as the greedy one... I just don't facking get it.  I'm one of the few people NOT abusing the reservation system (or at least having to use the reservation system in a way they don't want to).  I've made it clear in every raid I've run that if Rage is up, we're not going to be involved, we'll leave him quietly in place... so... no clerics were affected (or effected depending on which version of Verant speak you like).  Also, in every one of our raids the LIST for Ragefire squatting rights was already two or more deep WHEN WE STARTED.<br>
<br>
In short, abolohing FG reservations will only harm people wanting to use FG's the right way.  It won't get you your Ragefire any faster Europa Tribes, Watchers, or anyone else involved here... only Ragefire deciding to spawn will get that.. and only if you're not held up by that monk who's been there for three days...<br>
<br>
It's time people realized that Fire Giants have just been a scapegoat of the real problem, one spawn bottlenecks.  Removing them from the equation isn't going to effect the equation one iota... because FG's aren't what's stopping you from getting your epic... that 40 person line is going to stop it... and remember, an honest Fire Giant raid actually respects that 40 person line.<br>

So please, honestly find greed there.  There is only greed on one side of this problem right now... and it isn't on the side of the FG raiders... and its not universal to the people wanting their cleric epics.  There's a lot of misinformation and doublethink right now on this subject... more people posting their rage at not having their epic would be better served actually thinking the process through.<br>

I was also the cleric wanting Ragefire.<br>
<br>
It seems funny in a way one person spending 22 hours at a spot one the hope that he should get something that won't help him out much but would help out a lot of other people. You see that's what the cleric epic is, The stats are ok, their are better pieces out there for a cleric. Most clerics could care less about the status of having their epic. It is really the ability to bring back raid members midfight without mana loss, to get a raid going in under 10mins rather than 1 hour. That to me is what the cleric epic was supposed to be about.<br>
<br>
So I spend a month lvling up a monk to 17, I did this so I would not interfere in any scheduled FG raids. I then dedicated 22hours of my time alone while guildmates and friends are off having fun in the game. Staring at a blank wall for that long is not fun with not a single thing to kill not even some stupid green mob 20lvls below you.<br>
<br>
We are on a server that is more or less on a FCFS server and is by no means a helpful or great server other than that. What this meant 6 months ago was that if I was in a location first and claimed the spawn it was accepted as being valid. Today that is no longer true. Today FCFS on Brell means that if I have a raid crew at the point of attacking the spawn first before it is engaged then it is mine.<br>
<br>
What does this have to do with FGs and Ragefire? I'll explain that now and thank you for bearing with me. The server has decided that Ragefire is not reservable and that the FG's are. This is a simple fact we have all seen the voting results. FG's can be reserved for any reason what so ever. There are no checks or balances in place as to why you want to reserve them you just can.  In fact you can schedule the FGs and not even take them down. That is also not in the rules. There are many ways in which a person can abuse the system. But I digress from my original thought.<br>
<br>
So a person can by all rights reserve the FGs even though someone may be &quot;camping&quot; ragefire. Ragefire can then spawn but within the time window that you can not take down the FGs. The rules do not state that you can take the FGs down if ragefire is up. It also says you can not take them down if you have a Naggy raid scheduled. FGs have priority over both Ragefire and Naggy. So the camping person can do 1 of 2 things.<br>
1) They can ignore the FG reservation thus hurting the reputation of their guild and themselves for stepping on a FG reservation (the reason for the reservation does not matter).<br>
2) They can live by the reservation that is in place and hope that said raid is not brining along a Ragefire capable crew.<br>
<br>
Why does the camper have to hope that the person is not bringing along a Ragefire capable crew? FCFS rules as they stand on this server. Though I may have been the first person to spot Ragefire up and could have easily had a raid crew there in under 5 minutes I and the guild I belong to followed the second option of respecting the FG reservation.<br>
<br>
Now the reserved FG raid crew goes in to clear the FGs as they had intended and because they reach the lair with a full raid crew before the camping person could they have instant rights over the Ragefire spawn because a camper is not respected but a reservation is.<br>
<br>
So you see the group that scheduled the FGs did nothing wrong they simple followed the rules that were voted on.<br>
<br>
You can laugh off what I am saying or take a strong look at how FGs are being used and either do something about it. To say that allowing FGs to be reserved hurts no one think again. The joy I once had in this game got destroyed in a 22hour camp by which the rules of this board allowed me to be pissed on for lack of a better term.<br>
<br>
I have been very vocal in the past about how FGs should and shouldn't be used. I did not reserve FGs because I felt they should be for those learning FGs, I lvl'd a monk so that I would not interfere in anyones chance at experiencing and having fun in the game. In the end it did not pay off, my personal belief meant nothing and if I do decide to return to this game I once enjoyed and hangout with a guild and group of friends I really liked I will have to sell my beliefs out and start signing up for FG raids.<br>

No.<br>
<br>
Did the Fire Giant reservation change that 22 hour camp one minute? NO.  <br>
<br>
Assuming FG's weren't reservable, just FCFS like everything else, how would the dynamics for the Cleric change?  You'd still have to park an alt.  You'd still have to be hoping that alt would be there when Rage spawned.  You'd still have to hope you guys could get a raid there before someone else did.<br>
<br>
Remember, you were there first camping Rage... you weren't alone there though.  During the time I was on that raid (two hours of 'reserved' time), at least two other people I observed in tells or ooc were trying to get that raid slot.  Both were represented by guilds that could have had a raid in SolB in a second.<br>
<br>
What's my point?<br>
<br>
Removing FG reservations wouldn't change the Clerics plight.  It's still a long assed camp and crapshoot.  It still sucks.<br>
<br>
Of all the Clerics I know on your side of the dilemna Nasren, you've been vocally the most able to see both sides of this problem.  I'm trying to do the same from the FG side.  Seriously, in last weekends example how would the lack of my FG raid had ANY impact on your situation?<br>
<br>
There's two points I ask of everyone in the FCFS camp... if both can honestly be answered in a manner that is convincing, I could reverse my beliefs... (I'm willing to bet it can't be done though, I've been thinking this thing through looking for a compromise for a while):<br>
<br>
1) How would dropping the FG reservations actually speed up any cleric getting their epic?  Seriously.  <br>
<br>
2) Right now we've got a nice situation for Nagafen raiders.  FG raids defer to Naggy.  No one does an FG raid within 8 hours of a scheduled Naggy raid... this means Naggy raiders don't have to worry about repops while fighting Nagafen.  I'd think that Rokyl the FG wizard and a FG warrior that spawn in Naggy's room repopping in the middle of a Naggy raid could be, shall we say, really fricking bad.  How would a FCFS environment (which still would have to prove point one) not cause serious potential problems for Nagafen raids? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthorondar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorondar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tunare's Fury</span><br>  Posts: 570<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/4/01 9:38:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.watchers-brell.com/images/thor-shirt.jpg height=177 width=162></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Nasren</span><hr size=1> Send me email at Fletop@zombieworld.com when you can.<br>
<br>
Enraged is an understatement about how I felt this weekend when as a guild, we were directed to not flatten Fire Giants and kill Ragefire for Nasren.  Ragefire popped right before we killed the Dain, we were just prepping for the pull and arguing abuot the ethics involved in this encounter.  By the time we finished, the FG raid that was scheduled was supposed to start.  We argued more and slaughtered Wuoshi.  After we determined loot for Wuoshi, the FG raid was just started, approximately 1.5 hours from the designated start time.  If Rykilth didn't honor the reservation system for FGs and adamantly reign us in, Nasren would have his epic now, instead of being verbally abused by the FG &amp; Ragefire crew led by Puma, and Nasren wouldn't have felt that his 22 hours of dedicatedly camping Ragefire so he could help other people out better wouldn't have gone to waste.  Instead, the idea that the camping cleric is respected, is completely shot out the window.<br>
<br>
Fast forward one day later.  I reserve FG's for the approximate time Ragefire will spawn.  I gather enough guildies as well as a guildcleric that is at the ragefire step in the quest.  And we go.  Orejapincho is camping Ragefire, and I feel like a complete ass telling him that if ragefire pops while we are there for our FG raid, we WILL kill ragefire.<br>
<br>
What do you expect us to do?  If you keep FG's reservable, this scenario will happen over and over again, and I WILL be cut-throat about this.  I will walk over your ragefire crew, I will walk over you cleric camps, I will spawn ragefire and I will KS it from you so long as I have a FG reservation on the boards.  If you don't keep FG's reservable, I can then sit back and wait for my guildmate who camps ragefire to pop, and then I'll feel fine racing to the lair to buff and spawn ragefire, just like any other FCFS dragon there is out there: Severilis, Gorenaire, Talendor, Wuoshi, etc.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, I'll just be the @#%$ that tells the ragefire camping-cleric to foff pls thx.<br>
<br>
Not like it helps anything, Nasren's already had to endure what I don't think anybody should have to endure.<br>

<br>
So, if FG's hadn't been reservable none of this would have happened and guaranteed Nasren would have had his epic?<br>
<br>
Seriously?<br>
<br>
Not another guild would have been there... no one else would have planned to be there under any circumstances?  On another board somwhere (a guild board not an alt board), another group wouldn't have been planning on having someone in SolB and could have had a group to SolB in a heartbeat to get to Rage?<br>
<br>
Seriously?<br>
<br>
What happened to Nasren sucks.  FCFS wouldn't have changed that.  One Cleric WOULD have gotten his epic that time when Ragefire spawned.  Maybe it would have been Nasren, maybe it wouldn't.  Maybe the Watchers raid would have gotten there first Thorondar, maybe someone elses would have.   Fact is, with or without the FG reservations its a crapshoot... and Clerics get screwed in the process.<br>
<br>
Now, without the FG reservation, and assuming that Puma (to continue from Thorondars ire) would NOT have had a group in vacinity hoping for Ragefire (or assuming he'd not have been doing something similar to Nasren and camping a Feigner hoping for a pop and gambling on a raid size force being near)... yeah, I'd bet money on Watchers being their first with a raid force big enough to knock off Rage (that's five or seven of you guys?  respectfully, you're good... that wasn't intended sarcasm)... but the thing is... its equally probably that Nasren would have been screwed in an FCFS environment.<br>
<br>
My point remains, you're pointing all the right fingers all the wrong ways.  FCFS FG's isn't going to fix the Cleric dilemna.  It will (1) ensure that no one below level 55 sees a Fire Giant and (2) it WILL eventually fack over a Nagafen raid... but it won't protect or help a single cleric on this server.<br>
<br>
Lots of people are mobile.  Lots of people can camp alts (and do) in SolB looking for ragefire.  Lots of people won't respect your situation when their cleric needs an epic too... FCFS will also do one other nice thing... it's going to guarantee that a lot of you WILL be pissed at each other over who's got 'first dibs' on Ragefire...<br>
<br>
Think this thing through, the problem is much larger than Fire Giant reservations and the solution has nothing to do with FCFS.  It's just very convenient witch burning to think it does.<br>

Well, it wouldn't have been Puma.  He wan't even online at the time and didn't actually get online til an hour after his reservation start time.  It's fun sitting there knowing you are trying to do the right thing and respect someone elses fire giant reservation made only so they can pseudo-reserve Ragefire if he happens to be up then regardless of whether anyone else was there for Ragfire first.  It's more fun when they aren't even online.<br>
<br>
We could have had 5 groups there in 5 minutes to kill him.  Being ready or being first is not the problem.<br>
<br>
I am happy Puma got his epic.  He is a good cleric and I believe a good person.  I am sad that Nasren had to be put in that position though knowing that his 22 hours of camping was wasted because 8 more people wanted fire giants reserved than did not.<br>

Puma's raid ks'ed rage???  I spoke with Rykilth directly and we reached an agreement.  It is shameful to Me that You have such a problem with this when Puma deferred on Ragefire to let Rinivi have him when they were both camped in the lair at the same time.  We went within the guidelines set up by keeping fg's reservable.  Do I like it No.  Do I like denying another cleric his epic No.  As far as anyone verbally abusing Nathren it just didn't happen, unless he was receiving tells.  He kept saying over and over how pissed he was to have camped it so long and not be able to kill rage fire.  I understand that 100% I would feel the same way.  However after listening to him ooc every 5 minutes for the better part of an hour I simply asked him to let it drop and quit raining on Puma's day.  Puma is a class act who passed on rage for rinivi. Puma had tried to get rage by camping him and by doing fgs.  So what would You have us do?  When I realized a potential conflict might arise I contacted Your guild leader.  We had a conversation and reached an agreement.  As far as I am concerned We reached a diplomatic solution.  I guess communication and reaching things amicably between 2 guild leaders is not good enough for You.  Well, I am sorry Nathren didn't get his epic I truly am.  But to label the killing of ragefire by puma a ks after Rykilth and I had reached an agreement is both ludicrous and laughable.<br>

<br>
A) FG raid reservations have precedence over a cleric camping ragaefire<br>
<br>
B) The cleric camping Ragefire has precedence over a raid signed up for Ragefire (on the theory that Ragefire isn't reservable, but Firegiants are, and Ragefire is therefore &quot;campable&quot;).<br>
<br>
My point is, someone set the standard, because my impression from clerics camping Ragefire, that the camping cleric has precedence over the raid crew.  It has also been mentioned to me, that other nameless guilds walk through FG's in order to get to Ragefire irregardless of reservations.<br>

<br>
I have complete respect for Nasren, dunno him well enough to say I like or dislike the guy, but I respect what I've read of his before.  I'd have liked hearing he got his epic simply because of that.<br>
<br>
However, the misnomer everyone runs under here is that without that FG reservation everything would have been different... well, it would have, the problem is everyone is certain they know the outcome... my point is, they don't.<br>
<br>
Other possibilities in an FCFSFG environment:<br>
<br>
1) Puma wouldn't have made the reservation, he'd have just been there camping too... granted, he and Nasrens alt could have shared gem scores or something... both having a raid capable group ready to pop in with five groups in five minutes... its a weekend, its very possible.  Also, it's quite possible that without that reservation, Puma (sorry to pick on him, just continuing the example for continuity) would have logged in 18 hours earlier and been there before Nasren's alt...<br>
<br>
2) or maybe someone else would have (there's one other name referenced here, Quoj...) maybe he'd been there first with a raid capable force.<br>
<br>
3) Maybe two or three of you'd have been there simultaneously... who's to say who's going to respect the others First in FCFS... hypothetically Puma was there First, but Nasren has a raid there first... maybe Quoj is there first, but Thorondar is enraged and (following his quote) &quot;walks all over your Ragefire raid&quot;...<br>
<br>
4) Maybe an entire raid of Watchers would have sat on their asses for the weekend in SolB for that Ragefire spawn... THAT is the only way to have guaranteed Nasren would have his epic... and I can guarantee you you'd all be bored off your ass and pissed about it... THAT is what FCFS guarantees... because when it comes to getting their guild a Cleric epic, people WILL do that... if you dont do it you're just playing odds that aren't in your favor.<br>
<br>
Do you see my point?  FCFS does change how last weekend played out... only one Cleric still gets their epic over that same timetable... maybe the Cleric changes, maybe it doesn't.  The only guaranteed thing is that someone (or sometwo) would still be pissed at how it worked out...  Maybe its some Cleric from the guild { Big doo doo heads } that for some reason had people there and started Ragefire while Watchers groups (on standby admittedly) were porting into Lavastorm (since you've already indicated you weren't standing by IN SolB).  <br>
<br>
Trying to place the blame of this or the solution to this on Fire Giants is misplaced rage.<br>

Run through what you'd be doing if this were an open FCFS system (Fire Giants, Ragefire).  Multiply that set of strategies by what... 20 to 40 guilds capable of doing the same thing... divide that by one weekend... allowing for three Ragefire spawns thats three new Epic Clerics (CHEER... I DO like seeing Clerics get an epic and agree about its community benefits)... but that's still 17 to 37 pissed off guilds and an equal number of in game conflicts... hell, I can honestly see it boiling down to in game petitions, GM issues, Kill Stealing, and Ninja looting... THAT is what FCFS will do... right now, the barrier has been the Fire Giant reservations, abused or not abused<br>
<br>
Put aside your anger and think this through...<br>
