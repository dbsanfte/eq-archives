Well let me first start off by saying today I finished the 7th shawl and DAMN this thing is nice. <br>
Just like last time im going to give some helpfull hints as to the quest that I learned as I went threw the process to maybe help you out.<br>
<br>
First a INSANLY great walk threw was made by Adorean. I used this walk threw and it worked out GREAT. Thx Adorean. Your walk threw was Great and MOST helpfull. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=1775.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/feqtrad...1775.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Well with this walk threw I had to still find/figure out some stuff and what im going to post here is the stuff that i felt was most imporant to know. That can help you guys out completeing this quest. This is to be Used WITH that walk threw.<br>
<br>
Well first thing is handing betti your shawl so you recieve the patten you use at the END of the quest. IF YOU DISTROY IT don't worry. Cause you can rehand her the shawl and she will give you the Shawl again with the patten you use at the end. She tells ya to start by getting the basic rune made by getting a Runed Sea Shell with enduring breath &lt;Which is the hardest peice to get in this quest...imo&gt;. For this part i HIGHLY advise 2 full groups. At Least 2 Clerics and 2 Ench's and some mighty Tankage. On the WW side of Sirens Grotto there is a camp that there is located some Molkors, Ulthorks sorta Guarding a water pit. Best thing is to Clear the all the Ulthorks in this area and jump down into water kill the 2 mobs at the bottom of this tube of water. Make sure you have Enduring Breath Before u jump into the water tho. After killing the 2 mobs at the bottom of the tube there is 2 ways to go. one leads out of the water. one leads to a group of mermaids &lt;don't go that way&gt;. Have Everyone invis up and go the way that u can jump out of the water. You are now in a area FILLED with Sirens. Have your team duck into one of the Cubbies that the Ultorks are in and kill the Ultork and then start pulling all the sirens. Most of the Sirens in this area can be solo puled but it's better if a Monk pulls them incase or probs. The 55+ Sirens have a Chance of Droping the 2 Shells for the Ring 9th Ring quest or the 7th Shawl quest. Ring is more common then the Shawl one i noticed in the 2 times I went there. After You get your shawl go and do the pottery stuffage and get your Blank Rune.<br>
<br>
In the Next Step your needing to make a Burin it's using the skill of fletching. The hard part of this quest is getting the Hide since the only place to get it is in SG. The best spot I found was at the same area u jump into the water to get the Shell. Molkors spawn all over there. These are Clerics so they will heal up. But with a team of 6 they still drop pretty fast. Best Camp spot is in the hall behind the Water temple like thing that the pit is located in. Since one pat's to there just fight them in that hall so they dont' heal one another. While in SG u also need to Get a Tooth from a Swordfish. There is 2 located right there in the water. They droped 4 for 4 when we killed them so they are very common. Lastly you need a Tusk from a Ulthork. DO NOT confuse the Trunks that drop in SG for a Tusk. 2 completely diff things. Eastern Wastes Ulthorks drop them about 1 in 10 kills and are low level so go there to get one pretty fast. Now pending no failure you'll have your burin.Getting the Prayer to work just move around the room and make SURE you have NO typos in your Prayer or it might not spawn till you notice that u made a typo.<br>
<br>
Next you'll be using the skill of Brewing. Getting the Rubbing Alcohol is simple. Getting the Small peice of Velium is simple. Getting the Royal Kromrif blood is a PAIN. It does NOT drop on the &quot;Arena&quot; Side of the zone. Statements is it drops on the Tormax side off Kromrif mobs in the Quest hall. I got lucky and purchased mine for 2000. It had Droped off the Giant Nobles when running from EW side to WL side you pass the nobles or at least so im told. So if anyone can conferm this that would help ALOT of other people out. Getting the Fishing out of the way is easy just grab bait fishing pole and get to work. But, becarefull the fish is a meal so u might just eat it up. Heh I did by mistake hah. Just need to catch 3. I caught them pretty fast with a skill of 70. Since this isn't a Trade Skill I dumped 25 points into it. Just so I didn't waste alot of time sitting there boring fishing. <br>
<br>
Well that describes some of the hardest parts of this quest and helpfull things that might or might not assist u along. <br>

Easiest way to get Brewing up<br>

Now this is figuring u had your skill up high enough to make the 5th and 6th shawl.<br>
<br>
Easiest way to get Pottery up is to head to Unrest and Farm the zombies outside of the house. Kill them for thier skin. You can also buy them from newbies in the zone. these will help you get your skill up by making Lined Vials and Sealed Vials.<br>
lined Vial is <br>
Small block of clay+Lined Vial Sketch+Water+Zombie skin<br>
just distroy it if u succeed not worth the money to go threw kilning it and trying to sell it off to a rogue. Lined Vial will take you to skill 168. <br>
<br>
After that u can make Sealed Vials those are<br>
Small Block of clay+Sealed Vial Sketch+Water+Zombie Skin. Same idea just distroy if you make the vial. This will take you to 188. There is 2 other locs that are good for Zombie Skins. 1) the Wizard Portal in S kar. There is 2 spawn points where Skels or Zombies will spawn up to 8 zombies or skells can spawn at a time. It's all about luck tho. 2) In Eruds Crossing there is a downed boat out in the water just off the island. Underwater there is 3 spawn points of Zombies Pirates. They are on a Fast spawn timer and drop skins pretty often.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you guys all out and if u have any questions im online between the hours of 4pm - 8am PST.<br>

<br>
- All 3 pottery steps, trivial at 170<br>
- Both fletching steps, trivial at 182<br>
<br>
- Fish are catchable at 87 skill in fishing<br>
<br>
All I need to get is the alcohol and kromriff blood and (hopefully) will be done.<br>

Poof went my shell, and hard as heck it was to get too. Shell seems to be the biggest pain, because the nodrop tooth you can get with a single group at the pool in front of the little house near the WW zone. Molkor hide is tradeable, so you can do that or pick one up when your getting your tooth.<br>
<br>
Almost forgot, all three pottery steps were trivial to me at 165 as well.<br>

I have the exact script from the prayer and spent about two hours in there today trying to get it to spawn, retyping, and retyping, etc.  any particular place to stand/sit?  is it a timed spawned, ie once someone has spawned it it wont spawn again for xxx hours? very frustrating as this is my last piece at first attempt (i do have a second shell if i fail). <p>Kiatek<BR>
