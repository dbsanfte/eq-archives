It was as dark as a tomb with one exception, the council hall. It was lit like the casters wars of olden days. The room was fairly simple, large marble slabs made up the walls and floor, with the ceiling being made with an enchanted crystal of some sort. Patches of ivy decorated the walls and brought soem hint of life into this other wise dead environment.<br>
<br>
The room was void of furniture with the exception of the great table made from the finest platinum and endeared with several precious gems. There were no chairs only settings for several giant individuals.<br>
<br>
Tunare had called this meeting for reason of a uniting of forces against Veeshan and her &quot;children&quot;. Those in attendance, Innoruk, Cazic-Thule, Brell Serrilis and Fizzlethorpe. Such a diverse group had never before been assembled to deal with a common problem, and thus, Tunare decided that that was where they had failed. With the combined might of the 5 and there followers victory over Veeshan was within reach.<br>
<br>
There was a certain aire of distrust amongst the gods, for they had never really seen eye to eye on anything and none knew for certain if allegiances had been set to destroy one of the unfortunate. Tunare speculated that the only real threat could be Cazic and Innoruk for their common bond of the darker sides of life but other than that she felt no unrest.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, OK Spill it Lady Tunare, whats the deal,&quot;? Cazic Thule had decided to open this meeting and get to business.<br>
<br>
&quot;We all have a common foe, Veeshan and her children, and have all made attempts to subdue her and her kind to no avail. But I have a solution to our problem.&quot;spoke Tunare.<br>
<br>
A low murmur errupted from the assembled few as they learned of their purpose for being summoned to this floating rock. Coukld this be true? A unity of Gods to over take another of their kind? The blood was in the water and the frezy began to grow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are ye proposin that we get together and just take the scaley bitches place out from under her?, Wont be easy, even with my access to the under realms of Antonica,&quot;. The voice belonged to a rugged looking dwarf, who had crafted his children from his own image. This was Brell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats the matter small, dark and hairy, are you too afraid to go?,&quot; Innoruk errupted with laughter. &quot; I was sure I didnt have that effect on brother immortals.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Shut yer trap tooth pick afore I tear you a new arse!,&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;SILENCE!! Dont you see brothers, This is why we have yet to succeed in this matter, mindless bickering!&quot; Tunare had heard enough, and wasnt about to let these individuals ruin what she had planned. That and the fact that when they got into it, she genarally wound up with a head ache that would put the dead out of their misery.<br>
<br>
Once the commotion wound down and she had everyones attention again, Tunare began to lay out the ground work for her master plan. She knew that it would take more than just the collective to take down Veeshan for her power was immense and hardly within reach of just the few. She silently cursed the others who had refused her invitation to this meeting and silently wished for their childrens demise. The room fell silent as her words echoed of the cold smooth stone and into the night..............<br>
<br>
OK I kinda ran outta time and dont know exactly where to take this from here.. so if you think you can add soemthing good to this and get it going into a solid story that leads to the epic battle then please post it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uruffleschips.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruffles Chips</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/3/01 5:40:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Council</span><hr size=1> nice! reminds me of the dragonlance chronicles /applaud <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umontrosranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MontrosRanger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/3/01 2:43:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Continued.....</span><hr size=1> The meeting lasted several hours and housed many different ideas. Being that the alignment of powers in the room were vastly diversified many plans were brought forth. Cazic and Innoruk felt that a full out assault of all available resourses would prove victorious and swift, but Tunare and Brell knew better. They knew that the proposed plan by the lords of dark would only provide large scale casualties on their side and alert Veeshan to their scheem.<br>
<br>
Fizzlethorpe was more along the middle of agreeances. He felt as though a full scale assault would prove effective but it would have to be planned to perfection in order to be successful. He had been watching the mortals of Antonica and saw how effectively they could raid many of the most valuable treasures with planning and coordination. Silently he watched as Lady Vox had fallen, and again peering from the shadows had watched Lord Nagafen meet the same fate. Granted these were not 2 of Veeshans more powerful children but he could see the promise.<br>
<br>
&quot;Might I suggest a compromise of sorts in regards to the plans of attack on the table?,&quot; he spoke. The collective council turned to him, shocked at the fact that he had finally spoken. &quot; I have watched the mortals achieve victory over Veeshans broodlings Vox and Naggy with a mixture of whats been proposed.&quot;.<br>
<br>
They turned full attention to him, weary of his suggestion, for how could soemthing worked out by mortals succeeed at a level that took the might of the gods and their children. The mumblings of Cazic and Innoruk mingled with that of Brell and Tunare. Neither was really willing to conceed that they would have to each have input in order to achieve victory.<br>
<br>
&quot;How can we learn from mortals,?&quot; the last word sounding like a bad taste in Cazics mouth. &quot;We created them in one way or another, how can they be able to plan victory for soemthing we have long sought ourselves?&quot; The others chimed in in agreeance.<br>
<br>
Fizzlethorpe sighed and began to explain. &quot; Im not saying that they have planned our attack, but they have divised a system of sorts that allows them to gain victory over advisaries far greater than themselves. It does come with cost, and there are those that will fall but after all this is goibng to be a war and all wars yeild their share of death.&quot; He went into deep explanation about the organization of waves and strategy he had witnessed.<br>
<br>
&quot;That sounds good in theory and all but how are we supposed to know how to plan this to perfection seeing as how we have never had to do this before?&quot; Brell did have a point. Their knowledge of planned wars and raids was very limited at best. Normally a quick dispersal of their followers won victory.<br>
<br>
Fizzlethorpe knew what to expect from what he was about to suggest. He grinned from ear to ear and chuckled softly. &quot;Perhaps its time for us to ask the great ones below to, and let the followers become the leaders,&quot;.<br>
<br>
This prompted a monstrous outcry from the oher Gods. &quot;Mortals!?!?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Them leading us into battle?!?!!?&quot; Fizzlethorpe didnt look to see who had what objections for he knew he was right, and he knew that once they thought about it they would see it too. All to many times the Mortals of Antonica had turned to them for salvation and grace in the face of battle, and now it was time for them to make a call to the mortals for such things................<br>
<br>
<br>
Hehe once again I ran out of time, and also needed soem time to think about where to take this from here, so if yall have any ideas write em down and lemme know. Hope you enjoy it so far and stay tuned for more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=junkieplayer>JunkiePlayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/9/01 2:56:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Sweet</span><hr size=1> Thats pretty damn good.

He lived in harmony with all of Tunares blessed creations in Faydwer. As a ranger he was more accute to the sounds and sights that most men would take for noise or just another tree. He had reached his 60th season and had been on many successful raids like the one the Council of Gods had planned. <br>
<br>
He had just left a meeting with his brothers and sisters and was on his way to scrounge up tales of things to be accomplished for his family to attend to. His family, AKA Silent Redemption, had become reknowned for their great and epic battles in places much to dangerous for many to travel. The latest of which was the one that caught Fizzlethorpes attention, the raid on Veeshans Peak. <br>
<br>
Fizzlethorpe knew that his apperance to the humble wood elf probably would not help their cause, at least not yet, so he traveled back to the cold stone room on the Air Plane. <br>
<br>
&quot;Lady Tunare, I believe I have found one who can assist us in our attempt,&quot; the grin spreading ever further across his partially shadowed face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then where is this great mortal who will assist us?&quot; Tunare was still very much agitated about asking mortals to help in any way with a war between fellow gods, as was everyone else. The word great rolled out of her mouth like the taste of spoiled mutton, or charred dark elf parts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you see Lady Tunare, the one I have found I have yet to approach. He is one of your devout followers, one who goes by the name of Ganon....&quot; He trailed the name off into silence so he could witness her reaction. &quot;I felt it best for you yourself to approach this elf yourself, for you see he might not be so cooperative should I be the one to approach him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tunare was at ends by this time. Of course it was a priviledge , not to mention bragging rights among gods,to have one of her own be the one who was great enough to plan such an awesome strike. On the other hand she was furious that it was to be her that would have to approach a mortal to help. This was something she wasnt eager to do, regardless of what it could mean for her, for all the Council.<br>
