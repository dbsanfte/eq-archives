Do not worry.   I know things look strange here. But I assure you, this is a tavern in this strange world.  Yes my friend, we are not in Norrath at this time.  LOL come and try this strange elixir they call Teeekilla here.  You asked me to explain a bit, so please sit??.<br>
<br>
I was born the son of a scullery maid in a well to do merchants house. We all start somewhere my friend.  I grew up in a place that was part of a land called the Sword Coast.  You say you have not heard of this place? Well sip on your drink, and let me wander through this tale.  I was born in a town of no consequence.  My mother, she worked hard for her money, and tried to raise me to be better than what she believed she was.  I played with children in the street and heeded my mother and her friends only when they could grab me up and get my attentions with a quick cuff to my head.  My father was never mentioned and for whatever reason, I never learned anything of him.  For ten years, I ran through the streets of dirt and played and knew of no other way of life.<br>
<br>
Ahh, but that eleventh year.  On my birthday that year, I managed to appropriate a bottle of wine to celebrate my day of birth.  There were several of us celebrating; we all thought I was so clever in stealing that bottle without the merchant ever noticing.  Hah young and foolish.  The bottle was drugged; my companions and I were all quickly asleep and sold to various ?guilds? in other towns. When I woke up I was looking at the ugliest dwarf I have ever met.  I was informed that I was going to enjoy my new life as a thief for the Guild Of Nights Silence in a harbor town, far from my mother, with no chance of ?turning down? my new ?choice?.  (A quick and painful lesson of a lash was applied at this time to get my attention and agreement.)<br>
<br>
Drink my friend, I am known here, I have what is referred to as a tab, so please relax and enjoy.  Your platinum is no good tonight.<br>
<br>
So, where was I?  Ahh yes.  What followed was an arduous, thrilling, and painful seven years.  Seven years my friend, to learn all the skills I needed to become a thief.  Yes my friend a thief.  Not the best, not the worst, but a thief.  Go ahead and check your purse, it is still there.  Seven years of training under that aforementioned dwarf., very thorough that training. And my friend, believe what you will, but dwarfs are as intelligent, cunning, observant, and unrelenting as any other race.  No well-laid escape plan ever went fulfilled, no lapses on my part were ever missed (or unpunished), and success was ever met with praise and a raising of goals.  Yes that dwarf, he was a hard taskmaster, damn quick with that lash, but he beat discipline into me, and came close to being almost liked.  But as he would say with that rare smile of his, ?You are not my son, you are not a master thief yet, come! Quit this useless display of emotion and to the practice room, your burglar skills are most lacking you cow footed human.?<br>
<br>
My friend, you must try this delicacy, they call it cheese sticks here.<br>
<br>
The worlds, ahh I am getting there my friend, I am getting there.  On my eighteenth year I was turned loose to a full-fledged thief, with only my fervent desire to pay the Guild of Nights Silence a full third of anything that may come may way. My friend, believe me, I have seen what has happened to those who cheat the Guild, and I will not speak of it here. And believing in my own belief in my immortality, I left that harbor town..  First I went to the town of my birth, to learn my mother had died while I was in my apprenticeship, died of a mishap.  Suffice to say the person who caused the mishap, met with a misfortune himself, afterwards I found it convenient to travel throughout the Sword Coast.  (There being something of a picture, resembling me, and a reward of some type.)  Ahh you say what of the crooked vendor, my friend, he also is in a guild of thieves, and more to the point, I did not have the Blooprice to pay his guild master, so he lived, walks quite well now with his cane.<br>
<br>
So there I was, peacefully traveling around to see the sights.  When, I chanced on a group of adventurers.  Their plan was to explore and loot a dungeon.  Ah ha say I, I will wait till they depart this dungeon and loot them.  So I waited most peacefully for the intrepid party to reappear.  And, as I hoped, they were tired and worn from their experience in the dungeon.  Waiting till the quiet of the night, I entered their camp and went to appropriate them of their reward.  I did mention I was not a master thief, good, good.  They had a master thief in their party.  One who did not sleep while I crept up, but one who thankfully was a heart beat slow.  The term they use here is ?I ran like hell?, straight into the dungeon.  Not the wisest choice, but I was still alive and running.  Yes, you are correct, I did not note all the turns and twists in my passage.  I survived by sheer speed, and the exhaustion of the party members.  (Today, yes I understand the need to plan to enter a dungeon, you are quite right to laugh at me my friend, and yes I had no supplies but my knife.)  Not knowing my way, and fearing pursuit, I pressed on when I suddenly discovered a trap door, ahh I did mention I was not a master thief.  <br>
<br>
Drink my friend, this teekilla is quite good is it not?<br>
<br>
What I found, and most assuredly avoided by others, was a trap set by a mighty mage.  He decided to safeguard his corpse and belongings by sending would be looters, and one foolish thief, to another world.  Yes my friend another world, Norrath by name.  Nay, do not ask me, I have no understanding of spells of that magnitude.  I was suddenly transported to Norrath, a strange town with very different and varied people.  I was alive and completely lost.  I decided to try to continue on with my life immediately, by trying to pick the pouch of a well-dressed man passing me by in the throng.  I reasoned, with some coin of this strange place, I would be able to survive and prosper, make contact with the local thieves guild, try to rob a paladin.  My friend, its not a good idea to try to rob Paladins.  They cannot be bribed, they are very severe with thieves, and can be downright unfriendly.   Not any Paladin, but an officer.  You have met him; he is the serious type is he not?  What stayed his hand, and stayed the flat of his blade, I do not know.  I asked once, he did not reply, that is the night I learned of Skill of Balance.  (You hold a fine steel two-handed long sword in each hand, straight out from your sides, at shoulder level.  You stay that way till you are told to stop.  Merko ate a long dinner that night.)  But stayed his hand he did.  And I started a new apprenticeship.  One I would have scoffed at, but one that started to intrigue me.  It started with the simple desire not to be beaten by this stern paladin, to running errands while I learned the language of Norrath, to full training to become a paladin.  My tutors were Katrina, Merko, and even the Guild Leader himself.  Another seven years I labored.  And it was labor my friend.  Paladins can be, in their own way, quite a jolly group, but they did not approve of some of the vices I brought along with me.  Granted they managed to get rid of most, but I still retain a few.  Another drink my friend?<br>
<br>
Seven years, seven quick years, looking back at it now.  I have made friends here, and some enemies.  Sir Lucan has no cause to love me.  I have traveled about Norrath, I have seen much my friend, I hope to see more.  I have been welcomed to a group, Circle of Souls, they are known as.  We have accomplished much, and hopefully will travel quite far together.  I have learned some of the same lessons in both my apprenticeships.  I am steadfast with my friends, deadly to my enemies, unselfish with my loot (if you think being selfish with loot is a good thing, my friend, the Guild of Nights Silence will quickly disabuse you of that notion) and polite with other travelers.<br>
<br>
What my friend, what does this have to with your original question?  Whence came my name?<br>
<br>
S ? Son of Shayla the Sweet  <br>
Ro ? Rohokan, the ugliest dwarf I ever met my friend.<br>
Pes- Paladin Estewwen Silverhands, a stern paladin who I have yet to see smile, but taught me honor.<br>
<br>
And that my friend is what I carry as my banner.<br>
<br>
What, you say, you want to know how I found this strange world.  HA, drink up my friend that is a tale for another night.  Come, let me show you a place I know, you may have heard of it, Guk it is called, they have some good loot there????<br>

As for my surname, I was quite a poor young Pally..always getting jumped by Orcs and running in any direction that I could to get away from them, most of the time right in the middle of the woods where I would die and not be able to find my corpse <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I lost a lot of patchwork and rusty weapons let me tell you..<br>
I had low starting strength so I was always encumbered and I would go through rations like crazy! With the meagar money I had (Being poor anyway, and constantly replacing armor) I could never keep myself feed and often went without rations for a bit.  Well, once I got better equiptment (and wasn't encumbered) I found that I was still eating rations like crazy, so when I hit 20 I decided that his name should be something to do with his eating disorder-hence &quot;SnakPak&quot;.  <br>
<br>
**Sad thing is, I started fishing to get fish to eat, great idea..but..before I knew ANYTHING about being a Paladin, I found out that instead of fishing up fish I could just hack them down in the water and Volia!
