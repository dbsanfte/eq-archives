Go read EQ Cleric. You will see an increasing number of posts regaurding clerics wanting more self-reliance (solo ability/utility) because thier grouping opprotunities are drying up slowly. Melee's are more and more being able to solo effectively, for exping people are prefering more small 2-3 man teams in &quot;safe camps&quot; where literally any healer will do up to an including paladins rather than hitting things like Ssra, new CT, etc. Until recently I thought giving druids better healing would simply marginalize clerics in more zones (still probably will) and since it really is the thing we have going for us it puts a lot of clerics on the defensive. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bear with me for a minute and understand a little something. Cleircs and most who love the class have always loved two things about the class. 1) We heal/buff and we do it well, it has gotten us the groups we NEED to exp and as others close the gap we get territorial. It is the one thing we have for 3 years been able to count on allowing us a slot in a group. 2) This is where it gets tricky, We have remained a static and stable class for three years. Think about this for a second. With the advent of RoK, SoV and SoL, many classes went through role changes and clerics simply got upgrades to what they already do well (buff/heal). Our role and core abilities have not changed for three years. Us old clerics are getting set in our ways <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .  With a slow encroachment on our most basic specialization (healing) and no real change to ourselves we natually feel threatened. <br>
<br>
Enter caster balancing. As Absor put it, it is coming in bits and pieces. I have seen this in the clerics already. Two little things come to mind. Tinkering with Judgement (I am still skeptical of the this actually being an improvement but, that is another thread entirely) and the change to Hammer of the Sun from a Dawncall proc to a right click Dawncall. I think the caster balancing for clerics means undead utility in the form of damage output and a limited form of buffs relating to undead ( lets face it Paladins and Necros have far outstripped clerics in dealing with undead). How does this affect druids? Well with even a decent change of role for clerics in groups this opens the door for healing improvement for druids in raids without infringing the ONLY role a cleric has to offer a group. In short, clerics find a second role they can fill in a group, healing is impoved for druids which helps raids and the bleed over into exp groups this healing will cause is marginalized by a cleric having a second role to fill when it comes to grouping and the ability to solo more effectivly.<br>
<br>
 I could be entirely off on this but, it seems to be heading this way by my reckoning. Looks like some of old clerics/dogs might have to learn some new tricks from you nice druid folk about versitilty in a group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><img src=http://eshamlin.home.mindspring.com/lith.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulithahntalon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lith Ahntalon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/23/02 4:08:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucclothar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ccLothar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 7:16:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> I've never seen a mob resist Warrior defensive.

I'm very reluctant to admit this, but it does seem that Verant is trying to think before they act now. I suspect this has a ton to do with the ancient jedi..oops nerfmaster (aka Brad McQuaid) moving on. We'd all like to see balance soon in one major patch, but if they are serious about doing it right, then taking things one variable at a time is the only correct, logical way to proceed. I'd much rather they take their time and do things right the first time, than screw up and go back and retro-nerf any improvement they made which turned out to be too good.<br>
<br>
I was also thinking and couldn't come up with an answer. (maybe someone can) Since McQuaid left, can you think of any class ability nerfs pertaining to casters? <br>
Some items sure, but anything along the lines of reduced damage on dots, mobs with unalterable movement rates, unstunnable/unmezzable?<br>
<br>
Last thought, I got to agree with Fox and Korwin...it doesn't do anyone any good to call for nerfs to another class (e.g. Manaburn/CH/Slow/Defen-sive/etc). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uspuzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spuzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 10:58:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thoughts</span><hr size=1> NT <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uspuzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spuzy</A> at: 5/23/02 9:45:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufiremynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Firemynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 12:55:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thoughts</span><hr size=1> I know it seems logical to &quot;compare&quot; the abilities of various classes in order to balance them. However, some people are far too obsessed with the assumption that improvements to one class must always be matched or offset by similar improvements to a sister class, otherwise it has to be an indirect nerf.<br>
<br>
Example: every time someone mentions a DoT upgrade for druids, a bunch of number crunchers fly out of the woodwork to insist that shaman DoTs are &quot;supposed&quot; to be better than druids' and proceed to enumerate a list of DPS numbers.<br>
<br>
Supposed to be better? Says who? Sorry if I'm missing a page out of my EQ manual, but I've never read any rule stating that shamans are absolutely required to always have better DoTs than druids. <br>
<br>
Heck, if a better DoT would give druids a raid-beneficial, raid-critical role, that would be great -- shamans already own a raiding role (e.g. SLOW) and no class can effectively take that away from them. Unfortunately, unless they come up with something lure-based, a DoT upgrade isn't really going to bump druids up from last rung on the raid ladder.<br>
<br>
Example: every time someone mentions a healing upgrade for druids, some self-appointed spokesman for cleric justice comes along and complains that healing is the only thing they have to contribute, that druids have sow/snare/ports, blah blah blah, and if we're going to be versatile from 1st-50th level, we should pay for it 50+ by not being able to compete with clerics for grouping and raiding.<br>
<br>
Well by that logic, after 3 years of having a PERMANENT seat at every raid, maybe it's time for clerics to &quot;pay for it&quot; by giving up a little raid desirability to druids? :P<br>
<br>
Seriously, though, I'm amazed every time I hear a cleric shudder at the thought of not being first choice for every high end encounter. <br>
<br>
Attention Clerics ---<br>
If you don't show up, raid is cancelled! <br>
If druids had a 3khp heal, yet clerics didn't show up, raid would STILL be cancelled!<br>
<br>
Example: every time an upgrade to druid nukes is mentioned, someone comes along and complains that druids are a priest class not a damage class, and we better not dare ask for anything comparable to a wizard. <br>
<br>
Well, I'm not asking for manaburn, I'm not asking for a familiar, and I'm not asking for lure nukes. However, I don't see why two classes couldn't share in being the &quot;best&quot; at dealing spell-based damage. Actually, I rather like the idea that druids would be the undisputed top damage-dealers of the three priest classes (the other priest classes are *specialists* in support/healing), just as wizards are of Int casters (the other int casters are *specialists* in support/pets).<br>
<br>
Most of the folks who want druid healing improvements, emphasize the &quot;support healer&quot; role. Over time, though, it has become increasingly obvious that Verant doesn't consider &quot;support healer&quot; as a unique raiding role; and they have apparently decided that secondary role belongs to shamans -- think about it --Torpor is the perfect HoT to use on the raid's casters hit by incidental AoE, and on top of that, shamans already have the same spot heals as druids.<br>
<br>
I don't envy VI. What we refer to simply as &quot;caster balancing&quot; is a heck of a lot more complex than it appears on the surface. But I sincerely hope VI's developers won't allow themselves to be too heavily influenced by complaints made by the three caster classes who are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> already</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the most desirable casters for raiding. At best, it's a bit suspicious that any member of those particular classes would be so vehemently opposed to VI addressing problems with the druid class that have been largely neglected for two expansions.<br>

Need a port, ask a Druid, need a priest for an exp group, ask a Cleric or Shaman.  Pretty simple.  Porting has absolutely nothing to do with game encounters, it's just a convienance that is being nerfed by Verant to equate everyone.  SOL requires no ports, and Verant will continue to make it easier to get around without the need for ports.  Did I make a Druid solely to port, boy, what a fun existence that would be.  People who can two box make Druids simply to port, and nothing else.  Look at it from this perspective, does anyone who has any knowledge with EQ think that Druids are better then Clerics or Shamans?  It's fairly obvious that Clerics and Shamans are much better then Druids for 99.9% of any EQ encounter, now does that seem balanced?  To me, soloing means nothing, 90% of the game for me and for anyone in the &quot;end game&quot; is raiding.  Plain and simple.  <p>Cheers, <BR>

Honestly, though, you can't take those whiners or demagogues seriously, especially when they ask for <b>complete retroactive nerfs</b> to our class or any class. It's this whole quid pro quo mentality that reveals the envy, and it's a rather superficial way of looking at caster balance as you pointed out. Enough of that BS, I say. Druids are versatile yet hardly omnipotent as some say in their "you can do everything" speeches. Hah. I can repeat at any time my list of what we can't do. Second, our versatility already has drawbacks, even at the lower levels, in that some of our spells have zero functionality indoors. Again, VI is well aware of this although others are not.<br>

Also on the improved dots topic, thats really not a solution for the multiple group encounters. 10 Wizards can nuke at the same time, 10 clerics can heal at the same time, and yes 10 warriors can hit the mob at the same time, but only 1 druid can dot. Something unique is really needed here, kinda like necros got the stat taps and mindwrack and such, but in line with the Druid class.<br>
<br>
Nukes... whoever it was that said they can keep up with a wizard at it, your comparing yourself to the wrong wizards. They have better nukes by FAR, add concussion to that, and a wiz that knows what they are doing would smoke us at nuking any day.<br>
<br>
Manaburn... special ability, once every 144 minutes ... really have no problem with it. It is not the reason wizards are so desired/needed for &quot;raids&quot;.<br>
<br>
Pretty much to sum it, a change is needed that would make it so that we are no longer the class that nobody would notice is missing from a high end encounter. <p><br>

I hope my original post didn't imply that every time we make a change to address class balance that we intend to give something new to all classes. That wouldn't make much sense, as it would contribute to a constant increase in all classes power, and wouldn't necessarily address the balance issue that caused the original change.  If a particular class is lacking in some critical area, than it makes sense to do something to address that class and not all of the others.<br>
<br>
There will certainly be parts of class balancing that change the relative power of one class when compared to another.   Class balancing happens because a given class is underpowered or overpowered when compared to where we feel they should be.  This obviously will change relative power as we improve a weaker class and leave the others where they should be.  <br>
<br>
Also, class balance isn't always dictated by comparing different classes.  A large part of getting the balance right is looking at a class individually.  Does the class provide reasonable value to a group?  Does the class adequately fill a number of roles?  Does the class have sufficient power to deal with the situations we expect them to face?  These questions are as important to getting the balance right as the more common concerns that class A is &quot;better&quot; than class B.<br>

I don't envy VI. What we refer to simply as &quot;caster balancing&quot; is a heck of a lot more complex than it appears on the surface.

Honestly, the dev team tries to be objective about all of the feedback we get.  There are some excellent ideas we see from players every day, and there are just as many ideas that sound like good changes but would make EverQuest much less fun to play in the long run.  We try to seek out and listen to many sources of information, but when it comes to making a change we go with what we think is best for the game, understanding that it will make some people unhappy.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure it's possible to make a change that *every* player will love.  Changes that seem entirely favorable to most people always seem to make someone sad.  We'd love to have changes go in and know that every player will love them, but with our huge and diverse player base, there's just no way to please everyone with a given change.  As an example, we recently improved pets for mages and necromancers.  I was surprised to see at least one player post that he was angry that his pet was better because now it was harder to outdamage it.  <br>
<br>
So, the point is - we're working to make EverQuest the best game it can be, and we want players to have a fun and rewarding time, no matter what class they choose to play.  We weigh the feedback we get from different groups carefully, but in the end we're going to make the best decision we can for the game as a whole, knowing that it won't be the change some players hoped for.<br>

Thanks for playing,<br>

Your post best conveys my exact sentiments !<br>
<br>
As for a **specific** Class Defining Raid role ... the only thing that has crossed my mind over and over would be some sort of Anti-Summoning Spell. This spell would NOT be cast on the MOB rather on a player. That way we can keep the Enchanter alive when he/she tashes or the Shaman alive when he/she slows.<br>
<br>
The spell would not pull aggro from the Main Tank because it would be cast on a PLAYER not a MOB. It would have to be very short term, something along the lines of 10 to 12 seconds and have a recast time of 1 minute. That way a Raid would need 2 to 3 Druids at a raid to keep your 'chanter, Shammy and/or Cleric alive because we could not cast this &quot;buff&quot; on more then one target per MOB encounter. Or the recast time could be as low as the duration of the buff ( ie 10 to 12 seconds ) but that would allow someone to be completely immune to summon for the whole fight because we could chain cast it.<br>
<br>
Of course, just because the MOB can not summon the 'chanter/shaman/cleric does not mean that they would be completely safe. The MOB could always just run after them, but at least if done right, the 'chanter/shaman/cleric might have enough room to back away and hope the Tanks can regain aggro before he/she gets pummeled to death once the MOB reaches them.<br>
<br>
Another way a MOB could reach out and touch someone who has an anti-summon buff on would be a well placed AoE spell in the direction of the 'chanter/shaman/cleric which of course would put our little caster huddle in the corner at risk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, maybe it is just me, but the ONLY real beneficial &quot;Class Defining&quot; raid ability left that is not already in the game would be a spell along this line. Also, it does not seem like it would be overpowered or make encounters trivial for the reasons I listed. /shrug<br>

<br>
The cost of this spell is FIXED, it is obtained at 39 <br>
and is the key factor in all high end encounters. <br>
<br>
No analog of this spell exist, no complete blast <br>
(would be a level 39 wizzard spell removing half the hps of any mob ;-) ) <br>
<br>
<br>
This spell is only one whose power increase with the level of the caster, a druid firestrike will do (almost) the same <br>
damage at level 34 or 60. <br>
<br>
<br>
There are two way to  solve this issue ;<br>
<br>
supress complete heal and replace it by a powerfull healing line (Sh1 at 30 healing 1500 dmg, Sh2 at 45 healing 2000 costing more mana  and so on sh3, sh4 ..)  <br>
<br>
in that case some high end encounters may become <br>
impossible <br>
<br>
<br>
Give shamen, druid complete heal (with 1.5  the cleric cost)<br>
and this around level 50. <br>
<br>
Those are just suggestions, the main thing is that the <br>
critical feature is and will be always complete heal.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 7:51:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What about this...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.

<br>
Wise, you got any idea what kind of mana regen shamans got with the Canni line? Seriously? Anyone who suggest CH for shamans need to go talk to their local shaman about it and when he stopped rolling on the floor laughing about having CH and what he can do with it so can you talk some about mana regen...<br>
<br>
Now, lets move on. Something I keep seeing poping up is druids saying they can NOT heal good enough to keep random_player_01 in. Usually they compare themself to healing the MT (lets say 6.5k for a easy low number these days) or rampage/secondary MT (also at 6.5k hp). Now, on a raid with something rampaging (Archie, Rhag2, anything that wont be slowed and cripple wont land on/stay on) big time so will ONE druid not keep it up, I would even dare to say two druids would have a hard time (depending on the magic dice, defensive yada yada yada) to keep it up. I dont think anyone is going to question that either. The thing that seem to be the common mistake though is saying this is ONLY about high end raiding or everyone will end up in high end raiding only. That is false, you will all end up doing exp for the simple reason you want to regain those four deaths learning mr AoW ver. 2.0 that decided to stomp your raid a few times before you killed him. Any form of direct heal will impact the regular exping, lets not stick this under the chair.<br>
<br>
The story behind CH was that it was intended as a non combat healing spell (therefor the long casting time) and it was of limited use (though I CHed that 1500hp monk when I got it and though I was mana efficent, those where the days), as everything moved on so did the tanks HP and it became a corner stone to cleric healing. Well all know what happend etc etc. Now, CH is not a true complete heal (aka 100% heal of target), it is a 10k heal (10.5k with the 5% bonus). Not knowing what VI can and can not do so will I make a assumption that VI can NOT make a true % heal atm. They can only do a coded number heal (aka you heal for 5k not 50% of target etc) so does that leave a problem. How do you make a heal (and healing is what usually is brought up) that dont balance regular exping (where single druid can do the job in most zones, shamans in even more and the idea was that two of them where suppose to replace a cleric which is not the case today due to "insert random long list of caster complaints on mudflation") but still bring them in line on raids?<br>
<br>
Some druids say they want CH, I say take it so I can do something else then sit in the CH chain. Let the druids do that (;. I am willing to bet most druids will be coming screaming after you done that for half a year or so. There is hands down nothing as boring as sitting in a CH chain and 99% of all tactics is based on some form of CH chain... But then I want to be getting some real solo/group abilities in return so I can bring something to the other spectrum of the end. I dont think many clerics would turn down trading "raid power" to be less of a demand raiding wise (guilttrips etc is daily for many clerics if they simply not feel like raiding that night) for some more group/solo power. Where druids got very good solo/group power (guess this will be flamed and nitpicked by two sides, you can quadders and the we can quadd but class X do exp faster) but want more raiding power. I love if I instead of having to bring my cleric to the raid this night could bring out my ranger because instead because we had enough clerics for the core healing needed and got enough replacement druids to take up the slack in the other end.<br>

Humm, I guess that was rambeling enough (;<br>
