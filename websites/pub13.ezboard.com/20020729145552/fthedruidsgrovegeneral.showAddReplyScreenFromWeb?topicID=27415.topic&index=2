Unfortunately that is the attitude that has brought druid's to the state we're in now.  That, &quot;Every one hates Druids, lets not rock the boat&quot; mentality has kept us from advancing along the same grade as the rest of the game.<br>

Individually</span><hr size=1> I agree with Araxx, but then I also think my definition of 'uber' doesn't quite match the definition attached to it by the masses.<br>
<br>
I think .. the druid class is .. perfect. Sunbeem's life as a druid has been wonderful (and if I do say so .. she is utterly adorable, and as powerful as she chooses to be .. even if she is always a bit wisdom challenged). I have loved her (and her skills in druidry) since the day she (and all her clones) were born. I have never ever felt I lacked anything at all to be honest. <br>
<br>
I know people who are in those high level raid catagories .. will differ with me on this (and I feel sure that, given what YOU want to do in that rarefied air place, you have some legitimate issues .. but .. the versatility of the druid is always what has made me glad I was born of that class .. and it continues to delight me to this day - over 3 years since I began dipping my delicate toes into this world we know as Norrath. <br>
<br>
As I heard someone say just recently .. the only thing Verant did not anticipate when they brought Norrath to life .. was the players LOL. The players are out of their control, folks. But .. they have to deal with us all .. and .. though I too have had moments along the way when I did not feel &quot;I&quot; was 'the' most important thing in VIs world (and .. on a bad day .. add to that .. the fact that I have, in passing, thought I SHOULD be .. LOL) .. I think they have done (and continue to do) an amazing job. <br>
<br>
I remember a world, way back when, when we didn't even know about Norrath .. and it may not even have existed! In that world .. I was not good at running fast, I could not leap into the air and levitate, I could not just wish myself on the other side of the continent, and I certainly couldn't fight off many of life's foes with the dexterity I now can. My attempts at healing others .. were limited to bandages and hugs for bruised knees, and Kleenex for snotty, bleeding noses. Now .. I am POWERFUL and IN CONTROL. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am thankful for the moments and the means to experience those feelings .. even if it is only 'fantasy'.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br>  Posts: 647<br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 2:01:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27415.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creation of a new type of petition?

Hmmm...the Dark Side I sense in you, yesss.  Brainwashed by VAKs you are.  Unaware, are you, of the limitations of the Druid Force.  <br>
<br>
No farming druids have there been past level 30 for a long time.  No.  Only port box Druids do I see an abundance of.  <br>
<br>
Hunted down by Darth Verant have the real druids been.  Into monks and warriors and shaman have they changed.  <br>
<br>
Better is it to be mediocre at many skills, or the master of fewer skills?  Think on that, padewan, and realize, you will, that the Druids have long since seen their days of power. Hmmmm.<br>

Hello, what universe do you live in?  The farmers on my server are most certainly not druids (ie, a druid is their main).  The poorest chars I know are druids.  The ones with all the cash, from &quot;farming&quot;, are melees (WAR/MNK/ROG), clerics, chanters, and wizzies.<br>
<br>
It's true druids have a harder time getting groups.  So they tend to solo more.  Solo where?  Mostly outdoors.  Oh yeah, lots of good loot there ;P<br>
<br>
The chars who get good groups together more often, go to interesting places to XP, and they get the good loot.  They win a roll, and if they can't use it or twink it, they sell it.  That is the &quot;farming&quot; of present day EQ.<br>

<br>
You see, that's where you're wrong. Having more tools at your disposal makes you think less. When you have to rack your brain around a problem it gets you on your toes and makes you a better player. The less tools you got, the more skills AS A PLAYER you gain. You totally missed my point.<br>
That is why there are so many bad druids out there. I absolutely HATE having a druid in my group when playing my alts. Why? Because they know Jack $hit about what being a Druid is all about. All they do is nuke too early, don't regen, forget about thorns, forget to snare, etc... Why does this happen? Because, as we all know, and I quote 'Druids are easy to play, but it is not easy to play a Druid well'. So you see, when 75% of the Druid population out there are the 'farming I'm so uber type druid' who don't know how to play, it doesn't help the rest of us at all. All those extra skills you mentioned just make it easier to do the same thing, they don't make you a better player.<br>
Personally I would like to see these people get out of our class and go back to where they came from.<br>
Oh, and Tatankawd, people create Druid alts to farm. Don't be misled. Go into any mid level dungeon and do a /who. Then ask those in /roleplay what class they are. Druids are everywhere. I can go into ANY mid level dungeon and farm what I like if I wanted to, and you should know it.<br>
<br>
This is not an attack (As you can see I don't 'Duh' people or ask them 'What universe do you live in?') but a very serious point. Tell me you are 100% happy with all the druids you come across and I'll gladly reconsider my posture. But I've seen things from your point of view and I know what I'm talking about. It is sad, but it is true.<br>

<br>
i always have to wonder one thing....<br>
<br>
why is there the automatic assumption that just because one farms, one cant really play their class? =)<br>
<br>
i suppose i fit the definition of &quot;farmer drooid&quot; quite well.  im a solo player, i prefer to solo and hunt alone (classic anti-social druid type personality), i genuinely enjoy playing in lower level zones and wandering around killing things and collecting little goodies for my twinkage pile.  i really like farming things for my tradeskills and quests, dont mind sitting around for hours on end killin little things or waiting on other things to spawn.<br>
<br>
and this solo life ive undertaken for most of my druidic career taught me how to be a better druid.  i learned the layout of dungeons, agro control, pathing and agro, game mechanics, all by playing by myself, all by RELYING on myself.  a solo druid has no cleric to heal them or tank to taunt off them, has no monk to solo pull for them or wizard to power nuke.  a solo druid does it all on their own.<br>
<br>
so lets just drop this &quot;i'm a real druid and they're just a twink/farmer&quot; holier-than-thou attitude.  its way too reminiscent of the nasty attitudes so many old rogues had/have against any &quot;new&quot; rogues/twinks/druids.  we are all just people playing characters, regardless of how we play or how WELL we play, and regardless of what class button we happen to have clicked first. <p>-K<br>

Just one question: How do your solo abilities make you a better group player? The memmed spell layout is TOTALLY different. I'm not showing a 'holier-than-thou' attitude, I'm addressing an issue, and if you felt included in my description about people creating Druid Alts to farm dungeons, well, just ask yourself whether you're one of them.<br>
I'm sick of getting $hit because there are so many bad players around due to the nature of a Druid's skill allowing for this. Do NOT get the issues mixed up.<br>
I'm a very humble player, I'm not trying to teach anyone anything they shouldn't already know, just shedding light on an old subject from a different perspective. Discuss the issue with valid arguments, don't attack me for showing you it.<br>
