The people capable of taking him down which is going to grow have no interest in the rest of the plane really.<br>
<br>
I think I can almost 100% say that to be able to do Cazic you need to be beyound  normal fear plane armor. So in the sense we have another Ragefire  scenario on our hand. Where someone lower lvl want something reservable that block of a mob that is pretty much fcfs.<br>
<br>
I know many say that the ones that book fear also have the rights to do CT, but right now its total bogus that someone who book fear have the rigth to choose which other guild should be allowed to zone in after and try and kill him. It leads to nothing but corruption and favourization.<br>
<br>
So reading through your FG post I came up with an idea that might work. What if we aply the same for CT, that every time he pops within 24 or 36 hours any guild that want to atempt him can do so, sadly also cleaning the armor mobs in the way.<br>
<br>
If no one is able to take him down within that time frame they will have to wait until after sheduled raids like now.<br>
<br>
Any raids that are ruined or  hurt by the CT atempters killings get to choose a free date between the normal 14 days and 21 days ahead.<br>
<br>
This would probably remove some guilds from the rotation both now and in the future. It would also benefit the guild hurt by the CT atempt that they can  pretty much choose any day of the week those 3 weeks ahead instead of having to camp another date. A little bonus for being stepped on.<br>
<br>
That way we  could secure that brell will be a server that doesnt let spawns go wasted by, but at the same time keep a reservation in place for those that need it.<br>

<br>
1) Make CT FFA only on repops that are know 24hr+ in advance(example, Patches with notice, and 7 day repop). If you do this, people will know ahead of time their raid could get stepped on. Making him FFA on a emergency outage would catch too many raiders by suprise and cause alot of upset people. If we limited it this way, raids would have an idea their raid is going to be stepped on, and can plan accordingly.<br>
<br>
2) Would also suggest that if a raid gets stepped on the Guild going in take atleast one group of stepped on raiders (if time factors work out) in to loot the armor mobs. If time factors dont work out, just make sure to take SOMEONE to loot the armor ..so it isnt wasted.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) raids stepped on should get a replacement date three weeks out. But they should be only able to choose the same day of the week +/- 1 day (as this could lead to exploiting, by signing up for a slow night (wed) and hoping you get stepped on so you can claim a busy night (Sat/Sun)<br>
so an example of my suggestion would look like this<br>
<br>
Wed raid gets stepped on = they pick date Tues,Wed,Thurs three weeks out<br>
<br>
Friday Raid gets stepped on = They pick date Thurs, Friday, Sat three weeks out <br>
Not sure on the logistics of this idea though ..the Moderators would have to deside how hard this woudl be to implement.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all looks like a start to a solution to the CT contention.  <p><center>Phazy Daayz 52st lvl Disciple<center><br><center> EXILE<center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urelbeekeinre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Relbeek Einre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>uncommonly Good <img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/goldstartr.gif align=middle></span><br>  Posts: 2946<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/9/01 8:24:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmm.</span><hr size=1> I don't see CT getting wasted much.

The amount of guilds who can actually take down CT i can probably count on one hand, and if you're interested in trying for CT, just ask the raiders nicely why not? I know the only reason why youre posting this is because youre on the same time as me and you dont want to wait for the raiders to get done. Yeah it bites, my fear raids start around 1-2am, but thats the way it is. Maybe try getting in touch with another guild who's on Europa time who also raids fear on occasions and work out an agreement with them? I see atleast a few alternatives instead of what youre proposing, which i think will only cause more damage... <p><table cellspacing=5 border=0>

What you want to do is toss the entire reservation system, and that is wrong.  What people are doing now is making arangements that work with people to take down mobs.  It is what I tried to do with you last week when I resereved Fear and you came in the next day and declared you were going to do, knowing full well that the plane was reserved before you.  You had no interest in the armor mobs, which my raid wanted, you were after the golems that had poped and CT.  I know you like to point out how the time zone situation can be difficult for you and ET.  The real fact of the matter is that you are impatient, and that you do not like waiting your turn.  The 2-3 guilds that do want to take down CT have Zero problem doing so now, infact when CT is up SR has contacted me and worked around my raids so they could take him down.  Not like you, who did not see my reservation or propose much in terms of helpful compromise between us.  I admit, our situation last week was grey, and I defer to that greyness.  But what you propose now is for the future, and I am adamantly opposed to it.<br>
<br>
Guilds and people that make an honest effort to take down CT, like SR, have no problem doing so now.  I  know this from first hand experience, they are kind and honestly try and work with people, specifically me.  You cannot be flexible, and this is harmfull to allof us.  You want a carte blanche to do whatever you like, when you like, without working things out inperson with the raiders scheduled directly.  You wnat this because it will force you to make concessions on your own plans, and because you fear you will miss out on killing mobs because SR or others will get there first.  This stinks.<br>
<br>
Our reservation system for the plains works perfectly fine, and those that want to make an hoenst effort to work with scheduled raiders to take out CT are doing so now.  Absolutely no changes are needed, unless it is to cover those who do not want to be bothered with the rest of the community.<br>

Lanos I appreicate you making a proposal but unlike the FG raids Fear is not a plane that the eeservation system is have great problems in and, as you said this will hurt some of the guilds on the rotations.  Right now there are very few guilds that even have and issue with the reservation system in place.  But you want to make it so more people have problems than the current status.<br>
<br>
Proposing a change is destined to make things easier and better for the server on a whole.  Not worse. <p><center>

Also, from different things I've seen there have been times when the stronger guild invites a few from the other raiders to help them take the god down.<br>
<br>
Thus the members of the smaller guilds learn, and get the experience (not exp, you know what type of Experience I'm talking about) of doing God raids (different than dragon raids? and planier? i don't know)<br>
<br>
So, when smaller guilds see the willingness of stronger guilds to help them, invite a few of their members, or they are just generally poliete about respecting the current raid, sure the smaller guild will invite the strong guild to follow behind them.<br>
<br>
It's got that &quot;you scratch my back&quot; feel, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Here's a question, it may seem stupid or &quot;newbie-ish&quot; to some of you, but honestly I'm asking.  Does it matter what TIME a MoB is killed?  (IE.  if raid starts at 5AM cst and is finished at 1PM CST) as long as the plane was reserved for that specfic raid does it matter what time the raid starts?<br>
<br>
I know there is a timer on the spawns, so I guess my real question is, how much would it screw up the re-pops for a raid to be held in non-prime time hours.<br>

<br>
At the time a normal raid is over, and its possible to get to CT, its 3 or 5am european time. Even in a weekend, most of the players in a european guild, is likely to be in their beds sleeping.<br>
<br>
Lanos´s idea sounds good to me, it complicates the plane reservations a bit, but its a good way of giving us european players a chance for a mob like Cazic.<br>
