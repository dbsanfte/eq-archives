Until my cleric hit 24, I had no problems with back up healers in the group.  When I received greater healing, the problem began.  Before I get into this, I see this issue from both sides as I stated above.  Since I am in this situation, I feel I am qualified to post this advice.  If you disagree, by all means, please say so.<br><br>Up until my cleric received greater heal, I never thought about throwing heals at bad times on my druid.  I just did it.  I have heals just like they do and I should be able to throw them whenever I see someone is 2 bulbs or below.  Once my cleric had g-heal I quickly saw the error of this mentality.  From 24-29, clerics outheal everyone hands down and greater heal at that leel range heals anywhere from 1.5 to 3 bulbs of life.  It was so annoying when a back-up healer would cast regular healing when someone dropped to 2 bulbs simply because I refused to cast g-heal until they hit half life to save mana by preventing overflow.  I tried to explain this to many a druid/sham I grouped with, but it never seemed to sink in.  They kept cutting off my heals or healing witihout announcing it causing one of us to WAY overheal doing the thing I detest the most, wasting mana. At 29, the alts do get g-heal but even then, clerics are better healers getting the 15% bonus making them more mana proficient.  <br><br>That's their job, let them do it.  Believe me, there are LOTS of things that especially druids can do that clerics cant.  Druids are an asset to the grop even if a cleric is present.  Snaring, nukes, sow, strength buffs, etc all make a druid a valid team player.  My advice is do not cast heals if you're grouped with a cleric UNLESS someone sinks below 2 bulbs of life.  In those cases, it is perfectly acceptable.  If the cleric yells LOM, then is another time to announce that you will do the heals until they regain some mana.  Remember, the prime objective is to keep the group running smoothly.  When I'm playing my druid and I'm grouped with a cleric, I immediately yield the heals to him/her and send them a /tell asking them to let me know when they are LOM and I will step in until they are ready to go.<br><br>Post 34, clerics are masters of healing. Superior Heal does 600+ recovery for them.  Something back up healers won't see for a long time.  Again, please don't think I'm ranting or gung-ho clerics rule and the backups should know their place.  I'm just saying use your skills as a druid (addressing druids primarily since I'm posting on our board) and let clerics use theirs.  The group will be much better that way.<br><br>I realize my experience is limited to that of an early 30s druid and cleric so if any of you elders out there disagree with what I'm saying, I'd be glad to hear your side of it.<br><br>Thanks for reading my long post! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukralec.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kralec</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/01 8:38:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping with clerics</span><hr size=1> Id rather &quot;suffer&quot; through a couple hundred of wasted healing points, than to have that enchanter or heck, any other class, get killed.

I used to not understand this, either. All it really took was some time on the other side to see their (now my) point:<br><br>The way I think about healing responsibility is this: the tanks are my respsonsibility, the casters (including me and themselves) are the back up healer's responsibility, and the enchanter is EVERYONE'S responsibility. In my opinion, NO heal on an enchanter is wasted mana. Heck, I have cast cel heal on an ench at full health, just in case the mob aggroed them. <br><br>When a back up healer starts healing the tanks at 2 bubbles (usually right after I announced I am casting complete heal), and my usually efficient CH at 1 bub becomes inefficient at 3 bubs, yes, I get irritated. The fact is, it makes me feel like you don't trust me to heal properly. This would be the equivalent of me telling you to snare on every single mob, as if I didn't trust you to do your job. See, that's the way you have to look at it. When you heal a tank with a cleric in the group, you are basically telling that cleric that they suck as a healer, and YOU are going to make sure the tanks don't die. Healing casters? Sure, like I said, I think that's the back up helaer's normal job. Healing enchanters? Heck yea, the enchanter should always be at full hitpoints, because they WILL get aggroed, and their AC and hitpoints suck. But really, healing a 55+ tank with chloroblast is like the cleric trying to keep them alive with remedy. It just doesn't work.

As a matter of fact when I'm playing the cleric I make special allowances for a chanter like changing my &quot;on me&quot; hotkey to  please mez %t so the tanks can stay on their mobs preventing them from agroing on the chanter.<br><br>I think my original point got missed somewhere so let me give an example.  When I first got g-heal at 24, I had this happen time and time again, not just once in a while, and it didn't just waste the alts mana, it wasts the clerics:<br><br>The meleer is down to half life, I stand to throw a greater heal, and automaticly the b/u healer throws one right before mine brining the person to 2-2.5 bulbs of mana.  That happened constantly.  Communication or no communication.  I have hot keys that says &quot;incoming heal on %t&quot; but it didn't do any good.<br><br>My point is not to flame druids, I'm not doing that at all, my main is a druid, my point is that there is a whole other outlook here.  Yes clerics are touchy about mana because their mana is almost always on the low end and unlike the druid/shammy who are proficient at other things, the cleric has to med almost constantly for heals heals heals!  Of course I would want that mana to be well spent.  Not saying that wasted mana doesn't happen, just saying that it shouldn't happen alot.<br><br>The earlier poster was 100% right about complete heal.  It's a whole lot more efficient to use c-heal at 1bulb (tank/half-breed) than it is to use it at 3.  Instead the cleric could be using a much less costly heal to top the person off.<br><br>Healing is a clerics life.  If someone dies because I'm oom as a cleric, I take that as my responsibility and wonder how I could have *saved* mana to prevent this from happening.  This isn't a huge deal at lower levels (up until lv 20ish) because clerics are a bit underpowered anyway but when they start getting the big heals, it matters a great deal.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=shaladarra>Shaladarra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/01 9:50:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Grouping with clerics</span><hr size=1> ...and yes, it is an issue of trust as stated earlier.

If things go really bad (chanter gets killed and we have two mobs or more to deal with) Cleric deals with Main Tank and I deal with Secondary Tank.<br><br>As the mobs tend to hit a lot at higher levels and the damage shield on the tanks counts as damage done by them and not me, then a heal at half health, even if the tank is on a different mob, will not cause aggro. An early heal will aggro you, and trying to heal another while seeing your health drop about 1 bub of health with each attack is not a nice sight, and quite hard to do regardless of your Channeling skill. You gotta stay alive to keep others alive. If someone has to die that is the tank, because if any of the casters die, especially the healing ones, rest assured the tank or tanks won't last long if the situation has caused both healers to bite the dust. It is also true that without a tank the casters are also as good as dead.<br><br>4. Should both the Cleric and myself cast a heal at the same time and on the same player, &quot;I&quot; duck. My heal is less mana efficient, therefore I should save it up. Normally this occurs when either you think the Cleric has gotten distracted or both tanks are losing health. Getting clear who will interrupt the heal saves both from ducking and letting the tank snuff it.<br><br>Other assorted tasks:<br>Even if the mob does not run, SNARE IT!<br>I was in Siren's Grotto the other day, for my first time, and someone in my group said nothing ran. I had snare up, but I didn't cast. We got trained with a couple Sirens. We dealt with them, until one began running. I was healing at the time so couldn't snare in time. Needless to say she escaped and brought a few friends with her. I felt guilty because I should have snared, but I was told nothing ran. Then I was told they never hunted sirens... So, just in case, Snare it... The hunt went horribly from then on, and trying to get back to our initial spot was almost impossible.<br>DS is a must, Skin for yourself only (If Cleric is handing out Symbol), SoW, Str (if no shammy in group), and then your fav debuff or nukes. Pack Chloro also.<br><br>Clerics and Druids and Shammans should learn to work together, because they can heal, and that is one of the most important line of spells in the game.<br><br>Ciao for now!<br><br>Araxx - 52 Wanderer<br>Bristlebane<br>Did you die?<br>No, I'm a Druid, I don't die, I just get chased a lot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unidosplainswalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nidos Plainswalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 7:28:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping with clerics</span><hr size=1> When it comes to something like this, I think some people can get a little serious about things that... don't really matter too much.  A lot of people are concerned about being 100% efficient all of the time (I'm like this half the time).  This pertains mana usage, pulling, group makeup, etc.  Now, Verant gave Druids and Shaman healing spells for a reason and I don't see any reason not to use them; even with a cleric in the group.  It doesn't really interfere with you directly and it certainly isn't killing the group.  As I see it, as long as you're having fun/not dying, it's all good.  <br><br>I heal while I group with my cleric bud (he's 51, I'm 47) and I know he can do it better, but I never thought I might be insulting him.  I heal my party if I feel afraid that they might die, not because I'm nervous he won't do a good job of healing.  Of course, I can't see into the head of every druid or cleric and know what they're thinking, I can only give my personal opinion.<br><br>The point as I see it is to have fun, not maximize or min/max everything you can, and that's what I try to achieve.<br><br>Nidos Plainswalker <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukayleigh88.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kayleigh88</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 9:33:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://communities.msn.ca/_Secure/0MAAAAAQRZJwobQ10JEgBEVnTf2fwE2ks75hF4L27KUCO9em3zq3LL6!q8Jf7rFgS2dffE3vlh*IEAAAAWBMRAw/kayleigh.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grouping with clerics</span><hr size=1> &quot;The point as I see it is to have fun, not maximize or min/max everything you can, and that's what I try to achieve.&quot;<br><br>Well said. Have fun and do not worry about mana efficiency too much.<br><br>Let me throw this example out. I sometimes heal the enchanter on full health. Usually this is on a pull and when mez gets resisted. The reason is that heals are a taunt as well and it helps the enchanter out by quickly getting the mobs off their back and allowing them to quickly get control of the situation. Mana efficient heal? definately not.
