She was laying on a cold, hard rounded surface that had more lumps than a typical mattress in a second rate inn.  She rose carefully feeling the traces of the residual magics burning through her.  Throwing herself into a healing trance and magic annulment pattern without even thinking about it.  Taking a breath and calming her heart she donned a mask of calm as she opened her violet eyes.  Looking around she realized she was no where she had ever been before.  Her body had been lying on a rock that had been flattened inexpertly, in the back of her mind she realized that it looked like a make shift altar.  Quickly she moved off it, but fell to her knees weak with even that little exertion.  <br>
<br>
As she knelt there she felt the ground, it was perfectly smooth almost like the surface of the coveted black marble found in Vellious.  In her mind she registered that she was somewhere that was man made, not a place in nature.  Looking up slowly, her mind swirling with color and thought, she looked around more carefully.  Panic struck her as strongly as and blade had ever done, she could not remember how she came to be here.  She stood, pushing the weakness to a raw corner of her being and reacted like a wild animal, she ran.<br>
<br>
Her flight was erratic and stumbling, but she ran anyway.  Her mind circled around the irrational; she could remember nothing but her name and what was in the core of her being, music.  Instinct was all she had left as she tripped over silken skirts tearing at them when they tangled around her legs.  Running burned her lungs but she had gone but 30 feet when her small body collide with an invisible barrier.  Thrown to the ground again her eyes widened looking like an animal seeing its death before them.  Struggling up she bolted off in another direction only to cross about 60 feet when she again met with binding force.<br>
<br>
They say that man is no more than a civilized animal and when you strip the civilization away only the animal resides and his point was proved in this short time.  Kestri used all her energy moving back and forth looking for a weakness around her, throwing herself against the shield time and time again.  Hitting point after point bruising her body and adding to the exhaustion that had been pushed away.  <br>
<br>
Finally her reserves left her and she lay face down in the last place that had felt the punishment of her frail form.  Panic stilled for a moment her mind took over.  Coldly analyzing and shutting away the fear and pain she felt to the core of her being. Her body was sore, but had not been abused by anything but her own actions, the residual magic that had settled over her was cleared and all that was left was the greasy feel that it had touched her.  The place she was in still puzzled her though, calmly she rose to a sitting position resting her back against the barrier.  <br>
<br>
That’s when she felt it, the wall was not flat it curved behind her.  She was trapped in a sphere of something.  Closing her eyes she felt out touching the barrier, magical energy was there but the wall was not magical itself, just touched by it.  Her deductive thoughts slowly brought more of her self back.  Sighing, she smiled a little, remembering more and more of herself and her past.  This gave her the base to build upon to solve this delicate puzzle, no longer a passionate slave to her panic.  <br>
<br>
The calm coldness inside herself touched on something about the area outside her.  There was nothing moving here, not even the air.  Looking up she took in more of her surroundings.  There was nothing in here alive but herself, no insects, no animals.  She was completely alone.  She had never spent time alone before. She knew that in her being.  As a bard her life had always been with others, her music was for her own love, but it never sounded more lovely than when she shared it with others.  Panic rose in her throat again, and she physically swallowed.<br>
<br>
Standing, she hummed a song to help steady herself and heal the pains.  “My Goddess, what has happened?”  And that is when she looked up and saw it; the sky changed becoming filled with something.  A lurching sent her again to her knees and a sound reverberated causing her to clutch her ears.  She blacked out from the suddenness of it all and when she came to there was someone with her.<br>
<br>
He was tall and genteel, an aura of power surround him.  “Well my songbird, I hope you find you cage suitable.”  His deep voice struck terror deep in her soul.  <br>
<br>
“You,” her voice barely carried past her own lips, “you did this to me?”<br>
<br>
He moved over to her, crouching down next to her, looking more predatory with every move.  When he paused she felt like she was being stalked by a lion in the Karanas.  “I had to.  Had it been my choice there were other ways to take you.  But I have constraints on what must happen to you.  I normally never work under orders like these, but I am being paid well.  I have promised that your mind and your body must remain in one piece.  You have made a very dangerous enemy my beauty.”<br>
<br>
She shrunk from him, feeling his gave over her. Looking from her head to her feet she knew he drank it all in and enjoyed it.  The torn skirts that showed her white skin, the slight flush to her cheeks, her eyes wide with reaction, the gleam on her body from the exertion she had engaged in.  Suddenly all the nerves in her body came alive, they sang in response to his gaze.  She could not believe that her body would betray her in such a base way.  <br>
<br>
He stretched out a silk gloved hand and touched her cheek lightly and her beat faster. His hand dropped to where her shoulder had become exposed and her smiled.  “I can see why he wants to possess you; there are few things in this realm that are like you.  And I have seen them, and held them all.  That is why he called on me to get you for him.  You see I am a Master in these things.  But do not worry my rare one; you shall not suffer damage while in my hands.” He smiled to himself in personal amusement.    “I will take great care with you; you are more dangerous than you know.”<br>
<br>
He stood, gestured and was gone, but once again Kes felt the world move beneath her and looked up to see the sky and she realized it was he who held her cage, right in the palm of his hand.<br>
