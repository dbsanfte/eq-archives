<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Use the original ToK mana/duration/recast spell but only silence spells that have a casting time &gt; 1 sec. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This will let all AoE spells and procs through that have sub-second, but prevent gate and complete heals that have 1 second +  cast times. <br>
<br>
Have the original mana use, duraction of the spell and recast timers. Leave the level where it was. <br>
<br>
The coding is easy to implement server side without having to evaluate all mob's spells. Separating AoE spells and procs from the regular spells is way too much work.<br>
<br>
What do you all think about that?<br>

kind of like how er what spell was it that clerics get that now leaves a buff icon called complete heal or something like that after casting? so that they can't constantly recast? think it was the spell that was on the pog cleric bp before mark of karn was added to it. <p><font size=2> <i> Dueval Olivas, <br>

Actually, the method I had was a bit simplier.<br>
<br>
I figured AoE Roars and Breath attacks were a 0 mana spell with a reset timer.   Much like Death Touches and other insane abilities.<br>
<br>
My submission to Verant was:<br>
<br>
ToK sticks<br>
Mob Mana = (-1) * Mob Mana<br>
If mob tries to cast a 0 mana spell, no mana check required.<br>
<br>
At the end of the spell<br>
Mob Mana = (-1) * Mob Mana<br>
<br>
So, all zero mana spells can be cast, and nearly no extra coding is required for the spell.<br>

ToK checks at MR+15, if you increase it to MR+40 or MR+50, its chances of landing would greatly decrease even when the mob is tishaned, malo'd, and occlusion'd.  If the chance of the spell sticking is about 30% with full debuffs, then 3 paladins (normal for a raid) casting the spell simultaneously can stop a CH or gate, but there would be no way to complete the cycle to block AEs.<br>

By that I maen, how could verant arrange it so that spells under 1 sec in casting time do not get silenced?  By adding a channeling  check at 1sec and making <br>

Ooooooh.<br>

Why not have Thunder of Karana have the effect of reducing a mobs channeling skill by 95% or so?  Now that there are items that can affect skills, that should be feasible...<br>
<br>
ToK = -90% channeling<br>
<br>
No longer guaranteed to silence (satisfying verant), but still chainable and possibly (probably?) extremely useful. <p>Aragir Lancot<BR>

<br>
Currently they already must have a flag and a timer for silencing a mob since ToK worked for a little. Just modify the coding to look at the spell that is planned to cast and only let the spell through if the cast timer is less than 1 second.<br>
<br>
VI implemented all procs, AoEs, item effects as spells now, so a small change in the spell engine is all that is required.<br>
<br>
The channeling idea sounds also promising, just needed some testing so that 20+ meeles seldom interrupt AoEs or procs. (See the reports of our undead proc being interrupted)<br>

<br>
After a bad nights sleeping on this and tossing and turning (didn't bother anyone, except the tossing that is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Well, no actually I slept well, but I was thinking a bit about this.<br>
<br>
I think keeping it to the mana spells only might be an option, but it is last resort for me for reason I point out elsewhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
How about:<br>
<br>
Thunder of Karana<br>
<br>
4 seconds of silence (inc AoEs)<br>
10 seconds of mana=0<br>
8 seconds of 100% MR <br>
Cannot be Dispelled<br>
At the end of 10 secs the mana is restored<br>
Mana cost - 100-200<br>
Recast - 5min<br>
Resist Rate - 50%<br>
(Side Effect - Reduce caster's HPs by 50%)<br>
<br>
Now note this is all dependent upon AoEs being purely random procs - that is the dragon has no control over WHEN they will go off.  The 5 second complete silence will mean that this has a chance of stopping AoEs, but the 8 sec 100% MR will mean that another ToK could not be landed, so the dragon would have 4 secs to get a chance of procing an AoE.  <br>
<br>
The effect of not being dispellable is obvious, and it is already coded for non-dispellable spells in the game so should not be a big hurdle.  The 10 seconds of mana=0 will ensure that the main effect of the spell is the kept - to stop mobs from gating/Chealing yet because of the small period of 'Complete silence' it still has SOME use against AoEs for those encounters where mob mana does not play a big part in the raids.<br>
<br>
The 8sec 100% MR would allow the second Paladin to cast this spell so as to land after the 8secs of 100%MR are up, but not before.  Alternatively a higher resist rate may be just as effective.  This would still allow the chain silencing of mana using spells, and have a chance to stop procs, yet not completely.<br>
<br>
5min recast should be fine I think, mana cost does not NEED to be too high because of the long duration, but I would not be against 200 mana cost because I think it creates a more hesitant to use unless needed mentality on top of the recast time.  Resist rate should be at least 25%, but I think 50% is not too high, obviously this will be different for different mobs.  The reduce casting Paladin's HPs by 50% is a bit of something thrown in to make it even more of a 'end of fight' thing, as well as from a RP thingy (I mean we are channeling thunder that can silence dragons here, has got to do something to us <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  But I don't think it may be necessary.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let me know what you think, and bash it, praise it, point out the problems etc.  Remember, this will only work if AoEs are random procs, if the mob can control when they cast them, then it is useless.  So I would be interested to know what is the case with AoEs.<br>

<br>
Making the effect lower current mana to 0? Ok but it would be a harder to code as once it's over does it just reset to max mana? Do you now need a place to store the old value to reset it?<br>
<br>
I think a better idea would just to put in a spell that can stop the spell CH from being cast. Cool ability? yes. Sorta like the wizard translocational anchor.<br>
<br>
Or... add in a low mark of karn spell for paladins, neat effect, not exactly uber but it'd be something cool we could do.<br>

Assuming AoEs are random procs, and they on average go off what, how many times a fight?  So with 8 Paladins on a 15 min fight could at max keep the AoE silence in place 120 secs, or two minutes of that fight.  And you think that is overpowerful?  This is not including resists, and even if the two mins is too long then just increase the recast time to say 15min.  At that even 24 Paladins couldn't keep a mob AoE silenced for over two minutes.  <br>
<br>
What my idea essentially makes ToK IS a spell that is really only effective against mana using spells, but still has that small chance of stopping AoEs without taking this ability away from the mob to an significant degree.  As for the zero mana idea that is only a suggestion, I don't care how they make it stop mana using spells - but if they can stop spells like Cheal and gate being cast surely they can stop all mana using spells?<br>
<br>
Added with fact that you say have the set HPs to 50% for the caster effect as well, then it would mean many Paladins would be hesitant to use this towards the start of a fight.<br>

How about an AoE silence.  Works on PC's as well? ....wait nm that wouldn't work.  The whole PvP thing. I don't know what to do, but I know Verant needs to fix this. <p><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/dc/bdouble013/images/goreandhak.gif><br><br><html><left><a

So I don't think it should be too overpowering in these encounters.  <br>
<br>
Yeah Bdouble, I was thinking of just high end fights that last for excessive amounts of time and forgetting about the fights that only last a couple of mins anyway or less.  <br>

Noone is saying anything about a 2 minute silence.. We're talking same duration/recast/mana/Cast.. Just make it so it only silences spells with a casting time greater then 1 second.. ie, AE's, breaths and procs will still be cast.. sev will still stun, gore will still slow &amp; fear.  And i'm fairly sure that if it is (or turns out to be) unbalanced in PvP, they can change it.. They changed it so fear has no effect.. why not silence? I dont see how it can imbalance pvp though. 6 second silence imho is less worse then a 10 second stun *grin* But thats from a blue server player of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utaliewin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taliewin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/12/01 3:07:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> As Senchy pointed out the strength of this spell is the fact of its chain - castability.  If that were not so the mob could just pull the spell off as soon as the silence ended.  Same in PvP (though I suppose you could argue that there is a greater reaction time for PCs) - unless it is going to keep a caster silenced for some significant time it will be practically useless, especially if it has a reasonable recast time.  As you say Dalz, a stun would be more efficient. <br>

Yea I like the idea of having it work on spells with a casting time of greater than 1.  Maybe then they will give me a heal that has a casting time greater than 1 ;).  I might have misinterpreted it as a longer time not a between refresh rates for us and now only being to silence a mob for 2 min.  I think it would work like that if it only affected spells with the casting time less than 1.  Either way you are not going to have enough pallies on a raid to chain cast it like you would a CH cycle so its kind of a mute point. <p><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/dc/bdouble013/images/goreandhak.gif><br><br><html><left><a
