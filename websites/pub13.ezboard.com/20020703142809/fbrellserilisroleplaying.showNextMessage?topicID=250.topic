Crusher easily let his dark blade fall on the shoulders of a lizardman sentinel while Cerric stood briefly to heal the wounds the lizardman had incurred. The towering troll ducked back under the door leading to the maze to find another lizard to quench his thirst for blood, and Starseed sat to rest. Lorely sang a sweet song of healing that had always kept the adventurers going while her love, Raveiz, sat quietly looking for natural inspiration from the few trees of the temple. The two elves of the forest were most in love and Raveiz was always the leader of the group. His leadership had brought them all together as close friends. Even though that was the case, before Crusher had met these great people he had fought with two incredibly talented wizards in the Oasis of Marr, not to mention a wizard named Alderon he had battled giant tarrantulas with in the northern desert of Ro.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The wizards, Yndo and Jiyu, told Crusher of how they planned to create the later great guild named Enclave. Although Yndo said the guild would be for the ones talented in the greater powers of magic, he told Crusher with a wink that they would need some trolls to watch over them. Even though Crusher was most anxious to stay and adventure further with these wizards he was forced to leave the world of Norrath for a period of two weeks. The night of his return he met the great people who he now ventured in the lost temple with.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crusher was the only member of Enclave in his usual group, but he always stayed loyal to his good friends. &quot;Incoming!&quot; Crusher told the group. Starseed stood tall, another of the few powerful troll shadowknights that existed in the world at this time. Lalan, a great erudite wizard, stood to prepare his spell on the evil they prepared to fight. The mob fell quickly to the two large blades of the trolls and the swords of the bard. Meanwhile on the other side of the courtyard, Ganon, another member of the Enclave brought his bladed claw across the chest of a weak lizard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ganon was a sight to see in his set of rubicite armor as he nimbly toyed with the lizards along with a few other members of the Enclave. Alderon also played with the lizards, taking them out with his powerful spells. They all waited as the rest of the guild gathered at the Temple. This would be the night that they battled the Avatar of Fear, the most feared denizen of Cazic-Thule on the plane of Norrath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;See you guys later, gonna go help out the guild.&quot; Crush told his friends. After a few good-byes he joined his comrades and they started moving towards the lair of the AoF. The two groups of the guild easily wiped out the lair and almost cleared the sewers. It was a triumphant night for all and was great fun. <br>
Later on, the guild acquired many other great adventurers, it's much too hard to list them since these events took place during the beginning of the world of Brell Serilis. But Enclave was most powerful. While most of the guild was reaching level 50 Crusher was still near 40. His vacation long ago had still set him back pretty far. Things started to go on in the other world that Crusher lived in and he could no longer seek greatness and adventure with his great friends. Raveiz had started a new guild with Lorely, Cerric, and Starseed and they had all slowly grown apart from Crusher. Crush decided to leave Enclave with some others as he left this world of Norrath, and Yndo disbanded Enclave at this time as he watched some of his friends leave the guild and the legacy of Enclave dwindled.<br>
Some members became angry with Yndo, and there were many heated discussions about him disbanding the guild. Even though the guild broke up, a large group of the original members knew that what they had was too great to just give up. So, they had all gotten together and discussed the creation of a new guild. One that would always be great and powerful. They named this guild Silent Redemption, and Ganon was dubbed the leader. <br>
Since then most of Crusher's good friends have left Norrath and Cerric tells of how Lorely and Raveiz now have a child together. Since Crusher left for good his brother decided that he would live on the life of his sibling, and thus entered Norrath under the identity of Crusher. Now the original Crusher has returned to Norrath, as a certain dwarven cleric named Ruffles, now re-named Dozy...<br>

Hehe was in the mood to write something and I came up with this. Thanks for taking the time to read it. If anyone knows any of the people in the story please have them take a look at this, I especially would like to hear from Lorely and Raveiz if there is anyone that can get a hold of them.<br>
