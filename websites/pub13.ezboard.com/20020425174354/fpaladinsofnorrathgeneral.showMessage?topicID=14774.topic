Defensive -vs- Undead, though, is acceptable. Our role is to abolish the evil of the world, the undead. This makes sense. What could we tank with it? Venril Sathir, Zlandicar(?) and Ssrae temple. That's all I can think of off the top of my head. It would be identical to the Warrior Discipline, except that it would *only* work on undead. That's not unbalancing at all, and, I believe, something that would add to the definition of our class. This is our job, let us do it. Could a warrior still Defensive-vs-undead? Yes. But, we should be more efficient at it than they would be. Perhaps make it the Warrior's Defensive, and add atop that the Undead only Damage Shield we've discussed here for added aggro/damage? A 15 point damage shield that stacks with all other Damage Shields.<br><br>How about making Act of Valor *useful* in this respect: A targetable save, like a Cleric's Death Pact. When the target runs out of hit points, there's a 30% chance that Lay of Hands will go off on them. It, of course, won't stack with the Cleric's Death Pact, but would give the cleric enough time to get their CHeal off. You may or may not agree with me on this part, but, even if we do ave Complete Heal lay of Hands, I don't think it should be a Complete Heal. That, I think, is asking too much. This would be a momentary solution that gives the target a little added time alive, and, we lose the amount of hit points that our LoH healed for. That, in my opinion, is a useful Act of Valor. It puts us in peril and does something valorous. Could this kill us? Definately. AoEing MoBs will sap HPs, and if we're already low when this goes off, we're dead. It can heal for more than the HPs we have, but, that is our instant death. That is an Act of Valor I'd spend my AA points on.<br><br>And, while this is more for shits and giggles, I also like the idea of a questable level 60 spell that's different depending on the deity you worship. I worship Marr, so I'd like to a spell along the lines of Fury of the Lightbringer, a new extended-Yaulp and HoT. What would you like your deity's spell to be?<br><br>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br><br>I'm posting this here for discussion. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This is nothing more than wishful thinking,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and shouldn't be taken as something VI *should* do for us because we deserve it. Frankly, we don't. Nobody deserves to get any one thing to make them better than another class. And, after talking with several warriors in my guild, I don't think we should get a full-fledged Defensive like theirs at all, but the one I've posted is acceptable and leaves both classes well-defined. Like it or not, that is their class-defining ability and, if you think about it ... we can outtaunt any classes, so if we had Defensive, as many people have already said, Warriors would become obsolete.<br><br>I'm not posting this here for flames. If you post a flame, I won't reply and will probably label you an idiot that can't read.

Warriors where aggro was easier to maintain or where hp/ac made the slim differance.  Paladins on mobs who are hardest to maintain aggro.  In most cases thou I believe the task would fal more to who was a better eq player or had a better trust issue with their guild.   <br><br>Am I asking for that?  No<br>What will I always seek? <br>A defense styl ability that allows the paladin to live 85% as long as a similiar warrior would. I think the 15% is enough to defer to warrios on some mobs yet high enough to defer to paladins on others.  To be honest It'd boil right down to a dead heat imho.<br><br>Would I implement such a change on all servers?  Not until I gradualy tested it with established guilds on a very few servers.  Personaly I'd like verant to make a new test srver something like this.<br><br>Verant makes identical copy of all toons from uber guild 001 and then clones them onto a test server.  Then allow that guild to log on the special test server and test it.  Simply posting the guild's name on the eq board would be enough of a drive.  Of corse this special treatment/server would only be used to test such potentialy game balance issues.  <br><br>But hey I'm a dreamer  oh woops forgot their legend servers are test servers woops <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uketherami.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kether Am I</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 523<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/02 3:06:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> If you give paladin any sort of defensive style discipline of note I would then offer the following changes to 'balance' them:<br><br>Remove CC<br>Remove HWoP<br><br>Otherwise I honestly wouldn't see why warriors wouldn't just make pal/sks to tank because of their otherwise massive benefits in versatility or rng/mnk/rog for damage output.<br><br>Warriors TANK.<br><br>Leave them that.<br><br>There are a myriad of ways a paladin is more useful not tanking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucylria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cylria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/9/02 4:10:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> Why leave warriors as the only tanks?

In traditional fantasy, warriors were not just thought of as tanks - they were damage dealers. They COULD be tanks but were primarily noted for their weaponskills. On the other hand, a Paladin or Knight was nearly always thought of as a tank. They were like the ultimate defensive class.<br><br>Warriors should be more like monks with a variety of different fighting styles. Monks should be less into fighting styles and more into chants/prayers/remedies (new trade skill? akin to alchemy), as well as their FD etc. Paladins/SKs should be main tanks, with limited casting ability within their particular specialty (healing/undead, lifetaps). <br><br>Of course, EQ1 will never see the classes go under any dramatic change. But as someone pointed out, giving Paladins defensive, especially if it were a little more limited than a warriors, shouldn't hurt game balance, and for those that don't want to MT, simply don't use it. <br><br>I think I would probably like Paladins to get a 'no-damage' defensive. This means for the duration of the disc they cannot auto-attack (they can still cast spells). They must also be using a shield. Call it defend. It would draw high agro to start with and then the agro would slowly be diminished. Purpose? To gain immediate agro to oneself in the event of the mob agroing rogues/monks/rangers/casters and thus allowing the MT to then take over. <br><br> <p><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/taliewin/TaliewinLifesworde.gif" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umadronedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MadroneDorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/02 1:36:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> Monks arnt the only FD pullers,<br>SKs and even Necros can FD pull<br><br> <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50583">Madrone</a> ~ Dorfen Crusader<br>Winter's Light ~ Drinal</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/02 2:25:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> [/quote]And, while this is more for shits and giggles[/quote]<br><br>first off, why the heck doesn't her/his posts get edited for cussing and mine does? /boggle<br><br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm posting this here for discussion.

Some of the uber raid paladins think its a very useful situational skill, some of the causal players like it for the RP and raw power it has.  But most people here seem to dislike this skill, and I admit I'm one of them.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Note I'm probably wrong here, I admit that, but this is just MY thoughts and opinion on the situation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>I've been just wondering about that disparity, why many people value it yet others dislike it so much, when its really a very basic idea.  The best I can up with is looking at the way we look at dieing, and at our char's in Norrath.  The people that value it seem to mostly look at it as &quot;push this button to heal %T for my current HP, and kill me&quot; - just that, nothing more.  A tool, another little skill in our bag of tricks.  Probably one of the more rare tools, just like that unique screwdriver head for those rare obscure specialty screws, but extremely useful at the right moment.<br><br>So why do so many of us dislike the current incarnation of the skill? I'd say there are two overall reasons, the first being the most important - its name.  It is called &quot;Act of Valor&quot;, implying a lot of things, especially to the more RP slanting paladin. Its current effect isn't Valorous, but when I look at people's suggestions for how to improve AoV ... they just don't work for a player skill.  Sure, killing myself to CH 6 people would be a wonderful valorous act, and I would love the ability - for the casual gamer or the light raider that could be a great thing to do on those rare occasions at just the right time.  But you have to look at what those abilities could be used to do - if you brought a bunch of paladins to a raid, all with AoV primed and ready to eat through xp, think of how much healing power you could have - with AoE heals, or group LoH's or CH's, or any of these other things, they all seem to have incredibly balance repercussions - to us /they/ might be worth a death, but to a die hard raider (from what I gather) that's a ton of gain for little cost.  I think that's why AoV is like it is now - its balanced for the uber hard core raid, the place where something like this could most be abused.  Again, not a commonly used tool, but just one for were it counts, something to add in to list of LoH, HWoP/WoH, DA, BMB/DS, /disc sanctification, etc.<br><br>I guess my point is this: that for the many of us that don't like AoV, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it wasn't made for us</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br><br>And as to the original poster's AoV idea - I rather like it, but I don't like these &quot;percent chance on death things&quot; - I much prefer certainty.  Those cleric death pact spells never seem to work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Wow, I got rambly ... sorry<br>Dunthor <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubasaldholyblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Basald Holyblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 804<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/10/02 12:03:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> we can't have it all.<br><br>some people say we should be the MT's and while I would love that, its not our job.

SoL has been a great thing for bringing paladins back to groups.  As for not MTing? kunark we weren't MT's and we had a B*tch of a time getting groups.<br><br>Warriors = Great tank with aggro problems and very good damage<br><br>Paladins = Tank with no aggro problem and low end damage.<br><br>As for our damage being more then what warriors would like? <br>Well here's a few things warriors have asked for and some they still ask for.<br>Best tank in game by far.<br>Highest melee damage in game<br>AoE taunting<br>Best taunt in game<br>Able to bandage to full health<br>More items that cast spells<br><br>hhmmm that doesn't/didn't tread on others toes?<br><br>Being MT on uber raids isn't something every warrior does but only  the highest/best in the guilds.  Like I've said I don't want them unused here just to have pal/sk included here.<br><br>I've suggested that a Def Disc for sk/pal should be restricted to 59/60 lvl players and only be used on named mobs 63+  This keeps pal/sk from invadeing on warriors group desireability.<br><br>I've suggested pal/sk Def Disc be 15% weaker then warriors.  When you combined a 15% less discipline with a small hp and less ac you maintain a large margin between the sk/pal and the warrior.     <br><br>This would imho restore pal/sk to equal yet different tanks with warriors.  <br><br>/boggle<br><br><br>As for people who don't like being 1 of the 3 tank classes and rather do the duties a 40th lvl cleric could do.   Make a 40th lvl cleric.<br><br>The reason people invite a pal/sk to groups today is to fill the tank roll.  If they still need a warrior then you're not doing your job.   <br>There are 6 group slots<br>There are 15 classes<br><br>That means classes need to overlap and do each others jobs or else we'll have 6 classes in groups and 9 others as mules.<br><br><br>There is only one MA in a group.  The paladin trades off doing more damage for retaining aggro better then a warrior.  This allows clerics to consentrate more on the MA for others will be hit less.  It allows spell casters to cast more safely and allows those who do damage to do it more with out fear of being unable to lose aggro if they recieve it.<br><br>Currently the game in exp area is balanced.  Now for the 1% of the players who are MT on the most uber mobs I ask VI to increase the classes that can do it to eflect the balance of the game.   <br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udrachan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drachan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/11/02 8:38:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14774.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Realistic Paladin Defensive and a possible fix for AoV.</span><hr size=1> I cannot get away from the impression that all these posts are just an expression of the general frustration some of us, including myself have experienced in game.<br><br>How often do you get called for groups when you have LFG flagged? Well I know for certain from talking to others that &quot;basic classes&quot; like warrior, rogue, chanter, cleric or monk will regularly get tells to come join here or there, while I have yet to recevie one call.<br><br>For someone who likes to group, like myself, this is very frustrating. In the end it does result in lots of idle time time, wasted time, and time is scarce.<br><br>Also, you will not be called to tougher one group camps where people want only the warrior, rogue, cleric, monk and enchanter, that is a fact experience every day. We are second choice on all groups' wish lists, that is the truth on my server, and there are many experienced players on this. Maybe one or the other will arue differently, but then be happy, you are living in wonderland.<br><br>Try to form group yourself is one solution, but that is not always possible either, as camps may be taken and no partner available.<br><br>In the end, also a fact, you earn your Xps slower than those favored classes too.<br><br>Of course there may be other classes that also have similar problems and prejudice.<br><br>I would also think that Luclin, with tougher mobs hitting harder and with more AC and HP only stengthens the tendency to fall back to the primal group WAR, ROG, CLR, ENC... Sadly.<br><br>I enjoy playing a paladin, it is just sad that the game design does not allow enough variety to allow us to have great skills.<br><br>Our LoH pales to the cleric's CH plenty, and if would trade my LoH for the CH spell, even if cost me 500 mana. In most situations the LoH I cast ot save a raid only makes it last 20 seconds longer. I find myself running for equipment just to increase my usefuleness, and I blame game design that keeps strengthening the habit of the &quot;basic&quot; group set-up.

When there really isn't anything particularly lacking. We have some things that are broken or have become redundant due to aa skills or what have you.
