She was orphaned at a very young age. Her adopted sister Meana tells a story of her parents finding Frooggee in a tiny basket along the shores of Qeynos. Meana's parents took Frooggee into their home and adopted her as their own. They were worried when Frooggee never grew tall like themselves, but she always seemed healthy. <br>
<br>
Meana and Frooggee became best of friends, they did everything together. Often Frooggee felt restless and knew she was very different. She loved her parents and her sister, but she was so different than than her adopted family. It never really bothered Frooggee that she was tiny compared to her family and villagers, but knew there was something very different about herself.<br>
<br>
Frooggee became restless and started studying the unliving. She spent much time hiding in the sewers of Qeynos learning all she could about the undead. It was pretty obvious to her sister Meana that Frooggee could be headed for trouble. Not wanting her sister to venture into the world alone, Meana began to train in the ways of the Monk. <br>
<br>
Frooggee quickly learned how to summon undead from the bones of skeletons. She somehow sensed that her parents were no longer living. This helped Frooggee learn to summon the spirits' of her parents into the bones of creatures no longer living. She uses these magical companions to protect her from the dangers of Norrath and feel protected by her lost family.<br>
<br>
Once Meana and Froogge felt they had successfully learned skills that would allow them to travel the world they, along with Frooggee's magical companion Padtole, ventured out into the world of Norrath together. Together they began searching for Frooggee's lost past and began discovering the world. <br>
<br>
Frooggee and Meana began their adventuring by saving enough coin to buy a portal to the Common Lands. Nervous and excited they met with a kind Druid named Sarsax who told them to save their coin and ported them to the West Commons. With the advice and warnings of Sarsax, Meana and Frooggee Decided to travel first to the city of Freeport then to the Dessert of Northern Ro.<br>
<br>
Before Frooggee even left the druid circle she saw and met new and interesting races. Creatures who had different skills, languages and abilities. Both Meana and Frooggee were excited about all the adventures they were about to have.<br>
<br>
Frooggee and Meana visited Freeport. They stopped and asked a guard (who would only talk to Meana and rudely ignored Frooggee) where to go for a bind and directions. Once bound in the great city the two began to make their way to Northern Ro. Frooggee, after getting separated from Meana wandered lost for hours in the city only to find Meana, much later sitting patiently at the Eastern Gate.<br>
<br>
Off the two went to Northern Ro ready to practice their newly developed skills. Frooggee collected some bones to summon Padtole and the two went exploring. They ran down the shore where the ocean of tears washes up against and found a totem pole. Frooggee and Meana decided this would be a good place to rest between battles.<br>
<br>
Padtole, Frooggee and Meana began hunting with some problems, but they were learning from their mistakes. Meana took a break after a nasty encounter with a Mummy and returned to Freeport. Frooggee and Padtole were resting quietly on the totem's step when this huge creature and his blue friend happened upon Frooggee and Padtole.<br>
<br>
The huge creature, (Frooggee later finds out this huge creature is called a Ogre), starts asking his friend if he can have Gnome pickles. Frooggee, intrigued, would like to meet these two strange travelers and find out what Gnome pickles are. She stood up and kindly introduced herself. The ogre was drooling all over him self and Frooggee was worried that he was ill. Frooggee asked him if he was feeling okay. The Ogre told Frooggee he was well, but very hungry and suddenly craving Gnome pickles.<br>
<br>
Frooggee could not take the curiosity any longer and had to ask the Ogre what Gnome Pickles were. The Ogre and his blue friend laughed loudly and Frooggee felt foolish. The Ogre's blue friend informed Frooggee that she would soon be a gnome pickle. That is when the Ogre's dark friend began attacking Padtole. Scared and shocked Frooggee screamed for Meana who soon appeared and began to fight the Ogre. The two were just to much for Frooggee and Meana and shortly they were transported back to Freeport. <br>
<br>
Naked, scared and shaken up Frooggee and Meana carefully made their way back to the totem pole in Northern Ro. Frooggee noticed Meana's body laying on the ground. Next to that was a jar that smelled of pickling spices, but Frooggee's body was no where to be found. That is when Frooggee realized she was a Gnome.  <p>Frooggee Peudlehopper
