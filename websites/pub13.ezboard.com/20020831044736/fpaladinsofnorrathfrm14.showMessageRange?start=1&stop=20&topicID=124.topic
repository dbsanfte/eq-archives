Currently the situation with Ragefire and his spawn rate is something that causes too much contention in this game.  We play a game that is designed to make us interact and work with each other.  With the reduction of ragefire pops there has become an increasingly hostile environment for clerics who wish to complete their epic.  Guilds themselves have become a part of the fight for ragefire and it is causing friends to contest each other and in the end leaves everyone involved with a bad taste in their mouth.  We each pay Verant money so that we can sit down and play a game. When we log off the game it should only be with a feeling of happiness and with memories of good times.  The ragefire spawn though leaves one to log off feeling bitter, disgusted and completly frustrated with the game.  Because of this I want to try to fix the situation.  I am asking that all players send an email to the following addresses to let verant know that we are not happy with the ending of the cleric epic.  <br>

  If you want you can just copy and paste the following to your email.<br>
<br>
  I am a player of Everquest.  I am asking the designers at Verant to please come up with a better solution for the ending of the cleric epic.  The current spawn rate and accessibilty of Ragefire causes contention and fights among people that normaly are friends.  It is my belief that the spirit of the game is something that wants us to work together and to interact with others.  Ragefire as he now is designed almost forces players to go against each other and leads to bitter feelings for everyone.  Please consider the situation as it now stands and look for a solution that will not pit friends against friends.  Thank you for your time and have a good day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  I do not know if Verant will listen to us or not, but I do know that I feel we must try to do something.  The way things are now with Ragefire simply stink.  More then one person I know says the camp is painful and wish something would be done about it.  Well now is the time for us to try to do something about it.  This message is being posted on as many boards as I can find that are related to Everquest.  Let your friends know and have them send Verant an email.  If nothing else is done atleast we will have voiced our opinons and have tried to fix the problem as best we can.  Thank you all for your time and may you have good hunting and safe journies.   <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

I think the frequency of spawns is directly tied to SOE's &quot;vision&quot; for that rate, and since they've already made changes to Ragefire I'd be pretty confident that they've discussed that aspect of it.<br>
<br>
They could move the bottleneck around, but unless they decided to up the spawn rate and let more cleric epics be completed faster, they'd have to put that bottleneck somewhere.<br>
<br>
The reason Ragefire and the cleric epic gets so much attention and causes so much heartache is that it make such a huge difference to a guild's raid capabilities.  Not their ability to kill mob X, but their ability to try mob X and not take all night recovering if they fail, or taking large breaks to rez a few dead folks because suddenly the clerics are lom.<br>
<br>
I'd venture to say that if they made Ragefire's respawn rate 1 day shorter, it wouldn't make that much difference to the way people feel about it.  For servers like mine that have Ragefire rotations, the list is months long.  The only way I could think of to &quot;fix&quot; it would to be to make Ragefire triggered on demand, which leads back to what I said about the rate of epics entering the game.<br>
<br>
While I would echo your sentiment about not liking things that make people act vicious to each other, I rather doubt SOE will decide to make Ragefire spawn daily, so I personally don't expect this situation to change significantly any time soon.<br>
<br>
I also think SOE has gotten plenty of the type of feedback you're requesting here. <p><BR>

Not perhaps the sweeping changes (i.e. removal of the bottleneck as some suggest), but changes to make sure that those who encounter ragefire are truly the ones who have the people necessary to take him.<br>
<br>
The following happened recently on my server.  Now remember, Verant's rules say that you can't &quot;camp&quot; Ragefire, he's free to the first group that engages him (play nice rule 1), although if he's contested then the people that are ready first get the first shot at him (play nice rule 3).<br>
<br>
Cleric A starts camping Ragefire right before a patch, then is back as soon as the servers come up.  &quot;A&quot; sits in the zone corner with her friends.<br>
<br>
Cleric B and her guild arrives, and camps right on top of Ragefire's spawn point with her guild.<br>
<br>
Cleric C shows up a day later, camping at another zone corner.<br>
<br>
When Ragefire spawns, he immediately aggros someone in B's group.  Ragefire is mezzed.  At this point, the puller for cleric A petitions that Rage has spawned, and someone needs to come watch to make sure it goes well.  A guide shows up and follows cleric A's monk for most of the rest of the encounter.<br>
<br>
Cleric C is the first to have troops ready.  When they are set to engage, they are informed that Ragefire has been engaged (mezzed) already.  Cleric B would be ready within another minute to take him, and it would be a conflict between these two groups, except at this point Talendor sweeps in and wipes everyone in both groups.  It is believe that someone from Cleric C's group ported in and aggroed Tal on the way there, inadvertently wiping both groups.<br>
<br>
At this point, only a few people from cleric A's groups were killed in the Talendor debacle, since most were still up in the zone corner.  About 15 minutes later, cleric A has the forces ready to take Ragefire.  Neither B or C are ready at this time, so A's puller (with the guide following) goes off to find Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is found in another corner of the zone.  Cleric B's puller is kiting Ragefire around - not to bring him in for the kill, but to keep him occupied while his forces regroup.  Given that cleric B is not ready to engage and cleric A is, cleric A's puller takes Ragefire back.  Cleric A's group kills ragefire and cleric A gets the heart.<br>
<br>
A while later, after everyone has been rezzed, a GM arrives.  The GM makes cleric A destroy the loot, then places it in cleric B's inventory.  The puller for cleric A gets a warning for stealing a mob that was engaged already.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
So what happened in summary:<br>
<br>
Cleric A was first to camp the mob, was the only group ready to engage when they did so, completed the kill, and had to destroy the loot and take a warning.<br>
<br>
Cleric B was trained by someone with cleric C, then lost the mob to cleric A while they had it in a holding pattern, and was awarded the loot without a fight.<br>
<br>
Cleric C was first ready to kill Ragefire, but didn't get the opportunity to kill or loot, likely because one of their own members wiped them out.<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
So what needs to be fixed:<br>
<br>
1. Verant must enforce its policies uniformly.  If you can't kite Lodizal around for half an hour while your forces arrive to kill him (as GMs have said before), then you can't kite Ragefire around either.  If it is ok to hold a mob while your forces arrive or buff, then say so, and deal with the two rangers who hold Ragefire for hours.<br>
<br>
2. Make Ragefire's spawn point random in the zone.  Sure, this could make him pop in a bad place.  But since he can't be &quot;camped&quot;, don't make him spawn in one place repeatedly.<br>
<br>
3. Consider perma-rooting Ragefire (the man), and making him immune to charm and mez.  This way, if you engage him, you have to kill him.  If he attacks you and you run out of his range, then he's not engaged and someone else can take him.  If you attack him but can't kill him, he'll summon and kill you unless you zone.  Of course after you zone he's not engaged anymore.<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
<br>
So anyway, those are my thoughts on Ragefire.  Anyone else have specific Ragefire horror stories, and specific suggestions to alieviate the problems? <p><center>

I believe if they publicized that the cleric epic was 'easier' to obtain... you'd have more clerics going for it thus negating the benefit of an increased spawn rate. For example, I have no intention of completing my cleric's epic as it stands now... but if you decrease the wait to something more manageable I may give it a try.<br>
<br>
Instead of getting one or two hotly contested spawns a week, you'll get three. All the same to me.<br>

Make the final turn in mob, which requires no guild backup--it's just a turn-in--spawn on the current ragefire timetable.  Individual clerics are still camping the same amount of time.  They still hate one another.  Entire guilds do not act like 2 year olds though and the CS requirements are reduced.<br>
<br>
Verant could do that and still have the same number of epics entering the world.  They won't patch it in an intelligent way so this is the best I can come up with.  It's a poortly designed quest and a poorly thought-out reward.  This way at least only the clerics suffer the extreme tedium of camping for the quest.<br>

With being able to sow and port into SF it makes very easy for pathetic little guilds who KS to port in kill port out on other guilds who have been camping it for a while. <br>
<br>
This exact thing has happend to my guild. Our cleric was at the camp for 3 days when another cleric who had just logged on told his guild it was up and they came in and KSed it. It is sad how people degrade them selves over this camp. <br>
<br>
Hopefully verant will rethink and redo this part of the epic. And spare a lot of useless name calling and KSing.<br>

<br>
Although I doubt seriously that Verant will consider doing so (due to the huge amount of negative response they would recieve from the 1st and 2nd tier guilds on EVERY server), reducing the rez on the Cleric epic to 50% or 75% would probably reduce the pressure on the spawn.<br>
<br>
And if it didn't, I'd be all for lowering the xp return to 35% and seeing what kind of change that made. <p><div align="center"><img src="http://www.emeraldis.com/~booraembj/smallbah.jpg"><BR><font size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=268670" target="new">Aragir Lancot</a><BR>

The main fight over the spawn is because of the effect that is on the epic.  So if you put in another item with the same effect but at a higher end of the game you'd solve the problem.  High end guilds can still get there clerics the effect item for raids and such.  A cleric that still wants to finish his epic can do the camp in skyfire.  The contention would be gone from the camp though because if your guild wants the effect they can get you the other item.  <br>
<br>
I intentionally left solutions out of my original post.  There are multitudes of ways for verant to change this problem around.  All I asked people to do was to get verant to review it and change it to something more friendly for the players.  If nothing else I'm hoping to get the players to think about it and try to come up with solutions.  Something has to be changed though because this is a huge sore spot in an otherwise very fun game. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

Ragefire is only an issue because clerics want their epics without having to fight over it. What cleric would want an epic with a 35% rezz and what player would want the rez? <p>

Changing the cleric epic to something LESS DESIREABLE would reduce contention for the spawn.  Because fewer people would want it.<br>
<br>
While you are correct, and I have not yet participated, and probably will never participate, in the &quot;end-game,&quot; I recognize full well the penalty imposed upon a player who accepts a 35% rez instead of a 96% rez.  However, the reduction in the xp return would not &quot;make it worthless&quot; nor would it remove its capability as &quot;a useful tool for corpse retrieval on a wipe out.&quot;  It would simply reduce dependence on the cleric epic as the tool for recovery, or it would force &quot;end-game&quot; players to sacrifice a little bit more in order to jump back into battle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoceanwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oceanwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/02 7:46:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something for everyone concerned about ragefire</span><hr size=1> Believe me Aragir a 35% exp rez on the cleric epic would make it WORTHLESS.

<br>
The end game has been structured with the cleric epic in mind.  To change it now would be disastrous.  Also, I think for an item as useful as the cleric epic it is worth it to race for the spawn.  There are possible solutions like a calendar and etc but to nerf the cleric epic is stupid. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228397">

<br>
I'd also like to point out that you are attempting to create a straw man argument by latching on to the lowest value rez I suggested, but that doesn't bother me too terribly much.  I think that unlimited mana-free rezzes should certainly provide less xp restoration than those ressurections cast by the highest level clerics.<br>

Lucky for you I don't work at Verant, eh?<br>

<br>
Rage drops it everytime and has a common spawn time.  Compare that to pal/war/bard on 7 day dragons who probably have a 50% or worse chance at dropping.  (Not to mention they're significantly tougher dragons)<br>
<br>
Cleric epic is cakewalk until the rage so pretty much every cleric thinks they ought to have it.<br>
<br>
Really though, unless you're raiding often its just good stats.  Sure it has a mana free res but thats usually not a problem.  If you raid a fair amount then there are often a lot of deaths so the cost of mana really adds up. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6318"><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/lchisholm/luth_sig.jpg" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 879<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/28/02 8:11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Destroy the cleric epic?!?</span><hr size=1> Luthair,<br>

the value of the epic is rezzing people fast with as much exp as you can get<br>
<br>
if you rez them for less % , they would not want it , coz its like taking a rezless death to most of them<br>
<br>
you know how much hour work that 6% is ?<br>
to me its worth like 2-3 hours solo <br>
<br>
a lvl 20 would love a 30% rez , hell a revive would work <br>
he can get it in 2 kills at most<br>
<br>
it doesn't work that way lvl 40+<br>
and after 55 , it get worst<br>
<br>
and by the way , that was the most foolish sloution i ever heard ( no offince ) i mean lets use it on all other epics !<br>
war epic is hard ! so lets make both sword 10/30 and proc 10 dd !!  paladins have problem with epic ! lets make it 10/60 2 hander unbashable with proc 20 DD + cease ! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushehabaldean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shehab al dean</A> at: 7/1/02 10:16:27 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showMessageRange?topicID=124.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showMessageRange?topicID=124.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=124.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showNextMessage?topicID=124.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=124.topic&index=20><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.emailToFriend?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.threadControl?topicID=124.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=124.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm21">Class Balancing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm14>Norrath Classic and Kunark</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
