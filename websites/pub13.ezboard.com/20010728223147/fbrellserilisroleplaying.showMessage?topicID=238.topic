If she ducked he'd only take it as a challenge and beat her more, or worse, the children. Kaedyen and Siledak sat huddled in a corner, crying. She blinked. She was on the floor, Karn standing over her. He had that look in his eyes, only worse.<br>
<br>
'You are WORTHLESS!', he yelled at her.<br>
<br>
He turned to the children, took a step closer, 'QUIET!', still yelling. Karn spun around and looked at her for a few seconds, disgust and anger glimmering in his eyes. He grabbed her by the hair and dragged her into the bedroom.<br>
<br>
<br>
The door slammed behind Karn and Miran. Kaed and Sil could hear their mothers repeated sobs through the door, they could hear how she begged him to stop, how she begged him to spare the children, then a cry in pain, and after that everything was quiet.<br>
<br>
<br>
When Karn opened the door he smiled. He promptly shut the door behind him, and then turned to Kaed and Sil. 'Go in there and I kill you both. Im going out for a while, I want food on the table when I get home.', he said with a dead serious voice, then he laughed to himself, opened the door and left the little house.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
The lightning lit the sky with a roar. The shadows of two men, boys, appeared on one of the tavern walls. Siledak tightened his grip around the rapier. He could hear his blood rushing through his veins. His heart pounded. The dense rain limited the sight to only a few meters ahead, but Sil knew what was there.<br>
<br>
He leaned closer to his brother, 'Tis about time', he said with a stern voice. Kaedyen just nodded. It was time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Karn Cimmerii walked towards his home with uncertain steps. He had spent his evening in the town tavern, drinking and rambling as he used to. He was almost at ease with himself. He was rid of the bitch.<br>
<br>
He wished that he'd killed them as well, but if he knew them right, they would be long gone, the whimps. And if that was the case, it wasnt a problem. They wouldn't survive the streets of freeport for long. If not a mugger got them one of the militia would.<br>
<br>
Everything was like a gray blur to him. He had found his now dead wife's savings hidden behind a tree-pannel inside there small house in the slums. Wasn't even worth mentioning, but it had payed his ale this night.<br>
<br>
He never could remember why he married her. Must've seemed good at the time, but what a mistake. She never cooked for him, never did as he told her to, nothing. She had been worthless. <br>
<br>
Not watching his steps, he tripped on a rock and fell to the ground. Dirty rain water splashed up in his face and clogged his eyes. He just laid like that for a few minutes, cursing to himself, not sure if his legs would carry him if he tried to get up.<br>
<br>
Suddenly he felt a boot knock him on the shoulder. He got up on all fours and wiped the dirt out of his eyes, and was already making up curses in his mind to damn the fool who couldn't mind his own business, but his thoughts was cut short when he looked up and stared into two gleaming cat like eyes. He couldnt help laughing. It was one of the brats. Hah! And he was armed.<br>
<br>
By Cazic-Thule, this was one pretty sight. He'd have to remember this. Ah well, might as well get rid of this brat while he had a chance. Where was the other one?<br>
<br>
As he attempted to get up a cold emotionless grin spread across the brats face...<br>
<br>
He looked down to help his arms navigate, and push himself up. As he rose he heard a silent laughter, and the second later a sharp pain went through his back. He wailed and spun around to find nothing. The brat had dissapeared. He reached back to feel the wound, and his hand got drenched in blood. He fell down to his knees, the pain pounding through his mind.<br>
<br>
He looked down on his hands, the rain washing away the blood. He tried to focus. He couldnt have. The brat. No.<br>
<br>
He heard footsteps coming from ahead, and looked up. Siledak, the other brat, appeared from the shadows and walked towards him, holding a large harpoon close to its sharp end. He was still shocked, and never had time to evade the strike. The blunt end of the harpoon hit him right on the cheek. You could hear how the jaw-bone shattered and Karn flew backwards, spun around in the air, and landed face down in the mud.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kaedyen smiled to himself as he walked up to the whining Karn. He kneeled not far from his stepfathers face, and paused there looking down at him for a few minutes. Karn was making futile efforts to get up, moaning now and then. Kaedyen couldnt help laughing.<br>
<br>
He grabbed Karn by the hair and lifted his head so that he could look straight into the now terrified eyes. He smiled as he with the other hand pulled out his dagger from the boot, and put it to Karn's throat...<br>
