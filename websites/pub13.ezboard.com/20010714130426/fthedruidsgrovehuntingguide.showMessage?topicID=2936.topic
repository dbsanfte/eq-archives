The specs here are good through lvl48, have generally good loot, and are virtually always uncamped.<br>
<br>
Getting to the island is fairly simple.  Hop on the boat in either FP or BB and head to the OOT.  Check any map site for a map of the ocean of tears that includes undead island.  It is also the home of gargoyles and greater skellies and may be labeled by that instead.  I bound on the neighboring island with the isle goblins.  This island is completely safe to 44+ druids.  From there I would levitate and 'form of the great wolf' and head over to the spectres (who showed up on track from my bind point).<br>
<br>
Once on spectre island, the routine is simple.  Cast levitate and wolf form on yourself.  Next, mem lightning strike and ensnare, and start quadkiting.  I usually ran them around the perimeter of the island despite the rugged terrain.  Keep in mind that you should be at an equal elevation as the spectres to get maximum range on your AE - if they are on a hill, get on a similarly high hill, etc.  This will allow you to avoid their close range life drain - does about 35pts of damage, so not really life threatening, but they stop to cast it and THAT can mess up your grouping.  Your AE spell has a much longer range and for the most part this is easy to avoid.  I would sometimes group them in the water - this is fairly easy to do, but is only minorly more convenient than doing it on land and generally takes more time to get them out of the water than I cared to spend.<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE - the spectres typically provide about 1 blue bub per quad.  Pretty good, especially considering you can camp them even at the busiest times of the day on my server (Druzzil Ro).  At 45, they gave 1/2 to 3/4 blue bubble per quad.  At 46-47, it went back to 1 blue bub.  They green out at 48.<br>
<br>
They respawn incredibly quickly so I never had to wait longer than it took me to med.  This keeps things rolling versus say, the dwarves, where I always found myself waiting for considerable time for the respawn (even after all mana was back) and unable to leave the docks for fear of someone taking my spot.<br>
<br>
LOOT - Effective loot (key word = effective) for this area is great.  Spectres themselves carry scythes, bronze scythes, and rusty scythes.  Unless you feel like tp'ing back to EC every five seconds, I recommend destroying all but the scythes as they are very heavy.  The scythes sell for around 10pp (even with my 45 cha) whereas the bronze only sell for around 3pp.  Spectres also drop black pearls, flawless low-level gems, globes of fear (quest LORE), random rings, and have 1-4pp each.  Some gems can be sold to other PC's for better than average money, but I typically sold to merchants.  The gargoyles (who are very green) drop gargoyle eyes worth about 7pp at merchants.  While medding, I would root and use my ES arms to kill these guys - very easy money although they would often be camped by lowbies.  Finally, on the neighboring island is the Oracle of K'Arnon.  He always drops the oracle robe (+5 int/wis, AC9, +25 mana) which you can quickly sell for 250pp to other players (or more if you feel like haggling).  He was blue to me and had some nasty DD, but root/dot combination generally got him from longer range than he had.  Keep in mind, you must harmony his guardian friend.  All told, however, this area makes for great loot and great xp.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the AC spawns on a nearby island and his PH shows up on track depending on where you are on undead island.  If you get really lucky (I did not - sniff), you might stumble across him and get some j-boots out of the deal too.<br>
<br>
Other Issues - I have read in some posts that people would not quad if there were lowbies around.  I did and only once did I have a problem (when I first got there).  While specs will aggro on other folks if you get too far away, I found they were generally pretty easy to manage and so never had issues.  If there were another non-druid class on the island camping the specs(happened once), I would only take singles since taking all four seems unfair when sharing a site.<br>
<br>
As a final note, in my waning days on the island, other folks started parking seafuries on the island.  This is not a problem as they are blue, but the corrupted seafury is red and I believe he summons.  I used flame lick to lure him to the neighboring goblin island.  I have read that flame lick will not result in summoning, but if this happens to you handle it at your own peril.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps any who were intimidated by the spectres or the rugged terrain of the island.  Remember to stock up on batwings at Inn 3 buildings in EC before you go, and enjoy a week or two in the islands.<br>

I just harmonied one and kited only three. Sometimes I had to med-kite but I generally did fine with three at 189 wis. And even when kiting all 4 I would harmony one at first. Then I had at most 3, but sometimes only 1 or 2 specs chasing me to start. Then I could go snare what I had and go pick up the rest.<br>
<br>
As for loot... Sister Isle is a 15 second run from spec isle, and they have a merchant. I would kite until I was about 200/83 on weight (destroyed the rusties cause they're not worth it) and run over to sell. After a couple rounds of selling, I'd port to Misty, bank my cash in River, and gate back. Even severly encumbered I had no trouble outrunning the specs. When ensared they go veeeery slow, and 44 wolfy is very fast. Just have to lengthen your run by a few seconds as you get fatter.<br>
<br>
And garg hunters were never a problem for me, so long as I knew they were there. I'd let them know when I pulled if they wanted, and kept an eye out for them. Tried to stay in the same section of the island too. Only time I ever had a problem was when someone had left for awhile, and didn't tell me she was back. Ran four spectres right through her =( She didn't last long.<br>
<br>
And batwings, yes. I always had 80 or so ;) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukytelae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytelae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/28/01 8:09:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.river.org/~jnfr/EQ/mtg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guide to Spectres in OOT for 44-48</span><hr size=1> This is a great guide.

<br>
In reality, it is pretty darn good xp - decent loot, just be careful of lowbies killing gargoyles.  The initial attack on the 4 can be a bit chaotic and any lowbies too close by may accidently get some aggro.<br>

Specs continue to be blue into 48 and even 49, although 49 opens up considerable new options with the new AE spell.  While at first I tried the spirocs for 48 using a root/dot combination, I eventually found myself returning to the specs for the peace and quiet, and improved loot.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest advantages for this place is the 10 minute-at-a-time AFK option when you regen mana.  With no competition for the site, you can be far less vigilant than you might be when camping more sought after spawns like the dwarves.  For those of you constrained in your playing time by significant others, this option is a little more palatable when you only disappear for 2-3 minutes and then come back for 10 minutes as opposed to being on the computer the entire time. 8)  For those of you without such constraints, I salute you.<br>

Good hunting.<br>

Loot is pretty good... only problem is if you have to med kite it may be easier to hit f9 to see all around view cause darn near everything around the sro zone will agro (annoying dry bones and mummies and orcs :P).  good luck<br>

First, how do you pull, just ensnare one and snare the rest when they come after you?  And second, how do you get them stacked together?  I've been doing dire wolves for awhile now, I usually use the V method where you let them all come at you while slowly backing away out of reach, and they soon clump together to get at you.  This doesn't seem to work with specs, since you can't let them get close because of the lifetap spell.  Do you just buff up and take some hits to get them together, or is there another method I don't know of.  Any advice on pulling them and stacking them is much appriciated. <p><center><img src=http://members.aol.com/amergin22/myhomepage/sig.jpg><br>Druid of the 43rd Season-Lanys T'Vyl</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gellan>Gellan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/20/01 1:36:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: specs</span><hr size=1> Good questions.<br>
<br>
Answer to Question #1<br>
I would ensnare (never snare) one and then start ensnaring the rest as they came after me.  Usually, only 1 or 2 additional aggro, although sometimes all 4 can aggro.  As long as you have levi going, you should be fine in pulling away without taking any falling damage.  The fast guys (non-ensnared) stand out pretty quick.<br>
<br>
Answer to Question #2<br>
One of these easiest ways to gather/group them is to run into the water with all 4 ensnared and just run circles around them.  Again, with levi this is doable.  Alternatively, you can just run circles around them in the rocks.  Occasionally, I would use the lifetap to my advantage - if one or two are lagging the group, allow the first bunch to lifetap you and the others will close the gap while the lifetap'rs stand still.<br>
<br>
Good luck and good hunting.<br>

I'll work on getting them together in the water too, I had a lvl 21 chanter killing gargs on the other side of the island and was trying to be very cautious not to bring them too close to him, so my best bet would be to round them up in the water.

<br>
A couple of quick additions:<br>
<br>
1. If you are alone on the island (which was often the case), I'd recommend that you invest a little bit of time up front to kill all of the gargs.  They will respawn as skeletons which will not agro on you (which the gargs will).  Just start your camp session with a quad (or more) of all of the gargs and keep doing it until they have all respawned as skeletons (usually only took one quad with a couple of rekills).  One other note - if you do not kill all of the gargs, they will often end up killing the skeletons and you will be back to square 1 :).<br>
<br>
2. While quadding them around the island works great (I did that for the 1st zillion spectres :), it also works to drag them across the water to the goblin island - this also gives you a bit more time to group them up.  Just watch out for the random gobbies as they will aggro on you occasionally - not much damage - but a real spell-interrupter :).<br>
<br>
3. One thing I started doing later on as I was taking the specs over to the goblin island was doing some underwater quadding (oh yea - don't forget that your spell will not hit if they are underwater and you are not).  This worked great as they move pretty slowly when snared and underwater and I could usually get around 2-4 lightning strikes off before we even got to the goblin island.<br>
<br>
4. Don't forget your swim suit and fishing pole when you camp the specs!!  I did a TON of fishing while medding (got my fishing from abysmally low to around 120 at the specs) and I started swimming between the islands rather than levitating (got my swimming up above 100 as well doing this).  You can buy the fishing poles and bait from the sisters.<br>

I have seen the spec I pulled pass directly through the spec I harmonied and he just stood there. Just zap one or two and you can pull fewer at a time. Then get what you pulled snared and go back for the rest.<br>
<br>
For targeting the non-snared pulls, I found a few tricks that worked. If you hit F2 or whatever, to get your target box cleared, then click a few feet ahead of the specs you pulled,  9 1/2 times out of 10 you'll target the one (or one of the ones) that isn't snared since it's moving faster than those who are and should be a bit ahead. Or if you want to get smacked, just stand there and wait to get lifetapped. The non-snared spec should get to you first, and when it taps you, you'll target it automatically if your target box is empty. The snare it, run off and clear your target and wait to get smacked again.

Just stay away from this spot if you play on Lanys, I still need a few more levels off these guys. :b <p><center><img src=http://members.aol.com/amergin22/myhomepage/sig.jpg><br>Druid of the 45th Season-Lanys T'Vyl</center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showMessage?topicID=3045.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showMessage?topicID=3038.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.emailToFriend?topicID=2936.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.threadControl?topicID=2936.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2936.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2936.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm16">Velious<option value="thedruidsgrovekunark">Kunark<option value="thedruidsgroveclassbalanceissues">Class Balance Issues<option value="thedruidsgrovetheruins">The Ruins<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicstories">Druidic Stories<option value="thedruidsgrovethetradingpost">The Trading Post<option value="thedruidsgrovelatestpatchdiscussions">Latest Patch Discussions<option value="thedruidsgroveintroduceyourself">Introduce Yourself<option value="thedruidsgroveannouncementssuggestions">Announcements/Suggestions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide>Hunting Guide</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
