Then I was confused with how to create the account... so she had to walk me through the process, saying &quot;Hmmm... I don't remember that when I signed up.&quot; and &quot;Oh to hell with it, I don't know what you are talking about.&quot;<br>

I'm not certain which it is but I have heard them for as long as I can remember.  Maybe it is both!  They have become very distracting, making it hard for me to think and even harder for me to concentrate.  Naera says its all an act, a need for attention.  I don't see how I would want to bring attention to myself as I am content to sit about watching others and thinking of strange things and funny situations.  Like last night, when I was sitting in the corner of the library reading the book and Resha burst in with that cute fellow.  I thought of how funny it would be if Naera caught her with one of those dreaded 'breeds' and it would have been funny too, if Naera wasn't the type to go about on a breed killing rampage of some sort, slaughtering breeds everywhere she went.  That girl's hatred is going to be the death of her but there I sat, in the corner, watching Resha and that boy whispering and kissing and I imagined Naera bursting into the room with sword in hand screaming &quot;Die breed&quot; and slashing at him as he ran across the room, trying to escape and Resha trying to save him.  Now the thought itself wasn't nearly as funny as what the voices started saying.  I was just merely amused with the thought of Naera catching them but the First Voice said &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword, wouldn't it be better if she wrote it on some parchment instead of screaming it?&quot;  That only got the Second Voice angry who said &quot;Where do you come up with rediculous ideas such as that?  Are you daft?&quot;  Which got the Third Voice started who said &quot;Don't call him daft!  He's saner than the five of us put together!&quot;  Which made the Fourth Voice say &quot;What five of us?  I only count four!&quot;  Which the First Voice responded &quot;You're forgetting Mailea.  There's me, you, you, you and her.  That makes five!&quot; and the Third Voice said &quot;Aren't we getting a bit crowded in here though?  I mean FIVE of us is a lot!&quot;  Oh but how I am tired so I will stop here and begin anew tomorrow.  Perhaps they will not distract me so that I can finish telling you how I started giggling at the things they were saying and Resha and her friend became very embarrassed.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Xelita took a deep breath as she finished reading the journal entry.  &quot;I wish I knew what was really going on in your head, daughter.&quot;  She skimmed through a few pages until the word 'druid' caught her eye.  Alarmed, she began to read the entry.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Of course I wasn't suppose to be that far out in the forest but the Fourth Voice said I would be fine and nothing would happen and that he knew the way to these fantastic ruins that I just had to see.  The Second Voice told me that we were going in the wrong directions for ruins and that the Fourth Voice was either lost or daft because we were going to the rings.  Ruins, rings... what was the difference?  So the Fourth Voice was a little confused by what it was we were going to see but I didn't care, just to be free for a few moments without Naera breathing down my neck.  I simply shivered with anticipation and followed the Fourth Voices directions.  I spotted the ruined ring at the bottom of a hill and ran to it, curious.  I had never seen ruins or rings and this was by far the best being a ruined ring, or so I thought at the time because it was one of those killing two birds with one stone type things where you get two for one.  The First Voice began telling me that it was a druid ring and I grew excited.  Imagine, meeting a real live druid and not seeing one of the corpses of one left by the guards.  The questions I had!  The Third Voice said that the druids were still there and that I had better be careful and keep an eye out.  I should have listened to the Second and Third Voices and maybe even the First because the druids were still around there and they didn't like me being there.  They hadn't even said hello before they started casting spells on me, causing my skin to burn and sting and all sorts of nasty things.  I ran up the hill and saw Naera running towards me and told her to run because of the druids but she didn't listen because she tried to fight them.  The Fourth Voice told me to stand and fight with her but the others said to go home because I wasn't ready and that I could come back and fight them again.  I did as the others said, thinking they knew best because it was the Fourth Voice that was wrong the first time.  Naera came in a bit later and patched me up fine and scolded me.  She was very upset with my disobedience which I can't say that I don't blame her, she was right about a few things as the Second Voice pointed out after she had left and went to get drunk.  Lucky for me, Mother and Resha had went off somewhere in the Karanas for a holiday of some sort or other or I would have been in a lot of trouble.  I thought Naera would tell Mother when Mother came home but she didn't and I don't rightly know how to express my gratitude considering everytime I bring it up, Naera grows angry and storms off to get a drink.  Ah well.  Off to bed I go, tired as usual.  Luckily I don't have scars from the incident.  I don't think that would sit well with Mother.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Xelita's hand shook as she closed the journal.  She had always thought that these 'voices' Mailea heard were imaginary friends she played with as a child, but Mailea was no longer a child and it was clear to Xelita that the 'Fourth Voice' was a threat.  <br>
<br>
She began to make a mental list to try and classify these 'voices'.  It couldn't be Mailea's imagination because they knew the forest fairly well.  Mailea had never stepped foot off the paths.<br>

They had heard of their mother speaking his name to others but have never met him.  <br>
<br>
Resha's eyes narrowed.  &quot;And to what do we owe this honor?&quot;  She glanced back at her sister, not liking the glint in her eye.  She stepped forward, extending her hand to lead him into the library.  <br>
<br>
He took her hand gracefully, smiling.  &quot;You look like your mother when she was your age.  Well, except for that short manly hair.&quot;<br>
<br>
Resha looked at the man with indifference, surprised by the softness of his skin.  She was use to callused hands, hands that were use to weilding swords.  Strong hands of true fighters.  Not the soft and unblemished hands of casters.  &quot;I am an adult.  I choose how I wear my hair just as you chose to wear that robe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you have the smart mouth your mother still sports to this day.&quot;  The man growled.<br>
<br>
Naera followed them to them to the library taking a seat on the settee.  &quot;That comment was uncalled for.  We have accepted your presence in our home.  I would advise you to keep such comments to yourself.  Show respect, sir, or find the door.&quot;  She smirked as she added, &quot;My mother and my sister are not the only ones with smart mouths or large egos.  There are a total of four women in this house.  My mother and two daughters who follow in her footsteps to some extent.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man raised an eyebrow at her and questioned, &quot;And the other?&quot;<br>
<br>
Resha gave a warning glance to Naera but Naera ignored it.  &quot;Mad.  She hears voices, several of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Comes from bad breeding.&quot;  He chuckled at the angry looks he received from the two young women.  &quot;Oh come now.  I meant her father.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We do have company!&quot;  All eyes turned to the young lady in a dark robe standing in the doorway.  &quot;Vendui.  I am Mailea Tytani.  Welcome to my home.&quot;  She walked across the library and stood before him.  She smiled at him as she curtsied and then cocked her head to one side muttering under her breath.  A shocked look came across her features as a blush rose into her cheeks.  &quot;I will not!&quot;<br>
<br>
The man stared at her for a moment and smiled.  &quot;She is mad because she has good manners?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mailea looked flustered for a moment and sat down beside him.  &quot;What is your profession?  Are you a wizard?  How old are you?  Do you like brandy?  I simply adore brandy.  Chazk, fetch the brandy!  Mother only buys the best brandy.  She likes brandy as well.&quot;  She cocked her head to one side again.  &quot;Good point.  Pardon, sir, but just who the hell are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your mother sent a letter to me from the Karanas.  She said that I was to come here and take you to her, Mailea.&quot;  He smiled as he handed the letter to her for her to read.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm.&quot;  She read it, frowning.  &quot;I recognize my own mother's handwriting, thank you.  I am not daft.&quot;  She skimmed the page and then shouted, &quot;Silence!  I can't think with all of you chattering like that.&quot;  She handed the letter back to him.  &quot;Annoying they might be but they are not a danger to my well being.  Tell her that I decline.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned to Naera.  &quot;Help me.  Remember the halflings?  It was the voices that lead her astray.&quot;<br>
<br>
Naera looked at Resha who was staring at the man.  Mailea climbed to her feet and looked down at him.  &quot;Not all of them lead me astray.  Only one and he has been silenced.  Thank you for coming but your services are not needed.  Aluve.&quot;  She turned away from them, talking under her breath as she left the library.<br>
<br>
Resha raised an eyebrow at the man as he continued to plead with Naera for her assistance.  &quot;You must forgive me but if Mailea says that your services are not needed, then your services are not needed.  I will dispatch a letter to Mother explaining.  Good day to you, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
His gaze traveled from one mask of indifference to another.  He climbed to his feet and walked to the doorway.  &quot;I will not let this rest.  Your mother has found someone who can help her.  I will wear you down until you accept it and assist me.&quot;  He stepped out of the library and walked down the hallway.<br>
<br>
He nodded curtly to the servant at the door as the servant held the door open for him.  He walked on the stone path leading to the street, cursing.  &quot;Damn you, Xelita.  How do you expect me to deal with three younger versions of you when I cannot even deal with your stubborness?  Damn you.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was halfway to his home when he heard someone shouting his name.  He turned and saw Naera rushing towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shub, wait!&quot;  She gasped, out of breath.  She stood before him, trying to slow her breathing.  &quot;Resha doesn't understand.  She wasn't there and I refuse to be Mailea's keeper any longer.  I wish to live my own life.&quot;  She looked  him in the eye, hatred shining deep within the depths of her own orbs.  &quot;I will help you.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxelita.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xelita</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Streak</span><br>  Posts: 1423<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/15/02 8:32:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=477.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *smiles*</span><hr size=1> I get the point.
