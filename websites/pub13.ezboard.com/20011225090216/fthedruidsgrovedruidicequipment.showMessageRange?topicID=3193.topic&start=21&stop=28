<br>
To Silly:  Yes this can affect me as I might have a slim chance at obtaining this sheild (as much of a chance as anyone) as my guild has been hunting HoT for the last month and is working on moving to the named and *hopefully* the cursed guy at the end with help from our allies.<br>
<br>
To all others.  The druid class is a versatile class, yes that is true.  That is the largest reason we are LEATHER based classes.  If you look at the three priest classes.  Druids have the most versatile abilities/spells, so they are leather, the second lowest ac armor class around.  Shamans are second to druids in the priest classes to variety in spells, that is a large reason why they are CHAIN based class, the third lowest (second highest) AC armor class.  Clerics have barley anything for versatility and that is a large reason why they get the best AC armor around for priest classes.  Of course there are other reasons, but in the encounters that I have been in in the last three months I have found that for resists, EVERYONE needs them, no class is less in need of resists then another, unless you want to do a mellee/caster(wis/int) division argument.  AoE's kill if you do not have resists, no matter who you are.  Ok, now stats (hp, mana, sta, agi, etc...), why would a cleric be more in need of a larger mana pool then a druid? so they can heal more?, well, if a druid had a larger mana pool they can dot, nuke, heal, root, ds, and do whatever they need to do more.  Each class has a job they have to do and the mana pool dictates how much they can do at one time, so why give one class a larger mana pool, higher agi, higher wisdom, higher hp, higher sta etc.. buffs then the other? (keep in note I am talking about the priest classes here not the mellee or int caster classes).<br>
<br>
Fact is, clerics get higher ac then the other two priest classes, but by giving the druids less mana/hp/stats/resists then the clerics you are just making it so the druids cannot use their variety in spells and so are a bit less usefull and who wants a less usefull druid over a higher usefull one?<br>
<br>
This is class/armor envy, I admit that, but I think I have a pretty good reason.  If I got this sheild I would be amazed just because of the time/effort/luck involved in the roll on the quest items.  So dont get me wrong, I would be exstatic if I go this sheild, I am just pointing out a common occurance that I run into with priest armor.<br>

<br>
Honestly, we have many resist spells we can cast to further buff our resistances that other classes do not have available to them.  As a mater of fact, given the shields you described, a druid would still come out ahead on stats with our resist buffs on.  Perhaps that is a viable explanation for you.<br>
<br>
I imagine you are capable of obtaining the shield, I guess my real question as to why this would bother you so much, is how does it make this great shield any &quot;less&quot; great because a cleric has a better one?  I guess it's all perspective.  This is one of the best shields a druid can aquire, yet you still find fault.  I don't understand.....<br>

Now that the sheild has been upgraded it seems one of my proofs have become less solid :-\, but /shrug, at least we won on this one, I would rather have it this way then me being able to still use the sheild as a proof down the line.  I am content with my druid, I still play him and he is 57 at the moment.  I do quests as soon as they come out and I make an effort to do all the quests that will benefit me somehow.  Hell, I do quests to get stuff that is equal or a bit less then dropped loot just because they are quests and I can most likely get them in less time by not competing with other classes for the drops.  This argument was just meant to give an overview of a general trend in all druidic available/druid only equipment when compaired to the other two priest classes equipment.<br>
<br>
I really like playing my druid and do not find it to hard to find groups because I usually group in the same spots (velious) for experience and on my server (Drinal) grouping in velious for exp in places like SG, VL, and DN has just become popular where before it was a very tight group that you would see in DN all the time and we would always call on each other to group together because DN is a very involved zone that if you know the zone well you can do CR's in a matter of minutes and get back to raking in the exp and loot.  Anyways, I have gone off of the topic, but I guess I just needed to say that everyone reading this, I LIKE playing my druid over most other characters, so this is not a rant against druids but an argument against VI's reasoning for having the stats on our druid only and druid available armor the way they are.<br>

"<br>
<br>
Depends on how you define great.  You have to make a comparison to determine if something is great or not.  <br>
<br>
In a way it does make it less great if you are comparing between shields.  If you are comparing from what is the best shield for that class, then the cleric shield dosn't have bearing on the other shields greatness. BUT!! while it makes for a nice sounding argument (verant uses it all the time btw) in practicality we do not measure this way.<br>
<br>
The hypocracy is made more clear if you exagerate the difference between the items.  Imagine the cleric shield kept its current stats but the best that a druid could get would be equivilent to a shiny brass shield.  <br>
<br>
Would you feel the same way about your shiny brass shield since it was the best you could get?  Naw you'd prolly become a cleric.<br>
<br>
While you would probably be a happier person if you didn't compare your equiptment with stuff you cant use, its just not gonna happen very often in the real world, and it should be a consideration to the game designers.<br>
<br>
anyhow thats my take on it. <p><p><br>-Kiliaan Spiritwind<br>Preserver of Tunare<br>Avatar of Raj Artair<br><EMBED src="http://216.74.111.86/~synastu/images/footer3.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000  WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=40 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"></EMBED></p><i></i></td></tr></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessageRange?topicID=3193.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessage?topicID=3325.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessage?topicID=3274.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.emailToFriend?topicID=3193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.threadControl?topicID=3193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3193.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3193.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment>Druidic Equipment</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
