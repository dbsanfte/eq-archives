Special features: in this zone you can engage in aerial battles against dragons, a &quot;mini-game&quot; zone<br>
while on dragon back you can cast spells, and melee but melee is limited to lances and ranged weapons<br>
MOBs here are all aerial, and can only be engaged on dragon back, or if you're feeling brave, on the ground using magic and ranged weapons<br>
while on dragonback, a special box pops up that allows you to use the dragon's abilities: fear, breath, claw, and controls<br>
there are SOME ground based mobs, like wurms and rock monsters and bandits, but they don't drop anything and are just there for entertainment<br>
The entire zone is based on one RoF type encounter, with dragons attacking over and over in waves, low HP<br>
all weapons must be left on the ground and dragonlances, dragonbows and crossbows must be rented from the dragon stables<br>
dragon choices:<br>
Blue: smaller, more agile, magic based breath<br>
Red: Larger, powerful fire breath, more HP<br>
White: ability to heal, cold based, higher resistances<br>
Green: poison/disease breath, largest<br>
<br>
Mobs are all types of dragons dropping cash and red, white, and green dragonscales until:<br>
Zorvalax the Obliterator<br>
HP 2,000,000<br>
Resistances:<br>

<br>
I would start by spreading rumors that &quot;once you see this zone, you'll never go back to NToV again&quot;.  Following this, I would put a few hooks into the game for a broken key quest, possibly making the faction broken or something equally obscure so that no one can actually say that it's broken or whether it's just a really really rare drop/mob.<br>
<br>
Once this hook has been placed, I'd start a few designers working on the zone.  Not too many - after all, if people ever finish the key quest I end up implementing then they are already hooked so why chew up dev dollars on already guaranteed revenue?  Probably make the architecture quite beautiful - want good demo screenshots to keep that hook in people's mouths.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I'd scrap the broken key quest and put a real one in the game that involves a whole stack of rare drops from rare random spawns.  Something that takes around 200 to 300 hourse of camping for the lucky people.  That guarantees more revenue and gives my designers more time to complete the zone.  Liberal use of lame tricks like DT on key piece mobs is also a good idea.<br>
<br>
Once players are getting close to completing the key, finish up the zone by reusing existing mob models, just making them really, really big and divide the zone up into a few different locked areas.  Just to ensure the players spend more time in the zone, make the keys no rent and put a pretty fast respawn on the mobs so the players can't move through all that quickly.  Giving the mobs some really annoying abilities (say, AE blind) would probably work out well and upping the AC and HP to insane levels to ensure the fights last a hellishly long time is probably a good thing.  After all, delayed gratification is the secret to addiction, right?<br>
<br>
At the end of all this, put some fairly tame loot on the mobs and wait for the first few groups to go through to give suggestions on what they think the risk/reward should be set up.  I mean, why do more work than you have to?<br>
<br>
(Yeah, I know I embellished parts of that.  Was fun to write though)<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, seriously:<br>
<br>
If I was making a zone or set of zones I'd do a similar thing to what was found in the Velious expansion.  Have different factions and a gradual progression of difficulty for each faction as well as faction aligned quests.  I would also try to work on encounters that work at defeating the MT/CHeal standard strategy but there are some significant limitation in the game mechanics that really prevent this from happening too well.  I would probably include some REVERSIBLE game changing event which involved shifts in the power of the factions or similar.  Personally I think Velious was the best expansion to date.  Luclin could have been great (with Seru/Katta/Akheva factions) but never really forced you to align one way or the other.  I'm really hoping PoP is a lot like Velious...<br>

I threw out a few concept zones that are strikingly similar to Jaggedpine, Thurgadin, and Grieg's End. I'm by no way saying I inspired those zones (the groundwork was already there) but I did get a direct reply from John Smedley saying what good ideas they were. I'm still waiting for my royalty check <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
One zone I wish they had done already was the Plane of Pestilence. F that silly plane of Mischief, they could have dumped that into Planes of Power along with the Plane of Wherever the Hell Quellious resides and no one would care. <br>
<br>
But to have a Plane of Pestilence would be real nice. A decrepid castle/tower surrounded by a decaying forest-swamp. Make the castle/tower five levels tall (or deep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) with 4 floor bosses and Bertoxx at the very top/bottom. Have him have 4 sub-bosses (1 per level) who are akin to the Four Horsemen, a &quot;general&quot; boss on the top level just before Bertoxx who's something of a Grim Reaper-esque mob and then Ole Bert himself. Tie him in with quests to Plane of Growth/Plane of Truth where turning in his head nets you a killer weapon from either Tunare or Mithaniel Marr (pallies of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <p><DIV ALIGN="center">
