<br>
Although this is my first post on this forum, I have been reading and enjoying everyone else's posts for a number of months.<br>
<br>
What I am looking for at this time is any advice you can give me as to where to hunt at level 44.  I prefer to group whenever I can, although I do solo from time to time.  Currently, I've been grouping in Dreadlands and soloing or partnering up in Great Divide.  Are there any other zones which would give me good experience at my level, either grouped or solo/partnered up?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help,<br>

I don't have any real insights as I've had to solo since I don't have the time to play as much anymore but I suppose you could go across the zone line to BW and kill hornets with your new Banish Summon spell. I've been in Eastern Wastes at the Orc Fort and also killing Man O Wars trying to get Ro's on my own. Guk is a good spot too if you want to group and get some good loot too if you haven't been there already. SolB would a good spot as well for grouping. You could go to Ocean of Tears and kill spirocs and spectres or go to Oasis too if you are good at quadding. Lake of Ill Omen and do the Bloodgill Goblins. Those are good XP. I'm just re-iterating what I can recall from other posts here.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umarblond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marblond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/14/01 6:04:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where to hunt at 44</span><hr size=1> Where to hunt should be up to you, but I can tell you where I hunted since level 40 (i'm 46 now): Negafen's Lair.<br>
The place was the best exp I could find, it got me through 45 hell in three days, and the loot is pretty nice too. I was hunting in the dungeon's Named Group. The only problem with this spot is that it's usually taken and there is a list you must add yourself to. So what I did was I usually got myself on that list, by shouting Camp check in the dungeon and sending a tell to whoever replied &quot;named&quot;, and then I went to solo in Dreadlands until my turn came up. Negafen's Lair, aka Sol B, is entered in Lavastorm, very close to the druid ring, so basically you can bind yourself anywhere and hunt there until you're up in Sol B, and then you just port yourself there.<br>
Like I was saying, I'm 46 now, and I still find the Named group to have good exp for me. You can also settle for the Window group in the dungeon, I think it beats Dreadlands. Another possible group is Bugs, but it is considered a lot harder while the exp is pretty much the same, as far as I could see.<br>
A fact that might be a problem to some people is that Sol B is a dungeon, so no SoWs can save you here. However, Named, Window and Bugs are all relatively close to the zone, so I didn't die too much. And even when you do, you can usually find a cleric to rez you within the dungeon, as it is a dungeon with many casual players, unlike Guk, for example.<br>
Another issue is that there are many trains to the zone entrance, so if you added yourself to one or more lists you are strongly advised to go elsewhere until you're called for duty.<br>
One of the benefits is that the Named group actually camps three rooms: Champion Room (where the group is usually located), Priest Room and King Room. The Kobold King drops RMB commonly, so it's pretty nice for the Druids that don't have one yet. His rare drop is Fleshripper, a Nodrop weapon that is used for Warrior's Epic. The priest drops Carnal Pauldrons as common, nice Nodrop Pauldrons for those who can wear plate, and Mithril Breastplate as rare. The Champion's common is Shield of the Slain Unicorn, a lame shield that can be sold in EC to newbies for 80p or so. His rare drop is Painbringer, another nodrop weapon that is used in warrior's epic, but this one is also useless, unlike the Fleshripper that is actually a pretty nice weapon for SKs and Warriors (2hs). The group sometimes pull the Noble Room as well, and the Kobold Noble there drops Staff of Writhing as common and Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet as rare. This pull is usually very dangerous, as the Noble is an enchanter that often charms the poor monk or warrior that is elected to be the puller. So make sure you use your SV Magic buffs before pulling the Noble. Basically I have seen all the drops I stated above except the Heart Amulet, so it might be very rare.<br>
In the King Room also spawns Targin the Rock, which drops Code of Zan Fi, used for monk epic. He spawns rarely, and from what I've seen right after he dies, the king spawns.<br>
Have fun in this nice camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urumil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rumil</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/15/01 1:50:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.e-corridor.com/images/EQ/tinyrumil.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where to hunt at 44</span><hr size=1> Eastern Wastes / Great Divide <br>

Both great spots for a Druid of your rank, I would choose EW personally, go to the south and have a field day on Rhinos, Mammoths and such, great exp not such great loot. <p>Warden of Tunare<br>

Its slow because their hit points are too high to quad for me. So I do the root/dot/med method. Horrible loot but decent exp in this hell level. If you can get a group to go there you will clean up with exp. Timorous is a highly underused zone and a group could spend all day at the Spiroc city and only encounter the rare soloist there like myself from time to time. So the spawn will be yours. Or you can solo them like I do. They resist about 10 - 15% of your ensare/root/dots but I never get touched by them. <br>
<br>
I tried the Specs in Feerrott but getting them to group up is horrible. They mana drain you and by the time you get them to line up your quad attempt has failed either by you running away from lack of hit points or just getting fed up. They are easy to root/dot/med though.<br>
<br>
I also tried the Bloodgills in Lake Omen. This one was fatal however. I consider myself a good quad kiter, if not damn good, and my first and only attempt at these was fatal. They are underwater inside and around their fort / building. I went down there, looked around a bit, and saw goblins just kind of floating around. I snared one, turned around and started to head for shore. Well two more agroed. And they swim faster than me (i had 140swim and in form of the great wolf). i have levitate on hoping i could get above water, that didnt work. by the time i got to shore i was dead. I hate dying in hell levels. I don't know how people quad these things. I also didn't spend any time trying to figure it out so if anyone knows how or has a link to a guide please post it in a response!<br>
<br>
Also, the dorfs (Den and Friends, or Den and Co.) by the shore in Butcher Block are great. You only lose Kaladim Merchant faction, guards still consider me an Ally! You can triple kite them. By the time your mana returns to full they have respawend. And killer loot. I highly recomend!<br>
<br>
But for a change of scenery I am doing the Spirocs now. Going insane doing the same old same old. And I hate Dread Lands at mid 40's. Slow exp, even with a fast group.<br>
