<br>
Sorry, Xaviel, you're wrong.  Go and actually test the spells instead of relying on the listings at various sites, which also are wrong.  <br>
<br>
Or you can rely on the fact that I actually have tested each of our DoTs, and have confirmed that the durations are 10 and 11 ticks of damage.  See the Spells: DoT thread in the Archives for those testing results.<br>
<br>
BTW, I do know the source of the listing problem.  They presumed that our DoTs work like the DoTs of other classes, where there is an initial application of damage followed by damage per tick over time.  So when you see a listed duration for Winged Death of 9 ticks, what they really mean is 10 applications of damage: the initial plus 9 subsequent ticks.<br>
<br>
Our DoTs don't work that way...there is no initial damage.   Instead, the first application of damage occurs at the end of the first tick.  And subsequent damage is applied at the end of each tick.  The last bit of damage for Winged Death occurs at the end of the 10th tick.  The last bit of damaged for Drones of Doom, in contrast, occurs at the end of the 11th tick.  <br>
<br>
Believe me, I have sat and watched each bit of damage each tick for each DoT take effect (testing on myself).  I know for a fact that the duration is 10 or 11 ticks, not 9.<br>
<br>
I also know that the listed damage is wrong.  But that's another story.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxaviel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaviel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 9:41:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Well enough, then.

<br>
You're conveniently dancing around the resist rate factor, which you <b>know</b> skews those numbers.  Normal DoTs are usually resisted at least 10-15% of the time against average resist targets, meaning their efficiency will be significantly less than what is listed, whereas swarms are resisted no more than about 5% against any NPC, even ones with very high resists.<br>
<br>
Necros and shamans do have a low-resist "comeback" for the low 50s -- splurt and the shaman epic effect -- but if you give druids a low-resist level 60 DoT, necros and shamans will be left wanting, like children who were passed over for the lollipop.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as High Priest of PvV you should be painfully aware that any such discussion will focus everyone's attention to the ultra-low resist property of the swarm line, a fact which is relatively unknown to other classes.  This may engender envy in some members of those classes, who will scream for a nerf to the already supremely overpowered Everquest class (druids).  You know what will likely happen next -- an across the board nerf to everyone, as Verant suddenly realizes that DoTs aren't "working as intended".  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 2/25/02 6:53:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 11:37:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i'm going to touch on not just dots here, but this has bothered me for a while...<br>
something commonly overlooked is our lack of damage spell upgrades.  we have received.... NONE since kunark (except moonfire and i will refuse to acknowledge its existence until it becomes a viable spell that is at LEAST better than our lvl 49 cold nuke).  enchanters, clerics, shaman, necros, wizards, magis, you name it, have received upgrades dots or dds or in some cases both.<br>
<br>
DDs:  we need to make an argument to remove the outdoor only restriction from BoK.  ideally they would get rid of all non-movement outdoor-only restrictions on spells, since the game has grown since release to the point that the high majority of high level hunting is now indoors.  druids are really the only class crippled by stepping foot into a dungeon.  BoK is important as it is our only higher level decent damage magic check nuke.  against mobs that are only magic susceptible, we cant nuke at all.  i would also advocate removing the stun portion of the spell as that increases the resists, and would be an easy price to pay to make this spell indoor usable.<br>
<br>
<br>
**important thing to note here**<br>
as for dots, i would really prefer a swarm line BUT.... and i havent see anyone mention this yet.... we have to look at stackability.  if its swarm line, that means we are stuck with it and boro, yes?  uncomfortable idea in my eyes.  i would rather have an upgrade to boro, with or without the fire debuff since im not sure what would be best, and use that and wd as our top dots.  plus as the flame line, which is evocation, it would give a slight edge to our evoc brethren over the nothing bonus that 99% of us get from the winged line.  and it makes little sense to me to replace the higher level higher damage spell with an upgrade when we could instead get rid of that bitch of a spell BoR.<br>
<br>
as for dot level and damage, i think i would rather see it at 58 or 59... mainly because they've started doing some really nasty things with our lvl 60 spells, and i'd rather see this spell come in and be achievable by the majority of druids than see it stuffed onto a remote lvl 70 mob somewhere in the depths of luclin as &quot;loot&quot; where only 5% of us will ever see it.  the damage should at least be somewhere in the 1700-2000 ballpark to make it much of an improvement over either the lvl 52 or 54 dots. <p>-K<br>

<br>
I'm not sure that I buy into the notion that the swarm series really has a super low resist.  True, I rarely see it resisted.  But I also have to observe that it's not flagged in SPDAT as having a low resist.  Personally, I think that spells with multiple resistable effects do have increased opportunities for resists.  Regardless of whether they do or not, though, let's assume that they do and compare like to like here...<br>
<br>
All shaman DoT spells have multiple effects.  Further, I'm thinking that they're probably also &quot;all or nothing&quot; spells, at least to the extent that if the initial damage component is completely resisted the rest of the spell fails as well.  I don't think we can fairly compare resists on Shaman and druid spells.<br>
<br>
The same applies to a lot of necro spells.  The disease and poison spells seem to be little different from shaman spells, and the darkness series includes a snare component.  The two spell lines that appear to come close to druid DoT's would be the Leach series and the Heat Blood series.  My experience with my necro is quite limited (level 13), but I seem to recall these spells being among my favorites because they had lower resists!<br>
<br>
So, Tudamorf, I guess I would have to say that I don't buy the notion that resist factor is a problem.  Low resists for druid swarm dots are normal across all levels, but I think it's simply the mechanics of how the spell works.   I would expect an upgrade to also be low resist, while still preserving about the same damage proportion relative to other classes that was seen at lower levels.  I hardly think that keeping a spell line proportional across levels is unreasonable.  And let's face it...  An upgraded swarm dot isn't much of a lollipop when it comes to druids in the high end game.  Looks to me like a reason for one druid to be at the raid, since DoT's don't stack.<br>

They're favorites to be used in pvp (as your mr stat doesn't help in resisting), their only downsides are that they are so easily removed (pumice, dispel), which make them useless against an experienced player..<br>
<br>
Personally I think a dot upgrade is a good idea, stackability will of course be an issue, as you'll be putting either WD, or BoR to the back of our spell books.<br>

<br>
Big fights would last long enough for 2 or 3 WFs, at least, to be cast and take effect.  Because the damage is over time, we avoid the jump in aggro that a DD doing that damage would cause.  It also would be useful in short XP groups, where the fights last often longer than a minute.  It wouldn't be useful for fights that last less than a minute, like full XP groups killing weaker blues or the multiple-group raids where the lead-in mobs are overpowered quickly, but then, no DoT would be.<br>

we have two top line dots now, wd and bor.  why oh why would you replace the higher damage higher level one and keep the lower level lower damage one?  that would be just silly.  look at it as a function of damage over time.  replacing bor instead of wd, our damage would be 387 damage higher per minute.  that adds up over time to be a great deal.<br>
<br>
i know one of the worries would be the resist rate.  whether SOME want to admit it or not, there is a higher resist rate for combo spells, seen both in our own experiences and acknowledged by verant.  fine, then advocate it as a damage only spell with no debuff components.  you can even say you removed the debuffs to act as a &quot;penalty&quot; for it being such high damage.  verant loves penalties, i bet they'd be more likely to go for it then =P<br>
<br>
we've also all acknowledged that there is a serious problem with bor regarding its fizzle rate.  whether they get around to fixing it or not, if verant even acknowledges the problem, replacing it with another fire line dot would help.<br>
<br>
i'm alteration spec, another dot of whichever line will be the same mana-wise to me as long as they are the same efficiency.  however i also realize half of us are evoc spec, so they would get a big bonus from any new dot being from the fire line.  it also makes more sense to use the line that will give 50% of us a mana savings, rather than use the line that will give less about 0.01% of us mana savings.<br>
<br>
then there is also the &quot;we are druids&quot; argument.  we are suppose to be masters of the natural forces, ie fire and cold.  thats why our main nukes are always fire/cold, why we can debuff fire and cold but not the other three, etc.  it makes more sense to me for us to get a fire dot than a magic based dot.<br>
<br>
or.... i would propose a cold dot... but then we'd need a cold debuffer to use with it =P  however this is a novel idea and may get more notice from the powers that be. <p>-K<br>

If you are talking about a spell that does not stack with WD, you are increasing druid DPS by approximately 11 on raids against low resist targets.  Perhaps I am speaking for myself, but upgrading my DPS from 30ish to 40ish on raids is not a high priority for me - particularly since it only applies to ONE druid per raid.<br>
<br>
Soloing, this spell would be essentially useless, except in the "kill this mob ASAP" quest mode.  Most folks will agree that speading mana-free DoTs over additional targets would be more effective than killing a single target quicker for xp-gathering.<br>
<br>
In a normal xp group, mobs aren't going to last long enough to spend 450 mana on them.  Druid rolls in a normal xp group were nicely explained by Lotus - PULL, DRUIDS!  Keep the melees hitting stuff and you've done a great job!<br>
<br>
I suppose I can see that this spell would be useful duoing with a melee, where you get the time to med.  But that makes it another limited use level 60 spell.  I have enough of those.<br>
<br>
I think the druids role in raids and groups would be expanded just as much by removing the snare effect from WoN.  If I really was asking for a level 60 spell, it would be a cold-based copy of RSD. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18>FAQ & Index</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
