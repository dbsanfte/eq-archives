start off my essay by letting you all in on a little known secret.  Thoric is a closet (though not so anymore) homosexual.  He stated to me tonight at dinner that the roof of his mouth was numb from the little balls rolling around in it.  He has also made several statements about wearing pink feather boas.  /shrug, some men!  <br>
<br>
After a LONG 14 hour drive here listening to Thoric bash on me while I sat innocently by listening to my ego get crushed, we finally made it to California.  Those of you who have listened to him talk at length will only be able to begin to imagine the torture 14 hours alone in a car with him were like.  When we got here it was night time but had made plans to visit the beach the next day.  He promised me beautiful weather you know.  Guess what?  A week later, have I seen the beach??? NOOOOOO! You know why?  Thoric lies.  California is apparently deciding to take the sunshine to compensate for it's little energy crisis.  I'm sure he knew about it all along and decided not to tell me.  Bastard.<br>
<br>
The next day Thoric took me to the Improv where he decided to start a disturbing conversation about mutilation, death, and beastiality.  He was so boisterous on his opinions that the people around us slowly started leaving.  Then, he took me out to a karaoke bar where he AGAIN sang Ring of Fire and proceeded to try to get me into a fight.  Afterwards he took me to a strip club.  What kind of guy takes a nice young lady to a strip club?!?<br>
<br>
Saturday we went to Disneyland.  He REFUSED to let me meet Micky Mouse.  Again, no sunshine.  He took me on Splash Mountain, made me sit in front of him so that I would be the one to get wet while he sat back there with a dry ass (I'm certain he needed it for later...)  He made me stand in endless lines, and made me eat clam chowder out of a bread bowl.  Chowder does not belong in bread.<br>
<br>
Later that evening he took me out to yet another bar where he proceeded to get me drunk and then coaxed me on as I made an ass of myself.  It was his fault you know.  <br>
<br>
Sunday, Thoric took me out to what I thought was going to be a nice lunch at a chinese restaurant.  It would have been fabulous had he been able to keep his hands off the waiter.  We then went out to what I thought was going to be a lovely movie about dandelion puffing, called Blow.  Boy was I appaled when I realized it was a movie about drug smuggling.  <br>
<br>
On Monday Thoric and I went to the mall.  When I suggested Starbucks afterwards he made me walk in the freezing cold, because there was no @#%$ SUNSHINE in California, to a place about 1/2 a mile away and then went &quot;oops, there's no Starbucks here, I must have gotten it confused with Jumbajuice.&quot;  So now I had to walk another 1/2 mile back to his car.  Why didn't we drive?  Because he thought I needed to &quot;work off&quot; my lunch.  Of course he then tells me that I will be the only 300 lb woman with no breasts.  After lunch he drove out to some seedy part of town where he made me sit in the car for hours and hours and hours so that he could mutilate himself.  When he realized that he was in the &quot;non-mutilation&quot; part of town, he took me to the right spot.  Later that evening we joined Kemwen for some drinks in San Diego where the two of them discussed the many ways to enjoy fog machines when they moved in with each other and became lovers.  We go to drive home and Thoric pulls over in a truck stop parking lot and falls asleep, I guess I should be glad it wasn't on the road. *cough*<br>
<br>
That brings me to today...We wake up and decide we're finally going to do something nice.  Well, that doesn't happen because Thoric &quot;forgot&quot; his credit card in San Diego.  I'm sure he just needed a chance to go back to visit his &quot;friend&quot;.  We drive back up to LA where he falls asleep and almost gets us killed.  Now I'm being forced to drive in the hellacious Hollywood traffic.  Then he takes me and sits me in a room for 5 hours!!!  I was bored stiff!I had nobody to talk to while he ignored me to talk to everyone else in the room.  Then he sticks me in a chair and has some disfigured man perform ritualistic torture on me for an hour.  He even refused to get me a Barqs!<br>
<br>
Now, in the last hours of my trip he is claiming to never let me return and that he wants to send me home right now.  I think I'm going to cry.  You guy see?  Can you see what he's doing to me?  I think we should all take a lesson from this trip of mine and that is that Thoric sucks...literally and figuratively. <br>
<br>
*Edit*  I forgot to mention that he tried to get me in yet another fight in the parking lot at Fry's with someone who was bigger than me, him and most of the Lakers (who suck ass) basketball team <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> his unsanitary living conditions forced me to be sick all week! <br>

<br>
Well first let me say that if I am indeed gay, Wendy made me that way. She has that effect on guys.<br>
<br>
This is how I remember this vacation:<br>
<br>
First, I drive ALLLLLL the way to Portland to pick her up. I get there at about 11:30 after driving through the podunk redneck hippie ass hinterlands of Oregon. So I pull in knock on her door, and sit there for 15 minutes while she talks on the phone. THEN, I wake up the next day and she tried to freaking poison me! She gave me something she called &quot;Bacon and Eggs&quot; but which I'm sure was some dastardly attempt to put me in a coma so she could use my medical insurance to pay for male escorts. As a result I was violently ill, and our departure was postponed. <br>
<br>
This led to our 14 hour return drive where she relentlessly peppered me with insults and threatened to harm me unless she was allowed to drive. Finally I gave up and turned over the car to her, and she drove like a bat out of hell, probably losing pursuit from the dozens of police officers she passed at mach 7. Finally, through threats and pleading I was able to regain control of my car, whereupon we finished the drive to LA. <br>
<br>
The next day, we go to the Improv, where she decides to shout &quot;Pet love and sexual mutilation!&quot; at the top of her lungs then point at me and say &quot;he did it!&quot; <br>
<br>
We then went out to a bar with my friends. I DIDNT know it was a karaoke bar or we wouldnt have gone.... I'm afraid to admit that I succumbed to temptation and sang ring of fire again... I was much better this time, really. Then as I return to the table a maddened crowd with torches runs by chasing Wende, who has been running around dumping drinks on them and cackling, then announcing she's with the guy in the hawaiian shirt, kick his ass. We quickly left this bar. <br>
<br>
I decided the only place we could take Wende in public and not get in a fight was a strip club. It was the grungiest place I could think of, so I figured she'd be feeling at home. <br>
<br>
Then we woke up the next morning, and Drove to Disneyland. Apparently the folks who called it the &quot;Happiest Place on Earth&quot; didn't plan for Wende. I seem to recall her stepping off the tram and saying &quot;WTF is this crap!&quot; She then proceeded to make fat jokes about innocent girls while standing in line at Splash mountain, attracting her fathers attention, and requiring my diplomacy skills to avoid another Wendy &quot;incident&quot;. I did in fact make her sit in front of me because we were told by Disneyland personnel that this was in fact the proper way to &quot;Load my log&quot;. I'll let you fill in the details there. I then tried to introduce her to fine French cuisine at one of the fine Disneyland restaurants, but her apparent disdain for bread ruined yet another opportunity to introduce her to culture. <br>
<br>
The next day we went to PF Chang's where she apparently offered money to one of the actor/waiters to come on to me repeatedly during lunch. Apparently she doesn't want me entering politics, I believe there were hidden cameras. <br>
We then went to see the fine Johnny Depp drama &quot;Blow.&quot; Wende selected the movie, apparently believing it was Johnny Depp's instruction video to good oral sex. She was dissapointed to discover it was in fact about cocaine. <br>
<br>
Ok, there's no getting around the fact I got lost in Century City, but I SWEAR there used to be a Starbucks there. Wende then used some sort of mind control beam to force me into parking next to a tatoo parlor. After realizing the owner didn't intend to open that day and cooperate with her nefarious plan, she forced me to abscond to Melrose, where she put me at the mercy of some maniacs who branded me with a Latin phrase and poked metal rods through my tongue. The rod has metal balls on the end, thus my comment about numb spots and balls. Of course Wende, being who she is, misinterpreted this. <br>
<br>
Finally, today, not having had enough fun forcing me to mutilate myself, decided to have a go at it herself... While I sat trying to make conversation with my invited guest.... she whips out a BOOK! And not even a good one! Some crap about the unbearable lightness of being!!! Not even pron or anything!!! I mean I would have understood if it was good pron at least. So after making me sit in this miserable room which reminded me of my endless torment the day before, she emerges with some monstrous symbol of satanic power on her arm. It bore three names, Kendra, Alexis, and Aspen... I can only assume these are the spawn of Satan to whom she sold her soul so long ago.... or maybe they are her kids, I don't remember.....<br>
<br>
As if that weren't enough her imperial majesty tells me to go get her a rootbeer! Then abuses me when the store downstairs is out! Man....<br>
<br>
So now tonight I am trying to convince her to take an earlier bus out so I can get rid of her already! Apparently she has some Satanic ritual to get to with the demon she calls Kendra... Or maybe it was a school play, i forget. <br>
<br>
*Edit* Oh yeah, so we're in the parking lot at Fry's to buy her a computer so she can post these scurrilous lies against me, and she runs up to some guy, flicks him off and screams &quot;The guy over there by the Dodge says you are gay and like to recieve!&quot; Then dives into my car and locks the doors, leaving me outside... I ask you what kind of behavior is that? And my room didn't make her sick, its just that Los Angeles has an immune system and is trying to reject her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
