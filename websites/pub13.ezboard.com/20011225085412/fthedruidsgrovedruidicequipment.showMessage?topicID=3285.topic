<br>
When I got the elaborate scimitar, I lost 9 raw AC by putting away my paw...no AC on epic, either. On the other side, I gain 11 WIS (elaborate is 9, epic is 20), and my current wis is exactly 200. <br>
<br>
Some of my other gear is crap, so don't laugh :p<br>
<br>
Some ideas I have come up with: <br>
<br>
Replace plat jasper rings with velium fire opal (-12 wis for +12AC and +130 HP)<br>
<br>
Replace shroud of nature with treeweave (-6 wis for +12 AC, but also -8 FR and CR). I would have loved to already had a Verm tunic, but I've never even seen one drop. <br>
<br>
Replace RyGorr Oracle Shield with SBS (-5 wis and 50 mana for +13 AC) actually, I'd love to do that, but I really can't afford it. SBS is just too expensive for me. <br>
<br>
I can also add more wis at the cost of a little AC...I have a prayer shawl that isn't being used, and am currently using an obulus death shroud. This would increase my wis by 5 while lowering my AC by 5. I would need to get more AC to make up for it, but it would also give me more wis to play with. I would then have 216 wis. <br>
<br>
I really hate selling any of it, because 1) I hate selling, and 2) I like to have the stuff around so I can manuever it, to get the stats I'm looking for. I also have the 46 cleric I am looking out for, too, although getting wis has not really been very difficult, especially when I start going to Hate. Anything I sell, I cut off an option. <br>
<br>
I can get the treeweave for just a few hours time. <br>
<br>
I am also considering looking for new guants, since with the epic, I'll have snare from an item..thoughts on that? For example, just how long is the cast time for the epic effect?<br>
<br>
I'm looking for opinions on all that, and other suggestions I hadn't thought of. <br>

<br>
Prayer Shawl + Treeweave beats Obulus Shroud + SoN in my book, you're trading trading 1 wis, and 8FR/CR away for 7 AC.  I swap a Tattered Mantle (12 ac, some hps) and the Prayer Shawl, depending on the situation.  <br>
<br>
I'm currently looking for Coldain Skin Gloves, a Chetari Shield for a cloak, and a Sarnak Battle Shield.  They're all a tad beyond my budget, but obtainable with the right groups.  You could fight at the Chardok zone for a while and get a shot at a shield in a couple days.<br>
<br>
Keep it all!  Keep your options open.  I find myself swapping my admittedly not-so-uber equipment around for AC, wisdom, resists etc.  (Although, I've heard you can make your guild uber by forcing all the sub-50's to go roleplay, so maybe I'll just take off all the gear worth less than 2k and claim uber status myself.  Doh, that'd leave me with...  Boots.)<br>
<br>
anyway, congrats on your epic!<br>

<br>
I *still* keep Ensnare loaded, although it definitely isn't really needed. <br>
<br>
With the epic, you're going to have 211 Wisdom, so you'll want to try and get as close to 200 as you can. You already state some pretty good alternatives. I think it's oretty important to also look at the circumstances in which you play... for instance, as a raid druid, I tend to concentrate on hp, mana and resists after the 200 wisdom barrier is reached. <br>
<br>
Since it appears to me your primary concern is AC, I would<br>
<br>
1. Replace your SoN with a Treeweave. (-6WIS, -8FR/CR, +12AC) This brings you down to 205 WIS. <br>
<br>
2. Replace 1 Platinum Jasper Ring with a Velium Jasper Ring (+1 WIS)  This brings you up to 206 WIS. <br>
<br>
3. Replace the other Platinum Jasper Ring with 1 Vel. Fire Opal Ring. (-6WIS, +6AC, +65HP)<br>
<br>
This gets you 200 Wisdom and raises your raw AC by 18, and your HP by 65. However, you lose 8CR/FR from the Shroud. This is probably one of the best possible results.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you could also replace the remaining Plat Jasper with a Vel. Jade Ring (+5AC, +30hp, +30mana).<br>
<br>
This would keep your goal of 200 WIS, but only net you a raw AC of 17, hp +30 and mana +30. Again, you lose the 8FR/8CR.<br>
<br>
Another alternative would be<br>
<br>
Diamond Wedding Ring (+2AC, +3 DEX, +5 WIS, +5 INT, +15 MANA, +8FR, +8CR). <br>
<br>
Basically, this ring would make up for the bonuses lost via the Shroud of Nature. If you go with this alternative, I highly recommend you replace the Obulous Death Shroud with a Tattered Mantle. (Yes, odd choice, I know)<br>
<br>
The net result would be 202 Wisdom, +14AC, +15 MANA, +20 HP, no change in your FR/CR.<br>
<br>
In any case, all of these will make up for the lost AC of the Paw...<br>

In fact, they are the equitpment I have had the longest of anything. It think since about level 24. <br>
<br>
I have already had the fire opal rings made, so I will probably start with that. that will leave me at 199 wis, and +12 AC and 110 hitpoints net. I am also still considering swapping the shroud and SoN for prayer shawl and treeweave. Haven't had the time to camp a treeweave, but hopefully, it shouldn't take long. My last Treeweave went to very good use...traded it and 2k for my jade reaver :)<br>
<br>
Thanks to all for the responses. the quest to 1000AC and 200wis continues! <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

<br>
for gloves, something very easy to get is cured tizmak.  you would retain the 9 ac of ES, but add 8 svf and 8 svc.  more than an adequate swap.<br>
<br>
the jasper rings definately need to go, replaced by either the vel jade or vel fire.  you can also do the coldain ring quest up to lvl 8 with only one group needed on occassion, and that is a very very good ring.  replacing your rings with the vel jade means you can also drop the SoN for a treeweave if you dont mind losing the resists without dropping your mana pool much at all (swapping 6 wis SoN for 60 mana rings), and the resists would be negated if you added the tizmak gloves.<br>
<br>
total change from SoN, ES gloves, plat jasper rings to treeweave, cured tizmak gloves, vel jade rings: +22 ac, +10 str, +60 hp, +60 mana at a wis total of 193 with epic (which will also add 90 mana, 10 hp, 10 str, 10 svall).  cost would only be about 1kp for the vel jade rings, as the treeweave and gloves you could get solo.<br>
<br>
i'm really big on resists, so i myself would probably keep the SoN and get the tizmak gloves and vel jade rings.  people place way too much importance on maintaining a 200 wis.  there is no magic wis number you have to keep, and if you can swap out wis for a better item with nearly equivalent mana, then do it.  also depends on your game.  at the high end, resists are what save your life, not any amount of ac.  a dragon who hits for 500 will still hit for 500 if you have 900 ac instead of 860, but their AE may not hit if you have resist of 150 instead of 100. <p>-K<br>
