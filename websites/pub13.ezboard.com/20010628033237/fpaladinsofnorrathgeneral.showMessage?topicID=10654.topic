<br>
I am not the one to use foul language or cry around.<br>
But what I have experienced now during all my plane raids is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I have attended around 15-20 Plane Raids so far. All were either very long, or then with an Uberguild which took the whole zone down (but CT) within 2 hours.<br>
<br>
During ALL those raids I have been either the only Paladin or then the one in charge of the loot rights for us since I have attended most of the raids (we got that kind of credits system, you join raids, you get credits). So whatever dropped for Paladins, was mine.<br>
<br>
I must add we never made it to the second floor of Hate with our Allies. So lets focus on first floor Hate (where I know, Paladin armor is not supposed to drop) and Fear.<br>
I have attended around 10 Fear Raids where we all the time killled all Fetid Fiends.<br>
10 times all fetids (how many are they? 12-15? something like this...).<br>
What I have seen being dropped off those 120-150 Fetid fiends (count around half of them as Male) is:<br>
1 Valorium Bracer, 1 Valorium Boots.<br>
As we all know, the stats of the boots basically suck. AC is bad, Int is bad and so on...<br>
I lost the boots to a friend since I wanted not to waste my Credits for those boots I don't even need. The bracer I lost in a roll since this was a raid with friends where we agreed in rolling.<br>
<br>
Then we had all those Hate raids. Around 70 hours of Plane of Hate and we had NO Paladin drop at all (but the shield for the FD from the thought destroyer). The haunted chests never dropped anything. This is all no biggie since, as I said, Paladin Armor os not supposed to drop on 1st Floor.<br>
<br>
Then I had 2 clearings of Fear with a friendly uberguild on my server. I was the only Paladin and supposed to farm all the Valorium that drops. Finally I could get the armor I was waiting for since a long time, even if its just some minor ones. <br>
2 complete clearings in 16 hours and there weas NO Paladin drop, no valorium and nothing else.<br>
<br>
I once was lucky cause my above mentioned friends did Inny at the same time we were in Hate so they actually got some Val legs and offered them to me. Thanks a lot. My first plane armor. <br>
<br>
So I spent around 160 hours in planes. I saw hundrets of Fetids die, we FULLY epuipped 3 Clerics with Plane armor including BP, we equipped my wifes Rogue Plane Armor inc. BP, I saw Warriors get their full set (all in the time I was there too), I saw mages get their Robes in doubles, I was Chanter Robes, SK BPs, Blightened robes like mad, Blightened caps, all these Ranger and Shaman drops, whatever, everything you can imagine dropped off those guys all in all.<br>
NO Paladin Armor (as I said, besides a bracer and boots).<br>
<br>
Thanks Verant for an incredible hard Epic with a droprate of the Naggy/Vox Books which makes it impossible to get your epic unless you are impossibly lucky or in an uberguild, thanks for makeing us kind of useless (I don't make any damage at all, I see it so often that I do not cause any damage at all, missing, for around 15-20 seconds, fully buffed!), thans Verant for a drop rate of Planar Armor with makes it impossible for me (playing around 5-6 a weekday, double it at weekends) to be in any way similarily equipped than all my friends at same lvl or lower than me. All I can do is stand back and watch my guildies (I am Guild Leader) do their job, once in a while throw in a LH or a stun and then stand back again. You may ask why I stand back being the Paladin dmg shield? No, I don't stand back, but I actually should. Simply because I have a ridiculous unbuffed AC of around 860! My wife is a lvl50 Rogue and has around 100AC more than me. She is the way better meatshield. Same goes for our Warriors, SKs, Monks.. sigh.. Rangers.<br>
<br>
Yes this all is added up by an incredible bad luck in drops and in rolls. But mostly using Ro armor and a Soulfire (or mostly my Ghoulbane so I have a shield to bash) can't just be bad luck with lvl51 and an online time which is close to &quot;geeky&quot;. And no, I don't lvl fast. I have around 65-70 days played.<br>
<br>
Here we go. I do not rant often and I usually take things the way they are. but 2 months of plane raids, efforts, camps like mad, fighting like mad and trying everyhting without any luck at all really really frustrates me! <br>
And I can't even work on my epic... In no way I will ever be able to get the Books off Naggy and Vox.<br>

<br>
Fear seems to be totally random, but at least greaves have dropped and arms and something more each time Ive raided fear for a long time.<br>
<br>
We have had bp to drop each week.<br>
<br>
Sometimes even 2 bp at one raid.<br>

I was the lucky one who got that. But it seems I was very lucky on those drop.<br>
<br>
<br>
For fear ...<br>
I have been to fear 15 times, never seen the paly BP drop. Other drop are common (usually 2 paly by raid)<br>
<br>
<br>
Last hate  raid.... 2 cleric BP drop (as usual...)<br>
<br>
That s very boring. I am sick of seing all those cleric in full plane gear. Why do we have so little drop ? I am still wondering if I will ever get a plane BP.  Verant really should have a look at this problem. I cant believe I will be level 60 soon and still wearing crapy bp..<br>

<br>
I have over 20 played DAYS in fear alone and still dont have a complete set of valorium (not that I give a crap anymore since what I do have is banked)<br>
<br>
You're absolutely right that Valorium drops are hideous, mainly as overcompenstation for the circumstance when fear first opened that had Valorium litteraly raining down from the sky.<br>
<br>
Anyway, point is that while I agree the drop rates stink, what you're seeing is about par for the course.  Most paladins I know that completed a set spent in excess of 50 trips to fear to get it.<br>

Hehe.  We understand where you are coming from.<br>
<br>
But I do have a piece of advice.  Don't spend too much time thinking about planes armor and dragon books.  It will only bring you down.<br>
<br>
Instead, try to concentrate on what you can do to improve your situation.  DW armor is very very easy to get.  With a bit of buying and selling, you can get every piece but the legs and BP.  Add some 6 AC rings, and some decent earrings and you will have as much AC as most warriors that you will meet.  Also, keep an eye out for people selling some of the DN weapons.  The lesser versions are quite common, and I have seen more being sold everyday.  Even the basic 30/39 sword will outdamage your Soulfire by an insane amount.<br>
<br>
I know this is not what you were wanting to hear, but it is what you have to do to stay sane.  /shrug<br>

(w/ exception of me)  We we're going to kill trak soon, so the leader thought I would be set w/ DW BP, but I had to earn the Val BP, and make it fair for the other paladin that was with me in guild.  So that it wasn't like oh this one has and this one hasn't so the weakest link gets to become stronger.  So I worked it out with an old friend to come to thier fear raid, however, when I got there thier we're three other paladins 2 w/ out BP's... of the same guild.  They we're missing alot of the other armor, and I was curious as to why they would even offer me if they we're like that.  We'll day one my GM told me to leave, and I said no I am getting this for me.  Day 2, as figured, a BP dropped, thier was some arguement but I was the only pally who had been thier the full two days, and only needed that peice.  I got a few snide remarks from the other two paladins, but, you know they had become fully equipped in Val in the same trip minus the bp.  Then when it came time for trak, the DW BP we eventually earned was given to the other pally, who had been in the guild longer, and that made me very happy that the choice was easier to make, because we we're then equals equipment wise.<br>
<br>
*shrugs* hehe one of them was the one who found Richious BP first, and the other quit the game.<br>
<br>
In the end tho, thier are better suits of armor now that Velious is out, go get yourself a full suit of Royal Velium, it's heavy, I'll give you that, but it's got high ac and great stats.  Or if Dwarf Killing isn't your tastes, kill in Skyshrine for guardian armor.  Or, if your guild is strong enough you can start working on killing in Kael for Thurgadin Quest armor. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then, either do as the other person said and buy yourself a velium weapon, or go up to hate second floor and have a ranger or monk scout out for the Darkmetal Falchion, it was visible when I killed it for mine.  Then move to the spot where it drops, and get yourself a very nice weapon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>56 Knight

<br>
Hehe, personally, I am in need of a new BP, since the valorium BP is the oldest item I still wear for general use. Although I am at or near the top of the list for a Kael BP, we have yet to see a plate BP (or legs) drop in ToV, although we have gotten multiple chain and leather BPs and silk robes. My guild has little interest in Trak, VS, or the second floor of Hate atm, since they are getting stuff as good or better for virtually all classes (except paladins) in ToV or PoG. <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>

<br>
Totally unfair drop rates between classes, unblanced zones, and a total lack of attention to the problem by Verant.<br>
<br>
Compare drop rates and difficulty between Plane of Growth and Hate, Upper Level.<br>
<br>
Compare drop rates of Cleric, SK, Warrior stuff to that of Paladins, Shaman, Druids.<br>
<br>
They should put their money where there mouth is.  If they keep global stats including drop rates of items, then I challenge them to post the drops of all parts of planar armor for all classes for the last, well, since Velious came out anyway.<br>

Although there does appear to be an element of randomness, it seems pretty clear that leather (used by two classes) and chain (used by three classes) drop far more often than plate (used by five classes). The drop rate of silk (four classes) seems roughly equal to plate. <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>

I guarentee that this is what Verant would say if asked.  PoG and New Hate has similar drop rates.  You can sweep the entire area clear of monsters and only get a hand full of items for any classes.  I myself have been up to Hate 10 times since the changes and I've never ever had a new item drop for Paladins(a couple of new weapons and Druid and Ranger legs have dropped).<br>
<br>
So we've fallen victim to &quot;working as intended&quot; once again and there is probably nothing we can do to fix it short of whining. <p><font size="+1">
