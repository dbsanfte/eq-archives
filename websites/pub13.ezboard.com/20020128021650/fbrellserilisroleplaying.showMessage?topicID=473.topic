<br>
The suddenness of the change caught him off guard.  Bones contorted, skin tingled and stretched as it went from indigo blue to pale white.  The shock sent him falling back, plopping unceremoniously on his butt.   A wet warmth spread around his hind side as the pool of  blood spreading across the floor soaked though his pants.   Minz skittered back, suddenly repelled by what he had done.  Naked feet slipped on the slick boards, and with a thud, he found himself sprawled on the still warm body of Kassy.  <br>
<br>
There was a knock on the door, jarring him out of his sudden remorse.   Instantly, he rolled back.  Bumping into a large potted plant and sending it toppling over.  The clay pot hit the floor boards with a round low thud.  Minz's heart raced.  'Who would be calling on Kassy?' he wondered.  His mind frantically searched for an alibi, or a way out.  But his mind froze.   The knocking came again.   Louder and more urgent this time.   'Where's the back door?' he thought desperately.   <br>
<br>
&quot;This way!  Now!&quot; a voice hissed.  A rogue, one of Hanns' boys most likely.<br>
<br>
Minz didn't pause a moment, diving over top of Kassy, scampering on all fours.  'Amulet!' he thought.  'Kassy must have torn it off.'  Turing back, he quickly crawled back to the body.  &quot;What are ya doin boy?  Lets go!&quot;  The voice was closer now.  Coming from the bedroom he'd occupied only moments ago.<br>
<br>
Another knock, and a young male voice called out.  &quot;Miss Lightborn?&quot;  Minz kept going.  There wasn't any choice.   The amulet was his.  He had to have it.  His hand fell into a puddle of blood, warm and slick.  Reaching out, he felt her body, her leg.  Quickly he felt his way up her torso, searching the fabric of her robe for his amulet.  Fingers brushed across something metal on her chest.  Warm to the touch.  A charm of some sort.  He jerked it hard.   The chain broke easily and he kept searching.  <br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss Lightborn?  Is Everything OK?&quot;  The young voice called.  The latch clicked as the lad tried to open the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now boy!&quot; his ally hissed.<br>
<br>
'There!'  Fingers brushed over his amulet, still clasped in Kassy's hand.  Her fingers still warm and pliable to the touch.  He snatched it and bolted around, running the few steps in a low crouch toward the bedroom<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!  You!  Wha. . . &quot;<br>
<br>
A hand reached out, grabbing Minz by the shoulder and jerking him to his left.  &quot;Idiot!&quot; was hissed into his ear.  And he was shoved hard.   He hit the wall suddenly, fingers grasping on to a shelf or sill of some kind.    Minz's mind whirled.  It all happened so fast.  'Did it really happen?' he asked himself through a haze.   &quot;Through the window boy!!  Are ya daft?&quot;  That was answer enough.  Grasping the sill, he heaved himself up and through the window.  Flattening himself against the alley wall as his feet hit the cobblestones.<br>
<br>
A set of boots hit a street a second after he did.  Something was shoved at him.  His boots, he realized as he was dragged toward the back of the alley.  Shouts and heavily mailed boots could be heard.  &quot;Over the fence you @#%$!&quot;   A split second later, worn wooden planks were in his hand.  He was up and over, barley breaking stride.   His guide grabbed him, pulling him at a solid run.  <br>
<br>
He impacted a body, bouncing off, pumping his feet hard to keep up with his guide.  Obscenities were yelled behind him.  They were in the open now.  The alarm bell peeled loudly.  And they ran faster.  &quot;Pool ahead!  Swim to the bottom Blindy.   Passage is on the right wall.  Ya drown and I'm leavin ya for the fish.  Now!&quot;  A shove to his back urged him to dive.  Minz grit his teeth and threw himself forward, arms outstretched over his head.  Sailing blindly out through the air.  Long seconds passed, seeming to stretch on.  <br>
<br>
Nothing.  <br>
<br>
Not the cold shock of water.<br>
<br>
Not the hard impact of stone.  <br>
<br>
He simply hung there, suspended in mid air.<br>
<br>
Wind ruffled his hair.<br>
<br>
Cold water enveloped him.  For a long frightening moment, he had no idea which way was up and which way was down.  There was no sound, no weight, nothing.  The isolation was truly horrific.  The water exploded next to him as his guide dove into the pool.  Currents washed over him as the other rogue swam downward.  Minz did his best to follow him.  He kicked hard, stroking the water with his one free hand, stretching his hand forward, boots still clenched tightly to his gut.  <br>
<br>
Minz's fingers jammed into the stone floor.  'Right,' he thought.  'To the right.'   Twisting his body in the water,  he pushed toward what he hoped was the passage.  The wall rose up suddenly, but there was no passage way.  His lungs were burning, crying out for oxygen.  Frantically he began to slide to his left, hoping the passage way would present itself. <br>
<br>
Seconds ticked by, and nothing.<br>
<br>
His hand slipped past the wall into emptiness.  Minz darted forward, kicking hard rising upwards.  His head banged the ceiling twice before he burst to the surface.  Coughing and gasping for breath.  The fetid small of the aqueducts wafted through the air.  A hand grabbed his shoulder and pulled him to the wall.  Still coughing, Minz tossed up his boots and hauled himself out of the water.  He leaned back against the wall, trying to catch his breath.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the @#%$ was that!?&quot; his guide yelled.  Echoes of his voice rang down the halls.  Minz just sat panting.  Water dripped down from his hair, slim tingling lines, tracing their way across his face.  &quot;On your feet!&quot;  A hand hooked under his arm, urging him to rise.  <br>
<br>
He struggled up.  His legs were shaky from the exertions. He leaned heavily on the wall, shivering despite the warm damp air.  &quot;Gimme a sec,&quot; Minz said through heavy breaths.  He thrust his hand into his pocket, making sure the amulet made it.  He sighed with relief.  It was there.  Fingers traced over the small silver charm.  The wound in his chest tingled.  He knelt and slipped his feet into his boots.  They were soggy and cold.  &quot;OK,&quot; he said, rising and taking hold of his guide's elbow.  They wound there way through the labyrinth, wading through canals, and crawling through narrow passages to reach their final destination.  Shivers grew to tremors, and he had to clench his fists to keep his hands from visibly shaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Right.  Its one more swim, and we'll be outside the walls.  You can rest there.  the passage is easy.  It?s a narrow passage, so you'll be fine.  Strait down, a turn and strait back up.  You'll be in the hidden chamber North of the gates.  Got it?&quot;  Minz nodded.  &quot;Wait 'til night?err wait for about an hour or so, and then head out.  Getcherself away from here.  You were seen, and you'd best put some serious distance 'tween you and Qeynos.  Here's 20 pieces.&quot;  The rogue took his hand and placed a purse in it, closing his fingers about the leather.  &quot;Go to the druids ring and pay off some tree-hugger.  Don't go to the wizard's spires.  The guards'll be lookin for ya.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He nodded again wearily.  &quot;Right, in ya go.&quot; Minz felt the edge of the pool with his foot.  Realizing only now that he'd lost his harpoon.  He sat down, slipping feet first into the pool.  &quot;Strait down, turn and up.  Got it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Got it,&quot; he muttered hoarsely.  Taking a deep breath, he hopped forward, sliding his butt off the stone floor and into the pool.  Kicking his feet to keep above water.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said, not sure if his guide was still there.  Tucking his legs, he somersaulted in the water, plunging down.  The passage was indeed narrow, and he surfaced on the other side without any trouble at all.  Quietly breaking the surface and pulling himself onto dry land.  The sounds of young adventurers practicing their skills could be heard through the vine covered entry way.  Minz sat in the corner, shivering.  Trying to push the memory of the past half hour out of his mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
A rustle of leaves snapped his attention.  Darkness.  A moment of confusion faded away as his predicament came rushing back.  Darkness was the norm.  But he still hadn't gotten used to it.  That he was blind was a fact of life now.  But a fact that he hated.  And therefore never accepted.  It was still a shock every time he awoke to the perpetual darkness.  And just as great a shock when he awoke to light.  <br>
<br>
Minz laughed to himself ruefully.  'To see light, I have to become darkness,' he pondered.  The wound on his chest twinged.  This was really the first he had considered the changes taking place.   'To take it into me and make it part of me.  Yet to remain in the light, I have be in the dark.  It's more than just vision,' he thought.  'More than just my body changes.'<br>
<br>
&quot;You must become a Teir'dal,&quot; he muttered.  Repeating dark lady's words with a sudden understanding.  <br>
<br>
The twinge in his chest had become more insistent.  More intense.  His hand slid into his pocket, unconsciously grasping the amulet.   His head snapped down.  Useless eyes staring at the enchanted spider charm in his hand.   He clenched his fist around it squeezing it in fury, a snarl slashed across his face.  &quot;I am not drow!&quot; he hissed.   Laughing echoed<br>
in his head.  Images flashed through his mind.  <br>
<br>
Kassy, lying in a pool of blood.  <br>
<br>
The elf in Paineel with his neck snapped.<br>
<br>
The dinner of wood-elf.<br>
 <br>
'Run!'  It was more of a primal urge than a thought.  Fleet feet putting distance between himself and his problems.  'Run!'  He was on his feet, but off balance from rising too quickly.  Arms whirled about, and the world tilted sideways as he tumbled down.  Landing solidly on the earthen floor.  &quot;Ooooofff!&quot;  He scrambled to his feet, placing his hands flat against the wall for support, keeping both hands in contact with the solid stone.  It was damp and gritty to the touch.  Minz fought to keep himself in check, walking on the edge of panic.   &quot;Gotta get outta here!&quot; he muttered.  Sidestepping his way around the room, keeping hold of the wall. <br>
<br>
Mortar and stone crumbled away under his hands as he felt for the vine covered opening.  Finally, the stone ended, and the door presented itself.  Minz paused, listening intently.  Not a sound could be heard, save the breeze rustling the trees.  Turning, he leaned his back against the wall.  He held the amulet in his hand, running his fingers over its shape.  'I should use it.  To see,' he thought.  'No!  Don't you see what its doing to you?' he answered.  <br>
<br>
'It saved your life fool. . .'<br>
<br>
'It's taking your life.  Everything that?s dear to you, that?s important is being sapped away by this vile thing.'<br>
<br>
'If it weren't for this,' he clench his hand around the spider amulet. 'Everything you are would be gone.  Dead.  At least now you're alive.  And who says what you're becoming isn't better?'<br>
<br>
'I am no drow!'  He yelled in his mind, squeezing the amulet hard.  Its needle like legs biting into his flesh, pricking his skin.  He could feel the warm droplets of blood rising to the palm of his hand.  <br>
<br>
It moved.<br>
<br>
The tiny motion jolted his nerves.  The tiny pinprick suddenly the focus of his entire consciousness.  Slowly he opened his hand.  He could almost feel the droplets of blood being pulled from the callous groves etched in his hand.  <br>
<br>
It was sucking?feeding.  Its slender body so still, yet clearly animated.  He could feel it.<br>
<br>
Quicker than he thought possible, the spider darted up his arm.<br>
<br>
Minz cried out a moaning start of repulsion, hands involuntarily trying to brush off the intrusive insect.  But the spider was under his sleeve.  <br>
<br>
As suddenly as it began, it stopped.<br>
<br>
The spider froze, falling away from his arm, resting upside down in the fold of his sleeve. <br>
<br>
Inert.<br>
<br>
He shook his arm, jiggling the amulet down to his wrist.  Gently wrapping his fingers about the silver amulet, and removing it from the cuff of his tunic.  Careful not to draw blood with its spine-like legs.  <br>
<br>
The implications of what just happened ran through his mind. 'It could actually move independently?and it feeds off me?' he thought.  'Throw it now,' he yelled at himself.  But he couldn't.  It was like an urgent need to him.  To hold it, to feel it, to use it.  It felt like a fire, tongues of flame licking at him.  Compelling him to plunge the spider to his chest.  Almost engulfing him.<br>
<br>
The rogue shook his head violently.<br>
<br>
Minz thrust the amulet into his pocket.  It was still silent outside.  'Even with my harpoon, it was a hard trek blind.  But without it?  No!  I am not a drow.  Can't walk on path,' he thought.  'To many guards  But how the hell am I going to know where I am otherwise?' <br>
<br>
He took a deep breath, scratched at the wound in his chest and ducked through the vines.  He paused a moment outside, remembering the scene.  The main gate and guards to his left.  Farms to his right.  And strait ahead, the plains of Karanna.  He ducked low, and began a smooth quick gait across the empty field that surrounded Qeynos.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ouch!&quot;  Minz fell backwards ungracefully.  Plopping down hard on his rump.  It was the third time, he'd run into a tree.  Worst part was that he could still hear Qeynos behind him.  Sighing in frustration, he just sat a moment, rubbing the large bump his forehead.<br>
<br>
&quot;You OK mister?&quot;  <br>
<br>
The little voice startled him.  &quot;Huh!?&quot; his hands shot to the hilts of his blades, and relaxed jst as quickly.  &quot;Ohh, yea, I'm fine.&quot; Minz muttered, tilting an ear in the child's direction.  It was a boy.  Not much older than 6, if human.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mister?  Why doncha jus not run into the trees?&quot; The boy piped.<br>
<br>
The child's simplistic solution  made him smile.  He leaned toward the youngster whispering in a conspiratorial manner.  &quot;I think they're out to get me.  The things keep jumping in front of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The boy laughed.  &quot;Nuuuhh uhhh!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really,&quot; Minz replied with all gravity.  &quot;They're crafty things.&quot;<br>
<br>
The boy snuffed in protest.  &quot;I saw ya walk into 'em all free times.  And you bumped into them!  Hmmmph!&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz snickered to himself.  &quot;Okokok, ya got me.  I bumped into them.  But they're still crafty ya know.  And,&quot; Minz took a deep breath, &quot;I am blind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Blind?&quot; he could almost hear the boy @#%$ his head in curiosity.  &quot;Whasat?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It means I can't see cuz my eyes don't work right.&quot; Minz answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;And dats why you're bumpin into the trees?&quot; the boy asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep!  That?s why,&quot; he said.  &quot;Now what are you doing out so late?  And so far from the guards?  There are nasty things out here ya know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya mean like that bag o ' bones you're sitting next to,&quot; the boy said.  Minz started, reaching for his blades.  Sending his small companion into fits of giggling.  &quot;Madeyalook! Madeyalook!&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz couldn't help but laugh.  &quot;So what are you doing out so late lad?  Won't your mom and dad be worried?&quot;  The boy's tummy growled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not supposed to be home tonight.&quot; he muttered.  &quot;Mom is having friends over.  I can come back in the morning she said.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Friends?&quot; Minz asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yea,&quot; he mutter <br>
<br>
The realization came to him in a rush.  His mom was probably a prostitute.  Minz sighed, reaching out and ruffling the boy's hair.  It felt greasy to the touch.  Fine filaments, probably bond, clumped together.  &quot;Ya hungry buddy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhh huh!&quot; was the ragamuffin's quick response.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell ya what: you protect me from the fiendish trees and help me get to the plains and I'll make ya dinner.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright! Come on!&quot;  Minz felt his hand snatched out of the boys hair and virtually yanked out of its socket.  Minz was hauled to his feet and they began to trot off.  The boy only banged him into a tree once.  Forgetting that Minz was a bit taller than he.  The impact did manage to open a nice gash on his forehead though.  Nothing big, but a small stream of blood trickled down his forehead now.  <br>
<br>
Finally, the hills flattened out.  The twosome were just on the outskirts of the plains.  &quot;Here ya go mister!  Now what's for dinner!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz squared his shoulders and puffed out his chest.  Placing a make believe white linen over his crooked arm and answered in his best 'snotty Erudite waiters' voice, &quot;Hmmmmm, well tonighte's men-hew includeez feresh brais-ed rabbit, served over wild greens and a half-a-ling patee.&quot;  Minz could almost hear the boy crinkle his nose.  Smiling mischievously.  &quot;Ohhhoho! Le chef has jus inform-edd moi that the half-a-ling is vary fresh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eeeeewwwww!&quot; the boy said loudly.  Minz couldn't help giggling<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever hunted rabbits?&quot; Minz asked the lad.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Uuummmm no.&quot; he answered.  &quot;Why doncha just buy one?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't spend much time outside the city huh?&quot;  Minz asked.  There was a small rustle of fabric.  Shaking his head Minz presumed.  &quot;Well, we're gonna do it the old fashion way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We are?&quot; the boy gulped as he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure, you and I are gonna git us-uns some rabbit!  Now first thing me need is some mud.  You see any about?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mud?&quot; the boy asked incredulously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.  Mud?you know?wet dirt.&quot;  Minz answered, now seriously doubting the boy had ever been outside the city.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what it is mister,&quot; he answered to Minz's relief.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, then find some.  Bring back a hand full.&quot;  The boy ran off.  The mud wasn't really necessary, but for a kid, it was probably the most fun part of it.  After a short spell, tramping footsteps could be heard running back.  The smell of icky soft loam drifted ahead of the scampering boy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its this 'nuff?&quot; he asked.  Minz reached out, feeling the boy's small cupped hands. <br>
<br>
&quot;Perfect,&quot; he replied.  Minz sat down and dug though his pack, feeling around for the tight bundle of cord.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha'd do I do with it?&quot;  The boy asked impatiently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hang on?almo?ahhh here it is.&quot; Minz said, removing a mass of fine strings.  &quot;OK, this is a net, we're gonna spread it out and lay a carrot on it?  When the bunny hops on for a nibble,&quot; Minz made a silly bunny hopping movement that brought giggles bubbling out of the boy.&quot; you pull it shut, and ZAP!  Dinner is served.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what's the mud for?&quot; the boy asked.<br>
<br>
Minz leaned close, pretending to glance around conspiratorially and whispered. &quot;Ya see those wascally wabbits have a really good sense of smell.&quot;  Minz wiggled his nose.  &quot;So we fool 'em by smearing mud all over ourselves.  That way, they smell the mud.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ooohhhhhh!&quot;  the boy said as if everything in the universe finally made sense.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, I want you to smear the mud all over your arms, hands, neck and face,&quot; he said.  The words had hardly passed his slips when he heard the sticky smacking noise of mud being applied liberally to the boy's body.  He told the youth to set the trap near a tree and how to lay out the net, cover it with leaves.  Minz puled a carrot out of the bag, and held it out to him.  &quot;OK, there ya go.  Go catch us a wascally wabbit!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aren't you??  I?&quot;  The boy stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go on!&quot; Minz encouraged him.  &quot;You can do this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OK,&quot; the boy replied hesitantly.  <br>
<br>
Turning to head out.  Minz reached out and smacked him on his bumm.  &quot;Now GIT! Them rabbits will be goin to bed soon.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hey!&quot; the boy shouted back.  But he was running off.<br>
<br>
Absent mindedly, Minz picked at the dried blood on his face.  Scratching it clean, and accidentally making his forehead bleed again.  &quot;Damn,&quot; he muttered.  Reaching in his pocket for a rag to hold to his forehead.  Fingers rummaging past the small folding skinner's knife, the amulet and a few coins before finding the rag.<br>
<br>
Minz leaned back on a rock, holding the rag to his head.  Head wounds always bled a lot.  A high pitched &quot;Wooot!&quot; seemed to sail across the air.  Dinner was almost here.<br>
<br>
The boy came sprinting in.  &quot;I got one! I got one!&quot;  He was breathless, sputtering out excited words in one unending stream of enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well come on boy?lets have the beast,&quot; Minz said, holding out his hands and the boy settled the net onto his palms.  The bunny quivered in its snare.  &quot;You caught us a fat 'un young man.  Nice goin!&quot;   Minz set the net on the ground.  The hare momentarily tried to scurry away, but was trapped but the net.  He wrapped the cord around the top of the net, securing any chance of escape the rabbit had.   He stroked the rabbit softly, running his palm from its head to its cotton tale.  The placing a reassuring hand on the rabbits back, he scratched the furry creatures ears.  <br>
<br>
The crack was sudden, and the boy let out a horrid moaning gasp.  Minz's head shot up at the boy.  Glassy eyes gazing in his direction.  Startled that the young boy would react so.  &quot;Ummm, I'm sorry?you know you never told me your name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Meff,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well sorry Meff.  I guess you never seen how to snap a rabbit's neck have you?&quot;  There was a slight rustle of skin against fabric.  The shaking of a small head.  &quot;I don't suppose you'll want to watch me gut and skin it then?&quot;  More head shaking.  &quot;OK, why doncha go gather some more firewood then.<br>
<br>
The boy scampered off.   Minz wondered if the lil guy, Meff, knew where mutton came from.  Shaking his head, he reached in his pocket, for the lil skinning knife.  A cloud of guild passed by him as his fingers brushed the amulet.  Pulling out the knife, Minz removed the hare from the netting and began to ready the animal for cooking.  He cut deeply along the animals centerline, extending a slice up each limb.  He pulled the creatures innards out, tossing them aside, and began to remove the rabbit's pelt.  By the time Meff got back, with what sounded like an arm full of wood, Minz had the rabbit skewered and ready to cook.<br>
<br>
The firewood toppled the ground with a clatter.  The wood sounded green.  He sighed, hoping some of it would burn.  Minz hefted each piece in turn, tossing dry wood in one pile and green in another.  It wasn't as bad as he thought.  Much of the wood was just fine.  &quot;Ya ever made a fire Meff?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nuh uhh.  Mom says I shudna play with fire,&quot; Meff said emphatically. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well? &quot; Minz paused, trying to find some reason, any reason really, why this would be OK with the boy's mom.  &quot;you could eat the rabbit raw.&quot;  Minz swing the dangly skinned rabbit in front of the boy's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eeewwww!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Minz laughed as the boy recoiled in disgust.  &quot;Think we should cook it then?&quot;  Silence hung in the air.  &quot;Well then I suppose ya should light the fire.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But..but I dunno how?&quot; Meff protested.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here, I'll help.&quot;  Minz smiled, feeling about for a few pieces of wood to make the pyramid structure.  &quot;See like this.  Now, take this knife, &quot; He held out a small sharp single edged work knife. &quot;and make some thin wood shavings and a few splinters.  Understand?&quot;  He heard a faint rustle of fabric.   &quot;Can't hear you nodding boy.  Blind, 'member?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh, yea..sorry, yessir..I unerstand.&quot;  Meff said haltingly.  Meff took the blade and the sound of a clumsy blade biting into wood filled the silence.  &quot;Ouch!&quot;  The knife fell to the dirt with a soft thump, and Meff could be heard sucking his self inflicted wound.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come 'ere.&quot; he said to the boy. &quot;Let me see it.&quot;  The boy mumbled, scooting closer to him.  Minz took the boys small hand in his.  He had long, slender fingers.  Almost delicate.  'Bit of elf in him,' he thought.  The bleeding was coming from a gash on the last knuckle of his thumb.  &quot;Took a chunk outa it didnya?&quot;  Meff nodded.  The bleeding wasn't too bad, but the poor guy was shaking.  &quot;Ohhhh this ain't nothin.  Well getcha bandaged up right quick.&quot;  Minz wrapped a small bandage over the wound, wrapping the lacings snuggly around his wrist and upper hand.  &quot;You were cutting towards yourself weren't ya?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; said the young boy, voice no longer quavering.<br>
<br>
&quot;Always cut away from you,&quot; Minz said raising an eyebrow at the lad.  &quot;Now, I want you to pile up the kindling underneath the logs there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kindling?&quot;  Meff asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;The lil pieces of wood.  Make a lil pile of splinters and shavings right here.&quot;  Minz said as he felt his way to the center point under the pyramided logs.  Minz heard the boy sweeping the kindling into his hand and reaching into the pile.  &quot;Done?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh.&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, Now watch what I do.&quot;  Minz dried his blood covered hands with a rag from his pocket, stuffing it back and pulling two stones from another pocket near his hip.  He held the stones up for the boy to see, and then lowered them to the pile of logs.  With a quick motion, he struck one stone to another, glancing the blow toward the kindling.  &quot;Do you see the sparks?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh huh?how's that?why?&quot;  Meff stuttered out half questions.<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly, I don't know, but it works,&quot; Minz answered handing the stone to Meff.  &quot;Now you try.  Aim the sparks toward the edges of the kindling.  And once you see it start to smolder, blow on it very lightly.&quot;  Soon a light burning smell wafted in the air.  &quot;Ok, go ahead?&quot;  Meff blew hard, and Minz sighed.  &quot;Blew it out didn't ya?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea.  Sorry.&quot;  Meff answered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its OK.  Make you pile again, start trying to light in and blow lightly this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OK,&quot; the boy answered.<br>
<br>
In a moment or two, smoke rose again and Meff could be heard exhaling lightly over the wood.  &quot;Do you see little flames?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; Meff replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good job,&quot; Minz said encouraging the boy.  &quot;Now place a few small twigs on it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Its going! Its going!  I did it!&quot; Meff exclaimed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye Meff.  Great job.&quot;  Minz mussed up the boys hair.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Uuuhhh, here are your rocks back mister.&quot;  Meff said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Keep 'em.  You never know when you'll need them.&quot;  Minz said.  He plunged the steaks for his makeshift spit into the soft earth, and hung the skewered rabbit over the growing flame.    <br>
<br>
&quot;Mom won't like it.  That I have 'em.&quot;  Meff said.  His voice edged with guilt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its OK bud.  Just don't tell her.&quot;  Minz said winking a blind eye at the youth.  The fire crackled and popped softly as they added wood.  Soon the rabbit began to sizzle on the spit.  The sweet smell of its flesh made Minz's mouth water.  The breeze blew lightly, carrying just a hint of the lush smell of the nearby river.  The air was cool and crisp, but the fire kept them comfortable.  For a few moments, as he and Meff munched on the tender rabbit, he forgot who he was and why he was out here.  He heard a small movement, and felt something brush against him.  Meff laid his head down on his lap.   Minz brushed the boy's hair out of his face.  Smiling to himself as he laid down next to him, an arm draped protectively over the lad's shoulder.<br>
<br>
<br>
The dawn shone bright in his eyes, rousing him from the light sleep.  The fire had burnt down, and the boy felt oddly cold next to him.  Minz blinked the sleep from his eyes.  His mouth felt ?felt crusty.  <br>
<br>
A cloud passed in front of the sun.<br>
<br>
But it wasn't a cloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;A bit thirty last night dark brother?&quot;  The voice was silky smooth. <br>
<br>
Minz looked down before him.  Meff's throat was open wide.  Died blood crusted around the gaping wound.  His blue hands covered in the boys young blood.  <br>
<br>
It was like a snap in his head.<br>
<br>
It all made sense.<br>
<br>
The boy had to die.<br>
<br>
And he had drank his blood.<br>
<br>
Minz licked his lips.  Tasting the bitter iron of the dried blood.  <br>
<br>
There'd be no more fighting it.  No more hiding.  No more running from who he was.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Tier 'Dal,&quot; he said to the tall female Tier 'Dal before him.  <br>
<br>
She smirked and whirled her arms about her, calling on the fathers will to protect him.  &quot;I am Morrigita.  We should move.  'Tis not safe here for us.&quot;<br>
