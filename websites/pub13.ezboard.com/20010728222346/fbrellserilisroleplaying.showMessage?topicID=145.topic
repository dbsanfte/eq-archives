The eyes were used for medicines and it was satisfying to see a child so young working with such diligence.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What's yer name, child?&quot;  she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Caedusia.  Caedusia Talisman.&quot;   the little girl answered with pride.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're workin' very hard, Caedusia.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My mommy's sick and my daddy has to take care of her so I get to provide our supper.  If I take 15 beetle eyes to the baker, he'll give us a big meat pie for supper.&quot;  Caedusia beamed a smile of pride.  And rightfully so.  Not many children her age got to provide for their families and Caedusia knew this made her special.  <br>
<br>
Caedusia had never been like the other children.  She was serious and withdrawn, even before her mother's illness had devastated the family.  The other children teased her and life was much easier now.  She was happy.  She was useful.  And she knew that the she was helping make the medicines that would help other mommies.  <br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline smiled at the child.  Such an endearing quality.  &quot;I know your mommy.  In fact, I am on my way to see your daddy right now to pray for her.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Rodcet Nife'll heal her.  I know it.&quot;  Caedusia smiled and saw a beetle running past. &quot;Excuse me. I gotta go kill that.&quot;  She ran to club it gently with her hammer so she didn't damage the eyes.<br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline continued into the city and looked for the bright yellow clapboard home of the Talisman's.  She didn't need her eyes to guide her through the streets for the stench of near death permeated the surrounding air.  Sammeline clucked her tongue.   Caedusia's had been a very difficult birth and Esmira had never fully recovered.  A mild infection set in and was controlled for a few years, but finally her body just couldn't fight it any further.  The healers had done all they could.   The only hope was divine intervention.  <br>
<br>
She knocked on the door of the clapboard home and Taman answered.  Handsome beneath the week's stubble, his deeply ringed eyes and slouched stance showed the worry and exhaustion that were taking their toll.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Sister Sammeline, good of ye to come.&quot;  He opened the door and admitted her into the dimly lit anteroom.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Any change?&quot; the sister asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Only for the worse, sister.  Only for the worse.&quot;  Tears welled in Taman's eyes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;'Tisn't over yet, brother.&quot;  Sister Sammline said, reaching out and squeezing Taman's hand.  &quot;We must never give up hope.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taman sighed.  &quot;I fear hope's gone and given up on us, Sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
Changing the subject to one less grim, Sister Sammeline said,  &quot;I bumped into your daughter on the way here, Taman.  She's a remarkable child.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes she is.  I couldn't survive without her.&quot;  Taman smiled thinking of his dark-eyed child.<br>
<br>
&quot;She said the most intersting thing.  She's convinced that her god will heal her mother.  And it got me to thinkin', Taman.  Out of the mouths of babes.&quot;  Sister Sammeline stared off into space briefly as though aware of another presence in the room.  &quot;Out of the mouths of babes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taman shuffled his feet.  &quot;Well, do ye wish to see Esmira?&quot;  Taman asked, opening the door to the bedroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes.  And, brother, get some rest.  I'll watch over her for a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank ye, sister.  I am sure I could use some.&quot;<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Caedusia walked down the street with intense concentration making sure that the large meat pie she was carrying didn't totter or spill.  She ignored the taunts of the boys splashing in the pond and refused to dignify their questions with a response.  When she got to her door she used her foot and the hard sole of her shoe to knock.  Sister Sammeline opened the door for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;My that's a big pie ye earned today, Caedusia,&quot; the sister said taking it from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I didn't spill a single drop!&quot; Caedusia said with pride.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I see that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's Daddy?&quot; Caedusia asked as she looked around the anteroom.<br>
<br>
&quot;He's restin', child.  I told him I'd watch your mother awhile.  Now, shall I cut ye a big piece o' this pie.  I think you've certainly earned an extra helping with all your hard work.&quot;  The sister set the pie on the table and looked in the pantry for a knife.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, no!  I always feed mother first.&quot;  Caedusia answered.  <br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline smiled.  &quot;Your mother's resting, now.  But if you'd like,  you may go wake her up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye think I should?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think maybe it'd be better to let her rest.  She's painfree now, in her sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay.&quot;  Caedusia looked a little saddened and then suddenly remembered her manners.  &quot;Will you share supper with us, sister.  There's lots.  Baker always gives me the biggest pie.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It'd be an honor, Caedusia.&quot;  Sister Sammeline handed Caedusia two plates and forks and Caedusia laid them out on the table.  The sister cut the pie and served Caedusia a large helping and herself a very small one.  She looked into the pitcher to find milk there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this milk fresh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, Caedusia answered.  &quot;Briltok brings us a fresh pitcher every morning on his way to market.  I collect clover for his cow whenever I'm off in the hills and we trade.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline poured Caedusia a large glass of milk and sat it next to the pie.  Caedusia sat down and started to pick up her fork.  The sister coughed slightly.<br>
&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Caedusia put the fork down and bowed her head.<br>
<br>
Sister Sammline said the shortest grace she could think of.  &quot;Father Nife, we thank you for the bounty you share with us tonight.  Amen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia dug into her plate with the eagerness of an abandoned puppy tasting its first table scraps.   Sister Sammeline took a small bite, never taking her eyes off the child.  When Caedusia stopped eating long enough to take a large swallow of milk, Sister Sammeline asked, &quot;Do you remember the parable of the second son, Caedusia?&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia nodded and finished swallowing.  &quot;The second son jumped in front of the bear to save his older brother.  And now he's exalted above all men and sits at the feet of  Father Nife.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right. The second son sacrificed his life for his brother.  Do you think that is what Rodcet Nife is waiting for to heal your mother, maybe?  Someone to sacrifice for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia thought a moment.  &quot;But mother's not being eaten by a bear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, she isn't, child.  But there're other ways, Caedusia,&quot; Sister Sammeline answered.  &quot;Would you give your life to Rodcet Nife in exchange for your mother's?&quot;<br>
<br>
Taman entered the room, bleary eyed.  &quot;What yer talking to the child about, Sister?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline stood up and offered Taman her seat.  &quot;Let me get you some pie, Taman.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Forget the pie.  Tell me what yer gettin' at.  I heard you talkin' 'bout sacrifice.  Now don't be puttin' foolish notions in the girl's head.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;'Tis not a foolish notion.  Her life for Esmira's.  It's the way.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll hear none of it,&quot; Taman erupted.  <br>
<br>
Caedusia watched the grown-ups.  She'd never heard her father raise his voice and the Sister looked mean all of a sudden.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You'll hear of it, Taman Talisman.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go take your plate outside, Cae. The sister and I have a few words ta say and they're not for a child's ear.&quot;  Taman  picked up Caedusia's milk and carryied it for her as she took her plate and sat on the stoop.   Caedusia put her ear to the door and listened.<br>
<br>
&quot;We been over this, sister.  This ain't no curse o' Nife's.  It's an infection, pure and simple.&quot;  Taman asserted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye got yer wife with child too young, Taman.  Everyone told ye so but ye wouldn't listen.  An now Rodcet is teachin' ye what it means to go agin' the church.&quot;  Sister Semmeline said emphatically.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well an' it be too late now.  Ye want t'believe it's a curse, I canna stop ye.  But ye'll leave the child out of it.&quot;  Taman said, sitting down to his supper.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yer a blind fool and always have been, Taman Talisman.  Sacrifice is the way healin's always been done.  One life for another.  If you give this child to Nife, he'll heal Esmira.  I'm as certain of it as I am me own nose.&quot;  Sitting next to him at the table, Sister Semmeline softened her tone.  &quot;It's her only hope, Taman.  She's not much longer fer the world an nothing any of the healer's can do.&quot;  Sister Semmelin reached out and grabbed Taman's arm.  <br>
<br>
Taman ate in silence, staring at his plate.  When he finished, he drank a large swig of milk from the pitcher.  &quot;An Esmira'll be able to bear more youngun's?&quot;  he finally asked.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Rodcet Nife doesn't half heal, Taman.  You've witnessed it before.  Remember Mauden Flipcit.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, no one thought he'd walk after the what the gnolls did ta 'is leg..  Nife fixed 'im up like new, he did.  Can't argue with that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you'll give up the child?&quot;  the sister asked somberly.<br>
<br>
&quot;If she'll go, you can take 'er.  Rodcet knows all I wants is me Esmira back.  An' if she can bear me a passel of youngun's, why, 'twill be worth the loss.  Now I better go an' check on me wife.&quot;  Taman stood and headed into the bedroom.  <br>
<br>
Sister Semmeline cleared Taman's plate, went outside and sat down on the stoop next to Caedusia.  &quot;So child.  Would ye be like the second son.  Do ye wish t'be exalted above all women.  Will ye give yer life for your mother?&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia stood up and took her plate inside.  &quot;I'll just get me things,&quot; she said.  &quot;An may I say good-bye to me mother?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sister Sammeline shook her head.  &quot;I think it would be best if you didn't, child.  'Tis not a thing she'd have you do.  She's a good woman, that one is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Caedusia grabbed her pack.  She didn't have much.  Just a small tunic, her hammer, and an old sheild one of the guards had given her when he saw her heading out into the hills.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Will it hurt much?&quot; Caedusia asked as she took the sister's hand and headed bravely toward the temple.<br>
