Well I know my faction is fine and I tried to do this part of the quest. I give the coin to Athele and get the necklace. Then I track down Sionae and give it to her. She tells me to find Nuien and she meet me at the meeting place and suddenly EVERYONE disappears. Athele is gone, Sionae is gone and Nuien never appeared. Well you can imagine my shock and dismay! I had my whole guild there waiting to help me kill the corruptor only to have the wenches depop? Of course I petitioned and the answer I got the first time was &quot;So Sorry, Too Bad. We can't re-spawn them. You have to start all over.&quot; and the answer I got the second time was I was too danged low in level to even start my quest but this GM couldn't tell me what level I needed to be to start it. I'm level 39. I know I have to be 51 to complete it but to start the first of MANY parts? Come on! Has anyone else had this problem?

<br>
A) why you would want to do this part of the quest before you can even contribute to the killing of the DE corruptor and can only surmise that - and this is a total guess - your guild happens to have a few spare VS stones laying around and are willing to twink you an Ornate Scimitar - or better yet - get the youngest possible druid with an epic just to say they did.. If I'm totally off with this guess - don't take offence<br>
<br>
B) why your guildmates would help a lvl 39 druid on a lvl 50ish epic encounter - we had druids lvl 49 - 50ish looking to do this encounter in our guild and they were met with silence in guildchat.  <br>
<br>
There is no reason to do this encounter so young as it doesn't do you any good until you can get a VS stone... VS stones - at least in my guild - are reserved for lvl 53+ druids and rangers.  Get a few levels and try it again. <p>Samita Littlethorn - Preserver<br>

The corrupter is level 45 and a level 39 druid can contribute to the fight. Either with heals or nukes.<br>
<br>
B: My guild would help ANYONE that wanted help as long as it's something they can contribute to the fight. My guild has helped a 44 druid do thiers as a matter of fact and the corrupter conned yellow to her. The VS Stones in my guild also are reserved for the higher level druids and rangers, but if someone wants to get this portion out of the way then more power to them.<br>
<br>
C: The original poster just came here asking for information, not asking to be berated for being too low of a level. Lets keep to information and try not to make anyone feel inferior. <br>
<br>
<br>
As to the original poster. I am not sure what could have happened to your druids, but it must have been a bug. Unfortunately it looks like you need to start over like a few of us others had to a few times when we were first discovering the quest. :(  Good luck.<br>

I CAN contribute to that part of the quest And did for 2 other members of my guild. So now it was my turn and they were there to help me out. We had decided to spend the entire week helping people do what ever parts of their epics they needed done. (I actually helped with the cleric quest and the plasmatic priest, don't knock the lower levels) This happened to be a part that 2 of us druids a 1 ranger all needed to do. Everything worked fine for them but got buggy on my turn. So now I'm back to that part and we're thinking of trying it again but we wanted to be sure there wasn't some &quot;level cap&quot; reason I couldn't do it. Heck then I'm getting back to foraging and killing and waiting till I'm much higher to finish it. My Guild, Pain Mercenaries of Silence on The Rathe, prides itself on not being an &quot;uber&quot; guild and on helping people till we get annoying :) so this wasn't about &quot;he who has the fastest quest wins&quot; but rather &quot;Hey! We're all here why not.&quot; <br>
As for the other part. Yes we have the loc of the spawn of the corrupter but the other PH's depopped mid quest and that was the confusing part. <br>
So I restate my question: Does anyone know of an in-game reason I can't start the quest now? My faction is good and all I can think is if there is a level cap I'm not aware of. Yes I have petitioned and the Guides are as confused about it as I am. <p>Pain Mercenaries of Silence<br>

&quot;You need luck to meet the full druid gathering after another druid or ranger did that part successfully.&quot;  Level limit doesn't seem to matter, my guild helped me get the tome at level 49, and it was indeed there for me.<br>
<br>
I think that you were just one of the unlucky few that hit up Reaver Hill very soon after someone else completed that portion of the quest, thus screwing up spawn times, and the gathering never happened, and the Reaver did not spawn.<br>
<br>
Don't be frustrated.  You are very early in the quest, and have a lot to accomplish.  Getting back to this part of the quest isn't terribly hard.  You'll be a leafblower one of these days, don't despair :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urheawindsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhea Windsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/18/01 5:08:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: boggle</span><hr size=1> IMO you shouldn't start the quest until you are 50+. <br>
Just thought I would share a lil info with the grovers. The last 2 times I have been to kill the corruptor, there has been a youngish druid there with little or no help to kill the corruptor. The second time I went, there was a druid who had spawned all of the gathering and only had to turn in the last piece to spawn him. But she was sitting there trying to scrounge up people to kill him. I was a bit frustrated that this person had spawned everything and did not have a force to take him down. So, the 2 times I have been there my friends and I have had to kill the corruptor for these people. (the first time I couldn't wait around for my turn because I had RL obligations) <p><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/Rhea69/RHEATAG2.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualuien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aluien</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/18/01 8:11:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: boggle</span><hr size=1>      There's no reason not to start this quest very early in life.

Make it the suest it's designed to be (a bit at a time) instrad of being one of these people bragging that it only took them X ammount of hours to complete it.<br>

I'm sure you must have ran into the misfortune of heading over there after someone else did theirs. :(<br>

As for level, if you can kill the mob, or contribute, it's all yours.<br>
<br>
As for Althele and the others depopping, there's another possibility:  Someone came along behind you and handed in the book (looted from the DE Corruptor) to Althele after you started the cycle.  All the NPC's depop when you hand in the book, even if you're in the middle of chain.  This happened to a guildmate, who was understandably furious.<br>
<br>
Always a good idea to give a /shout before starting any quest, along the lines of &quot;please don't molest Althele for the next few minutes&quot;  etc.<br>
<br>
A lot of folks let the Reavers kill the druid NPC's and hand the book to Althele when she spawns later.  Wish they would check to make sure they aren't messing up anyone else's efforts.<br>
