<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hail to my fellow brethren of the sword and faith. I come to you today with a heavy heart. I wish not accuse anyone of anything, nor am I arrogant to assume that I could ever describe the role or place of paladinhood in the land of Norrath. I am truly speaking from my heart and just wish for a few of my brothers and sisters in arms to listen to me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have seen many brave and great deeds, along with the most foul of treachary and betrayl. I have been witness to the gravest of injustices (that were, unfortunatly, out of my control). I am in the 20th season on the Lanys T'Vyl server. Some say that is really a long time, most say I am still too young to truly understand my gift of Knighthood.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My life so far here has been nothing but an endless procession of deaths, struggles, injustice, and just plain outright hard times. I have seen most of my friends level past me, truly realizing that the next time I group with them won't be untill were are all in our 40's. With the expection of Holy swords and the like, you will not see numbers comparable to that of a warrior in terms of outright melee damage. Our magic will never be that of a cleric's superiority. I have wondered why I see the Shadow Knight's Dark Reaver or the warrior's Executioner's Axe, most of the non-planar ultimate armor (i.e. Lambent, Ravenscale, etc..), and other class's items daily on the auction block, but never once have i seen a piece of Ro, Ghoulbane, or even a Deepwater Harpoon auctioned. I have heard of these sold very rarely, and even then, it has almost never been a paladin making the auction. Our quests are arguably longer, harder, more invloved, complex and result in almost nothing more than what other classes can obtain with a few hundred or thousand platinum at your local bazaar. Make no mistake, I don't believe they should be there, but it upsets me a little that I could easily purchase a Dark Reaver, if choose to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the answer to my questions are: because I choose paladinhood. It is a very simple answer, although the meaning behind it is so complex, each of us must determine what it means to be a paladin. Is it worth it? Is it what you want? Most people who i have asked have said no, by a far majority. Yet there are those who truly spark my imagination, people who truly belive it is worth it. Some say our class is nothing more than a flaming sword with some poor stats. Some say that our place in a group is a liability. And there are a few of of us who truly understand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have been questioned by many why I choose paladin as my class, and have never been really able to answer them. Well, the reason I write this is because I have found out what paladinhood means to me..I finally know why all this time and effort is worth it to me. It is who I am. And I suspect that is that might be very similar to the reason of many other who have committed themselves to the class I speak of, even if they do not know it for themselves.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It is in our hearts and minds that we truly know what we are for. When we do finally achieve our armor of Ro after months of dead ends and truly horrific questing, when we do finally have he proud honor of wielding SoulFire, paladins are only reminded of what they stand for. We are not defined by are stats, magic, or any other factor other than what we do, say, and think. Nor am I saying we are weak, I have seen a paladin out-duel two warriors at once (by the very skin of his teeth, mind you) of an equal level (50). We know how to fight, and when it comes to it, we can defend ourselves and still stand for more even after the most vicious and brutal of battles.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am not trying to say that any other class is weaker in thier own right. We are all, for the most part on equal terms, contrary to the claims of most people. What I'm saying is that we are the only class, in my opinion, that is truely defined by what we do. We live or die by our skill and intelligince, not just our stats. Our honor is not measured by the damage we inflict, nor what wealth we can amass...it is defined by who we are.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I may be crazy, or I may not even know what I am talking about. Inevitably, some will say what I have wrote is a &quot;flame&quot; against all other classes, or that I think paladins are better than others. I truly think that we are all equal, and that what I expressed here is what I feel is my own defining explination of a paladin...not anyone else's. Please do not take this as an insult if you are not a paladin, nor do not take it as what a paladin should be if you are. I am just hoping to inspire the thoughts of my brothers and sisters in arms to think long and hard about the choices they once made and what whatever other choices they may make in the future.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am sorry if this seems to be a rant or a flame or anything of the like, I truly apologize if it seems that way. These are just a few of my thoughts, and I hope to share many more someday (If i get a positive reponse here, I have many more files I have written like this that I could share here =).<br>

<br>
Yours is a profound and thought provoking statement. I, too, considered long and hard about choosing the path of a paladin. I tried the ways of magic as a wizard but found it to be unfulfilling. My brother plays as a Dwarven Warrior and I have watched him many times and found very little thought involved in the ways of the warrior.<br>
<br>
I agree with your statement that, to an extent, all classes are equal. There are strengths and weaknesses to all classes. At times, it even seems that some classes have certain advantages over others.<br>
<br>
I am only an 11th season paladin but it has taken me many months to achieve this. In that time I have seen many of my friends that started after me far surpass my level and, perhaps, take the easy way to achieve that success. Sometimes, being a paladin means having to sacrifice your own needs and desires in favor of helping others to achieve their greater good.<br>
<br>
I believe that one who truly seeks the way of the paladin can see and understand that, as you said, we are not defined by our stats or posessions but by our actions. I do not say this to belittle or put down other classes and say that there are not other classes who pursue more than posessions. On the contrary, I have encountered other classes who have exhibited the qualities of a paladin far better than I. What I am saying is that for the paladin, it is a way of life. To consider others as better than ourselves, to stand up for what is good and true, to even sacrifice ourselves for the greater good is not something that everyone can do. If, in that pursuit, we are able to attain strength or posessions, than that is a gift from Marr. But when it becomes greater than seeking the truth and upholding all that is good, then one must rethink why they have chosen to be a paladin.<br>
<br>
It is a choice that everyone must put serious consideration into and make for themselves. Simply because one decides not to be a paladin does not make them any less or better than any other class. But when one decides to become a paladin, it is a choice that will require much effort and perserverance. And one will be judged by how they act as a paladin. You may not gain the physical things as quickly as others, but the spiritual rewards will be much greater!<br>
<br>
May Mithaniel Marr guide you in all that you do!<br>

/ooc I know that a lot of this sounds silly but I have tried and watched a lot of different characters. I have also been reading the different message boards and seeing posts by people who are disillusioned with the game and people in the game and how it's not worth it anymore. Granted, I am still new by most players' standards and am still a low level character who has not encountered much of what is discussed but I believe that the game is what you make of it. My brother is a level 47 Dwarf Warrior and he still has a great time playing the game despite the bad elements who try to ruin it. It's all in how you deal with negative things, be it in the game or in real life. I chose the paladin class because I thought it would be fun and it has been. True, it's not for everyone but then again we're all different. If we weren't then the game wouldn't be fun would it!</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#666666><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uvardendarketernal.showPublicProfile>Varden Darketernal</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.zyworld.com/zeldarules/stolen%20triforce.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Global user</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFFFF>5/1/00</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFFFF>5:54:13 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://logostorage.tripod.com/orbs/crystalballred.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Paladins of Norrath</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Oh my brothers I feel your pain. Being a paladin is nothing but self sacrifice and often times heart ache. I am now at my 30th season and I will tell you I have nearly lost my faith several times. Arris I will tell you it may be well past your 40s until you can group with your friends again and be effective. At 30 my friend who I was ahead of in my teens have surpassed me, some are nearly lvl 40 and I am still working on 30. My guild has shuned many of my friends and now they are gone, and I often feel alone as no one is brave enough it seems to come with me on my quests, after all there is no profit in it for them. Often times I am forced to go it alone, and at lvl 30 being alone is a nightmare. So you can see, it does not get any easier.<br>
<br>
However this is what I always remind myself of. This is what I have choosen. All and all this has been my dream since I was a boy, a chance to be a Knight. (being an elf is kind of cool too =) )   In real life, wearing armor wielding swords and the like would probably get me thrown in jail. Chivalry is often rewarded with strange looks and giggles (though this is not always so). So it is with Everquest that I am able to do this. So here it is. I knew when I choose this it would not be easy. Besides if it were easy the reward would mean very little. It takes a very special person to succeed with a Paladin and they are out there. Beld, Romidar, Varrus, Bephsi and so many others have proven this. It is a difficult life to lead and not everyone can do it. I will also tell you that it seems like for every level you gain, your friends gain 2 or 3. <br>
<br>
Let me tell you I miss my friends. So we are all faced with a choice here. We can either give up, or we can do what most people can not and BE a Paladin. Have the courage to push on even when it seems like the task is impossible.<br>

<br>
I come to you with both a heavy and joyful heart.  Like you, I have watched friends steadily level up to and past me.  So much so, that I often can't help them or hunt with them.  Thus, I miss out on the comraderie.  I have been campaigning since mid-April of 1999 and had the misfortune of achieving Level 35 less then 2 weeks before Kunark opened.  Those I had been hunting with in Lower Guk have mostly migrated to the new continent.  While I would like to join them, I put off ordering the expansion until I was closer to L40.  However, misery aside, I have never once regretted the class choice I have made (I occasionally bemoan my choice of race, Half-Elf, but that's a side-issue).  In fact, I didn't need much thought at all to select Paladinhood... I have played more paladins in AD&amp;D then any other class. I have always loved the chivelry and Honor demanded of my characters.  The eternal hunt to rid whatever realm I was in of ALL forms of undead.  The satisfaction of knowing, when I plant my battle standard, the whole army knows which way to run to (or by) when things go badly, for I shaltn't retreat from said location.  My group of knights and I formed a nucleus from which the rest of our forces could fall back to.  In several epic battles that riveled Agincourt, Lonely Mountain, and Bastogne, when all fronts were in full retreat, my knights and I stood fast in Harm's Way; an island of stability in the ocean of panic.  Many were the times when we alone remained on the field of battle.  Often, we held long enough to turn the tide of the battle by enabling our forces time to rally and regroup.  When Treachery struck at our flank and panic crumbled our formations, I led my knights in a charge.  That's right, not withdrawing, no!  We brought the battle to the enemy.  With the might of Truth and Justice, we dispatched the traitors to a man and then wheeled about to charge across the flank of the enemy before once again planting my standard in the center of the field of combat.  Only when the enemy threw their 4 remaining dragons (1 Red, 2 Blue, and 1 Black; all Very Old or Ancient) at us, did we fall.  Of the 30 of us in my command, only 6 survived... 2 who would never campaign again.  Myself and the other 23 gave our lives gladly, with the knowledge that our sacrifice gave our forces time to escape.  And, as Bunch &amp; Cole so elegantly stated in their awesome book/series STEN, '[we were] the most expensive piece[s] of meat they ever butchered.  (1 Blue survived the assault, only to fall when my comrades returned to the battle, spurned on by our courage and selfless sacrifice.)  In the same token, many were the times when I planted myself at the zone entrance or tunnel entrance in Unrest and stopped, deflected, or merely slowed trains.  (Even a L32 Paladin with GB has difficulty holding 3 Festering Hags...  &lt;fried&gt;)  Likewise, I can't count the number of times when my LoH restored our puller or cleric from sure death, which enabled our group to rally and dispatch the hated spawns back to Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Are our sacrifices acknowledge?  Sometimes.  Often not.  Are they noticed?  Nearly always.  When the Warrior's strength fails  (HEAL PLS!!), when the Mage can't get that last spell to fire (EVAC!! &lt;Your spell is interrupted&gt;, when the Cleric has insufficient mana for that last heal (LAY HANDS, LAY HANDS!!!), it is the Paladin who saves the day.<br>
<br>
Take courage, my brothers and sisters.  Through Mithaniel Marr's guidance, we will bring the Light to Darkness.  Side by side we will stand firm against the onslaught of Hatred, Fear, and Evil.  And, should one of us fall, remember always that we know...  we know... the struggle, the pain, the hardships, the courage, the honor.  And we will never forget...<br>
<br>
Fare Thee Well.<br>
