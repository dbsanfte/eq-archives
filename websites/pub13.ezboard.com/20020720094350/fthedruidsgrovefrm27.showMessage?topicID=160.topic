Always been a druid at heart and love the roleplaying aspect of the druid... so it was a simple choice for me in the Hibernia realm.  Have characters in the other two realms as well... the friar is starting to seem very appealing due to his versitality.<br>

Druids... if played right... are a good deal of fun and able to do many things. <p><center>

<br>
Personally, I look at it as more closely to a druid/enchanter combo, with the speed spell, un-commandable pets, haste and slow, mesmerize, stuff like that...or maybe kind of like a shaman. <br>
<br>
Regardless of what class in EQ it is like, the Theurgist is incredibly powerful. Getting to 5 was tough (I couldn't take blues at all in level 4), but once you make level 5, and get your elementals, you can take yellows easily, oranges are not difficult (nor is there much downtime...maybe 20-30 seconds), and even reds are doable. I went through level 5 last night in about the same amount of time it took me to get through level 2....which was about 4 times as fast as level 4. It doesn't stop, either. I've heard stories of level 35 Thuergists soloing yellows easily, as well. <br>
<br>
Plus, with our elementals, haste, damage, and bladeturning buffs, slows, mezzes, and DDs, I figure we'll make a great addition to a group, as well. <br>

The first step is to look past the nomenclature and look at what the class can do and how it is played.  <br>
<br>
I chose the EQ Druid because it had good solo and grouping potential, could self-bind, and reduced travel time (with SoW and gates).  Due to the long regen times in EQ, self-healing was an important part of the soloing ability.  But it was purely secondary for me, and unlike some of us here, I really didn't see or play the druid as a "healer."  (Those who did probably see more similarities between the EQ Druid and Hibernian Druid than I do, but that's natural....they're looking at different functions.)<br>
<br>
In DAoC, binding and gating are non-issues.  Travel time is even more important than I had thought (characters run sooo sloooow in DAoC, and horses are very limited in where they can take you) so the running speed buff is critical to me.   Self healing wasn't a problem, since I realized that you can't heal yourself during battle while soloing, and the regen time afterwards is so fast that healing wasn't critical.  With the casting system in DAoC, I also have to stay out of melee combat as much as possible, thus lessening the importance of healing even more.<br>
<br>
As far as a combination of soloing and group desireability, the Theurgist ranks very high on both scales.  In fact, the Theurg has a better combination of solo/group attractiveness than the EQ Druid. We also seem to be very desired for RvR.  For a description of what I can do as a level 25 Theurgist, see the Theurg thread on this page.<br>
<br>
If you want to put it in EQ Druid terms, I have SoW, roots, snares, DDs, buffs, debuffs, and very effective, fast acting DoTs (the elementals).  In giving up self-healing, I gain a single/group swordturn buff, AND a group mez.  A good trade.<br>
<br>

Essentially the reason for both is versatility.  I find myself playing my Warden even more these days and they turned out to be a very good class.  They can heal, rez, buff, sow, group damage add, self haste, self regen, melee styles, can wear heavy armor and they get the same line of spells the Theurgist does that absorbs melee blows ( a very nice spell line)<br>
<br>
Quite frankly a Warden is an excellent addition to any group of any size and I am having a blast with him.  With self healing and regen I generally can solo faster than pure melee types . . . at least so far.  Hero's and Champions take down their prey faster than I do, but I don't have as much downtime.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usunnysky1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SunnySky1 </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/2/01 2:19:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=160.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fnets.com/images/clouds.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you choose YOUR class?</span><hr size=1> "After 2 years of discussion on the usefulness of a druid in a group, I wanted to be a pivital group member."<br>
<br>
If you want to be pivotal group member, it seems to me that you have to go opposite the "style" of the realm in choosing your class for said realm.<br>
<br>
Hero = most desired group member in Hibernia as most people going to Hibernia are heading there to be "magical".  Bards, druids, mentalists abound.  Most can heal, nuke, or both.  Hero's are the only true tanks in Hibernia, and will be especially important in RvR (for saving my druid's life, hehe)<br>
<br>
Healer = most desired group member in MidGuard as most of the people going to Midguard are interested in the Melee and damage dealing classes.  I see tons of warriors, thanes, nuking types, etc.  Healers are few and far between.<br>
<br>
Is there an analogous class in Albion?  I don't know as I haven't visited Albion as of yet, but I would suspect that Knights are a dime a dozen, and some other class would become the pivotal group member class.<br>
<br>
I've picked my classes for my perceived "fun" factor.  I love the fact that druids in Daoc are not animal killers.  I love the fact that my Hunter's charmed pet runs off when released (without killing newbies on the way back to its spawning grounds).  I am enjoying archery being a viable tool for advancing my character.<br>
<br>
Most of all, I am enjoying the variety DaoC has to offer.  It really isn't ONE game, it is really THREE games wrapped up into one, with common UI, leveling mechanisms and tradeskills for each:  <br>
<br>
The FEELING on Hibernia, while playing in fairyland on my druid makes me feel like the gentle druid of old.  There are a ton of other women playing there, and the people I have met have been nice, considerate folks. Because so many classes are healers, our groups tend to be rather well healed and buffed, but a little underpowered, and therefore we must hold back a bit on what we attack in order to succeed.   It truly feels like a gentle and magical place to me.  <br>
<br>
In sharp contrast, the FEELING on Midguard, generated by the scenery and music and the rather aggressive folks I have met, inspires me to feel like kicking the crap out of some pansy a$$ elf.  It is an exciting place to play, lots of risk taking and aggression; but you can spend hours looking for a dang healer ;-P<br>
<br>
I enjoy both classes, on both realms, and I have no problem with the fact that my Hunter's rightful prey in RvR will be druids and elf casters.  Strange, but true :-)<br>

What I discovered is that the dev team was so obsessed with preventing "exploits" like kiting that they seriously nerfed crowd control abilities, almost to the point of uselessness.<br>
<br>
The duration of mesmerize is cut in half on each successive cast, you can't mesmerize injured targets, and any offensive spell (even debuff) cancels it.  This makes the area effect mesmerize spells near useless, and the single target spells only marginally useful.<br>
<br>
Charm is pretty powerful because you can charm an NPC up to your level, but it has to be a humanoid and they don't exist everywhere (and many "humanoids" aren't charmable, such as giants, ogres, certain quest-related NPCs, and undead).  Also, you can't charm in combat.  Overall I'm disappointed that charm has zero tactical value in combat; it's just an alternative method of getting a pet before combat, although once you get it you have the most powerful pet of any class.<br>
<br>
The extensive stat debuffs are much more powerful than I thought, probably the most powerful aspect of this class.  In the 20s, a yellow will usually kill me in 3 hits, but with the debuffs layered on, I can pretty easily tank it for a minute or two, most of the attacks being misses or hits for very low damage.<br>
<br>
Amnesia and confusion are interesting spells, and supposedly have an interrupt property that is useful for RvR, but not very useful in soloing.   The DoTs are useless because their damage/power ratio is lower than straight DD.  The DDs and life drain spells are decent but not amazing.  The running speed spell is very useful for moving around, and getting way out of range once sprint runs out.<br>
<br>
The "roots" and "snares" (actually, all of these spells do the same thing, a near-root or very very very slow snare) are nerfed to prevent kiting -- any damage breaks the effect, and there's the half-time reduction on successive casts.  Oddly, though, you can debuff, whereas this would normally break mesmerize.<br>
<br>
Overall, I feel like a seriously gimped enchanter who can life drain and debuff, and probably will consider a new class (druid?).  I'm also really disappointed that Mythic was so hypersensitive about kiting, and nerfed class abilities so much to prevent it.  In this game, for the classes who can do it, I don't see how kiting would be helpful let alone overpowering. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 11/2/01 4:03:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utidaljade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tidaljade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/2/01 7:58:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=160.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.truepath.com/jadae/Blue.JPG width=102 height=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why did you choose YOUR class?</span><hr size=1> Druid.

Lol love that sayin on your guilds page. <i>Albionians are red, Kobolds are blue, I will kick j0r azz, Hibernia ownz j00~!</i><br>
<br>
Why i choose a Ranger.<br>
<br>
Every online FPS i've played i've always enjoyed sneaking around and sniping people. It also seemed to be a nice change of pace from my Champion that i played to lvl 32 in beta. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong Champions are freaking awesome, can tank for a group, solo really well, debuffs ownz in PvP and then a instant DD spell to supplement a kick azz 2h melee skill. <p><table>

They are more like the EQ druid, jack of all trades thing.  They can melee but defense is a little worse than a pure tank.  Nice buffs including a group sow, group melee damge buff, and spell that soaks one hit.  They can heal in a pinch.  Are they the star of the group?  No that tends to go to the nukers.  However if played right they can give that extra something that makes a group into well oil machine.  One trick I have found is let someone else pull, get aggro, then have the warden heal the puller before getting into combat.  Oh in PvP wardens look like druids but hit like a truck in melee compaired to them ;)<br>

Thanks lol. We were aiming at lessening the stress away from gaming and still have a blast, hence our odd themes.<br>

I needed speed song, since I played a Druid in EQ.  Nothing made me more happy then to run past someone in West Karanas, laughing the entire way...  ahem, err...<br>
<br>
Everyone agrees, bar-none, Bard Travel is the way to go in Hibernia.  An enchanter who gets Empowering Spec to 45 will get a speed increase of 53%.  A Warden who gets Nuture spec to 44 will get a speed increase of 53%.<br>
<br>
At Nuture spec of 13, I already have 59% speed increase.  I actually plan to get Nuture up to 43 to get 104% speed increase, mostly for Endurance Song 4 &quot;Rhythm of the Cosmos&quot;.  The more melee that are grouped with me, the more efficient and effective the group is, with minimal to no downtime.  The added damage they inflict over time means a lot more experience.<br>
<br>
As a Bard, I make this realm's best Mez'er.  My default single target mez is level dependant, not spec dependant.  If I decide to spec, I gain AOE mez.  For the naysayers, I respectively disagree, AOE mez is useful, but for mainly one purpose only, for dungeons.  The DAoC mez changes means you have to pay more attention.  Playing an enchanter in EQ, it tended to get boring doing xp grind groups.  Now, you need to coordinate your group, call your next shot, break mez in ORDER of mez.  People screw up, they die (a lot more then they normally do).  I have no problems with that, to be honest.<br>
<br>
With memblur and DD shouts, I act as interceptor.  With mez, I act as crowd control.  While playing my drum and shouting and mez'ing, I can provide heals.  I can be the first to run away quickly in order to get back to the group to rez them all.  Oh... I can rez. :)  Right now my heals are decent, just a little worse then a Regrowth spec'ed druid I normally group with.<br>
<br>
And, if I want to, I can solo.  I can solo some yellows even at level 30, it requires I have all Orange or Yellow con armor (player made and enchanted) and Orange or Yellow con weapon (player made and enchanted).  I use a DD/mez/DD/mez/DD method in order to soften them down so I can take them.  I prefer to group though.<br>
