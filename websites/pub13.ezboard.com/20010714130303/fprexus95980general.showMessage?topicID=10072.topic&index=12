Died, camped fully, came back next day, and when I logged in the corpse vanished.  People at the entrance to KC confirmed that they had seen the corpse there just moments earlier.<br>
<br>
I petitioned and sent e-mails to Zrinic and Jill Henderson (JHenderson@station.sony.com), who is the CSR lead, and they were able to verify in the logs that my corpse decayed prematurely, and they arranged a time for me to meet with Zrinic online and have my character restored from a backup prior to the corpse loss.  Thankfully I lost nothing, and actually came back with more XP than I died with, because I had an unrezzed death between my backup time and when my corpse vanished.<br>
<br>
Be polite, but insistent, and I'm sure that Zrinic will be able to help you.  I was ready to finally throw in the towel on EQ for the couple days it took to get in touch with Zrinic, but patience definitely paid off.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Second (yes, I know I am going to get flamed for this), but it also amazes me the number of people that will tear apart a CS rep every chance they get. I will not say that all of them are wonderful and delightful to deal with. Then again, neither is every player you encounter. Some of you need to remember that they have a set of rules and guidelines that they must follow. It is just like any other job. If you decided to break 5 rules in one day at your job, would your position not be in jeopardy? There ARE rules, there ARE guidelines that CS is required to follow. Lets please remember that. Generally, CS reps, whether they be Guides, Senior Guides, GMs, or whatever, will do all they can to help you. Sometimes it may take some patience on your part however. Some things don't have hard and fast solutions. So please, the next time you want to rip apart the Guide/GM you're speaking to, think to yourself, &quot;would I want to be treated this way?&quot;. <p><h1 align="center"><font size="3">Krya T`Jolie~ Dark Enchantress</h1></font><p>

You must work for a large company! I break into hysterical laughter every time I hear this type of rationalization.<br>
<br>
&quot;They have rules they have to follow!&quot; - WHO'S RULES? Theirs? So they type up some crap and put it in a book and that makes it law? NO, unless the Supreme Court of the United States (home of Verant) ruled that the Verant EULA is the law of the land then all of the SH*T they serve up as a &quot;rule&quot; is adjustable.<br>
<br>
The fact is the players on this server are their clients! We pay the bills, we buy those servers, we pay their house notes, we pay for the dinner on their table. Yes, they worked for it, yes they deserve it. But treating your clients like crap is idiotic and should be pointed out and railed against.<br>
<br>
I was on Sufu's 10th Ring Quest the other night when the NPC screwed up and ate the quest item. We had 77 people waiting for a hour while the only jackass at VI headquarters allowed to read a log finished his coffee break. This is BS! Get off your lazy ass and service your customers. He then told us, after we waited, that even though it was a error he couldn't do anything.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is the CS sucks, and they should fix it! I love the game, I play it, I respect the people who do a good job (and there are lots) but overall the Customer Service is not up to par and acting like it can't do anything cause the &quot;rules&quot; don't allow it is just BS! Fix the damn &quot;rules&quot; then...<br>

<br>
I think Verant customer service does some things well (given the compromise between the high needs for service and the budge $10/month allows where they have to use guides), and some things very badly that need improvement.<br>
<br>
But the difference is, I can say which specific things I think need improvement; they're reasonable issues, such as the fact that they announced a policy that you reporting your account hacked will get it banned even if you were not at fault - which may be a small percentage of times, but nonetheless it's wrong.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand right nonsense here:<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 1: There are no bugs.&quot;<br>
Verant admits they have bugs. You are wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 2: If you report a bug you are either lieing, a cheater, or a hacker. So reporting a bug means we ban you.&quot;<br>
Verant encourages the reporting of bugs, and they fix many from customer reports. Wrong again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rule 3: We are not responsible for any of our coding, we are perfect and never make mistakes and being the al powerful wizard of oz, err Verant we can do as we please. &quot;<br>
Verant says they are responsible for their coding. They admit they aren't perfect.<br>
<br>
The real problem are the few customers who just throw mud no matter what and ruin the Verant-customer relationship, like your post. It's why they ended the discussion on their message forums.<br>
<br>
Try not to throw temper tantrums at Verant - it won't help anyone.<br>

<br>
Thank you for your email. While I wholeheartedly understand<br>
the frustration in losing items, as I explained in game, your corpse decayed while your account was logged on. Please note that the corpse timer will continue to count down at the online rate if you are online with any character on the account. I am sorry to be the barer of bad news but as per our reimbursement policy posted at everquest.station.sony.co.../index.jsp we are unable to restore your corpse. If you have any further questions please feel free to email me.<br>
<br>
<br>
And again: <br>
He camped out 1 or 2 hours after the death. (Yes, he camped, he didn't /q)<br>
He logged on 2 days later with a Necro to summon his corpse (he didn't go to chat or played a twink, this was the 1st time, he logged the account back on), Kirak was even expecting to be able to get the exp back with a rez. No corpse there and the GM tells him, it decayed exactly 24 hours after the death...<br>
<br>
Ok, the account stayed online, though Kirak camped out. A problem of his ISP? Hard to believe. <br>
A problem at Verant? Gotcha !<br>
<br>
We had many situations, where the CS didn't help us a bit. This one is one too much. What the hell do they loose, if they restore his character? He didn't die in VP or some zone like that, he died in the Tower of Frozen Shadows. Quite easy to get his corpse out of that zone. He justed camped after he died, because it was late and he had to work the next day.<br>
<br>
I am sick of all this &quot;the player is guilty, unless he (or she) can proof he isn't&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
We are a small guild. We are more like a family. We meet each other 2 or 3 times in a year. Kirak is always willing to help others. If such a nice person looses everything due to a problem, he has no influence upon, it is a horrible situation for our whole guild. Sure we could get his stuff again quite fast, but that isn't the point. He cancelled his account due to the fact, that he got NO HELP AT ALL from the Verant-CS. He is tired. So are we as a guild.<br>
<br>
We still have some things, we will try. If all that doesn't help, I am afraid, you won't see many &quot;Ringers&quot; in EQ anymore.<br>

There is no excuse for not helping him.  Let's say your friend was lying (which I don't believe to be the case).... why would he stay on-line all that time and let his corpse rot? That just doesn't make sense. It's a stupid policy, and should be changed... or at least Vetoed in this instance. <p><img src=http://people.we.mediaone.net/sosmit/timnewsig.JPG></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utimothimus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Timothimus</A> at: 6/21/01 10:33:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AADDDD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrozarvorlagen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krozar Vorlagen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/22/01 12:17:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.rocketnissan.com/krozar/cscicon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kiraks corpse decaying</span><hr size=1> Most people should know about the corpse rotting rules, its posted and written in same place where the 24 hour online and 7day offline rule is at (help file AND vi site) it by no means is hidden.<br>
<br>
Its a tad outdated because this was before the 3 minute empty corpse poof was removed.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Level 1 - 5:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 30 minutes<br>
Level 6+: &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time, whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
*Note:  If you have no items on your corpse, it will decay in 3 minutes regardless of level.  It is best advised to get your corpse right away.  If that is not possible, remember that one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of game.  Also, be advised that your corpse decay is still advancing if you leave your computer at the character select screen or play on another character on that same account.<br>

If there was a bug due to some gaming code..then we should not be held responsable for it.. Eq is a game where acquiring an item may take months and even years to get.. and then all of a sudden the quest npc dont work due to bugs and all u get is a response from a gm saying &quot;read the policy&quot;.  Sure i understand why they would make such a policy but the fact is verant just decided to fook the customer they acquired over thw years cuz they know they can get away with it...<br>

Actually, now naked corpses stay three hours with nothing on them if you are over a certain level (not sure whether that is the 6+ level or if they made it over level 50, but I think it's the 6+ level). After you resurrect the naked corpse it poofs. (Just did one today for a guildmate who died in Iceclad porting in then died again porting in second time to get her first corpse - can that be the most stupid/dangerous place to port in? Things are always roaming through there). <p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=1 width="50%">

<br>
The 24 hours becomes pro rated too, 12 hours online + 3 1/2 days offline = max time allowed.<br>
<br>
Many, many people die and think, 'to hell with it, I've had enough tonight, I'll get it later, ... let me see... which twink shall I play ?'<br>
<br>
Many younger players share accounts with family members, and when they log of their character, the other logs on.<br>
Same account, same time online.<br>
<br>
Guides and GM's do not enjoy telling people that they have nothing left, its one of the worst things you have to tell someone. Policys are strict, but the GM does have a little leeway. Remember that over every GM (server GM), is a Lead GM (A few servers) and so on.<br>
<br>
They are all accountable to someone further on up the line.<br>
<br>
Follow it thru, e mail again, but be really sure that no one was on your account, in fact, ask them to tell you which character was logged in and where.<br>
Our GM's are pretty good, persevere, its not instant, a character restore is a lot of work, and takes time.<br>
