I am in W Karana hutning bandits on the hill above the farm.  We are off to the left on the side closest to the farm.  I am grouped with another druid both of us at level 12.  We harmony the camp and pull a bandit out with root.  Suddenly in it's path spawns a caster... DOH  ok we are still ok it will just be painful. Then another bandit and a brigand are running up from the downhill forest camp and decide to jump into the fray.  ok now neither of us has sow and we are gettign pounded.  Instead of us both dieing I tell my comrade to run and jump into the fray grabbing the attention of al but one bandit.  so now i am being pounded by  a bandit, brigand , and bandit caster.  As i watch my hp plummet I figure may as well try a gate .. gate just about to go off when the bandit gives me the finishing blow and I see the dreaded message YOU HAVE BEEN KNOCKED UNCONCIOUS&quot;.  Just as I start ranting and raving about the heritage of bandits, i see you regain concentration and continue casting.  LOADING PLEASE WAIT.  I appear at my bind spot laying on the ground with my HP bar 1/4 of the purple left.  Luckily no newbie bug came and killed me ( in qeynos newbie zone )  I was thrilled and overjoyed at living when i had already considered myself dead.

After going in to the portal in Najena things got a bit out of hand and we got a nice train after us. And not a normal 2-3 mob train. This train consisted of a couple of enchanters,  three or so elementals and a couple of Tentacle terrors.<br>
<br>
I am madly running towards the zone and i am watching my HP bar drop rapidly. I am almost at the zone with a bubble left when i get rooted. So i stand there and see my bar drop to three quarter, half, a quarter. Then a Tentacle terror releases his knock spell on me and knocks me over the zone border breaking the root. I zoned into Lavastorm with seven HP left. <br>

Anyway, I tried to run, and it roots me, and then I see You have died...I return to my bind point (the Druid circle, I like to save that 230 mana hehe), with no spells, items or mana.  I say WTF, I never had that happen before...but when I checked my exp, I hadn't lost any :)  The first time I ever heard of not losing exp upon a death, apparently if you die to a DoT, you don't lose exp.

I was fighting a spiderling (and winning =) ) when two of his buddies decided to help out.  I knew I couldn't handle all of them, so I ran like a girlie-man for the guards.  Got there and turned around to watch Guard Soandso KILL 'em.  Well, just before he got the last one, it bit ME for 3 points and I fell unconscious.  And then I noticed I was poisoned.  I noticed this 'cause I kept getting the message &quot;YOU are bleeding to death&quot;.  Actually, I got spammed with it.  hehe  And I'm lying there unconscious and watching my purple go and can't do anything.  Can't yell for help, can't ask for a heal, can't speak and I'm bleeding to death.  As I hit the last bub of purple, I get &quot;The poison has run it's course.&quot;  Cool!  Oh wait, the purple is still dropping!  It got down to about an eighth of a bub before it started to rise.  I don't want to EVER get that close again or feel that helpless.  ('Course, it's better than dying, I suppose. lol)<br>

My group was AoEing in Solusek B on fire imps.  We had a bard pulling, and somehow aggroed around 5 or 6 of them (only one group).  Our wizard and cleric dropped and I got the evac call, well, after the wizard and cleric, guess who was next on the aggro list :/ <br>
(three upheavals for ~2000 damage to 5 fire imps will do that).  I hit evac and got beat down.  I got hit for over 400 damage in about 6 hits.  I made it with 27 hp left and got dropped somewhere near Kaladim.  My party, what was left of it, made it to the druid ring.  Fun stuff.<br>
<br>
Another good one happened yesterday.  We were in the hole doing the last step for the Shammy uber quest.  We got @#%$y and the room filled up with mobs.  He looted what he needed, our enchanters were dead, tanks were all but dead and I hit evac.  About 3 seconds into the cast I was summoned.  Fortunately I ran into a corner before i evaced and thus i hightailed it back to that corner.  Little known fact is that if you move or are knocked back while casting, if you can make it back to your exact point, youre spell will go off (very usefull for evacs).  So i got the 4 live members out of the Hole with that one.

(Can't play EQ now and will have to retire completely at the end of the month so I might start posting instead?)<br>
<br>
Lvl 34 and still in CT, I logged in and joined a group in Silver Temple. As I head to the temple yard, one of the monks is saying that the AoF has spawned in the wrong place. <br>
*Bad feeling* <br>
They assure me that the AoF isn't in my path, I go in, find the group, the monk is feigning, I ask what they want me to do... next thing I know, the AoF and friends are beating on us. Someone is yelling to evac, I wonder if they mean me, try to invis and mem one of my gates and the AoF is all over me. Ouch. I am no longer invisible and the AoF is beating on someone else and I do something I hope I won't do again in my remaining playtime: I panic and run. Visible. Past a lot of lizards. At least I didn't train the AoF to zone... I made it to just inside the double doors to the zone when a broodling decided to slap me and there I am sitting naked on the Feerott side :\ Turns out that amongst the casters in the group I'd just joined was not one but two wizards, one of them was designated evac'er and had gated pretty much everyone else out. If I had stayed put, I would have survived. To top it off I conveniently had a root in one of my inventory spots, which I left on my body, but never managed to find a cleric :\<br>
<br>
Swear to never hunt in CT again unless it's hunting the AoF (I have two other stupid deaths there), and to never panic again.<br>
<br>
That evening, a monk friend of mine asks me to come back to CT, where he is starting an AoF group. Vengeance time? I gate back, join the group, we invis and head for the AoF. I get to swim through a pretty green bubble and we set up camp in the little side room. Monk, druid, chanter, rogue, cleric and I think a SK. Monk does his crazy monk puller thing (which he is very good at) and pulls appropriate amounts of lizards and alligator while we wait for the Hairy Ugly One. I'm DS'ing, snaring, str buffing and taming the occasional alligator when the AoF spawns. How we knew he'd spawned? I was writhing in the grip of agony, he's hitting me HARD, and I resist his Scarecrow fear spell (Did my endure magic have anything to do with that? I don't know but I am still glad I chose that occasion to buff with it)<br>
I move away so the others can get him off me, cleric heals me up from 2 bubbles, I get mad. Screw mana conservation, I'm going to make that guy PAY! So, I dot him and start nuking with immolate (yes, resists and all that but he wasn't at prime health when I started and they all landed pretty well) while the monk and rogue are beating on him. Third immolate lands: You have slain the Avatar of Fear!  Vengeance is mine!<br>
Inspect: He has the BP. The rogue has mostly RS except the coif and that piece, so we dress him up in all black :)<br>
<br>
We kill some more stuff, people have to leave. We lose the enchanter, cleric and tank, enlist a new enchanter, send the enchanter to pick up a new cleric and tank in the courtyard since I am reluctant to guide people somewhere I've gone *once*, monk peeks around while rogue and I wait... I make a comment about how the AoF maybe shouldn't attack people who worshipped fear, and I guess he heard me because the next thing I know, he is back and beating on me, again. The guy just loves me, it seems :) <br>
The monk later stated that he'd peeked down the ramp and seen the hairy brute charging him and almost begun to cry; odds were pretty good he was going to wipe the floor with us. I'm at less than half a bubble of health and throw a gHeal or two on myself in case something else wants a piece of me, cast evac and wait for 9 nervewracking seconds while monk and rogue beat on him and yell evac at me... next thing we know we're all in EK, alive and on one hell of an adrenaline rush :)<br>
<br>
Back to Cazic, pick up cleric, chanter and new tank in the courtyard, return to the area through the pools, pull the bastard and kill him a second time. Claws drop. Wanted them for my baby woodelf warrior, but lost the roll so she'll have to wait. The evening proceeded with highlvl people from the rogue's guild stopping by, including a cleric in Robe of the Seeker who buffed us and bought my splitpaw gloves off my hands for 50 pp. (He was auctioning for gloves and a crude stein so he could complete the 'caster' look and thoroughly confuse people :) )<br>
<br>
AoF popped a final time before we finish, unfortunately he spawned in the wrong place again and dropped a BP to some highlvl people hanging around the silver temple area. Oh well, can't have them all. It was good fun, great revenge, and now I have Guk to get bewildered in :) <br>

I was solo kiting mammoths in Everfrost, and had just found one when sow began to wear off. The zone was fairly crowded, with a lot of people killing mammoths, so I wanted to make sure I got this one. I figured I could snare the mammoth, then cast sow on myself. <br>
<br>
Well, I cast snare on the mob, it was resisted. Ack! So I run away and try to get enough time to cast sow on myself. I successfully cast sow, and then turn around to snare the mammoth. Unfortunately, I had forgot to re-target the mammoth after sowing myself. The result? I snared myself! Of course this also canceled sow. <br>
<br>
So now I'm sitting there hardly able to move with this mammoth gorring (or whatever its called) me for 50+ points of damage. Hmm...what to do?<br>
<br>
Luckily, I had gate memmed, and luckily somehow I got it off. So I pop up at my bind point (half way across the zone). I still have 75m, so I figure maybe I can finish the fight.<br>
<br>
Quickly I mem cancel magic, remove the snare, and re sow myself. Then I med a bit. Just as I get 85m or so, the mammoth shows up. I quickly snare HIM, and proceed to kite him to death. Phew! <br>
<br>
Well thats my near death story...also of note: one level ago I was kiting tesch mas gnolls and snared myself...that time I DID die hehe<br>

<br>
Being a somewhat masochistic druid, I like to go charm bats and solo LDCs from time to time.  This usually results in my untimely demise or gate, but every now and then it turns out profitable.<br>
<br>
This particular time involved the worst train/slaughter I have ever seen.  My bat had 3 LDCs on it (/rude wanderers) and I was starting to realized I was f#@@%d.  Charm breaks, I try to gate....keep getting interupted.  I finally realize with 4 mobs on me and my health dropping like a stone I'm not going to gate...I take off for zone.  At this same time a group was breaking in to eboots.  Out of some sick twist of fate, they mess up, and are screaming train train at the same time I am running to zone.  <br>
<br>
It gets better...running to zone I run through Kings by accident and grab a few kobolds, reach zone...2 fire imps and a lava guardian. <br>
<br>
The whole zone except windows is racing for lavastorm. <br>
<br>
Crap I'm dead.<br>
<br>
I start spamming the space bar to jump past the imps.  <br>
<br>
I hit zone, but I figured the imps got a few blows in on the way past right before I'd zoned, and figured I'd be by the sebilis bubble.<br>
<br>
To my shock, I lived, with a whopping 15 hitpoints left. (and this with myself buffed to the best of my abilities).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the majority of the other people were not so lucky.  I think I have a screen shot somewhere of the carnage that awaited me when I zoned in.<br>

As I was backing up preparing to nuke, what do you know the shammy lands a root on me successfully.  Well luckily I had prepared for the fight and had memmed gate, or so I had thought!!  I tried to gate twice, but to no avail.  At this time I thought for sure I was a goner, but I tried one more time and wouldn't you know it, it actually worked.  Now the funny part of this is I didn't have gate memmed, but actually had Ring of Karana memmed and actually got it off while all 5 things were beating on me.

As I wandered around inside I finnally got to the other side of the castle and lo and behold it led to a large cavern and Nagnafen was just sitting there.  I just sat there in disbelief, cofident that I was out of his range.  After about 5 seconds the beast charged. Lol i almost pissed in my pants. He came right at me.  I couldn't react in time he was upon me in seconds.  He hit me 3 times for 250ish each, then cast fear on me.  lol that saved me.  I ran back like 2 steps and I was outside the area that he would follow.  Lol I had actually lived.

I'm a 12th season druid fighting in Crushbone. I've travelled around a lot and been all the way to Freeport and back (twice).  I've previously fought monsters as tough as Legionnaires in a small two person group at level 10, with a high level druid casting buffs and heals every so often and got all the way to level 11.  So I go off and join another group later and fight larger numbers of monsters with the same results and got to level 12. So, proud of myself as I am, I decide to join a Throne Room group and were doing amazingly well, until... You guessed it, the morons in the tower camping Crush forgot that D'Vinn also spawned there. They, being low on health after their last Crush encounter, get slaughtered right in front of our little group, and I foolishly decide to heal my friends... Wrong stupid thing to do, so now I have D'Vinn whooping up and right then, the RG comes out, the legionnaires spawn, the Emissary spawns and all hell breaks loose.  So I, being the creative person that I am, decide to jump out the window behind the door. (those of you that know the spot and the NPC pathing bugs know this is a great tactic, as long as you don't fall in the moat) Anyway, he slaughters my group except for me and my friend who saw me jump out and followed me quickly. It doesn't take long for the legos, emissary, and D'Vinn to finish off what was left of my group and come after us.  We wisely decided to jump the moat and run around Trainer hill towards the Slaver house and exit that way, shouting HUGE TRAIN to zone all the way.  We make it the the cave entrance and lo and behold, guess who shows up.  luckily for us, not the poor brave souls who thought we were newbies running from cents.  One look at what we was chasing us and they ran for the zone, but not before we passed them, hence we made it to the zone, thanks to the people who tried to help us. And those of you who did help us, thanks you very much, or I surely would have lost my level. We made it safely with half a bubble left and no mana. Much to our chagrin, and that of the party running the other way, someone else was running from a train of cents and zoned just as we did, needless to say, some very shaken up newbies rezoned seconds later, to face the previous train that we and the rest of the zone crew was whacking on.  In the end, I was left with 17 hp and no mana, I medded up till I had enough to cast camo and then ran (walked more like it) to Kelethin to heal the rest of the way, thanking Tunare all the way.<br>

My group started running towards the zone, after we had already lost 1 or 2 members.  I was running for it when I started getting beat down by two initiates.  My health dropped amazingly quickly, and I got knocked unconcious.  For some reason though, the 2 mobs left me after I got knocked unconcious.  So I was laying there, with aggro mobs running around, near the tree at the bottom of the zone in hill in MM.

So we were trying to draw a couple spiders to us to clear the path. Next thing I know, I have 5 spiders on me. I am losing health really fast and was soon at a half a bubble of health. I begin laughing hysterically because I could only imagine what it would have looked like to see a Halfling Druid trying to tap dance around a handful of spiders. So, I say out loud, &quot;I'm dead,&quot; and the next thing I know I get summoned. I was like, &quot;WTF, what level are these spiders??&quot; It was my Mage partner who did a CoH on me. It totally freaked me out. I took a few more hits before her pet held them off long enough for me to hit Sup Heal....with 40 health left. <br>
