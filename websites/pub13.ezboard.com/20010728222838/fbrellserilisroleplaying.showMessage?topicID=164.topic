<br>
It was half past one o clock when Sequin Ta’tier emerged from her room.  She had disappeared off the surface six months prior to the day and had resided in her Tower in Neriak since then.  I was not surprised when she revealed to me that she planned on hiding her pregnancy, but her wishing my interest was unexpected.  Little did her shortsighted mind know that her offer was an opportunity I would not refuse.  It baffles me that she went unnoticed in Neriak and that no one took notice of her second consecutive trips to the surface, seeking an alliance that had already fallen through.  Most persons must not have taken these occurrences as anything out of the ordinary, for Sequin was nothing but unpredictable.  Lady of Intrigue was it?  I do not care.  Still, the woman relied too much on luck and it would eventually be her downfall.  As Sequin’s robed form walked towards me I glanced towards the swaddling cloth she clutched in her arms.  The baby’s eyes mirrored hers.  I allowed myself a brief smile.  The woman caught sight of it and returned it before thrusting the child into my arms.  I nodded briefly to Sequin and looked down at the tiny thing.  She was an unusually quiet baby.  Her perfect almond eyes fixed on mine as drool dribbled out of her mouth.  After a moment, I looked up to see Sequin return to the sitting room in full armor.  She stared at the child in my arms for an instant before bowing and leaving the room without a word.  Foolish woman.  While a large percentage of the world feared or worshipped her, I knew she was walking dead.  My gaze returned to the child.  This little one would be what her mother could have been.  First, a name.  Something beautiful, mysterious, intriguing…<br>
<br>
A most playful and curious child my Lilanya is.  This day she has already killed… rid herself of two playmates, but I can not blame her, I would grow bored of them as well.  Her features are growing to look almost identical to her mothers, but I am disappointed with her lack of skill.  Her swordplay lacks as well as her strength.  She is surprisingly nimble, however, and favors lighter weapons that she can maneuver and strike with.  She will never make a powerful warrior, but perhaps I can manipulate her skills elsewhere.  She is a most clever child, I’ve never seen anything quite like it.  Her creativity is unmatched and her methods of torture are most delightful to view!  It amazes me that a child of seven years can be so resourceful with such devices.<br>
<br>
Lilanya is a most charming young woman.  It is an endless frustration trying to find someone appropriate to teach her lessons in etiquette.   So far she has bested every lady in both looks and technique.  Her posture and stature are unparalleled by any and every noble I have ever observed.  The girl has learned well and has excelled in every field I have instructed her in.  Were she not like my daughter, I would consider taking the precious creature as my wife.  No woman will ever be more cunning than this little jewel.  I did cherish the reaction the little thing gave when she saw her mother’s bloated corpse.  Azaryl tired of Sequin after all, most amusing.  The child was unfazed and almost giggled.  It is almost time for her appearance on the surface.  With fifteen years of knowledge of her mother’s doings and all that I have taught her, no army of sword or wit will be able to best her mind.  And her loyalties are and shall always belong to me.<br>
