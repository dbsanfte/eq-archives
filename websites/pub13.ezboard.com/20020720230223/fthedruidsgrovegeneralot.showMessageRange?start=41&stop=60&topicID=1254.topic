I've never heard of this company, and they are not on resellerratings.com.  They could be fine, or they could be a nightmare.  Unless you want to gamble, make sure that you have some feedback about this place before you order.<br>
<br>
<b><i>AMD, AMD Athon XP DDR-RAM Barebone System <br>
* AMD PALOMINO XP, Athlon XP Palomino 2000+, 1.67gig</b></i><br>
<br>
Note that the 2000+ is NOT the best "bang for the buck", if you're on a budget.  A 1600 or 1700 will be a lot cheaper, while offering almost the same level of performance.  Stick with 2000+ only if you want the absolute best regardless of cost.<br>
<br>
<b><i>* COOLER MASTER, Socket A Cooling Fan </b></i><br>
<br>
Cooler master makes crappy HSFs, be warned.  They're the same as the ones that come with the retail AMD CPUs.<br>
<br>
<b><i>* ASUS, A7V266, Socket A, DDR, Retail Box </b></i><br>
<br>
Bad choice.  The KT266 chipset is old and slow.  Go with a KT266A board.  I suggest the Epox 8KHA+ or Asus A7V-266E.<br>
<br>
<b><i>* KINGSTON, 512MB, 184-pin DIMM, DDR266 SDRAM, CL2.5 </b></i><br>
<br>
This might work fine, but consider buying a more reliable brand, such as Crucial (using Micron chips), Corsair, or Mushkin.  It's not essential, though, if you will be running the memory at the slowest default speed.<br>
<br>
As to your ECC question, that's just an added parity bit on the RAM for error correction.  You don't need it, and it only makes the memory more expensive.<br>
<br>
<b><i>* MAXTOR, 40.9GB DiamondMax Plus 40 U100 7200rpm, oem </b></i><br>
<br>
Maxtor isn't the best in terms of reliability, but it's better than the IBM drives.  :)<br>
<br>
<b><i>* VISIONTEK, GeForce 3, 64MB, DDR, TV-Out, oem </b></i><br>
<br>
This is a great card, though I'm surprised they're still selling GeForce 3s.<br>

<br>
Be warned that the cheap, no-name power supplies are more likely to fail or cause problems compared to a quality power supply.  The no-name ones are about $50 cheaper, though, and that is why OEMs usually cram them into systems.  You might regret the decision within the year, though.  ;)<br>
<br>
If you want an alternate suggestion considering your $1,500 budget, from newegg.com (since they have all the components and are a reputable vendor):<br>
<br>
Epox 8KHA+ motherboard - $98<br>
Athlon XP 1700+ OEM - $127<br>
Enermax FS-710 case w/Enermax PS - $99 (this is a big, nice tower case with a good PS)<br>
Mushkin PC2100 256Mb x 2 - $158<br>
Seagate Barracuda IV ST340016A 40gb - $87 (this drive is reliable and super quiet)<br>
Alpha 8045 heatsink (bare) - $35 (this is the best heat sink on the market for Athlon XP)<br>
Thermaltake 80mm, 37 CFM fan for the 8045 - $7<br>
Toshiba DVD-ROM - $65<br>
Sony OEM floppy - $9<br>
Netgear NIC OEM- $13<br>
Visiontek GF3 Ti200 - $181 (this will run about as fast as a GeForce 3)<br>
Turtle beach Santa Cruz OEM sound card - $65 (it owns the Audigy in terms of sound quality)<br>
<br>
Total price - $944 + tax if you're in CA + roughly $30 for Fed Ex express saver shipping<br>
<br>
You pay around $1,000 and get a system which, in my opinion, owns the one you listed in terms of overall quality, performance, and value.  If you want, add a MS intellimouse optical and decent keyboard for about $40 more, and a <i>nice</i> monitor (not the "here-is-the-cheapest-monitor-we-can-still-advertise-as-19-inches" monitor) such as the Samsung 900IFT 19" flat screen (about $370) or the Sony CPD-G400 19" ($345).<br>
<br>
Even with the mouse, keyboard, monitor, and setup above, you're just under $1,500.<br>
<br>
[Edit] I just noticed that you <i>insisted</i> on a 1900+ and GeForce 3 minimum.  I don't think that's a good idea, but in that case, add $99 for the 1900+ over 1700+, and $120 for a GeForce 3 or $150 for a GeForce 3 Ti500.  All this together puts you right at the $1,500 mark, maybe a little over with shipping, but you end up with a much better system than you were planning. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 1/13/02 7:09:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrairwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brairwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/13/02 10:43:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, show me some numbers</span><hr size=1> Salicia you feel like building it yourself or does that worry you?

<br>
Save yourself a little money.  The 1800+ right now seems to have the most bang for the buck.  But in a month or two depending one when you get the PC maybe the 1900 with be cheaper.  However you will not notice much difference from the 1800 to the 1900.<br>
<br>
Oh look at the 60 gig drives.  Something like 14 bucks more than the 40.  I have used both western digital and maxtor,  They are about the same in failure rate for me.  I saw a bench mark a while back that compared western dig vs maxtor drives.  Western dig was faster on fat32, maxtor was faster on NTFS.  Neither was faster by huge margins just a percentage point or so either way.<br>
<br>
little side note.  XP and 2K both have a 32 meg fat32 partition limit.  NTFS does not have the limit.  However fat32 is easier to support if you have a problem.  NTFS better file compression plus security in case you want to lock up your PC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usynergistx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>synergist x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/14/02 2:54:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://rcloues.home.mindspring.com/images/tiny_x.png width=80 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, show me some numbers</span><hr size=1> Tudamorf, the link in Salicia's post ends up showing an A7V266-E, with the KT266A chipset.  Not sure which one actually comes with the computer - Salicia, find out before you buy, as the KT266 chipset is horrid in comparison to the KT266A.<br>
<br>
I can also recommend newegg.com.  I've purchased from them several times, each of which went well.  They're an excellent place to purchase parts.<br>
<br>
Brairwolf said: <i>XP and 2K both have a 32 meg fat32 partition limit.</i><br>
<br>
32 megs?  Neither Win2k or WinXP can format FAT32 partitions that are larger than 32 <i>gigabytes</i>, although they can mount them and use them normally.<br>
<br>
NTFS is generally very slightly slower than Fat32, but the increased security and data integrity makes NTFS superior.  Don't use Fat32 unless you have a good reason (Example: I also use linux on my computer here, so I formatted the partition that holds all my documents and data as FAT32, because NTFS write support in Linux is a dangerous thing.) <p><hr>

"Maxtor isn't the best in terms of reliability, but it's better than the IBM drives. :)"<br>

Interesting that you say that - my dad and I have bought many makes of drives over the years, and the only one that hasn't ever broken down on us is IBM.  We've still got a small stack of dead Seagate Barracudas on the "broken, but too painful to throw out" shelf :)<br>
Guess that's true meaning of "your mileage may vary"<br>
<br>
"A 1600 or 1700 will be a lot cheaper, while offering almost the same level of performance."<br>
<br>
Good point there.  1700 is the current "sweet spot" just before the prices go up almost exponentially for relatively little gain.<br>
<br>
Otherwise the system looks fine (Assuming it is indeed the KT266A).  It's way better than anything I've built for myself - for instance I'm regretting buying the cheapest Geforce2 (was being stingy with xmas stuff to buy at the time as well)... which runs Luclin good enough - all I wanted at the time - but causes Windows to crash like crazy if it's running at 4X.  This is what happens if you get poor quality hardware made with the cheapest components...<br>
Needless to say I doubt it'll run Flight Sim 2K2 very well!<br>
<br>
Oh, never had a problem with Coolermaster fans, though I don't bother with overclocking.  Bad experiences with it in the past, and I figure that if something can reliably run at a higher speed, the manufacturer would market it as the higher speed.  But it's always worth getting the best fan you can.<br>

I use western dig and maxtor without too many problems.  I am talking about business class PCs that do some massive data base crunching.  Most drives you get about 2 good years out of now.

Interestingly, the basic conclusion to the article is that the latest P4 has a very slight advantage in performance over the XP, since it uses a new core codenamed &quot;Northwood&quot; that performs very well.  Though I'd still get the AMD - it remains cheaper for practically the same performance, and still compiles the Linux kernel faster than the P4 ;)<br>

There is a known issue with the IBM Deskstar IDE drives ... I've seen numerous reports on hardware sites of premature failure, and I also bought one which began failing after only 3 months.  I've even heard of a <a href=http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?s=d568107e15d1072c56418239493adcff&threadid=248256&highlight=75xp+OR+75gxp>lawsuit against IBM in the works</a>.<br>

It's odd you have such trouble with Seagate, too.  I've been using Seagate drives since 1985 (remember the ST238 RLL drive?) and found them to be fairly reliable.  Only one failed that I can remember, and that was after many years.  Anyway I'd recommend the new IDE Barracuda IVs because they perform well and are soooo quiet.  You have to put your ear up to them to even hear them.<br>
<br>
<b><i>I always thought they were the best at storage, constantly pushing the boundaries.</b></i><br>
<br>
Actually that's Seagate.  Seagate has been the industry leader for at least a decade, always being about a year ahead of the next competitor.  Start working on a Cheetah X15 36LP and trust me, you'll curse every IDE drive in existence.  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 1/14/02 2:20:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usynergistx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>synergist x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/14/02 6:12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://rcloues.home.mindspring.com/images/tiny_x.png width=80 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About those numbers...</span><hr size=1> Only the IBM 75GXP line has the problem with failures.

<br>
The drive that failed on me after 3 months was the newer 60, not 75.  Prior to that incident, I installed over 100 hard drives over a period of over 15 years, and never had one fail so quickly.  I've also seen many reports of problems with the 60 line, enough for me to avoid buying them in the future. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 1/14/02 7:10:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usynergistx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>synergist x</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/15/02 6:32:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneralot.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1254.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://rcloues.home.mindspring.com/images/tiny_x.png width=80 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About those numbers...</span><hr size=1> Strange, I'd heard tons of nightmare stories about the 75GXP, but nothing but good things about the 60GXP.

It is way too heavy.  It is almost twice the weight that the socket is rated to support.  One good bump and your socket could be ripped off your board.<br>
<br>
Now the VOLCANO 6Cu+  is good.<br>
<br>
Also get Arctic Silver II paste.  Scrape off the pad and use this instead.  Keeps your CPU much cooler.<br>
<br>
<br>
Might want to think about the Cyclone Blower from antec. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.antec-inc.com/product/fans/f_speci.html">www.antec-inc.com/product...speci.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
Place it just below your video card. It blow heat out of your case. Got me a geforce 3 ti 200, that thing gets warm. I added the fan and it droped the heat my CPU was reporting by 3 degrees C.   Runs about 20 bucks.<br>

I'd recommend going with the heatsink/fan combo that Tudamorf recommended earlier (<i>Alpha 8045 heatsink (bare) - $35 and Thermaltake 80mm, 37 CFM fan for the 8045 - $7</i>).  I'm not a big fan of Thermaltake's HFS's; they tend to have a lot of flash but not very much to back them up.  Cooling is something you <i>don't</i> want to skimp on with an Athlon system.  The Dragon Orb will work, but Tudamorf's suggestion will work much better.<br>
<br>
Also, make sure the keyboard you're getting won't bother you.  It's all personal preference, but L-shaped enter keys drive me crazy :) <p><hr>
