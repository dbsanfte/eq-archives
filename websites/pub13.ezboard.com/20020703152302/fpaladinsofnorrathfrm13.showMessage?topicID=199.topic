My post is somewhat irrelevant now but hey, what the hell.<br><br>Currently level 40 and I solo quite a bit due to the fact that I am somewhat afk at all times because I have to study during many play sessions. I do this because if I'm not looking at the monitor I want to be the only one in peril. Having other people die on me is my least favorite pastime.<br><br>To find a solo I find a place, outside Luclin because of the lag, with enough mobs to keep me busy at all times. The worst thing to happen is to be fm and have no baddies to kill. I don't mind casters, I almost enjoy them now that I have 3 stuns.<br><br>I generally use 1 hand weapons when fighting casters and 2 hand against others. When I am MT for a group I go to 1 hand because of the massive amount of AC on my shield. (35 isn't a lot to some of you I know, but to me it's HUGE) I also carry around a Cat o' Nine Tails for the proc, an agi buff.<br>For armor I use high AC stuff, and make sure I have above 100 sta. I'm currently saving up for haste or waiting for someone to respond to my thread about the Swiftclaw Sash <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>My current weapon is the Centi War Spear, good for those of us on a shoestring. Got mine for 300pp and it's probably cheaper now. <br>If I get into trouble I do what everyone knows to do. Root and heal. If I'm in trouble against a caster I generally just zone. <br><br>Normal fighting I keep up the courage line, armor line, and divine vigor. Against casters I also buff my resists. I don't use symbols because I'm poor. My spells are usually like this<br>1 - Heal<br>2 - Yaulp I<br>3 - Buff<br>4 - Stun<br>5 - Cease (pulling and casters)<br>6 - Heal<br>7 - Root<br>8 - Divine Purpose (good if you need to go afk, reduces downtime quite a bit)<br>Yes there are 2 heals, Healing is there for when I don't need to heal 270hp and don't have much mana to spare.<br>Against undead I replace the buff with Spook the Dead and DP with an undead nuke(not the level 30 one, it's too slow)<br> <p><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jmanis07077483/DruidSig.jpg">Sadad, 40th DW Knight - Tribunal server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulhorrsilvershoal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LhorrSilvershoal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/30/02 7:52:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solo Tactics</span><hr size=1> I suppose I should post my own tactics :P<br><br>Location:<br><br>Well, I didn't start soloing until about lvl 50ish so most of my solo spots are Kunark.  At lvl 50 I was in Dreadlands pulling anything but casters (spiders) to the small area just before the Burning Woods zone.  This is a great place to &quot;pally kite&quot; a mob.  The zone is just behind you in case you get into trouble.  I pulled just about anything but Ravishing Drovarg's and Widows and Recluses.  At 51 I was despairing of the slowness of xp so I hit the abandoned combine platform south of the wizzy spires in the hidden valley in DL.  This was great xp, and found with a few buffs and patience I could even solo he Wraithbone champ.  I stayed there until lvl 53 when mobs started turning green.  At 53 I hit up Burning Woods.  there's an undead ruins along the west wall of the zone at about -1300.  A lot of light blue, but plenty of wandering dark blue nearby.  a good open space and the pathing is great to fear kite.  if you're feeling lucky take on the occaisional Zealot or Extremist, they are casters, beware Gullerback he's almost 100% MR.  I stayed there until I hit 54, ah 54, one of the remaining hell lvls.  But, you get Enstill.  I hit up LGuk.  I parked myself in the 'safe hall' where there's plenty of dark blue that spawn nearby (Dar Ghoul Knights are best).  I even had the pleasure of soloing frenzy, but alas no FBSS dropped (  .  Now that I'm 55 I plan on hitting Scarlet Desert.<br><br>Weapon:<br><br>I'm currently using an Argent Defender.  Unless you're an EC whore, or have uber friends to twink you, then you are most likely in my situation where your class isn't the most lucrative.  I'm saving up for an Arg Protector as I type this.<br><br>Gear:<br><br>i'm a ghetto pally so this is what I use:<br><br>Deepwater Helm ( a must have)<br>DW vambraces<br>DW bracer<br>Hero bracer<br>DW Boots<br>Guants of the black<br>Wolf Hide Cloak<br>Sebilite Scale leggings<br>Treeweave<br>Giant Scalemail mantle<br>some beard thing for my face from velious heheh<br>and a Talisman drop off of Velious dragon for neck<br><br>Buffs:<br><br>Symbol<br>Armor of Faith<br>Divine Vigor<br>Daring (DW Helm)<br>Endure Magic (DW boots, great for fighting casters)<br>Valor of Marr<br>Instrument of Nife<br>Journeyman Boots<br>and for downtime in LGuk (invis Vs. Undead)<br><br>Spells:<br>Im usually equipped with :<br>Cease (for caster interruption and Pulling)<br>Desist<br>Expel Undead<br>Ghealing<br>Divine Purpose<br>Valor of marr<br>Enstill<br>spook the dead<br><br>Tactics: <br><br>Well, in LGuk i would pull with Cease, i could single pull that way being over 52.  I would pull to the 'safe hall' then just melee away, if I was losing the fight I would enstill (root for about a minute and a half) and I can almost top off my HP with the DW helm, then back in the melee. once they start to run I can root and nuke with expel undead if mana is good, or just melee.  Top of HP with Helm and do over.  when buffs start dropping,  IvU med to full buff up again, med to half mana then kill more.<br><br>Escape tactics:  <br><br>I always try to fight near a zone, but in Guk that's not really possible so it depends on the situation.  Usually i'm only fighting one mob, so it's no  prob, if things go bad I just enstill and camp out.  if I get more than  one mob I'll juggle them.  I'll spook one off then melee one, when the other comes back I'll spook the one i'm meleeing then melee the new one, then so on and so forth,  I can kill two mobs for very little mana that way, and I usually don't get KS'd.  Also, since Safe hall is near Frenzy and Lord camp, those spots almost always have groups and keep the halls nearby pretty clear.  I usually strike up a friendship with the group and if things get bad can usually run to them for help.  if you're lucky they have a chanter that can crack ya.  I got a drive-by C3 the other night and with Divine Purpose up I was non stop invincible pulling for 3 hrs.<br><br>So that's me.
