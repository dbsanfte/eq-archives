Tanking and Stunningwith some minor healing and buffing  thrown in.<br><br>1. Armor: If you havnt gotten rid of all your stat gear yet, do it now and get the highest AC items you can possibly get. Its the only way to survive in Kunark.<br><br>Heres a list or armor you should have<br><br>A.  Visible Armor<br>As much deepwater as you possibly can have except maybe Val arms, gloves and helm<br><br>if not<br><br>As much valorium as you can possibly have.<br><br>if not<br><br>Jasarth scale greaves<br>Black Enamled CP<br>Treewave<br>Sleeves of the ancients <br>Kylong boots<br>Skull Shaped barbute<br>Hero bracer<br>Bracer of scavanging<br>Any Ro Armor<br><br>B. Jewlery<br><br>Elec Black Saphire/Sarnak/Forrest Loop<br>Sarnak Mask, Gangrenous Beetle Mask<br>Neckalce of Superiority/Mith Torque/<br>Plat/Gold Fire Opal Rings/Silver Jacinth rings<br><br><br>2. STUNNING<br><br>A. Make the Ultimate Stun Hotkey<br><br>Make a social key with /cast 1 /cast 2 /cast 3. Make your fasters stun be the top spell gem, your second fastert your second spell gem etc...  When ever you hit this hotkey your fastert, least resisted stun avaiable will cast.<br><br>Stuns have several uses and with 2-3 you can be very effective with them.  <br><br>B.  Interrupting With Stun.<br><br>The most important use of stun is interrupting. Paladins are the best spell interrupters in the game by far post 50. No other class keeps 3 stuns memmed and has bash (enchanters carent close enough to the fight to time properly and dont want to risk the mob agroing them).  <br><br>When fighting casters DONT just bash and stun whenever you can. Time it properly as soon as the caster starts casting hit bash. If you disrupt fine, if you miss immediately hit stun.<br><br>If you only have one stun available dont cast it to interrupt a DD spell from a shaman. Save it becuase the next spell is going to be Torgors and tou will need something to interrupt that spell. If you do nothing else against shaman mobs, make sure its interrupt torgors. It looks like a heal spell when cast with blue effects.<br><br>If you see a mob casting gate continue to cast stun and bash until it is dead. If interrupted once a mob will re cast gate until dead.<br><br><br>C. Paladin Mez<br><br>With 3 stuns you can permanatly keep a mob stunned. This is very mana intensive, but can work well with clarity 2 and enetually you will get a resist and the mob will attack you. Good thing your a tank and dont care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is useful with two paladins in a group alternating stuns as well.  If you have a rogue in your group chain stun when the mob's back is facing the rogue for continous backstabs.<br><br>D. Helping Enchanters Mez (The old 1-2)<br><br>If your puller pulls 2 mobs, stun one a few feet before he gets to the group.  This will enable the enchanter to target the mob better since he will be separated from the one you are fighting.  Use a dd stun for the first stun, then immediately cast the lvl 30 non dd stun.  That way if mez is resisted, the mob will still be stunned and the cahnter can try again. If mez isnt resisted you wont break the mez.<br><br>E. Breaking Mez<br><br>For some reason you cant break a mez with a dd stun and have the mob be stunned. As soon as you dd stun a mob it makes a line for the enchanter unless its been mem wiped or atoned. As soon as you break mez cast the lvl 30 stun to stop the mob from pummeling the enchanter and to reagro the mob onto you.<br><br>F. Misc. Enchanter Helping<br><br>Watch the enchanters health in battle. If it starts to drop it means a mob broke mez and is pummeling the enchanter. Turn off auto attack and use the lvl 30 stun on the mob so the enchanter can remez. If you leave auto attack on you may accidentily break the mex so turn it off.  Then go back to the mob you are killing.<br><br>G. Taunting with Stun<br><br>Stun is one of the most effective taunts in the game. Not only does it taunt, but it stops the mob from hitting whoever its currently on. If one stun fails to taunt, just keep stunning until it does.<br><br>3. Pulling<br><br>Forget the lull line. It rarely works and when it does the lulled mobs get agrod from bad pathing anyway. Its pretty useless except in rare occasions.<br>Use a shield when pulling and switch to 2h if you want to after pull for the extra ac and resists.<br><br><br>With 2 mobs pull with stun and have someone root the stunned mob when it comes just before it gets to the group if you dont have an enchanter. Rooting to pull sometimes has the unintended consequence of auto pulling any roamers that go by the rooted mob. Root pulling is fine, if you know the area well enough that there will be no roamers.<br><br>If you have 3 mobs, root to pull then root one of the remaining 2 on the way back. Instill is too slow to channel through most of the time so use regular root to park when the mob is beating on you.<br><br>4. Parking.<br><br>If you need to park a mob becuase you have no enchanter. Use stun to agro it on you and slowly move it away from the group. Then either root it..or have someone else cast a longer lasting root like instill on it. Another option is the chain mez noted above<br><br>5. Healing<br><br>Paladin healing power goes way down post 50 becuase of the number of HP tanks now have buffed and the fact that post battle healing is more or less useless when you can just wait for the next cheal.<br><br>Its still usefull in small zone groups with no cleric (which are rare), also a fast gheal can often save a caster until the cleric can heal them. Im only 56. so I dont have supp heal yet, but its not a big improvement with a cleric in the group and with the mana penalty it might not be much mroe efficient.<br><br>6. Divine Favor<br><br>Alot of people dont use this spell, but it has 2 uses. One is to keep it on the enchanter at all times. This will enable them to remez a mob without eating their costly rune up.  The second is for the zone run out of sebillis. An extra 150 hp never hurt if you are being stunned by mobs while running out of sebillis.<br><br>7. Buffing<br><br>Your job as a bufer really comes into play when the cleric is low mana. Casting guard, aof, or symbol when the cleric is low mana always helps.<br><br>8. Weapon Selection.<br><br>This really depends on what armor you have and what weapons you have available and what the make up of your group is.  If you have 960+ ac without a shield after buffs, a high damage 2h is your best bet.  FA, ornate runed blade, rof of lam, granite face grinder etc...unless of course you can get the uber rare Halycon Broadsword. You should be able to interrupt ok with 3 stuns and not need bash.  If you are in a caster intensive area might want to use a shield as well for the extra bash unless you have FA.  If its below 950 and especially below 900 get a 25 ac shield and use a stave of shielding and once it procs if you have one switch to a Sword of the Morning. In fact if you have a stave, I suggest using until it procs if you are using 2h as well.<br><br>Well this is just a start, hope it helps and when I think of more things Ill add them.<br><br>Beld <p><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><img src="http://www.harrythecat.com/graphics/k/knight3.gif" align="center"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/gwlaw99/clipboard3.gif" align="center"> <img src="http://www.harrythecat.com/graphics/k/knight2.gif" align="center"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uhottoq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hottoq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/00 2:44:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Guide to the 50+ Paladin</span><hr size=1> Good guide Beld, gave me a few ideas. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ucalalron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>calalron</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://ezboard.com/exgfx/gicons/misc_1.giif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/00 4:08:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Guide to the 50+ Paladin</span><hr size=1> I do quite a bit of pullin while in groups and find that in kunark if ya can break line of sight the mob wont agro but if there are roamers you get on all kinds of hate lists lol I have been in situations where there are more then 2 mobs rooting backin away rootin the 2nd and takin one back the group we mad minute the 1st by then the 2nd has broke but with line of sight broken it doesnt come 3rd root breaks and that mob comes after its dead go back for the 2nd works like a dream in seb karnors and chardok haven't had to pull in howling stones yet people on tallon zek are just beginning to explore it <p><strong><font color=royalblue>Calalron Mystwalker</font></strong><br><a href=http://www.geocities.com/windwalkerseq target=web>Windwalkers</a><br>Head of the Mystwalker family<br>"We never do nothin wrong but we always get the blame"<br>Misc.CN member quote<br>P.S.Can we WW borrow this???....</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uderringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Derringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/00 4:10:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Guide to the 50+ Paladin</span><hr size=1> Looks pretty good to start.  Would like to elaborate more on the 'crowd control' section, as I see it as the weakest part of most Pallies I play with with my alts.<br><br>There is no reason that a Paladin cannot keep 2 additional mobs out of the battle when the group is enchanterless.  (I.e. 3 mob pulls should be your bread and butter when your doing crowd control).  Some steps to follow:<br><br>1. When the puller pulls, get yourself in a position to root/enstill one before they get back to the party.  best place to do this is where you have a long line of sight and can see the puller coming in from a good distance.<br><br>2. After you have one out of the way, stun another one, then immediately root/enstill the one you stunned.<br><br>3. You should never be Primary Tank while doing crowd control, because you can't afford to be taking hits from the primary mob the group is fighting, nor can you afford to have people /assisting off you when you are switching targets and running around.  You're HP will be used up quite nicely when you are rerooting, so don't worry.<br><br>4. Probably the most difficult part is when you need to keep those 1-3 mobs you have rooted away from the party.  Put yourself in a position where you can see most of the mobs you have rooted, and are consequently in the best position to break into a run when one of them breaks.  As soon as you see the root/enstill 'break' message, cancel your current target and run forward to where the mob is coming from.  You want to make sure you are immediately reaggrod, and that the mob doesn't have any time to hit any medding casters or other melees.  Your chances of sticking a root/enstill without getting hit now are gone, that only works on the initial pull.  Go back to a safe spot where the creature was originally rooted and attempt to reroot.  I usually try only once before I start a stun.  Many times you can channel through a root/enstill and then run immediately back to the party.  If you cannot, however, stun the mob, then reapply the root/enstill.  Move back to the primary mob with the rest of your group, and rinse/repeat when another comes unglued.<br><br>5.  The situation can get pretty hairy, so it can be good to have another member of the party help you out when the inevitable happens (2 or more come unrooted at same time, and you find yourself unable to get a spell off from the constant hitting).  Understand, however, that your primary job through this is to keep the unrooted creatures on you.  You have the hitpoints to survive with them for a decent amount of time, and you will also be the first one aggrod when they break root/enstill.  Your cleric needs to really monitor your health when you are doing this, as you will get beaten down pretty good.<br><br>On 2-3 mob crowd control duties, it will not be uncommon for you to come back to the primary mob with very little health, or even need a heal during your crowd control.  Make sure the Cleric knows what your doing and that they should position themselves so that they can drop you a heal when you need it.<br><br>I have found Paladin Crowd control to work very well, especially with a shaman on slows.  A slowed mob is easily controlled, and leaves the shaman to do other things without worrying about being aggrod on every root break.  I have used the above technique successfully without an enchanter in the group for raids in Sebilis and Karnors, and have no reason to believe it would fail in other dungeons.  The key is moderate pulling needs to be the max.  The most I've ever controlled was 5 Mobs near the Sebilis Crypt, and it was probably tinted with some luck, but we survived.  Take your crowd control duties serious, and maximize what you offer as a paladin... brute force crowd control.<br><br>Derringer Labyrinth<br>55 Knight of Pak'Cafan<br>Tarew Marr <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uhottoq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>hottoq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/11/00 6:10:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Short Guide to the 50+ Paladin</span><hr size=1> One thing to add about Divine Favor...It's also a great "save" spell...if someone is so close to death that neither you or a cleric could not save them with one of their heals, use Divine Favor on them.

If you know the area well, it can still be usefull.  Its always better (IMHO) to bring one less critter back even if your group could have handled the extra one.  <br><br>Its definitely not the best spell we get, but its still usefull in pulling 1 or 2 things %50 of the time instead of always bringing 2 or 3.  <br><br>Other than that, you and Derringer covered most of what I could think of pretty well.<br><br>One thing I do though is run backwards while pulling if I know that the pathing will allow me to stay ahead of stuff (it lets me target the next mob to be rooted as well as know when I'm far enough ahead of them to cast the root).  That way if I pull too many, I can start rooting them on the way back to the group.  You might have to zone or log real quick to clear the aggro lists, but its better than wiping out your party when a pull goes bad.  This works really well for me in Karnor's in between the bridges towards the front of the zone or outside if you have Spirit of Wolf up. <p>Kleitus <br>52nd Lvl Deepwater Cavalier of Erudin <br>Xegony</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/utheskyfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Skyfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/00 5:30:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WOW!</span><hr size=1> That stun hotkey idea is great Beld!

Paladins, out of all the melees, are probably the Kings of safely breaking mezzes.  Heres what I do, which seems most mana efficient and always produces good results:<br><br>1. Taunt<br>2. Taunt Again<br>3. Attack and Bash immediately after second taunt.<br>4. Immediately cast quick-cast Stun if the creature bee-lines at this point.<br><br>You'll notice that I don't always use #4... In fact, I bet I only have to resort to it about 20% of the time.  I am, however, very mindful of the fact that the creature may bolt for the enchanter, and I will often stop it dead in its tracks before it can even hit him/her.  If it does successfully hit the chanter, its a double attack for 120-120 or something, and a single gheal casted in battle returns them to full health (You do always CAREFULLY monitor your enchanters hitpoints anyway, dont you?)<br><br>As Morte alluded to, we are, indeed, very good at playing Enchanter Protector.  In fact, although it balks conventional wisdom, the cleric in the group should do very little enchanter healing.  As enchanter protector, however, it helps if we do not have to play primary tank for the group, so that we are free to step out of battle and do what needs to be done to protect the chanter.  I tell the cleric in the group to heal the chanter if he falls below 3 bubbles of health, but that I will handle everything else (I am anal about healing enchanters when this is my job, and will top them off from 4 bubs to 5 in mid battle just because I can, especially with Clarity or Clarity 2).  One of the reasons we are good at this is because GHeal is the heal of choice on a chanter 90% of the time.  Clerics are often casting longer duration CHeals, whereas we are able to quickly switch to the chanter and fire a Gheal at a moments notice.<br><br>Derringer Labyrinth<br>55 Knight of Pak'Cafan<br>Tarew Marr <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wulfherehausakliufr>Wulfhere Hausakliufr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(9/12/00 12:20:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://homestead.deja.com/user.marcus_aurelius/files/wulfhere_icon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> always break mez with taunt first</span><hr size=1> Have all the tanks taunt the mezzed beastie before you attack it.
