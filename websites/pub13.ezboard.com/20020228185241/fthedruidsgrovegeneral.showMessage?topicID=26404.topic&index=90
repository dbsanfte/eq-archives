that was an average, roughly around 10% if that... on a spawn thats 72hours + or - 12... and highly contested, in a plane... so this means a lot, if not most of your raids your never gonna see him, so that accounts for a lot more then 10 raids...<br>

dont try to tell us the mage epic is easy... give up the battle... your not a mage, so obviously you dont have a clue... I dont walk around saying "oh jees the druid epic is soooo easy how come you guys dont all have it after a month?" do I?  jees gimme a break, I dont caus I know its not one of the very easy epics... truthfully I dont have a clue how hard it is really, from the descriptions of the epics its not quite as hard as some, mage epic :P. but it is not like a rogue or monk, and I dont try to act like I know... So jees, when the mages can all testify for incredibly large amounts of time spent on it, just caus you asked a guild mage and he said 45 days, or caus you can make up some nice bullshit doesn't mean its the truth, give it up...<br>
<br>
In response to the admin, ya I saw that guy on the mage board, hes generally a hoyhead it seems, and locking a post for 20 mins to read it is perfectly acceptable, donno the circumstances for banning him, I dont wanna know, but ya hes generally a jerk...<br>
<br>
I still want to know tho, do you guys really believe, in your hearts, that the enchanter version, not yours (Yours has restrictions) is perfectly balanced with no flaw at all and is perfectly fitting with no problem at all?  If thats what you really believe fine, but why defend it, I've never understood defending things so much... If its bad for class balance its bad for the game, verant will most likely change it if its major, whats bad for the game is ALSO bad you YOU.  All I see is people responding quickly and nearly violently that"someone is gonna get my class nerfed!" even tho the reason your so concerned is caus you know its not right, and that you know that verant will figure it out and change something, not necisarily nerf you.  In fact I think at this point there are many of them that wish they hadn't put it in, but they'll never nerf it, too many pet chanters they wanna keep happy, so you guys are relatively safe....<br>
<br>
Of course none of you will admit to thinking its unbalanced... /shrugs <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uligge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ligge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/6/02 7:34:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqguide.com/changingtide/images/ligsmall.jpg width=100 height=129></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> *Kicks Yino in the shins*<br>
<br>
6th post on this thread I said:<br>
<br>
&quot;I will agree with the statement than an enchanter with Dire Charm and the right pet can whip the crap out of a mage and his pet. I will also agree that its a sickly overpowered ability once its earned, which is no easy task.&quot;<br>
<br>
However, I dont think its unbalancing because its a level 80+ ability. I think its sickly overpowered, but honestly who really gives a crap what a level 80+ enchanter gets for their abilitys. The % of enchanters that will ever see that is minimal in the overall population and who really cares what anyone 80+ in levels gets? They are just another of the bored bunch of people waiting on 3 day and 7day contested spawns with nothing much to do in between but play with pets. There is NOTHING to &quot;balance&quot; at this point people. Its End Game. Its boredom at its finest but when bosses/dragons/gods are up. What is an enchanter going to do with this ability? Solo for more AA points? Woohoo! I mean really.. Big F Deal!<br>
<br>
They earned it. Let them have their fun. *shrug*<br>
<br>
I think I just get upset when people point to other classes to justify or complain about their own classes short comings. Mages could have made just a strong of a case for better class skills and pet issues, and probably one more likely to be listened to and supported without attacking other classes abilities.<br>
<br>
People are confusing class balance issues that no longer exist post 60 with jealous of anothers neat parlor tricks. <p><p align=left><font face="Trebuchet MS, Tahoma" size="1"><a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=6031>Ligge</a> - Changing Tide Guildleader<br><font color=green><a href="http://pub17.ezboard.com/beqguide">Changing Tide's Boards</a><b> || </b><a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/bthefolk">The Folk's Boards</a></font><br>"You must do the thing you think you cannot do." - Eleanor Roosevelt<br>"When life looks like Easy Street there is danger at your door." - Robert Hunter</font></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caraddor>Caraddor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/7/02 6:29:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <b><i><br>

<br>
Nope, sorry, not full of bullshit.  45 days spent working on the epic for one, 2 months for the other.<br>
<br>
I never did say the mage epic was easy.  I just expressed doubt that it would take someone over a year's worth of dedicated work to do the epic.  I was challenged to ask some epic mages on my server how long it took.  I did so.  Now you claim I'm full of @#%$?  Are you just upset because I didn't happen to ask a rabid ranting mage that's full of self-pity?<br>
  <br>
True, I'm not a mage.  There are alot of non-mage players out there.  Are you saying that we're all clueless?  Because we don't play this "persecuted" class?  Get a grip.  I do have a clue.  I do keep myself fairly current on game related info.  My choice of class has nothing to do with that.<br>
<br>
I think some of you are confusing the concept of <i>time spent working on the epic</i>.  If you camp Quillmane for 24 hours, that is time spent working on your epic.  If you sign up for your guild's hate raid, and exp/raid/quest for 2 months until that raid happens, you did <b>not</b> just spend 2 months working on your epic.  If you go on vacation IRL for a week sometime during your epic questing, you did <b>not</b> just spend a week working on your epic. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52096">Caraddor</a> (Order of the Scattered Winds)<br>

<br>
Also... the guy above him, you mentioned us getting better results by suggesting things?  the only time a mage has ever gotten any response is when they made a comparison and a very valid balance issue, because gaining 9 AA exp points is so much incredibly easier then getting the mage epic that the epic pet should out perform it, especially because the mages are supposedly the master of pets... if it was the other way around and chanter epic gave them dire charm, and mages had to gain 9 aa exp points to get their pet that is the epic pet now, then it would still be unbalancing, but not as much, because mages should be better with pets then a chanter...<br>
<br>
Time spent on epic... ok so one of your guild members spent a month and a half and finished his epic, another one spent 2 months... and you can honestly think this is the norm for mages?<br>
<br>
My personal experience with the epic...<br>
I started my epic about the middle of the summer, and I got to a point, which I am still at now (need air crown, hate staff, and com torch) about maybe 2 months ago<br>
<br>
that first period of time was nothing but epic stuff and raiding, and I play a fairly decent amount... not a ton, but still...<br>
<br>
anyways thats 5+ months or so, working on the epic... I donno exactly how much time, and I didn't have to do quilmane because a friend got me that piece... thank god...<br>
<br>
your 2 month estimate for the mage epic is extremely faulty, and has no truth in it at all... you can not find an estimate by looking at 2 mages you know... a much better estimate would be found by speaking with mages accross the servers... which I have done...<br>
<br>
The point is only that the mage epic is nothing to sit back and say its easy, it can be optained at level 50, and you can buy it all... we dont say that about yours because we dont know first hand, and we'd appreciate if you would extend that same curtousy...<br>
<br>
Time spent on mage epic is MUCH  >  Time spent on 9 aa exp points (even 27 if you want to claim those other points did you no good and you were never going to get them anyways)<br>
<br>
Dire charm MUCH > mage epic<br>
<br>
Mages are supposedly the master of pets...<br>
<br>
those 3 points mean there is a problem with the skill and how it is balanced against mage pets... honestly all most of the mages want is an aa ability that makes our pets this good, or maybe slightly better for 5-10 mins, not permanent, but enough to be of use on uber mobs... of the remaining ones most of them want better pets accross the board, then you find a couple mages that are bitter and want dire charm nerfed in some sick way of "getting back" at the chanters for the fact that they feel they have been "nerfed worse" <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caraddor>Caraddor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/8/02 4:50:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <b><i> Caraddor my point was not that you dont have a clue about mages, but you are in no position to tell us if our epic is easy, or if its hard, how hard it is etc. until you have done it you have no place to tell us about it... we dont try to tell you...</b></i><br>

Again.. I never said it was easy.  I expressed doubt it took over a year to do.<br>

<b><i>Time spent on epic... ok so one of your guild members spent a month and a half and finished his epic, another one spent 2 months... and you can honestly think this is the norm for mages?</b></i><br>
<br>
Stop taking things out of the context of the thread please.  Order of events so far:<br>
 - a mage says it takes over a year for folks to do mage epic<br>
 - I said I doubt it<br>
 - another mage says average time is 6 months<br>
 - I point out that 6 months < 1 year<br>
 - a mage suggests I ask some mages on my server<br>
 - I poll two lvl 60 epic mages in my guild, as requested<br>
 - No one likes the answer, so they say I'm full of @#%$<br>
<br>
I never said two months was the average for any mage to do the epic.  <b>I only said I doubted it took over a year</b>.  That was backed up by another <b>mage</b> that said average time was 6 months.<br>
<br>
<b><i>your 2 month estimate for the mage epic is extremely faulty, and has no truth in it at all... you can not find an estimate by looking at 2 mages you know... a much better estimate would be found by speaking with mages accross the servers... which I have done...</b></i><br>
<br>
Read my response above.. <br>
<br>
<b><i>The point is only that the mage epic is nothing to sit back and say its easy, it can be optained at level 50, and you can buy it all... we dont say that about yours because we dont know first hand, and we'd appreciate if you would extend that same curtousy...</b></i><br>
<br>
It cannot be completely bought, although many pieces can be multiquested.  I would say that makes it similar to yours in that respect (assuming you can't just buy the complete mage epic and you <i>have</i> to do some of it).<br>
<br>
<b><i>Time spent on mage epic is MUCH > Time spent on 9 aa exp points (even 27 if you want to claim those other points did you no good and you were never going to get them anyways)</b></i><br>
<br>
Granted.. although you really should count those points.  It doesn't matter to the game if you want to use the other abilities, but you <b>must</b> spend those points.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Dire charm MUCH > mage epic</b></i><br>
<br>
Debatable.  Scroll back through the thread and you'll find some good points listing pros/cons of a mage summoned pet versus a dire charmed pet.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Mages are supposedly the master of pets...</b></i><br>
<br>
Yes, mages are the master of pets.  Even with dire charm in the game.<br>
<br>
<b><i>those 3 points mean there is a problem with the skill and how it is balanced against mage pets... honestly all most of the mages want is an aa ability that makes our pets this good, or maybe slightly better for 5-10 mins, not permanent, but enough to be of use on uber mobs...</b></i><br>
<br>
Could you list these uber fights for me?  Where dire charm is so useful?  My guild is not uber.  When pets are allowed in a boss mob fight though, they are generally summoned just before the fight (pathing problems are a pain, no argument from me there).  We don't send enchanters/necros/druids running through the zone to find a suitable candidate for dire charm.  Are uber guilds doing that?  I'm thinking Dire Charm is mostly a toy.  Usable for solo or xp groups, not raiding uber mobs.<br>
<br>
<b><i> of the remaining ones most of them want better pets accross the board,</b></i><br>
<br>
I think mage pets are around the power point they should be.  The mage epic pet is <b>not</b> an underpowered useless pet.  I've seen it in action.<br>
<br>
<b><i> then you find a couple mages that are bitter and want dire charm nerfed in some sick way of "getting back" at the chanters for the fact that they feel they have been "nerfed worse"</b></i><br>
<br>
Those are the folks that should be drug out in the street and beaten.  No one ever needs to scream for a nerf.  I honestly can't understand why they do.  They don't like being nerfed themselves, so why wish it on others? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52096">Caraddor</a> (Order of the Scattered Winds)<br>

Time spent working on the epic was around 45 days - 2 months. We'll say 3 months for good measure. Still nowhere close to a year. "<br>
<br>
Ok so 3 months... you took 2 characters and found an estimate of 3 months from them... first thats pretty quick... I've been working on mine much longer then that and am still 3 pieces away....<br>
<br>
even if it was 3 months thats much more effort then dire charm (if you want to say 27 points fine, my point still remains, even tho those points do help you, and anyone getting dire charm would have gotten em anyways...  I guess that would be similiar to a mage counting the time that it took him guilded for his guild to deem him worthy of support for his epic, both times would have been done anyways, and both benefit you in other ways)<br>
<br>
My point is that I dont understand who some of the druids think they are by telling us the mage epic is easy, can be bought and can be gotten at level 50...<br>
<br>
Ok its true you CAN theoretically buy many pieces of the epic... but lets dispell the rumor that this is easy... and if it was it'd prolly take you more time to raise the cash then to get the items<br>
20k peg cloak<br>
250k eart staff<br>
30k water staff<br>
100k air crown<br>
<br>
that right there is 400k, which is gonna take a LONG time... and thats not counting all the rest of it... nobody is gonna farm half of the drops from greenies that you need just to sell em, simply caus nobody is gonna pay for em, they'd rather camp a boring green camp for 5+ hours<br>
<br>
Anyways the point mages have is that our pets are pretty much ok in exp groups... which is mostly where dire charm would take over and completely keep us from finding some groups at times...<br>
<br>
However, our pets are not even summoned on most high end areas (I am always allowed to summon mine but I hear my guild is rare about this... well not in ToV or some areas of hate but thats it)<br>
<br>
We want a way to make our pets useful... I think its an even tradeoff that a chanter can charm a pet forever that is way better then the mage epic, in pretty much every exp zone, and a few raid zones, if then the mages can have that same pet for the 5-10 mins it takes to take down your typical uber mob... (I dont mean Endgame NToV necisarily... more speaking of your more typical stuff at the bottom of that category, vindi, doze, zland maybe, etc.)<br>
<br>
Anyways gonna finally let this die, I think you all know my opinion on the matter, caus I've posted way too much on this thread on your board... my simple request is that if you want to tell a mage his epic is easy, or can be bought, how bout you try it some time, or at least ask around enough to find a decent estimate of time/effort spent... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeyotie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peyotie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/11/02 3:29:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Isnt there some mage AA or spell that grants their pet like 200% haste or some insane amount??<br>

The Refresh Timer for this ability is 72 minutes (One day in game time.).<br>
<br>
First glance that looks pretty good right?  well the pet is *supposed* to blow up at the end doing 1k damage AE... which would be pretty kewl... but as is the pet poofs... so you get a pet with 99% haste (as opposed to 65% which is our best spell, plus 25% from muzzle of mardu), with increased str, AC, and armor class... for 36 seconds... then poof you have to resummon your pet, reequip it with armor if you gave it that, muzzle if you did, and rebuff with burnout, and maybe DS...<br>
<br>
<br>
Tests showed it doing less then 1k damage more in the 36 seconds then not using it... so thats in the 36 seconds you have it, then you lose a bunch of time resummoning/requuiping, not to mention mana, so your 900 or so hps extra that you dealt, is cut down, not exactly sure how far, depends how well you equip your pet... but it is cut down a LOT...<br>
<br>
So for the same price as dire charm we get to do, at most 400-500 damage more then normal, and spend an extra 550-800 mana (400 for pet, 150 for burnout, 155 for muzzle, 155 for DS)<br>
<br>
ya thats some insane 200% haste isn't it? :)<br>
<br>
btw sorry I just HAD to add that in, caus I really hate misinformation<br>
As a guideline if you want to say any kind of thing about the mage class, please look it up at www.magecompendium.com so you dont look like a moron when you say it, because you dont know what your talking about :)<br>

<br>
Actually you did come in spouting numbers... you said "like 200% haste or something"? like that... if you wanted to ask a question you could have said, "What about the mage AA skill, its supposed to make pets great, but I dont know anything about it, what does it really do to them anyways?"  thats a question... your previous one was not really a question and more of saying what you thought was a fact, in the form of a question....<br>
<br>
And no, I'll continue to visit these boards caus despite popular belief there IS useful information about everybody in EQ on class boards that are not your own...<br>
<br>
but yes, thank you for your comments and the name calling... :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 5:02:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26404.topic&index=101>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <b>People are confusing class balance issues that no longer exist post 60 with jealousy of anothers neat parlor tricks. </b><br>
