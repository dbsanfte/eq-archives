<br>
<br>
Departing the Boat from Butcherblock weary in spirit and heart a lone paladin is met bye a hoard of the Freeport guard their weapons drawn and ready he regards them with a steely eye. Looking deep in their ranks he spies a familiar and thought long dead face. Glaring at that individual he spoke <br>
“So Sir Lucan what evil god prizes your soul so highly as to bring you back again and again no matter how many times we slay you?” The lone paladin said. His only response to the question was a sinister laugh and command “Take him!”<br>
<br>
With a weary sigh the paladin Unsheathed his mighty Darkmetal holy water sprinkler with a silent blessing to his patron Rodcet Nife. “If I must go,” he thought, “Then let it be with honor”. With a roar he donned his helm and unslung him shield and charged the overwhelming hoard of guards. The first to reach him went down quickly with a caved in skull the second shattered their weapon and the arm holding it and finished with a quick blow to the head. Now the battle came to swift to see blocking and crushing as fast as he could he feel the battle start to turn to his favor as he pushed towards Sir Lucan last position. Finally nearing there he could see the fiend had dropped his human seeming and stood there in the form of a red glowing eyed lich. Already he could feel the liches' very poisonous magic tapping into the very life force of him soul but he was not deterred. Felling the last guard before him he could see many of the others fleeing out of the corner of his eye. Till the only thing nearby was the evil lich which for some reason was just standing there. Realizing his danger he whirled in time to deflect the blow aimed at his back by the liches’ familiar. As he fought the over powered behemoth he was slowly but surely weakening whether by evil magic or some other means it was very difficult to keep holding his weapon and he struggled to keep standing. <br>
<br>
At last the fiendish pet broke through his guard and knocked his weapon companion of many battles from his hand. Continuing its barrage against his weakening shield he barely felt the blow of force from a nearby cleric in the service of Sir Lucan and the pet followed up with a mighty blow knocking him to the floor. As he hovered in and out consciousness he watched as they approached and stood chanting some evil arcane chant.<br>
<br>
Standing beside him Sir Lucan hands glowed with a sickly green light and held a glowing crystal directly over the his body, The paladin could feel himself drawn in the direction of the light of the crystal and despite his resistance he felt himself pulled closer and closer until the light brightened intensely and that was all he knew.<br>
<br>
The task is done Milord the cleric said to Sir Lucan now holding a brightly-lit crystal of almost pure white. You have trapped this time with no escape milord. Without responding Sir Lucan handed the cleric the crystal with the command “Take this to the plains of the Karanas and bury it where it will never be found. Leaving quickly the cleric took his burden and headed off into the sunset.<br>
<br>
Turning to the body Sir Lucan completed his incantation and the paladin’s lifeless form arose with glowing red eyes and the flesh sheered until all that was the was the skeletal form of a lich which in response to its masters command walked silently into the water and burrowed deeply into the sand to await his call. With a sickly smile Sir Lucan watched the lich and then he too departed leaving the site clear of the living.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
He awoke sensing danger feeling the need to act stretching up his presence only half aware he found an undead hoard savaging a group of adventurers and with a roar he called forth his mighty mace and smashed the legion of undead to the ground. Feeling pain nearby he hovered over the bleeding soul and poured forth more energy until the wounds they had sustained were gone. His task nearly done he turned even more energies and wiped the putrid undead bodies from complete existence and then faded slowly from sight and back into a restless sleep.<br>
Turning to one of his companions was that &quot;yes&quot; his companion replied to his unspoken question? The ghost of Sir Ironwind Dreamseeker that aids travelers of the Karanas, which are in, need. The legends say he is bound here in someway and that someday he will be free to battle evil again. The companions gathered their belongings and departed the area for battles unknown little did they know that the very binding they spoke of lay not 3 feet from the site of the battle so perhaps one day Ironwind will return.<br>
