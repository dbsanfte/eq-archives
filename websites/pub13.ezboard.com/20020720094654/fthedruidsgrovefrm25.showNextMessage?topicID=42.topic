Also Heal yourself as he nukes....you should be able to out heal his nukes, watch out for him using SoL (Shock of Lightning lvl 12 nearly irressitable PvP) to interrupt you.<br>
Depending on your lvl you should dot (swarm tyoe dot irressitable PvP) him too....obviously if you are 53+(not sure if you have updated your sig <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) WD him which if he doesn't dispell should nearly kill him once you have dispelled him.<br>
Depending on your rules of combat....as long as you out heal him even if you both go OOM you can easily out melee him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
The main rule for this fight is that you can heal the dmg he does you you where as any dmg you do he has to live with, so ware him down.<br>
<br>
Before the fight make sure you buff yourself fully.....cast crap buffs like STR, Firefist, Thorncoat first and then PR and DR (these don't matter against a wizzie!)... followed by See invis, Regen, FR, CR, SLN, SOW, MR<br>
You can change this buffage dependant on whether you are allowed to buff pre the fight...but I am assuming as the wizzie had a Skin he prebuffed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
If he does deside to dispell you to lower your resists and get rid of sow...then he has to get threw all the crap first.<br>
<br>
Also depending on the situation, if you have fought him before and he pumices your dots alot....then mem Harmony for the combat....cast this on him before doting him, means he has to dispell Harmony before he can get rid of the dot...every little helps!<br>
<br>
Good Luck...wizzie are a pest but Druids are the masters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

<br>
In an arena battle where fleeing is not an option you should win every time with this method.<br>
<br>
If you're allowed to buff beforehand and be at full mana, buff in an order like this.<br>
<br>
2 instant cast items e.g.<br>
Jboots<br>
Telescope (made by tinker skill)<br>
see invis<br>
str<br>
resist poison<br>
resist disease<br>
thorncoat line<br>
circle of summer<br>
circle of winter<br>
resist magic<br>
Chloroplast<br>
Skin like nature<br>
<br>
That should just about cover you.<br>
<br>
As he removes 2 buffs, recast your jboots and telescope instantly (thus making his dispels much less effective)<br>
<br>
If there is just a 30 second buff period, i'd probably not bother buffing and save your mana, although you may want to throw up your instant cast buffs (if instant cast items are allowed), maybe see invis, endure magic, resist fire, resist cold.<br>
<br>
As another poster suggested, buy pumice stones, it saves the mana you'll use to dispel someone, and there is no recast time on pumice either.<br>
<br>
Essential item - ES arms or Velious armour bracer.<br>
If he's around the same level as you, he has ice comet, but no lure spells - so stack up on CR gear and try and get as much FR as you can - frog crown is a very good item, as are diamond mask/rings.<br>
<br>
Tactics.<br>
Heal his damage.<br>
Your heals are better and more mana efficient than his nukes, heal the damage he deals to you.<br>
<br>
Use your free casting arm dot to do damage to him until he is OOM.<br>
<br>
Just sit tight and heal the damage, as he has no where to run (i believe you said you're fighting in the arena), he will eventually run OOM and you should have at least some left (this will depend on how good your resists are).<br>
<br>
If your low on mana when he's oom, keep using your arm dot, and melee him to death, if he melee's you back (even tho you have more skill and will beat him anyway, you may want to cast thorns.)<br>
<br>
If you have quite alot of mana left, use ro's sundering to drop his FR, then let off a few nukes.<br>
<br>
Don't waste time on breath of ro or winged death if you level and get them, any good dueller will know to dispel these dots straight away. (besides breath of ro is very easily resisted)<br>

You can run out of range easily.  <br>
<br>
1.  Immediately get out of range of wizard<br>
2.  Start casting you Creeping Crud line dot, hitting button as you inch towards wiz.  As soon as you are in casting range, they are in casting range of you too (but out of range of his roots).  Stay in that casting range (barely close enough to cast your dot on him), dont get close enough for him to root you. <br>
3.  Let him hit you with a DD from that range (or two).  Then run out of range, and heal yourself.  <br>
4.  Do this again, and again, till he doesnt cast on you anymore, (get him close to oom). <br>
5.  You will have about 2 bubs mana left when he goes oom(usually), because your heals are much more efficient than his DDs. <br>
6.  Move in and start meleeing wiz down, once he is oom or close to it. If you have enough mana left, dispell his skin, and then throw a dot on him while you are beating him down.  <br>

<br>
Do you guys realise how easy it is to resist root.<br>
<br>
Or how silly it is to cast dots that cost mana in duels that are dispellable with a pumice/nullifyspells ?<br>
<br>
Or even how easy it is to resist blizzard or step out of them when they're being cast ?<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Duels against a caster involve mana efficiency, blizzard/dots and wasting mana trying to snare/root someone who is gearred for pvp is futile, and so what if you get rooted - its not like its a big deal for you even if the spell should somehow magically land past the lowbie mr thats required to resist it - i mean whats a wizard going to do to you if he snares/roots you ? melee you ? heh yeah ok.......<br>

<br>
I lost the first couple of fights in the arena by trying to sit there toe to toe and heal faster than the wiz can nuke (it doesnt happen, you will die doing this).  <br>
<br>
I won the next few fights by doing what I posted above, and havent lost to a wiz within 5 levels of me since.  Just run to the edge of your dot range, and let him hit you with a DD, run OUT of range, SO YOU CAN GET YOUR HEAL OFF, otherwise, you wont be able to get your heal off in time (you MUST run out of range) wizards have fast casting DD's and fast casting stuns that will get to you before you can get your heals off, unless you run out of range.   GET IT?  Good.  <br>
<br>
The key is staying just on the edge of casting range, taking a hit (ie, draining the wiz's mana), and running out of range and healing yourself.  Your heals are more mana efficient than the wiz's dd's, you will run him oom that way.  When the wiz is oom, he is like a dog with no teeth.  <br>

<br>
Anyway at lvl 51 you most likely won't be fighting against lures.<br>
<br>
If you're having trouble outhealing a wizards normal nukes - ice-comet etc, you need to spend sometime getting resist equipment - to fight pvp unprepared is a foolhardy mistake, you don't go against PvE mobs like nagafen without good resists, why would you fight a wizard who's sole offensive abilitys are within his elemental nukes with low resists ?<br>
<br>
Same applies if you're still getting rooted.<br>
<br>
And fighting an arena duel (botb style) I'd believe range dancing isn't an option, unless your talking the entire arena zone of course - in any case if you come half prepared you have no need to. <br>

Im not Peoni, but banishment on pet/or banishment of undead(2 charge easy quest, part of the tunare root necklace) (or root)<br>
<br>
dispell / cure dots, every time he uses a dot on you, he will loose 200-400 mana on it, while you use max 50 on the cure.<br>
(in case of bond of death, dispell both of you)<br>
<br>
<br>
Lifetaps, they might seem scary, but if you analyze em a bit, they are no where near as effective as heals. (imagine a starfire split in two, half of it heals, half of it damages, if no mana is spent on damaging him, he´s wasting it, since he´s only casting a half assed nuke for the same mana)<br>
<br>
dealing damage with melee, and saving mana on cure/dispell healing is the key versus a necro, if you nuke him, your feeding him. <p><p><B>Tetrian Corbec</B><br>60 Druid

Winged death cost a lot yeah sux when dispeled but wiz are so weak so it can be worth. Depend of many things.<br>
