<br>
Esp since if I am healing I am in all likelihood chain casting heals.<br>
<br>
On the actual effect thank you for the clarification.  I misinterpreted what the tanks were gibbering about when I asked them exactly what this does and I think all they said was &quot;it is like your AC is raised.&quot;<br>
<br>
If has roughly the same effect even if the AC stat is not directly effected, right?  Granted the max hit does not decrease like it would with AC I guess, but the average melee dmg you take goes down.  So it is LIKE you have higher ac...<br>
<br>
Would love to know if anyone has any ideas on testing the benefit of the ability.  I suppose you could have someone who has zero levels of it melee some blue mob a bit and log the dmg for a fixed period of time (so you don't die and stuff)...do that several times on the same type of mob.  Then buy the first level of the skill and do the same number of tests on the same mob type and record the dmg results, and compare.<br>
<br>
Should be possible from there to extrapolate the benefit of the upper two levels if you can quantify what 2% means for you.  Then just share the results along with some key stats (your buffed ac and hp perhaps) and figure it out from there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 8/15/02 8:08:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulittlun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Littlun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333399>(8/15/02 8:30:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28171.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Improved Natural Durability Vs Combat Stability </span><hr size=1> Hmmmm.<br>

Almost EVERY answer here is along the lines of &quot;if I get aggro I'm dead; No good druid would ever get aggro anyways and if you do you suck!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well, guess what!  We're NOT all VT, ST raiding druids.  No.  Really.  I'm a plain vanilla level 56 druid who takes hits now and then.  Sometimes because we messed up, sometimes because a chanter's charm broke and everyone else is busy, or the cleric went LD and we have to chain heal, or sometimes just 'cause!<br>
<br>
The question was... Which of the 2 are better.  In that case I would pick the extra hp.  &quot;Just wear an extra 55hp ring&quot;, I hear.  OK.  So I'm wearing one.  What next?  Hp are not only good for melee damage (great for PBAoE for you soloing types as well), but also are good against AoE damage.  However mitigating damage from melee is ONLY good against melee damage.  For that reason I'd choose HP &gt; DM (damage mitigation) because it is more versatile.  But I would still rank both of them above improved metabolism for us foragers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , for example.<br>

Don't buy that hype Littlun.<br>
<br>
I am a raiding druid.  I get hit all the time.  My view is, if I'm doing all the different things that I can do as a druid, I will aggro.  Nothing can stop that.  Debuffs, Nukes, Heals.  Wham bam, I just tanked the Elite Ma'am.<br>
<br>
If you want me to dish our a few k of damage on the mob, while healing a few K of damage on my party, and debuffing the mob so everyone else lay a lil smackdown on its @#%$.  Don't bitch at me when you see &quot;You will not Evade me Aidon&quot;.  Especially when 95% of the time I survive with relative ease.  This &quot;Druids shouldn't get aggro and be hit ever&quot; is an outdated mode of thought.  A relic from the days when we were lucky to have 2khp buffed.  When I have more HP/AC than my warrior does now or ever did, I can take a few hits to put out that much more healing/nuking. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">

I have Exodus, Innate Camo, SCM3, HG2 and ND 1 now.<br>
<br>
I'm going to max out ND before putting points into SCF and maybe even before SCF I'll work on CS.<br>
<br>
I stand at approximately 4703 hp raid buffed with 1083 ac.  ND3 will get me close to 4950 HP.<br>
<br>
That's more hp then some rangers and bards in my guild fully buffed.  It's more hp then a level 60 warrior with Full Indolocite, Cobalt or Thurg armor with no ND.<br>
<br>
I think these 2 AA's are good skills for me and I'll be getting them quickly.<br>

<br>
<br>
This is another misconception.  People buy way too much into the 'script' on how to play a druid, which usually says &quot;never get hit&quot;.  Imo good Druids get hit occasionally, we're talking about the active ones that are constantly on the edge of aggro, and they know what i'm talking about.  You get a gauge of where the aggro line is, and your constantly nuking along that fine line, sometimes getting aggro briefly, but as long as you stay along that fine line of aggro and not crossing too far into it, its easy to shake off.  Another reason good Druids get hit are from debuffs.  Early debuffing usually ends up where you take a shot or two especially if your the one on RSD.  If your pulling your gonna take some hits as well.<br>
<br>
For really big tough boss mobs, i'm sure people play it safer, but for stuff thats become routine, i'm sure people play with that aggro line and its no big deal.  People say a druid wastes mana of the cleric if he gets hit, but i dont believe clerics are focusing on the druid to heal, even then its usually so minimal nobody bothers healing the druid but himself.  The only thing thats taboo imo is pong, but its easily prevented by nuking in aggro range, something i still see alot of druids not doing.  If yoru a Druid getting aggro your just responsbile for yourself, and i do fine playing with that fine line of aggro.  I might get healed, but its just from a patcher with an itchy trigger finger because i lost a bub of health even tho my fungi + regrwoth would patch it up w/o any worries.<br>
<br>
In general exp groups, getting aggro is nothing unless your doing CT.  Even then you can play with the line and take a few shots, before your MT gets aggro back, its really no big deal.  When i have good mana regen in exp groups, i'm constantly getting aggro, but the mobs are going down twice as fast.  Then again, the mobs dont hit too hard when their slowed and yoru 60 in many exp spots so it really doesnt even matter.  I can take less damage than 56-57 warriors MT'ing in some exp groups.  If your root/parking your guaranteed in getting hit some, frequently if your doing it the whole night.  <br>
<br>
Personally, i almost always have a 40hp/tick regen on me and i feel its a waste if i dont put it to use.  Maybe thats why i think so much of a fungi.  I've never had a complaint getting aggro nuking mobs dead in exp groups.  Because the end result ends up being i dont take too much damage because the mob dies so fast from multiple nukes(starting nukes early).  <br>
<br>
Basically, if you know what your doing getting hit isnt a big deal.  If you dont know what your doing w/ regards to aggro then getting hit will get you killed.  I know some people here feel a druid should never get hit, but there are conservative druids that just patch, and then you have the druids that patch, debuff, dot, and nuke.  Some druids tend to be more active than others, i've seen it for myself, and its just a style of play.  I'm not saying any one type of druid is better, but i am saying getting hit is overrated, dont believe the hype.  As long as you know where the aggro line is, dont cross too far into it unless you can get teh mob killed quick, your fine.<br>

Combat Stability just raises the druidic mitigation cap by 10%.  Bear in mind the how large the druidic mitigation cap is, and then compare that tiny wee increase in effectiveness to a huge lump of multifunctional hit points.  ^_))<br>
