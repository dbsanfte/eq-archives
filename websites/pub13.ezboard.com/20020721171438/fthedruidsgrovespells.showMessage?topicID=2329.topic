My immediate thought is that "spiking" is abjuration, not alteration.  Though I agree that Alteration is the best choice overall for specialization, for reasons that have been repeated in countless threads on this board (such as <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showMessage?topicID=2261.topic>this</a> one). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utrueblayde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trueblayde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/16/01 7:15:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specialization issues and debate</span><hr size=1> Just so you know, you can change your specialization by doing a quest in the temple of ro, atleast you used to be able to, maybe they changed it.

And which of the two you choose, evocation or alteration, between 30 and 60 depends on your particular style of play.  If you spend a lot of time grouping and playing a wannabe cleric, then choose alteration.  If you spend a significant amount of time quad-kiting, then go with evocation.  If you root-DoT, it really doesn't matter (although keep in mind that Breath of Ro is evocation).<br>

   Where ever most of your mana goes, there goeth your specialization.  Not number of casts, but total mana cost.  Unless you do something most of the rest of us don't, that's either going to be Evocation (for nukes) or Alteration (for heals, roots, snares, strength, and ports).<br>
<br>
   Since druids are versatile, there's no one right answer.  Even in a group, you might wind up nuking.  Even solo, you'll wind up Altering.<br>
<br>
   The overall effect is fairly minor (about 10% mana cost saved on average at max skill), so it's not really a determining choice either way.  An inclination, an advantage, not a crippling effect if you make the &quot;wrong&quot; choice.<br>

   Baelish over at Casters' Realm seems to have conducted some conversations with Geoffery Zatkin about it.  Here's the way he describes specialization (dating back to a year ago, about the time they implemented the skill):<br>
<br>
<br>
How does it work?<br>
<br>
When a spell is cast a roll is thrown to see if it receives the specialisation bonus.  The higher your specialisation skill the more likely it is the roll will succeed, and the greater the benefit of the roll.  A successful roll will do two things:<br>
<br>
It will reduce the mana used on the spell. <br>
It will reduce the chance of fizzling. <br>
An unsuccessful roll will merely cause you to cast the spell with normal mana cost and fizzle chance.<br>
<br>
Note:  It has been confirmed by Geoffrey Zatkin, the Arch-Magi at Verant that:<br>
<br>
Specialisation does not increase chance of recovering after interruption.  This is based purely on Channelling <br>
Specialisation does not make spells cast faster.  This is a fixed amount.<br>
<br>
There's also a mention in discussing spell recovery:<br>
<br>
Here it is as much information as I have been able to acquire in relation to spell recovery. All information has been confirmed by GZ.<br>
Your chance to recover casting is calculated solely on your Channelling Skill. <br>
Dexterity only affects Channelling in relation to raising your skill in it. How quickly your raise your Channelling ability is determined by a combination of Dexterity and Intelligence. <br>
Dexterity does not affect your chance to actually recover casting. <br>
Agility doesn't affect Channelling, or casting recovery in any way whatsoever. <br>
If you cast a spell which you are 5 or more levels higher than when you obtained it (eg: root is a level 4 spell, so if you are level 9 or higher) you get a Channelling boost, ie: a higher chance to recover casting if interrupted. <br>
Player controlled movement will, in most circumstances, break a spell with no chance to recover. <br>
Movement caused by a monster hitting you while you are casting a spell gets a chance to recover the casting. <br>
Your skill level in a specific type of spell (eg: Evocation) doesn't affect your chance of recovery. However, this will affect your chance to fizzle the spell. <br>
Any Specialization skill you have in the type of spell being cast will not affect recovery, however it will have a chance to reduce mana cost, and lower the fizzle rate. <br>
 <br>
--<br>
<br>
The obvious test would be to go OOM (within 5 points, since we've got cheap spells), wait with a known med rate until you had 85% mana for an expensive spell, and try to cast it.  See how often it works.  If spec always reduces mana costs, you'll always succeed at the proper mana level.  If spec sometimes reduces mana costs, you'll only sometimes succeed, and sometimes get the insufficient mana message.  (And the percentage chance of succeeding times the mana savings should work out to the average savings.)  Or, as occasionally been reported, spec only gives you mana back after you cast, you'll never succeed unless you wait until 100% mana before casting.<br>
<br>
Such a test would best be done at high level, so you can use spells that are very expensive with respect to the mana regeneration rate, so the precise timing and inability to go exactly OOM won't matter so much to the results.  Unfortunately, that wouldn't give you a good idea of the curve at Spec 30, or 100, instead of just maxed.  Even mid-levels should do, though, as long as you aren't medding and have no mana regen spells up.<br>
<br>
The test can be repeated for an actual specialization, as well as an off skill where skill is capped 50, to try and measure a couple of known points.<br>
<br>
Anyone that bored to try it?<br>

<br>
It will never work. You MUST have the required mana for a spell before you can even attempt to cast it. Specialization may or may not kick in and save you back some of that mana, but that's only after the fact.<br>

<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
First, GZ said so.  :)  If you look at <a href=http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=457>this</a> old tibit from the Caster's Realm news page, you'll see that the spellcaster's primary stat (INT or WIS) affects the chance of a successful specialization skill roll.<br>
<br>
Second, when I tested specialization way, way back (even before GZ's comment), I found approximately 10% savings with 200 specialization versus 50 specialization.  Interestingly, though, when I ran the 50 specialization test twice, my mana bar looked different at the end of each test:<br>
<br>
<img src=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/mana.jpg><br>
<br>
Bars 1 and 3 were the states after 10 castings of Alteration (200 skill), and Bars 2 and 4 were the states after 10 castings of Evocation (50 skill).  Both the Alteration and Evocation tests used the same base mana cost spell with similar casting times.  I think I meditated to full, cast 10 spells in a row, then instantly took a screenshot, and repeated.<br>
<br>
Sure, it's just 1 pixel, but since I ran the tests exactly the same way and there was no lag, it leads me to believe there might be a difference and GZ might have been right. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/19/01 3:23:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/19/01 8:49:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What evidence is there for anything?</span><hr size=1> Heh, you and I both know that what GZ says (or said) isn't really evidence. More of an indication of what was intended. I was aware of that statement at EQ Casters, but I was looking for hard evidence. <br>
<br>
However, your screenshots ARE good hard evidence...:)  <br>
<br>
My approach was slightly different. What I did for my tests was to attempt to find the actual % reduction.  I did this by dropping all buffs, standing up, running mana down to 0 (or close), then attempting to cast as my mana slowly recharged.  As soon as the cast went off with a high mana evoc. spell (and it left a good amount of mana afterwards, thus providing confirmation that the casting check is based on the listed mana, not the actual mana post-reduction), I then cast another, non-evocation spell to use up the rest (I tried to bracket it by casting something a little too high in mana cost followed by something a bit under).  That's how I derived my reduction of 15% per cast at max specialization.  (There are several sources of error, including the mana reduction on the non-evoc. spells, hence the &quot;approx 15%&quot; result.)<br>
<br>
As I noted, in 30 some tests, I got the same reduction each time.  As I posted at the time, either there was no skill check, or the chance of failure was so low at maxxed spec. that we could effectively assume that the mana reduction would occur each cast.  The latter interpretation is supported by your data.<br>
<br>
Your data matches mine if we assume that the chance of failing to make the check at max. specialization is pretty low (5% or less...Verant seems to like to use 5% as their minimum).  At a spec. skill level of 50, the chance of failure would be significantly higher, giving the results you document.  With 10 casts per test, you most likely were successful with all 10 for your alteration specialization, thus giving the same final mana as observed.<br>

<br>
That would be my best guess.  Note that the two Alteration lines are identical.  Also note that when I ran those tests with my shaman aeons ago (around June of 1999), my wisdom stat was around 165.  GZ said that higher WIS would cause specialization to roll successfully more often, so perhaps that could be one possible explanation for the consistency in your results (I presume you have a higher WIS stat).<br>
<br>
Perhaps you might want to lower your WIS to its base value and test again.  This may not only have the effect of encouraging the theorized specialization "failures", but will also give added precision to mana bar movements (because of the lower total mana). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umulerin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulerin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/1/01 11:07:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specialization issues and debate</span><hr size=1> bump <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaibbinm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MaibbinM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/4/01 1:16:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specialization issues and debate</span><hr size=1> Sorry another question regarding specialization.  <br>

I just turned 30 and decided without much thought (I know, my bad!)to specialize in Evo.  Well after much debate with my roommate and much brow beating...I have decided I made a mistake.  I have read here that you can change your specialization by going to the temple of Solusek Ro, but I was wondering since I have not yet reached the magical level of 50 on my specialization if I can change it without doing the quest.  Can I just use a training point at level 31 and change it to alter and get my alter spec to 50 first?<br>

Sorry for the poor wording of above.  Hopefully someone understands my question.  <br>

<br>
In fact, you couldn't &quot;specialize&quot; in evocation unless you also put one point in all of the other specializations.  Eventually, all of your specialization skills will reach 50, except for the one that first reaches 51 (which will go on to 200).  That latter one is what people refer to as their &quot;specialization,&quot; although it really is the one that they super-specialize in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upatofnaud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>patofnaud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/7/01 7:24:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specialization issues and debate</span><hr size=1> Ok, great timing on this one, I just hit 30 yesterday.<br>
<br>
I SOLO a LOT with my Druid. If I wanted to group I play my Rogue. SO, I chose EVO myself.<br>
<br>
The thing I did was only put a a point in Specialize Evo, untill I can get it up to 51 THEN I'll put points in all other catagories.<br>
<br>
Is this how you make sure the correct skill is THE skill you master? <p><body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>

<br>
And yes, this is one such way to make sure you &quot;specialize&quot; in the skill you want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showPrevMessage?topicID=2329.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showNextMessage?topicID=2329.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2329.topic&index=17><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.emailToFriend?topicID=2329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.threadControl?topicID=2329.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2329.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2329.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells>Spells</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
