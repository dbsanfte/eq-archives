<br>
This is for you Dakkar.  I found it.  I won an award with it, from EQNecro, but they never gave it to me, the bastids.....  Anyway, here it is.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Recluse’s Testimony<br>
<br>
An Explanation<br>
<br>
This short testimony was found tattered and dirty in the bottom of a great steel chest which was discovered in the moors outside our hamlet after the recent explosion which brought down screaming from the ramparts of his rotting tower a great and most foul man.  It is unfortunate that we were unable to arrive in the area of the cataclysm earlier, as it apparently brought the small village only two wheels from the Tower to ruin as well, and there were no survivors due to our assumption that the neighboring village would send us word of the destruction, and if our help was needed.  We had no idea the magnitude of the destruction which was wrought. It is most distressing that we were unable to find the body of the monstrous being who lived there as well: our tardiness to come to the aid of the village gave the beasts of the swamps ample time to drag away the dead before they were offered a sacred burial, sanctified by our Lord.  He will forgive us our wrongs, I pray, and in the name of scholarly interest I have published these words, written by the very same nameless dweller of the now-demolished tower.  May these words aid the most sacred task of routing such forces from our Lord's world.<br>
-Frederich D'Estain, Sage.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Testimony<br>
<br>
<br>
I write now the last words these fingers shall ever scribe upon paper, and of this fact I am most pleased.  As my work is done, my need for this world ends with it - I only leave these few words in a momentary lapse of mortal pride which apparently surfaced itself in these few moments of my remaining humanity.  I leave a short testimony here,  a short telling of the path I traveled to reach this final moment, this final end to the shackles which held me since I was forced from the secret places where the human soul dwells before conception and onto this most imperfect world. <br>
<br>
It is my task to remove those shackles from all living things, to liberate the spirit from the flesh, and to wield the world against itself; to bring about the inevitable Force which perennially seeks to put down this momentary rebellion against the void, known as Life.  And in these few moments before my return to the void, I leave this work.<br>
<br>
My birth, my youth, is for the most part inconsequential to my tale.  I was forced from my village at a young age and into the moors for a host of acts which were not of my doing.  The Elders of our village said they saw something in me which was contrary to their stale morality.  I suppose the desecration of their ugly, empty sod chapel was easily blamed upon me, as no other dweller of our town was nearly free-willed enough to ever assume that the gods were false.  Their fists and cruelty drove me from my home and into the fens, alone and left to die by the vicious teeth of those beasts which dwell there.  They claimed it was the only place for a human as dark-hearted as I was.  While I do not necessarily agree with the &quot;gentility&quot; they demonstrated in my forced expulsion, I have no reason to disagree with that belief.  These swamps nurtured me more lovingly than my own neglectful, long-dead kin.               <br>
<br>
For many days I wandered the eternal darkness of the moors, the sounds of the beasts and the soft whisperings of the swamp’s decay soothing my loneliness, my aching belly.  There was no food, no shelter, no warmth there; only the chill of the night wind and the insidious glimmer of swamplight, and I was utterly defenseless before it.   Wan and wasted from exposure and starvation, I collapsed there on the soggy peat moss, and the rotten water welcomed me into the fetid tomb it had prepared for me.  As I succumbed to its corrosive touch, I looked to the vaulted heavens once more, preparing to meet those false idols the backward peasants of my homeland worshipped with all the disdain a dying man can muster.  At that moment I felt a presence: I felt Her.  The whole world became as coal, black and dully glimmering.  The scraps and tattered remains of shadows which had flocked to the moors left their places in nature and swarmed around my fallen form like so many  benighted insects preparing to rest, to feed on a decaying corpse.  They waltzed before my stricken eyes, shrouded beings with blackened lips which  breathed lightless fire over me.  I heard Her then, Her soft voice cascading over me sweetly, fully, both setting my soul to fire and to a numbing chill.  Her ashen wings enveloped me, Her arms of  charred ivory upheld me, and I could feel Her penetrating the pores of my skin with the very eternity of Her being.<br>
<br>
I will not repeat the words She spoke to me as She bore me above the stink of those grave-filled lands - Her ebon hair and eyes of void-blasted starlight forbid me from ever speaking Her words with these imperfect lips, or writing in this imperfect language.  But the force of the secrets She whispered in my ear drove me forward until at last I found the place She had created for me in a time before the sun burned and the moon was bathed in corpse-light. I was destined for this Tower, and for me only will its secrets be relinquished.  And they have been given to me: the musty tomes which clustered the blackened iron bookshelves of the tower filled my soul with a strangeness, a peculiarity which absorbed most of the more base human emotions I once felt.  I learned the forbidden arts there, and every morning I rose to find food and drink at the door to my chambers, and every day I read more.  I learned Sarcomancy first: the art controlling flesh that has fortunately lost its animating force.  I stood upon the roof of the Tower and cried out the words of the tomes, and legions opened their lips and answered me with cries that would have turned any other mortal’s heart to a useless pulp of battered flesh.  I watched them rise before me there, in the places where they last breathed, where they fell to earth, and I knew Sarcomancy, I knew fear and the mindless, colossal force behind the walking dead.  Last came the forbidden art of Necromancy, the most powerful and deadly of all arts.  I learned to speak to those things I raised up from mouldy earth, those things which never should have walked again.  Oh, the things one learns from the dead!  For a time I left the Tower, and with the shadows enveloping me like a cloak, I walked into the lands of mortal men.  There were those holy men who saw through the shadows gathered around me, and with their gods and prayers dared to exorcise me.  Their desiccated husks still adorn my study, their white armour flaking with rust and their holy words fallen dumb upon their dried lips.  Poor fools…<br>
<br>
        I no longer eat anymore.  I have stopped sleeping.  I no longer need to breathe: the cyclopean writings of those musty books feed my stomach, rest my mind in my body’ stead, fill my lungs with cold fire.  I returned to the village where I was born, and filled the huts with death and the desolate wailings of those not yet allowed to die, but left still to suffer this earth longer than any should.  Jackals roam the streets of that place, and the elders walk about mindless, with bared bones and tangled beards, their idols forgotten, their sage prophecies as withered as their skin.  I gained nothing from this but a sense of perverse irony.  They were right to fear me, only because they themselves cast me to this fate.<br>
<br>
I have not left the tower in some time now.  My spirits of the grave have returned there, spent from lack of use.  My days of entering the wide, wild world with the shadows crying out for slaughter are over - I no longer thirst for blood.   I found another book, you see: a little scrap of a thing hidden under the floorboards in the basement of the Tower.  I have read it countless times since then, divining from it unimaginable secrets which must have fallen from the inky crevices of the night sky, as they are by no means earthly.  In my study I have found a great secret pulled from the tombs and crumbling sepulchers of all the world, a thing which never breathed, yet still walks upon the soil tireless and eternal.  I know the components.  I have spent innumerable decades preparing ritual objects -  this drink, this cask of star-steel and bones, this empowered area which I myself called to being upon the roof of my Tower. I have called upon those spirits who govern life and death beyond the bounds of mortal existence, divined the planets with a handful of thrown bones, communed with HER, and I know the date when all these things can be called upon to transform my very being into a force of pure will, no longer needing this sack of water and slime to manipulate the pages of a book which only conveys secrets from this side of reality.  I will be that secret, that knowledge that all Her servants lust for.  And I shall be Her consort in those hateful places where She walks.   <br>
<br>
The time is set.  Let these be my last written words.  I shall walk the violet twilight and feast upon the breath of any living being I choose to feed from.  I am a Necromancer, and I am soon to be the Lich.  May the balance of Life and Death be thrown into upheaval at my ascension!<br>
