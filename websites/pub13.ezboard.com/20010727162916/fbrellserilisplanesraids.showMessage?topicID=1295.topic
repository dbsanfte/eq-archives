When it was amazing for anyone to take down any one of them, or to successfully break into a Plane.  Currently there is a lot of angst and anxiety that the more powerful guilds on the server are trying to take away the rights of the less powerful ones.  What many people don't seem to understand is that when a powerful guild has regular access to a resource, it will make complete use of that resource and then move on to the next.  What this means is that while people are concerned that A_Uberguild00 is going to excessively raid a plane/zone/ubermob for all eternity, the truth is that if A_Uberguild00 actually DOES excessively raid any plane/zone/ubermob, (and that hasn't really been a problem so much on this server) it will probably A) Have most of the things it needs from there before most other people are even able to efficiently raid in it, B) In the process of pioneering the Plane/zone/UberMob, they learn how it works and eventually teach it to others.  I know for a fact that our server would not be where it is without the help of some very talented players and guilds.  Individual effort has played a massive part in the development of strategy and tactics, and that effort is often forgotten later when the glamour is gone and all that is left is a horde of bickering people trying to cut the biggest slice of the cake for themselves.  I wonder if in a few months, the shouts of anger and conspiracy will be about places such as the Sleepers Tomb, or the Plane of Mischief...or dare I say, Veeshans Peak?  These places have not been fully pioneered yet on our server, in the first two cases, they haven't even been entered.  I guarantee you it will be one of the &quot;powerguilds&quot; on our server who enters them first, explores them, is abused miserably in them, and eventually learns them.  Once learned they are sure to share their knowledge, (as they always have) allowing other guilds and groups of people to begin raiding there...is that when the accusations and the flames will start all over again?  Is that when those who spent countless hours figuring out the intricacies of a new area will be shunned by their peers for wanting to spend a little time there to reap the rewards of their efforts?  <br>
<br>
I just wanted to share my thoughts over this veritable war that seems to have arisen with the new lands out there.  I say that to put reservations on things before they have been fully pioneered will drastically slow down the continued growth and evolution of our server.  Velious should for now at least, be left out of it.  I have enough faith in the spirit of our server to believe that it will not degenerate to a bunch of KSing, backstabbing Uberguilds and secret alliances, just because we aren't all standing in line to receive our regularly scheduled Uberations.  <br>

Actually I'm still bitching about maintaining the old world reservation system for the most part. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kunark and SoV are completely different animals IMHO, how they should be treated no idea to be honest lots of good arguments out there. Pesonally some mobs are on such messy timers I wouldn't see how to reserve them for all fairly anyway we slice 'em.<br>
<br>
I agree that the power guilds are trail blazers and its laudible how they share thier knowledge with the rest of us. <br>
<br>
However there are certain individuals that are members of those guilds that go out of thier way to rub it into others faces show us all how great they are and all knowledgable and my twink has twin lams and a fungi, nos blah blah blah... using a High school euphemism; Guild A is the Brell football team thier quarterback tells the Leader of Guild B(The Chess Club) stay away from our field(VS) because you guys obviously can't play football as good as us so have no rights to have it reserved of course the soccer team Guild C and Baseball team Guild D all agree with A. Give the Chess club enough time they may not play as well as the football team but they can get on the field and make a showing. Overly simplistic yes but its how some people around here come off when you read what they post. <br>
<br>
VS reservations are over camped. There is no debating that, thats fact are there simple solutions to it maybe, maybe not.<br>
<br>
I will guarentee this some of those people on that list are there more to piss off the football team then to take that mob down. The more you tell people no the more they are going to push, human nature at its finest some call it jealousy, spite or revenge.<br>
<br>
How do you resolve the whole damn mess you sit down you talk it over. Main problem we have many people are talking and only hearing what they want to hear or more to the point only listening to who they think should have a voice you can tell who skips posts on this board real easy. <br>
<br>
I will repeat that is going to come back and bite someone one of these days.<br>
<br>
Someone threw out an interesting tidbit the other day that got me thinking. <br>
<br>
There are a few planes capable guilds with 100+ members what would happen if they decided to post thier idea for handling a reservation for something up here and thier Guild leader was treated poorly or flamed for daring to post or even worse say they reserved FGs and someone didn't bother to check the reservations on the day that the big guild was raiding. <br>
<br>
What would be there response What should it be?<br>
<br>
Just something to think about. <p><BR>Mavrin Azureblade<BR>

<br>
i've been raiding planes for months when planes werent camped like they are now, and yes it was a blast to keep killing repops because we didnt have to worry about the next raid<br>
<br>
when kunark was new it was easy to just pick a zone and lead a raid there, that was a blast as well<br>
<br>
but because i was able to do that before because i only had to share with a few people/guilds doesnt mean it's still doable now<br>
<br>
Kaiyn has a point, powerful raid machines (sounds better than uberguild huh ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) will eventually move on from a spot... but how long before they dont need gear from trak anymore ? <br>
<br>
when there is pretty much noone to compete with, sure, raid it like you want, and set up any system you want<br>
i dont want to set rules on how a guild should behave when they dont interfere with another<br>
<br>
however when you have 10, 20 guilds able to raid a zone, you cant just ignore the others<br>
<br>
you dont have to respect an intention, it's only a notice that a raid plans on being there, but then why going too if you can avoid it ?<br>
there is still a lot of zones you can go to<br>
<br>
the dain, the giant king...<br>
they are exactly like they should be for now, FFA<br>
if some day raids are sheduled to kill them regulary by several different guilds/indies, then imo they should be reservable<br>
but for now ? rofl no way<br>
<br>
growth is easy, i wont argue with that, but are fear and hate hard ? so why would one be different ?<br>
it respawns slower... because it's bigger<br>
but it doesnt take much longer to clear than fear back when it was a challenge (remember the 14 hours raids anyone ?)<br>
and growth is raided more than fear was at the time<br>
<br>
nothing stops you from allowing another guild to come in, or ask another guild if they dont mind sharing<br>
<br>
adapting the reservation system ? sure why not, no problems with that, but making it FFA FCFS or whatever just because it favors your guild is just plain stupid<br>
<br>
i've always thought it was greedy and arrogant (not saying that for you kaiyn, just a general remark) to say &quot;we could be killing everything on the server but we are not because we're nice, so we are helping to set up a reservation system&quot;<br>

<br>
No one entity on this server could kill everything.  If they could, they certainly wouldn't set up a system that takes away from their opportunities.  <br>
<br>
If I understand your argument correctly, I think it's unfair to suggest that the larger guilds are being greedy without admitting to the smaller guild's motivations to sign up for every list regardless if they have the numbers to support a raid or not.<br>
<br>
We're all greedy.  To suggest that any of us are not is pure sophistry.  So, assuming that we are all, indeed, greedy, let's base our arguments off something more tangible.<br>

<br>
of course it's obvious that every guild or person of brell wants a system that favors them<br>
<br>
but honestly, who would benefit it if brell was going FFA or FCFS ? (for the common zones i mean, i dont care much of specific rotations when there's only 2-3 guilds doing the zones)<br>
the powerful guilds, of course<br>
<br>
it was annoying for me too not to be able to just gather friends and go rush a zone<br>
but put yourself in the position of a *lesser* guild, gathering enough people for a raid is not as easy, and you cant make them all follow you if you want to move on to another zone<br>
<br>
it IS greedy to change the system to allow you (you = anyone, not just you) to raid whatever you want and make other people's life tougher<br>
<br>
there are lots of other zones a powerful guild can raid and where they wont have to compete with other guilds<br>
but for the crowded places, well even if it's not as fun you gotta foillow rules<br>
<br>
to use an analogy, i would say that you can speed as much as you want off-road, but when driving in a town, you gotta respect the speed limits and stuff<br>
i love to speed personally, but only do it when there is noone around<br>
<br>
i was as happy for you as anyone on the server when you killed trak the first time or when you went to VP, as i was glad to see a friend of mine go on his first ubermob killing against VS 2 months ago, the difference is, noone will stop you from doing those things, but my friend would still be waiting for his first VS raid if his guild had to compete with SR, LoH, Watchers and others to kill a common ubermob <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uretiredjustise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RetiredJustise</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/29/01 6:36:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.justise.com/j.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: As the server ages...</span><hr size=1> Dynin your predictions are made on the basis that the dynamics of guilds would stay constant. You also base it on the fact that Larger guilds would bother with VS in a situation like that.<br>
<br>
Epics are gonna skew my argument a little but everything I say is essentialy true in my opinion.<br>
<br>
If LoH, SR, and watchers were doing PoM, ToV, VP and uber mobs all the time, I don't see them giving a hoot about Venril, or the other currently debated mobs. Trakanon possibly, because you can never really have to many donals bp's, but even he would soon be forgotten at the feet of Plane of Growth bp's and the quested ones. =)<br>
<br>
I'm really saddened at the pain we have caused ourselves. Yes, xyz person is able to lead there little guild on a successfull Venril raid, and we are all happy. But it seems tantammount to an ant carrying a over burdneed load back it its nest while being chased by a spider. In the big scheme of things who cares? Were not gonna make more money in rl, verants not gonna give us back manastones, and Temple of veeshan isn't gonna get any easier. In fact thousands of ants probably just died while you were reading this and you dont give a shit any more now then you would have not you thought about it. <br>
<br>
The thing of SR exploring and doing VP to death then moving on then telling others how to do it is on my list of fun things, right next to COMMIT SUICIDE. Do you guys really think thats fun? Nothing wrong with SR doing it to death, and nothing wrong with them sharing information, but my god do you guyys wana play a game? or do you want slow loading IRC? <br>

velious has been FCFS since it came out, and most of kunark still is, plus a part of the old world (what intentions really mean)<br>
<br>
and look at trakanon's rotation list :<br>
<br>
Trakanon Status: DOWN<br>
Date of Last Kill: 1/25/00 at 1159pm PST -- Clan Spiritslammer<br>

Silent Redemption (Tanix)<br>
Skyre Draneth (Elkanir)<br>
Enshadowed (Eddee)<br>
Danni (INDY) <br>
Clan Spiritslammer (Kruunch)<br>
<br>
now i will not post the VS list because it's too long, but you can find on the list :Skyre Draneth,Enshadowed,Abyss,Elysian,Silent Redemption,Watchers,Legion of Heroes,Clan Spiritslammer<br>
<br>
how many people from these guilds have you heard complaining about VS and trak being too crowded ? tons<br>
<br>
they do want to raid them and just with these guilds it's still going to be a looong while before they get everything they need<br>
<br>
this said, i dont even see the reason why they should have priority over anyone else<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
now to comment some of your other points..<br>
an indy or a guild having trouble raiding VS ?<br>
who honestly doubts that people like danni are going to have trouble for this pushover ?<br>
i could name maybe 10 indies and prolly as many guilds able to kill him without breaking a sweat<br>
<br>
but there are not many people able to raid velkator, the dain, the giant king, siren's grotto, mischief, chardok royalty, sky's higher islands...<br>
<br>
commonly raided things like VS, trak, the old planes, growth(more and more every day) can still be raided by the powerful guilds, but for those they will have to share with more than 2-3 other guilds, that's the only difference<br>
<br>
yes it sucks when a zone is already being raided when you know you could do it 10 times faster, dont think i dont know the feeling, but it's not a reason to say screw it i'm clearing the zone and they can kill our repops if they want<br>
<br>
unlike less powerful guilds, they have more choice of places to raid, so they dont deserve priority<br>
<br>
PS : sheesh i played dyn this week end to help with a raid and recieved 6 tells telling me i was just bitching because i couldnt join those guilds<br>
are you all really thinking that ? god, i was in enshadowed when i retired and i really have nothing against SR, LOH...<br>
how many fucking times will i have to say that ? <p><BR>

So, you're saying that we can get stomped all over and not be respected because we have the power to raid more?<br>
<br>
Not being respected means.. not posting when you kill a mob, not having enough knowledge to kill a mob but still being on the list.  Also I can think back to when someone left Nagafen there for over a week with a 25 spot rotation and he wasn't touched. <p><br><font face="Arial" size="-2">Vumil Darksoul<br>
