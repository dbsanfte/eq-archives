One problem though Tuda hon.  Mythic hasn't disabled Atl-tab nor do they plan to.  What they would ban for is if you used a program to stop DAoC's detection of an alt-tab (loss of focus) and prevented DAoC from shutting down, or using a hack so you can get back into the game.  Either way, this is not disabling MS OS, it is instead altering the way DAoC is run, which is against their EULA (see the section on 3rd party programs) <p><CENTER><a href=http://daocdivine.swgo.net/ ><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/SalDAoCSig.gif border=0 ></a><Center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 7:08:49 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Salicia says:  <b><i>Either way, this is not disabling MS OS, it is instead altering the way DAoC is run</b></i><br>

Not true.  The only way DAOC "knows" whether it is in the background or is running full screen is through the OS (and DirectX).  If I configure the OS to give it a different message, I'm not modifying the DAOC client at all.  It's no different than running an old game in Win2K under a compatibility layer, or in Linux under WINE, both being "legal" activities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 7:22:11 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/DivineEmblem.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Ok, point taken there, but by doing so you're still operating DAoC in a way different than how the developer wants the game run, and by doing so you can still be banned by mythic without much grounds for a suit.

<br>
So?  I didn't agree to "run the game in exactly the same way the developer wanted the game to run".  I agreed not to "modify the Game to change Game play" (EULA paragraph 8) and not to "reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile or otherwise reverse engineer" the code (paragraph 1).  Task-switching doesn't violate either provision.<br>

If you really wanna run windowed get Linux.  Install VMWare.  It allows you to run one OS in a window inside another OS.  Works very well. You can run windows inside the window, run DAoC from there.

<br>
Well, let's read the Rules of Conduct, at least the ones which are even tangentially relevant:<br>
<br>
"THOU SHALT NOT":<br>
<br>
<b>12. Abuse or exploit bugs, undocumented features, design errors or problems in the game collectively referred to as Problems.</b><br>
<br>
Doesn't apply.  This isn't a bug or undocumented feature, or a design error.<br>
<br>
<b>13. Use any scripting or macroing tools or software.</b><br>
<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
<b>14. Use any game hacking/altering/cheating software or tools.</b><br>
<br>
Nope, unless of course you consider Windows "hacking software", in which case everyone should be banned immediately.  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt><br>
 <br>
<b>15. Any disassembly or modification of any of the Game's executable code, databases and/or files. Nor may you interfere with or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running Dark Age of Camelot.</b><br>
<br>
The only interesting thing here is their poor grammar and syntax...<br>
 <br>
<b>16. Engage in any behavior that is contrary to the 'spirit of the game' as defined by Mythic in its sole discretion.</b><br>
<br>
Heh.  Is running in the foreground part of the "spirit of the game"?  I guess you could believe that, if you also believed Clinton didn't have sex in the White House.  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt><br>
<br>
On top of this, you could read the sentence you pointed out as forbidding activities that are generally "inappropriate".  That goes back to the argument in the pages above:  task switching is NOT an "inappropriate" feature of Windows -- it's an integral feature of Windows, and M$ won't be happy to have their core software labeled as "inappropriate".<br>
<br>
Based on their own language, I don't think Mythic has a leg to stand on on this issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 8:25:40 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/DivineEmblem.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> One thing you didn't mention Tuda is the "our sole discretion" part.<br>

Using a program to prevent DAoC in itself may not be illegal, but it may still be decided by Mythic that its against the "soul of the game" and that you will be banned by their sole discretion.<br>
<br>
BTW, they gave their "good" reasons for not wanting people to alt tab out.  a) running hack programs b) eating up bandwidth (and I know the whole AFK argument, so don't bother).  Either way, its their game, their bandwidth.  you pay to play.  You own the client software (which they're probably more than happy to let you keep) but you rent access to their servers.  If you betray the company by cheating the games original intent, don't expect to have access to their servers anymore, although you can run up the game as often as you want (You won't be able to log onto their servers anymore, but that's not <I>their</I> problem <img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons/tongue.gif>) <p><CENTER><a href=http://daocdivine.swgo.net/ ><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/SalDAoCSig.gif border=0 ></a><Center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A> at: 11/12/01 8:26:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 8:39:13 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Salicia says:  <b><i>One thing you didn't mention Tuda is the "our sole discretion" part.</b></i><br>
<br>
I (and others) did mention it -- several times.  If you read above, you'll see their discretion isn't absolute, namely they can't act in bad faith.  It would help to re-read this thread, dry as it may be.  :)<br>
<br>
<b><i>BTW, they gave their "good" reasons for not wanting people to alt tab out.</b></i><br>
<br>
No they don't.  The bandwidth and hacking arguments are silly, for reasons already stated.  I think the real reason is that their programmers didn't have the time (or competence) to program the game to run properly in the background and/or in a window, and they don't want to admit it.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Either way, its their game, their bandwidth. you pay to play.</b></i><br>
<br>
That's right, I pay to play.  And Mythic and I have an agreement as to what they will provide me in exchange for that money and what rules will govern our transaction.  If Mythic doesn't follow the rules, I have rights and forms of redress.<br>
<br>
<b><i>If you betray the company by cheating the games original intent, don't expect to have access to their servers anymore</b></i><br>

I <b>DO</b> expect to have access to their servers, so long as I follow the rules of our agreement, because that's what I bought.<br>

<br>
What courts say is that this merely identifies the party that can exercise its discretion, but that it still must act reasonably and in good faith.  "Sole discretion" does not mean that a party can act in bad faith.<br>
<br>
Warning, legal quotation ahead (but I'll keep this one short):<br>
<br>
<i>The  phrase "in her  sole discretion"  does not waive the good  faith  requirement placed upon acts of discretion, but merely limits who makes the decision.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
So, what sort of language is required to waive the good faith requirement, if you can?  This may be limited in some jurisdictions by statute based on the nature of the contract, but in general:<br>
<br>
<i><=52>  The good faith requirement may be waived by the words of the trust but the words are interpreted narrowly. Words found to waive the reasonableness standard are "absolute" or "unlimited" or "uncontrolled" discretion. To the contrary, the words "in  sole  discretion"  do not waive[**11] the good  faith  requirement. </i><br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, this means that Mystic does have great latitude in making decisions about customer accounts.  But it is not unbounded, especially when it has promulgated certain standards of accepted behavior. <br>

Actually, you could alt tab out and back in just fine during beta - the change came in on the second to last beta patch.  As for arguing over this, its all pointless in the end.  Mythic has taken a different view to hackers and bannings that VI has right from the start, so I doubt this won't be too much of a problem. <p><CENTER><a href=http://daocdivine.swgo.net/ ><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/SalDAoCSig.gif border=0 ></a><Center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueqaquinas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQAquinas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 11:51:15 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> <b>So roleplaying, which by definition is impersonating someone else, is illegal (in a roleplaying game), and you can't defend it by saying you are roleplaying? </b><br>

I think they probably mean impersonate in the sense of pretending to be some other existing person, such as a Mythic representative or another player.  In fact, the first sentence of the rule reads in its entirety, "[Player may not...] Impersonate any person, including, but not limited to, Mythic' employees, CSRs or hosts."<br>

The "roleplaying is not an excuse" rule, of course, just anticipates a lame but commonly-used excuse for antisocial behavior ("But I'm roleplaying a sexual deviant who likes to swear a lot!"). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umappill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mappill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 9:13:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> I read only the first few responses, so this may be a duplicate thought.  I would like to have the ability to alt-tab for the sole purpose of being able to go find a map (maybe even print) or other useful info that might help me from having to log out and back in which takes some time.  As long as we are still vulernable, what difference does it make if we are not actively playing it.  It should act just like being AFK, just with the ability to do something else on the comp.  <br>
<br>
Heck, you could even have it up at work and alt-tab out when needed.   <br>
<br>
Just my 2cp<br>

It's ______ company's game they can and will ban you for whatever reason they want to ban you.<br>
<br>
This is the debate that has gone on since the history of online gaming and most likely before.  If you do something that the game company doesn't want you to they can terminate your account end of story.  It's their sandbox if they don't wanna let you play they don't got to ;)<br>

<br>
And for those who are interested... start scavenging :)  Two of my three computers cost me a total of $100... the parts came from scavenging, begging, pleading, and I bought most of one of them from a friend online (it was missing several critical parts, but I had enough lying around to complete it).  Winamp will run perfectly fine on an older computer that most people would consider useless.  <p><hr><i>This statement is false.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 8:12:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Bobbins says:  <b><i>Tudamorf: I have several computers, but due to a lack of funds, space, and necessity I only have one monitor</b></i><br>
