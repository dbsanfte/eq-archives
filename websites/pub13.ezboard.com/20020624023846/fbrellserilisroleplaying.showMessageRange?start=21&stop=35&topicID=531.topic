<br>
<br>
Saffryn and Wardrym have spent several days freeing slaves together in Crushbone, and Saffryn has grudgingly begun to accept that Wardrym is true to his word and ideals about the Koada'Dal exploiting the Fier'Dal.  <br>
<br>
Finding her at her aunt and uncles business, Hearthwood Tavern, he sits at the table with her and sees she's eating a plate of Aviak eggs and Basilisk bacon.  Offering a strip of the bacon to him, she says, &quot;Want some?  Good for your teeth ya know, makes them hard as rocks.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, but I will have some of the gnomish java,&quot; he replies and signals to one of the Hearthwood helpers tending to tables.<br>
<br>
&quot;And that's a meal better for breakfast, not dinner,&quot; he adds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, well I was havin' a craving.  These are from Butcherblock and it's there that I travel this eve.  Guild is having a meeting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ward is served his java and watches the girl eat with a gusto.  &quot;Do you do anything half-way?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It ever get you in trouble?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yep&quot; she replies with a pirate smile as she wipes up the egg yoke with a piece of toast and stuffs it into her mouth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything important going on at the meeting?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't know, but if'n I did, I couldn't tell you ya know.  We may have become friends, but I've made a vow to these people.  I'll not speak of guild matters to those not inside.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can respect that.  Catch up with me later on our plans to get into that Tome?&quot; he asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;You betcha&quot; she replies as she stands, lays some coin on the table for the maid waiting the tables.  &quot;Enjoy your java, sir Prince,&quot; she smirks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enjoy your meeting,&quot; he replies with a secret smile.<br>
<br>
~~~~********~~~~<br>
<br>
Saffryn arrives at the meeting place and awaits the others to arrive, and one by one, they do.  It is decided where the new guild hall will be built.  There is talk of updating the membership roster. Minz awakens late, pantless, and gets lost on the way to the meeting.  Saffryn chuckles to herself, &quot;It's good to see some things are consistant.&quot;<br>
<br>
The floor is opened and there is one single, shocking announcement.  Windam and her husband, Derakarsis are leaving the Order of the Elder Dragons and joining the Violent Harvest.  At first there is shocked silence.  Then all hell breaks loose as Cressida tries to bring order back to the meeting.  Windam insists it's not her husband's idea, he being a Teir'Dal.  She insists it's all her idea.  <br>
<br>
Saffryn begins to mull over in her mind the consequences of this.  Is Windam going seriously, or is she on a secret spy mission?  What of Saffryn's quest for Windam's necklace?<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; she ponders to herself as the ruckus continues in the meeting, &quot;If Windam is leaving the Order for the enemy's side, then I have no reason to get her the necklace from Xareth….. which means there is no reason to exchange those spell pages that will stop that curse afflicting Xareth in exchange for the necklace.  Without those pages, no cure.  Without the cure,  the curse will continue to turn Xareth from a Teir'Dal into a Koad' Dal,  a 'Pale Lily', she chuckles.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Xareth,&quot; she says aloud to no one.  &quot;You're screwed.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
Saffryn is returning from the guild meeting in Butcherblock and decides to turn at the first left in the path instead of continuing towards the Spires.  Before her lies a different estate than the one she's seen last time she was here.  The wild berry bushes are cut back.  The trail is more defined.  What was once an overgrown tunnel of towering rhodedendrens is now trimmed back allowing sky to be seen above.  Turning the final bend she stops short to take in the changes.  A circle of willow trees outline several acres worth of land.  The largest willow sits on the bank of a lazy creek running the length of the property. In the middle of tended lawn and gardens sits a large house, three stories tall with large many-paned windows lined with heavy lead.  Half-way up the first story, the walls are made of rounded river-rock, the rest of the walls made up of heavy wood.<br>
<br>
She walks up the path, now made of the same river-rock, and reaches for the door-knocker.  It's designed of brass in the shape of two arms clasped over an old, gnarled willow tree.  <br>
<br>
Her knock is answered by a wood-elf maid who directs her into a large entry hall tiled in smooth stone.  Before her is a staircase against the left wall with a sweeping banister leading up to a gallery with doors at either end and more stairs seem to go up to the third floor at the right end of the gallery.  Doors behind the staircase on the first floor seem to be the kitchens if her sense of smell is correct, and she guesses that the door on the right leads to the dining room.  She is led through a door on the left before the stairs.<br>
<br>
The room is airy and comfortable looking, obviously a parlor to greet guests in.  She has little time to look around before Wardrym bounds into the room, &quot;Saffy, come on upstairs,&quot;  and he turns and jumps up the stairs taking two at a time.<br>
<br>
With a crooked smile, Saffryn follows him up the stairs and past the open door on the left of the gallery, which at quick glance looks to be the family's living area, and follows him as he dissapears into the far door-way.  Just as she reaches the doorway she peeks up to her right at the stairway to the third-floor, guessing there are sleeping chambers up there, and continues through the door and enters a well-shelved library.  Wardrym has dissappeared.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly Wardrym pops his head through a small door partially hidden by a large house plant, &quot;Coming?&quot; he says, and she stiffles another smile while passing a large, comfortable couch and chairs arranged around a large lit hearth, the smell of leather and books lending to a cozy atmosphere. Passing through the last door she sees a den with a large desk near a window, and a large, long table against a wall lined with bookshelves and more books.  The long table is in disaray for the most part, and she finds Wardrym standing in front of a large parchment rolled out on the left side of the table.  Joining him, she sees a map to a tower in Felwithe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I see, you've been working on our quest,&quot; she says to Wardrym.  &quot;And before we get started on that, I have to say, you've done wonders with this old hunting lodge.  Took out all the fancy, gaudy stuff, I see too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it was too stiff and fancy for comfort, and when were you here before?&quot; asks Ward, curiously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, for the longest time, breaking into this old haunt was the dare of all dares for young ones before entering into our guilds.  That is, after properly scaring the one dared with bonfires and stories of the beheaded ghouls meandering the halls, of course,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course,&quot; Wardrym says with a grin.  &quot;Now, back to the quest.  I have the routine of the guards, memorized the way to the tower,&quot; he begins as Saffryn begins studying the map.<br>
<br>
She traces two routes to the tower, &quot;you've alternative routes, good, good.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thought you'd appreciate that, you being a ranger,&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh aye, many a man is lost due to a closed path.  Always have a second,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
She traces a staircase on the map with her finger as they begin to discuss their plans for their impending quest and asks, &quot;When do we do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym looks her in the eye with all seriousness, &quot;Tomorrow night&quot;<br>
<br>

<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Shaede leaves a message to Saffyrn in the OED public hall. She slips in quietly and leaves just as quiet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saffryn. I have not heard from you in some time. If you feel this is some kind of game or that you can simply ignore this in the hopes it goes away. I would like to take this moment to remind you, maybe inform you for the first time knowing Minz, that one of your own is at risk with this. If you wish Silverstarr to suffer a similar fate to Xareth then please, continue on your current course of action you will lose one of your own. Remember my promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Saffryn reads the note and wonders who Silverstarr is. <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Minz's reply:<br>
<br>
/ooc<br>
<br>
Ohhh Saffy! You're WICKED!<br>
/ic<br>
<br>
&quot;I imagine Silver is either already turned true blue or dead. Either way. I must concur with my dear ranger.&quot; <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 /turns and passes the note to Minz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then I shall not worry about it, Minz, besides, I'm onto another quest at the moment, the details of which I am honor-bound to keep quiet till it is over. <br>
<br>
&quot;What should I do with this note?&quot; Minz asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Burn it,&quot; Saffy replies with a shrug. &quot;Perhaps they will get desperate and make me a more profitable offer,&quot; she adds with a pirate smile and leaves the guild-hall to meet Wardrym at Willowswood.  <br>

They meet halfway at the top of the stairs as Saffryn quips, &quot;you look like a regular Koada'Dal,&quot; looking him up and down.<br>
<br>
Wardrym shifts his princely robes, &quot;I forgot how impractical and uncomfortable they were. Heavy too.&quot; <br>
<br>
A wry smile alits on his face as they begin descending the stairs, thinking to himself how HE should be dressed the servant knowing that it is Saffryn who is the true heir to Nobleheart and that she is unknowingly the very Koada'Dal she picks upon so often. <br>
<br>
Knowing they have time, they walk the path from Willowswood to the crossroads where they can choose to go right to Butcherbloock or left towards the Spires. They continue on to the Spires that is bustling with traffic to and from the Nexus. As they pass the turn to Lesser Faydark, they continue with small talk. Wardrym has cleaned up the orchards of Willowswood and should have a good stock of fruit for Kelethin next year. Saffryn has just achieved her 14th Season and is looking forward to new spells upon reaching her 15th. <br>
<br>
Their talk lessens as tension starts building as they reach the rolling hills just before Felwithe. Soon the towering Castle stands before them. Wardrym approaches the entrance with a nod at the guards, Saffryn following in his footsteps, looking respectfully down while hiding a snear.<br>
<br>
Wardrym makes small talk with some of the merchants, avoiding the bard in front of the tavern lest he recognise Saffy. In a private patch of grass around one of the shops, Ward hands Saffryn a bottle of invisible potion and he downs his, waving his arms to initiate the effect. Saffryn can't help but be reminded of his arm-swinging when he was following her around in Freeport, and her nick-name for him then, &quot;Mr. Bramblepants.&quot;<br>
<br>
They approach the lake, but rather than taking the left path towards the fish shops and traveling on to the Caster's Conclave of Towers, Ward directs her to the wall on the right and finds the tile that is encoded. They silently wait for the guards who patrol the area to move on. He whispers to Saffryn to place her palm upon the tile which is at first cold to her touch, but then warms. Thinking the caster's enchanted tile has read her Trueshot blood, she hears a click and sees the panel of tile wall open a crack. She quickly slips in with Wardrym close behind her. <br>
<br>
The staircase before them is a tight curl, barely wide enough for them both as they climb the dusty marble steps. First Saffryn begins to appear when the effects of the potion fade, followed by Wardrym, though it matters not at this point, as long as they avoid the few windows that dot the tall thin tower. Another tall, thin window before them, they lay their backs against the curving wall opposing the window and slide across it so as to not lay shadow before the glass letting in what little light that plays with the dust motes.<br>
<br>
The tower is the tallest of Felwithe and oversees all of Greater Faydark, what of it you can see between towering tree tops of evergreens that have stood for centuries. After a long, long climb, they reach the top and sigh with relief. They have avoided each trap set in the marble steps. If all goes well, the next traps are but tests for the inquiring elf to ensure they are of the true blood and allowed to view the the Holy Tome, the Book of Law. <br>
<br>
Looking about, this room at the top of their world is a room made up of a small circle, lit brightly with full-length windows. Between each window stands a globe to light the room even in full darkness. &quot;Ah,&quot; says Saffryn, &quot;you've brought us to the Tower of the Eternal Light. An appropriate place for the Holy book written by Tunare, herself.&quot; She tries to speak with a touch of irony but is too awed by her circumstances to carry it off well. <br>
<br>
In the middle of the room on an ornate platinum pedestal is a platinum box set with emeralds. There is a star engraved upon the box. They both circle the box and see a decorated opening the size of a fist on the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now what?&quot; asks Saffryn<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you put your hand in it,&quot; he replies.<br>
<br>
&quot;You think? What do you mean, you think? YOU put your hand in there,&quot; she exclaims.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, I'm not a Trueshot&quot; he answers.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, but you're the heir to Nobleheart, one of the Star Council,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, but there's a trick to it if you are one of the five, something you have to do with your hand while it's in the box. A Trueshot doesn't have to do anything but stick their hand in the box,&quot; he lies. <br>
<br>
Frowning at him, she rolls up her sleeve, narrows her eyes, and slowly begins to put her hand in the box.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, right or left hand,&quot; she asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; he replies.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean you don't know,&quot; she retorts.<br>
<br>
&quot;Um, that's part of the &quot;tricks&quot; you learn when you're an heir to the Star Council. Remember, my father hasn't shared any of those secrets with me.&quot; He says.<br>
<br>
&quot;But you THINK it won't matter because my great-great-great-great auntie was the wizard that set this thing up,&quot; she says with a raised brow.<br>
<br>
Wardrym can think of no reply but to look innocent and shrug.<br>
<br>
Saffryn scowls at him and tries not to think he looks cute when he's playing stupid.<br>
<br>
With a sigh and resolve, she puts her right fist into the box. Nothing happens. They both look at each other. She opens her fist in the box. Nothing happens. She wiggles her fingers. Nothing happens. She reaches fully into the box, extending her hand to find a depression on the far side with her middle finger. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a device that had been laying flat on the upper inside of the box slaps down encompassing her hand painfully like a vice. From the bottom of the box, a device drives a needle up into her wrist and extracts a small vial's worth of blood from her veins. The emeralds on the outside of the box glow and Saffryn discovers it is more comfortable to not resist as the clamp grows tighter when she struggles. <br>
<br>
Both of them hold their breath as they wait for the box to do something next. Seconds seem like minutes. Cracks on the floor under the dust light up and the cracks take shape and appear to be a five pointed star. And then suddenly, all the lights go out. <br>
<br>
The emeralds on the box go back to sleep. The lit cracks in the floor fade into the dust. The device in the box release Saffryn's hand. She pulls her hand from the box, examining it for damage and finds only a tinyl hole in her wrist. A click in the room against a wall makes them both turn their heads in the direction of the sound. A crack in the ceiling against the far wall opens slightly, then slowly widens further as a small portion of the ceiling descends, supporting a small staircase to the floor of the room they are standing in. <br>
<br>
With a grin, Wardrym realizes the jeweled box has decided that Saffryn is, indeed, the heir to the Star Council seat held now by Joren Nobleheart. Another thought, &quot;if Saffryn realised the truth, instead of thinking the box accepted her for that phoney story I trumped up about the Trueshot ancestor wizardress, she'd spit nails it me, great big ogre nails at that,&quot; he chuckles aloud at the thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh you think this is funny, do you, I almost wet me pants!&quot; she admonishes Ward as she stalks off to the staircase.<br>
<br>
Carefully leading up the stairs and watching for more traps and finding none, she stands before a door with a smaller door inset within it at face height. &quot;Now what do I do?&quot; she asks as she turns to Wardrym who has followed her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You open the little door and put your face close to it,&quot; he answers.<br>
<br>
&quot;What, so a claw can jump out and gouge out me eyes?&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, I know exactly what this one does. Everyone one with the blood of the Council, er in your case the blood of the Trueshot,&quot; he lies, &quot;has a strange pattern to the blood vessels in the back of their eyes, a little corner where the veins make the shape of a star. &quot; he adds.<br>
<br>
&quot;You sure?&quot; she asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Positive, go ahead,&quot; he says, trying not to admire the butt in front of his face as she is several steps above him on the small staircase.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, here goes,&quot; she replies and opens the small door. A beam of blue light examines her right eye and goes out as the door clicks open. With a shrug and a deep breath she pushes the door open.<br>
<br>
<br>

Above her, the roof if tiled with leafs of crystal. The receding daylight refracts into myriads of colors through the clear ceiling and is reflected on the walls that are made of mirrors of pounded and polished mithral. She steps off the staircase and completely enters the room with Wardrym behind her. The door they entered in closes to complete the circle of mirrors that make the walls of the round room. They can hear the mechanism that is retracting the staircase below back into it's resting place.<br>
<br>
Upon the floor she finds no dust but a pristine floor of ivy-green marble, tiled with a huge pearly star of abalone. In the center of this star sits a pedestal made of an ancient full-size trunk from a ancient gnarled tree. Upon it's base on a mithral stand lies a large book covered in gold under a crystal dome.<br>
<br>
Saffryn looks to Wardrym for reassurance, and he nods her ahead with, &quot;only you can approach the book, I must stay on the green marble. I cannot step upon the star.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding her understanding she slowly approaches the domed book. As her breath touches the crystal, it rises on it's own. Saffryn's eyes widen, then narrow as she opens her palms in the open space between the dome and the book to sense for traps. She knows she has not the skills of a rogue, but her ranger skills are sharp and she feels no apprehension. <br>
<br>
She places her right hand upon the golden cover with a look of awe, noting the star engraved upon it, a Willow tree within the star. The surprise of that makes her voice catch in the start of a giggle and wonders if she is getting too nervous. &quot;Look, Ward, a willow tree on the cover of it, of all things. It looks like that ancient tree at the creek on your estate!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ward smiles sideways as he edges as close as he dare and still remain on the green parts of the floor, &quot;Coincidence, I'd guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
She turns the cover to the first page and sighs with disappointment, &quot;It's in ancient elvish, I cannot read it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can, you step to the side and turn the pages. The writing is large enough, I should be able to make it out from here.&quot; He says as she steps to the lower left leg of the star while he remains on the point of the green between the star's legs. &quot;'The Lawful Book of Tunare', is what the large words say. The smaller words say 'A Gift of Wisdom to Her People'.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The paper is like a parchement I've never felt before. I can't believe I'm touching this book with my bare hands,&quot; says Saffryn as she turns the page.<br>
<br>
&quot;A drought has come upon Tunaria&quot;, Ward begins, &quot;at the hands of Solusek Ro just as a drought from Hope and all that is Good assails all the races upon this land. As the trees die of our mighty forest, so do My people's hearts wither and dry like empty husks. My Eldritch are a Good and Noble race, and must be preserverd. I shall take them out of Takish Hur unto a New World across the Ocean of Tears.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My people shall leave behind their ties and and politics and divide themselves into but two Houses, Feir'Dal and Koada'Dal, meaning Forest Dwell and Stone Dwell. Those with the skills of the woodsmen, the hunters, the magic of nature, shall gather together into the Family of Feir'Dal. Those who excel in enchantments and wizardries will aid the Feir'Dal with magical fortifications while they protect themselves in the New World with fortifications of stone. Within their walls, they shall also protect those with Holy visions, the clerics and my Holy Warriors, the Paladins. Together, these two Houses shall have warriors to encircle and protect the families as a whole.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So that no House shall have unfair power over the other, A Star Council shall be formed as a parliament to their King or Queen. This Council shall have Five Arms, no arm having more power than another. The person representing each Arm shall have the title of Duke or Duchess. These five arms shall be comprised of the following.<br>
1. The High-Tower: This seat shall represent the interests of the Enchanters, Mages, and Wizards. Within that conclave, they may divide themselves into Marquis and Marquises, one for each discipline of magic, all answering to the Duke or Duchess of the Tower of Magic. Of the Elements, they shall represent Air, intelligence, and the Mind of Tunare.<br>
2. The Papacy. This seat shall represent the interests of the Holy, the Clerics, my Paladins, and the Druids. Each of them may also have a Marquie or Marquissa. Of the Elements, they shall represent water, wisdom, and the Heart of Tunare.<br>
3. The Mithrals. This seat shall represent the Merchant Barons, the Elements of Earth and the Prosperity of Tunare. They may have as many or as few Marquis and Marquesses as they wish to stir up their pots, but the economy of the people shall have but one Duke or Duchess and therefore only one Mithral Vote to stay the inclination of Greed.<br>
<br>
4. The Guardians: This seat shall represent the interests of those who physically protect the Eldritch. They are the Warriors, Scouts, and Rangers and each may be represented by a Marquie or Marquiessa. This seat represents the Elements of Fire, War, The Protection of Tunare.<br>
<br>
<br>
These Four Arms shall make up the Parliament of Tunare, to aid the King or Queen in the spiritual, emotional, physical, and economic health of My People. If and when a time comes that they, My Parliament shall find a matter in which they deadlock in opinion and vote, they shall call upon the Fifth and Final Arm of the Star Council. The Peacekeeper, or Lodan.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of all the Trees of My Forest, it is the Willow that bends the farthest and does not break. The greatest quakes may shake it. The strongest winds may blow. The Willow ever bends with the times and remains firm in Her Soil and Strong in Her Heart. So shall be the Arm of the Lodan, the Peacekeeper. It will be their vote that decides a deadlock.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saffryn turns the final page to find the back cover of the book. &quot;That's it? What about the Princes and the Barons, who decides who gives what to who and all that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Wardrym swallows with a dry mouth from all that reading and rubs his eyes, stepping farther back into the green area of the floor to ensure his safety. &quot;It's as I thought. The book has been added too and manipulated to read as the Koada'Dal dared while the Fier'Dal were busy protecting everyone's butts.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder where the Bards fit it,&quot; wonders Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; says Wardrym.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, Bards. Musicians that sing, heal, fight in battles, they do a little bit of everything. Tunare said nothing about where they fit in.&quot; says Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I guess then the Bards have the freedom to decided for themselves. You sure have a knack for thinking of the strangest things at the darndest times.&quot; Says Wardrym<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks to me like the Koada'Dal decided a lot for themselves and everyone else,&quot; she says, side-stepping Ward's verbal poke. &quot;What are we going to do about it?&quot; asks Saffryn.<br>
<br>
<br>

A storm begins and Ward stops Saffryn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, let's wait here a bit till the storm passes,&quot; he says as he sits on an exposed root of a large willow, sheltered under the umbrella of its branches.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure, Ward. Nothing like sitting next to a large tree when there's lightening,&quot; she replies sarcastically and plops down beside him. &quot;Now, maybe we can have that talk. What are we going to do about what we found out?&quot; She pulls the hair out of her mouth that has whipped there by the rising wind as the storm continues.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've thought myself in circles about this. If we go to the Barons, they'll demand to see the original Tome and by the time they get to see it, another false one will be created to take it's place. If we go to the Princes, it will be hushed up and we'll suddenly disappear,&quot; he says loudly to be heard over the claps of thunder.<br>
<br>
Another round of thunder as the lightening casts strange images against the branches and on the nearby creek. The waters begin to churn, wild and muddy with a strong current as the skies blacken and hide the approaching dawn.<br>
<br>
&quot;What if we tell them that if anything happens to us, then what we know has been written down and will be revealed,&quot; she asks as she is whipped in the face with willow branches in the rising wind and stands to untangle herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thought of that, and that puts our families in danger. I think we need to find a way to get the Barons and the Princes all in one room and tell them what we know all at once, but first, there's one more secret I have to tell you,&quot; he says as he stands with a worried look, seemingly oblivious to the raging storm.<br>
<br>
Walking closer to the side of the creek and ignoring the torrent of rain as wood-elves are known to do, he turns with an unheard sigh, &quot;Saffryn, there's something you have to know, something I haven't told you. I haven't exactly lied to you, I just didn't have the right time to reveal this,&quot; he nearly has to shout.<br>
<br>
Looking suspiciously at him she turns with her hands on her hips and shouts back, &quot;Go on.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looks to the mud at his feet, and then up to her eyes, &quot;Saffryn, you aren't really a Trueshot, and I'm not really the heir of Nobleheart. In fact, YOU are the heir of Prince Joren,&quot; he shouts.<br>
<br>
First she cracks a smile, and then throwing her head back, she laughs, letting the rain fall full on her now drenched face. &quot;Oh Ward, you had me going there, you goof. Now really, how are we going to get the Barons and Princes together.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not joking Saff, it's true. You were delivered by a mid-wife named Miaza the same night I was delivered. She switched us. She gave you to the Trueshot family and gave me to the woman I have called mother all these years. Ask your mother who the mid-wife was,&quot; he says.<br>
<br>
&quot;And why would she do such a thing, why would anyone do such a thing,&quot; she asks as she squints at him through the rain, trying to figure what he's up to.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a history of stillbirths and infant deaths before me. Prince Joren had tried for years to gain an heir through several wives. Miaza feared for my, your mother's death if she did not produce a healthy heir. They were all born sickly girls. The woman who raised you had a history of healthy boys. They were both due to deliver close to each other. When Niola Impholder-Nobleheart began her labor pains, the midwife started your, my mother's labor with the slipping of belladonna into her tea. They delivered the same night. She switched us before showing us to our mothers,&quot; he explains. <br>
<br>
Turning with Saffryn as she circles him in the mud while he continues explaining to her, &quot;She was sure you'd be another sickly girl like all the girls before you and since the Trueshot already had plenty of kids that one loss would be easier on them than on Lady Niola and took the healthy boy baby, me, to the Noblehearts. You were born here, at Willowswood, at the hunting lodge. She hid you and took you to the Trueshot's home and switched us when I was born and handed you to the Baroness Trueshot. Saffryn, you are the heir to Nobleheart. Think about it. It's how we were able to get into the chambers of the Book Of Laws.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You said it was because my ancestress set the traps, that she was a wizardress,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
&quot;I lied.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do I know you aren't lying now? How do I know what is a lie and what is a truth with you,&quot; she angrily shouts at him, her fists doubled up at her sides.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's true Saffy, ask your mother who the midwife was, ask her about the storm the night you were born. It hid your cries as we were switched at birth. The device that read the blood vessels in your eye saw the star there and let you in the Tome's chamber. The box in the chamber before that read your blood to find it true. You are the high-elven heir of Nobleheart&quot; He says.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't believe you,&quot; she shouts at him as she swings her fist around and clobbers him on his left eye. Suddenly off-balance, Ward begins to slip into the mud as she slams her left fist under his jaw. Instead of falling to his right, his weight is suddenly shifted backwards and he falls solidly in the mud, his boots catching Saffryn's ankles on the way down and flipping her suddenly on her butt.<br>
<br>
Quickly he turns over to his hands and knees and shoots his arm out to Saffryn and grabs her by the arm. She tries to kick him and he rolls over, taking her with him deeper into the mud. Sitting on top of him she twists one of her arms free and slams a muddy fist into his chest, flinging mud into her eyes and into his mouth as he stammers to calm her down. He begins to choke as he swallows more mud and starts to chuckle as he wrestles with the muddy hell-cat. Gaining an upright position he succeeds in flipping her onto his lap and slaps his muddy hand across her butt with a sound splatt, flinging more mud everywhere and chuckling louder at succeeding at getting a loud squeel out of her. <br>
<br>
As she swings wildly and kicks, trying to buck out of his lap, he tightens his grasp on her and spanks her again. Getting a mouthfull of mud, she clamps her mouth down on his thigh and bites him hard. With a jump, he flings her off him to the edge of the muddy hole and she continues to roll down the side of the bank and splashes into the creek. He jumps up to follow her to see if she is alright, rubbing a hand on his thigh and sees her sitting up in the shallow creek. Not even noticing that the storm had subsided, the clouds have broken, and a beam of sunlight shines brightly down upon Saffryn's muddy head. <br>
<br>
Laughing heartily as he approaches the creek to give her a hand, he extends it to help her out, which of course, she takes and pulls him into the creek with her. They begin to splash and toss water at each other, eventually washing away all the mud until they are tired of the game and her anger has subsided. <br>
<br>
Gathering their things sitting cleanly against the gnarled old willow tree, they continue on to the lodge, Willowswood.<br>
<br>
&quot;I still don't believe you, ya know,&quot; she says as they enter the foyer of Willowswood. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to, I suppose,&quot; he answers as he sees the look of dismay on Daina's face as she approaches, seeing the mess they are making on the floor.<br>
<br>
The housekeeper takes over, clucking and admonishing them like a couple of children and sends them upstairs to change into robes. <br>
<br>
They meet again, dryer and warmer and begin sipping brandy beside the fire in easy chairs, a small table between them, thinking quietly to themselves as they both fall asleep.<br>

I may go back at a later date and insert just HOW I got everyone in one place, but for now, lets just skip a few chapters and assume we got them all here and finish up this story so I can get on with butting my pointy nose into other people's stories. <br>
<br>
And now, the finale of Willowswood:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crickets chirped under well-lit windows but were unheard by the Princes debating within the Hall. Five Princes of the Star Council and their Heirs stood alongside other Royals within the sidelines of the Court as unfamiliar faces weaved through the crowd as the King held the Court of the Full Moon. It was upon these sessions that subjects were allowed to bring cases before the King without going through the channels and red-tape of the lesser Royals. An argument had ensued over the astronomical taxation put upon the Feir'Dal Barons by the Koada'Dal Princes. Many Barons who normally would not attend this Court could be seen alongside faces of their Feir'Dal friends and workers who had never been this deep into Castle Felwithe.<br>
<br>
One Baron and One Prince stood toe to toe in heated debate upon the blue carpet engraved with fleur-de-lis that divided the King's hall down the middle from entry to throne. The King sat leaning upon one elbow, a finger to his brow. His wife sitting patiently beside him. He briefly thought back to the same arguments made in private council with his economists. They warned him that the Princes were out of control, driven with special influence of the Star Council. The Book of Tunare gave them special rights and guaranteed those rights as a &quot;parliament&quot; but they acted more as men who would tie the King's hands for their own gain and block the King at every move to right things between the Two Houses of the Eldritch. <br>
<br>
A single figure moved from the crowd, a woman. Feir'dal? Koada'Dal? She stood a height in-between and moved in a gown of green spiderling satin. Her warm-honey colored hair rippled in loose curls over bare shoulders. The boldness at her interuption stopped the argument and silenced the crowd as she approached the steps to the King's throne, daring to step up upon the first one uninvited.<br>
<br>
Cocking her head to the side, she asked quietly, &quot;My King, have you seen the Book of Tunare, with your own eyes? Do you judge the world on heresay, or do you know the truth with your own mind?&quot;<br>
<br>
Taken aback and thinking the girl a bit daft, he opened his mouth a bit and closed it as his wife and Queen put a soft hand upon her husband's own. &quot;I have sat quiet until this point, listening to arguments shifting like houses built upon sand,&quot; looking to the girl she continues, &quot;and what this young woman asks is a valid point. Should not an argument be made upon a more solid foundation?&quot;<br>
<br>
The arguing Prince interrupts, &quot;My Queen, the Book may be looked upon by only the Star Council,&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, my Queen, for I have seen the book,&quot; the girl interrupts. Giving the Prince a look of death she continues, &quot;and do not say I have seen but a copy, for I have seen the original and bear the mark upon my wrist from where I was tested.&quot; She holds up her hand and her billowy sleeve falls back from her wrist to reveal a small mark. Turning to the King and Queen, she continues, &quot;The Princes of the Star Council know what made this mark, what device tested my blood, and I can tell you of this book, my Queen and King. I offer you my services, to take you to this Book that you may read it's truth with your own eyes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bewilderment and confusion spreads among the court and Prince Joren steps from the crowd to join the arguers before the throne, &quot;Nay my King and Queen, this is a trick to take your very life. There are traps to the Book to ward off those who would destroy the book. They are set to take the life of any who is not of the Council. She would use these traps to harm you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you childe,&quot; the King asks, looking at the girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Saffryn, born of Niola Impholder-Nobleheart and raised by the family of Trueheart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Lies!&quot; hisses Prince Joren.<br>
<br>
&quot;Truth,&quot; says Wardrym as he steps from the crowd and joins Saffryn. &quot;This woman was born at Willowswood the night I was born in Kelethin to the family of Trueshot. The midwife, Miaza, switched us at birth to protect Niola Impholder from the wrath of Prince Joren should another of his heirs die in infancy. We stand before you, your Majesties, willing to be tested by clerics and proven that our stories are truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Together, Saffryn and I have worked to find the truth, in hopes to heal the widening between the Two Houses of Eldritch, the Feir'dal and Koada'Dal. We have seen the original Book that lies entombed in the Hidden-Tower, with traps to keep the truth hidden. Listen to us, please.&quot; Wardrym finishes.<br>
<br>
&quot;There is more, Majesties,&quot; Saffryn joins in. &quot;You need know that the five families that &quot;protect&quot; this book, the ones the wizard-locks answer to, are NOT the Star Council that was intended by Tunare. The locks were set to answer to those who would guard the book, long ago, and the task was handed down from heir to heir, but these are not the heirs to Tunare's Council. While the original intention may have been good, that five families protect the book, the ideal has been corrupted so long ago that no one remembers. The five that hold the book now, hold it in hostage, controlling everyone in the kingdom, even tying your own hands oft times, begging your pardon, my King. The Book of Tunare was wizard locked to answer to five families, but not to the true Star Council. Tunare meant the Eldritch to be led by both houses, Koada'Dal and Feir'Dal alike,&quot; Saffryn finishes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I should like to see this Book, the true and original Book of Tunare. We shall it it on the morrow. &quot; The King declares as he waves to his Chamberlain. Quickly all in attendance are vacated from the hall save for Saffryn, Wardrym, and the five Princes of the Star Council, sans their heirs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear to you, your majesty, this girl cannot be my daughter, this is all lies,&quot; he declares with a look of distain for Saffryn. &quot;Your life is at stake if you try to enter that chamber. The wizard lock is unforgiving and will only answer to the Star Council and our heirs. You must not go, your Highness. This is a trick to take your life.&quot; Joren pleads.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you shall lead us in, Joren. If I die, you will be held responsible.&quot; the King responds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wha…&quot; Joren begins to exclaim,<br>
<br>
&quot;You profess to know so much of the Book, you can prove yourself by disabling the locks yourself and I shall follow. If I die, you die. The Queen shall rule in my place,&quot; declares the King with a raised brow from his wife. &quot;Guards, take the council to their Hall to await the dawn. As for these two,&quot; he motions to Wardrym and Saffryn, &quot;Take them into seclusion and guard them well.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
OOC: again, to save time, I will omit the chapter depicting the King's trek up into the Hidden-Tower of Felwithe castle and his displeasure at the trickery of what was until now, known as the Star Council. I will submit this chapter later when winter returns and I have more time for writing.<br>
<br>
CONTINUED:<br>
<br>
Epilogue:<br>
<br>
It is late in the afternoon and the King has left the Hidden-Tower for the second time, this time with the Queen and his most faithful Wizard in tow. The locks have been changed so that they will only answer to the King and Queen and their Heirs.<br>
<br>
The King and Queen have issued a proclamation that has gone forth through-out the Faydarks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hear Ye, Hear Ye, let it me known through-out the Land.<br>
Elections will be held for offices of the Star Council.<br>
The winners, chosen by all the peoples of the Eldritch shall<br>
Bear the title of Duke or Duchess.<br>
<br>
The elections shall be held as follows:<br>
<br>
All Casters shall gather together and vote into offices of Marquis and Marquisses those they wish to lead in the guilds of Enchanters, Wizards, and Mages; and a Duke or Duchess of High Tower to represent them all in the Royal Court.<br>
<br>
All of the Priest classes shall gather together and vote into offices the Marquis and Marquisses to lead the guilds of Clerics, Druids, and their protectors, the Paladins; and a Duke or Duchess of the Papacy to represent them all in Royal Court.<br>
<br>
All of the trade and land Barons shall gather together and vote into offices three Marquis and/or Marquisses to lead them; and a Duke or Duchess of the Mithrals to represent them all in Royal Court.<br>
<br>
All of those who protect the realm shall gather together and vote into offices the Marquis and Marquisses to lead the guilds of Warrior Fier'Dal, Warrior Koada'Dal, Rangers, and Scouts; and a Duke or Duchess of the Guardians to represent them all in Court.<br>
<br>
These four Dukes and Duchesses shall serve as the Star Council representing the people as a parliament before the King and Queen in Royal Court. A fifth member of the Star Council, the Peacekeeper, has been chosen by the King and Queen and will serve to keep peace among the council and vote as tie-breakers should the need arise. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
At present count, Ascrida Ramaloke of the Order of the Elder Dragons leads in the race for Marquisse Enchantress, as does Garchoo of the Fellows of Valor leads in the race for Marquis Wizard. Cresida Peregryn leads for the Clerics, Aegaras Ashenblade ties with Rhoenil Brindleheart for the Druids, and Hawkeblade Steelheart, also of the Fellowship of Valor runs for the Paladins. The Marquis and Marquisse of the Mithrals are still being argued, but it appears the Duke of Mithrals may very well be given to Arbyr Naurgalad of Solus. Among the Guardians, both wood-elf and high-elf warrior guilds still argue, but Legadas Eryndil is well thought of for Rangers and Minz Elandil leading in the votes for Scouts. <br>
<br>
And the Peacekeepers? Saffryn refuses to take the name of her blood father, Nobleheart and has taken the name of her new husband, Wardrym, who, himself, dropped the Nobleheart name for the name of his estate, Willowswood. And while they may still argue and throw a bit of mud hear and there, like a willow, they shall bend to one another and their union shall ever be strong. <br>
<br>
The End…of their low level seasons anyway. The mid-level seasons are yet to come.<br>

<br>
Saffryn, I hope that my hawke has reached you.  I have sufficient information from reliable sources to conclude that The Lord of the Felwithe Paladins has been corrupt!  Madam, I know you thought all was well, but let that NEVER fool you.  This is no doubt the work of The Prince of Hate.  M'lady,  we must speak, I have arranged a meeting between Lord Trueshot of the Ranger's Guild, you, and myself.  Send a letter back with my hawke, he will know where to find me...Madam, this is no matter of Orcs or Dervishes...This is a matter of Gods at their work and mere mortals defying them.  Be safe.<br>
<br>
Your Comrade,<br>

I saw that you ended your post...I'd like to take this a little farther since I chose to enter this thread a little late.  We should set up a player-run quest to &quot;de-corrupt&quot; the Paladin guy (forgot his name).  E-mail me at ZantesDarkwood@hotmail.com or IM me at LiveIt182, OR shoot me a tell on Zantes.<br>
