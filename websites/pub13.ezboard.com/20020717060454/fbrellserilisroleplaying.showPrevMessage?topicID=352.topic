They will be told for the main in character and within context of the everquest world.  After this first installment all further stories will be told from the point of view of Sindarre.  I thought upon how to bridge the link between players and their characters.  Mainly because much of what you see in the character is a reflection of the player.   And there is often a story be told on the other side of the screen as well.  As a literary device I will be using the idea of guardian angels to accomplish this while attempting to stay within &quot;role&quot;.  In many ways that is how I viewed my interaction with Sindarre.  Me the player looking over her shoulder and whispering in her ear like a guardian angel.  Helping to guide a person I could never really be.  Also of note is the fact that I don't have much talent or experience for this sort of thing.  But I thought it might be fun and I have a bit of free time as of late.  So I do hope you enjoy these little tales.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Dedicated to Kestri.  Whose wonderful stories prompted me into writing my own.  hugggggles</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Cold.  Why did the lands upon which adventurers walk become so damn cold?  Katrin Frostpaw hated the snow.  The brisk cold wind, the desolation and bleakness of these new lands was not something she could mentally endure for long.  She preferred the green of the forest and the warm embrace of the sun.  Kunark, now that was a land you could love.  Endless woods, beautiful waterfalls, and it was agreeably nice and warm.  Sure the leeezards were kind of an annoyance but you got use to them after a time and a few had kind souls beneath their scales.  She would return to those lands soon enough she told herself as she stared out into nothing but ice and snow. She was not here in the west wastes to chase down another dragon just to watch it flow across the hills.  Nor was she here to watch a great gathering of adventurer’s stake their claim to honor and riches through the blood of those same dragons she loved to watch.  She was here because somewhere in this land, visited by a precious few, she would find her sister.  <br><br>Katrin let out a soft curse while she shook off the snow that had accumulated on her shoulders during the short journey.  She found her sister, as she often did, simply sitting on a hill staring off into nothingness.  Of course Sindarre would tell her that she loved gazing out upon the simple beauty of these ice-covered lands.  But Katrin never saw what her sister loved so dear out here.  To Katrin the harsh nature of this place tainted any glimpse of beauty to be seen. <br><br>&quot;Hiya sis.&quot;<br><br>Sindarre turned to the familiar voice somewhat amazed that she heard it so soon after their last visit.  &quot;Hello Katrin.  What brings you out here?&quot;<br><br>Katrin responded quickly.  &quot;Messages from the world.  I have another story or two from that bard you have come to adore.  And accounts of your old friends exploits.  Also there is a few matters and letters that I think you should respond to quickly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All of these could have waited on my return to town Sis.  You did not come out in this weather to deliver me mail hun.  What is on your mind?&quot;<br><br>After a long pause Katrin continued knowing that dancing around the issue would only be a waste of time.  &quot;I come to ask you a favor Sindarre.  I come to ask you to tell me about your old friends so I can pass on these stories.  Much has been told about Silent Redemption’s victories and journey's.  But you rarely hear a tale of the members themselves.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why would anyone want to know these things.  The people who would care already know the people of which we would speak.  They have walked the same lands.  Asked all their questions when they caught us relaxing or preparing for a particular event.  They have joined us in battle and in celebration.  It's not like we were so far ahead and so untouchable that you could not get a feel of who we were and what my old friends continue to do even to this day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know that sis.&quot;  Replied Katrin.  &quot;But stories about people are quite beautiful in their own little way.  They give a small peak at something they may have not seen before in someone.  I know I would like to get a idea of who these people really are.&quot;<br><br>Sindarre let her gaze drift out over the snow banks again while she thought upon what her sister asked.  After a moment she replied softly.  &quot;But that is part of being what we are.  Running about playing the brave heroes ensures that we lose our identity to all the stories and tales that are born from the accomplishments of the guild.  You could never know the true Kambing or Alderon because they know their role and part in the world.  I often wondered how much different we might have looked to others if we never drew our blades against Vox or Nagafen.  I wondered how much different we would have acted even around each other if we never set foot in Trakanon's lair that first time.  What you ask for can't truly be delivered because there was always all of that hanging over your head.  And of course there is the very real gap between you and your guardian angel and the gap between them and their guardian angel.  Besides... if you want to know about someone it is usually best to ask him or her in person.  They were there for the whole story while I could only relate bits and pieces.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perhaps we could give people a glimpse then.&quot;  Said Katrin  &quot;A small glimpse of those who you spent so much time with.  Besides it might be good for you and perhaps good for your guardian angel to share those times.  Who knows, maybe it will even be fun sis?&quot;  <br><br>And this was Katrin's last argument on the subject.  You could only push Sindarre so far on anything before her fangs came out so to speak.  But it was enough.  She gave her sister a long hug and then left Sindarre to the snow and wind she loved.  <br><br>A few days later Katrin packed up her backpacks and after a few short words landed softly in the Karana's.  She was to meet her sister in Halas, which meant a short run across the plains, and more snow and ice and wind to greet the wood elf on the last half of the journey.  But she did not mind it this time.  She was eager to hear a story.  A story her sister only hinted at out in the west wastes.  The story of Sindarre's journey's with one of the Danger Rangers.   A small glimpse of Ganon the Danger Ranger.<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  to be continued</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br> <p><B><A HREF = "http://sr.amiga.tm/cgi-bin/members.cgi?show=Sindarre">Sindarre Frostpaw</A></B><BR>57ish Retired Warrior of Silent Redemption<BR><I>"May trouble neglect you......"</I><BR><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new"><IMG ALT="Retired Silent Redemption Member" BORDER=0 SRC="http://fairblade.sinbad.net/images/SRlogo.gif"></A></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usindarreofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sindarre of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/12/01 2:52:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukestrithebard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KestriTheBard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Board Moderator  <br><font color=#A0B0E0>&lt;Clan Spiritslammer&gt;  </font></span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/12/01 7:05:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=331.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The beginning...</span><hr size=1> Ack!
