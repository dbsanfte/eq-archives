I think that every class should be ballanced at this level because there is no place else to go.<br>
<br>
If paladins are average at 54 you can always get to 59 and be much better.<br>

If you are so so at 60 theres no place really to go. <p><center><img

There will always be someone who thinks differently than another..<br>
<br>
CASTER balance means ALL casters not just int casters.. including shamans druids clerics etc.<br>
<br>
Some classes are fine and could benefit from generic changes<br>
Some classes need work and special attention<br>
<br>
I think all the INT casters need to be looked at..<br>
<br>
Most of the Wis casters are fine except for the druids..<br>
<br>
Comparing paladin damage to int caster damage is stupid.. Paladins aren't there for damage output.. <br>
<br>
Int casters are.<br>
<br>
Necros and mages are nothing more than mana whores right now.. <br>
<br>
I dont know what can be changed to fix that but there might be something.<br>
<br>
Wizards need some changed too.. Wizards are nothing til 60 and then need to work hard in order to match rogues in damage output<br>
<br>
Enchanters.. i feel they are fine but some enchanters would disagree.<br>
<br>
Melee are not behind casters before 60.. You can dual weild jade maces and beat casters in output..<br>
<br>
That doesnt seem fair to me <p><center>

<br>
A meele has to deal 24 DPS to beat him. In grind groups with speed I currently deal between 50-70 DPS. About 2-3 times as much as the wizard. On raids I deal around 40-50DPS but also heal a significant amount of AoE damage.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

A Paladin does 70 DPS you say?  that's 4200 DPM.<br>

So a spell that takes 120 mana, does 1400 damage has a cast time of 5 seconds recast time of 15 seconds would produce the exact same DPM with a MCPM of 360.<br>

<br>
Don't forget that AoE spells throw DPM right out the window.  If you've got an AoE spell that does 800 damage, then that's potentially 3200 damage (or lots more, if it doesn't have limited targets).

Each expansion has dramatically increased the power of the melee classes with the introduction of better items. If you compare the best weapons available in kunark to the best weapons available now, you can see that melee damage output has essentially doubled since kunark.<br>
<br>
One of the gripes that casters have is that there is so much good gear flooding the lower levels that most melee classes can outdamage casters considerably. A level 30 paladin with one of the decent DN 2 handers, some DW/barbed ringmail armor, an FBSS, and a fungi is going to be able to solo much better than any caster his level, regardless of the gear the caster has.<br>
<br>
The same thing is true at higher levels. That is why VI is introducing so many FT items, it is their attempt to allow items to enhance casters in a meaningful way. They are also using the ancient spells to try to fix this problem. The only other thing I can think of doing is spell casting haste on items and more/better focus items for pet classes. <p>Graal MacBladefury<BR>

And also I think casters should agree with melee's on a few things also.<br>
<br>
The leveling part of the game is what I am talking about first.  Melee's for most of their life do not solo effectively (notice I did not say &quot;can't solo&quot;), whereas casters can except for a few exceptions perhaps with clerics/enchanters (which can generally find a exp group easy enough that its not even a real issue).  During this time melee's are forced to run from zone to zone to find a group, without the aid of a close bind/gate/ports/sow and so on for the most part, whereas a caster can solo to 60 np in decent time.  Point is, melee's are very dependant.  Melee's without invis are even more so dependant even when they can run to most areas.  Yes I know with pp and friends that most of this is a non-issue, but even with pp and friends you can still have a problem finding a port.<br>
<br>
So we level up.  The situation is different, but some things still remain.  At higher levels casters can still solo, most melee can to some degree, but I would still say that 7 or 8 times out of 10 a melee is going to get better exp in a group, unless they have some nice gear.  As a paladin I can solo undead effectively, but no where near the efficiency of a root/dot, fear kite, quad kite and so on...and absolutely no comparison to a AoE group.  So, once again, these two things are very large boons to the caster classes which can make use of them, and melee is left somewhat cold (except for the few that can get in on AoE groups lol) still pretty much dependant on friends helping them.<br>
<br>
Now I am not saying that this justify's the end raiding situation we are facing now with casters, but I want to know that if the raid situation is bumped up..why can't we bump up this solo disparity/dependancy also?  Seem's unfair to adjust one and not the other IMHO.   <p><B>Ruadin Stoutheart, Knight of Brell</B><BR>

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> Casters should *NOT* (am i stressing this enough?) outdamage a melee group member over a long battle.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because they would *DIE*! <br>
<br>
They would steal aggro from the melee, and fold after one serious hit. They don't have the HP or AC to take the blows.<br>
<br>
The purpose of caster damage is tactical Nuker.<br>
<br>
Delay, disrupt, and finish off the mobs.  Nuke at 80% to knock it down a bit, nuke to get it into 'flee' mode, nuke to fry a runner.<br>
<br>
I cannot tell you how much I love grouping with a wizard or other nuker that knows *when* to nuke.  They are almost as valuable as a healer who knows when to heal.<br>
<br>
Sure, give them spells with a shorter casting time, but *DON'T* let them out damage their meat shields in the long haul. <br>
<br>
Comparing casters, INT WIS or hybrid by the ridiculous term of DPS or DPM is a silly nearsighted game.<br>
<br>
Now, does it suck that Mages and Necros become merely mana banks for high level raids?<br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
I have only played a Paladin up to lvl 30. So, yes I am completely ignorant of the "High Level Game" and casters abilities at that level.<br>
<br>
*BUT*<br>
<br>
I do know that Verant has spent a lot of time giving each class distinct sets of skills and abilities. And that tactics and strategies for each class change over time.<br>
<br>
They are probably going to provide more variety to the capabilities of high level casters.<br>
<br>
I hope to the gods for the casters' sake that they do *NOT* make a wizard / mage / necro whomever capable of out damaging their meat shields.<br>
<br>
I also hope that casters realize that pulling out the DTS yardstick is like taking a ruler to your crotch.<br>
<br>

All faster casting spells will do is put a Caster OOM faster and make him/her even more efficient at soloing.

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> The balance argument has 2 parts.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
Part 1: pre-50, especially pre-50 AND pre-Kunark....<br>
Casters were VERY over-powered.  Melees had crap weapons (yaks).  A necro could solo the LGuk Lord room....meanwhile a group of 6 melees would wipe if they were foolish enough to try the same.   King room group only wanted pet-casters and healers....melees or any class (even warriors) were unwelcome.  Oh, I remember those ugly days of caster-farmers all too well.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
Part 2: current state of affairs:<br>
Melees got far better weapons and gear.<br>
In a grind, paladins typically do 40-50 dps (more if its undead), warriors 50, rangers 55, monks 70, rogues about 90-100.  Casters are lucky to do 30 dps...Only the mage epic pet is effective over the long-haul.<br>
<br>
Pathing is so crappy, and MOB-AoE spells so prevalent, that casters are prohibited from using pets on most raids.<br>
<br>
Wizards got great new bane spells, and specialized spells for killing dragons, etc.  AA points help wizards (and other casters) a lot. Wizards especially can now do incredible damage in brief times....like 10k in 30 seconds.  Wizards therefore get a great niche in raids.  Their evac capability and their porting abilities greatly aides their group-friendliness.<br>
<br>
AE groups emerge into reality.  Groups of wizards+chanter+cleric+tank puller (paladin is best) can clean up the exp now in fast-spawn areas.  After all the Luclin zone nerfs, Acrylia, HS and FG remain as great AE locations.  As a result of AE groups, wizards, chanters and clerics now can now reap in exp far faster than any other class.  Necros, mages, druids, shaman, and the non-plate melee classes are not well-suited for these AE groups, and are...well... rather screwed.<br>
<br>
++++++<br>
Summary of class balance, current state of affairs....<br>
<br>
Warriors:  with defensive ability, they own raid tankage.  Good for raids, exp groups, AE groups.  Member of the "holy trinity" (cleric/chanter/warrior).  Crappy AA advancement.  Many new good Luclin weapons.<br>
<br>
Paladins:  with recent class upgrade, they rock.  Great fit in raids (patch heals, LOH cycles, add tankage).  Great in single groups (tankage, stuns, patch heals).  Best pull class for AE groups. Good spells (buffage, heals, haste, undeads).  Very good at crowd control. Great AA advancement opportunity.  Many new good weapons.<br>
<br>
SKs: Best at grind tankage (lifetap self-healage).  Good pullers.  Good for raids.  Some decent spells.  Good AA advancement opportunity.  Many new good weapons.<br>
<br>
Rangers: Good damage dealers.  Good fit in raids.  Acceptable tankage class in many one-group grinds - if they have ToV gear.  Great choice for the "extra spot" in a grind group with their spell set and damage output.  Good spells (buffage, epic-slow, patch heals, utility spells, SNARE).  Very good at crowd control. Can have a hard time finding groups, because some sucky players gave rangers a bad rep.  Great AA advancement opportunity in archery allows for quite high-level damage output.  Not a top-tier choice for AE groups.  Post-Velious weapons are crap.<br>
<br>
Monks:  Pullers extraordinare.  High damage.  Good fit in raids.  Good in grind groups.  No CC ability.  Not a top-tier choice for AE groups.  Crappy AA advancement.  Easiest epic with stackable haste.  Many new good Luclin weapons.<br>
<br>
Rogues:  Top damage dealers.  Great raid fit.  Good in grind groups.  No CC ability.  Unwelcome in AE groups.  Second easiest epic. Crappy AA advancement.  Many new good Luclin weapons.<br>
<br>
Bards:  Great utility class.  Great for raids, and grind groups.  Always wanted...almost a member of the "holy trinity".   Many new good Luclin weapons.<br>
<br>
Beastlords.  Too early to say, but they don't look that group friendly in dungeons, and may not contribute enough to raids...because of pet pathing issues.<br>
<br>
Clerics:  Invaluable.  Member of the "holy trinity" (cleric/chanter/warrior).  AE groups.  CH ability overpowers all other healers, esp on raids.  Need I say more?<br>
<br>
Druids:  Great ultility class (heals, ports, buffage, evacs, utility spells, nukage, DoTs).  Good in grind groups, good in raids, good solo (quad kiting).  I would label druids as the "most underappreciated class", as they often have a hard time finding grind groups, but shouldn't.<br>
<br>
Shaman:  Great ultility class (heals, buffage, utility spells, DoTs, haste, slow).  Very desired in grind groups, required in raids, good solo.  Less "stackable" in raids though.<br>
<br>
Chanters:  Invaluable.  Member of the "holy trinity" (cleric/chanter/warrior).  AE groups.  Dire charm with AA investment.  Not that stackable in raids.<br>
<br>
Necros:  Another good utility class of underappreciated value.  This class lost their focus as a "mean damage dealer" post-50.  Hard time finding grind groups.  Not that stackable in raids.  Unwanted in AE groups.<br>
<br>
Wizards:  Cornerstone of AE groups.  Highly raid desired.  Soloes well (quad+ kiting).  Their evac capability and their porting abilities greatly aides their group-friendliness, but they often have a hard time finding groups.  Great AA opportunites.  Many great spells.<br>
<br>
Mages:  Pet-pathing issues greatly limit their effectiveness on raids and indoors.  Nukes are resisted too-often in raids.  Good choice in normal grind groups.  Not that welcome in AE groups.<br>

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> I stand corrected on the decrease casting times.  That was pulled out of thin air.<br>
<br>
I stand by the rest, with one addition, possibly give casters (other than the chanters Tash series) a means to reduce the resistance of the mega mobs.<br>
<br>
Sure, casters have less DPS over the long haul.<br>
<br>
I reiterate.  *GOOD*<br>
<br>
Don't concern yourself with averaging damage over a 5, 10, 60 minute fight.<br>
<br>
Concern yourself with the crucial seconds that matter.<br>
<br>
Most important time to do massive damage:  Runner Nail 'em before the snare / root breaks.   I hate chasing runners, I am (pally) doing what 30 DPS?  They are running with 300hps.  Will take me forever to get kill them while running, with probably misses etc<br>
<br>
Caster nukes for 350hp, mob dead.<br>
<br>
I may have dealt out 900hp of dam over the 30 second fight, for 30DPS.  The caster did 350hp in the 30 sec fight, for 11DPS.<br>
<br>
Whose damage was greater?  who cares, I fulfilled my role, he fulfilled his.<br>
<br>
If you are on a raid, are the wizards supposed to be Nuking the mob as the puller brings it in?  Noooooooo, they must wait til the MA builds aggro.  MA builds aggro by doing fast damage.<br>
<br>
Nukers are crucial not for their sustained damage dealing, but for their properly timed tactical nukes.<br>
<br>
I reiterate:<br>
<br>
I also hope that casters realize that pulling out the DTS yardstick is like taking a ruler to your crotch.<br>
<br>
The measurement doesn't matter, knowing how and when to use it does. . . <br>

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> As Haldurin discussed, average caster damage should not be raised to average meele damage when look at on say, an hour grind. The ability of casters to deal damage very fast by burning hard and the advantage of that needs to be compensated with a lower average DPS over an hour grind. (For example a grind group with a mage without hard CC has an add. The mage sics the pet on add and burns him down faster than the other 4 meeles can beat one mob down)<br>
<br>
Currently I think the caster DPS level is a little too low and more importantly does not raise enough with equipment upgrades. The average mana regen rate of a caster with c2 is 360mana/minute. The newly introduced flowing thoughts item allow that number to increase by 150mana/minute. That is not surprisingly a 41% increase, similar to the best haste items in game. So FT items are the caster equivalent of haste belts. <br>
<br>
I think the ancient spells are aimed to simulate some of the increases that came when a meele went from a kunark weapon to a velious weapon, e.g.  going from a FD 35/40 to a 53/46 WTOV weapon. Good ancient spells that have superior mana/damage ratios need long cast and recast times to prevent their use in solo situation. Possible like CC have a delay before you can cast another spell to prevent rerooting of mobs in solo situations making them purely useable for grinds.<br>

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> Look at the Malo line of spells, we have a way to reduce resistances. The problem is fast pulling groups and end game mobs where we cannot keep up with melee in damage where we used to outdamage them quite easily. Magicians being able to use their pets would help solve the problem, but even with this our pets have trouble hitting mobs 20 levels above them. With the 4 pet per mob rule that has now been stated by Verant, no matter how nice our pets are, if a few charmable mobs are close the epic will be kept in its orb. 4 pets per mobs needs to be removed. We need spells/skills to make our pets more powerfull in the end game. Pets need to be made indifferent to all to reduce their train making ability. When was the last time a Warrior sword leapt from his hand, warped across the zone, then brought 20 mobs back to kill him? <p>Taoxek Trickyhands<BR>

<br>
""""Wizards: Cornerstone of AE groups. Highly raid desired. Soloes well (quad+ kiting). Their evac capability and their porting abilities greatly aides their group-friendliness, but they often have a hard time finding groups. Great AA opportunites. Many great spells.""""""<br>
<br>
Got that one pretty right but wizards are still mainly desired on raids for ports only.. At 60 a wizard damage output increases to an almost acceptable lvl.. but before 60.. Wizard raid damage output.. purely sucks.. they have to use the pathetic damage output of lures.. yes they are low resistant but low damage too.. Almost a 2damage to 1mana ratio.. Where Solist's ice spear a lvl60 spell is around 4 to 1 damage output..<br>
Wizards need a lot of work pre 60.. At 60 i still think wizards need work but less work.. In a fight against vindicator i do about equal damage with giantsbane to a lvl60 rogue with epic.. That may seem ok.. but i have to use my mana robe and a few other tricks to get to that.. if I didnt.. Id probably be around the output of maybe 3/4 of that.. I dont think that is acceptable..<br>
What happens when that rogue gets a luclin weapon.. I dont have anything compared to that. I will continue to fall behind him in damage output..<br>
There are only 2 things wizards bring to raids.. Ports and nukes..<br>
I'm am at the raid to nuke not port.. I do that because I can. If i fall behind to where my output isnt adequate then there is a problem.<br>
<br>
Wizard balancing lies in mana regeneration and mana efficiency.<br>
<br>
Both need to be tweaked at 60 but even more so before 60.<br>

NO WAY</span><hr size=1> Ok I have read all the posts and it seems the same thing keeps coming up.  That in the past, casters could easily out damage melee's.  Now that has changed, that Melee's can out damage casters, if they have epics or top of the line weapons.  Why is this a bad thing and why should it change?  Look how long melee's went doing less damage and they managed to survive.  Casters have for the most part had it easy when it came to leveling and dealing the most damage in the past.  Why not let the melee's have the easy road for a while and let the casters take a harder road.  I really think the only way casters will be happy if they easily out damage melees.  I know when I go on small raids like Hate, Kael, ect.  If I have 2 nukers in my group, we usually wind up getting the xp versus if were are all melee.  Then again, our guild doesn't have a ton of epics and top of the line weapons for our melee.  I think most guilds don't and it's the exception and not the rule where the melee are out damaging the casters.<br>
<br>
I personally like having a couple of nukers in my group.  Even the druids get the job done with their nukes.  Again this isn't going up against epic mobs either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14722.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14722.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14722.topic&start=61&stop=74>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=14722.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=14722.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14722.topic&index=40><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=14722.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=14722.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14722.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14722.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
