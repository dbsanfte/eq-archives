Most of which were not roleplayers.  But there are 2 people who really stand out to me as roleplayers.  The first, who is the person who hooked me on EQ and helped me decide on a paladin is quite a roleplayer.  He is an SK of course (what did you expect? heh)  He is one of those people who's fun to hang out with in RL but if you tick him off in game he won't hesitate to DoT you and leave you to die at the hands of green cons after beating the living tar out of you.  In game he has a body count in his inspection window of all the different races he's killed and cooks their meat.  In the few times I saw him in game, he never broke character once.  He uses his friend list as a hitlist to keep track of people he is going to kill.  He can't wait to be able to kill the king in Kaladim or the halfling in the East Freeport rogue guild.  But of course, he especially can't wait to kill every single dark elf in Neriak.  hehe.  This is Ceyium on the Bertoxxulous server and he's a Dark Elf Shadowknight.<br>
<br>
2.  Last summer at Ceyium's house when I first made Avethar on his account, I got to level 5 and had some tattered armor and rusty weapons I got for doing an item transfer for a level 50+ person.  I was so very new to this game it wasn't even funny.  Well, maybe it was slightly humorous.  Anyway.  I decided to explore and, of course, I got lost.  I was killed by an orc centurion (so scary back then!) and lost my corpse!  I was crushed!  I lost the abundance of rusty weapons I had been giving away to all the level 1 characters!  I was no longer a big bad level 5, but a nekkid paladin running confusédly through the forest.  Anyway, I met a kind wood elven bard in kelethin who was level 11 and in.....FULL BANDED ARMOR!!!!!  He helped me get back on my feet and gave me some armor, a kite shield, and a mace.  Well time passed, after about 8 months I finished my computer and got EQ to work.  Imagine my surprise when I meet....yep, you guessed it.  That same bard.  He is now level 18.  I was so excited to see him!  Well, he left EQ within a month of my return, which crushed me.  BUT! He came back!  I was so happy to see him!  However, I was now level 22 or so.  I offered to powerlevel him and get him his equipment back, but that never happened.  I gave him anything I didn't need that he could use and helped him with his lambent armor quests up till when I cancelled my account when he was level 34 and I was 35.  We roleplayed a lot together.  He was an amazing roleplayer, also seemed quite versed in Latin.  <br>
So, who are your roleplaying friends, or do you even have any?<br>

I have met one serious roleplayer though, who goes to the extent of only walking through towns (was exploring Katta with her, and I was starting to get really bored <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), something I must admit is too much for me generally.<br>

When Verant first allowed us to change our names purple to rp mode, alot of us would do it and run around doing the whole m'lord, m'lady thing and it was quite fun. But then the power gamers started coming in and the overall effect was that rp gave way to leveling and acquiring loot. Although people still rp to an exstent, it is nowhere like it used to be. I started on Mith Marr server, but I am now on Drinal, so I cant speak for the other servers of course. I do however miss the days of people rp while grouped game the game an interesting twist.<br>

<br>
I got a tell from this guy on Saturday out of the blue. He called me a stinking Paladin and said he 'hoped I would die this day and that if I did not he would kill me tomorrow'.<br>
<br>
Then he logged.<br>
<br>
Should kinda warn him to let folks know he is gonna include them in the RP before he sends blind tells. I had no idea at all who this guy was.  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> figured</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it was RP but when he logged I thought it might have been a harrasser (since I am in a fast rising guild who has made some waves we get these from time to time).<br>
<br>
My guildmates said I should /petition and /report but I thought he was RPing so I let it go.<br>

Krillin, <br>
<br>
Tell this deluded child of hate that if he wishes I shall meet him in combat in the Arena of the Gods and we shall truly see who's deity is the true power. He is born of a weak and delude being. A godling who's eye I have stared into and who's form I have combated and have been victorious against. I hold no fear in the Innoruk, for I have seen his shell die. Were it not for the nature of Immortality his countenance would have been cleansed long ago from the memory of the races and the tribes of the Dal at long last reunited in peace and brotherhood, as we were before his dark master meddled in affairs not of his realm.<br>
<br>
The lord of lies and hate does naught but weaken his poor deluded followers. Hate is truly the only mortal perfection in existance for it needs only itself to feed on, needs only itself to exist and needs only itself to spread. But it also weakens itself in it's infection by destroying unity and removing the greateset of all power in a people: Brotherhood.<br>
<br>
I shall be glad to defend Tunare's name, Nature, the true race of the Dal and the Royal Family Thex whenever he can summon the courage to face me in honorable battle and not send messengers with idle faceless threats.<br>
<br>
Pitty the Tier'Dal, do not hate them. They were created in weakness and are flawed copies in their making. I weep for a race that knows no caring, no brotherhood and no truth.<br>
<br>
I weep for those astray from our Mother, Tunare.<br>

Expect tells from him again and yes, they will be in Role.  As I said he has never once broken role an time I saw him in game.  He laughs at anyone who goes out of character and doesn't take kindly to .... well, most anyone.  He is really struggling with the fact that no one really roleplays anymore, I told him he should get in touch with you.  But don't hesitate to tell him in game what you posted here.  Not sure when I'll talk to him next.  His play time is really limited right now.  I will try get him on here to read this and make an attempt at getting him to register and even answer to your post.<br>

We have a great time, and I have to say, it's rather scary, but I can actually read Ogre as fast as I read English now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=155825">Baron Sladen Paladian </a> <BR>

Im his Lackey, names Zipparian Badgerbane, halfling warrior. My master is currently away for a long period of time. So Im on my own, not so bad, partys are fun, all night drinking binges. Well back to my point, I saw this guy Ceyium in karana, and when I looked at his item list he had a kill list. My master and several other people were on it. So I told this stupid DE that he had better watch who he threatens because Ill mop the floor with him for talking smack about my master. Anyway, he got all blah blah blah blah blah on me. Naturally I told him to shove it. We got in fight, he tried his little panzy Shadowknight tricks on me, but my master taught me how to deal with scum like this. So I did as I learned, and MOPPED KARANA WITH HIS UGLY FACE. One kill later I wait for him to come back, hes really ticked, we go at it again. Same result, but before he died he cried like a little baby and tried to run from a honorable fight. oh and im only lvl 25, Gilfalas this guy is all talk. But I dont think you will have any problems with him anymore. OH and if anyone needs a lackey please look me up sometime, im free for a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukronadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kronadin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/3/02 12:31:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.liwest.at/keiser/eqpics/song24465.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I whooped this guy!</span><hr size=1> You killed him at lvl 25?
