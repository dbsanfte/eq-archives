<br>
If you look at the lower level groups, amonst all the twinks you'll see quite a few people in banded/bronze, possibly with a nice item or two for their level that someone gave or sold to them. The problem is the NRo-Oasis-LOIO-OT path is nice if you're a twink and don't need to earn a lot of money or to get some of the better drops. But if you're starting fresh you've got to hit the dungeons, which are now grossly underpopulated. IF you do get a group in runnyeye, chances are you'll end up with two blackened alloy sleeves instead of a full suit. If you're lucky you'll find a buyer who'll give you slightly more than the vendor price for the extra.<br>
<br>
Likewise dieing in a highly populated dungeon really isn't that big of a deal, just carefully walk through the overcamped dungeon until you get back to where you fell. Total party whipeout in an underpopulated dungeon? Hope some high levels are camping the entrance next door in SOLB and are willing to help you get your body's back. I really wish I would have been around in the days when you could actually find people in remote dungeons.<br>
<br>
If you haven't got high level help, I imagine EQ can be quite daunting for a new player now. Standing next to supertwink and wonding why you're doing half his damage. Not being able to find a PC buyer for anything you can loot (sometimes even newbie treasures like bonechips are hard to sell. I don't even bother to try to sell bat wings anymore, I just trade them for binds/buffs). <br>
<br>
I honesty think all the low level changes will help the new player more than the twinks. Someone's alt can usually call a high level friend for a rez. A group of true newbies don't have that option right now, but with the new spells, they can at least get something.<br>

How will these changes help the Powerleveled character much? That seems to be the guy who'd benefit the least.<br>

<br>
Congratulations, you're completely nuts.<br>
<br>
Smoothing out hell levels does NOTHING to speed up 1-50.  All they're doing is taking the &quot;extra&quot; exp that hell levels currently require and &quot;spreading it out&quot; over the non-hell levels.  It'll still take the same total exp to get there.<br>
<br>
And if you think that not having to chase down your corpse a few times from 1-10 is going to CUT IN HALF the amount of time it takes you to get from 1-50, well, I've got a bridge in the Karanas I'd like to sell you.<br>
<br>
For pete's sake, people, get a grip.<br>
<br>
Mostly Verant is removing the most aggravating parts without making it any &quot;easier&quot;, per se.  You're still going to have to kill tens of thousands of mobs to crank from 1-50, that will change very little.  They're just easing some of the more needlessly painful aspects of the journey.<br>
<br>
Will you be able to PL a twink pretty rapidly from 1-50?  Sure, but then you could *always* do that.  And your second character, even if untwinked (yeah, right!) also benefits from the fact that you know a hell of a lot more about the game now than you did when you first worked your main from 1-50.<br>
<br>
None of the proposed changes make any substantial difference in how long it takes to slog an untwinked character from 1-50, *or* how long it takes to PL a twink up to 50.<br>
<br>
So relax and unwind.<br>

The second/thrid...it is just a matter of finding a spot that you can mow down unlimited mobs for max exp.<br>
<br>
Leveling to 50 pre RoK was MUCH MUCH MUCH harder then after, p leveled or not.  There simply was not enough mobs to go around.  There was no loio, dl, ot etc.  At 40+ you had L Guk, where all the pallys hung out and you had Solb.  These places were mega camped and you had very few mobs you could kill per hour.<br>
<br>
Remember, the 40% exp penalty we had?  That is like having to get 2 extra YELLOW bubs each level to level, compared to now.  That sucked.  Try level 35/40/45 with that going against ya and killing 10 mobs in an hour with a full group and no group exp modifier like now.  On top of that everyone had complete crap equipment and killing was just took sooo long.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it was fun before RoK, just that it made you appreciate things more. I think people missed out on a lot of dungeon killing and earning of equipment.  <br>

<br>
Both can be fun i think it's just about what you want to do and what's more fun for you.  I see it as compared to a lot of other computer or video games.  We all know about back in the day with the Game Geniie and things like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I look at pling just like the cheat codes in other games.  It can be fun to be on god mode back in Doom (hehe that was a long time ago huh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  but the novelty wears off i think after a while.  What fun is it to breeze through the lvls that way?  Some people enjoy it some people dont.  I usually dont.  <br>
<br>
As has been said a big part of this game to me is about accomplishement and earning my way up to get to 60.  Now i have nothing to compare to about the difference between pre and post lvl 50... but i've enjoyed my time exploring and meeting new friends in the 40 lvls that i've been playin.  <br>
<br>
So if you wanna use the cheat codes, go right ahead, and more power to ya, but i for one am gonna go out and maybe do my ro bp and greaves just for the fun of it... Not because i need to, cause just like everybody else, i can easily pull together the cash for something better in half a day farming cash from HG's in RM, but because i want to.  Just thought i'd throw in a couple thoughts from a midlvl paly... and above all, enjoy yourselves at whatever lvl you want to be at, make some goals and meet some kewl peeps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh and BTW.. i'm a smith too... cause it's fun for me, adds to my gameplay and enjoyment of eq  regardless of what other people think of it  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
