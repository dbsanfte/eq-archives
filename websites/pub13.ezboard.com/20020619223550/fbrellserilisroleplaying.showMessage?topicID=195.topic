It was morning, but one could never really tell this day, as the skies were as gray as an elder dwarves beard. He was a mess really; he hadn’t shaved in days, which was evident by the stubble that was clearly showing on his face. He opened his eyes, involuntarily curling himself back into the corner of the small abandoned fishing hut on the river out on the great plains of Karana that he has been calling home for the past few weeks. It was comfortable to him, and that was what he needed most now. He stood to his feet groggily, in his black bodysuit that he wore under his armor, which lay in the opposite corner of the small hut and leaned himself against the side of the opening that looked out upon the river with a yawn. He found such peace, such beauty to this but that could not help him really as he leaned his head against the frame and looked down at his hands. Upon his ring finger was his engagement ring, a sparkling jade green ring that symbolized his engagement to the Elven bard, Leylia Krinnean. He looked at it thoughtfully for a few moments before closing his eyes and clenching his fists, sighing as he leaned his head back against the frame of the wooden hut. He had not seen her in weeks; he knew that she could take care of herself, but that didn’t give him much solace. It was unusual at best to of not heard from or seen of her all this time and he missed her. His thoughts drifted for a bit as the rain slowly eased his thoughts before opening his eyes once again, looking at his ring with a small sigh and a nod.<br>
<br>
“I hope you’re ok….” He said softly before clutching his hand again and diving into the cold river. <br>
<br>
The icy cold water was as good a wake up call as any as it raced over his body. He surfaced briefly for air, looking skyward, allowing the rain to fall onto his face before swimming out to the nearby waterfall. It was one of the luxuries of this area, providing him the opportunity to cleanse himself in Karanas own creations. He allowed the water to run over him for a while, lost in thought. He had come such a long way really, he had seen, and realized the fallacies of the way he had been taught as a knight. He had learned to feel, to care, he had learned to love. He almost felt like a real person, someone who was not brought up and indoctrinated into being something somebody else wanted him to be. He was beginning to feel, free. <br>
<br>
He climbed the ladder to the small hut, grabbing a nearby towel drying himself out as he began to replace the now wet body suit with a new one. He leaned back against the wall, running his hands through his hair and looked at his equipment lying in the corner of the hut. The silver and gold metallic pieces sparkled as if magically imbued, his long pike like blade draped over the top as it lay in a heap. He began thinking again, something he had only recently been able to do. For so long that were he, armor and a weapon. He looked at it carefully, empty, nothing, just a symbol, and he saw himself, or at least, what he was. She had changed that in him, she had taught him so much, how to really live. She had put something into that armor, not just an empty pawn, which he had been, but a real person, a person with feelings, a person who was able to think for himself, and he loved her for that.<br>
<br>
“Where are you….” He said with a sigh as he reached down for his armor and began the daunting task of putting it on. As he finished assembling the pieces together he grabbed his pole-ax, slinging it to his back and once again descended the ladder and into the water below. It wasn’t so easy this time, with his armor and weapon weighing him down as he swam to shore, standing to his feet and looking out over the seemingly endless river. He sighed one last time shaking his head and flexing his jaw briefly.<br>
<br>
“Can’t think about this now….” He said to himself as he lowered himself to the ground, squatting and picking up a handful of dirt into his hands, rubbing them together, as he had done had every morning for years. He didn’t particularly have anything to do this day, he had heard about the bandit uprising outside of Qeynos, seemed some new faction making noise, but he knew it was only that, and nothing more. He had heard of the lost child, Kaelya, seemingly having run away somewhere on the lost continent of Kunark. It worried him some, but it was nothing he felt he could truly be of assistance at, especially since at last word it seemed Katera Z’Asirithe herself was on the hunt, as he knew if she found him meddling in her affairs, she would not be pleased. <br>
<br>
“I guess I could sit on my ass all day feeling miserable about myself” he said softly to himself.<br>
<br>
“Why you look like an absolute wreck.” Came a cold, deep voice from behind him, surprising him as he sprung to his feet, eyes wide as he took a step back to face the owner of the voice. Standing before him was human man, a bit taller than Crystallian himself, his face horribly scarred with an eye patch covering his left eye, draped in jet black plate mail he looked directly into Crystallian with his one eye, almost as if he were looking directly into his soul. Shaken a bit, the knight managed to speak<br>
<br>
“Well, thank you for your concern, but I’m really not interested in it” he managed to say as he narrowed his glance upon him. There was something familiar about the man, but he could not place it. <br>
<br>
“You should be, you should welcome it, embracing it.” He said with a sneer<br>
<br>
“Well, I appreciate the offer, but I’ll be fine. I didn’t catch your nam…” the knight responded before being interrupted mid sentence<br>
<br>
“No, you won’t be fine Crystallian. See, you have something that I desire.” The man said coldly and clearly.<br>
<br>
Shocked, that the man knew his name, Crystallian backed up a step his inclining his head briefly in a sideways glance. “You kno…What do you want?”<br>
<br>
“I want your soul, your being. You want to feel, Crystallian? You want to understand, to know? I will show you how..” the man said, his face growing darker as he stepped nearer to Crystallian.<br>
<br>
Breathing a bit heavily now, the knight returned the gaze, clenching his jaw tightly. “Who are you?” came his question clearly with a demanding tone. The man laughed as his body began to take on an almost red aura as he neared Crystallian closely.<br>
<br>
“I am what you have always wanted to know, boy. I am what you don’t dream about. I am everything that is really inside of you, everything that you have buried. You want to open yourself, you want to know yourself, then know me, because I, Crystallian, am the thing that should not be, but am. I am the one you will never be rid of. You will feel, Crystallian.” The scarred man said his voice rising, but every bit as dark and evil. His hands now glowing as he raised them with a wild, insidious smile. Crystallian clenched his teeth as he pushed back against the man, but to no avail as he gripped him tightly upon the shoulders, his other hand, glowing as red as the fires of Solusek lying upon his chest.<br>
<br>
“You will know! You will feel, just as you have wanted. You will feel me, and what you have done to me. I am very very real Crystallian. Now you shall know just how so.” He cackled as his eyes burned red. Crystallian began feeling the heat upon his chest as he breathed heavily, the mans hand burning through his armor. <br>
<br>
“And now, you suffer for your sins. You shall burn for what you have done. Feel me, and what I am!” the man cackled loudly his laugh blood curdling, as he threw his head back, his hand burning through Crystallians’ chest, inside of him. The knight cried out in pain as he felt the scorching burning hand reach inside of him, but it was drowned out by the maniacal laughter of the man. Crystallian cried out once more, before all went dark.<br>
<br>
He gasped for air as he awoke suddenly. The rain trickled down his face as he lay on his back looking up into the still grayed skies. He frantically felt around his body, looking to his chest. Everything seemed, and felt normal. He looked around his surroundings, tilting his head from side to side. He was on the banks of the river, not far from the small fishing hut. His breathing heavy, and rapid began to slow down some as he calmed himself, his head throbbed with pain, and his body ached. Was it real? He thought to himself. He crept a hand over his chest and clutched it with a long sigh. His glance turned down to the hand, and once again to the ring that was upon it. He looked at it as the raindrops washed down the sparkling jewel. And as the rain fell, he closed his eyes tightly a single tear streaming down his cheek, mingling with the streams created by the falling rains, as he lay there, by the banks of the river, under the cloudy, rainy Antocian skies. As he lay there, alone.<br>
