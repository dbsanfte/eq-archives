Almorte D'Frag was defeated in the 12th century of the Combine Empire.  He was the one that dug the passage behind the waterfalls in High Hold Pass and launched a surprise attack on the Keep.  After a 22 day seige the great Wizard Ixian harnessed the power of ice and sent it like a bolt, destroying D'Frag's army.  Erollisi, it's still the most powerful spell in Norrath.  I can't believe you don't remember.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres sulked.  &quot;How can you eat all that sugar?  You're going to ruin your figure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Father says I must have weight to support my voice.  You should eat one too.  Father thinks you're too frail, you know.  Says you'll burn right up in your first performance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres perked up.  &quot;Did he say when it would be?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not telling.&quot;  Katrina absentmindedly rubbed her bottom remembering what had happened last time she told Cerres her father's plans.  &quot;And don't you try to change the subject.  If you fail this exam for a fifth time, Father will take you off the performance roster for a whole 'nother year.&quot; <br>
<br>
Katrina continued quizzing Cerres.  &quot;Kiros E'Kerion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know.  House of something, some kind of battle with black blades.&quot;<br>
<br>
Katrina rolled her eyes.  &quot;You're not even trying.&quot;  Getting up with the false hauteur of her elders, Katrina looked scornfully at Cerres.  &quot;I wash my hands of you,&quot; she said mimcking Braeta and skipped out of the kitchen giggling uncontrollably.<br>
<br>
Cerres bit  back her envy.   She rememberd being Katrina's age, doting on her father, still carefree and able to laugh.   Cerres looked at the warm sugar buns and fought back her queasiness.   Reluctantly she took a tiny bite.  It tasted like the sands of the Oasis, it's dryness filled her mouth.  She grabbed the half glass of milk Katrina hadn't finished and choked it down.  The gooish mass sat  in her stomach like lead.  She knew Katrina was right.  She could tell by the hang of her tunic that she'd lost weight.  But no matter how she tried, Cerres could not force herself to eat anymore than she could force herself to study.  <br>
<br>
All she could do was sing.  And that she was forbidden except in her lessons.  Cerres stared at the open book in front of her, trying to will herself to read.  The words blurred before her eyes and a distant numbness set in.<br>
<br>
Clap! Clap! Clap! &quot;Cerres!&quot;  Cerres startled as she heard Braeta's voice and watched Breata's arms jiggle as she clapped her hands to get her attention.  &quot;Holy Mithaniel, I thought ye'd gone catatonic on me.  Come on, get up now.  I need this table for me pies.&quot;  Breata clucked her tongue as she looked at the plate of buns still there.  &quot;I'm guessing the four that are gone are in Katrina's stomach and this one with the tiny bite out of it is yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres mumbled &quot; I'm sorry.  I tried.  I'm just not feeling well.&quot;  Cerres  rose dreamily as though a wraith from another land partially inhabited her body.  She placed the book under her arm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye never are, child.  Ye eat less than a mouse.&quot;   Breata popped Cerres hard in the bottom with her dishtowel.  &quot;Move, now, skidaddle.  I've no time to waste me pity on ye.  Ye'll do as ye want no matter what I say so  I've washed my hands of ya.&quot;  Breata dipped her hand in a bucket of flour and tossed it onto the table.  &quot;Foolish lass.  Lost in her own world, that one is.  Nothin' good'll come of it, I'll tell ye.&quot;  Breata mumbled to herself as she turned the huge bowl of dough onto the floured table and began working it lightly with her fingers, not too much lest she toughen the crusts.<br>
<br>
Cerres floated out into the garden.  She paused under a tree listening to the wren's song trilling to its mate.  &quot;Return to me, the children are hungry&quot; it said.  Cerres looked for the nest in the tree, but couldn't see it.   At the far end of the garden, next to a fountain gurgling into a pond filled with large spottled koi, her friends sat assembled around Master Jycinth.<br>
<br>
Cerres wandered closer to the group, just able to pick up the drone of the teacher's voice without understanding.  Sytal, an arrogant young tenor who took excessive pride in his voice not deepening when it changed, saw Cerres and poked his neighbor Krysta and pointed.  The two looked at her and snickered.  Cerres backed away.  <br>
<br>
Master Jycinth heard the muffled laughter and followed the direction of Styal's eyes.  He saw Cerres trying to sneak behind a tree and smiled.  &quot;Ahh, Cerres.  Come, join us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres stepped forward tentatively.  Sytal snorted,  &quot;Master, she can't join us.  She's too dumb.  She can't even pass her first rank history exam.&quot;  The entire class giggled.  <br>
<br>
Jycinth ignored the class and approached Cerres.  He put his arm around her shoulder and escorted her to the group, showing her a seat in the circle and welcoming her to sit.  &quot;We were just discussing the nature of superiority  Are some people really superior or is it weakness that causes them to denigrate others simply to puff themselves up?.&quot;  Master Jycinth looked directly at Sytal whose face reddened.  The class snickered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Which is the superior voice?&quot; Master Jycinth asked the class.  &quot;Is it the tenor, the soprano, the bass? &quot;<br>
<br>
Sytal raised his hand and was called upon.  &quot;Tenor!&quot;  He looked around the class for approval.  &quot;Tenor is the most rare and therefore superior.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Krysta blurted out &quot;Lyric Soparano is just as rare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, but it's a girl's voice so it's less valuable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Krysta punched him hard in the arm.  &quot;Well it's true!  If they hadn't banned incastrati there wouldn't be girls in the opera, all the parts would be played by men like they used to be before Ignatius.&quot;<br>
<br>
A full bodied bass asked, &quot;Is that how you kept your girlish voice, Sytal?&quot;  The entire class erupted in laughter.  Sytal threw his entire body against Aemoran and began pummeling him.  Aemoran extended a massive arm and held Sytal at a distance.  Sytal flailed, punching the air..<br>
<br>
Ignoring the outburst, Master Jycinth looked at Cerres and began a quiet conversation.  &quot;I'd like to know what you think, Cerres.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres felt comfortable with Master Jycinth.  He was thin and his voice was weak from an illness in his youth that still left him with a slight limp.  But his mind was sharp and he had a way of teaching that made his students adore him.  In Sytal's case it might take longer than most, but Jycinth had all the time in Norrath.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't see how you can judge any voice superior just by its range,&quot; Cerres answerd. &quot;I mean,  each contributes to the whole.  It is the blending together, the use of each unique characteristic that makes the music.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you think the same can be applied to people?  Or is one person really superior to another?&quot;  Aralen, Myrmion and Lytia leaned in closer to listen to the conversation.  Lytia had been Cerres friend when she was in the lower school as children.  It felt good to sit next to her again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I think it's the same thing.   One person may be a superior wrestler, &quot; Cerres looked at Aemoran who had placed Sytal in a head lock and was sitting peacefully waiting for class to resume while Sytal squirmed and kicked and muttered oaths of revenge.  &quot;But if everyone were a wrestler, who would write the music, or make weapons, or guard the temples, or heal the wounded?&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Jycinth smiled and turned to resume class.  &quot;I think you can let go now, Aem.  Nice head lock by the way.&quot;  Aemoran released Sytal who straightened his clothes and settled himself while glaring hard at the young wrestler.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Can anyone imagine Deanon's Bereavement without the sopranos?  Let's try it.  You all know the song.  Stand up.  Everyone but soprano's.&quot;  The class stood and sang.   Jycinth stopped them before the repeat.  &quot;What do you think, Myrmion?  Was that Deanon's Bereavement?&quot;<br>
<br>
Myrmion hated being called on in class.  He hesitated and looked around the group for shows of support.  He got none.  &quot;Well, yes and no.  I mean, it was parts of it but I wouldn't exactly say it was the whole thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So then,&quot; Jyacinth continued.  &quot;The soprano must clearly be the superior voice because if you take it away, the song is not whole.&quot;  Krysta poked Sytal in the ribs while lifting her carriage to its full height.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah?  Well try it without the tenors.  You'll see the same thing.  It won't sound right.&quot;  Sytal asserted, pointedly turning his back on Krysta.<br>
<br>
&quot;All right, tenors sit down, sopranos stand up and lets do that part again.&quot;  The class sang and everyone agreed, it still didn't sound right.  <br>
<br>
Master Songweaver lumbered into the garden and stopped.  &quot;Jycinth, what IS all this caterwauling you're doing.  Have you become a Master Singer while I was asleep?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, no, no, no.  We were just discussing which is the superior voice, tenor or soprano&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, nonsense.  Everyone knows it's the baritone.  Now stop wasting these children's time and teach something useful.&quot;  Master Songweaver winked slyly at Jycinth as he continued through the garden to the kitchen.  <br>
<br>
Jycinth coughed.  &quot;Well.  I suppose now that that is settled we can move on.  Tonight's assignment is to identify two organizations each of which claims superiority over the other and defend or deny the claim using the works of Syncromen or Rhitkus to argue your position.  Class dismissed.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the students ran off to their various practice rooms and classes, Jycinth caught Cerres' arm.  &quot;Walk with me a moment, will you, Cerres?&quot;    Cerres followed as they left the garden and entered the street.  &quot;You're not dumb, you know.  You're brighter by far than over half the class.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres blushed slightly and muttered, &quot;I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So why the history book.  Do you like being held back?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I try, Master Jycinth, I do.  But... it's so boring.  I can't see any application for it in my life.  Does it matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jycinth stopped at a local vendor.  He grabbed an orange from the cart, paid the vendor and began pealing it.  He tore off a section and handed it to Cerres and then popped one into his mouth.   Cerres sucked on the orange section as they walked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you heard about General Zirrix?&quot; he asked.  Cerres shook her head.  Jycinth handed her two more orange sections and continuued.  &quot;He is the greatest general the Tier'Dal have known in five generations.  Since Xorlov D'Plinth.  You do remember him don't you?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Mmmm, &quot; Cerres said,  pulling the section she'd been sucking on from her mouth.  &quot;Wasn't he the one who hid the five legions in the abandoned mineshafts in Butcher Block Mountains.  Was going to take over the Woodlands?  My great, great, great grandfather fought in that war.  Daddy told me about it.  It's how the Swiftfyre's got their name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jycinth stopped suddenly.  &quot;You're Sylvan of the Woods Swiftfyre's descendant?&quot;  Cerres nodded,  finished her orange section and gladly accepted another.  &quot;Of course, I should have known.  Your great, great, great, grandfather single-handedly destroyed five legions of Teir'Dal running the fire through the mines that night.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cerres laughed, &quot;Well, it wasn't single handed.  That's just legend.  But they did run fire through most of Butcher Block that night.  But there was more.  What this book doesn't say,&quot; she said pointing to the book she still had under her arm, &quot;is that there was also a legion camped in Lesser Faydwer prepared to catch the runners as they fled from the invasion.  Great, great, great grandmother took two regiments of druidesses, disguised as wolves, through the Tier'Dal camps.  The druidesses surrounded the camp with a single pack, rotating one wolf in from the front while one ran off to the back and turned herself into a tree.  The Tier'Dal were so dumb, not only didn't they notice the wolves changing, they never even noticed the sudden density of the forest.&quot;  Cerres laughed.<br>
<br>
Master Jycinth picked up another orange from a different vendor as they continued winding their way through the streets.  He handed it to Cerres and she began peeling it in her animation.  &quot;At the same time that the men lit fire to the mines, the women and children of Kelethin ran into Lesser Fay, pretending flight to escape the invading armies.  Only instead of fleeing into waiting arms like the enemy expected, they bore arms.  The women and children attacked from the front while the very trees the Tier'Dal retreated to for shelter attacked them from the rear. The legion  was outflanked.   Not one single troup escaped into Mistmoore that night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Jycinth stopped at a bread stall and picked up two loaves of hearth baked bread and some hard cheese.  &quot;I have never read that part of the story.&quot;  He broke of some bread and sliced some cheese and handed it to Cerres.<br>
<br>
Cerres took a bite of cheese and said, with her mouth full, &quot;You know why, don't you?&quot;   Jycinth shook his head.  &quot;Becausee it was women and children, that's why.   They couldn't honor a woman in legend so it was just buried.  But great, great, great grandfather kept the story alive, and it has passed from generation to generation of Swiftfyres.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jycinth sliced more cheese off and passed it to Cerres.  &quot;I wonder how many more legends there are that have been buried.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cerres answered through a mouthful of bread.  &quot;I'll bet lots.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cerres stopped and bought some wine, handing Jycinth a skin and downing nearly half a skin herself in one swallow.  Jycinth laughed and pulled the skin from her mouth, splashing wine on her chin.  &quot;Woah!  Don't get drunk on me, Master Songweaver will have my hide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't tell him, &quot;  Cerres said as she popped another bite of bread and cheese into her mouth and chased it with the rest of the wineskin.   She handed the vendor the empty wineskin and a gold coin for more.  <br>
<br>
Master Jyacinth took the wineskin from the vendor and grabbed Cerres by the arm.   &quot;Oh no you don't.  We'd better get you back.&quot;  They walked back to the Academy eating bread and cheese.  Cerres begged for wine which Jycinth parceled out in small, measured sips.  They laughed as they walked, thinking up hidden legends to all the great battles of history.  <br>
<br>
Before they re-entered the garden, Jycinth stopped and brushed the bread crumbs off of Cerres' tunic, wiped up the splashes of wine still dripping from her chin, and pulled a strand oh hair out of her face, placing it behind her ear.  &quot;You know,&quot; he said as they turned back into the school,  &quot;you may have just found your first libretto.&quot;<br>

Very good story you could feel your self being drawn in to story so much as to become Cerres and feeling the way she felt.  I could feel the feelings even the minor charracters had and that takes real talent to suck me in that far in just a few words <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
