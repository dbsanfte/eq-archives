If you had to remove ch and tone down mob mele, you should also either grant cleric/warriors some improvements or downgrade druids and hybrids.<br>
<br>
The big issue with improving druid healing is that in most places druids are already better than druids for the healing spot (specially if hteres slower available). Increase even more druid heals, and they not only are top soloers but will also become the preferred xp group healers. And this combination (top soloing/preferrred healer in group) is not only overpowering, but it nerfs into oblivion the niche in xp groups clerics have.<br>
<br>
That petition asks druids to be 2nd healers DAMN close to clerics, 2nd dotters DAMN close to whoever holds the dot crown, and also asks for increasing the already extremely nice druid debuff line. Thats clearly unbalancing and overpowering. What will be next? defensive disc, self ch and manaless manaburn for one-druid-ntov raids? Realize that most classes have a limited role in the high end raiding game, and if some are required in masse is mostly due to verants poor design. Realize that there must be some kind of balance between classes, between soloing and grouping. Finally realize that druids are already a damn nice rounded class, and realize also that the petition just is another step in the druid tradition of belitling themselves to whine for upgrades. You are not a useless class, no matter what the glade moderators want you to believe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=orun>Orun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/8/02 3:24:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15171.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> -_-</span><hr size=1> PoTG please O_x<br>

<br>
The important distinction that needs to be made for druids is raid vs non-raid.<br>
<br>
Currently, non-raid... druids are fine.  A few things would be nice, like the Nexus port.  The epic effect isn't super useful... but then, only a few really are.  They tend to be healers... that and snare are why they get added to groups, SoW at lower levels.  Their dots are hard to resist and provide plenty of damage.  Groupwise, they can keep a group healed.  Not as well as a shaman, but that's because the shaman can slow.  Give the druid a slower though and you are fine.  CH is simply not necessary.  Without CH though, you are better off with a slightly more melee heavy group and dividing damage so that regen is most effecient.<br>
<br>
I run a paladin/enchanter combo.  With that, the paladin pulls, heals, buffs (all but symbol, though AC buff comes from BP), and fights.  He doesn't sit and med.  Matter of fact, adding a shaman or cleric to my group is less effecient in many areas because the healing/slowing power isn't needed.<br>
<br>
But on raids... here druids suffer.  A druid isn't a wizard.  And a druid isn't a cleric.  Wizards do insane damage.  They get resisted less and have a much better selection of nukes to choose from with AA abilities that help them out.  Clerics have complete heal.  Now, druids do get a couple of useful buffs/debuffs.  But that's a 1 druid job.  All the rest spend their time not being wizards or clerics.<br>
<br>
Do I think druids should get a group heal?  No.  No way.  This ability is what makes paladins very nice on raids.  Give it to druids and paladins suffer.  The wrong class to cut into for raid desirability.<br>
<br>
I do think that druids need an improvement in healing.  Single target healing.  Because it is the cleric who's must have factor needs to be cut in to.  The first change to make would be to lower the level 60 heal to 57 or 58.  The second would be something to cut into the CH dependency.<br>
<br>
A percentage heal would be nice, if Verant's engine can handle that (which I doubt... notice CH is 10k, not 100%).  So assuming that isn't possible, something like a 2800 point heal, 10 second cast, 400 mana, at level 60.  It's a nice heal, 7:1 effecient.  But not enough to heal a main tank from the pummelling of a major mob.  What this means is that it takes 2 druids to equal 1 cleric on a raid in the healing role.<br>
<br>
Does this hurt the desirability of clerics in xp groups?  Probably.  You already don't need clerics in many areas.  Giving druids a better heal makes them more desirable.  Should clerics be compensated for it?  That's another question.  And the answer is yes.  Don't ask me exactly how... but it should be something that gives them some versatility in xp groups, without touching upon their raid desirability.  Another option would be to make this druid heal take a pearl each cast.  A minor cost for a raid.  But adds up fast for xp groups.  That way, the druid heal becomes a big boss mob heal only. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=15171.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=15171.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15171.topic&index=60><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=15171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=15171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15171.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15171.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
