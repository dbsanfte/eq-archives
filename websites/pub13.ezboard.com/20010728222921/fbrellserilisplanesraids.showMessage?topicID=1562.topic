Knowing how the Brell populace seems to be contesting raid schedules more and more these days, I'm not too eager to throw in something new to chew over (or get chewed over), but I guess I should still try to work with the system.  So here goes.<br>
<br>
Over the life of my main character I've been cultivating a roleplay story for him as much as I've gameplayed him to level and loot.  And now my character is on the cusp of hitting 46th level.  For roleplaying purposes I feel it is important to send my character headlong into Fear soonafter that level rings out.  Likely alone.<br>
<br>
This may seem crazy, and either way the reasons for doing this are irrelevant to get into here, (aside: if you're really curious, then catch me in game and roleplay with me for awhile to get some clues).  Basically, it's going to happen sometime in the next few weeks or so, and I want to make sure there's enough of a chance to discuss ideas on how best to make it work.  I'm assuming that a lot of people probably don't want random plane newbies running around training Cazic's minions during their scheduled raid time.<br>
<br>
Certainly, I want to keep from interfering with the raid schedule.  But I generally wouldn't accept that there is no room on the schedule for roleplay.  And I really don't need much room to squeeze this in.<br>
<br>
Any ideas? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uphazy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phazy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/24/01 8:55:38 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> Actually its  simple.<br>

Heh.  I certainly agree that most likely I'll be mulched within two steps.  Although there's a small chance that I can get through the entrance semi-ok.  I wouldn't be able to repeat though, since likely the xp loss will punt me back to 45.  But largely that's not the point.<br>
<br>
Really, I would prefer to not plan this at all, and start the ball rolling as soon as I'm conveniently ready.  And whatever state fear is in at that time is a coincidence to deal with (hopefully with roleplay).  But I want to avoid undermining the work people have put into organizing and administrating the raid guidelines.  If coincidentally a raid is in effect when I would hit fear, it probably would be dangerous of me to be running around, flailing my arms, huge train on my heels.  Whether or not raid veterans have seen that sight a thousand times before.<br>
<br>
So basically, are there any suggestions as to how to fit in this kind of goal in the raid guidelines?  Do people care if unknown chars zone in randomly during their scheduled turns on the planes?  Does anyone insist that fear is off limits unless you're in on a raid?  Let's discuss. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uselilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Winnower of the Harvest</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 7:57:15 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/selilya/sel_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> The raid hosts are listed for the next two weeks.  You'd have to coordinate something like this with them.  Not coordinating could likely ruin the Fear experience for 30 to 42 folks who have made diligent preparation to be there.<br>
<br>
As an avid RP'er, and an Officer in an evil RP guild, we would never intentionally ruin the experience of those not involved in our particular storyline.  Folks respect our right to roleplay...heck...our attack on Kelethin was pretty good evidence of that.<br>
<br>
There are, perhaps, better times than others to attempt Fear.  After a raid is done, the zone will be clear for some time.  Re-pops are usually 12 or so hours later.  One thing to consider...if you zone in alone and die, getting your corpse back might be a challenge...you'd have to again coordinate with a hosting guild.<br>

Why are you not contacting them in game and working something out rather than come here?  No tthat you are not welcome, of course you are, but if you do not want to inconvenience anyone, why not talk to the folks hosting the raids?  I am sure a reasonable solution can be found.<br>

Yes.  Selilya's words are wise and persuasive.  I might be mistaken in assuming that today's Brell guilds on plane raids would aggressively and perhaps unfairly discourage actions for which they have no responsibility, (ie, 'ruin the experience' of others).  Personally, I've experienced secondhand some of the worst guild politics and gm behaviour this server's ever seen.  But, that was some time ago.<br>
<br>
Reconsidering this, I might be more willing to coordinate with the scheduled raidmasters outside of roleplay.  However, I am still worried about this approach for several reasons that are essentially side issues at the moment.  But the biggest reason I'm worried is that currently my position has no weight in the rules.  I'm essentially at the mercy of the raidmasters, or else I intentionally disrespect their position and do what I want anyway without a care, (except I would care, turning my roleplay excursion into a guilt trip).<br>
<br>
If there is room in the plane raid scheduling guidelines that can cover non-raid uses of fear, I would then know how to make it work before having to cooperate with or negotiate with anyone else for plane privilege.<br>
<br>
For example, Selilya suggested the possibility of timing such non-raid uses to occur only after the scheduled raid was complete.  As I understand fear raids, this would mean timing for early-to-mid morning in general.  If that's workable as a rule for the raiding parties I can accept that, though personally I know it's far too inconvenient for me to take advantage of in my case.  Still if that's something I can get then I'd be pleased with having something to try to work with.<br>
<br>
Still, there can be a lot to keep in mind for making such rules.  What if I not only survive my initial entry into Fear, but manage to pull off a major upset and kill some epic spawn (in the flow of roleplay)?  That spawn may then not be available for the next raid.  I'm sure some people may not be too happy with that, and I doubt they'd be eager to simply roleplay out their displeasure.<br>
<br>
I find it fairly unfortunate that EQ is stacked against roleplay in the first place.  I mean, mobs that can flee through walls before you can say 'I have you cornered now, vile orc'?  Bard npcs that can't sing a lick?  No levitation in the Plane of Air (is Noble Dojorn afraid of heights or what)?  I certainly concede that in order to do anything meaningfully epic in EQ one has to largely abandon roleplay and come down to the basic raid gameplay.  I've managed to sneak in a lot of my style of roleplay but at the higher levels its getting hard.  I'm just hoping that there is some room I can work with to both get my enjoyment out of the game without interfering with that of others.<br>
<br>
With that said, I can return to practical tactics for a moment.  I certainly have on my mind how tough corpse retrieval would be in my plans.  I'm well aware how likely it is that should I die, my corpse would decay and I'd lose whatever equipment was on it.  In terms of roleplay I would accept that, (as would any travelling mercenary who might happen to join up with me).  I may yet decide that it makes roleplay sense to equip my normal gear (decent Ro/Kunark stuff) for the raid, even if it all decays.  Be assured that I'm trying to be as diligent in my roleplay preparations as the scheduled raid leaders are being in their raid plans.  <br>
<br>
After all, we all have the same goal to get the most out of the plane experience as possible.  I just have a different approach today, and to be honest I'm looking forward to see what happens with it.<br>
<br>

I don't roleplay, but i'd be into that!  I'm apprehensive from going to Growth as it is!<br>
<br>
Nojo:  Best thing to do, IMO..  Wait until a raid is over.  Run in, frolic around.  Pray a random MoB wasnt killed at an odd time, and doesn't randomly spawn on you.<br>
<br>
A typical American based raid will probably end somewhere around 2-4am EST.  <br>
<br>
Also, take into consideration alot of raids dont pull the temple (the location of the only way out), so it will be full of Amygdalan Knights, who will Harm Touch you into next week.  (i think they HT, blah)<br>
<br>
I understand your doing this for Roleplaying reasons, and I have no disrespect for people that Roleplay (in fact, i find it really cool) but I just want to point out..  If you die, your Fooked.  Plan on walking around nekkid unless theres a cleric there to rez you, or you have enough XP to zone back in (but just to die again).  <br>

But this, this is beyond my imagination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nojo>Nojo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/30/01 8:19:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> Heh, I guess I can talk a bit more about where my character's coming from.<br>
<br>
Why would I want to roleplay a suicide?  That's not really an easy question to answer, even if I have a good reason.  I have reasons, but I wouldn't know how good they are.<br>
<br>
First, though, I don't really consider it suicide when the character will just respawn back at the bind point.  That's just an inescapable roleplay-non-sequitur.  All I'm potentially risking is what equipment I bring with me, and even if I do lose quest armor, it gives me a hook for future campaigning with my character.<br>
<br>
Yes, it does seem obvious that the character will not survive the encounter.  But, in terms of roleplay, no puny mortal born of common Norrathian lineage who enters &quot;The Plane of Fear&quot; (cue ominous thunder) should expect to survive this experience, and furthermore they should only expect to go insane from the terror upon zone-in.  Wouldn't you agree that an Erudite standing next to Cazic-Thule is just a bit overmatched?  From this perspective, every character on every fear raid every day is thus suicidal.  I don't think this is too unimaginable.<br>
<br>
From my character's perspective, he is somewhat motivated to confront his own worst fears, (there is a significant history behind this, but it's not important here for now).  Currently, it's an easy assumption for him to make that to do so, he must confront the lord of fear, Cazic-Thule himself.  This was never an option to him before (due to the level-46 entry limitation), but it has become more glaringly obvious over the last few weeks (real time, months in Norrath time) as the character surges through the twilight of 45.  <br>
<br>
From my perspective, I remember reading a report of a player a long time ago.  The report detailed an amazing roleplay battle between the gm-controlled daughter of an evil god, (I forget which) and a player-controlled virtuous character.  I don't recall much of the details of the battle, but it was hard fought, going over several zones and multiple days.  The evil character would suggest duelling rules and then break them, and in the end the player prevailed by nobly removing all armor and weapons and intentionally making himself vulnerable in the best tradition of his own religion.  If she were to strike him down, his god would win from his noble sacrifice.  If she were not to strike him down, her father would punish her for failing to perform in the tradition of his religion.  Or something like that.  It was an amazing read and I took from that that there's a lot more potential in EQ play than just to loot uber weapons off the corpse of Cazic-Thule.  But, that was a long time ago.<br>
<br>
I've also recently reread the list of god descriptions and suggested roles to play when following the various gods.  It's interesting reading and it has reminded me of various roleplay obligations my characters have.  (How can followers of Innoruuk and Karana manage to group together in Kedge Keep?  It boggles the character's mind.)<br>
<br>
Objectively, it's hard to believe that I'd pull off anything like that, but it's probably worth a try just to see what might happen.  If other people are interested in seeing what might happen, I'm not opposed to them coming, but I have no guild, and as such I won't be doing much of that kind of organizing.  This is about roleplay more than gameplay, (I hope). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhethral.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hethral</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/r Where's the corpse.</span><br>  Posts: 1269<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/30/01 4:45:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://the.truthbringers.com/Images/Members/HeadShots/HethralHead2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> Nojo, talk to a raid leader who's raid is starting a lil later than you get home. Log on, zone in, run like mad and see how many things you can pull / get killed by at once. Everything paths back, the raid starts, and either once they get to you or once the raids over you get your body back. You get to play in a fully popped fear and noone gets put out.<br>

I'm sure most leaders wouldn't mind you going in _before_ they start, just so long as things have time to wander back you won't be disturbing them any.

The GMs have been controlling mobs there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nojo>Nojo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/1/01 6:40:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Hmmm...  I wonder...<br>
<br>
It probably wouldn't hurt to talk with a gm to see if he wants to roleplay some in fear.  If handled right, a fear raid with one or more gm-controlled gods or other npcs might be amazing.  Since Cazic-Thule is allied with Innoruuk, and Inny was responsible for the poisoning of NK, (as Karana is his enemy), there might be some room for gms to get involved in fear.<br>
<br>
It's likely not going to happen, but it wouldn't hurt to ask. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uselilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Winnower of the Harvest</span><br>  Posts: 353<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/1/01 12:14:22 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/selilya/sel_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No room for roleplay?</span><hr size=1> Another thing that many of us RPers do, is write about the things we'd like to do...maybe not necessarily do them per se.  Check out the VN-Brell Boards where we RP types post the stories we write.  I know last year, there were elaborate story lines weaved there...supplemented by in-game sessions.  Maybe it's time to start that back up!<br>
