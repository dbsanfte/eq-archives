<br>
Back then, many of the board users came together, from both sides of the issues and realized that a compromise needed to be made. The issue isn't black and white. <br>
<br>
For those of you who are unaware of what the issues associated with the Fire Giants being made reservable, here they are.<br>
<br>
* Fire Giants are a good learning ground for younger players (sub level 50 mostly).<br>
* Fire Giants have a relatively quick re-spawn time for large mobs.<br>
* Fire Giants have relatively decent loot for sub 50 and over 50 players.<br>
<br>
However<br>
<br>
* Fire Giants block the entry to Ragefire, which is a FCFS non reservable mob on Brell for the cleric epic quest.<br>
<br>
The problem: People on this board are reserving Fire Giants, not for any of the above reasons, but only to block access from others to Ragefire, which again is a non reservable mob.<br>
<br>
Several guilds have indicated that they will no longer observe fFire Giant reservations unless a compromise is made. <br>
<br>
Here is the compromise we are making.<br>
<br>
We are asking everyone who uses this board and calendar to respect Fire Giant reservations. 90% of the time when Fire Giants are up, Ragefire is not up. The 10% (or less) of the time when Ragefire is up, we are asking Fire Giant crews to respect Ragefire Raiders. But because people have abused the system, signing up for Fire Giants when all they really want to kill is Ragefire, our only choice is to say that Fire Giants are FCFS *while* Ragefire is up. That should only end up to be about 2 - 4 times per week on Brell. The remaining 28-30 spawns of Fire Giants should be allowed to be conducted as scheduled on the board.<br>
<br>
So, a quick review.<br>
<br>
1. We are asking people *not* to reserve Fire Giants simply because they want a crack at Ragefire. We will delete posts in the FG reservations forum which indicate people are reserving Ragefire.<br>
<br>
2. We are asking that the users of the board accept that Fire Giants are FCFS *while* Ragefire is up. People who need to get to Ragefire, which is a non reservable mob can't if they can't kill the FGs which lead to him.<br>
<br>
3. We are asking that the users of this board work with Fire Giant raiders to come up with acceptable solutions if there is conflict, and for Ragefire raiders to respect FG schedules when Ragefire is *not* up.<br>
<br>
This is a difficult issue that was handed to the mods with the outcome of this Fire Giant vote. The only way for FGs to be reserved is if everyone works together and compromises a little bit.<br>
<br>
This is the best we could come up with. I am sure people will be unhappy, but it is a compromise we think has beneficial elements to everyone involved.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys<br>

The solution has been handed down by the board moderators, that rage is FCFS, and I can live with that, but want to get something in the open.  What are the rules to FCFS?  <br>
<br>
Can someone please list the OFFICIAL rules, not what you think them to be.  The reason is, according to what I have heard on these same boards, the ONLY thing Verant will support is if you are engaged with a mob, and someone else attacks it, then that is Ksing, and actionable by a GM.  No other rules exist per Verant.  So, does FCFS mean the person with a monk FD’ed at Ragefire’s location owns him?  If 2 monks are there, who wins?  Does it mean the first group in Sol B that /ooc’s they have rage owns him?  If that is the case, can that group wait 6 more hours for others to gather in re-enforcement?  Does it mean the first cleric to actually hand in the stuff to spawn ragefire owns him?  If this is the case, can a cleric hand in the part, get killed by the re-spawned human ragefire, and then start gathering a group, because they triggered the spawn?  Does this mean that 12 groups all attack, representing 3 clerics, and the group with a cleric that loots wins?<br>
<br>
I guess I am just a paranoid @#%$, but in about 30 seconds time, I have come up with maybe 8 ugly scenarios.  Since the board moderators obviously have a vision ™, I invite them to share that vision here, please.  I want to know AHEAD of time, what is the resolution to the above issues.  Because they WILL arise, trust me.  What are the rules, what is the expected, these need to be posted, or else the @#%$ is gonna hit the fan, because there are at least 20 clerics that want/need their epic, and that puts someone about three quarters of a year away from getting their epic.  I don’t have enough trust in human nature to believe that all 20 of those souls are willing to sit still and take that condition.  So who lets greed win, and stretches the situation to their advantage?<br>

The mods have done everything in their powers to appease the masses...and come to some logical stance.  It is, however, up to the community at large, to implement or to ignore.  I would hope that reason prevail.  There is absolutely NO NEED for ugliness...even if disputes do happen.  <br>

<br>
I'm sorry, nobody 'owns' a spawn.  If you're killing it, then you own it.<br>
<br>
If you're killing time by waiting to see if ragefire spawns, then that's your choice.  If you can sit an entire raid in naggies room, then that's your choice.  <br>
<br>
Any other 'rules' are just player made conventions in order to get along better.  Any idea of 'owning' a spawn just because you are feigned in the area is silly.  Any idea of 'owning' a spawn just because you have been sitting there for hours on end is equally silly.  If you can get your raid there first, then you got it.  If you want to camp ragefire, work it our with everyone else that's around you.  I don't think that this will ruin the brell sense of community anymore so than it is already ruined.  Infact it will work better as you will be forced to compromise with people and discuss with them and reach an agreement. <br>
<br>
You won't walk into an area and say sec 8 of the brell camping bylaws say that this spawn is mine because it's tuesady and I'm wearing a green hat.  If somebody is already camping ragefire, you can work it out with that person.  you could say something like.  I can easily get 15 people here in a few minutes of rage spawning.  and the other camper says I can get 15 more in a few minutes of rage spawning.  So then you both decide to work together and to /rand off rage between the two of you at the appropriate time.  That way at least the two of you will be garaunteed of getting rage, rather than the mysterious uber who whisks in 20 minutes after rage spawns when the two of you are still looking for 10 more people for you own separate raid crews. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Board Administrator </font><br><font color=#A0B0E0>Burn the Witch! </font></span><br>  Posts: 2065<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/6/01 11:49:59 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/ladun.jpg width=67 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fire Giants Rules Change - READ</span><hr size=1> Belchere, there are no set of rules for FCFS for this any more than there is a set of FCFS rules for say Severilious, or Lodizal.<br>
<br>
FCFS basically means the first person to have a group ready to kill something will engage said mob.  Everything apart from that has to be dealt with in game, without enforcement by mods.<br>
<br>
As mods, we're here to help make things a little easier for the people on Brell.  We're not here as a police force.  We can make changes to how we do the reservations on the board, but it's up to the people in game to walk it out.<br>
<br>
A polite person, upon seeing ragefire is up, &amp; a cleric is there bringing his friends in for the kill will contratulate the cleric and move on.  Someone else might try to squeeze his group in there first.<br>
<br>
How situations like that play out is for the people to work out in game.  Like a few of the skimishes that have popped up over Korelek Dar, and Lodizal, they will happen, but they won't be the norm. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthorondar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorondar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tunare's Fury</span><br>  Posts: 587<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/6/01 12:20:21 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.watchers-brell.com/images/thor-shirt.jpg height=177 width=162></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   FCFS</span><hr size=1> Get your raid crew there first and the spawn is yours.

I will now take stuff out of the bank again. Although I understand some of bel's concerns. At least the fg/ragefire reserve loop is gone. So to be clear the first to hand in their perl or is it the first to get to spawn area or the first to get to the spawn hand in perl and have the right amount of force. I hope we work together. <br>
Hope is a mighty thing <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukulanaesoulsease.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kulanae Soulsease</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 463<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/6/01 12:50:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.wwa.com/~danas/Kulanae5.gif height=158 width=119></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fire Giants Rules Change - READ</span><hr size=1> A <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> BIG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thank you to Dels and the other Mod's here.

I retired just before the (latest) debate began on this board regarding FG's and Ragefire. Although retired, I read the thread faithfully because I felt it was one of the best threads this board has produced. <br>
<br>
Yes, there are those who said that they would do whatever they want. However, there were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> a lot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of people who voiced their opinion that something really needed to be done. It was a great discussion on the problem and the solutions set forth were done so very well.<br>
<br>
I think that to write it off as being done for &quot;a select few&quot; is to ignore most of what was said.<br>
