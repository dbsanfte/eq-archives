I know it seems logical to &quot;compare&quot; the abilities of various classes in order to balance them. However, some people are far too obsessed with the assumption that improvements to one class must always be matched or offset by similar improvements to a sister class, otherwise it has to be an indirect nerf.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I hope my original post didn't imply that every time we make a change to address class balance that we intend to give something new to all classes. That wouldn't make much sense, as it would contribute to a constant increase in all classes power, and wouldn't necessarily address the balance issue that caused the original change.  If a particular class is lacking in some critical area, than it makes sense to do something to address that class and not all of the others.<br>
<br>
There will certainly be parts of class balancing that change the relative power of one class when compared to another.   Class balancing happens because a given class is underpowered or overpowered when compared to where we feel they should be.  This obviously will change relative power as we improve a weaker class and leave the others where they should be.  <br>
<br>
Also, class balance isn't always dictated by comparing different classes.  A large part of getting the balance right is looking at a class individually.  Does the class provide reasonable value to a group?  Does the class adequately fill a number of roles?  Does the class have sufficient power to deal with the situations we expect them to face?  These questions are as important to getting the balance right as the more common concerns that class A is &quot;better&quot; than class B.<br>

I don't envy VI. What we refer to simply as &quot;caster balancing&quot; is a heck of a lot more complex than it appears on the surface. But I sincerely hope VI's developers won't allow themselves to be too heavily influenced by complaints made by the three caster classes who are already the most desirable casters for raiding.<br>

Honestly, the dev team tries to be objective about all of the feedback we get.  There are some excellent ideas we see from players every day, and there are just as many ideas that sound like good changes but would make EverQuest much less fun to play in the long run.  We try to seek out and listen to many sources of information, but when it comes to making a change we go with what we think is best for the game, understanding that it will make some people unhappy.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure it's possible to make a change that *every* player will love.  Changes that seem entirely favorable to most people always seem to make someone sad.  We'd love to have changes go in and know that every player will love them, but with our huge and diverse player base, there's just no way to please everyone with a given change.  As an example, we recently improved pets for mages and necromancers.  I was surprised to see at least one player post that he was angry that his pet was better because now it was harder to outdamage it.  <br>
<br>
So, the point is - we're working to make EverQuest the best game it can be, and we want players to have a fun and rewarding time, no matter what class they choose to play.  We weigh the feedback we get from different groups carefully, but in the end we're going to make the best decision we can for the game as a whole, knowing that it won't be the change some players hoped for.<br>
<br>
Thanks for playing,<br>

Your post best conveys my exact sentiments !<br>
<br>
As for a **specific** Class Defining Raid role ... the only thing that has crossed my mind over and over would be some sort of Anti-Summoning Spell. This spell would NOT be cast on the MOB rather on a player. That way we can keep the Enchanter alive when he/she tashes or the Shaman alive when he/she slows.<br>
<br>
The spell would not pull aggro from the Main Tank because it would be cast on a PLAYER not a MOB. It would have to be very short term, something along the lines of 10 to 12 seconds and have a recast time of 1 minute. That way a Raid would need 2 to 3 Druids at a raid to keep your 'chanter, Shammy and/or Cleric alive because we could not cast this &quot;buff&quot; on more then one target per MOB encounter. Or the recast time could be as low as the duration of the buff ( ie 10 to 12 seconds ) but that would allow someone to be completely immune to summon for the whole fight because we could chain cast it.<br>
<br>
Of course, just because the MOB can not summon the 'chanter/shaman/cleric does not mean that they would be completely safe. The MOB could always just run after them, but at least if done right, the 'chanter/shaman/cleric might have enough room to back away and hope the Tanks can regain aggro before he/she gets pummeled to death once the MOB reaches them.<br>
<br>
Another way a MOB could reach out and touch someone who has an anti-summon buff on would be a well placed AoE spell in the direction of the 'chanter/shaman/cleric which of course would put our little caster huddle in the corner at risk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, maybe it is just me, but the ONLY real beneficial &quot;Class Defining&quot; raid ability left that is not already in the game would be a spell along this line. Also, it does not seem like it would be overpowered or make encounters trivial for the reasons I listed. /shrug<br>
<br>
Oh, and VI before you go ahead and put my idea in the game ( or &quot;our&quot; Idea, in case others too have thought about this and posted the idea before me ), <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  lemme make sure you know that making it drop ONLY off of Emperor Ssraeshza in the Ssraeshza Temple would not be funny <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Lemme suggest Juggs or something along those lines.

OK--that answers what contexts they're using. :D<br>

I'm not afraid to call it like I see it.  Too many me too opinions around here.  If it weren't for peeps like rtfm with counter opinions this would be a dull board.  I say meet this issues that bug you head on.  I sincerely belive MB, CH and Warrior defensive have jerked the balance of the game towards those classes.  And as such, I'm going to say so.<br>
<br>
So many of you say improve my class - don't nerf the other.  Well, those mistakes are so large that there is no way that VI throw a mistake after another mistake and as such our class will always be behind the power curve.  Ignoring and whispering away the mistakes is like going along with the crowd  -- the Emperor has no clothes.<br>

<br>
Mana burn. It isn't very mana efficient and is only overpowered in regards to kunark dragons. That is just a tiny fraction of mobs in the game and they can and probably will fix it in the future.<br>
<br>
CH. Well duh. Of course it is overpowered. But it has also been in the game forever and much of the high end content is based on the fact that CH is in the game. Nerfing CH in any way at this point would require adjusting every high end encounter in the game from Nagy on up and would cause just way too many problems. It isn't worth the pain it would cause to try and mess with CH.<br>
<br>
Calling for nerfs on these other than maybe mb vs kunark dragons is a waste of time and can basically be chalked up as whining. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>
