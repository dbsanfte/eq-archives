Her hair had matted during her prolonged illness and she spent a few hours each day separating the mats.  Sister Semmeline wanted her to cut it, but she would not.  Her hair had been her pride and joy, the blackness of it offsetting her ivory complexion, now almost translucent.  <br>
<br>
She was gaining strength daily and soon she would begin her first walks.  She was looking forward to getting out of the bedroom with its stale smell of sickness.  She wanted to see her daughter.  It had been over a week since she'd seen Caedusia and it seemed every day Taman had a different excuse.  She worried he was running that girl ragged.<br>
<br>
Sister Semmeline knocked on the door.   &quot;Come in,&quot; Esmira answered.  <br>
<br>
Semmeline carried in a tray of broth and some fresh warm bread.   &quot;My, look at you.  I wouldna  believed you could turn that mass into proper hair agin, but I do say that I think you  may succeed afterall.  Now, I've brought you some lunch.  Eat up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where's Taman?&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh, he's returned to his shop, he has.  There's a more'n a wee bit of dustin' and mendin' before he'll be ready to ply his trade but I think he's itchin' to get back at it now.  Left the minute I walked in the door.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Did he take Caedusia with him, then?&quot; Emsira asked.<br>
<br>
The smile on Sister Semmeline dropped a moment before she caught herself and resumed her jovial bedside manner.  &quot;Nay, an he did not.&quot;  she produced a pale imitation of a  smile.  &quot;Now, no more talkin'.  You need to eat up if you're going to restore your strength.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Esmira dunked the warm bread into the hot broth and ate a bit.  She then drank the rest of the broth and ate another wee bite of bread.  Her appetite had not fully returned and try as she might, she could not get much food in her.  But today she'd eaten more than yesterday and with the improvement as steady as it was, the question had turned to one of when she would return to full health, rather than if.  There was no remnant of the infection that had ravaged her body and the healers saw no damage at all.  In fact, the bent finger she'd broken as a child playing stones with her brothers had mended straight.  It was proof of the miracle of Rodcet Nife.  <br>
<br>
Esmira allowed herself to sink back into the bed for an afternoon nap and Semmeline tidied up the room a bit, opened the window for some fresh air, and took the tray.  As Esmira slept a north wind blew in and the cool crisp breezes dancing on her face woke her.  The horizon was darkening and long shadows cast themselves across her bed.  She heard loud voices in the ante-room.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You can't avoid this any longer, Taman Talisman.  You've got to tell the woman. She's been asking after her daughter every day now.  How long do you think you can keep it a secret.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll not be disturbin' her 'til she be healthy.  She no need t' know.  It be enough that she's well and growin' stronger.&quot;  Taman took off a heavy boot off and threw it clanking against the front door.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'd have thought losing that lass woulda mended you of your stubborn ways, but I see I be wrong.  Well I'll tell you this, Taman.  Either you tell her tonight, or I'll tell her tomorrow.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Taman threw his other boot across the room.  &quot;'Tis no wonder ya never married, Semmeline.  You've as tart a tongue in your mouth as a Viccar.  You'll not be tellin' me what to do in me own home.  And I won't be needin' your nursin' no more so don't bother t' come back.  I won't be lettin' you in.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Sister Semmline stood her full height and looked down on the sitting Taman.  &quot;We'll see what the church says about that!.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmira waited in bed until she heard the door slam shut and then called to Taman.  Taman entered and winced at the fire in Esmira's eyes and the red flush to her cheeks.  &quot;Where is Caedusia?&quot;<br>
<br>
Taman shuffled his feet a bit.  &quot;I sent her off to run an errand.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know ye won't lie t'me Taman, but I also know ye don't always be tellin the entire truth.  I want to know where she is and what errand she be runnin'?   Whatever t'is, if ye don't tell me I understand Semmeline will an' you can't keep me in this bed much longer.  I'm stronger by the day and I'll walk to the church meself to find the truth.&quot;  Esmira pulled the bed sheets back and swung her legs over the edge of the bed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye'll do nothin' of the kind.  There's no need to have ye out catching yer death just come from his door less'n a week ago.&quot;  Taman said as he closed the window to keep the cold air out of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then ye'll answer me, or by Karana I'll bring the god's curses upon ye, so help me I will.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ye'll curse me for keepin' silent or curse me for doin' what had to be done.  Makes no difference to me.&quot;  Taman answered.<br>
<br>
Esmira fell back on the pillows, exhausted.  Her strength was coming too slowly for her liking and it took every ounce to argue with Taman once he'd dug in his heels.   Taman lifted her up and set her gently back down on the bed, pulling the covers over her. <br>
Esmira closed her eyes and breathed deeply.  Taman started to slink out of the room to allow his wife to sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;You'll not be gettin' off the hook, husband.  Ye know the truth can't be worse than me imagination.&quot;  Esmira coughed a dry hacking cough.<br>
<br>
Taman fetched her some water and sat next to her on the bed as she drank it.  &quot;Ye shouldna be exertin' yerself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye shouldna be givin' me reason.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tears came to Taman's eyes as he took Esmira's hand and began his confession.  &quot;Ye were dyin', Es, an' I couldna' live without ye.  I couldna'.   So when the sister offered a miracle, what choice did I have but to take it.  An' the child wanted to go, Es, she wanted to do it fer her mother.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Esmira kept her eyes closed and continued to breath long deep breaths.  &quot;Ye gave the child to the sisters?&quot;  she whispered.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.  And Rodcet Nife gave ye back yer life.  'Twas a fair bargain.&quot;<br>
<br>
Opening her eyes she looked on Taman with pity.  &quot;A child is not a cow, Taman Talisman, to be bartered and sold.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A life for a life, Esmira.  It's the way.&quot;  Taman said sternly.<br>
<br>
&quot;But 'twas not yer life to give.  'Twas not yer choice to make.&quot;  Esmira pushed herself up and sat against the pillows.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Me wife and me daughter, an' who's choice should it be then if not me own?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You could ha' asked me.  Ye coulda!&quot;  Esmira shouted as anger fueled her and gave her strength.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye wouldna' said yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, an' knowin' that ye did it anyway.  Leave me, Taman.  Leave me be.&quot;  Esmira sighed and closed her eyes again.<br>
<br>
Taman paused at the door on the way out.  &quot;Ye'll feel better about it when ye'r strength is returned.  We'll have more, Es, the sisters said yer womb'll be whole an' we'll have more.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmira rolled her back to Taman in answer.  He closed the door quietly and left.  <br>

You almost make me pity the poor man.  I would not have done what he did but you can make me feel like he did when he gave up his daughter to keep his wife.  And that is hard to do as it is oposite of what I would have done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That makes it one well writen story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
