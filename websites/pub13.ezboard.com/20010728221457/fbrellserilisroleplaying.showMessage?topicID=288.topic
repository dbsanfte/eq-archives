I wrote this after participating in the 1999 Halloween GM event that has come to be known as Bloody Kithicor.  This is an actual account of the events that occurred that night on Brell Serilis.

* * * * * <br>
<br>
I awoke in the East Commons to the sound of a great commotion. People were running about in a mad rush, shouting about the invasion. Light dwellers of all sorts were asking, pleading for people to come aid in the battle at Highhold Pass. It had begun. The Teir'Dal were on the move. <br>
<br>
It was common knowledge throughout all of Norrath that the Teir'Dal were planning an assault on Highhold Pass. Not long ago, a small band of dark elves attempted a raid on the Pass, only to be struck down by the forces of Good, lead by Felinin Deepwood. Felinin found a note on the body of one of the dark elves, which told of an upcoming assault on Highhold Pass by a force of over 200 Teir'Dal. This was the foretold invasion. <br>
<br>
Naturally, I hurried to Highhold Pass as quickly as my feet would carry me. All of the Commons was in disarray. As I hurried, I heard people talk of the massive dark elf army which was attacking, and it sounded as if things were not good for Highhold Pass. From what I could gather, the Pass was beyond hope, as it was already taken over. Many were also talking that the Teir'Dal were moving towards Rivervale! This worried me much, for if they managed to take over both Highhold Pass and Rivervale, the dark elves would control all trade and travel for nearly all of Norrath. As I entered the Kithicor Woods I came across Nurina, and together we headed for Rivervale in an attempt to protect the hobbits from this evil. <br>
<br>
Nurina and I hurried as fast as we could. We were about halfway to Rivervale, when I saw a sight off of the path a little ways and stopped. I did not have a chance to tell Nurina, though, and she continued down the path. What I saw was this: Lanys T`Vyl and Laarthik K'Shin standing together! Quite naturally I was curious, and approached them. There was another, a human, standing there with them (I cannot recall her name), who appeared to be trying to talk to the two dark elves, but was so afraid she could not hardly form the words to speak. Lanys was throwing insults at the poor human, and I could not let it go on any further. I approached Lanys, the Daughter of Innoruuk, and said, &quot;Silence, dark one. You and your army shall fall soon enough.&quot; <br>
<br>
Lanys had not seen me standing there, and quickly looked around to see where this voice came from. When she saw me, our eyes met and I felt a terrible chill overcome me. Never before had I encountered such an evil creature before in my life! Yet I knew that I could not stand down from her. I would defend Tunare in all her glory, regardless of the cost. At first Lanys thought little of me, and simply scowled. &quot;Tunare watches over all the lightbringers this day,&quot; I said. <br>
<br>
She then asked me, &quot;Do you seek to destroy me?&quot; She laughed, a sound which brought much pain to my ears. <br>
<br>
&quot;I alone will not destroy you,&quot; I told the wretched Teir'Dal, &quot;but together the forces of Light will prevail.&quot; <br>
<br>
I could tell my words were stirring up much anger and hatred inside Lanys. Not many dared speak out against her. She then said, &quot;You will receive the glory and honor of dying in the name of my father Innoruuk, infidel! The lightdwellers have no chance! My fathers' hatred will overcome you all.&quot; <br>
<br>
I could only laugh at this statement. &quot;Ha! Glory and honor are two words that Innoruuk knows little of. Your fathers' hatred will be the end of you.&quot; <br>
<br>
By now a large crowd had gathered around us, including Gaelwyn and Dolfina. It was good to have them standing by my side. Although I remained as steadfast as I could, inside I felt a wave of fear which I had never felt before. I greeted them both and said, &quot;As you can see, we have stumbled across some of the most powerful evil here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Silence!&quot; shouted Lanys. &quot;You shall receive the payment of your blood spilling across my blade!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Your scare tactics will not stop the powers of Light,&quot; I replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;I do not attempt to put fear in your heart,&quot; stated Lanys, &quot;that is the will of Cazic Thule and he is no match for my Father.&quot; <br>
<br>
More and more travellers stopped along the path to listen to the words being exchanged between Lanys and I. Some had just come from Rivervale, and the word they brought was that the dark elf invasion on Rivervale had been stopped. Gaelwyn said to Lanys, &quot;I hear that Rivervale has been swept clean. You are ended here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Rivervale will fall and so will High Keep. It is the will of Innoruuk. He speaks through me and I am of his blood.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her words angered me so. I knew that Tunare was watching over us, and she would never allow the Teir'Dal to take over Rivervale. I looked Lanys in the eyes, feeling her cold stare upon me, and told her, &quot;Your blood will pour upon this land! You can be sure of this.&quot; <br>
<br>
Suddenly a great sickness overcame me. I staggered backwards and gasped for air, but I could not find any air to breathe. An evil grin slowly came across the lips of Lanys, and I then realized she was attacking! Quickly I tried to regain my concentration and ask Tunare for protection, but before I could do so, the wench was upon me, landing blow after crushing blow. I was no match for the Daughter of Innoruuk and fell quickly. The onlookers were shocked by her sudden violent outbreak, and they quickly converged upon her in attempt to destroy her. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, Tunare was watching over all the forces of good that day, and she spared my life along with many others. I hurried back to the place of battle, only to discover that Dolfina had also fallen, not long after I. It was easy to tell where the battle was occuring, though. Never before had I seen such a force in my life! There must have been at least fifty or more lightdwellers battling against Lanys and Laarthik. Bodies lay as far as the eye could see, and more were falling quickly. I did what I could to heal those in need, but my attempts seemed nearly futile. Even an army as massive as this was not able to stop Lanys! I thought all hope was lost, but soon appeared Firiona Vie herself! She quickly began to heal all those in need, trying to keep our forces alive. But even this was not enough; we could not take down the Daughter of Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
The battle raged on for some time yet, and we fought valiently, but our efforts were not enough. Morale was running low, and many began to run off. However, just then an iron-clad figure walked up the path. It was none other than Lord Tephys! We all began asking him what we needed to do in order to combat this evil. He said little, though, and walked towards Lanys, blade swinging. <br>
<br>
What a battle indeed! Lord Tephys and Lanys T`Vyl were fighting each other, and not far away Galeth Veredeth and Laarthik K'Shin were also battling. Such an incredible fight! Lord Tephys and Lanys exchanged blow after blow, yet neither seemed to be gaining advantage over the other. We all did what we could to aid Lord Tephys, and in fact for awhile we believed he was on the winning edge. <br>
<br>
However, Lanys decided she would not be so easily defeated. &quot;I call upon Innoruuk! My Father!&quot; she shouted at the top of her voice, and appeared a manifistation of Hate himself! Many scattered at the sight of Hate, while others stood strong to defend Lord Tephys in this battle. Lanys only smiled throught, though, as if she knew something we didn't. And in fact she did. Again she yelled, saying, &quot;Father Innoruuk! I call upon your hate to strike down Tephys!&quot; Suddenly Lord Tephys was struck by a column of fire, and his lifeless body fell to the ground. <br>
<br>
Lord Tephys had fallen. <br>
<br>
Our forces quickly began to scatter. It was almost as if she had been playing with Lord Tephys the whole time, and then decided to end it. With the power of Innoruuk on her side, Lanys was a powerful foe indeed. There was only one person left who would be able to combat this evil. &quot;Father Innoruuk!&quot; shouted Lanys. &quot;I ask you to bring Firiona to me!&quot; <br>
<br>
And she came. Another relentless battle pursued, one of such intensity that had never been seen in all the land. Here stood the Daugher of Innoruuk and Tunare's finest paladin, in a battle for power and survival. &quot;Children of Innoruuk! Destroy Firiona!&quot; shouted Lanys, in an effort to rally support. She knew that this battle would not be as easy as hers against Lord Tephys. <br>
<br>
&quot;By the power of Tunare, and the will of the gods, you shall not succeed Lanys!&quot; retaliated Firiona, while continuing her relentless attack. Tension filled the air as the leaders of opposing forces met, face to face in the forest. Clouds filled the sky and thunder rumbled. The very earth vibrated in response to the gods' impatience. Balance had to be restored. <br>
<br>
The battle raged on, all the time Hate watching over his Daughter. A deep, throaty laugh emanated from the bowels of the world as if rejoicing. Innoruuk was pleased. Highhold Pass was now completely under the control of the Teir'Dal. Lanys struck down Lord Tephys, and was now engaged in the most important battle yet. Tunare, however, refused to sit idle while such darkness overcame the land. The earth trembled and it's creatures were silenced as the Mother's power grew. The world perched precariously on the edge of a great cataclysm. Galeth still contiuned his battle against Laarthik, even after the fall of Lord Tephys, in order to help the lightdwellers. He felt the surge of strength from Tunare, and shouted, &quot;Your attempt to gain ascendance is futile, Lanys! Even the power of Innoruuk is not sufficient to overcome the strength of perfect Balance!&quot; The sounds of battle filled the air. The flow of the air and the fish of the sea awaited its outcome, knowing that Balance had be restored. <br>
<br>
The body which occupied Laarthik's evil soul was young and strong, and he bore down upon the ancient Galeth, despite the paladin's centuries of experience. Things did not look well for Galeth. His stamina was begging to fade, for this battle lasted longer than any had imagined. Grumbling from beneath the world announced Innoruuk's impatience. Not far from these two, Lanys's skin took on a sheen of brilliance as she was bathed in power. Clouds of tiny insects screamed and spiraled around the battles, trees waved their branches as if in distress, and the earth itself heaved with the Mother's displeasure. <br>
<br>
The battles raged on, the balance teetering ever so slightly in favor of one, and then returning to the other. In fact, one could almost invision the gods themselves battling, for the earth shook with an anger unknown to the land. Firiona's shining hair became a bright beacon as she was cloaked in the Love of the Mother. Tunare's energy surrounded and empowered her. The Chosen of Tunare, seemed to grow in stature as she glowed even more brightly, filled with the power of the Mother. She wailed a wordless battle cry as the ferocity of her attack pushed Lanys back once again. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, Laarthink managed to break free from Galeth. He pulled out a mysterious orb, and held the orb high in the air as it's glow brightened and sperad, a dark core at it's center. In a strangled voice, he screamed, &quot;Innoruuk! I call upon you in the name of Lanys T`Vyl! Attend her!&quot; Shrieking, as if from ten thousand throats, filled the air of Norrath as an immeasurable power created a great rift in an astral barrier. Fear and dread filled the hearts of even the most evil races as a miasma of evil spewed forth from the Plane of Hate. <br>
<br>
Laarthik's borrowed body was encased in a pillar of fire emanating from the orb, as the energies of Innoruuk were unleashed. Lanys tossed her head and laughed throatily as she screamed out in welcome to the power of Innoruuk. Her body glowed with the crimson flame as she was drawn upward by the Prince of Hate, her father. The Child of Hate disappeared into the swirling rift in the sky as Laarthik crmpled to the ground and a tremendous roar rose up from the very heart of Norrath. Firiona Vie stared in dismay and shock as Lanys was swept into the heart of Hate, dread filling her eyes with angry tears. <br>
<br>
Firiona then realized the events which were about to conspire. The Chosen of Tunare called out to those around her as her heart was overcome with fear. &quot;Flee! Flee for your lives! Doom approaches!&quot; Bodies ran this way and that, in attempt to flee the land as quickly as possible. Firiona rushed to Galeth's side and cried, &quot;This is a portent of death! None can survive the Hate Innoruuk will cast upon us!&quot; Fear quickly spread among everyone. Seeing Firiona in such a state was enough to scare off even the most valiant warriors. <br>
<br>
A feeling of emptiness and dread withered the souls of all in Kithicor as something changeed about them, screams of horror and doom filled their ears. The cries of the fallen echoed through Kithicor. It had happened. A portal from the realm of Innoruuk had opened this night in the forest of Kithicor, and he unleashed an army of undead to show his power. Many brave souls gathered in an attempt to combat the new threat, while others simply fled for their lives. Undead ran about, killing all those within sight. <br>
<br>
The battle raged on, and finally many of these new creatures were destroyed. But not at a cost. Many died this night, too many to count. Lord Tephys was also struck down, a death which will be mourned throughout the land. Highhold Pass is under the control of the dark elves, giving them a stronger foothold in the land of Norrath. A portal was opened to the realm of Innoruuk, giving him the ability to send his army of undead to our world. Kithicor was forever tainted after this night. <br>
<br>
Yet not all was lost. Together the forces of good banded together to defend all that is good and just. High Keep did not fall to the dark elves. Rivervale was successfully defended, much to the joy of the halflings. Even Qeynos was saved from an onslaught of undead. Be strong, brother and sisters. The battle is not over. We must keep constant watch, for the powers of Innoruuk are strong. Perhaps we can work and find a weakness, and even one day raid his world. If he can send his army of darkness to our world, surely we can find a way to cross into his, and seek our revenge. Together we stood, and together we shall stand again. <br>
<br>
Praise Tunare. <br>
