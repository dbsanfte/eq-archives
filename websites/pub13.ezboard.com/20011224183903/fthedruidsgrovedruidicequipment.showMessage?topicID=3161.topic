Anyway, trying to get the druid out of 52 and into 53 cause I want Winged Death dammit!<br>
<br>
I have tried quadding raptors several times with some success.  Problem is that I find myself one or two Lightning Blasts short of getting 3 of em down.  I figure If I can get all but one down, I can root and finish with es arms while I med for next round.  If there are two or more left when I go oom, then I have to med-kite enough mana to LB them again.  Takes forever.  So I moved to Spirocs and those are a joke.  I feel guilty taking those from the lower level quadders as the lightfoots are way green now.<br>
<br>
I am at 200wis  with mostly wis/ac gear and am wondering if I am too low a level or do I need to just work on a wis/mana gear set to allow this hunt.  I am thinking of the following changes:<br>
<br>
Dump tattered, get ivy cords<br>
Dump Froggy Crown, get Nightshade wreath<br>
Get Crys belt (need one anyway)<br>
Dump es arms for uthork hide<br>
<br>
by doing that, I would add 16wis so I could also do the following:<br>
<br>
Dump plat jasper rings, add moonstones<br>
Dump Forest loops, Add Black Sapphire earrings<br>
<br>
That would reduce wis by 18 but add 130mana.<br>
<br>
Net effect:  lose two wis gain 130 mana.<br>
<br>
considering that I seem to have about half a LB when I go OOM, this change may allow one more blast.  <br>
<br>
Should I try this or just wait for 53+?<br>
<br>

I have a partial solution to your problems with raptors.... When you get down to two raptors which are low on health, pick the one with more health and root it.  The second mob will take about 6 steps and stop. Mobs will continue on when in groups but once you break the group up they will try to run.... but HA they are snared.... and he will stand still... after that you can have your way with them....This is not a perfect fix, but it will save you some time....<br>

<br>
just gotto remember to keep your timer on the ensnare.. 10 minutes and oom is not a good feeling :( re-snare at 8 minutes if it looks like you can't finish them off.. and just run/med til you have mana for one last blast.<br>
------<br>
<br>
as for your changes in gear.. the froggy crown is good for dungeons/raids.. so i would just put it in a backpack. braided is also a good upgrade.. and so is the crys belt.<br>
<br>
i wouldn't be so quick about the es arms though.. they are a lifesaver.<br>

Great exp and a lot of the times not too crowded. I tried the raptors at 50 and 51 with some success, but like you, I was a little short usually on the last kill. Wyverns have less hp and give about the same experience, plus they drop several quest gems for the Velious armor (including some Druid gems).<br>
<br>
You can either kite em on the cliff itself or levitate up and pull down on the beach. I usually just run em around on the cliff back and forth just past the large rock in the center of the cliff. Only problem is the Drakes who cast a nasty AoE dispell if you get too close (aggro is huge)so be careful. If you pull to the beach the Othmirs do not care about the Wyverns and you can kite right through em. <br>
<br>
Make sure you avoid the Sirens and Bulthars (sp?) on the beach as well. Sirens are enchanters and they have a nasty charm spell. One time they charmed me as I was running from a Drake and I started nuking 3 or 4 people on the beach hehe. Luckily charm wore off before I killed anyone. All in all this place can take you to 53 easily and maybe pick up some gems too. Best place to med is either at the Tower by the entrance to SS zone, or on the beach in the Othmir camp. I am currently binded right by the Othmir King/Leader and it is safe to med there. Plus, the music has a snazzy beat to it ).<br>

Now first of all, I'll start off by stating that I don't quad-kite at ALL.  I find myself in too many situations where I have to drop what I'm doing to either handle guild business or RL stuff, so I generally root-dot singles or pairs.  But anyway, I went to CS last night, my second time there (lvl 51), with a guildmate (lvl 49 mage).  First time coming out of the portal, the mage gets caught in an AoE from a drake that's on someone else.  What can I say, he's a mage...low HPs and dropped like a rock.  OK, so I gate back and meet him at the nearest ring, and back we go again.  He casts invis on me as I cast the teleport, then on himself.  We land, he heads for his corpse, and of course this time my invis fades.  No big deal, there is nothing in aggro range of me...until a fellow druid quads right on top of us while my partner is looting his corpse (at a &quot;safe&quot; spot).    Well, a drake had joined the quad wyverns, casts AoE on the guy pulling, hits us both.  The puller gets killed, and after having hit me with the AoE, the wyvern is now aggro on me.  I never got a spell off, welcome back to 50, returning to bind point.<br>
<br>
CS is a great zone, but as soon as word got out of its great exp and it developed a reputation as being perfect for druids, it was swamped.  At this point, I'd much rather stick to pulling blues outside Karnors and risking Gorenaire's hatred than dodging other people's drake adds in CS.  Maybe on other servers, or in the middle of the night, it would be better...but the same could be said for a lot of zones.<br>

You are aware that the wyverns can be ensnared up on the cliffs from beach level?  Don't have to bother with levitate, generally in range as long as you are at the cliff/beach border...remember the game largely ignores the Z-axis.  Hence the small number of underwater zones.<br>

Hope it helps,<br>

They forget about the Drakes and wind up training other people. And yes, I do know about snaring from the beach Aluinae :). But everytime I tried that some idiot would have a train of Bulthars and Chests on em and $*#) up my flow.<br>
<br>
And I must say it has gotten quite crowded there now (. Only used to be 5 or 6 people in the whole zone before, now there's 15 20 with most killing the Wyverns. The best time to go is kinda late (11pm or later) on a weeknight. Might still be some people there but not as much and maybe you can quad while the other Druid/person is medding as they spawn fairly quickly. <br>

I had gone there to get the CS tooth long ago. But it was merely a &quot;run-in and gate out&quot; event. So after all the hub-bub about CS I ported in, and thought I would go hunt Wyvrns.<br>
<br>
Misstery, meet Drake...Drake...Meet Misstery.... Please Wait Loading.....<br>

So I had a Necro guildy in SS and he came to drag me to beach. He watched the drake and told me when it was safe to port in. I get in. I loot.. No clerics. forget about rezzes here. hehe. <br>
<br>
I pull a single wyvrn to get a feel for their strength.. Had it rooted and down to about 10% health and it poofed on me !?!?! It was pitch black outside (damn human eyes) so I turned into a wolf. Otters don't like wolves.. Please Wait Loading....Welcome back to level 51... <br>
<br>
Went back to beach. looted body. Was medding up the extra mana from my stat bonuses.... Misstery, meet Ulthar...Ulthar, meet Misstery.... This guy didn't like me one bit... Gated out... <br>
<br>
I might also mention I had a Haunted Chest looking thingy chomp my ass once or twice too. <br>

I think i will stick to soloing in Burning Woods.<br>
