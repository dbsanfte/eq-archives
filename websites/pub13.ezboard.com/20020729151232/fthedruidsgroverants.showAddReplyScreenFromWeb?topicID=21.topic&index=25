My name shows quite obviously that i am not a dark elf. Or would any dark elf have a last name 'Goldenheart'? Somehow i doubt it. Anyways people say things they have never said before when i go around healing and buffing everyone in the low level areas. Not a single time yet for me to say anything negative about the way people treat me.

I can say without a doubt that the females have gotten far more gifts at low levels - Skull of Jen'Tra as a level 1 necro =), bronze armor for level 2 paladin, more plat than I can count, etc.  As a male, the best gift I got was a snakeskin jerkin at level 5 and that's just because someone was trashing his character (quitting EQ) and giving his stuff to whoever happened by.  The female gifts have come from people giving me /tells directly. <BR>  <BR> That being said, my female characters have also had to put up with a lot more abuse than the males.  I routinely get comments about my outfit, appearance, etc.  I never get these on my male characters.  I've even /reported a couple players for very vulgar suggestions made repeatedly.  Didn't do any good, but I felt better for reporting it.

They are so funny at times... <BR> When I started out my half elf ranger in Queynos, at my second level I was given about 20pp by one guy then at my third level turned around and a very nice gentlemen gave me a rattail whip and a jagged band..fortunately my husbands character was a high level, so I sold it and by fifth level had a full set of banded armor! Since then, looking no longer like a newbie, I haven't received that many gifts..but the guys continue to make lewd comments and so forth. I happen to take pride in the way my character looks as I add various better armor peices. Guys, us ladies would rather a comment about what nice silver-plated leggings we have instead of&quot; uh huh, look at that ass&quot; or some other stupid remark!  <BR> Hey, but don't get me wrong I enjoy a nice bout of flirting every once in a while as long as its within it's bounds. Ladies don't deprive yourself of having a good time because of some silly horny 15 yr old! Lastly, if the dumb guys wanna give away their stuff, by all means, LET EM'!I say roleplay the HELL out of them..men on the server so much like in RL like getting used sometimes(not speaking for everyone)so take advantage of it! <BR> Ps..

When I first found out that any armor that I could afford only managed to make me look like I was wearing even LESS I had to wonder. When my husband started saying things like &quot;Niiiiice Pixels&quot; and &quot;Not bad for a fake ass&quot; I had to laugh. It's easy to tell that the designers are mostly men, but at least when I take off my armor I still have something on. Did any of you ever play Daggerfall?

But DANG!! even when I'm with her I get flirted with constantlyand so does she. Now, I'll be the first to admit we give as good as we get, but I've yet to be crude to anyone,,and wouldnt tolerate it from a stranger towards either of my,,umm wives lol. Now both my &quot;damn this is fun&quot; wives have been given lots of stuff from ,,,hell total strangers at times,  And they sometimes even keep it hehe. I shake my head and laugh when Airumeil hands me something to sell, or use. or give away that she got from some guy, just because she was friendly and said hello.  <BR>  <BR> Seems to me, ,,If a female says hello, and you take that to mean,,hey there sailor lets go find a quiet spot and &quot;insert favorite passtime&quot;... umm no pun intended. Then your low on the old maturity scale. And anyone who opens a conversation with a stranger with a  comment like,,&quot;whoa, nice ass baby&quot; is hopeless or very young. <BR>  <BR> So, not all the guys are immature sexual beasties. Ya cant go lumping everyone under one label. Cause the diversity in age and experience is vast in online gaming.. and until you get to know a person,,you really dont know if thier 13 or 30.
