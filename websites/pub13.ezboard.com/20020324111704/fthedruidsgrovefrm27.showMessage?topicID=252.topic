I've been looking for a similar site for DAoC, but have yet to find one... which is why I'm posing this question here:<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how damage is actually calculated?<br>
<br>
I saw an equation the other day that showed a rough estimate of how damage would be calculated, neglecting skill bonuses and item level over on Allakhazam, but I can't seem to find it anymore.<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is this: last night, I started a piercing defensive paladin since my 2-handed pally was busted; had trouble soloing greens at level 8. Obviously, 1-handed piercing weapons tend to be much, much faster than big old 2-handed slashers. However, at level 6, my new pally is using a 3.2 DPS main gauche and is tearing through mobs at a much higher rate than my 2-handed paladin at level 8, using a greatsword of the initiate (3.0 dps -- same mobs). Now, assuming I've distributed the skills in a relatively similar manner across both characters, the only real difference i can find is that my new paladin's weapons are much faster... and now that I think about it, I seem to remember weapon delay playing a factor in that damage equation. I was always under the impression that DPS was the stat by which a weapon was ultimately judged; afterall, it's damage per second: damage/delay, not damage per swing. So a weapon being swing twice as often for half the damage of another would have the exact same DPS.<br>
<br>
Is this true? Does delay play a role in damage? I prefer smaller, faster weapons, anyway, but I'm so in love of the look of a plate-clad female briton carrying a great axe... <p>--For every winner, there are dozens of losers. Odds are you're one of 'em.

I could have done without the fetish revelation, TMI, hehe.<br>
<br>
I'm so totally not a numbers person, I don't even know if this thread will help, but it's a shot. It's about assassins, but maybe there's some info in there that translates for you. My eyes glazed over reading it, hehe. <br>
<br>
I basically find something that cons nice and swing it until someone's dead. Sometimes it's me, usually it's them :-) But I understand some people actually enjoy being efficient, and enjoy figuring out the numbers behind the game. More power to you! <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>

While I can understand some people want actual numbers and statistics so they can be more efficient, I just aim, fire and hope it turns out in my favor.  It's really just a game to me and I don't sit there and bother with, well this mob wears this type of armor so I should do this or this to fight him or carry a bizillion weapons to hit different types of mobs with.  (I'm not saying that you're one of them but I do know several tanks that carries like 8 weapons with them to the point where they're so damn encumbered they can't move without my str buff.)<br>
<br>
Although it being efficient is part of strategy (which is essentially what you need to play DAoC), keep in mind that DAoC is still fairly new and most people don't really know all the jists of it yet.  Even the spoiler sites.  Heck even Sanya gives incorrect stats and info.  (She made some statement about mez time and such and was totally off.)<br>
<br>
Maybe you could get in on the Q&amp;A Grab Bag Sanya has over at Camelot Herald on Fridays.  She might have some answers. <p><CENTER>

<br>
The other caveat is that playing a defensive tanking pally means that I can take an unreal amount of punishment and create such an ungodly amount of aggro that cleric group heals aren't even likely to get the mob off me, all the while contributing to the group's general well-being with my healing chant. The only issue I have is keeping aggro from other tanks (keeping in mind, this is all read... I'm not terribly experienced with the class yet) - namely halberd-wileding, style-happy armsmen... short term, mind you -- mobs seem to have an intense hatred for that regen chant.  ;)  I want to know what type of weapon is going to be most effective at generating enough of a taunt to keep the mob on me ALL the time, without having to ask the casters to hold off nuking or the other tanks to not use so many styles.<br>
<br>
So that's why I want to know damage formulae (or aggro formulae... those would be great, too) -- not so I can run around being a permanant mini-maxed, cookie-cutter character, but simply because I don't understand how damage works now -- unfortunately common-sensical rules don't apply to fantasy settings, and I hate the idea of sitting there being far less effective than I -could- be because I'm ignorant. I just look at it this way: spec levels indicate my physical skill with a weapon, but not the knowledge of how to use that weapon most effectively; that I've gotta learn myself.<br>
<br>
So, I'm not going to be carrying around 20 weapons all the time so I can adapt to every fathomable situation in the most effective way possible; I've committed to piercers and I'm sticking with them -- I like the way they &quot;feel.&quot; I just want to know what role delay plays in the overall dealing of damage and therefore, mob aggro. <p>--For every winner, there are dozens of losers.

<br>
It's funny, I like games so much that I've thought about trying to get into making games instead of sys admin'ing for a living...but I have a feeling that turning what I love into my job would kill the love, you know? Especially since I find myself so uninterested in the actual mechanics of the game, hehe. <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>
