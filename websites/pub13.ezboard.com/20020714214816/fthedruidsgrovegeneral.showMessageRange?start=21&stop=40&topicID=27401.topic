 <br>
  Doubtful unless Clerics get a DL upgrade.  DL is 2.7 hp/mana instant heal, NT is 2.2 hp/mana instant heal.  2k for 600 is 3.3 hp/mana.  What makes druids such crappy healers is a) lack of CH's massive 10 or 20 to 1 or better healing, b) lack of high efficiency low agro but not instant heals (celestial elixir and Torpor.)  For b, yes we have Nature's Recovery but 30hp/tick is frankly a complete joke when typical mobs are hitting for 400 in Ssra, 300 in CT, ST, ToV, and 200 to 300 in most tougher xp zones The Deep etc.  Haveing to wait THREE MINUTES for a 900hp heal is just not comparable to what Torpor or CE gives you.  If you consider Nature's Recovery decent then start a necro because they'll far outheal you. <br>
 <br>
  I doubt we'll get low agro pulse heals, we're supposed to cast a NT and have every uncontrolled mob in the area eat our leather clad butts alive, and thats stepping on the cleric's toes like giving clerics fire nukes would be for us.  I doubt we'll get a higher efficiency instant heal than clerics without clerics getting a CH upgrade or a DL upgrade, but it's possible.  And even with a 3.3 hp/mana heal we're still, again, far and away, outclassed by shaman's 6 to 1 torpor (not to 75% slow which is just obscenely broken and overpowered, and their over 100mana/tick regen) and cleric's 5ish to 1 CE and 10 or 20 to 1 CH.<br>
 <br>
  Short of a 1k for 200 mana heal, which frankly ain't going to happen despite cleric nuke upgrades letting them outnuke us at certain levels and come respectably close at 60, we just aren't going to be healers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 12:36:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: healing</span><hr size=1> Caster balancing has to consider high-end balancing because that is where the greatest imbalance is.

<br>
I'm not worried about the nukes so much. I actually believe they will be buffing up overall nuking power when they do caster balancing and the worst thing that could happen to us is we get left where we are and are passed by mages. That wouldn't bother me because I think that either way we will end up with nuking power very close to what mages end up with and I don't see them getting nerfed. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>

That being said, I'm going to make a statement that I'm almost sure is going to bring flames, and I'm positive has been discussed elsewhere, but I'm gonna be lazy and not go find it.

Verant has made the statement that after a given amount of time, certain encounters should become trivial, but some things are just stupid.  I point to one issue in particular, just because it sticks out for me.  On my server, 5 manaburn wizards and a bard (yes, that's ONE group) killed Gorenaire with 0 deaths.  If anyone here can show me any other class that can accomplish this given the same levels and AA abilities, I'll retract my statement.  I don't care if it's 5 druids, or 5 warriors and a bard, or whatever...  put 5 of any class together with a bard and kill Gore with no outside assistance to show me that wizards aren't overpowered.  It can't be done.  Now, perhaps VI will find a way to make Gore a trivial encounter for a group of lvl 59+ people regardless of class, but I really don't see it happening.  VI likes to talk a big game about balancing, but I don't see them actually pulling it off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useriena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seriena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 1:24:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: healing</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Nerf<br>

But on a different note, a cold debuff would be nice. Or toss cold, fire, atk, ac debuff all in one, make it the druid version of Malo. (oh boy I can hear the cries of overpower on that idea).  But wait, there's more. Don't make it so that it hardly ever lands or that we have to debuff in order to debuff (i.e. Ro's Smoldering Disjunction). Make it actually useful and needed on high end encounters.<br>
<br>
So, in summary:<br>
<br>
1. Nerf Manaburn<br>
2. Improve our healing (a better ratio Nature's Touch and Nature's Recovery = Topor)<br>
3. Give us a debuff like Malo but for cold/fire/atk/ac<br>
4. Fix our epic<br>
<br>
Do these things and I'll be happy. <p><br><br><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117440" TARGET="_NEW">Seriena,</A> 60 druid<br>

1.  Shaman has the DoTs Druids have to nukes.  Giving Druids a large DoT, leaves Shaman behind on the damage front.<br>
<br>
2.  Shaman and Necros would throw a FIT!<br>

I personally think Druids should get either a Torpor like heal (low mana heal with side-effects), or an upgrade to Nature's Recovery (50hp per tick single target only with an instant recast time for a total of 1200hp healed). <p>

 <br>
  Again this steps on cleric's toes.  Part of being a better healer is being flexible.  But changing Nature's Recovery to be a group spell would be nice.  As it is it's nice but not as efficient as short duration heals and a horrible pain to time and it comes nowhere close to the necro theft line 720 in 9 ticks ZONEWIDE range to everyone in the party, or their 600 mana for 300 mana to everyone in the party (including the necro.)<br>
 <br>
  Any case where you're using Nature's Recovery as your primary heal Necros seriously outheal you.  And while their lack of NT makes them less than ideal healers for most raids for groups their mez can often compensate.<br>
 <br>
  Although there isn't anything wrong with getting outhealed by necros whose domain is life and death any more than us outnuking them when our domain is nature and the elements.  I would like more rock crushing and lightning bolting in my nukes though.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upoitez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poitez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 2:18:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: healing</span><hr size=1> Druids are relatively balanced until they get to raiding at 60.  I'm sure by now I've easily spent as much time, and more than likely much more, being 60 as 1-59.  At 60 a druid falls well below the curve in healing, in particular, and some other categories as well.  I would suggest giving druids a group Elixir series and/or a radically changed buff/debuff line.  Honestly I believe we need a major updrade; something as powerful as slow/CH, something that gives us a purpose.  I'll submit, for your approval, a quick comparison between druids and clerics.<br>
<br>
In kind of an argument/counter argument fashion I'll try to match up cleric skills vs. druid skills to strengthen my point.<br>
<br>
I figure Druids' porting and Clerics' ressing is relatively equal (some may disagree).  Both are massive timesavers, high end raiding as we know it would not exist with out both.<br>
<br>
Healing- Obviously Clerics well out match druids in healing.  Even discounting CH clerical healing is more efficent, quicker casting, and available in group + elixir varieties.<br>
<br>
Nuking- Druids have a decent edge in nuking with the advent of Moonfire.  I don't think it's anywhere near enough of a seperation though (in relation to the difference in healing).  I'd say we nuke about 15% better or so; of course we have no good magic based nukes and that's all clerics get; so it's hard to compare.  I think the exact ratios are 2.85/1 and 3.29/1 (or about 13% difference).<br>
<br>
Damage Shields-  I hate even talking about damage shields because ours aren't the best and thus not even really used in high end raiding, especially with a creator dagger.  Clerics of course have Mark of Karn/Retribution.  I'd honestly trade my DS's for the clerical ones, but that's my opinion.  There are drawbacks; they can be resisted etc...  They are however unique and useful in raiding.<br>
<br>
Buffing (other than DS) - Umm, no comparison; not even close.<br>
<br>
I'll clump other utility stuff together.  Clerics and druids get root, Druid root is much better.  We both get stuns (sorta) Clerics' stun is much better.  Druids have dots; they're semi-useful; but mobs have limited debuff slots and stacking DoD and other crap that could take the place of a good necro DoT isn't worth it.  I'd include snare in this discussion if I knew of a single high end encounter that it really adds anything to.<br>
<br>
So basically it doesn't look too bad from there.  We might be a bit underpowered but nothing horrible; unless of course clerics get the single most game breaking spell.  Which they do...  That's what we really need.  A whole new thing (whether heal, nuke, debuff, buff or otherwise) that makes people have a need for druids on raids.  <br>
<br>
Also, going off the Manaburn tangent, we could use some kind of cool AA skill too.<br>

<br>
*edit* As I was thinking about it...  I think a good upgrade for us would be a line of let's call them &quot;infusion&quot; spells.  Spells that would be relatively short duration buffs that would infuse a target with some power of nature.  They'd have to have a longish recast but be relatively powerful.  Could be things like a 2 minute buff (with 3 min recast or so) that would make the target be healed for 1/4 the damage he deals or something.  Or one that infuses a caster with focus item-esque effects (IE a few minute 30% additional damage on nukes).  Could give the person an extra damage proc with +/- aggro. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upoitez.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Poitez</A> at: 5/23/02 11:29:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrolmn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grolmn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 2:39:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: healing</span><hr size=1> Druids, Shamen, and Clerics should be given a level 58 2k heal.

I think that introducing little changes here and there is a major portion of the problem. The main jeolousy between classes that get a tweak and those that didn't spawns the whole storm of &quot;but they got...&quot; and &quot;we need.....&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
When they did melee balancing they put in all the damage table changes at once. Nice. Everyone got something and things were sorted out very well. Problems arise because they tweak pets a little every class that has a pet wants to see how theirs got tweaked and gets mioptic about that part of their class and why they feel they were left out.<br>

Europa, I have to disagree.<br>
<br>
Yes, adding one thing at a time often causes an uproar.  And the “but they got…” and “we need…” stuff makes it rather hard to judge how that change has affected the game.<br>
<br>
But that’s really the best way to do it for something as complicated as ‘caster balance’.<br>
<br>
For melee classes it really was just a matter of looking at their damage output (especially since we put off dealing with hybrid spell casting).  At that time, all we really had to do was sit down and decide what we wanted those numbers to be and then make the reality match them.  Ok, I make that sound easy, it wasn’t – it was a hell of a lot of work.<br>
<br>
We really can’t do that with casters.  When you’re talking about something that doesn’t have easily measured results, like healing or stunning or mana enhancement or whatever, then you have to take steps.  You have to make changes and watch the results, see how they affect other classes and all that.<br>
<br>
And, as Rich pointed out, even the small changes are big changes.<br>
<br>
While tossing a bunch of stuff into one patch may sound appealing, and it might appease those that get anxious when we make a change that doesn’t include them, it would be like tossing a few dozen stones into a calm pond and trying to figure out the effects of the ripples of each stone using a compass and an abacus.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

I don't like the &quot;we did some tweaking here and now we are going to do some there&quot; approach. It makes everyone who doesn't get tweaked &quot;next&quot; more upset. If you keep working one class or group of classes at a time you will only have more frustrated people wanting to know when you are going to get around to them, or come back around to them again because it wasn't enough now.<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There’s no denying that.  It happens, we’ve all seen it.  And it can make it tough to see the effects of the latest changes.<br>
<br>
But taking steps is a more, er, scientific method and makes it easier to know how each change affected the game.  We just have to trust that in the end folks will understand how and why we did it that way and that they’ll trust us in the results.  Not that we’ve done the best job of earning that trust in the past, but I’d like to think that since you’ve seen how the melee balance stuff went, and that the team pretty much nailed that, that you’d be willing to give us a little rope.  I have a ton of faith in our team and I think if you give us the time and help us take these steps that you’ll be pleased with the results.<br>

<br>
To what will caster balancing involve balancing damage output of the primary damage-dealing casters (which include wizards, mages, and druids, at a minimum) against the damage output of melee classes?  <br>
<br>
As you no doubt are aware, one of the primary concerns of casters in the past has been that combat, particularly high-end combat, is melee-centric.   You commented on the melee damage comparisons done for the various melee classes a while back.  Will there be any similar comparisons of caster damage to melee damage? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/02 3:45:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.interlynx.net/g/graem/tiaface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: healing</span><hr size=1> *doesnt know how to do the quote thing*<br>

Understandable, but let me counter with this.  We've seen only tiny changes in all this time.  Wizzies got some nice eye candy, a couple of seriously minor spell tunings, focus items (that get changed after obvious possible ubalancing effects, and at least one that still doesnt work).  We get told you cant do any changes cause of a big code patch...  ok so the patch is in.  it's 2 weeks later, and still the endless repetition &quot;We are working on caster balance, really!&quot;<br>
<br>
That's really just not good enough.  a) It shows absolutely zero respect for the casting community, who's sat here more or less patiently for a long time, wondering, waiting.  There needs to be a more specific dialogue than &quot;We're working on it, really!&quot;<br>
b) Hasnt it occured to you that the *huge* playerbase is a resource you are more or less ignoring when it comes to these changes?  You said it's hard, and you cant see all the ripples of what a small change might do.  Guess what, there's 100,000+ people out here who are willing to look and think about it!  If, for example, at some point someone had said &quot;Look we're thinking of putting in mage summoned focus items, one of which will shorten all casting times by x amount.&quot;  I can guarantee you someone would have posted about it unbalancing Complete Heal within an hour.  How much work and angst would that one thing have saved?<br>
<br>
Telling us you're working on &quot;It&quot; isnt good enough and it's silly.  Keeping us in the dark serves no purpose.  You say you're working on pets now.  You wanna track whats likely to happen?  Just say &quot;Hey we're thinking of increasing pet damage across the board by 10%, and making /pet hold a skill all pet classes get at 50, rather than an AA skill.&quot;  See how that flies on the message boards before dumping it unexpectedly on a live server near you.<br>
<br>
Communication is the key to customer satisfaction and loyalty.  Not to mention it just sounds better than &quot;We're working on it!&quot; almost 5 months later.<br>

<br>
CH - yep, stupid of VI to ever add it.  Hard to conceive of their short-sightedness, but they were so clueless about their own game, they allowed CH to come from a click effect on an item.  It should definitely be removed from the game, or all priest classes should get it and Clerics should be given some other special ability (giving one class the one spell the entire game is built around was collosally stupid, but it remains the fact that Clerics are defined and used almost exclusively because of that one spell, so if you get rid of it or if you give it to Druids and Shamman, you have to come up with something else very very nice to give Clerics or they become obsolete).  However, that said, it will never happen, at least not until EQ2.<br>
<br>
One thing I came accross above that I missed on my first couple of reads:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  This gets more complex because no class has just one single ability. So, say (hypothetically) that we add a better heal to druids. Clerics are immediately concerned because druids are now healing better- what do clerics get? Wizards grow concerned because now not only can druids nuke pretty well, they also can heal even better than previously, making them a potentially better deal for a group or raid looking for members. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is a really ammusing example.  The two casters classes that are actually too good as the game stands now are hypothsized as whining about improvements Druids (which along with Necros and Mages, are most in need of improvement).  Sadly, he is probably right <p>____________<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13463"

Am I the only one that sees the irony between this statement and the fact that clerics can land nukes for full dmg on the AoW and I can't land anything? And that's NOT the only mob this happens on. The cleric nukes land damn well on a LOT of big mobs - the same ones I cannot land spells on.<br>
<br>
There was a thread somewhere on safehouse I think where someone noticed a cleric getting a kill shot on an uber mob. They asked around and found out half their clerics had been nuking the entire fight - why? because unlike druids their nukes actually land. <p>Kahlus Naester
