All i can tell you is that the aftermath has been filled with drama.  The people that awoke the Sleeper are now hated by more guilds than you can imagine.  They definitely deserve much of the blacklisting because they did it in a very lame manner.  I'm not going to get into that though, just know the people that did it broke a server-wide agreement not to awaken the Sleeper, and worked it so they only had to kill the weakest warder to awaken him.  <br><br>I was thinking about this, and thinking why would Verant create something thats supposed to be such a huge accomplishment, but that accomplishment has adverse effects on the server.  The reward for such an accomplishment(being done the right away hypothetically)is basically being hated by every guild on your server.  It just doenst make sense.  I'm not in any means using Verant's dumb logic to defend what those people did.  They did it for their own personal greed, or just to be assholes.  They are reaping what they sew'd, and i'm sure most of them if not all of them regret it now.  I just dont understand the whole point of Awakening the Sleeper when the reward is probably the worst thing that can happen to your reputation.<br><br>I've heard theories like &quot;Its a lesson in guild cooperation&quot; or &quot;not all major feats have positive rewards&quot;, but its just too hard for me to buy.  I keep hearing how the server changes with primals being more rare, but easier to acquire.  Overall, the consensus seems to be that the server is definitely worse off with the Sleeper awake.  I just dont get it, a major accomplishment with the worst possible reward imaginable.  Is that really the way it is?  Or are the players just mis-informed and awakening the Sleeper isnt nearly that bad and theres stuff most people dont know about thats for the better?  Could it possibly be end-game content Verant tries to deter people from doing just so they have something out there that hasnt been done?  Again, i just cant understand the logic behind creating the ultimate quest where the end result should be a reward, but its actually a punishment.<br><br>Any opinions, facts, theories, or anything to add?  I'd love to hear them )  <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usobesilvertree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sobe Silvertree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/4/02 12:11:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/sobe/tag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening the Sleeper.....</span><hr size=1> Heh well truthfully the sleeper being awoken doesn't have bearing over all on a server, IE with a Soulbound key you can still go in and get your Avatar Weapons, without the threat of the Dragons. It means the Higher End guilds won't be hogging the Tomb to kill the Dragons anymore.<br><br>Over all there was some items lost to the dragons dying such as the resist stones and a gnome illusion mask for Bards and Rogues.. IE: Toys. Yes there was some okay stuff that dropped, but easily replacable by higher end items. (except the Gnome Mask which I believe was a mistake from VI to put that mask there in the first place).<br><br>Over all the Avatar weapons will drop more often off the now main mobs in the Sleeper Tomb and some items that comes from the Scale that will now drop.<br><br>Does it effect the server, some say yes, some say no - from what I can see, more guilds are able to go to the Tomb now that the dragons are dead and Avatar weapons drop more often then they did before. <p><hr><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00" vlink="#00FF00" alink="#00FF00"><div align="center"><center><table border="3" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#008080" bordercolordark="#000000" bordercolorlight="#008080"><tr><td valign="top" width="100%" background="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/sobe/back.gif"><p align="center"><font color="#80FF00" size="4" face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Sobe Silvertree</strong></font><font color="#FFFF80" face="Trebuchet MS"><br></font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"</font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Sobe" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Wanderer</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">" and "</font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kibadachi_uk/epiclink.htm" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">1st Tunarian Protector</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"<br>Elder Hierophant of </font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Guild Afterlife</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><br>Administrator of </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Druids Grove</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"></font></p></td></tr></table></center></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxicantempestwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xican TempestWolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/4/02 12:41:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Weeee.</span><hr size=1> Wait a second...Your server is mad because...<br><br>+Primal drops.  -Gnomes.  -Risk.<br><br>Your server made the biggest mistake when they forgot to pass the crack pipe, and didn't Gimp Ventani and the crew's ass 6 months ago.  ;)<br><br>Really though, killing the sleeper has little to know negative effects.

However, it does turn the zone from a guild raid into a 2-3 group boring farming session.  Also, you lose your chance at SoDs and 4th Warder loot (the only good/useful stuff there really aside from the primal - gnome masks arent useful, more of an abomination).   So there is some trade off - easier to get primals in small groups vs. a couple of nice warder specific loot (resist stones, caster/priest staves, various masks, bracers, etc are mediocre at best nowdays even SoDs arent as highly desirable with higher aggro/better ratio alternatives out there).   It is very questionable which ST is better - faster respawn with lot easier mobs so you can get out the zone faster/equip primal faster (and very small chance at scale for uber loot), or warders for a guild raid that can drop a couple of nice items from 4th warder that disappear once released.  However, I have noticed that 4th warder tends to drop alot of primal spears so that may be a faster route to primalize rogues than post-sleeper golem farming.<br><br>Oh yeah, any guild that releases the sleeper without killing the 4th warder themselves is just gimp ;p. <p>Fayne Dethe<BR> Level 60 Druid of Xegony<BR>Havenlight</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uligge.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ligge</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/4/02 2:26:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqguide.com/changingtide/images/ligsmall.jpg width=100 height=129></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening the Sleeper.....</span><hr size=1> Not gonna dwell on this as we have had enough discussions on server boards /slap Broom why did you bring this here! *snicker*<br><br>Two things of importance here and you got one right and the other wrong.<br><br>The entire server of ST capable people and those soon to be ST capable guilds had agreed not to do this.

It's also stupid to say that awakening the Sleeper has no negative effects.  First of all, not every guild that can do ST can kill AoW or Creator.  We're in this area ourselves because we don't have a large base of hardcore 12-hour-a-day players.  These guilds would like more SoDs and shrouds and whatnot.  Also, AA is making the old Velious mobs much easier.  People who couldn't get ST keys before Luclin are now getting them; in part because the old guilds that were getting them no longer are. <br><br>If you are in the super uber guild who does not need Warder loot at the moment then just @#%$ leave after you get what you want, it's that simple.  There's no reason to permanently take it away from others who still need it.  We don't kill Telkorenar and Gozzrem any more but I wouldn't permanently disable them if given the choice.  <br><br>Furthermore, I heard from someone that FoH posted the requirements for applicants who want to switch servers.  To me that means they don't have the solid base they used to and could use a little bump in attendance maybe.  EQ is 3 years old and the newness of each expansion is wearing off quicker.  This means that guild turnover is getting higher so you need to replace members with people who aren't as well equipped.  Imagine taking a warrior who had a Wavecrasher and Frostbringer into ST for one night and he comes out with an SoD, Primal sword/hammer, Primal bow and resist stones.  That's a big improvement for very little effort.<br><br>Releasing the Sleeper is stupid, end of story.  Any arguments that there are no negative effects are not only false, but more than easily countered by the fact that there are no positive effects. <p><font face="Verdana" size="-2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45589">Aeryl Firebrand</a>, Warlord<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65788">Aeril Droigheann</a>, 59 Preserver, Semi-Retired<br><a href="http://www.freshpope.com/undaunted/">Undaunted</a>, Xegony<br></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uweoden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Weoden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/4/02 10:54:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~craigdphilips/rosephoto.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening the Sleeper.....</span><hr size=1> awakening the sleeper means the loss of sods on that server... <p><CENTER><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92277"><IMG SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~craigdphilips/weofinal.jpg"></a> </font><br><CENTER><b> (Ret)Aaroan - Druid - Lv 60 </b><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usobesilvertree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sobe Silvertree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/4/02 11:23:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/sobe/tag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening the Sleeper.....</span><hr size=1> <i>It's not entirely accurate to say that you can get more Primal once the Sleeper is awakened.

That serves the same purpose and still lets you come back in case you ever need anything.  You can't counter that argument with the essence crap or anything else.

Yes your main weapon is a twink weapon on my server its being sold and re-sold on my server, so get over it already - <u>"again this is from our experience with the Sleeper awoken on our server"</u>, if you can't get that thru your Warlords skull, maybe its time that you and your guild level or recruit more and get some AA points and build the inner streagth of your guild instead of complaining and believing that its all someone elses fault. <br><br>The funny thing is you are complaining about something that you already have and bluntly tell us you have. And if you don't have an Avatar weapon at the moment I suggest you get your tush down there and get one, its up to you and your guild before the Ring of Vulak is fixed.. IE: Its broken right now so many uber guilds are not doing NToV and if they are well hey that means they a bit late in the game for pharming Velious Gear for their people and need to get there butts to Luclin so they don't fall way behind the curve on the gear thats offered there, because really if your still pharming NTOV for anything other then Vulak Loot, I don't consider that very Uber, I consider you LATE (this doesn't include PvP servers, they are on a different time line and all blubie servers understand that).<br><br>Once the ring is Fixed I see many uber guilds going back, Vulak Loot is still good - I believe your venting to the wrong crowd. Let me put it this way - In my guild I could of gotton a primal weapon.. but there were MONKS that NEEDED the weapon before me.. and if a weapon dropped and all the Monks had one, then it would obviously go to "any melee class that could use it" before it would go to any Priest class... Guess what.. NO PRIEST CLASS has one and really IMO doesn't need one. So we only go back when we have some of our newer members Melees need them this allows much farming of the weapons by the younger guilds and no dragons are there for our interest. Why did "WE" kill the last Warder? Because it was there to be killed, a challenge, and a right of passage. Unfotunatly this doesn't hold true to each server, some servers may have set up rules etc, well if they break the rules your server will do what is necessary to clean it up. For example, we used to post in our IRC chat what we were doing that day and when; at first many of the guilds on the server respected that and didn't screw with it, and we didn't screw with their raids. <br><br>Well to make a long story short they started to take that information and kill what we intended to kill that day earlier on since they were a European guild or a Japanese guild, so what we do? (Excert from our guild page).<br><br>Tuesday September 25, 2001   <br>Posted by Arele <br>A Day In The Life....Afterlife.<br><br><br>Dozekar the Cursed<br>Lord Yelinak<br>Eashen of the Sky<br>Ikitiar the Envenomed<br>Aaryonar<br>Dagarn the Destroyer<br>Lord Feshlak<br>Lord Kriezen<br>Lord Koi`Doken<br>Zlexak<br>Sevalak<br>Cekenar<br>Lady Mirenilla<br>Lord Vyemm<br>Vulak'Aerr<br>King Tormax<br>Derakor the Vindicator<br>The Statue of Rallos Zek<br>Dain Frostreaver IV <br> <br>Final Score:   Afterlife = 19        EQ Mobs = 0<br>Not bad for a day's work. <br><br>-- what this did was showed that yes we can kill them all and leave nothing for you and your guild to do, but all this time we haven't chosen to do so and now we will go anon/roleplay and not post in our IRC what we are doing so other guilds couldn't plan their raids with our information. We tried the correct way, we were following up on the Server Main Message board because many guilds would schedule raids and we work around that, we even posted there till that fell apart because all guilds were not following it.  At the time no other guild could kill Vulak. <br><br>Sound Pomposs? sure it is, but we didn't intend for this to happen, our guild leaders actual like to work with other guilds and pre-plan raids, this creates a nice balance on the server and a bit of competition, and most importantly a nice atmosphere. So if this one guild did all this to you and you feel betrayed or what have you, then BLOCK THEM.. ORGANIZE.. Make them Understand this chit won't go un-noticed, if you can't then screw it and pharm what needs to be pharmed to make your guild stronger, don't forget your Pure Casters and Stay true to your damage dealers,  Main Tanks and especially your Priest.<br><br> - As for RNG, 1 handers vs 2 handers dropping, thats something we all deal with, but Avatar is avatar, in the beginning many of the melee would get 2 handers just to have the proc (increased damage by 33%) and when 1 handers dropped they were upgraded.<br><br> - Let me reiterate!  This is what goes on on my server - your server maybe different, so defend yourself if you must but realize I am talking from my own experience.<br> <p><hr><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00" vlink="#00FF00" alink="#00FF00"><div align="center"><center><table border="3" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#008080" bordercolordark="#000000" bordercolorlight="#008080"><tr><td valign="top" width="100%" background="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/sobe/back.gif"><p align="center"><font color="#80FF00" size="4" face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Sobe Silvertree</strong></font><font color="#FFFF80" face="Trebuchet MS"><br></font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"</font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Sobe" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Wanderer</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">" and "</font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kibadachi_uk/epiclink.htm" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">1st Tunarian Protector</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"<br>Elder Hierophant of </font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Guild Afterlife</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><br>Administrator of </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Druids Grove</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"></font></p></td></tr></table></center></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uweoden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Weoden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/5/02 9:25:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=632.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~craigdphilips/rosephoto.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Awakening the Sleeper.....</span><hr size=1> Primal Velium Warsword<br>Dmg 13, Dly 20. +10 AC +5 Str +5 Sta +5 Agi +5 Dex +5 Wis +5 Int +5 Cha +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +50 HP +50 Mana +2.50 Wt <br>Effect: Avatar<br><br>I disagree that this is better for isses of taunt.
