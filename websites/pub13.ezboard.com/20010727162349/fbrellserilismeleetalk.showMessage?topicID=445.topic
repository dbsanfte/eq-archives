<br>
Paladin's armor drop in planes -- will occur....now and then, will occur in singles, will require you to hit Fear 20, maybe 30 times before you have acquired -half- the suit.  (/rips his hair out) (I was lucky to complete my set around Fear raid 11 or 13..can't recal any more)<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
All in all, though, I like paladins and their ability to heal.  The argument always stands as to how good your character is...well, thats up to you, and how well you want to make him.  This requires playing strategy, such as the use of shield buffs for your group members, not just for yourself, using your taunt skill and stun spells to pull aggro on to yourself rather than letting the main tank take all of the damage, knowing when to LoH the first member to reach 1 bubble of health to keep them alive -- sacrifice that LoH for another group member.  I'm shocked, and pissed, even at my level to see paladins save their LoH for themselves like greedy little peons, when a group member is dieing.  <br>
<br>
Armor matters more so for us I would say than warriors.  Warriors seem to have it made on the ac, Indocilite seems to always have 5-15 ac more per item vs. Vallorium. (Vallorium bp is 30 ac...Indocilite is somewhere over 40 ac..I'm pretty sure on that 40, might be right around that value).  Your haste item matters greatly, as does your weapon.  Grab a high ac shield, save up for it if you have to (or become Erudite, and acquire the Maestro shield from Hate), and get the tops in haste items.  My oppinion on worth would be CoF or CoCW.  Both are superb ac, stats, and haste (36%), but CoCW offers 50mana vs. CoF's 50 hp.  And you want the mana-- again, my preference, since you can cast, the extra mana is as good as your  60damage 5 second stun.  So, get your armor, its possible to surpass 1000ac, I did it myself recently, and its VERY nice...get a tops haste item (attend the raids,  it'll drop, you'll get it, or the scale...and acquire that weapon that offers the quickest hitting with best damage result.  Shields are a must until epic (but don't include epic on your decision...epics are a pain in the butt).<br>
<br>
Being a paladin allows you to step back from battle and act as a back up cleric when the true cleric is down, or, to equip your wisdom gear and sit out of the battles and med for heals, when you are the only cleric-type in the group.  I've noticed this more and more once I reached level 54.  Level 57 opens the gates for an even better ability to heal, with a spell dumping nearly 600 hp in to a target.  And you get rez with xp, eventually.  The latter examples are something to look forward to, something to work up to.<br>
<br>
I'd fill a group with paladins any day.  2-4 pally's will always ensure you will have a good time.  It's fun and challenging...when it comes down to a last minute decision on rooting the mob and medding (or using your DW Helm to keep the group members alive with the 100hp continuous buff).  <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
SK's -- I don't know an awful lot about this class.  My experiences have been on planar raids and in groups with friends that are this class.  Post 50 is when SK Pet's (yes, they get a skeleton) is worth a lick.  The fact that they get to conjure a pet as a necro does, equip it with a weapon (and I've heard post 50, at some point, you can equip with 2?..unsure), is great.  I've seen peeps in LGuk use their pet to take the Harm Touch from the Ghoul Lord ((oh my, is that the name? It's been so long now hehe...Lord Room, where Yak drops).  Later on, SK's get the ability to summon corpses, so when you are hunting for a necro to get your corpse out of a deep zone...well, you don't need to any more.  SK's get dots, life taps, 2 spell bases that are tops in my book, because I always like to rely on dots, even in planes.  Life taps are aken to heals, although perhaps less powerful, the ability is still there.  Their Harm Touch which can be invoked, is a very nice skill to have -- I'm unsure, but pre-50 HT does maybe 500? 750? damage.  Unsure on that.  <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Both classes can only single wield.  Both classes get some seriously nice weapons in 1h and 2h choice.  There are some 'must have' weapons for both classes.  Sword of the Mourning is a must have for paladins, and my oppinion, Mace of Shadowed Souls is a must have for SK's.  Both are similar in damage/delay.  <br>
<br>
SK's really do get an easier chance at planar loot once you are 46+.<br>
<br>
Paladins can tank nearly as well as Warriors.  Warriors will have more HP at base, prior to buffs, but that warrior is also wailing on the mob more often, with their dual wield death-wish.  Paladin's, at level 54, have the ability to transfer aggro from the main tank when a life-threatening situation occurs for the warrior or another group member, merely by the spells they have at their disposal.  Stun, Force, Might, and a flame based DD will total 275 damage and a roughly 5 seconds of stun on a mob, definitely in time to piss them off and keep the aggro on you.  If your warrior is dieing...this is prime.  And if LoH is up, warrior shouldn't die, as the LoH will heal a good portion of that boy's hp's.  The stun spells you begin acquiring I -think- after level 22...or perhaps its 30.  I honestly didn't learn the true good of passing aggro to me until I went in to the hole with a friend and my group.  She explained how paladins can use their stuns consecutively to grab the mob's attention.  I wish I had known that 20 levels ago.  But in any case...the stuns are prime for paladins.  And that 125dd?  Ahhhhh, yes!<br>
<br>
Paladin's can tack on an additional ...hmm...850'ish hp and 30-40'ish ac by buffs once level 53.  His buffs help beginning at level 9, but the mana is so little, he will have trouble keeping the group buffed if he is to fight.  The mana starts evening out once you pass level 40.  At level 49 you get some seriously balancing buffs for the class, with the onset of Armor of Faith and a couple others.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Hope that helps some.  I'm biased towards Paladin's because I play one.  But I wouldn't hold it against an SK to tank as well as myself.  I&quot;m sure they can come close, if not equal a paladin.<br>
<br>
One thing -- as you gain level, you will notice that your hunting grounds will generally be much nearer to good cities rather than evil cities.  But /shrug, that doesn't much matter in the long haul.<br>

<br>
First, as Moonfray said, we are half necro, half warrior. We receive a skeleton pet. However, this pet will never be more than half your level, often much lower... Until level 58. The vast majority of our pets serve two purposes: First, it's a DoT you only have to cast when it dies. Second, it's great for giving a party that extra 5 seconds of 'Run away, run away' time.. This all changes with the 49  pets, which begin to duel wield, have enough hit points to take a few lickings and keep on ticking.. The level 58 pet, which is the 44 necro spell, summons what is considered to be one of the very best necro pets, and is capable of doing things like lifetapping and camping upper guk, all on its very own. <br>
<br>
We receive Lifetaps. These aren't really used as heals until the highest levels, mmm... Drain Soul... as they simply don't take enough. They're better used so that the healer of the party has the time to heal the caster before she's forced to deal with you. <br>
<br>
We receive DoTs. Much like the pet, they are severely under level. They won't really do noticeable damage to a mob your own level, again, until the very highest levels. However, even at the lower levels, they let us do exactly what we do better than anyone else in the game.. Taunt. Shadowknights begin to get level appropriate dots, again, in the 50  game, beginning with Dooming Darkness at 49, as well as Boil Blood, Cascading Darkness and Asystole(Spelling?) later on.<br>
<br>
A shadow knight can out taunt any other class in the game, with the proper combination of spells. There's something about multiple debuffs and DoTs combined with fast, hard, hits that just really, really irks a mob off. Generally, when I feel it's worth the effort, I can keep a mob glued on me. A chain stunning paladin can usually peel it off me, for about 6 seconds, when the next pulse of all three DoTs hits, and it remembers just why it hates me. <br>
<br>
Again, at the higher levels, we begin to gain the ability to buff our attack and AC ratings directly, draining the strength and toughness from our enemies. Unlike the paladin buffs, these buffs will stack with high end cleric buffs, and it's not uncommon for me to be buffed by 101 AC points between the cleric, ranger, and myself. <br>
<br>
Even in the lower levels, a Shadow Knight is one of the few melee types that can be expected to solo effectively, with the ability to both snare(Darkness) and Fear. While it certainly can be messy, it is more reliable than root/heal. <br>
<br>
Unlike the paladin or warrior, we are built for stealth as well, as much so as the necro or the enchanter. With a short casting self-invis, and invis to undead, we can get places with an ease that other melee classes(excepting the rogue) can only dream of.<br>
<br>
And then, there is the last important ability of a Shadow Knight. At level 30, we gain the spell Feign Death... I'm sure I don't need to expound upon the miracle that is FD to a warrior.  <br>
<br>
However, for all this high end miracle working, we have to battle our way through 40 or 50 levels of, well, sucking. You will, as either a paladin or a SK do less damage than a warrior. You will have fewer hit points, and unless you have the best of gear, less AC. Further, with the lack of self healing, buffs, etc, with a good portion of your offense being such that an enchanter cannot mez something you're fighting to make breathing room, the lack of blending in your spell book, a mid level SK has very little room for error. Harm touch, your emergency damage/taunt button, begins to fall off in value at about level 30, until around level 50. Pre 40, it does Level*10 1 damage., post 40 it goes up 30 point a level.<br>
<br>
Basically, though, the worth of an SK is entirely dependant upon the skill of the person behind it: A well played, well geared SK is a god of death capable of wreaking havoc anywhere, anywhen, with help or without(/grovel Starseed!). A competent, single SK can still bring a great deal to a group, although a paladin might bring more, and paladins certainly don't suffer as much loss of efficiency when there are even more paladins in the party. An incompetent SK is the first to die. <br>
<br>
In summary, the path of a Shadow Knight is as harsh and cruel as the man or woman that walks it, but the rewards at the end of that path are very great indeed.  <p><center>Arathena Dracheseele<br>

<br>
1: AC/HP. These are two sides of the same coin, and serve only one purpose: To let you meat shield a touch longer. You'll have to strike your own balance between them, it's something you run by feel. However, be forewarned. These numbers will only begin to approach a warriors with the very best of gear. Despite our recent gain in Defensive skill, our armor is of poorer quality than the equivalent warrior gear. You will also have fewer hit points, although there have also been vast improvements from the days of Rogue-like HP and AC. <br>
<br>
2: Mana. This is what, in theory, will allow you to make up for your weakness in HP and AC. This includes Int/Wis, and  Mana gear. Although we no longer have a smaller mana pool than our parent classes, we still pay more per spell casting, as we obtain the same spells at a higher level. Further, as Hybrids, we never gain the ability to specialize, meaning that we will always pay the full, inflated, mana cost for our spells. Also, since you will be throwing yourself into the fray with both body and words, your time to meditate is drastically reduced, and the size of your mana pool must be sufficient to cover for this. <br>
<br>
3: Resists. Other than raids, these are more or less pointless. Magic is the only one that the important spells, such as slow, snare, etc, check against, and these days, I've been praying that the mob takes the time to start casting Ice comet at me... It's 6 seconds that he's not wailing at me with his 80 damage, 10 delay fists. However, you will have to pay a little attention to your MR, as you do not gain the level bonus to any of your resists that a warrior does to his MR. <br>
<br>
Hrm, that's about all I can think of, and it shouldn't be much different from any experience you might have as a warrior. <br>
<br>

<br>
As tanks I love either one in any of my groups.  The spells that augment them makes them truely fun to play I think, and most are versatile enough to make a huge difference.<br>
<br>
In lower guk (40-50) I always made sure to get as many of either in my groups.  <br>
<br>
Imo the SK has a slightly higher survivability because the class comes with FD.  As for fun factor, that is entirely based on the player's ability.  <br>
<br>
One final word.  I have met more good SKs than Paladins (just numbers).  It is easier to play a Paladin than play him/her well (since you are not kos in most places).  An SK is generally good at higher levels because they have that instinctive survivability pounded into them at lower levels.<br>

That comes with level, as well with specific gear...6ac, 65hp rings (a must have later on--jewelry) and I can't recal what else I wear =P.<br>
Like I said (I think...) you get hp buffs from spells that will tally a good 700hp by level 53...and 1000+ by level 56 or 57...geesh, forgetting my own details here now =)<br>
<br>
<br>
AC -- tops.  The most important aspect of a paladin, primarily because he can pick wisdom gear up along his travels.  The RO planar armor offers a bit, any camp you sit at will offer some, sooner or later, and karnors is loaded with Jarsyth armor.  You WILL someday be required to play cleric.  I recently did this with a fellow paladin in Sebilis.  And I've gone solo on cleric'ing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck -- picka  class you'll enjoy.  Personally, rogues seem fun hehe =)<br>

Arathena and Moonfray said the most.<br>
Very good!<br>
<br>
I think the AC question is also a question of the race u choose.<br>
I am a DE SK and personal i prefer not the AC againts the str.<br>
sounds silly for some ..but my thoughts about that are....a ogre or a troll SK dont have to think about teh str problem. but as a DE it is worth to think about. i still wear a*cheap* necklace that give me str and int.and i wear rings that give me str. and dex.<br>
I think i dont see a different in the dmg i must take when i have 900 or 1000 AC but i see a big different in the dmg i do with more str. specialy when u use a 2h weapon.<br>
<br>
I also think that the int. make u able to cast a lot more on spells as lower int races SK.<br>
some people still say we hybrids are not Tanks i think all that fought with SK must see that we are great in pulling,tanking,parking(undead),snaring,and dmg dealing. LOL yes i love it to be a SK. hehe<br>
 i also use my pet the most time ... sure its more work to fight and hold it under control . but also our pets will deal good dmg when u are soloing or grouping.<br>
<br>
And at least my greatest respect to all  that was growing  up with this class.<br>
because i think it is really not easy to survive as an SK.<br>

<br>
I'd like to add that post 50 I'm starting to wish I had put more stats into agi, dex and sta during character creation. This is of course from the perspective of an ogre(maybe a troll too, Ruut?).<br>
<br>
One more thing to add about our ability to agro. It is all for not if you do not have the AC/HP gear to ensure that you don't die instantly, else you might as well be a ranger :P<br>
<br>
I think it was already said, but...<br>
<br>
Being an SK at the lower levels is ROUGH. You don't get FD and invis til lvl 30. Until then you are guard fodder. None of that sissy running to guards to save you from a_orc_02.<br>
<br>
You'll quickly learn to pay more attention to your enviroment if you wanna succeed<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
FD can seem very useless at times. If you wanna FD pull like a monk be warned. You have a long recast time on the FD spell. If you fail, chances are you are going to die if you don't have the AC/HP gear to live through to the next recast time.<br>
<br>
Best things about our class on a RAID: We can taunt any NPC off a caster reguardless of the NPCs level. This makes it alot easier for us to take control of a rampaging NPC that is storming through the camp picking off caster who decided it was a good idea to sit down and med while pulls are incoming. Secondly we are backup corpse summoners.<br>
<br>
Best thing about our class on an EPIC ENCOUNTER: We bring quick agro and can ensure that if anyone, we die first(much the same as some rangers do in an epic encounter). This gives other time to debuff the target, and gives the warriors time to match our agro(warriors build agro slowly/shadowknights build agro quickly).<br>
<br>
Best things about our class in a GROUP: We are excellent taunters, good tanks, good damage and debuff members. With good equipment we are good pullers, even better with the right equipment or levels(ie blood ember greaves or lvl 60 spell Death Peace).<br>
<br>
...but don't take my word for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Pull with a Darkness series spell to snare/DoT/Blind, Sick pet on MoB (gives one time for next spell), Fear, DoT some more, chase the enemy wacking on him until he is dead. SK's should be able to Fear Kite enemies like this that are yellow all day long. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Note: </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> DO NOT attempt this in a dungeon. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Another tip for playing an SK is always type &quot;/pet taunt off&quot; as soon as you create a pet. Also, I never arm a pet or Fear Kite yellows until I know the pet can take a few hits. <br>
<br>
If you are fighting casters in a group, take along a couple of cheap shields and a blunt (or a Gnoll Whip) and equip your pet with these. Even the lowest level pets can shield bash effectively. Otherwise, equip the pet with the heaviest damage two-hander you can find.<br>
<br>
The SK Snare (Darkness series) is a taunt/DoT/Blindness that outclasses Ranger and Druid Snare. I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> always</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> insist on snaring is a group. The Ranger/Druid Snare with overwrite the SK/Necro Darkness so all other Snarers must be made aware of this. <br>
<br>
Another hint is to make two hot keys for your primary and secondary pallets. One should say &quot;/pet attack&quot; and the other &quot;/pet back off&quot;. This way you can control the pet in battle. Also, sometimes it is easier to assist the pet then to try to get it to switch targets. Finally, pulling for a group with a pet up is next to impossable.<br>
<br>
The only other thing I can think of that was not mentioned about SK's is that at level 9 we get Locate Corpse. This comes in very handy.<br>
