<br>
It's OK to kill him if you see that he has spawned. If there's a force already there, I wouldn't go after him.<br>
<br>
--Would druid tracking find him from the Zone entrance?<br>
<br>
If a druid can track Nagafen from the entrance, he should be able to track Zordak. I don't think this is possible though, however it might be with the new cap increase in tracking for druids.<br>
<br>
--If I am assembling a team together at Zoneline and he is up does that consider me the next up if no one else in zone needs him...and so if someone comes along after I am there getting ready and getting peeps together, can they bring a ready made crew and kill first?<br>
<br>
Of course they can. It's your responsibility to reason with them and to let them know that you were there first. I think most people would be courteous enough to pass if you had a sizeable force already there, but this is a part that many clerics are competing over and tempers may flare.<br>
<br>
--Does he spawn every 24 hours after naggy is dead or is it random?<br>
<br>
Either 24 or 36, I have heard both but not confirmed this. <p><html>

Here is how the same question might be asked from the other party's point of view:<br>
<br>
--If we have a party well-prepared and already assembled at the druid ring in Lava, and then zone in to find someone else still beginning to assemble a party at the zone line, does that mean we have to give up all the effort we put in and yield to the guy who's not even ready yet? <p>Ismena

The situation with this very rare spawn and last part of the Cleric Epic quest is currently intolerable, and only going to get worse.<br>
<br>
Recently other epic quest we're altered to reduce the intesnse competition and ill feeling generated by a final rare spawn, yet the cleric epic remains unaltered. Currently on every server there are multiple people camped out in Solb to pounce on Zordak Ragefire should he ever appear, and the tension generated by having so many guilds/clerics forced to compete for the right to spawn the dragon is intense.. and as more clerics get to this stage the intesity of feeling is only going to increase. Coupled with the fact that with server outages Ragefire becomes an even rarer spawn still .. it can get very unpleasant.<br>
<br>
Please review the situation with the spawn.<br>
<br>
Well, oddly enough, the Ragefire setup is the one we used as a basis for the changes to other quests.<br>
<br>
The only competition over Ragefire is by clerics. The issues that we were addressing were where two, three or more classes wanted to kill an epic NPC. The problem here is completely different.<br>
<br>
The 'problem' here is that this particular epic is the most desired epic item in the game. The problem is that everyone is making this their priority; clerics, guilds, groups… everyone. The problem isn't the bottleneck, it's the fact that so many people are trying to get this item.<br>
<br>
The Ragefire portion of this quest is not much different than other bottlenecks in other epic quests. Sure, we could move the bottleneck (and, most likely, force you to start over, since the bottleneck is currently at the end of the quest). But it would still have to exist. We need to control how many of these items exist in the game, control their rate of entry into the system.<br>
<br>
I have read all of the comments made about this issue. While I can see that this is a concern, the solution is that people need to get along. We can't control the fact that so many people feel that they need to get this item and are willing to screw with other people to get it. The two solutions to that are to just give one to every cleric over 50th level, or to remove (or nerf) the item.<br>
<br>
The cleric epic is not going to enter the world any faster than it does. Because of its perceived value, there are no obstacles that we could put in the path of obtaining it that would retain its current drop rate that wouldn't be a 'bottleneck'.<br>
<br>
Some folks sent in actual suggestions for change. I'd like to address some of those ideas (sorry, but I'm only posting the parts of the comments with the suggestions, so these are somewhat out of context):<br>
<br>
Please have the team look at these problems, I personally don't think one voice can accomplish much, but this problem is only getting worse.<br>
<br>
Some possible sugestions to fix this.<br>
1. please put nagafen on a timer so he kills himself after being up for a few days, or you could have ragefire spawn and kill him for us. (this would fit into the quest)<br>
2. Make ragefire a timed spawn, the problem with this is deciding how long it could take to spawn him, every 24 hours +- 7 hours would be about right.<br>
3. Make RageFire triggered, this is the most unlikly thing to happen but, its only a sugestion.<br>
4. Make RageFire spawn in different places, a lot of the cleric epic centers around the lavastorm area, which goes with the story, but there are other places you could have him spawn.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to my ideas,<br>
<br>

<br>
1. No. Nagafen isn't going to just kill himself. He is one of THE epic encounters for those that haven't purchased expansions, and he's not going to just off himself so a cleric can have an epic weapon.<br>
2. It IS a timed spawn… Very similar to what you suggest.<br>
3. He is also triggered, just as you suggest.<br>
4. This might be something that we could do. But you're slightly wrong, he is intimately linked with Nagafen, and moving him and changing this quest would require a rewrite, and might completely invalidate the existing quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Fujin- wrote:<br>
<br>
Bottom line, I would like to make three requests on behalf of the clerics out there. <br>
<br>
1. Our weapon is arguably the most useful in the game, and is by all means epic. However, please make the last encounter a bit more difficult than killing a level 54 dragon. Perhaps upping the difficulty to around that of Ixiblat and the Overking, or perhaps a little tougher. Beating up a level 54 dragon is trivial for many guilds, and though the cleric comes away happy, the final &quot;epic battle&quot; is somewhat of a joke.<br>
<br>
2. Do something about Nagafen. Many clerics out there are stuck because the guild cannot attack Nagafen because their levels are too high. Something needs to be done to handle the fact that the guild that killed the overking and Ixiblat is too powerful to attack Nagafen. Whether Verant realized this at the time the quest was implemented, they have made Lord Nagafen an integral part of the epic quest.<br>
<br>
3. Please allow those of us on our final step a more feasable way to obtain our epic weapon, whether the spawn rate on Zordak is increased, or allow him to be a triggerred spawn like Faydedar is for the druid epic now. It's an incredible letdown to have come this far, only to realize that you have to wait in line for possibly months to get your chance.<br>
<br>
1. Well, the fact that it could be considered the best available is, primarily, the cause of all of this conflict. You mentioned earlier (in part of your comment that I cut out), that you thought there might be 20-25 clerics waiting for this part of their epic on your server. There probably aren't that many of any other class working on their epic at all, in any stage, on your server. This indicates to me that the problem lies in the perceived value of the item, not in the quest itself.<br>
<br>
But I think I agree that the final battle isn't nearly hard enough. However, increasing the power of this final NPC would not solve the issue at hand.<br>
<br>
2. Nagafen doesn't live long on many servers. But I can see the inconsistency in this issue, if nothing else. However, many clerics overcome this problem by offering to aid people to destroy Nagafen, and in a way this promotes the kind of thing we like to see in game.<br>
<br>
3. He IS a triggered spawn. The 'triggered' spawn is only an idea to ensure that at least one person in the group has done the previous parts of the quest before they can encounter the next. And I can't imagine that we would increase the rate that these items enter the game. There are already a large number of these supposedly rare artifact-like items in the game.<br>
<br>
So, enough complaints. On to suggestions. <br>
<br>
-&gt; Leave Ragefire as he is and add another, triggered mob, that is MUCH tougher to complete the quest. Make said mob level 62 or so and require 4 good groups to kill (or more if you must), as opposed to Ragefire who has been done by 6 level 60s. <br>
<br>
-&gt; If possible, change the level necessary to use the epic to 56. While a nice benefit to lower level Clerics to get the 56 res, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me that those Clerics should be able to first actually cast the spell before using the effect off a piece of equipment. Very very rarely can someone use an effect of an item that casts a spell higher in level than the player is currently. While many would cry nerf, it seems like a reasonable nerf and would, temporarily at least, reduce the competition for Ragefire. <br>
<br>
-&gt;Maybe make Ixiblat Fer tougher. Again, very high level players can take him down quite easily and with small numbers. For lower level players (say 55 and under) he is quite the monster, but these days it's trivial to gather the forces necessary to kill him.<br>
<br>
-&gt;Make the Plasmatic Priest significantly tougher. Can do him with three players easily (probably with 2, Cleric/Monk). <br>
<br>
I'm not certain that the suggestions above are worthwhile or even workable within the design vision. However, they are just my attempts at possible solutions that might allow more Epics to enter the game while balancing that somewhat with increased difficulty. Unlike many other epics, the Cleric epic is extremely easy and the only real bottlenecks are the rare spawns. I find it difficult to believe that Verant intentionally designed the Cleric epic quest to be so easy to get to the last step only to have literally dozens (if not hundreds) of Clerics stuck at the final bottleneck. Add that to the item having an effect that is in huge demand by guilds who do raids and it seems like a guaranteed formula for strife. <br>
<br>
I thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon. <br>

<br>
The bottleneck at Ragefire would not be reduced by your first suggestion, unless you are proposing that we take that step out. As I said, I'm all for making this quest much harder, especially considering that this is by far the most sought after epic in the game.<br>
<br>
Putting a level limit on the item is sort of contrary to the way things have been done. But I can see the value in it.<br>
<br>
Ixiblat Fer, or the Plasmatic Priest, or any other NPC in this quest getting stronger works fine for me. But it won't reduce the alleged 50 clerics waiting behind the Ragefire spawn…<br>
<br>
In any case, I'll bring all of this to the team. We are exceedingly reluctant to mess around with these epic quests. We could spend the rest of our days farting around with them and never make then perfect. So don't expect a change. Only know that I'll make certain the team sees your concerns.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
I wrote all of that last week. Today we had a Tuning meeting that was mostly about this particular issue.<br>
<br>
First, we can't be changing epic quests all the time to make them fit the current game. Just like any other content, these quests will get easier as time passes and players get higher level, better items and all that.<br>
<br>
The bottleneck here is caused almost exclusively by the massive volume of Clerics and their guilds and friends and friends of friends helping them and urging (or insisting) that the get this item. The only solution to that would be to nerf the item, make it less desirable so that fewer people will be insisting that Clerics have this item. We've decided not to do that.<br>
<br>
There are no other changes that we can make to this quest that would not simply be making the quest harder or more tedious. We've learned from past experience that making the quest harder would probably not reduce the bottleneck. Making more bottlenecks earlier in the quest would be considered a nerf, but is the only solution to reducing the bottleneck at Ragefire. While this is a perfectly viable solution, adjusting these quests all the time isn't something we want to do, since the difficulty of these quests will change as players and characters advance (constantly), and we're not planning on playing catchup all the time this way.<br>
<br>
So, the answer is, no. We are not going to change the Cleric epic quest. The problem doesn't really lie in the quest (except perhaps that it is too easy), it lies in the desirability of the item and the vast number of people trying to get it (or help others get it).<br>
