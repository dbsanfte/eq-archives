<br>
The cold waves lashed against the shore as the creatures of the night called to each other beyond the boundaries of the city.  The large beast rose from the hardwood floor carefully avoiding the bowls of herbs from the previous day's work as he sauntered out onto the docks.  No one stirred as he made his way down the planks and began walking along the shore.<br>
<br>
The visits were becoming more frequent.<br>
<br>
Since Jelen had laid rest the mystery of the Ashiir's in the City of Mist, and received the great spear that had once torn the fabric of existance itself, his visits with the spirits had become a near daily occurance.  Some, great King's of the past seeking answers to the demise of their kingdom, others just common peasants from long ago who suffered great wrongs and were seeking amends.  Another one called to him this evening, he knew he would not find slumber until he answered this one.<br>
<br>
He was growing too old for this.<br>
<br>
He moved his thoughts to his black fur boots and immediately felt the surge of speed.  He broke into a full run, enjoying the wind ruffling through his fur as he ran toward the beacon.  This spirit was strong, drawing him as if the Tribunal themselves had snatched him up with invisible hands.  What really bothered him was the sense of familiarity.  This was different.<br>
<br>
&quot;Figures .. why do you metaphysical types always make things difficult for me,&quot; he muttered to himself as he came upon the giant's camp.  The three of them were sharing jokes around a keg of ale.  It appeared the object of his attraction was within one of their tents.  Typical.<br>
<br>
The air around him crackled as the spirits shrouded him with their protective magics.  Feeling the reassuring barrier around him he stepped forward.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello friends, I don't suppose you've heard of King Tormax?  See, him and I are good friends .. and I was just wondering ..&quot;  That's all he got out before they charged him screaming literary marvels like, &quot;Kill .. smash .. destroy!&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, here we go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking a couple steps back he pointed a finger at the closest one and with a flash of green luminescence the grass around the giant's feet took on a life of its own and rooted him on the spot.  The second one bearing down on him, Jelen took his own initiative to charge - slamming a large white shoulder into his groin.  As the second giant screamed in pain Jelen was knocked to the ground by the third who had come up right behind his ally.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm really getting too old for this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The air crackled with frost as the giant charged.  As he drew closer one could see his breath even though it was in the middle of summer.  Jelen patiently waited, idly wondering why these fellas couldn't be more sensible like the new world giants.  As the giant swung his mighty fist his eyes flew open in shock.  Too late.  The screech of pain was deafening as the giant was torn apart by shards of ice.<br>
<br>
The other two looked at him with wide eyes then took off running for their lives.<br>
<br>
When he entered the tent he fell to his knees and began to weep.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've grown, Jelen.  I never imagined my own son would become a great Heyokah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jelen slowly raised his head to take in the vision.  It had been over 50 years since he had last seen him.  He'd worked all his life to remove that image from his mind, yet here his father was whole .. not lying in a pool of blood so large you wondered how it came out of one person, nor were his intestines adorning the walls of the tent like some sick decoration.<br>
<br>
He could only weep.  He didn't know what to say.  Everything he had done in his life he had done for this man.  There were so many things he wanted to say but he had no idea where to start.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you've grown fond of your newfound ability to take on the spirit of the Great Bear.&quot;<br>
<br>
He hadn't realized it, he returned to his native form &quot;It helps me sleep..&quot;<br>
<br>
A moment of silence passes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've felt a great void in the strength of your spirit, son; you used to be so vital and hungry for adventure.  What brings you this sorrow and saps your strength so?&quot;  Jel looked down on him with hard gray eyes.<br>
<br>
Jelen took a deep breath, trying to clear his thoughts, &quot;I'm growing old, father.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jelen, you have spent much of your life alone, yes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes father, through most of my time in Norrath I have only had a guardian spirit by my side in my travels.  The people who roam the lands are not all wise in the ways you have taught me.  They feel that material possessions are more important than good friends by their side.  Though greed is abundant, good does roam the lands -- I have found more greed than good though, that has been a large variable in my solo pursuits as it pains my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yet you have found friends in the realm of life?  Those who shun greed?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Evoluxa is my only family, father- they have helped me to achieve everything I hold valuable in my life: patience, trust, loyalty, pride, honor .. I owe them everything - they gave me my life back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So you are no longer alone then, what is troubling you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Jelen lowered his head, not really sure of the answer himself.  He felt the heat from his father's spirit as he laid an arm around his broad shoulders.  Jelen glanced up into his fathers warm face, tears streaming down his cheeks.  Jel smiled at his son knowingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;She cares for you son, and I know you share the sentiment - she frequents your thoughts.  Don't let this pass you by like so many other things.  It is time to stop pushing away those who show feelings for you, take them into your heart.  I've always forgiven you son, please stop blaming yourself for my passing.  I'm so proud of you, set yourself free to enjoy the true gifts of life.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jelen embraced his father and wept openly into his shoulder.  He had waited his whole life to hear those words.<br>
<br>
After what seemed like an eternity had passed, a pinprick of light appeared in midair behind his father.  It shot to the ground streaming a shaft of light behind it.  The light expanded to reveal shadows in a milky haze beyond.  His father stepped into the tear and looked at Jelen again with his dark gray eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be well my son, Heyokah of Halas.  Her song will flourish in your soul if you open yourself to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jelen gazed into the light, trying to remember every detail of his father's face through the sheen of tears.  Standing behind his father he could make out the faint image of Erollisi Marr; she was smiling.  He wondered to himself what a Goddess would be doing in the spirit realm - and then all was silent.<br>
<br>
He slept.   <p><p align="center"><img src="http://jelen.homestead.com/
