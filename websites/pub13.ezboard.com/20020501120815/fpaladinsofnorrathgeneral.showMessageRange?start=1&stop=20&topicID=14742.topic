I wonder which make the better paladin stats wise beside that fact that the highelf has more wis do the high lvl human paladin find that you run out of mana faster or about the same a regular caster? Does the high lvl high elf paladins find that at high lvl they wis meets the cap but they still are unable to get up their melee stats with DW or better gear ? I just want to hear the thing that High lvl Human Paladin and High lvl High Elf Paladin have to say and what they find is diffrent between the two races, is it hard to go through life not being able to see at night or is it easy to get things for this problem. I Thank you for the time you put into your reply and Hope you are able to share what you have learn over the last few lvls thanks all for you help.look forward to hearing what you have to say and what do you think is the more common paladin The human or the high elf and why I hate being things that are common. Have you High lvl paladin find it hard to getting into ahgih lvl group or do you think that guild at high lvl need paladin on raid cause I see that each High lvl guild on my sever has a few paladin and like two SKs max . Also what is are class armor after DW ? and does anyone know the Female AA titles? NM on titles I just saw them a few post down, But over all which do you think is more common a Human pally or a high elf pally I hate playing common charcters, I also want to know is it hard to fid some sight items for humans that don't cost you a major AC slot ? or a important ring slot.<br>I am thinking human because I like their melee stats better and the look, I think that is important. Some other questions at what lvl with a good guild is the time to goget your soul fire at what lvl ? can it be done and what should I have done before they help me ? thanks all for your time you took to reply .  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utakcarus118.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Takcarus118</A> at: 3/6/02 10:09:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukidkod1ak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kidkod1ak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 10:02:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> Go dwarf.

I think Eurdin is the most uncommon Paladin race as I have never seen one nor do I know of any.  Perhaps if uncommon is what you seek, that might be the way to go.  You will have your own personal struggles no matter what race.<br><br>As a Human, My wisdom is low, 83, and I tend to cast a lot so I go oom often.  I have not gotten many items to augment the wisdom although I am starting to branch out into better equipment as plat and adventure permits.  I partner with a Cleric who gets all the best Wisdom items, of course, and we do well together.  I like the Human as there is a good balance in stats and I guess I am a human IRL so...   No stats evaluation really and I do not remember where I put my additional points.  I see many High Elves and Humans and Dwarves but to be honest, my friends are who I group with and those I have grouped with before often become my friends.  I am not High End Guild Driven so I am probably a poor source for your question about races.<br><br>I would think that the items beyond DW are the nodrops you will find after 46 in Planes and dragons but I am not sure.  I have several DW items.  I can acquire the Guants for example, but my Crust Gaunts are fine for me now but always in the market when Plat permits.   I have a couple of Spider Fur pieces and will be questing the NoDrop improved armor soon.  My BP is Ro as I quested it and will wear it until something better is available.  Ro acts as a Light Source as well.  Rarely have I had much trouble with light.  There are many sources that you can easily use.  It can be a pain but party members are typically sensitive to light problems and will cast appropriate spells if needed.  I used to carry a lightstone.....sometimes a torch....through areas I needed light and switch when needed... now I have no troubles at all.  If on a CR... not that I die or anything.... but on a Pretend CR...I cast Halo of light and get on my way.<br><br>Not being in an Super Guild I do have yet to go to the Planes and Raid Dragons or anything so my simple experience has lead me through Norrath and Luclin on Average Gear I suppose.<br><br>Soulfire I started around 30ish I suppose.  I did all the running around and faction building and my small guild raided MM one day.  We were fortunate to have the hilt drop within a reasonable time period.  We all got XP while there so it was not a burden on my friends.  One day, a friend said lets Do Lucan.  It was New Years Day and we mustered up about 7 people to help.  There was a friend who was a 50+ Paladin who tanked the most but we all whopped on him.  Unfortunately one friend is now KoS and didn't want to be but that was the only downfall.  A Good Druid and I made our way to the Good Brother Hayle and Soulfire was mine at around level 36.  You should read up and start when you are motivated to do so.  I have since participated in killing Lucan again which was a Pick Up group near EC.  There was a Shout and several people were happy to help. <br><br><br>Bah   Rambling now....<br><br>Just my 2cp<br><br>Daviur<br>46 Paladin<br>Luclon<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uharriefu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HarrieFU</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 1:00:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> &lt;---only 60 female dwarf on bristlebane!<br><br>stamina is a huge stat at 60 so dwarves are great! <br><br>we're also cute! *nods*<br><br>Harrie Fuzzybottom 60 crusader of Brell<br>Club FU<br>BB <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uevildunn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EvilDunn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.evildunn.com/images/eye_10x10.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 1:13:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.evildunn.com/images/dunn_ezboard.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> <br>&lt;---- erudite pally on tarew marr.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table align=right><tr><td><a href="http://www.evildunn.com">Dunn</a></tt></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulordgop.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Gop</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 2:25:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> Thats all good replys but I have a question for the humans and the HE if your a high elf at high lvls 50 plus do you find it hard to get items that give you good melee stas STR and STA I know we have good wis already so thats what I like, But humans do you find that you can get wis up without getting rid of some important ac items ?

Wisdom is not as important as Stamina in the endgame but it's another one that's hard to raise but it's not necessary so its up to you really whichever race you prefer, all stats can be raised eventually with items or buffs and plus High Elves get the Nature's Defender which is a High Elf only version of the Paladin epic and it's easier so that's another advantage of playing a High Elf over a Human.  But if you want to play something really different and fun try an Erudite they have many rich roleplaying aspects as well as good starting faction in almost every city as well as Deepwater Knight faction that you will need someday when you do your epic , (the 7 main stats are not as important to a Paladin as they are to a Druid cause eventually someday you will find yourself concentrating on HP and AC except when youre soloing and want more wisdom)),.~ <p><font color="0000aa"><h5>Vladimirr D'Benefiece<br>Officer, Order of the White Dragon<br>Deepwater Knight<br>In Service of our Good and Gracious Oceanlord, Prexus<br>Bristlebane Server<br><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17434">Click here for equipment listing</a><br></h5></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvladimirrdbenefiece.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vladimirr DBenefiece</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.execpc.com/~jwnrski/shield.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/6/02 2:44:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udunthorwarsmith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunthor Warsmith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 3:01:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> From my experience, the race distribution is:<br>Common - Human, high elf<br>Uncommon - dwarf, half elf<br>Rare - Erudite<br><br>My combat wis is 101, which at lvl 43 means about 5-7 GHeals if things go really bad.  Prior to 39, when we got GHeal, I generally found I had a pretty good amount of mana to work with, including for healing.  Since getting GHeal, that's the only thing that really makes me wish for a lot more mana - otherwise I'd say I'm doing alright.<br><br>STR you can get up pretty high, even on a budget, if you're patient.  I'm 43, untwinked and my gear is pretty much all self-earned or self-bought, and I have +77str in items for combat wear (I'm a str junkie).<br><br>One thing to be concerned about is AGI though.  Make sure to spend enough points at creation to get that to 75, so as to avoid the AC hit.  I'm not sure which races this is a worry for, but I know it is for dwarves.<br><br>All stats can be corrected through gear.  Its just mostly a question of &quot;inate benifits&quot; from your racial stats, what is personally important to you, and how much time/plat you will put into those &quot;stat corrections&quot;.  I mostly hear 50+ paladins complaining about/seeking WIS and STA, which would place High Elves and Dwarves as the &quot;best&quot; races from a stat perspective, respectively, I believe.<br><br>Its really about choosing the race that has the attributes you like most.  No race really outclasses the rest, nor is any exorbitantly far behind.  They're all pretty close, just very different. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lavasoul>Lavasoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 3:39:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> I'm a level 60 High Elf Paladin and I love to cast. I buff everyone I meet and when grouping up I help the cleric with heals to save them mana. When there's no cleric I play healer and also tank. When I first created him i put 15 points into stre and 5 in dex. Wisdom for High Elf is good but if you want more it doesn't hurt. If I had a chance to change on how I start off my pally I would have put 10 to str and 10 to sta. I'm mostly in guardian armor and only have 2 planar piece.

Of the 7 paladins in my old guild, 5 were Human and 2 were High-Elf. Human is a decent choice and is what I chose. Mainly because all of their stats are pretty even across the board and you can start in Qeynos, which is a prime spot for leveling a newb. My wis as a Human is 174, so Humans don't really fall far behind a High-Elf in that department.<br><br>The best choice though is still a Dwarf. If I could change my race right now to Dwarf I would. If you want to play a really uncommon race just for kicks, go Erudite. They suck royally for starting stats, but you don't see many of them around. In fact, in 2 years I've only ever seen 2 on my server. <p><BR><BR><A HREF=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77809"><B>Whitefyre Nobleheart</B></A><BR><B><FONT FACE="Old English Text MT, Arial">Paladin of the 60th Light</FONT></B><BR>If I were an Autobot, I'd be:<br><a href="http://android5.com/misc/tests"><img border=0    src="http://android5.com/misc/tests/autobot/ironhide.gif"  alt="Click to see what Autobot you could be!"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzimelaotl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zimel Aotl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 10:57:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> I'm a highelf and am loving it.  Love having as much wisdom as I do compared to the human paladins in my guild in full tank gear.  They have to switch out to mana gear to get close to my mana / wisdom that i have in full tank gear heh, losing some ac and other vital stats.  My strength in regular tank gear is at 210 so im not really missing the low strength that we start wtih heh.  Usually on high end raids all my melee stats are all around 255, and my wisdom can get up to 200 easily, so, all in all, it really doesnt matter, Eye sight wont matter if your really in the high end game, a lot of high end items give good vision stuff, example being Truesight, etc.  Being a newbie tho, would go high elf for the sight, its a pain being a human at dark for the first half of the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhyprionthecrusader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hyprion The Crusader</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 11:02:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14742.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins where are ?</span><hr size=1> Will you marry me Harrie?

I don't like to solo very much, I miss the company of a good group when I do. So when you don't solo you don't really need a big ammount of mana. I don't anyway, never run OOM. The spells I use are not that expensive on mana (ION, DM, VoM, Ciese, Desist, CC) and if you sit your ass down inbetween all fights you'll be fine.<br><br>Also remeomber, more mana makes you have to sit down longer instead of more often. In the end you still have to sit down to regen the used mana. More wis doesn't make the mana come back faster. Where more AC does make you lose it less fast.<br><br>Personally I'd pick a human every time. dorfs are the best paladins stat wise (IMO) but look at them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (no offence guys) Then again, elves get the ND, wich makes up their lower stats a great deal I guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Oh and female titels are: Baroness, Lady, Duchess for AA exp. regular level titels are just like male, Cavelier, Knight, Crusader.

Makes a big difference whether you can get off 3 or 4 HWoP in an AoE fight! But all stats can be worked on, so basically you should just choose the race that fits you best.
