I've got about $150 (plus or minus 50 or so) to throw around these days, and I was wondering what the general advice on new video cards is. I'm probably going to end up gradually piecing together a whole new system over the next few months, so another question: Are AMD k7's and AGP Vid cards having problems working together? (I heard this somewhere, not sure where).<br>
<br>
What are you all using, and how do you like it? Currently I have a voodoo3 2000 PCI 16meg card, and that's fine, but my entire system is a little low and needs to be upgraded (Currently using a PII 300, 256mb RAM, Win2k/Linux Dual boot). If I build a new one, I don't want the video card to be the botttle neck, so I'll want to up it to a 32 meg or 64 meg card anyways. Probably a 32 meg card seeing how much ca$h I have.<br>
<br>
What say youse?<br>

<br>
the only options that you have in that price range would be ati cards, geforce 2 MX cards, or the kryo 2 cards.  the ati cards in my mind are not a viable choice with the fact that you will have agony getting other games running.  if eq is the only game you play you may not have much problem.<br>
<br>
the geforce 2 mx is not a bad chipset overall, however it is a different chipset from the true geforce 2 and runs on the same driver set as the tnt on up to geforce 3...sometimes has some display errors, but not near the compatibility problems of ati cards.<br>
<br>
the kryo 2 is a fast chipset, but very lacking in 3D.  still very new, and does not support hardware T&amp;L, so you will seeing more of a bottleneck even in EQ when Luclin comes out.<br>
<br>
in my opinion, keep the money you have and save until you can afford a true geforce 2, or better yet, a geforce 3.<br>
<br>
also, the problems with K7s and AGP video cards mainly only applies to a specific chipset.  the VIA Apollo Pro KT133.  the problems are generally fixed with an AGP miniport driver update, called the 4-in-1 drivers.  Personally, i'm staying away from this chipset, just because there are known problems and i want a stable system.  if you want to go the AMD way, AMD has what appears to be a very solid chipset for some motherboards called the 761 chipset.  the only drawback on this is the fact that you need DDR ram.<br>
<br>
currently i have 2 systems..saving for a new processor and video card, but:<br>
<br>
1:  celeron 533, intel 815 based mobo, 256 megs of ram, tnt2 ultra, sblive<br>
<br>
2:  celeron 366a, 440bx based mobo, 128 megs of ram, tnt1, vortex 2 <p>Marikus Khayman<BR>

<br>
At resolutions above 800x600, the video card will almost always be the bottleneck (or at least part of it); it's just a matter of getting the fastest one you can find.  If you only have $150, a GeForce2 MX based card is probably the way to go.  Note that video memory size won't have much of an effect on performance, as that is really a function of the chipset on the card. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucaptinjakbal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captin Jakbal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/4/01 7:02:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Video Card Advice . . .</span><hr size=1> <br>
I'll be honest. While I do know about some computer hardware, I know nothing about Video Cards at all. I thought that Memory was the defining factor as to how well a Vid card performed, but now that I think about it that really doesn't make any sense. Thanks for your response there.<br>

As for the effect of video memory size, the closest analogy I can think of is to CPU L2 cache size.  While more can offer greater performance in certain circumstances, you reach a point of greatly diminishing returns.  What's really important is the processor driving the video card (how fast it can process 3D commands), and the bandwidth of the memory and interface (how fast it can move data).  In any case, once you reach 32 Mb, it's certainly not the most critical aspect of the video card. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzanesatana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zane Satana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/5/01 2:41:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.arctos.org/ubb/avatars/Lain02.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Video Card Advice . . .</span><hr size=1> Anandtech > Tom's Hardware. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucaptinjakbal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captin Jakbal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/12/01 9:10:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Video Card Advice . . .</span><hr size=1> <br>
When I was talking about good cards for about $150 it is because I've seen a lot of ads like these: <a href="http://shop.guillemot.com/cgi-bin/hercules.filereader?3b2656780ed72d7427410ac7675006af+EN/products/4766041">An Advertisement</a> that seemed like pretty good cards. I've read good things about Hercules before, but I'll admit I still haven't done enough research.<br>
<br>
Just letting you guys know what I had been thinking previously.<br>
<br>
On another note: got another question about telephone lines ... if you have any idea on that type of thing. My question is as follows: I have two ISP's. It seems that every 7.5 minutes or so my lag goes from a respectable 0% with about a 400 server ping to a not so respectable 90+% and a very red server ping reading in the thousands. This happens independent of ISP, or whether or not I'm moving. It'll happen if I'm meditating, or grouping, or kiting.<br>
<br>
Now I said every 7.5 minutes, but what I mean by that is it happens frequently. I haven't timed it out or anything. Sometimes the lag percentage doesn't go up but the server ping goes up and then comes down after a few minutes. Also: I go link dead about once every 1/2 hour if I'm lucky.<br>
<br>
Because of this, I only play rarely and I am forced into solo'ing if I'm playing from home. I'm solo'ing in Burning Woods on Hornets ... so at least its easy.<br>
<br>
Now my question: Does this sound like perhaps a problem with my computer, my phone line, my head, or the world in general? I'd suggest it was a problem with my ISP but I've tried it consistently on 2, and tested it briefly on another 2 in addition to that.<br>
<br>
Any advice?<br>
<br>

Also, when you pick a small player in the 3D market, you are risking the company going out of business, which means no driver support.<br>
<br>
Remember that with nVidia-based video cards, the performance is in the chipset, not the actual construction of the card.  Many of the video card manufacturers build nVidia-based boards, and they perform identically at their base clock speed.  Some manufacturers build extra features (like a TV-out), or use faster-then-spec memory (allowing better overclocking), or use a different heatsink/fan (potentially reducing heat and allowing better overclocking), but when it comes down to it, they're all about the same.  The main difference is the PCB (board) color:  Hercules uses a deep blue, Gainward uses a sharp red, Asus uses a bland beige, and so forth.<br>
<br>
If you want the fewest headaches and best level of overall performance, you should probably go with a GeForce2 MX based card (around $150), which, when overclocked, can perform about as well as a GeForce 2.  I know Gainward produces an MX-based card with special low-latency memory, which makes the card so overclocking-friendly that Gainward even provides some sort of overclocking guarantee in the form of an enhanced mode.<br>
<br>
The other budget option would be ATI's latest Raedon (I forget the exact name, I'm not an ATI fan), which lags behind in performance but is very cheap. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0> at: 6/18/01 5:18:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucaptinjakbal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Captin Jakbal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/19/01 8:50:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Video Card Advice . . .</span><hr size=1> <br>

Memory has always made a difference for me.. But then I went from a 4MB card that couldn't even load all the EQ textures to the 32MB card.  There might not be as big a difference from 16 ro 32...  *shrug* <p><table width=%20>
