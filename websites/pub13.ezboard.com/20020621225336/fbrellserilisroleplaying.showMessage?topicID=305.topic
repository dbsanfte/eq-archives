He had been invited to a military conference by the Storm Giants. Zirrix had performed many tasks and services to the citizens of Kael, and was now considered an ally by both the Strom and Frost Giants. Only the faction of King Tormax himself still regarded him with threatening glares whenever he ventured too close to the King’s Hall. But, that would soon change. Zirrix had been spending time on a mission of special import to the King himself. Zirrix understood and respected the deep hatred and contempt with which the Giants of Kael viewed the Coldain of Thurgadin. It was the Natural Order of things that such feelings would be the driving force in the survival and success of any race. With this in mind, Zirrix had set out on a series of extermination raids against the Coldain. Even while his brother, Tzlar, had cultivated an alliance with the Dwarves and Dragons of Velious, Zirrix cemented his position with the Giants of the Frozen Continent. That is why he attended the meeting now being held, to co-ordinate his efforts with those of the Giant regiments in the Eastern Wastes and Great Divide. With each Coldain head Zirrix presented to the Captain of the Guard, his favor grew in the eyes of the King. But, the King was a slayer of Dragons, so Zirrix would have to execute many, many Coldain before he would be permitted in the King’s presence. That did not deter him, in fact, it only filled him with a sense of satisfaction. Zirrix was battling the enemies of the Great God of Battle, Rallos Zek, within sight of the mighty being’s Temple. In time, the King would see Zirrix not as a supplicant, but as a representative of the Teir’dal Empire and fellow servant of their shared God. As the meeting ended, Zirrix was invited to drink with his Storm and Frost Giant allies and tell the tales of his battles.<br>
<br>
Over bottles of Kalish, which was all Zirrix would drink in memory and tribute to the Red Hand, he told the stories of his time in the Eastern wastes. He told of his attack and destruction of the Coldain camp located to the North of the Great Bridge. He told of slaughtering the occasional Orc Centurion, who was foolish enough to challenge the Dark Elven Warrior. He also presented his hosts with several Snow Cougar pelts of the best quality as gifts. Along with those, were the talons of Snow Griffons and Mammoth and Giant Walrus ivory. The pelts were used for robes and garments of finery. The talons were ground up, and used as medicines and curatives. The ivory polished, bejeweled, and formed into items of beauty and great value.     The best prizes, the battered and bloodied heads of the Coldain Warriors and Hunters he killed in battle, he presented to the Captain of the city guard personally. There were many nods of appreciation as Zirrix related his battles. He told of tactics and time, of frost and wind, of solitude and victory. Throughout the night he, and his Kael allies, drank and listened to songs of combat, honor, success and glorious death. All knowing that somewhere, beyond the realm of mere mortals, did Rallos Zek sit on his Throne of War and drink along with them.   <br>
