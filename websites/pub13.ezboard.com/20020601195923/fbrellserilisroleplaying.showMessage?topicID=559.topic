Hot sheets of rain pelted the lone traveling woman's face like the sting of a hard fisted slap. She pulled her cloak around her body a little tighter to protect her from the Thundergod's namesake element.<br>
<br>
It had been two weeks of traveling on foot, and although barely clothed except for a pair of boots and a long full body hooded cloak, she made excellent progress for her conditions.<br>
Noone had questioned her as she appeared in the fungus caverns wearing nothing but the cloak she took off the woman's body she took after, nor did the freeport militia give her a second glance when she strode past the guards, heavy with the scent of death.<br>
<br>
Things had changed, and drastically. She looked up at the moon, where she was entombed years ago to prevent from ever awakening and walking the soils of Norrath again. The moon barely shone through the dark grey clouds, but the eyes this woman had were strong, not like the fading eyesight of her old body. This body was youthful, strong, well shaped and stunningly beautiful, with a thick mane of jet black hair - uncommon for a high elf. <br>
<br>
She remembered the time when she was at the hieght of her power, standing before the burning walls of Felwithe and the hundreds of bodies that had fallen trying to defend thier home. She remembered the sheer power she felt from each life she took, and every soul she drank gave pushed her lust for power further and further, creating an endless cycle of death and greed. She was unwillingly brought back to life as one of the Nasferatu, a walking undead but intelligent, or more commonly known as a Vampire. Her name, Fenye, became synonymous with dread, suffering, and woe.<br>
Now she walked the lands again as a mortal, and without a shred of wealth.<br>
<br>
Her journey came to a close when she reached the dark caverns of the Splitpaw tribe, close to the city of Qeynos. She hid in a dark corner and awaited until a lone gnoll wandered close, then sprung on him like a hungry plant closes it's bud on an unsuspecting insect. With the gnoll's neck broken and the body limp, she reached for it's dagger and began to skin it.<br>
The bloody hide would at least provide warmth for a little while so she could traverse the snowy lands of the Everfrost peaks and finally come to the one she knew who could restore her fully.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you see where she is heading now?&quot; a wizard asked, peering fervently into a scrying globe. Wizards had been watching Fenye for the sun's full rotation, day after day, and each day she got closer to thier allies in Freeport. But every city she passed through she bothered noone, never gave them a second glance, and bore no ill intentions. But they all remembered the creature she was in past times, and should she even come close to the power she was before, she would have to be eliminated.<br>
&quot;She is preparing to head into the Everfrost peaks, to what reason I do not know. Perhaps she has some small fortune stowed away there.&quot; another wizard responded.<br>
Several other archmages paced the room, awaiting some sign that would show her intentions for traveling this far. They all knew of the dragon, Vox, who resided in the caves of Permafrost, but the dragon would have no words with any mortal. They knew of the giants that kept the keep of the Dragon well guarded, and they too, would attack on sight. And surely an unarmed elf such as Fenye would pose no problem for them to remove. The barbarians of the north did not care for the actions of the elves, although they were of good and just heart. There was no place for her in thier city.<br>
&quot;Miragul.&quot; muttered yet another wizard in a stale tone. &quot;She has come to see Miragul.&quot;<br>
&quot;He's been dead for hundreds of years I thought. His existence is but a legend!&quot;<br>
&quot;You are correct, he *is* dead. A lich. And a very powerful one. Fenye has kept something of his for a long time, and he would do anything for it back.&quot;<br>
&quot;What could this naked woman covered in a bloody gnoll's hide possibly have that a lich as powerful as Miragul would want so badly?&quot;<br>
The wizard lowered his head, closing his eyes in a synchronous motion, &quot;His own phylactery. His soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Yes, this is the place, Fenye thought to herself as she traced a finger along the frozen rock walls of the Everfrost plains. There was a secret cave built in here, illusioned so that the entrance was impossible to detect with the naked eye, but could still be passable if you knew exactly where it was. Suddenly her finger slipped into the rock as if it were made of air, and she stepped inside, instantly greeted by warmth.<br>
<br>
The cave was well lit, despite the lack of a light source, and it radiated with powerful magic of long forgotten arcane sciences. She had been here once before, many years ago, to battle this same lich, and as her prize she took his own soul, forever trapping him in this dismal place to rot for all eternity.<br>
&quot;Awaken, sleeping one. I have returned.&quot; echoed Fenye in her most powerful and stern voice. Her new body sounded different than her old one, and getting used to her own voice was something she had not quite gotten familiar with yet.<br>
She heard a scraping, such as that of bone against rock, then a long winded, voice hissed and whispered back at her, &quot;My ssssoul... I sssmell it... give it.. back&quot;<br>
&quot;You'll not have it until I get what I want, Lich. But you have my word that you shall once again resume your thirst for knowledge and power.&quot; The lich came into view, as horridly smelling as he was looking. The years had let his body fall apart without the magic of his phylactery, and without his own soul his body decayed just as normal as any body does after death. He limped his way out of the darker parts of the cave and towards the stout elf.<br>
Cocking his head to one side produced ghastly cracking sounds, and he asked &quot;What do you ... why have you come here again, elf? What isss it you want from me?&quot;<br>
Fenye closed her eyes and quickly summoned what seemed a solid form of his soul, a glowing vial of swirling blue magic that resembled smoke caught in a windstorm. She held the vial out in the palm of her hand, snatching it away as the lich tried to grab it. He could not harm her as long as she had this, for it would mean his death as well. His soul was bonded with her soul until she freely gave it away.<br>
&quot;No doubt you have felt the magic of late. The nexus portals around the world have generated an enormous fluxation of mana, and it was this that awoke me. I want to use this power for my own benefit, but I have to use you first. I do not wish to attemp this as a mortal.&quot;<br>
&quot;You wisssh to become.. asss I? Are you that much of a fool, young elf?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not likely. I've no desire to return to a state of undeath. I've seen hell more times than I've seen my own face, and to be honest, those in the spirit world are starting to know me by name now. I'm going to stay with the living, and be one myself. But not as a mortal.&quot;<br>
&quot;I ssssee... you wish to have the powerssss of the undead, but remain assss the living do.. I have attempted thissss ssspell but once, and it failed,&quot;the lich writhed his creaking limbs as he anticipated the dream of having his soul back, &quot;I would need my ssssoul back to accomplissssh thisss feat of magical fortitude. You will have to... trussst me,&quot; he hissed with a dry chuckle.<br>
Fenye clenched her fist around the vial that contained his soul, &quot;You should fear me, Lich. I am no fool to be toyed with. There have been scores of foes more powerful than you ever were that fell before me. Think of this when you have your soul back. When the deal is done, you are free to go. Do you understand?&quot;<br>
Miragul reared back disgusted that he had no real power anymore, and had no choice other than to accept her terms or never have his soul back.<br>
&quot;Very well... prepare yourself elf.&quot;<br>
Miragul stood up to his full hieght, getting taller and more straight with every sickening pop of his back. His bones wavered under the change of weight, but he remained standing. In a few moments, greenish wisps of mana began seeping through the open holes in his body, circling around him and reaching out to touch Fenye like the tentacles of a hungry octopus.<br>
When the first wisp touched her, she tensed up her body as if she had been struck by a powerful bolt of lightening, and a choking moan escaped her mouth. Her cloak and hide fell to the floor, bearing herself before the lich, but in his undeath he felt no desire of the flesh in that manner. Her muscles were so tight by the strain of magical energy that they fiberlated like an unstable plate of jelly, giving the impression that something was moving under her own skin. <br>
After a few moments, her body loosedened up and started to levitate a few inches off the cavern floor, but she was reduced to an unconcious state. Fenye hovered limply, as the strains of mana seeped in through every oraface of her body, pumping her with the magic that would end her life as a mortal and begin it anew as a demigod. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unuthilyantalvaros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NuthilyanTalvaros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/7/02 4:50:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://212.212.159.240/wolf/imagesP/wolfh.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rebirth of Undeath pt.2</span><hr size=1> Nuthilyan looked first at the wizard, then to the small sketch in his hand, then back to the wizard again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me get this straight.&quot; he said to the robed man &quot;You want me to trail this semi-naked elven woman through the northern wastes, see what she is doing and report back to you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The wizard nodded<br>
<br>
&quot;And what makes you think that i would even consider helping you human? I have enough elven lasses waiting for me in kelethin and neriak, far closer and much warmer than the tundra of everfrost.&quot; handing the sketch back to the wizard he put his hands on the pommel of his axe. &quot;Why should i trek halfway across the continent to aid the likes of you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The wizard looked at him for a long while in silence, then spoke &quot;Because her coming might herald the doom of this world. You surely are not feebleminded master halfling, what do you think would happen to you should a god walk on norrath and begin slaughtering innocents?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuthilyan smirked at the spellcaster &quot;I still do not see any reason why i should help you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing the wizard reached into his robes and pulled out a small bag, there was a metallic clinking from within. &quot;My order has allowed me to offer you ten thousand peices of platinum for your services.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nuthilyan took the bag, peered inside of it breifly and stuffed it into his pack. &quot;You my fingerwiggling friend have bought yourself a master tracker. Is there anything i should know about this lass?&quot;<br>
<br>
The wizard stared intently down into the ranger's eyes. &quot;Only that she could be extremely dangerous, excersise caution.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nodding slightly Nuthilyan bowed to the robed man and ran off into the west. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of Discord</span><br>  Posts: 2541<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 7:08:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rebirth of Undeath pt.2</span><hr size=1> hey! don't add to my story! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unuthilyantalvaros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NuthilyanTalvaros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/8/02 2:56:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Why not?</span><hr size=1> /ooc why not? i find its always more fun to roleplay WITH people other than just by yourself, no worries tho, you dont like i wont add <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Queen of Discord</span><br>  Posts: 2545<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/10/02 8:41:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why not?</span><hr size=1> good, cuz there is no way in hell I'd let a halfling snoop follow me :P<br>
