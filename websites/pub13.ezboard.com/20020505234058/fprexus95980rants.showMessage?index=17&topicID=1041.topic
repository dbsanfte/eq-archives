I did a test on coffeemakers about a year ago, maybe longer, and posted my results here. The temperature of the two coffee makers we have here were within 5 or so degrees of the alleged temperature of the McDonald's coffee machine.<br>

<br>
The story presented by a firm of lawyers (who obviously have a vested interest in people continuing to take such litigation), is questionable at best.<br>
<br>
For example - of the 700 cases sited of other coffee burn incidents, how many were actually investigated?  700 sounds like a lot and adds considerable emotive value to the arguement, but if they were never investigated, how do we truly know the cause?<br>
<br>
Another issue - how many times prior to the incident had the plaintiff bought coffee from McDonald's?  Had she previously noted the high temperature and, if so, why did she not take appropriate precautions for her safety, knowing that she was dealing with a potentially harmful substance?<br>
<br>
This may well have been addressed (indeed I would have to assume that it was), but no mention of these details are made in the emotive and clearly biased "summation" presented in that link.<br>
<br>
As soon as that "summation" made reference to matters that were not fact (the details of the 700 other reported incidents), it was clear that it had a major agenda and bias.  It didn't make for a good reference.<br>

I took about an hour of my time to test the plaintiff's claims, and found them lacking.<br>
<br>
I'm not a lawyer, not even a scientist, but I do subscribe to the scientific method of basically testing things for myself. Having worked at McD's for a thousand years (it seems) and calibrating those stupid coffee machines once a week (along with all the other equipment), I just didn't believe that McD's coffee machines brewed coffee higher than normal. I also remember how many times customers brought their coffee back complaining that it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  too cold</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> after being served from a fresh properly calibrated pot. I decided to do my own research.<br>
<br>
I found that skin can scald as low as 100 degrees (I went to various ask a doc sites and asked my own doctor). I found that at least two home coffee makers (Mr. Coffee and Krups) brewed coffee at around 175-180. McD's has for as long as I can remember printed &quot;contents may be hot&quot; on their coffee cups and pie containers. If I could find my product quality reference guides, I could see what the temp is supposed to be for the coffee machines (something that was set after tests were ran finding out what gave the best quality coffee).<br>
<br>
I'm firmly convinced that the lady is a product of our litigious society, believing she can't possibly be responsible for her own clumsiness. Because skin can scald even at temps below the 135-145 temp for &quot;normal&quot; brewers, she would have been scalded anyway.<br>
<br>
But don't take my word for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Like I said, I took only about an hour to get the info I had--my info could be flawed! I urge everyone to do their own tests on home coffee makers to see what they are brewing at. Research for yourself how skin can scald and at what temperatures.<br>

<br>
The point was mainly that the case is not some outrageous verdict - it's a very reasonable one.<br>
<br>
People too easily get caught up in what they THINK the burns were - the kind you would expect from hot coffee. They don't see the issue was the EXCESSIVE burns, because the coffee was negligently kept 20 degrees hotter than competitors and 50 degrees hotter than home makers.<br>
<br>
In a trial you have to by the evidence you have there; the evidence reported was that 185 degree coffee causes burns in 2 to 7 seconds, while home made coffee takes 60 seconds to cause the burns.<br>
<br>
Picture the damage you expect to have from spilling coffee on yourself - and now, picture pieces of your flesh hanging loose, in your groin and thighs, with skin grafts and months of painful recovery, and ask if you don't see the difference.<br>
<br>
You can debate the merits of the case from there - but the point was the story is usually told pretty incompletely. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

Learn it, live it.<br>
<br>
Too many simpletons expect someone else to pay for their mistakes.  All accidents can be prevented, acts of god/nature can't and yes Virginia there is a difference. (E.g.. spilling coffee on keyboard = accident / Tornado wiping out local trailer park = act of god/nature) <br>
<br>
I think it is not the responsibility of government to place regulations that are unnecessary or redundant.  Or for that matter allow for imbeciles to waste time and money filing what to me are frivolous lawsuits.  The woman the burnt herself with coffee v. McDonalds is just one example of stupidity married to litigiousness gone wrong.  Everyone knows coffee is hot, you ever try and take a sip of coffee fresh from the maker? damn hot stuff, don't matter if it is 135 or 185 degrees, you are still going to burn your tongue.  Is why most of us have the presence of mind to wait till it has cooled to drink from it and damn sure are going to be as cautious as we can to not spill it on ourselves or anything else for that matter.  Now if an employee had thrown it at her or spilled it on her then I could see a lawsuit being brought for maliciousness or negligence.  That was not the case, woman drove up and ordered and received the coffee and then spilled it on herself.  Who is to blame?  Her I think in that case.<br>
<br>
As for holding parent responsible for the actions of their kids, I am of two minds on that.  Firstly I do think that parents should be held responsible for their children's actions when it could endanger the lives and welfare of others. For example minor children that are allowed to use the family car, or are allowed access to fire arms.  If the child uses either of those in a fashion that places people or themselves at risk then yes I think the parents do bear responsibility because they should control the child's ability to use them.  By allowing the child to use such an item the parent is in effect saying "I trust my child's judgement and ability to use <item>".  In the case of motor vehicles the parents are already taking on added responsibilities in the form of increased insurance rates etc. so no new legislation is warranted.  Fire arms are another matter entirely, no insurance that covers "accidents" is widely available.  Therefore some form of legislation would seem to be warranted to hold the guardians legally and financially responsible for the actions of their minor children when those actions involve fire arms.  (Sidenote: if you have guns and kids, invest in a gunsafe and keep your fire arms locked up and unloaded at all times.  Personal defense weapons can be equipped with trigger locks etc.  Also get ahold of your local gun club or NRA rep and enroll yourself and kids in gun safety and awareness classes.)<br>
 <br>
As for fining parents because little Tommy didn't wear a helmet while out on his first 2-wheeler......what a load of @#%$.<br>
Yes bicycle helmets save lives, my brother was in an accident involving him on his mountain bike and a teen in driving a car, she said she didn't see him.  He went flying a good 15 feet when she hit him while she was supposedly doing the posted speed limit of 25 MPH.....yeah right sugar tell me another one.<br>
I digress.  The fact he was wearing the proper head gear saved his noggin, it collapsed and absorbed the impact as designed and all he received was a bad case of road rash and some bruises.  Parents and children alike need to be educated on the benefits of helmet and other protective item usage.  <br>
<br>
Many community police departments sponsor annual 'Bike rodeos' and the like to show the public safe habits and practices for cycling.  It would be of great benefit for parents to involve their children in activities like that as well as searching out other information sources.<br>
<br>
Fining the parent for the child's lack of helmet use is ludicrous.  The law sounds like a sad excuse of some local official to look like he/she cares about the safety of children. All it would seem to do is take cash out of the parents pocket and put it in the local gov't's pocket.  There are far to many other laws the officer could have been out enforcing.  A ticket not only takes time to write, the officer must also fill out an report, file the report and in most places a court date is set taking up time in our already over taxed judicial system.<br>
A huge waste of time? Absolutely, I doubt the 30$ or so would even cover the cost of the wages paid to the officer for the time it takes him to write everything up etc. and I know it wouldn't even begin to cover the time spent on it by the various court employees involved.  Less expensive way to get the kid to wear his/her helmet is to teach them why they need to wear it rather than make a law and waste time enforcing it.  <br>
<br>
Ultimately the parent will end up footing the bill for the child's medical care is they happen to be involved in an accident, so it would seem to make sense for the parent to have their child wear a helmet.  So let the parent do the job of parenting.<br>
<br>
Not even gonna touch motorcyclists and helmets.  I wear one when riding and I also wear leathers to protect the rest of me.  Having had to laydown my bike once or twice I now swear by them both and have to wonder at the sanity of those that don't wear them.<br>
<br>
1)Education and training are the things that prevent <br>
'accidents'.  <br>
<br>
2)Take responsibility for your actions and for the actions of the persons whom your are responsible for.<br>

When I have a mission, it consumes me; I will not be satisfied until the job is done. I have a strong sense of duty, and a strong sense of direction. Changes in the tide don't phase me - I always know which way the wind blows, and I know how to compensate for it. I get on poorly with people like myself. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
