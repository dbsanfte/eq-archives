The first half of the tale!</span><hr size=1> CHAPTER 1: The beggining<br>
<br>
    One morning Sir Brios Cometfyre woke up to a strange voice murmuring &quot;bugs and goo blanket too&quot; over and over again. He got up to find where it was coming from and realized he was lying on the ground in the middle ofthe freeport arena.  When he stood up he felt a sharp pain shoot up the back of his neck.. and he thought to himself, i must have been knocked out again trying to get back to the Hall of truth by that dang guard inofus!!  <br>
    He walked into the jail to get out of the arena and again hurd the voice, &quot;Bugs goo and blanket too&quot; He turned the corner into the jail and saw a ragged old prisoner in the cell! He must be mad, thought Brios. What kind of prisoner would be mumbling about goo and blankets?  <br>
    Something strange must be going on.. I know ive heard that phrase somewhere.. I better go talk to Kalatrina Plossen In the hall of truth, She'll know what this is about.  <br>
    When Sir Brios arrived at the hall of truth he was tired and nervous from just sneaking past all the guards, but he managed to walk up the stairs to the roof to talk to his guildmaster, Lady Kalatrina Plossen.  &quot;Do you know anything about a prisoner in the  West freeport arena that is mad and always mentioning bugs and goo?&quot; said Brios.  &quot;Hmm.. well i dont know but i shall have a spy sent to the freeport militia house right away, maybe if you can get there before him you can find something out, if not give him this note and say .. Truth is good.. and he will open up to you.&quot; &quot;Ok I will.&quot; Replied Brios, I will head out immediatly, Thankyou Milady.  <br>
<br>
<br>
                          CHAPTER 2: Ariska Zimel<br>
<br>
    As Brios walked out the door of his guildhouse and home, The Hall of Truth, he bumped into his Close Friend and guildmate Sir Ijest the druid. &quot;Hail Brother Ijest&quot; said Brios, I am on a quest for Lady Kalatrina, Could you spare a Superior Camoflouge for my trek through West Freeport?&quot; &quot;Of course brother, I am always willing to aid you&quot; Replied Ijest. <br>
   So Sir Brios Cometfyre got his invisibility and headed out.<br>
                                     ***<br>
A few hours later he arrived in the courtyard of the freeport militia building, and carefully looked around before disabiling his invisibilty spell. He approached a strange looking guard who didnt have a name imprinted on his Helm as all the other guards did, so Brios quietly approached him and said &quot;Truth is Good.&quot; <br>
   Startled the &quot;Guard&quot; look Brios in the eye and said &quot;Shhhh!! Quiet down if the guards here you t'will be the death of both of us! Why are you here? kalatrina must have sent you, she is the only one who knew the code. What business have you come for?!!&quot;<br>
   Brios Looked around him carefully then proceeded to pull out a thin peice of parchment with the seal of the Hall of truth on it, He handed it to the still nameless guard/paladin and watched him peel it open.. He gasped and handed Brios another note.. But this time it had the seal of the Temple of Marr on it. Brios Quickly grabbed it, thanked the guard and began to leave.<br>
    As soon as Sir Brios opened the door into the building Brother Jentry.. Sir Lucans D'lere's Brother and bodygaurd, Burst into the  courtyard with a small squadron of gaurds behind him and pointed at the Spy sent by kalatrina and bellowed &quot; KILL him, he is a spy sent bye the damned paladins that have been holding us out of North Freeport for years!!<br>
   The courtyard filled with guard and the spy was quickly slain, but he had managed to kill 7 of the guards, during this process Brios had slipped over the wall of the fort and was already on his was back to kalatrina With the note mysteriously labeled, Ariska Zimel.<br>
<br>
<br>
            CHAPTER 3: Zimels Blades, Ariska Zimel<br>
<br>
     <br>
   Once Brios got back to North Freeport he slowed down to a walk again.. he hated those guards and would do anything to end their reign over the citizens of Freeport!  He was heading towards The Hall of Truth thinking about all of this when he slammed into a little dwarf. The note fell out of Brios's pocketed and the dwarf, seeing the seal, quickly grabbed it and begain to read it.<br>
   The look in the dwarfs eyes as he read the note was that of pure horror and amazement.. his long lost (and thought dead) theiving companion was aliving and living in the West Freeport arena prison!  The dwarf looked up and showed Brios the message, (it looked something like this)  Z..... ......M......... .....L       ....B...L....D....S........ A...R..k..a...!<br>
   Brios looked at the note, then back up at the dwarf, and suddenly burst out laughing. The guard had said it was important, the dwarf was crying and showing such strong emotions at it, then he looks at it and it is nothing but a jumble of random letters and dots!!!<br>
   What is all this??! Said brios. &quot;Are you trying to mock me??&quot;<br>
   &quot;No I am not.. i can not say anything more here.. meet me tonight at the tavern at the docks in East Freeport at 8:00!<br>
  As soon as the dwarf was finished talking he began casting a spell witch caused these strange caustic bubbles to surround him.. Brios reached out to stop him but suddenly the dwarf had completely dissiapeared! and not only that, he had disiapeared to another place.. he was not invisible, he was gone!<br>
   Brios sighed and began to head toward the dock.  By the time he got there it was almost 8 so he bought a few ales for him and the dwarf and sat down and waited...<br>
                                      ***<br>
   About 2 hours later the dwarf walked into the room with a big gash on his forehead and red cloth hanging from his boots, it looked like militia Uniform cloth.  Brios asked him about his condition but the dwarf shook his head and pointed to the note in Brios's Pocket.<br>
   Brios Removed the note and handed the dwarf the note.. The dwarf pulled a quill out of his beard and began scribbling on the note. &quot;Dont ruin it! I need it to finish my quest and to show Kalatrina!&quot; Said Brios.<br>
   &quot;I am not ruining it, Shut up human and let me consentrate.&quot;<br>
After 10 minutes of scratching his beard mumbling and writing on the note he sighed and handed it to Brios.. This is what is looked like.       Z.I.M.E.L.S   B.L.A.D.E.S.     Ariska Zimel......Bugs.. Goo. Blanket too.. FRIEND!<br>
   Brios shook his head looking confused, &quot;Zimels Blades? Ariska Zimel? Bugs and goo blanket too, what does it all mean??  Brios looked up at the dwarf and to his amazement he was gone!  Brios stood up to head back to The Hall of Truth and see if Kalatrina could make sence of it, when he felt some poking around at the back of his armor where his pack was.. he drew his Argent Defender and spun around.. sword at the neck of the theif!  <br>
<br>
            <br>
                 CHAPTER 4: Bugs, Goo and Blanket Too.<br>
<br>
  It was a Poor old begger holding a blanket made of wool and with a little insignia at the bottom that read.. A.Z.                <br>
                                      ***<br>
   Brios Realized suddenly that the note said bugs good and blanket too! That was what that prisoner in the arena was muttering.. His name must be ariska zimel and he must have owned Zimels Blades, if that is so this is why kalatrina told me I was in search of a holy sword!! Hmmm i better get some bugs goo and blanket too. maybe that will get that old prisoner to open up to me.   Brios looked at the Theif and said &quot;Who are you? Where is ariska? Why do you have his blanket?&quot;<br>
   The thief pointed at Brios's ale and nodded. Brios gave him an ale and the prisoner quickly drank it down. &quot;More, more my tongue is still not lose.&quot; Said the theif.<br>
   Brios gave him more and once again the thief said &quot;More more i have returned from a journey and my tongue is still quiet dry&quot;<br>
  Brios repeatead this process 4 times before the thief finally began to talk.<br>
   &quot;I was Ariska's partner, i ran Zimels blades with him and we were also &quot;partners in crime&quot;. We where friends from childhood, until one day that FOOL and I were on a mission to kill Sir Reskin, that drunk guard that hangs out at the inn in EC and sucks up to Sargeant Slate. When we arrived and killed Reskin he grabbed the helmet and the money and the weapons and ran off with it all, not sharing any.. He was cought with it all a few years ago and thrown in jail. Since you helped me with the ail, take this maybe it will help you&quot;  Said the theif, and handed Brios the blanket.<br>
   &quot;Ariska always liked Edible Goo and bug juice to eat while lying under his warm wool blanket, maybe this will help you.&quot; whispered the thief to Brios.<br>
   Brios walked off toward the Hall of Truth, blanket under his arm, note in his pack, thinking about all the strange things that had happened since he had woken up in the arena 2 days ago. <br>
<br>
                                 <br>
                   CHAPTER 5: Jitryd Truestride<br>
<br>
    When Brios arrived at the Hall of Truth he had just about thought everything over 20 times.. and he realized that his quest, Was only beginning. He once again walked up the old stairs to the roof where his Aunt, and Guildleader was, He said &quot;Hello Lady Kalatrina, I have done much since you sent me on my quest.&quot; Brios told her of all that had happened and she looked at him and realized he was telling the truth, he took the note from his hands and said &quot;Yes yes.. I do remember that name... Zimels Blades.. Hmmm, well if you need bugs and good and such i would go and ask Brother Jitryd if he could make you some. <br>
    So off Brios went again to find his friend Jitryd to make him some Bug Juice and Edible Goo.. why wuld anyone wanna eat that stuff? (shrugs) Brios Got to the tunnel in west commons and hailed a wizard named Melekie to port him to Greater Faydark, When brios got there he saw a bunch of young woodelf rangers saying that jitryd had been attacked and taken to Castle Mistmoore by an ugly troll named Xicotl.. Brios, being of his 45th season called his friend Ijest again to come help him rescue jitryd, Ijest came gave himself and Brios Wolf form and headed off to find him.  <br>
   Halfway through lesser Faydark thay came upon a Unicorn that had its fur all dirty and matted and was making crying neheeeey sounds, Ijest gave it a Heal and told it to head to steamfont from more healing on their way back.. It stared at him with a pained look that galloped/limped off into the distance. Finally they reached mistmoore, only having to kill a few Teir'dal and some crazy bandit ladies which proved to be about as strong as orc pawns when attacked by someone with the power of Brios and Ijest. <br>
   Brios and Ijest made the treck through the canyon to mistmoore and when the finally came upon it they were ambushed by a train of flouting gargoyles and some Deformed evil looking wolf named BlackDire. <br>
   Ijest summoned they forces of tunare and suddenly a storm of fiery hail came crashing down uppon the monsters killing all of them but Blackdire, who seemed as of yet unharmed. Brios quickly moved in to engage the Dire Wolf before it could attack ijest, this proved a dangerous task because they wolf could move extremely fast and had razor sharp claws, but Brios Pulled it off. <br>
   He unsheathed DragonSheer, His Argent defender and countered a blow from the wolf, he felt a deadly touch shoot through his body and was ngulfed in a red glow, Ijest Cast superior healing just in time to keep Brios from dying who quickly reposted the next blow doing 180 point of damage and killing the foul wolf, but ijest had gone unconscious from his effort to keep the storm pouring down upon the wolf. <br>
   For the mean time Brios gave ijest the blanket, promising himself to get it back when this was over, and began the climb up the tower into the room of xicotl.  When he reached the top he was crossing the bridge into the main castle a sudden erie blue light came on filling the tunnel with an evil glow. A fiery pain shot through him and a laughing Blue women stepped out behind him, Brios turned around and swunge DragonSheer in a full roundgouse arch and cleaved the Mistmoore gaurd almost in half. <br>
   He prayed to Erolisi to forgive him for so thoughtlessly killing someone who was not truly evil, merely under control of some greater power, and apparently he was forgiven. Brios Charged across the bridge and slammed into the door causing it to crumble and fly inward knocking the 2 vampired unconscious and cripling a huge brown beast weilding a fiery half a sword.  Brios Stabbed downward with all his might and his sword plunged deep into the side of the Shadowknight, but he barely seemed to notice, he heaved upward tosing the door into the air and it came crashing down at the feet of a shackled half elf still in full armor but covered in blood and almost dead, Brios layed his hands upon the Ranger and let his lifeforce flow into him on the higher plane, healing the him and leaving brios tired but high in spirit and ready to fight the evil beast.<br>
   Brios Turned and engaged the troll, who was already to weak to use his harmtouch but was suprisingly skilled and strong, He swung his broken sword down in a crazy thrust knocking Brios back 3 feet and causing him to stumble, xicotl swung again in a powerful backhand thrust. Brios rolled out of the way of the gleaming sword just in time and felt the air hum past and the sword slam into the ground where his head had been moments ago. Xicotl's sword was stuck, he turned around just in time to scream and see Brios's blade crash down upon him, severing him in two and send his body against the wall behind him, splattering gore everywhere. <br>
   Brios Closed his eyes and felt a tear drop down his face at what he had just done, that single tear freed xicotls spirit from Mayong mistmoore and his tortured body, and for a moment the troll like spirit hovered there, touched brios and the shoulder and said, Good luck Brave knight take my hilt from my old sword and bring it to zimel, it will help you in your quest, then the ghost disiapeared as if it had never happened. Brios opened his eyes and bent over, picking up the hilt and the Fine steel sword, and walked over to the ranger who was still fast asleep and murmuring about death to come. Brios lifted his sword and crashed it down onto the shackle showering sparks everywhere and startling the ranger who jolted back and almost got his head in the way of the sword, Brios did this again to the other band and heared the ranger screaming in fear, thinking Brios was here to kill him. <br>
   Brios looked at the Ranger and said &quot;Jitryd, it is ME sir Brios, you will be ok, just go back to sleep and recover a bit for our journey back to freeport. I have killed Xicotl, Brios pointed at the viscera and gore over in the corner with his sword then back at jitryd and smiled.<br>
