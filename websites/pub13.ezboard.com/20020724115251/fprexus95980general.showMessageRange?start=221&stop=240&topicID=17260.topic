<br>
1.  As stated before, McDonalds had on record over 700 burn complaints *including* those with 3rd degree burns.  She's not the first and this was not an isolated incident, and McDonalds was aware of the issue.<br>
<br>
2.  Whereas you can be scalded (mild burns) at 100 degrees, you don't get 3rd degree burns.  There's a huge difference between a <br>
<br>
3.  I said coffee *served* at home is *generally* 130-140.  I didn't say it never gets hotter or that it isn't hotter as it drips down from the pot.  The average person sets the pot on and walks away, coming back to pour it into a cup after it's done.  The *average* temperature of coffee *served* at home is reported at 130-140, not the actual temperature in your pot that you've measured.<br>
<br>
Experts testified that even at 155 degrees, by the time the coffee had soaked through her pants it would not have caused 3rd degree burns.<br>
<br>
4. Can someone please cite me some examples of all the millions of other people who sued McDonalds over this?<br>
<br>
All I was doing here was clarifying the facts on something that was said.  That being:<br>
<br>
1.  The woman didn't win millions of dollars.<br>
<br>
2.  Her complaint wasn't just that 'the coffee was hot' but rather that the coffee was hot to the point that it was unsafe, scarring her for life and putting her in the hospital for 8 days of surgery and debriding (an intensely painful experience)<br>
<br>
3.  I have never heard of there being any sort of a deluge of lawsuits that followed as a result of this woman's successful lawsuit.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but if I were to spill something on myself, of course it's my fault (as the court said it was partially her fault for having spilled it)<br>
<br>
In this case, McDonalds knowingly served a product which had caused severe injuries to others in the past, which they testified they knew could cause injuries and which they testified that they knew was not fit to serve at the temperature they served it.<br>
<br>
They said they thought she'd drink it when she got home.  They never bothered to mention that to her or to any of their customers who came through their store, therefore making them negligent.<br>
<br>

It sounds like McDonald's drinkers need to work on their hand-eye coordination, or stop drinking in their cars.  Even then, blaming a company because you messed up is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
2. &amp; 3. Average coffee is 130-140 degrees...ok, well 140 degrees will give you a 3rd degree burn in 5 seconds.  If you can do it at home...  And what if it wasn't on her pants?  What if she burned her arm directly?  Do you think that would have stopped her from filing a case?  I don't.<br>
<br>
4. Dunno.  Course, that wasn't my point either.  My point was that people file frivilous law suits every day.  I just brought this one up as an example.  The point was that I find the judicial system as a weak point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. She still won.  Principle, not money is what matters here.<br>
<br>
2. Pretty much ALL coffee is &quot;hot to the point that it's unsafe&quot;  Should all coffee machines be recalled?<br>
<br>
3. I never said following.  It's just one of the many that are out there.<br>

Alex... you give a lot of hypothetical arguments.  I simply want to know how, like you said, religion helped you think freely, and how religion in general helps people think freely.<br>
Edit: I don't think religion is so bad.  I think it can help people with some problems they are having, it's just that free-thinking is not one of them. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujensorthetonedeaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jensor the Tonedeaf</A> at: 6/27/02 6:32:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uerrelno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Errelno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 238<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/27/02 6:33:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=224>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> I don't have an issue with the pledge.

<br>
In order for something at 150 degrees to cause 3rd degree burns the key thing is it would have to *remain* 150 degrees for those five seconds.<br>
<br>
As soon as it comes in contact with your clothing or your skin, the temperature of the substance drops.<br>
<br>
I'm no expert in the field, but those who are experts and who did testify at the trial said simply that 150 (or 155...sorry, I don't remember) is not enough to cause 3rd degree burns because it doesn't stay at 150.<br>
<br>
I'm tired and hope I'm making sense &lt;grin&gt;<br>
<br>
If 180 degree liquid hits the skin, it immediately cools on contact *but* it remains at a high enough temperature to cause 3rd degree burns over the few seconds required to generate 3rd degree burns.<br>
<br>
When 150 degree liquid hits the skin, it immediately cools on contact and does *not* remain at a high enough temperature for the time period required to cause 3rd degree burns.<br>
<br>
Again, this is according to the experts who testified &lt;shrug&gt; <p><TABLE align=left>

No... he's not trying to destroy the essense of the pledge.   The essense of this MEANINGLESS pledge was never with any god in mind.  <br>
This is not only for the rights of atheists.  This is for the rights of pagans, and the rights of people who consider this &quot;Church&quot; infringing on &quot;State&quot; (although I think school vouchers is a much better example of this... but that's for another thread). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujensorthetonedeaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jensor the Tonedeaf</A> at: 6/27/02 11:41:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udalmaskmhoruahm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalmask Mhoruahm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 950<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 1:03:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=230>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.keepersofthefaith.org/images/KTF_medium.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> I can't agree with that, Alliara.  A cup of coffee contains enough liquid to keep a sustained heat necessary to scald you.  Hell, through EMT training I was taught that being splashed by a little water over 160 degrees (F) is enough to cause irrepairable damage (third degree burns).  Every degree at that point makes a huge difference on contact time, and I don't imagine you're going to find many coffee makers that keep the temperature below this point, especially commercial machines.  Test one out sometime and see what it reads out as.  I'm kind of sceptical on that average temperature they quoted, I'm honestly interested on what most machines read at.<br>

Kinda like this thread .. the 9th court hold that because &quot;under god&quot; is within the pledge that schools can't force children to say it. The media to sell papers, the radio to sell advertisment, and TV to sell more advertisment for higher ratings are the ones who call it, &quot;The pledge of allegiance is un-constitutional&quot;. <br>
<br>
The McDonalds case may be one of those cases IMHO. I haven't reviewed this case but from the overview of Allairia's discription evidence was presented and the jury decided it was adequate. The system isn't always perfect but it works after a fashion.<br>
<br>
A lot of the class action suits and a lot of the frivolous suits are seemingly out of control, but not all of them. <br>
<br>
I hesitate to legislate against being able to sue for whatever you want... already many legitimate suits are called &quot;frivolous&quot; and in some case's the judges rule what you may or may not introduce in you own defense. If you don't believe kangaroo courts exist in the U.S. your terribly naive.<br>
<br>
It's not an easy problem with easy solutions, the jury is our last line of defense, they are human and sometimes make mistakes. But I would trust a fully informed jury more than I would trust the naked law. <p>Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.

As I said - that was the expert testimony in the case which, to my knowledge, went unrefuted (I did a lot of reading up on it at the time).  However, I'm far from perfect and may be wrong...could be that experts for McDonalds testified just the opposite.<br>
<br>
Overall, my point is that third degree burns, 8 days in the hospital, debridement and skin grafts does *not* equal frivolous lawsuit.  There were actual and serious damage done to this woman.<br>
<br>
You and I could debate the merits of the case till the cows come home, but the point is she did have grounds for a case and actual damages.  To many people who have heard about this case just brush it off as &quot;she spilled coffee and it was hot and got millions of dollars for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The whole point of my post was to point out that there was far more to it than that, just as there's far more to the Pledge of Allegiance issue.<br>
<br>
The number of people who are unaware of the facts behind it - that 'under God' has *not* always been there, that it was prompted by McCarthyism and the paranoid times of Godless Commies - is a bit bothersome.<br>
<br>
In general, what I was trying to say is that there's far more to these stories than most folks know, and that before people go jumping on the bandwagon they should have all the facts.<br>

He's only attempting to destroy the pledge if you believe that the pledge can't be about America without God in it. The only objection is the reference to god, not a reference to america. There are many strong american patriots who just don't want to see religion pushed in the pledge and the writer of the pledge happens to agree with them. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uididartzan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ididar Tzan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 933<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 7:13:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=234>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Alliara,<br>

Not only that, but the author purposefully omitted any reference to any religious symbology knowing it would cause problems. The author, a baptist minister, ALSO never actually referred to the USA or the flag in the original pledge. The section which says &quot;to the flag of the USA&quot; was added after the fact, despite his objection.<br>
<br>
The original pledge, if people want to &quot;honor their history&quot;, was to be a generic pledge to the republic that could be used by ANY nation. The author was a *gasp* liberal, who believed that one day all men all around the world would recite the same pledge. It was only later that the politicians wanted to make the pledge distinctly american and then only the McCarthy paranoia and fear that insisted on putting in a reference to God.<br>
<br>
If Americans want to REALLY honor their history they'd honor the history of a man that felt proud enough of the republic to write that pledge, not a man like McCarthy who would have torn it all apart given the chance. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulordpluto2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordPluto2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 7:43:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=235>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> pledge and other things</span><hr size=1> First of all, about the coffee.

Oh...one more thing...she didn't spill it out of stupidity, the lid wasn't on tight...you can look it up.<br>
<br>
Back to the issue at hand. This country was founded by a bunch of religious nuts that had been kicked out of every civilized country in europe.  To suggest that religion should play no part in the government and that this is stated in the constitution is to show that you've never read the constitution. There are many references to god, the creator, and the almighty throughout the text, as well as in the Declaration of Independence. <br>
<br>
The Bill of Rights itself is not the constitution...many posters here seem ignorant of this fact. This is an adendum to the constitution...and afterthought and if anything shows that the constitution is a living document and subject to change. The seperation of church and state was never meant to be an all encompassing condemnation of all references to religion in government. For the most part, it was meant as a protection for churches by the very same deeply religious men who wrote it. In most of europe, churches are taxed, in some cases heavily. As was mentioned before, there are also several cases of national religions which our forefathers did NOT want to allow in the US, as this is what they were forced to run from in the first place. The only protection for the government from religion that was intended was to prevent the church from having any written powers of government to avoid the problems facing much of europe in it's battles with the pope. Our forefathers knew that the church's agenda would be forwarded through the very democratic process they put in place, ie the religious people would have the opportunity to place religious people into congress who could make their wants known. This was true for the non-religious, although there weren't too many of those openly around at the time.<br>
<br>
To infer that the US is not a country based on, constructed from, and executed by religious ideals is to be utterly ignorant of not only the constitution, but of history. Hell, it's still illegal in 19 states to give or receive a blowjob and until 1974, when it was finally removed from the books, in Chicago, as a male, you could go to jail for 10 years for Fornication if you slept with a woman and didn't marry her. There are thousands of laws just like this.<br>
<br>
In all of this, I think that someone missed the point. They were so busy worrying about their right to not say 2 words that they forgot what the pledge is about. It's about standing up and pledging your allegiance to the very country that gives you the right to bitch about it. If you want to pledge to allegiance under god, do so...or do it under bob marely if that makes you happy...just pledge. Noone has any more right to remove Under God, which I might want to say, then I have to force them to say it. If you got expelled for not saying the pledge, good. You deserved it...you should pack your bags and head out of the country too because you're refusing to give allegiance to your country, regardless of whether or not you do it for god...and that, as far as i'm concerned, is just to the left of being a traitor. Now if you want to stand up and say, &quot; I won't say Under God,&quot; then I got your back...be happy to tell the teacher, the principal and the school board to go to hell if they don't like it, as long as you say the rest of the pledge.<br>

Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 Written by Ted Nugent, the rock singer and<br>
hunter/naturalist, upon hearing that California Senators B. Boxer and D.<br>
Feinstein denounced him for being a &quot;gun owner&quot; and a &quot;Rock Star&quot;.  This was<br>
his response after telling the senators about his past contributions to children's charities and scholarship foundations which have<br>
totaled more than $13.7 million in the last 5 years:<br>
<br>
I'm a Bad American - this pretty much sums it up for me.  I like big trucks,<br>
big boats, big houses, and naturally, pretty women.  I believe the money I<br>
make belongs to me and my family, not some<br>
midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it<br>
away to crack addicts squirting out babies.  I don't care about appearing<br>
compassionate.  I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer.  I<br>
believe ignoring your kids and giving them Prozac might.  I think I'm doing<br>
better than the homeless.  I don't think being a minority makes you noble or<br>
victimized.  I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are<br>
different, weird or make me mad.  This is my life to live, and not<br>
necessarily up to others expectations.  I know what SEX is and there are not<br>
varying degrees of it.  I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.  But if you want to<br>
that's fine; I just don't feel like everyone else should have to.<br>
<br>
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a pack of<br>
cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English.  As of matter of fact, if<br>
you are an American citizen you should speak English.  My uncles and<br>
forefathers shouldn't have had to die in vain so you can leave the countries<br>
you were born in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will.<br>
Get over it.  I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if<br>
you're running from them after they tell you to stop.  If you can't<br>
understand the word 'freeze' or 'stop' in English, see the previous line.  I<br>
don't use the excuse &quot;it's for the children&quot; as a shield for unpopular<br>
opinions or actions.<br>
<br>
I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no<br>
political affiliation do a recount when needed.  I know what the definition<br>
of lying is, and it isn't based on the word &quot;is&quot;-ever.  I don't think just<br>
because you were not born in this country, you qualify for any special loan<br>
programs, gov't sponsored bank loans, etc., so you can open hotel, 7-Eleven,<br>
trinket shop, or any thing else, while the indigenous peoples can't get past<br>
a high school education because they can't afford it.  I didn't take the<br>
initiative in inventing the Internet.  I thought the Taco Bell dog was<br>
funny.  I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.  I believe no one<br>
ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang,<br>
but that doesn't mean I want to listen to that crap from someone else's car<br>
when I'm stopped at a red light.  But I respect<br>
your right to.  I think that being a student doesn't give you any more<br>
enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.  I don't want<br>
to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite or fat-free on the<br>
package.<br>
<br>
Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in vain<br>
and defend our Constitution so that decades later you can tell me it's a<br>
living document ever changing and is open to interpretation.  The guys who<br>
wrote it were light years ahead of anyone today, and they meant what they<br>
said - now leave the document alone, or there's going to be trouble.<br>
<br>
I don't hate the rich.  I help the poor.  I know wrestling is fake.  I've<br>
never owned, or was a slave, and a large percentage of our forefathers<br>
weren't wealthy enough to own one either. Please stop blaming me because<br>
some prior white people were idiots - and remember, tons of<br>
white, Indian, Chinese, and other races have been enslaved too - it was<br>
wrong for every one of them.  I believe a self-righteous liberal Democrat<br>
with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.  I want<br>
to know exactly which church is it where the &quot;Reverend&quot; Jessie<br>
Jackson preaches; and, what exactly is his job function.  I own a gun, you<br>
can own a gun, and any red blooded American should be allowed to own a gun,<br>
but if you use it in a crime, then you will serve the time.<br>
<br>
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue<br>
to make more.  If it makes you mad, then invent the next operating system<br>
that's better and put your name on the building.  Ask your buddy that<br>
invented the Internet to help you.  <br>
 <br>
I don't believe in hate crime legislation.  Even suggesting it makes me mad.  You're telling me that<br>
someone who is a minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise<br>
different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human<br>
being that I do as a white male.  If someone kills anyone, I'd say that it's<br>
a hate crime. We don't need more laws!  Let's enforce the ones we already<br>
have.  I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.<br>
<br>
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child - it takes a<br>
parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say &quot;NO!&quot;<br>
when it's necessary to do so.  I'll admit that the only movie that ever made<br>
me cry was Ole Yeller.  I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a<br>
kid.  I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep<br>
silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.  I thought this country<br>
allowed me that right.  I will not conform or compromise just to keep from<br>
hurting somebody's feelings.  I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no<br>
matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to<br>
believe otherwise. Yes, I guess by some people's definition, I may be a bad<br>
American.  But that's tough.<br>
<br>
Ted Nugent<br>
<br>
<br>
Seemed to go along with the subject matter. Ted may be a bit nuts, but I'd have to say I agree with him on the majority of this.<br>

The constitution is inclusive of the amendments, *especially* the Bill of Rights! Also a &quot;living document&quot; has connotations of delusional arbitrary interpretation. Tis something to think about, the constitution is a rule book telling the government what it can and cannot do.

Force is the issue here .... forget the &quot;under God&quot; part. Forcing anyone to pledge against their will is Un-American and reduce's the pledge to little more than drivel.
