Or just an item you get in exchange for helping him?  You have to sacfirice your Fiery Avenger in the quest, which is understandable, but is the sword just something this guy is carrying around on him... only to give to you when you're done?  or is it THE sword he speaks of in the text above?<br>

The fiery defender is not the sword that he carried around. He carried around the gleaming crested sword, which is the purified sword you recieve from cleansing the sword from the hole. (Well I think that is the correct name.. been awhile since I did it)<br>
<br>
The Fiery Defender is a &quot;gift&quot; from the Gods to Irak to test him of his sacrifice for being gone so long from the temple halls. Once he sacrifices the Fiery Defender to another worthy paladin (aka the paladin that turns in the mark and the FA) he is welcomed into the afterlife with open arms. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualluveal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alluveal</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://216.40.201.38/contrib/scorchio/saevilw.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 260<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/02 1:54:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11929.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.alluveal.com/firelady4arm.gif width=60 height=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladin / Warrior / Rogue Epic Walk-Through</span><hr size=1> Ah HAH!!

Would it be easy to say then, that the paladin sword (Fiery Defender) was created BY the gods?  (same as Innoruuk's Curse?)  And given to a worthy recipient?<br>

<br>
Stanos ( 2nd in command of the circle, also rogue GM of highpass ) did not want this to happen, so he backstabbed Johann and the teir dal agent ( a liason of the general that was in the circle ).<br>
<br>
Before the assassination the circle made a dagger to assassinate the high elf:<br>
<br>
&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'To allow the assassin to slay a prince, and fight his way back out, a fell blade was crafted. It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor. Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears. I would glady rid myself of it, but I fear I can not until I clear my name with Hanns. <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
To clear Stanos name with hanns, the epic questing rogue pickpockets notes from Founy Jestards and Tani Nmar(rogue GMs) in neriak and kaladim about the assassination. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'I need proof that what I say about Johann is truth, so that Hanns may forgive me. YOU can gather that proof for me. First, travel to Kaladim and Neriak, and there, upon the persons of the rogue guildmasters, you should find that which I seek, two parts of a document I recovered from the dead agent. I entrusted one to Founy, but that trust is gone, and Founy would betray me to Hanns were I to attempt to reclaim it. Tani N'mar has the other, which he should not possess, and keeps it only to spite me, not knowing its real import. Steal them both, and bring them back to me. And don't let anyone follow you! If I am not around, tell Anson you want to see me. &quot;<br>
<br>
Once the fledgling assassin gets the two notes for him, stanos finds out he cannot read it, it must be translated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'Excellent! With this document I can..' &lt;He pauses for a moment&gt;. 'Damnation! Curse my tired old mind, I forgot that I could not read the document. It is written in some obscure code or language. I can't decipher it, but I know someone who can. Seek out one called Eldreth, an Erudite who used to do work for me. I know not where he may be found these days, only that he will not be found in Erudin, as they want his head for some misdeed in the past. Give him the complete parchment, and tell him I sent you. He owes me. &quot;<br>
<br>
Eldreth charges you 100pp and two bags of milk to translate it.<br>
<br>
But it turns out he cannot fully translate it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eldreth says 'Hmm, interesting. This document is not only encoded, but written in a very obscure language. From what I can gather, it's a variant of elder Teir'dal, but not one I've encountered. I can not fully translate this, but I know one who can. Find Yendar and give him this <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
The rogue goes to yendar starphyre, a gnomish researcher in steamfont.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yendar Starpyre says 'Oh, if it is written in Elder Teir'Dal, most likely I can translate it. I will be happy to try, in any case. Let me see it, please. <br>
<br>
Yendar Starpyre says 'I say, this is indeed a challenge. This is written in what I'm sure is the language of the High Priesthood of Innoruuk. I've often wished I could read this, but I have never had the key to unlock the language. Take this for now. &quot;<br>
<br>
To translate the note Yendar needs a lexicon from the plane of hate called the &quot;book of souls&quot;.  The rogue sneaks behind the maestro of rancor and picks it up off the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yendar Starpyre says 'The Book of Souls chronicles all the lives Innoruuk has tainted over the years. It is in the care of the Maestro of Rancor. I can use this tome as a basis for my translation, if you return it and the note to me. An experienced practitioner in the art of non-detection should be able to snatch it from its resting place, don't you think, Segfault?<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
When yendar finally translates the letter with the book, stano's evil daughter, renux herkanor spawns and takes the letter, the rogue brings a small raid to kill her.<br>
<br>
Yendar Starpyre says 'My, this is quite a large list! Yes, I can use the names and dates recorded here to help me understand the script. It should be a simple matter now. A moment, please. Aha, yes, there we go. Traslated as best I can! I do hope you're not involved in what is described here, as it is quite fiendish. Oi! You, woman! Give that back! Soandso , that woman there took your letter! I think I should leave you to discuss it with her. Best of luck! <br>
<br>
Renux drops a translated parchement, which can be read by the rogue, the text is:<br>
<br>
&quot;T'kar:<br>
<br>
We are ready for you to move into the next phase of the plan.<br>
<br>
I have read your thoughts on the x'kanta Johann, and his chosen tool, Stanos. Johann is a willing pawn, and will serve us well, for greed is yet another facet of Innoruuk's power.<br>
<br>
Stanos should also work out well, he is quite formidable, though I understand he does not yet know he has been chosen to actually carry out the task. Watch him well when the time comes, but I agree with your judgment.<br>
<br>
Joren will be in Qeynos the entire month, so you have ample time to s'ktkar your task. Enclosed are the tools you will give to the Human x'kanta.<br>
<br>
The blade is a gift from Innoruuk himself, forged in his temple and imbued with rage. Be sure to recover it after the mission is complete, it is much too powerful to leave in the hands of those we intend to il'kaash in the future. Combined with Stanos' skill, Joren and his guards should fall easily.<br>
<br>
The Guise has been handcrafted by our Master Coercer and should allow the wearer to pass undetected as Koada'dal, thus allowing the assassin to gain entry into the Ambassador's quarters. Luckily, it shall be a human transforming himself into that zm'rina form.<br>
<br>
Be sure to eliminate all the human x'kanda you have recruited, and have no fear of the repercussions, for the Circle of Unseen Hands is no threat to us here in Neriak.<br>
<br>
I have spoken with your master Tani N'mar and he assures me that his group of x'kantar will aid us if need be.<br>
<br>
<br>
GENERAL RALD VGHERA &quot;<br>
<br>
NOTE that the general speaks of the high elf illusion mask.<br>
<br>
Renux also drops a dagger which you will turn into stanos with your final stuff to get your epic.<br>
<br>
She also drops some rogue armor, and a sword.<br>
<br>
Giving stanos the parchment:<br>
<br>
'Stanos Herkanor says 'Let me see what you have here. Aha, so that's who.. yes, yes! There is one more thing I need you to do. This document tells me who the originator of the plot really was. His name is General V'ghera, which is interesting, as Anson's men have spotted him in Kithicor recently. He will not be easy to get to, but if you give this box to one of his many aides, the General will HAVE to come to investigate. You see, this box used to contain the tools crafted for the assassination. When he arrives, kill him! I need any documents you find on him - with luck it will be enough evidence to convince Hanns that what I say is true. Bring any documents or dispatch cases you find, along with those blades Vilnius made you work so hard for, and we will make a trade. <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
So you spawn general by giving his box to the DE's loot his pouch, and give it to stanos with the jagged diamond dagger, and the cazic quill ( side quest from vilinus the small, or can rarely drop off general ).<br>
<br>
Give the jagged diamond dagger, cazic quill, and generals pouch to stanos:<br>
<br>
&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'Very well done. I leave now to confront Hanns with this evidence. Even so, it will not be easy to regain his trust. That is why I need those daggers, in case all else fails.&lt;chuckle&gt; Bristlebane grant me luck - I can no longer live like a hunted dog. In any case, I am grateful for your aid. Take this wretched blade, I can bear it no longer. I must warn you, I feel it carries Innoruuk's curse; all who are near it learn the meaning of hate. &lt;chuckle&gt; Ironic, isn't it? You went to all that work to redeem yourself for a rapier, yet the true reward came when you redeemed another. &lt;chuckle&gt;. Good luck, Soandso , for much as I, you will need it.&quot;<br>

<br>
[Mon Apr 01 22:55:55 2002] Irak Altil screams so loudly it echoes across the valley as the mark and flames of your holy sword touch his rotted bones.  As his body twists he quiets and then speaks.  'Your selflessness has made it possible to redeem my honor.  With the cleansing of my corruption your own soul has been strengthened.  Your power comes from your devotion to your god and with this you have been rewarded.  Remember always your purity, devotion, and why you have sacrificed.  I must go now to sacrifice myself upon the spear of pain.'<br>
<br>
A nice April Fool's reward, don't ya think?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you're looking for quest backstories, may I also recommend the Divine Might quest.  Divine Might is the 49th level Paladin quest spell.  This quest also features an undead defiled paladin who must be laid to rest.  His bones and gear have been scattered across Norrath - you must find all his bones, his sword, and his shield.  When you combine them in a specially constructed coffin, his revenant spawns.  The spell is a reward from the Hall of Truth.<br>

<br>
From what I understand, Inny was the only one that could at the time curse his equipment. Don't remember why, but I found it somewhere. Will have to look around again for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=11929.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=11929.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11929.topic&index=20><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.threadControl?topicID=11929.topic><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/del1.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11929.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11929.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm70">News and Events<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">The Outer Realm (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">The Hall of Honor<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">The Fellowship of Guilds<option value="brellserilisfrm53">The Valley of Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">The Back Alley (Link to Rants)<option value="brellserilisfrm71">Raids: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (BUYING)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Selling and Trading)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion>The Commons (General EQ Discussion)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
