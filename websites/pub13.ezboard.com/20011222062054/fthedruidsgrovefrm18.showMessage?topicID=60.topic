<br>
There are actually 8 quests involved in this quest, and I will do my very best to explain each one as thouroughly as I can.<br>
<br>
#1 - Bring 4 Kromrif Picks to Shamus<br>
#2 - Crest of the Drixie<br>
#3 - Crest of the Wood Nymph<br>
#4 - Crest of the Fauns<br>
#5 - Crest of the Sifaye<br>
#6 - Crest of the Fairy Dragons<br>
#7 - Crest of the Unicorn<br>
#8 - Tunarean Signet Ring<br>
<br>
Please be advised that I did the mobs and quest at level 57, so my opinion is biased towards that.<br>
<br>
#1 - Bring 4 Kromrif Picks to Shamus<br>
<br>
Where? <br>
Wakening Land only - Shamus is on the bottom level of the Plane of Growth tower, with a wood nymph sitting on either side of him.<br>
<br>
How? <br>
Hailing Shamus will get him to ask for a friend of the court.  Tell him you are a friend and he will ask for 4 Kromrif Laborer Picks.<br>
<br>
How to complete quest?<br>
On the east wall in the Wakenling Land is the entrance to Kael Drakkel, single pull and root/dot kromrif laborers for their picks.  They drop reasonably common.  LOOK FOR THE OTHER RARES!<br>
Be advised that EACH pick is GIANT sized, and does not fit in a backpack (as well as being heavy as heck, I was very encumbered with 4.)  Have an open inventory slot for EACH of these.<br>
<br>
Take the 4 picks back to Shamus and he will give you a six slot container. - Complete<br>
<br>
#2 – Crest of the Drixie<br>
Where?<br>
Wakening Land - Lord Prismwing I spotted to the north of the plane of Growth Tower.<br>
Cobalt Scar - Yvolocarn can spawn in ANY wyvern location, fortunately on most servers they are pretty much constantly cleaned out for xp.<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Hailing Lord Prismwing will make him ask you if you are a friend of the court.  Answering him he will ask you to find out about a missing Drixe that went to Cobalt Scar.<br>
<br>
How to complete the Quest?<br>
Head to Cobalt Scar, and kill Wyvern placeholders.  Any druid over level 50 can do this easily by either quadding or root/dotting.  Wyverns are generally perched high up on the upper ledge, you can't miss them.<br>
Eventually Yvolcarn will spawn.  He is a level 52 summoning Wyvern with a -CoV faction hit for killing.  You can NOT solo Yvolcarn, but a decent 55+ melee partner you can make pretty short work of him.  I would advise a full group though.<br>
Loot the Drixie Remains and hand them in to Lord Prismwing for the Crest of the Drixie - Complete<br>
<br>
#3 Crest of the Wood Nymph<br>
<br>
Where?<br>
Wakening Land - Eysa Florawhisper is located just west of the entrance to Kael, you can pick her up on tracking from the WL/Kael Drakkel zone line.<br>
Greater Faydark<br>
Field of Bone<br>
Misty Thicket<br>
Toxxulia Forest<br>
Ocean of Tears<br>
Lake Rathetear<br>
Trakanon's Teeth<br>
Butcherblock Mountains<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Hailing Eysa Florawhisper she will ask you if you are a friend of the court.  Answering her she will give you an 8 slot container (please note, HAVE AN OPEN INVENTORY SLOT) and ask you to collect 8 foraged items from around Norrath.<br>
<br>
How to complete the Quest?<br>
You need to Forage 8 items to complete this quest, although it was MUCH easier to do than the epic in my opinion.<br>
Here are the locations and the items needed.<br>
Greater Faydark - Ripened Heartfruit (That's right the epic peice) - NO DROP<br>
Field of Bone - Flarefire Seeds - NO DROP<br>
Misty Thicket - Misty Acorn - Rumour has it you can pick it up off the ground, I foraged mine.<br>
Toxxulia Forest - Bag of Caynar Nuts<br>
Ocean of Tears - Marr Cherries<br>
Lake Rathetear - Rathe Berries<br>
Trakanon's Teeth - Emerald Orange<br>
Butcherblock Mountains - Vineclinger Berris - NO DROP<br>
<br>
There are no &quot;better&quot; places to forage any of these items... just buckle it up and keep clicking.<br>
Combine all 8 items in the box and hand in to Eysa for the Crest of the Drixie - Complete<br>
<br>
#4 - Crest of the Fauns<br>
<br>
Where?<br>
Wakening Land - Shamus again, bottom floor of th PoG tower<br>
Kael Drakkel<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Hail Shamus and he will inform you about a kromzek architect that has plans for the expansion of Kael.<br>
<br>
How to complete Quest?<br>
Locate the storm giant architect in Wakening Land, his placeholders are regular kromrif laborers.  You can solo him but he is a necromancer.  Root/Dot him and it's game over for that mob.  Loot the plans and return to shamus - BEWARE HAVE AN OPEN INVENTORY SLOT AVAILABLE.  Shamus will give you a container for 4 crystallized sulphur and a bag of crushed herbs.<br>
Locate 4 crystallized sulphur, I bought 4 from the Othmir vendors in CS, but they drop off the kromrif laborors and Wyverns in Cobalt Scar.  Combine them in the container and head to Kael Drakkel.<br>
Keep both bags at easy access in your inventory, and max your FR and make sure you have SoW up.<br>
Zone into Kael from the WL side, head up the first ramp and there will be four partially completed buildings.  The one you are looking for is the one most southeast.  There are 2 bags on the floor, start clicking on that floor until a trade window pops up.  BEWARE!!! once a window pops up you become VISIBLE and are KOS ... move fast or risk death.  Put the bag of combined sulpher and the bag of herbs in the window and click trade.<br>
YOU WILL TAKE FIRE DAMAGE - I took 42 points with a FR of 169.<br>
A third bag appears on the ground.  Pick it up and boogie for the zone out.<br>
In your inventory you will have a &quot;pile of rubble&quot; hand this to Shamus and receive the Crest of the Fauns - Complete.<br>
<br>
<br>
#5 – Crest of the Sifaye<br>
<br>
Where?<br>
Wakening Land – Countess Silveana is trackable from just east of where Rolandal sits.  And apparently has a placeholder that gives a negative tunare hit… I would advise instead of killing PH just wait till she shows up.<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Hailing Countess Silveana she will introduce herself, ask her “what tunarean court” to get a response.<br>
Ask her “what giants” and she will inform you of a giant with a “metal stick.”<br>
<br>
How to complete the Quest?<br>
Go back to killing kromrif laborers outside of Kael.  A rare will spawn named storm giant surveyor.  Kill him and loot the surveyor’s scope.  Turn this into Countess Silveana and receive the Crest of the Sifaye. – Complete<br>
<br>
#6 Crest of the Fairy Dragons<br>
Where?<br>
Wakening Land – Lord Gossemerwind – He’s about as rare as rare can be, the one time I saw him he was west of the PoG tower.  I caught him immediately after the server repop.<br>
<br>
How?<br>
Hail Lord Gossemerwind and tell him “I wish to assist.”  Lord Gossemerwind will tell you about the kromzek foreman.<br>
<br>
How to complete Quest?<br>
Back to killing kromrif laborers.  Sooner or later komzek foreman will spawn.  He is soloable… but snare and root are very difficult to stick.  Bring along a fear kiting partner and it’s game over for this guy.  Loot a Kromzek Foreman Helm and hand it in to Lord Gossemerwind and receive the Crest of the Fairy Dragon. – Complete<br>
<br>
<br>
#7 Crest of the Unicorn<br>
Where?<br>
Plane of Mischief<br>
<br>
How?<br>
There is a long and complex predate to this quest that does NOT require to be done… if you wanna do it go to this link. - <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1108">everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=1108</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
How to complete this Quest – <br>
Go to Plane of Mischief and find Lithiniath.  I recommend at least on VERY sold group 58+.<br>
Lithiniath is a level 63 black unicorn, kill her and loot the horn.  Hand the horn into the white stallion in that room and receive the Crest of the Unicorn – Complete.<br>
<br>
How do I get to PoM?<br>
It’s a crazy difficult thing to do… www.planeofmischief.com and read up on it.<br>
No, you can’t do it alone, and yes you probably need to be friends with an Uber guild to get there.<br>
<br>
Put all crests in the box and combine.<br>
<br>
#8 Hand the combined box of crests into Shamus.  And receive your reward.<br>
