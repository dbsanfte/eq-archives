<br>
~<br>
<br>
'Bard, Ye have been summoned to the Court of Estrella, to learn the true fate of Kedge Keep.  Thou shall not be attacked by the Keep's inhabitants, as long as the Master lies dead.  He wishes no mortals to know of his sins, nay Our Sins against the Gods.<br>
<br>
'Lady,' spoke the bardess softly.  'There are many songs of the fate of this Keep, but all are known to be works of fiction.  Why have you chosen now, after all these years?  And why, although I am flattered, why me?'<br>
<br>
'Shoshannah, I believe the mortals call thee.  We have seen thy sorrow when one of us dies.  We have heard thy softly spoken prayer to Tunare for our souls.  We see, in thee a compassion that we have not seen in many eons.  A sorrow we have not felt in all of our time on Norrath.  That is the reason we have chosen ye to tell our tale.  As for the time, we have had many decades to contemplate our fate, and we feel that only through the truth of our tale, will our souls be redeemed.  But come, hear our tale, and perhaps all of thy questions will be answered, and some of the mysteries solved.'<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Kedge Keep was always a busy place with foreign dignitaries, merchants, and musicians.  All were welcome in the Keep.  We held conferences between warring races, we were known as the mediators of the world.  The respect the inhabitants of the Keep were awarded was amazing.  Although the elves were known to be the Oldest Children of Tunare, we were known as the First Children.  For we were the First Children of our Lord Prexus, and the only ones that were sentient beings.<br>
<br>
The surrounding houses of nobility also played a part in Kedgerean history.  While the Keep was a gathering place, no mortals were allowed to see the sun set here.  Prexus had declared it law, and we, as his First Children honored him.<br>
<br>
The nobles were guests of the Lord and Lady of Unrest.  Now 'tis haunted and decaying, but then, then 'twas filled with beauty and spirituality.  I know not the story of Unrest, for its fall was after ours, and by then we ceased to care about the mortal world.<br>
<br>
The more common visitors, the musicians and gypsies stayed at the Castle of Mistmoore.  Lord Mistmoore loved to surround himself with beauty, and what could be more beautiful than the gypsy dancers and the minstrels playing their lutes?  This was also before his fall into depravity, before sin came to his soul.<br>
<br>
As the sun would set over the peaks of the Cauldron, yes my dear, you had thought it had another name so long ago?  Nay, 'twas named the Cauldron for the look of the sun set upon the waters.  <br>
<br>
The dying sun would set the waters ablaze, truly was said to be one of the more beautiful sights in all Norrath.  At night, aaahh the nights.  The waters surrounding Kedge would rise, the sun would set over the peaks surrounding us.  The moon, Luclin, would rise and cast her shadows upon our waters.  It was truly a lovely site to behold, but far more lovely was seeing my sisters frolicking in the waters.<br>
<br>
The sun setting, the tides, and the moon were all keys to our release.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Shoshannah looked at the Golden Haired Mermaid curiously.  Opening her mouth to ask a question, she was halted.<br>
<br>
The beautiful mermaid held up a delicate hand to stop the flow of words.<br>
<br>
'What release, ye were about to ask.'<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
Our release back to our natural forms, your kind called us mermaids.  You see, Prexus in all his wisdom,' Shoshannah detected a bit of sarcasm here.  'Prexus, had granted his first children special powers.  By day, when the tides receded from the walls of Kedge Keep, we were able to take on the form of the mortals who surrounded us.  Most chose the delicate forms of the elves, so similar to our features.  But, a few others and I chose that form you wear.  The face of Humans.<br>
<br>
We loved the feel of the youth of your race rushing through our cold veins.  We felt emotions we had never before felt, and truly, they were addictive.  Our Human bodies cried out with needs we did not understand or recognize until it was too late.<br>
<br>
It had always been decreed that the visitors of Kedge Keep must depart when the sun first started to sink below the peaks.  For Prexus jealously guarded his first children, and knew that we were at our most vulnerable during our changing from land-walkers to sea-dwellers.<br>
<br>
Those of us that had chosen the Human form, so different from our own, began to resent this law of the God's.  Why?  Why did our friends have to leave us?  We were like children; we felt we were being punished for some unknown wrongdoing, never understanding that Prexus decreed this for our own safety.<br>
<br>
We loved the sounds of the sea music; it's haunting melodies so familiar, yet always changing.  But we still longed to join the party, for when there were gypsies, there was always a party and gaiety.  We longed to dance to the bardic rhythms, to love like the gypsies, to experience the freedom they enjoyed.<br>
<br>
One of my sisters desired it more than we knew.  She had fallen in love, or what she thought was love, with one of the young bards that graced our halls.  Being too long in the Human form, she began to also feel the harsher feelings.  Jealousy of other women he might want, real and imagined, fueled her seeds of hatred.<br>
<br>
She began to whisper her thoughts to the others.  She placed seeds of turmoil, lust, and greed into us.<br>
<br>
She came to me, whispering words that brought envy to my heart.  Envy for one human's beauty.  These golden locks you see are not mine.  Prexus granted me my desire you see, he is the one that gave me my golden hair.<br>
<br>
To the others she whispered different words, all designed to make us blind to her plans.  She thought by distracting us, her crimes would go unnoticed.  Our crimes would out-weigh hers in the eyes of our God.<br>
<br>
Lord Undertow, usually so full of energy and ideas, became lax and lazy.  My Lords Cauldronbubble and Cauldronboil had always enjoyed a meal, but now eating was all they did.  Indulging every whim for anything they wished to eat or drink, they were gluttonous and disgusting.<br>
<br>
The Ladies of the Court, those that surrounded Estrella, Coralyn, and Shellara became greedy, hoarding the many treasures of the deep.  Concerned only for what more they may obtain.<br>
<br>
Lady Estrella, for the first time in her long life, showed anger.  Everything was met with a temper.  Objects were thrown, screams of fury echoed within the halls.<br>
<br>
Our visitors began to leave; the idyllic haven that had been Kedge Keep was becoming another hell, for the visitors and those of us who dwelled within.<br>
<br>
Shellara Ebbhunter had always been beautiful, but now she rarely moved from in front of her looking glass, day and night she gazed with rapturous glee upon her beauty.  She admired the shine of her scales at night, the turn of her legs during the day.  Her hands were the objects of many hours of contemplation, and she told any who came near about her beauty.<br>
<br>
The Knight of Prexus, Lord Phinigel Autropos, whose care Prexus had entrusted the Keep to, was overcome with one of the greatest sins against the gods.  Each hour I heard a new tale of his crimes, each one growing worse.  Yet, we turned our backs upon the tales.  So we are guilty of that also.<br>
<br>
What tales you ask?  Coralyn thought every man was controlled by his baser desires.  So to our lord, she whispered words to inflame his lust, to make his desire uncontrollable.<br>
<br>
His desires were so powerful; he believed it within his right to take what he wished.  Even if the maiden cried nay!  Many young maid were lost in those few hours, they were unable to survive the brutality of the lord, or they did not want to.  Many maids were found bleeding to death, the sight of which the sea-folk had never witnessed.  Pain was unknown to us, death only came when we wished it, and it came very peacefully.<br>
<br>
Coralyn, however, would be the one to open the baleful eye of Prexus.  Her bard, the one that caused her to sow the seeds of discord, had told Coralyn of a drum.  A drum that only a First Child could create, a drum that would imbue the bard using it with greater powers.  Coralyn thought that if she created this drum for her bard he would take her away with him.  She had delusions that he would take her from her life under the sea; free her from the Eye of Prexus.<br>
<br>
To make this new drum, she needed to stretch the skin of a shark over the cavity of its skull.  She had to kill one of Prexus's children.<br>
<br>
Her shell knife quickly did the deed; swiftly she created the drum and presented it to the bard.  Gratefully he took it from her, feeling the power within it.  And taking the hand of his gypsy lover he waved good-bye to Coralyn.<br>
<br>
She cried out to Prexus about the injustice done to her, and woe to us, he answered.<br>
<br>
'My child, ye cry to me of injustice?  'Twas thee that brought sin and horror to my First Children.  Thy seeds of discord and hatred brought my children to the level of mortals.'<br>
<br>
'No my Lord!' She cried.  'Twas not me! 'Twas the bard with his honeyed words, his lies!' gasped Coralyn.<br>
<br>
'Even now!  Even now, when I can see the blackness of thy soul, ye seek to bring hatred!  Wilt thou never learn Coralyn?  'Tis a lesson I'm thinking ye need to be taught.  All of ye!' His voice boomed.  'All of my beloved First Children.'<br>
<br>
With that the sea rose and the very earth shook.  The screams echoed through the lands, the creatures of the seas were driven mad with the screams traveling through the waters.  Thousands died, their blood staining the fallen pillars and the beautiful mosaics of the Keep.<br>
<br>
As the many died, Prexus sheltered us, the ones who had caused this destruction.  We could feel his hand forming a mighty barrier between death and us.  He had a punishment in mind for us, a punishment to fit our crimes.  We witnessed the destruction of our home.  We witnessed the deaths our many friends, lovers, and family.  But, our cries of sorrow would not melt the coldness that incased Prexus's heart.  The destruction continued for days, not only to the Keep, but the Cauldron.  Our mountains became stony fingers of pain, forcing their way towards the sky, bringing horror and death to those Kedgereans that tried to escape to the Estate of Unrest. <br>
<br>
When the destruction was finished he turned to us, the Punished we began to call ourselves.  We truly at that time did not know or understand what true Punishment was, and now, only now are we beginning to understand.<br>
<br>
To me, he gave what I had envied most, the Golden Locks of a Human.  He then told me I would be hunted for my hair.  Many Rangers would come seeking to complete a quest for one of the most powerful bows in all of Norrath.  Such was the price I paid for my envy.<br>
<br>
Lord Undertow was turned into a Seahorse, Lords Cauldronboil and Cauldronbubble he turned into sharks.<br>
<br>
The Ladies were allowed to maintain their mermaid form, as were all the Ladies of the Court.  But they were forced to give up their riches upon their deaths.<br>
<br>
Lady Estrella and Lady Shellara are also hunted for items they hold.  Items that give the holder greater powers towards their callings.<br>
<br>
Lord Phinigel, Prexus knew he was still loyal to him, yet his crimes could not go unpunished.  Therefore Prexus confined Phinigel to a single hall, and placed a bone on the bottom of the floor of the hall.  The bone was to be used for a quest for Paladins.  Phinigel's brothers -in-faith would now kill him, to complete their holy quest.<br>
<br>
What of Coralyn you ask?<br>
<br>
To her, Lord Prexus returned the drum.  And by doing so, every bard throughout the land would come to kill her, and receive the drum, with the blessings of Prexus.  The very beings Coralyn wished to join would now be her doom.<br>
<br>
We all thought our punishment would end at our first death.  But no, we are killed and Prexus holds us in his hand, he studies our souls, he is looking for remorse.  He never has found it, each time we die we are sent back.  To relive our hell again. <br>
