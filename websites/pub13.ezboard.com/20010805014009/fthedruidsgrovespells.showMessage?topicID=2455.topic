Before they upped the drop rate on RFS, I saw it go for anywhere from 5k to 30k on Innoruuk.  I still haven't seen it being sold a lot (I got one off a ry`gorr elite at the orc fort shortly after the last patch), so I'd guess the price has come down some, but it's still prolly worth at least 1-2k.<br>
<br>
As a side note, the aggro from RFS seems to be proportional to the level of the mob.  I was casting Ensnare and RFS on mobs while grouped with a52 monk, and the green/lower mobs would turn to aggro on him MUCH sooner than the blue/higher mobs.  A friend went on a Hate raid and said that if he snared and RFS'd a mob there, it would take more than 30 seconds of a full hate raid group to get the mob off him.<br>

Like someone said before &quot;Its a lvl 59 spell disguised as a lvl 39&quot;.  As for aggro control<br>
1. let the rangers snare<br>
2. distance<br>
3. timing<br>
<br>
I use this spell quite effectively in ToV.  I tend to cast it at the begining of a fight, typically after tash and/or malo and then I wait a bit, I am usually as far away from the mob as I can be.  Then  Breath of Ro followed by Wildfires, as long as I dont chaincast I wont get summoned.  I have been playing around with the timing to see how fast I can cast Wildfire without getting summoned.  Its nice seeing Wildfire hit for full time after time.<br>
<br>
Price on spell pre-patch 5k - 15k.  After patch its still going for around 1 - 2k.  I expect the price to level around 500-1k maybe even lower once every Druid has one, it is dropping quite frequently now. <br>

The suggestion to have a ranger or perhaps another druid snare is a good one, as the snare + Ro's Fiery almost guarantees you top billing on the mobs &quot;Must Kill&quot; list.  If I time it out, I can put up Ro's Fiery, wait a few seconds, then toss Breath of Ro, wait a few seconds, then drop a starfire or two (only 52nd so far) and still avoid most summons.  However, I have cast Ro's Fiery on mobs with 50% damage already and got pulled and smacked around, so there is always some risk involved when you have summoning creatures.  And be prepared to die if your main tank (that has been taunting it off of you) should suddenly get killed, because that mob is coming straight for the debuffing druid more than likely.  I had that happen in Kael and it was NOT a pretty sight.<br>
<br>
Pricing on Rallos:  It's been dropping like flies everywhere.  I've seen several for sale for 500pp, one even for 100, but he said he wasn't worried about gouging anyone.  With the additional debuffing on PvP now though, they may be even MORE in demand than before. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uszaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Szaero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/3/01 10:17:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ro's Fiery Sundering</span><hr size=1> Bought mine finally for 100p the other day.

I was just trying to get a key. So my trip was cut short. As for aggro it does aggro some but not nearly as much as healing, Snare, Fixation of Ro, or other spells of that nature. I did get hit a couple of times while using it but i would get hit a lot more often casting snare first on similar MOBs. Waiting a little to let the melee classes to get some aggro worked well and I never got hit just casting this if I waited for it to lose 10% or so health first. <br>
<br>
 On aggro I found the best way to die against a high HP summoning creature is to snare, then heal the cleric it is currently beating on because of over aggroing healing. I would always prefer for a Ranger to snare duing a big encounter because snaring then chain healing to keep someone alive will almost always get me summoned and then usually killed. It seems if I am just aggro from the heals and not from snaring usually they can taunt it off before I die. <br>

I personally haven't seen one drop from the MoWs despite hours of killing there, but the guy I bought my copy from said that's where he got it.  (20pp - couldn't resist that price!) <br>
<br>
I've seen a really good drop rate on the spell in Tower of Frozen Shadow, though.  We did a raid there the weekend after I bought my spell with our sister guild and had 6 copies of the spell drop in 4 hours.  (Two copies of Turning of the Unnatural, as well.) We were holding the fifth floor wedding party and the golem ushers from the entrance.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!  It's a really great spell.<br>

Also, MoW's are not mixxed in with the Warriors and Hunters near the Prison, for them you must go to the south shore of the zone where the Walrus live, clear Walrus until a MoW appears as Walrus are PH for MoW. However the drop rate for the MoW is pathetic from my exp, my group and I AoE'd Walrus for hours trying to spawn MoW and while we spawn a ton of them, we never saw Ro's drop, a few cleric and shammy spells but no Ro's :( <p>Warden of Tunare<br>

Since it looks like I can't count on their help in getting it, looks like I either have to buy or get it from the MoW's.  (Ry'Gorr camp is pretty perma-farmed.)<br>

  There is an obscene amount of aggro on this spell. RFS, as<br>
  I've found out, is a great way to pull the mob off the chanter<br>
  who just tashed it or cleric who just CH'd or the shaman who<br>
  just did a mala/slow. For those of you who don't believe the<br>
  uber tuant of this, try it for yourselves. Its a great spell, but<br>
  just be careful when you use it.<br>
