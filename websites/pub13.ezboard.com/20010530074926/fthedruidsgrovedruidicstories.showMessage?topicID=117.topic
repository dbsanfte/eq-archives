He leaned against the bridge railing, cradling his cup of warm elven wine, occasionally sipping from it.  The wind sighed gently through the woods, ruffling his hair.  He closed his eyes, endeavoring to seek solace in the quiet peace of the Greater Faydark woods.  He always felt a bit better, knowing that she was safe.  He glanced again down at the hut, seeing the female figure on the bed move restlessly in sleep.<br>
<br>
     “You’ll wear yourself out, you know.”<br>
<br>
     Tyl started and turned quickly to see his long-time friend Reig come next to him on the bridge.  He smiled ruefully at him. It never ceased to amaze Tyl how softly Reig could walk. That particular skill was helpful in hunting and most recently in the Crushbone war.<br>
<br>
     “You shouldn’t do that. I might have casted something painful.”<br>
<br>
     Reig grinned in the dark, ”Pftt. I made enough noise so that you would know that I was coming.” Surreptitiously, he looked over Tyl in concern.  His friend was not doing well. The morose man before him was in stark contrast to the laughing person that he hunted and fought with in past years.  He glanced over at the enclosed hut.  Even from here, he could faintly see the shimmer of the magical shields on the hut that prevented wild, errant magic from coming out and causing damage.<br>
<br>
     “She’s always been strong.  She’ll pull through this,” Reig quietly said. “The clerics say that the bond between you two is strong.  It’ll help towards her healing; it’ll give her strength.  If it wasn’t for that, you know that she would be with Tunare by now.”<br>
<br>
     “Aye, I know.  It’s just that I wish that things turned out differently.”  Tyl turned towards his friend. “I wish she had gated out in time.”<br>
<br>
     Reig winced, seeing the anguish in his friend’s eyes.  He wished the same thing, too. It had been an ill-fated raid on Crushbone.  There had been rumors that the enclave of dark elves residing in Mistmoore would join their forces with the Crushbone orcs in their war with the wood elves of Kelethin.  So, emissaries had been sent from Kelethin to Felwithe for assistance, but the high elves had needed proof before they would send their forces.<br>
<br>
     “Tyl, she knew the risks,” Reig reminded him. “Also, if she and the others hadn’t stayed behind, we wouldn’t have been able to capture D’Vinn.  And without him, the high elves would not have watched our southern border and we would have been fighting on two fronts.”<br>
<br>
     Tyl hunched his shoulders and looked again towards the hut. “The cost was too high,” he grimly stated.<br>
<br>
     “Tyl, she’s not dead,” Reig said softly.  He shuddered inwardly, remembering what he had seen in the bowels of Crushbone.  What had been graceful, lithe wood elves were now broken, mangled elven remnants. His brethren had been starved and tortured.  Some had hung dead in their chains; others had been barely clinging onto life.  What had been frightening was that all the prisoners were males. At the time, Reig’s heart had dropped, thinking that the orcs had killed off all the captured females.<br>
<br>
     “What they did to her and the others was…..monstrous,” Tyl stated flatly, his voice hard and cold, his hand clenching the cup of wine.<br>
<br>
     Reig drew back, unintentionally reacting to his friend’s intense anger and hatred towards the orcs.  The war had created this Tyl.  He sighed deeply, silently agreeing with his friend.  What was supposed to have been a rescue attempt for their captured brethren had turned out to become a pivotal battle in the Crushbone war.  Given directions by the prisoners, the rest of the force who were not porting out the dead and injured went to where the females were kept.  The state of the females was no better than the males.  Some were dead and others should have been dead.  Many had been ill-used and experimented upon by the oracles with their dark magics.  Reig had cried openly when he saw Tyl’s bondmate.  She had been so bloodied and bruised that he was sure that she was dead. They had taken the dead and the injured and quickly ported back to Kelethin.<br>
<br>
     “Aye, monstrous, but we paid them back and dearly,” Reig said, resettling himself next to Tyl on the bridge.  <br>
<br>
     He glanced again at his friend, remembering that pivotal battle.  After they had gotten the injured to the clerics and had the dead taken care of, the force had returned to Crushbone.  The alarm still hadn’t sounded; they had moved so quickly and efficiently.  Enraged beyond words, Tyl had recklessly ran straight to the throne room.  It was the only time that Reig had been fearful for Tyl’s life.  Reig thought for sure that they would have died together in that godforsaken castle, but Tyl had fought with a maddened intensity and deadliness that had to be seen to be believed.  It was as if Tunare herself had come down and taken over Tyl to mete out justice against the Crushbone orcs.  <br>
<br>
     Bloodied and battle-weary, Tyl and Reig and the ragtag group that had kept up with them had come to where Emperor Crushbone himself was residing.  Reig didn’t even know that they had come upon the orc emperor, so focused was he on protecting his friend’s back.  It wasn’t until Tyl stumbled into him – battle-worn and weakend from blood loss – that Reig realized that the battle was over and they were alive.  And they had done it.  The Crushbone war was over; the feared orc emperor was dead.<br>
<br>
     “ ‘Spring always comes after winter, no matter how bitter.’,” Reig absent-mindedly quoted.<br>
<br>
     Tyl snickered. Reig half-smiled in the darkness and clapped his friend’s shoulders, comforting him as well as he could.<br>
<br>
     “You know, she’s physically healed. The bruises are all gone and there’s minimal scarring.  Even if she were badly scarred, I wouldn’t care. She would always be beautiful to me,” Tyl said simply. “On the surface, she’s whole, but on the inside, Reig, things aren’t right.  I can feel it in my bond with her.”<br>
<br>
     “Aye, I know.  I can tell just by looking at you,” Reig said seriously. “But, she’s a fighter, Tyl. She’s always been strong.  She just needs time.”<br>
<br>
     Tyl shook his head. “No, Reig, I think she’s losing.  Whatever the oracles did to her in Crushbone, they hurt her deep. It’s like her soul was damaged, a soul-hurt of some kind. I can tell that she’s struggling inside against something.” Tyl sighed deeply, “And I can’t reach her, Reig. For all my power, I can’t help her.  Do you know how frustrated and powerless I feel?  So much for the great slayer of Emperor Crushbone,” Tyl said bitterly.<br>
<br>
     “Don’t, Tyl. Don’t do that to yourself,” Reig admonished.  Suddenly, Reig stiffened. Tyl straightened, noticing the change in his friend and looked to see what had caused it. <br>
<br>
     His bondmate had gotten up and had left the magically-shielded enclosed hut.<br>
<br>
     Hearing whispers of bow and arrow drawn, Tyl quickly turned back to Reig, staring aghast at his friend as he nocked an arrow to his bow in readiness to shoot.<br>
<br>
     “Reig! For the love of Tunare, don’t!” cried out Tyl. <br>
<br>
     “Tyl, do you actually think I want to do this?” Reig grimly asked. “I don’t want to shoot, but if she can’t control her magic, you know as well as I that I’m supposed to take her out so that she doesn’t hurt the rest of us. Just get down there and see if she’s ok and has a sound mind.  I have a clear shot from here.”  <br>
<br>
     Tyl quickly casted wolf spirit and levitate to move faster towards his bondmate.  <br>
<br>
     “And Tyl, I won’t take the shot if I have to. Trust me on that.”<br>
<br>
     Tyl ran to his bondmate, fearing that he might be too late before Reig had to shoot her.  If she casted any offensive spells, Reig would have to let fly his arrow.  As he rounded the corner, he breathed a small prayer of thanks to Tunare that his bondmate was still where he last saw her.  She was still standing in front of the hut, looking confused.  Tyl looked her over carefully.  Physically, she was complete, but her eyes were shadowed and a great weariness seemed to be upon her.  He stood a few paces away from her, watching her, wondering if she would recognize him.<br>
<br>
     Slowly, her eyes came to rest on him, and his heart fell when he saw no recognition in her eyes. Then the fog seemed to clear up, and she whispered,”Tyl.”<br>
<br>
     “Yes,” he softly answered.<br>
<br>
     She brought up a hand to her forehead and swayed on her feet.  He wanted to run to her in case she fell, but he wasn’t sure if she was herself or not and so stood his ground.<br>
<br>
     “Tyl, I am so…tired.”<br>
<br>
     “Yes, I know.  Don’t talk, love, you need your strength to get well, to get better, for yourself, for me, for us.”<br>
<br>
     She walked slowly to him and stopped a few feet away from him.  Tyl’s heart stilled, seeing the deep sadness in her eyes.  Sadness. Loss. Regret. They were all in her eyes, and he swallowed hard around a growing lump in his throat.<br>
<br>
     “Tyl,” she said softly, “I need…rest.”<br>
<br>
     “No, Ayala. Don’t. Please don’t go,” Tyl begged, shaking his head, denying what she was telling him. “Stay with me. I need you.”.<br>
<br>
     She looked at him, love and sadness full upon her face. She raised her arms towards the moon and night sky, and slowly she changed. He reached for her, but too late. Her fingers became branches, and her feet embedded themselves into the ground, becoming roots. Her body and skin elongated and hardened into bark.<br>
<br>
     Grief-stricken, Tyl crumpled at the foot of the majestic tree in front of him. Even through his tears, he could see the sickness in the trunk and roots of the tree. He felt a hand upon his shoulder and knew that it was Reig.<br>
<br>
     “Tyl, she’s not gone yet. She’s still here with us, just hibernating.  Tunare will heal her now, through the land.  It will strengthen her in her inner fight. Have faith, brother.” Reig looked sadly at the tree and then at Tyl.<br>
<br>
     Tyl nodded slowly, not speaking and allowed Reig to help him to his feet.  With his friend’s help, Tyl stumbled away towards his hut.</font><P>Ayala Wyndforest<br>
