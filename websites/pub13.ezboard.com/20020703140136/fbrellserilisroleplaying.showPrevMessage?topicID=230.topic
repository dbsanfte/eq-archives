<br>
Aradith looked out over the horizon.  It was just before dawn, the grass coated with a light amount of dew, giving the air a fresh smell.  The sky was splotched with red and orange, as if a great fire burned to the east, and then the the first sliver of the sun's bright light gleamed over the distant plains.  The half-elf stood, walking back to his camp.  He gently roused his companions.  There was Galderon, a fellow warrior, only of human lineage, a brave man and son of a great war hero.  There was Aramdir the dwarf, a cleric who had known Aradith a very long time.  Finally was the one they were escorting.  Elfsong, the daughter of a high elven noble, was on her way to Qeynos to answer a summons from her father, who had been abroad for the past five years.  She had employed the trio, paying them with whatever meager funds she had, but promising much more.<br>
And so their journey had began.  They were now camped in the Western Commonlands, having left Freeport two days previous.  Aramdir sat up in his bed-roll.<br>
&quot;Ye bloody half-elf!  I was dreamin' of ale.&quot; the dwarf said with a sigh.  Aradith chuckled, placing a few last items into his pack.<br>
&quot;Don't worry, my friend, as soon as we get to Highhold Keep, you can make your way to their tavern,&quot; Aradith said.  Galderon, his satchel now packed, walked up to his companions.<br>
&quot;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but her ladyship is a little unsure about walking through the Kithicor Forest,&quot; he said, jerking his thumb in the direction of the High Elf.  Aradith walked over to her, but as he opened his mouth, she cut him off.<br>
&quot;I will not enter that accursed forest.  To think that someone of my stature would stroll through that den of evil is ludicris!&quot;  Aradith fought to control a sudden urge to strangle his next paycheck.<br>
&quot;You told us you wanted to go through Qeynos, this is the only way.  You can come or stay, but we are going either way,&quot; said Aradith, then stormed off, picking up his backpack and heading down the path.  Aramdir and Galderon followed soon after, and finaly Elfsong, as stubborn as she was, went after them.  The hours of day passed slowly, and with little talk.  By the sixth hour past noon, they had reached the pass through the mountains.  They made their way through the cavern, making their way to the Keep.  They rounded a corner in rock wall maze, and around the bend stood five cloaked figures.<br>
&quot;Elfsong,&quot; one of them hissed.  It drew back it's hood, revealing a face dark as night, hair white as the stars.  The Dark Elf grinned at the stricken Elfsong.  Meanwhile, less shocked at the sight, The three companions drew their weapons, wondering how they were going to take on the five drow.  &quot;Kill them all,&quot; the leader ordered, and they sprang.  Aradith easily parried his attacker with one of his longswords, using the other to ward off a second Dark Elf.  Galderon brought his massive sword down, loping of the head of his first opponent.  He backpedaled away from the second drow, then ducked a wild swing of Aradith's opponent.  Aramdir waded into the fray, bashing the head of Aradith's initial attacker with his mace.  Aradith took the oppertunity and opened up an attack upon his second oppenent with both blades, attacking quickly and with such fury as his oppenent had not seen in a long time.  Soon he lay on the ground, bleeding to death.  Galderon impaled another drow, then all three of the companions turned to the leader.  He had drawn scimtars, and when his attack came it was like lightning.  Aradith blocked one of the swords, only to take a boot to the face the next moment, and he stumbled over.  Galderon brought his sword up, then down to the right, scrambling to parry the drow's skilled attack.  Aramdir swung his mace in a wide arc, only to have his attack blocked, and his mace jarred from his hand.  Then a mysterious voice began to chant, and the drow suddenly burst into flame.  The companions turned to see that Elfsong had regained her composure, and also had a very useful talent.  <br>
