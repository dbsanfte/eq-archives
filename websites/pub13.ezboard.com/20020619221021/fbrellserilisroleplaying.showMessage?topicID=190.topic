<br>
 The forest was still and silent as they moved through the darkness of Nektulos Pass, and shifted from the dapple of the wooded hills of the Commons to the shroud of deathly shadow that perpetually covered the Nektulos Forest. They walked together, blue and gold, determined at least to bring a piece of the Light to the forest proper for a few moments. As they passed by the ancient monolith of the Combine, the skeletal remains of former champions of darkness rose to offer challenge. On an ordinary day, Nostramis and Erzebet would have laughed at the assault. On this day, they simply released their magic and prayer, and turned the bones to dust.<br>
<br>
From a distance, they could see the servants of Innoruuk arriving for the meeting. They numbered over a dozen, most of them trying to hide their presence in the shadow of the woods. Tricks of light and shadow were of no use in hiding from an enchanter who had mastered the works of Tasarin and Velishoul, but Nostramis gave them no attention. Their presence was noted, both he and Erzebet were aware. If they thought to spring a trap, it would be the children of Hate that would be surprised. <br>
<br>
Two were not hidden. Nostramis recognized the military posture and formal attire of Subati Razorback, a warrior of some prowess, who stood as their commander of arms. Beside him, was the one with whom he had business this day.<br>
Turning to Erzebet, Nostramis said, “Remember sister, I gave my word. We will not strike first. Still, be prepared for anything.”<br>
<br>
“Brell is with us, brother,” Erzebet said with a peaceful smile. “We have nothing to fear, even in this glade of decay.” Nostramis smiled once, then turned toward the cluster of diminutive dark forms.<br>
<br>
“Nostramis!” a voice resounded through the forest. “Are you prepared to meet?”<br>
<br>
Nodding once more to his sister, Nostramis walked forward with all formality and declared, “I am here Winnower of the Violent Harvest. Now return my cousin’s remains to me!”<br>
Light and darkness approached one another, both unarmed as agreed upon. So far, the Tier Dal had kept her word, but Nostramis walked with caution taught to him from countless seasons of hunting the Teir Dal enemy in these very woods.<br>
They had spoken over the ether of Norrath many times, but had met in person only once before. Nostramis noted immediately that the child that had taunted him so long ago in the Ro-Commons Tunnel had grown to become a woman fine in form, and seasoned in eyes. The difficult lessons of the fields of Norrath lent her eyes a haunting sadness that struck Nostramis as being out of place among a servant of evil. Remembering the deception of her race, Nostramis raised his mental shields and perceived her only as a soldier, a warrior for Hate. His resolve hardened and he strode before her, closing the distance to less than two staves. At her side, Subati stiffened, but his hand stayed clear of his hilts. He brooded at her side like a pit bull, eager for the contest yet held in check by a tightly held leash – the word of the Winnower that this meeting would hold no violence.<br>
<br>
“Servant of darkness, return my cousin’s remains to me,” Nostramis declared with the authority of the Justicier of Felwithe, and a former Commander of the Knights Templar.<br>
Nodding once, Selilya Ka’Draeth held forth a plain brown box and said, “I shall, Templar Knight, but first he has something to say to you.”<br>
<br>
Before Nostramis could take a single step, she spilled the contents upon the ground and firmly uttered one word in the black speech of the rulers of the dead. Before his eyes, the remains of Celestramis knitted together, infused with black tendrils of necromantic power. Nostramis watched in horror as Selilya bowed her head and stepped back, while the skeletal form of his cousin strode forward to stand before him. With the quiet laughter of Subati echoing in the background, the risen Celestramis began to speak.<br>
“Nostramis! Nostramis!” he wailed in a whisper from beyond the grave.<br>
<br>
Nostramis shook his head in disbelief. Behind him, his sister Knight stepped forward and decried the unnatural act. “This is blasphemy! Don’t listen brother!”<br>
<br>
“My murderer…” the shade of Celestramis continued, unyielding to Erzebet’s feverish efforts to pull Nostramis’ attention away form the macabre scene playing out before his tear filled eyes. “My murderer is free…”<br>
<br>
Oblivious to the small golden form gripping his arm by his side, Nostramis stepped forward and whispered, “Celestramis…speak to me.”<br>
<br>
“My father, Nostramis, my own father…” The voice wailed in torment, seething with the emotions of a betrayal more foul than any recorded in the annals of Felwithe. “My father, your uncle, took my life… Nostramis!”<br>
<br>
With that final sound of Nostramis name echoing through the stillness of the glade, the bones collapsed, piling at his feet. Gently, with a grace of movement that oozed pity for her enemy, Selilya stepped forward and placed the wooden box beside the remains of Celestramis. Then she backed off, and waited while the stunned enchanter stared at the pile.<br>
As if from a distance, Nostramis heard the voice of the Thresher whisper to Selilya in the Teir Dal language, “Don’t let him get away, he owes us the Chalice – get the Chalice.” Nostramis ignored him, and slowly placed the remains of his cousin within the plain brown box. Anger rising in him, he stood with the box beneath his arm, and prepared to face down his enemies. His fury was tinder dry, and their faces, one a visage of pity, the other of dark joy, were the spark he needed. Justice cried out for action, and he was prepared to act.<br>
<br>
“There is more Nostramis,” Selilya said quietly.<br>
“Nothing further you have to say interests me,” Nostramis said venomously. “You have kept your word and returned the remains, but you have done so more maliciously than I could have dreamed.”<br>
<br>
Ignoring his words, Selilya continued, “You recall perhaps your time in Mistmoore? I believe you were there for some time, captive to the Princess. What was her name?”<br>
Nostramis’ face eased a bit in memory, then he stiffened defensively and said, “I have made no secret of my time there. All of my brethren know that I was in Mistmoore for nearly four seasons. And you know damned well who the Princess of Mistmoore is.”<br>
<br>
Selilya smiled sadly and said, &quot;I wonder if your brethren know that you fathered a child while you were there.”<br>
Nostramis blanched and Erzebet grasped his arm. “Enough is enough, Nostramis – their lies are not worth listening to. Let us leave this vile place and return to the Hall.”<br>
Subati began to step forward, but the Winnower’s arm shot out before him, halting his progress with the gesture. Like a caged tiger, he stifled his wrath, watched and waited.<br>
“Come forward Maev,” Selilya commanded.<br>
<br>
Out of the shadows, one of the figures Nostramis had so easily discounted, emerged to stand in the glow of light that surrounded both Nostramis and Erzebet. She bore no Teir Dal form, but rather, was a high elf like himself, and looked so much like his mother that he gasped and took a step backward.<br>
<br>
“Hello father,” she said in silken voice, full of the accents of Mistmoore. “I have looked forward to meeting you ever since Celebrindor Ecthalion told me about you. You resemble your uncle very much.”<br>
“No,” Nostramis choked, “you can’t be. You look nothing like her.”<br>
<br>
Maev arched a brow, then smiled and said, “You mean my mother? Perhaps you would like to see my true form before you decide whose line I favor most.”<br>
<br>
In a swirl of blue light and a flash of Tasarin’s rune, the illusion faded and a Teir Dal woman stood before him, robed as he was in Oracle blue.  Nostramis took one look and fell to his knees. <br>
<br>
“Llasna, why didn’t you tell me…”<br>
<br>
Laughter as clear as a mountain brook tumbled from her lips and said, “Don’t be sad father, I have made it up to you. Look!”<br>
<br>
Unable to stop, Nostramis looked up and saw that Maev, his daughter, bore the scythe and sheaf of the Violent Harvest upon her collar. She was one of them.<br>
<br>
“See father? I follow the Prophet! I will stamp our family’s name on the face of Norrath in blood, and with the power I inherited from you. I follow your cousin, father, I follow the Prophet.”<br>
<br>
Nostramis mouthed the words. Then, in another shocking realization, he saw that she spoke the truth. Nospiratus, the Mad Prophet of the Violent Harvest, was his own cousin, the son of Celebrindor. His father had always told him that he and his brother had planned on having two sons each, the first to be named Celestramis and Nostramis, the second to be Nospratis and Celepratis. The horror of that memory, and the knowledge that Nospiratus was the Tier Dal translation of that name, stole all of his strength, all of his will. He sagged, broken and paralyzed, at the feet of his torturer, at the feet of his daughter.<br>
<br>
Stepping forward once more, Selilya knelt beside him and quietly, empathetically said, “There is no more reason to hide the Chalice, Nostramis, please give it to me now.”<br>
Nostramis shook his head and said, “I do not have it.” Subati growled and placed his hand on his hilt, but Nostramis continued. “But I know where it is.”<br>
<br>
With pity seeping from her voice, she said, “And where is it my poor, sweet friend.”<br>
<br>
Without a thought, Nostramis replied, “I sent it to the Everfrost Peaks, to a friend, an ascetic who dwells there. His name is Fian.”<br>
<br>
Subati whirled, and immediately made several hand motions. Beyond the glade, shadows that had gone unnoticed, slipped silently away into the deeper places of the forest’s black heart. Turning back to the tragedy before him, Subati smiled, and emitted a deep, low chuckle.<br>
<br>
Erzebet’s hand was upon Nostramis back, and she said, “We must go brother, now, please!”<br>
<br>
The world swirled about him, as his sanity threatened to surrender to chaos. The hate he had defeated in seasons past with his brother knight, Anthyr, rose to the fore, mixing with his quest for Justice and his defense of the Light. Emotions wracked him, lacerating his soul like a flaming whip. Suddenly, the fury peaked in a burst of anger and he rose and screamed.<br>
<br>
“You shall not have it!” he shouted. “I shall hunt it down, I shall find it first, I shall destroy it!” Like an adder he sprang erect, and Subati eagerly drew his steel. But with his cries echoing from his lips, Nostramis was wrapped in a magic portal, and dissolved into mist.<br>
<br>
“Stay, you can join us,” whispered Selilya, but he was gone. “He will be one of us!” She stated. Then she looked down at the golden mailed gnome, smiled sadly, and turned away. Like wraiths, the Teir Dal moved into the dark shadows of the wood, fading from sight, leaving Erzebet alone in the glade.<br>
<br>
A heavy sigh escaped her lips, and she turned to make her way out of the Forest of the Damned. As she turned, she noted a glint of brass upon the ground. Bending down, she gasped, and began to shed tears of loss. In her hands as she rose, were the eagle and sword of the Templars. With a prayer to Brell, she opened a gate and walked into the light, leaving the forest to brood once more in darkness and hate. <br>
