Been over a year but if I remember right it was Ceradaxas.<br>
<br>
Yeah I did the Nagena thing a long time ago, after numerous trainings, deaths, CR's etc, I decided that it wasn't worth the effort. Kunark changed all that.<br>
<br>
I always loved Palara, no matter what she was doing and where she was going, she would stop to buff me up and chat. She was saving my ass back when she was gathering mammoth tusks for plat and I was hunting calves, mountaineers, and shaman in Everfrost.<br>
<br>
Then there is one old friend who really made my mornings grouping with him as a duo. Many of the old barbarians remember us teaming up for 25 levels and tearing through a lot of zones. Less than 1/2 a dozen deaths between us as a team. He still plays but not as often. He isn't really a hero but someone who has made me look forward to getting on and teaming up with him chatting about RL and such. /wave Byard <p>

I count him braver who conquers his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is the victory over self. <br>

Ceradaxas!!  Haven't heard that name in a long long time.<br>
<br>
Heroes for me...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Grevan</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> One of the first lvl 50 clerics.  I know he wasn't first, but he was close to it.  He was in the first guild I ever joined.  Shining Alliance.  Back then it was called Arcane Alliance.  He was incredable.  Man I was level 20 something and this guy was level 50.  He organized one of the best scavanger hunts I have ever seen.  Over 100 different things you had to bring to him, all obtainable by mid levels, but hard as hell to get.  One item I remember in particular was Gator Skin from a gator in Innthule Swamp....never got that one.  Anyway he grew tired of the high end cleric game back before RoK came out and created a monk on another server....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Calaban</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Pre - RoK monk....this guy new everything there was to know about being a level 30-40 monk.  Calaban, my wife, and I used to hang out together all the time.  God I miss him, he disappeared one day, never to return.  Don't believe he made it past 40 and never saw RoK or SoV.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Rhenvoek</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> He was in SA with me in those earlier days as well, actually he was the guy who did the guild invite.  He was such the master trader.  I espired to be as rich as he was.  I remember him telling us in guildchat that he just dropped 10Kpp on tinkering(pre-RoK, when 10Kpp was a buttload) I happened to be at the bank at the time....I looked at my total plat...110pp I think....I almost fainted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Kamchak</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ishva, Glum, Aragosi  truely what a hero is.  There is no words to describe the amount of respect I have for him.  One of those people I will never forget, even long after EQ is a memory<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Flyncc</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Pre-RoK this guy was such a class act.  One of those guys who stuck with the chanter class even though everyone thought they sucked....this was before everyone realized that they were for crowd control.  Disappeared before RoK. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Citron</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Back when RoK came out and seb was first found, and keys were not soulbound, one of the very first days seb was tried, I was heading there with another group at the time and I see this naked dwarf fighting a hunter....it was Citron, he had died in seb and didn't have spare key.  I couldn't stay to help him, but did have a mith 2 hander in my Backpack that I gave to him...I figured it was better then punching....from then on out Citron became a great friend...he helped me out alot and I so respected him for being the guildleader of KTF and hitting level 60 first...I was sorry to see him quit.  I hope RL got better for him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mopain</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> AKA Ugeth pre-kunark  Spent alot of time with this guy, remember meeting him at the AC camp in UGuk when I was perma camped there in my 20's....<br>
<br>
This is too long already and I have way to many more people that are heroes to me....just going to list a few...and for everyone that I list, I'm sure there is 3 others that I can't think of right now....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sufu</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - who can't love the guy<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Gomb</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The nicest person I know<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Feeanor/Annaa</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Helped me start DD<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Thalitin</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Helped me start DD<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Soeb</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Helped me start DD<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Waladen</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - The most honorable player on prexus by far<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Komos and Palantyr </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- hung out with my wife and were doing fear when I was still was killing Black Bears in EC.  <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dolphin </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->- Who took over DD from me, and turned it into an even better guild then when I was in charge<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Krozar</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - My bud, who deleveled almost two levels (without rezzes) to go on one of my Vox raids, and stood by me while I deleveled Paiyn and Phuglee the day I quit.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Izzac</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - who was the first to quad kite raptors<br>
<br>
<br>
Also I would like to thank all of those originals members of DD(alot of whome have gone on to other guilds or have quit the game) who believed in me enough to let me guild invite them.<br>
<br>
My biggest hero is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DD</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> itself....A guild that was started after RoK came out....started from nothing.....and has fought it's way to the top...not the very top, but within the top ten at least.  It's what I dreamed of when I started the guild and it's what they are now....<br>
