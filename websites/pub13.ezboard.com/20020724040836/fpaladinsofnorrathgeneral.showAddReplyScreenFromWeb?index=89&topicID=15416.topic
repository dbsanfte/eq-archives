for someone to taunt off...<br>
<br>
That would be a very powerful combined skill interaction exceeding anything any other class can do in that situation by some way... If anyone is considering such a request seriously (though I'm not convinced its justified in any balancing argument for reasons already stated), you'd have to resolve that I think to get a hearing. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Like I was saying, ~20 seconds is too much for Paladins.  10 would be enough.  However, I do agree that the combination has the potential to be a very powerful method of saving  a raid from dying to a bad situation (missed heal on MT).<br>
<br>
However, it is very risky.  If you DA a second or two too soon, the aggro won't go to the warrior and everyone gets smashed.  If you DA a second or two too late...well, you're dead and who knows what will happen.<br>
<br>
Do understand that I am not bashing Paladins or saying that the game is nearly unplayable for us as it was post RoK.  I just think a couple of improvements would make us *just right*.<br>
<br>
1) 10 second avoidance disc.  Put restrictions on it or whatever.  we should be able to stand as long as the rest of the melee and hybrids against uber mobs.<br>
<br>
2) Spell lines need a look at.  I think we need a more defining role in the buffing department, personally.  DV series needs an upgrade or something new needs to be put in.  I advocate adding an AC component and a small add to all reists component. (ie: BMB becomes 225 HP, 15 AC, 5sv all).<br>
Add the necro line of undead slows or an undead DS line.  Something...insert something useful.<br>
<br>
3) From the logic standpoint, better mititgation skill caps.  From the balance standpoints, its iffy.  Can take it or leave it.<br>
<br>
Both 1 and 2 would borderline too powerful, without crossing the line.  Just 1 *or* 2 *should* be done. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A> at: 5/3/02 7:21:00 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed Protector</span><br>  Posts: 461<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/3/02 10:21:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15416.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> i think what gilfalas stated pretty much speaks the best argument for it.<br>

yes we can't attack, but guess what, our refreshes in 10 minuites. it drops agro, but guess what? we're compeltely immune to EVERYTHING except death touch. for 18 seconds you can go afk, drink a pop, go romp the sack with the old lady (some of you haha) come back and you'll be sitting there.<br>

<br>
Correct.  The fact that it is unreliable makes it, inherently, not overpowering for Paladins to have.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;thats what you guys aren't getting. those discs do not let anyone tank jack shit, it's a get out of death free card, and thats EXACTLY what DA is. i listed each classes escape ability, look at the positives and negatives on each classes ESCAPE ability. they are very balanced.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, they can tank with those discs activated.  Does a monk or rogue stop dealing goldly damage?  Does a rangers spells stop working?  Does a bards mega helpful songs stop?  DA stops everything that we can do, and ensures that someone else takes the fall before ours.<br>
<br>
The fact is, DA is a general act of cowardice.  Ensuring anothers death to save oneself.  Avoidance does not ensure that the mob will leave you; it only makes keeping it on you much harder.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;each of those avoidance discs have negatives to them as well, LONG reuse, can still be hit from behind. can still be hit with spells, any of this getting through yet? &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct, so why is it such a 'sin' for a Paladin to have this as an option.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;i think what gilfalas stated pretty much speaks the best argument for it.<br>
<br>
everyones skipping over his post like it's the plague, cause they know he is right.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for pointing that out.  I read his post before he editted it and added that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;My guild has 15 Paladins at 59 and 60. Say we all have a 20 sec pary discipline. Properly executed our guild could kill Derakor the Vindicator with no healers. Her is how:<br>
<br>
Paladin 1 Stuns to aggro Derakor and activates Super Parry. He continues to cast stun non stop.<br>
<br>
Paladin 2 starts casting stuns when Paladin 1's third stun is off. After 18 Seconds of Paladin 1's Disc, Paladin 2 activates HIS Super Parry and Palaind 1 DA's, transferring aggro.<br>
<br>
Paladin 3 starts castubg stuns when Palaind 2's third stun goes off. After 18 Seconds of Paladin 2's Disc, Paladin 3 activates HIS Super Parry and Palaind 2 DA's, transferring aggro.<br>
<br>
You see what I am getting at? With 15 Paladins (and my guild has 15 level 60 Paladins now) if done right, we can tank a mob for 15 x 18 seconds or 4.5 minutes without a heal necessary. Keeping each one alive is simply really as the Paladins can LH themselves if need be.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, no more then 10 seconds would be approriate.  It ensures a CH chain can get going, whilst keeping aggro.  That's all.<br>
<br>
However, replace Paladin with rogue in that scenario.  Rogue 1 gets aggro, other rogues beging meleeing/backstabbing limitedly to control aggro.  Rogue 1 activates avoidance when neccesary.  Avoidance runs out and rogue 1 hides.  Rogue 2 then gets aggro and avoids, etc.<br>
<br>
With the backstabs going on and better damage output in general, the mob drops much faster then in the Paladin scenario.<br>
<br>
The rangers will have a harder time executing that scenario if the fire based jolt is resisted, but it may be doable.<br>
<br>
There ya go, now you don't need Paladins on raids anymore.  Thanks for the new strategy.<br>
<br>
Heck, if we're going that route, why not just bring 16 mana burn wizzies along?  You'll have even better results with less effort and timing.<br>
<br>
Heck!  You can tank him for 4.5 minutes with 2 warriors and 5-6 clerics.  Do the job with 16 people or 7?  I'll take door number two, Bob.<br>
<br>
Now, consider that I ask for a 10 second avoidance disc and you get: 2.6 Minutes.<br>
<br>
Now you can do that with 1 warrior and 5-6 clerics.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if people actually had timing as good as what was needed to pull that strategy off, taking lag, etc into account, then you have one l33t set of friends.  The problem with that strategy is, one mistake and it all falls apart.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you see now why our COMBINATION of spells and skills, when adding in a warrior type defensive Discipline would be completely unbalanced?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't consider this a warrior type defensive discipline.  I consider this an &quot;every melee and hybrid, except the defensive hybrids&quot; disc.<br>
<br>
I still don't see the imbalance.  But, hey, if you guys really don't this we deserve it, then so be it.  If no one is going to support this, then it really does not matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;(and my guild has 15 level 60 Paladins now)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess a congratulations is in order.  Not many guilds can match the kind of power yours most likely has, particularly in the arena of warriors.  Consequently, wouldn't it be nice if tier 2 guilds could do anything of consequence without the all-mighty warrior?  Nah, that would be unbalancing.<br>
<br>
<br>
We'll just have to wait a few months until after the caster balancing, where we will be playing catchup again for the next year or so, all over again.<br>
<br>
Expect a preist or two to gain similar or better AoE healing power and enjoy DAing whilst everyone else *tanks*.<br>

<br>
Most other classes mainly use their defensive to escape, because most of the time they aren't tanking. Knights do tank, but if you consider DA their defensive, they can't tank with it (only escape).<br>
<br>
Here's what I think people are trying to get at:<br>
When Lordgoofydragon (don't know if this is a good example, but I like saying it) decides he's going to finish off a rogue after finishing of a warrior. With his defensive, the rogue can buy the raid 10 seconds + however longer he can survive, to get things back under control. That's about 10-15 seconds where no one is dieing.<br>
<br>
If a paladin finds herself the victim of Goofydragon, and she used DA or the /disc, she isn't buying the raid any time since now LordGoofy is going to turn his attention to someone else. In otherwords, people are still dying in those 18 seconds.<br>
<br>
While this may be acceptable for some classes (clerics for example), it really shouldn't be considered the 'defensive' for the games second best tanks.<br>
<br>
I'm curious, Gilfalas, how many clerics+warriors does it take to tank Derakor the Vindicator  for 4.5 minutes? If that number is &lt; 15 then this would seem like a far trade off. X number of well coordinated knight classes taking no damage, could be a viable second option to X-Y total number of clerics and warriors taking damage but healing it up. If not, then the length of the disc could be reduced (10-15 seconds?), so that would be a possible strategy, but definately not the best one.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/3/02 11:25:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15416.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> Thanks Cylria.

<br>
The whole real point here is that if you make Warriors useless or unnecessary then you have made them useless and unnecessary and that is BAD.<br>
<br>
If you make Paladins and SK's nearly as usefull and necessary (which if I read this thread right is what folks are asking for) then your STILL not going to be used because the HORDES of warriors readily available on any server will STILL be more usefell and 'efficient' than we are.<br>
<br>
So, you would need to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> as</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> efficient as a warrior in order to be a truly viable reaplacment <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> for</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a warrior. And, again, once your as efficient as a warrior you, again, no longer need warriors since at that point we would be them with spells. And of course removeing warriors from any role besides damage dealer is bad. It is a catch 22. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105286"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~pfichera/Junk/sigfile.jpg" width="368" height="152"></a><br>

Btw as for those complaining about pallies get ressing spells, pallies had 90% rez capability since kunark. They only added the smaller versions in, so it did not matter much. It just helps the clerics lose less exp when pallie tries to save the raid.<br>

<br>
I think for the most part we are balanced offensively.  We dont do near as good as good as damage, but Verant has ensured that we get the best weapons in game to assist with our damage output.  Any melee class would love to be able to duel weild a few 24/22 1hs weapons.<br>
<br>
Defensively, we could use a little twinking in the uber encounters only.  For the most part I can tank any mob in game given the same support a warrior gets (cleric/chanters), except for uber mobs like gods or dragons, and actually require less support than a similar equipped warrior would need (we require less healing, faster regen).  A small twink to our defensive disc would prolly be the simplest answer.  However, the tradeoff for being able to tank better than a warrior on normal exp mobs vs being able to not tank on uber mobs may actually make us balanced defensively.   <p><BR><p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#CC0000" size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=93296" target=Qualtar>60th Level Dwarven Knight</a></font></p><BR><img src="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/247/83/32478348.gif"><BR><SELECT>

I think our day to day tanking ability is great.  It makes logical sense that our mitigation caps were higher, but we do tank exp mobs well enough anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
