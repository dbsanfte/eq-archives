This should work for these reasons.<br>
<br>
1) It will keep the list moving quicker<br>
<br>
2) It will allow mobs such as Ragefire to spawn more often if it is policy to kill Nagafen within 24 - 47.99 hours after he spawns, rather than 48 - 71.99 hours.<br>
<br>
3) Being as though that most raid crews carry people of levels 47 - 52, rather than the pre-kunark 45- 50.  The number of failed raids are significantly low.  And if a raid fails it is entirely the fault of the raid leadership for going after the mob with a weak raid crew or for not keeping the raid crew in order.<br>
<br>
4) A dragon raid should take no more than 4 hours to do if the raid leadership comes prepared and seriously tries to work the week before/the few days before and hit up their friends lists to see if they can get the required classes they need.  If a raid leader cannot get the required classes to kill the dragon they really have no business conducting the raid in the first place.  4 hours = weeknight capable raid, there really is no reason to have to wait for the weekend.<br>
<br>
5) Under most circumstances if a guild/indy is coming up on the list they *should* be preparing for the raid a few weeks beforehand, if not, then why the hell did they put themselves on the list in the first place?<br>
<br>
6) As some people have said the Brell rules are in place to help facilitate the interaction between guilds and other people.  Many people view that the dragon rotations are a complete joke.  Just because you have waited on the list for 6 months does not give you any special priveleges over the rest of the server.  Any guild that does their legwork correctly can figure out about a month in advance aprroximately what days they'll be hitting the dragon (give/take a week) with the margin of error coming down as each week passes.  If we work to compress this time frame a bit more people will be able to prepare a bit more and if need be can make any special out of game arrangemens they may need a week or two in advance.<br>

Having the option for two days makes it easier for guilds that do not have players that are able to play every night. It also allows second attempts due to unforseen wipe outs or other issues that are not controllable.  Forcing people to have 24 hours instead of 48 hours will not make the lists go any faster. The lists are long not because of the time between each of them but the amount of guilds that are on them.  I personally feel that the amount of lists you can be on needs to be reduced to one not two.  It was two back when we had 4 lists.  Now that we have 3 lists it needs to be changed.  But even if that is done, while each list will move faster, in order to get both dragons in it will still take just as long.  <br>
<br>
Its just a simple fact that there are too many small guilds for a rotation to work quickly.  So either people need to start forming alliances or they need to just sit back and wait.<br>
<br>
Perfect example is Silent Redemption and Watchers.  Both guilds could kill Dain, Vindicator, Klandicar, Zlandicar, and CT without each others help.  But they work together on each spawn.  Yeah its overkill but its fun hanging out with each other and everyone gets to join in on each raid.  <br>
<br>
If more guilds would form alliances and be on the lists together instead of separate it would move alot faster and you would need less and less outside sign ups for each raid.  But of course no one wants to share anything so it never happens.<br>
<br>
Making people kill Vox/Nagafen every 8th day (you can't easily kill them the 7th day as spawn varies by a few hours) instead of a few on the 9th would not significantly reduce the lists.<br>
<br>
Vox:<br>
<br>
39 slots x 8 days = ~42 weeks<br>
39 slots x 9 days = ~47 weeks<br>
<br>
I would guess half the raids take her the first night meaning actual time is<br>
<br>
39 slots x 8.5 days = ~45 weeks<br>
<br>
So forcing people to go on the first day would only save you 3 weeks total.<br>
<br>
Nagafen<br>
<br>
41 slots x 8 days = ~47 weeks<br>
41 slots x 9 days = ~53 weeks<br>
<br>
I would guess half the raids take him the first night meaning actual time is<br>
<br>
41 slots x 8.5 days = ~50 weeks<br>
<br>
So forcing people to go on the first day would only save you 3 weeks total.<br>
<br>
So as you can see you will only increase the turn around on the rotation by 3 weeks over the course of 10-11 months while forcing people to have a set day in which some, if not many, guild members may not be able to make it.  I would also suspect that it would cause more dragons not to die because of being forced to go on a day that does not work out well for many people.<br>
<br>
Sorry but in my opinion the little time saved does not out weigh the disadvantages caused to those on the list.<br>
<br>
My question is, how many are on the list for their 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc time now?  And why are you there still? <br>
1) Is it for epic pieces for the bard/warrior/paladin in the guild?  <br>
2) Or is it for loot?  <br>
3) Or is it for just the ability to fight dragons?<br>
<br>
If it is the last two I suggest you drop off the rotation and head out to West Wastes and have a blast killing numerous dragons at any time you like.  The respawn on the dragons is about 2 hours and there are 28 named that I know of.  On a normal day you can kill the same 6-8 dragons 2 or 3 times.  The loot is far superior and they are in the same difficulty of Nagafen/Vox and up as high as you want to go all the way up to Sontalak who is one uber dragon (he drops a sleeper key talisman).  You will enjoy yourselves alot more than waiting around on the lists. <p><table>

<br>
 The bottle neck for Bards, Pallies and Warriors are all on Naggy and Vox. Pallies have no other choice save two dragons that are 60 or 65 levels although Warriors and Bards do. This forces Pallies to a large extent and Warriors/Bards to a lesser degree to be stuck at -53 level for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Also, the last two or three Naggy pops have been 8days 1 or 2 hours, not the 7hr spawn previously.<br>

That is a LAZY approach to doing it.  Gorenaire and Talendor drop the SAME scales as Vox and Nagafen.   The guy in the Hole drops Red Scales as well.  If all those paladins, warriors, and bards would stop sitting at 52 most would be high enough to kill Gorenaire and Talendor.  They are NOT these uber beasts everyone thinks they are.  All those guys sitting at 52 and not moving up is the CAUSE of the bottle neck.  If they would have leveled like normal they would be in the 57+ range by now most likely and been able to take down Gorenaire and Talendor.  Don't believe me?  Sepherenia sat at 52 for months, finally she got tired of it and leveled up and having never led a dragon raid managed to pull off killing Gorenaire on the third attempt and will soon have her epic.<br>
<br>
Sorry but I have NO sympathy for someone sitting at 52 for 6+ months whining about how they can't get their epic pieces when they could have leveled to 57+ and gotten them from another mob and NOT be causing this bottle neck.  There are two other dragons that have gone pretty much untouched for months now.  Instead of having all these people sitting at 52 they should be leveling like normal and splitting the load up between the other dragons out there.<br>

Severilous dies within hours of spawning.  Also these type of raids can't really be planned in advance.  I'm talking about guilds that are raiding Vox/Naggy with mostly level 50-52s and have some high up members helping with giants before hand.  These type of guilds could easily spend a day in West Wastes and take down some of the lesser dragons and get ALOT of nice loot.  Many of these dragons are Vox/Nagafen equivalents:<br>
<br>
Dragon&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Level&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Special Attacks<br>
Atpaev&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 51&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Cold and Dispell<br>
Yeldema&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 52&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp None<br>
Gafala&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 53&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Fire and Dispell<br>
Hechaeva&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 53&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Cold and Dispell<br>
Vitaela&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 53&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Cold and Dispell<br>
Mazi&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 54&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Fire and Dispell<br>
Amcilla&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 55&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Cold and Dispell<br>
Yal&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 55&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp AE Fire and Dispel<br>
<br>
And there are many more.  They drop various pieces of Dragonhide armor, numerous spells, and 5 AC +4 to all stats and Resists  +10 hp/mana talismans (mini Necklaces of Superiority) or better.<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to try these dragons instead please send me an email with any questions and I'll be happy to give you any information I have.<br>

But what it DOES do is get you the kill when the server goes down twice in a week, like it did this week.  There could have been 2 or 3 Naggy deaths in 3 days if people killed as fast as they could.  But the Friday Naggy raid after a Wednesday patch meant that Naggy was depopped rather than killed. I think that in general 48 hours is reasonable, but it does gall me when raids are scheduled deliberately later than they could be.<br>
<br>
As to the other issue, lvl 52 people not levelling: It's not as simple as laziness.  I think that it is much more about knowledge.  Joe Paladin/Bard/Warrior wants a scale.  He knows they drop off a dragon.  He reads the boards and finds post after post inviting randoms to help kill Naggy and Vox.  He sees NOTHING about Talendar or Servelious or any of those.  The little that he does find out is that they are random spawns that seem to be killed by large guilds - guilds that he is not a member of.<br>
<br>
Yes, Joe Paladin can level up to 55 and be capable of killing these Kunark dragons.  But he doesn't know that he'll get a chance to even try.  Joe then decides to take the slow but steady approach.  He knows he can kill Naggy, even if it takes forever.  He doesn't go to 55 because he may get there and find out that he never even sees a dragon again.<br>
<br>
I'd say, don't wait for email about those dragons.  Post it like mad.  The more people know about it, the more likely they will be to make the leap.<br>

No one is entitled to their epic just for existing in this game.  You do NOT need to be in an uber guild to take down these dragons. Last I checked Sepherenia wasn't in an uber guild.  Most of her sign ups were friends.   Sorry but if you don't have the ability to get enough people to come join you on a raid you do not deserve you epic.  People seem to think that everyone should have their epic just by playing the game, sorry it doesn't work that way, you have to earn it by putting in the effort.  <p><table>

A patch announced at 2 am EST saying servers coming down in 4 hours is hardly something you can use as a reason to change the rules.  This type of patch RARELY occurs.  Are you saying that your guild could put up a raid within 24 hours notice?  Doing that would cause many dragons to go unkilled because guilds can't always have all members online every night.<br>
<br>
If it galls you so much why didn't you put together a raid to kill Nagafen last night before the patch?   <p><table>

Entitlement does not cause someone to work very hard to stay at 52 in order to earn a book.  It *is* work to do that while your friends and guildmates all level you and pressure you to come along.  It *is* work to make a huge effort to show up at Naggy after Naggy for months on end regardless of real life night of week.  I for one have leveled my Cleric from 51 to 54 and a Shaman from 17 to 52 in the time that Dunster sat and worked at getting a book.<br>
<br>
As for ignorance, I for one am ignorant of what it takes to organize a Talendar/any other Kunark dragon raid.  I hear rumors of being 55+ needed, I hear you need several groups of 55+.  I can't imagine coming to the message board and posting that I saw Tal up and asking for signups for a raid that night would generate enough response to kill a dragon.  I imagine it would be killed by an in game organized group in a more timely fashion.<br>
<br>
I believe that any ignorance exists is not of what mobs it takes to kill but of ignorance of the skills necessary to kill Kunark dragons, which I believe is Dunsters point.<br>
<br>
Please consider you are asking these Paladins to level from 52 to 55 (a time consuming task) before even having a shot at getting on a dragon raid from most accounts.  I believe that given the evolution of the Paladin epic and Verants choice to level cap, etc., that leveling to 55 in and of itself is a huge risk in getting your epic if you are in a small guild.<br>
<br>
Please don't confuse these choices with &quot;if someone is that ignorant of the epic they don't deserve it&quot;.  It is not a matter of lazniess or entitlement but one of a very real risk they may never get a chance versus a very boring but known chance.<br>
<br>
I think the most positive thing that could come out of this portion of the thread is to enlighten the community on the virtues of killing Kunark dragons for your Paladin buds who LoH you without a second thought versus an accusation that Paladins who stay at level 52 must be lazy or unworthy of their epics. <p>Mipsy Gigaflop 54 Vicar<BR>

Ask Sepherenia what she knew about Gorenaire, the hardest of the kunark dragons,  I bet she would tell you that she knew very little at the start.  So what did she do?  Asked people that have killed Gorenaire for advice, looked on websites about what it takes to try to take her down, etc etc etc.  Also she had NEVER run a raid of any kind before so what did she do? She asked all her friends and guildmates if they would be interested in helping.  She then gathered every bit of information she could from numerous people and websites and formed a plan.  While her first two attempts didn't succeed they did get Gorenaire down to very very low health.  The third time her and Tatter worked together to redo their tactics and gathered up more people and took her out.  Now Sepherenia has her epic scale and I'm sure that her epic will mean alot to her. <p><table>

<br>
I'm sure Seph is very deserving and proud of her epic as well she should be.  There must be a great deal of satisfaction in having leveled and organized a raid(s) of that magnitude.  Congratulations to her, however, the flip side is not necessarily laziness or a sense of entitlement.  It is being put in a position to make a difficult and unknowing leap -- a position that is easier to say you would leap boldly into than to actually do.<br>
<br>
Do you have any nice URLs for dragon tactics to share?<br>

Would I like to get him his epic?  Sure.  It's a nice sword.<br>
Will I stop levelling him at level 52 just because he doesn't have it?  Not a chance.<br>
<br>
Fiery Defender:<br>
35/40 15 AC 20 Str 10 Sta 15 Wis 10 to all resists 70 HP 30 Mana<br>
Effect of Holy Shock<br>
I think you can also bash while equiped.<br>
<br>
The total stats are nice, but now that Velious is out, there are SO many more options for you.<br>
Here's a prime example:<br>
Massive Dragonclaw Shard:<br>
24/30 3wis 3int<br>
1h slash.<br>
Sarnak Battle Shield:<br>
25 AC 5 Str 5 Sta 10 MR 10 FR 10 CR 40 HP<br>
<br>
Shields sell for under 15k.<br>
I bought the sword from an SR auction for a sum of 42k.<br>
I've seen them sell another for somewhere in the 30k+ range.<br>
I've since seen another being sold because the owner got a better weapon.<br>
Sure, it comes off of Zlandicar, but he dies regularly, and there's already been at least 2 sold on Brell auction board.<br>
Is the damage output quite as much?  Not quite, but it's got a close ratio.  4:5 isn't that much worse than 7:8.  And you don't really lose much in the way of stats all round.<br>
So, for about 50k, you can BUY equipment of near epic quality.<br>
In the weeks and weeks and weeks you level 52 suckas are waiting around to get your books, you could be levelling up, getting loot, and buy the weapon combo I mentioned above in a fraction of the time.<br>
Other prime examples of things to get are the various brawlsticks or slashers from DN.  Lots of them drop per night.  You might not get the same stats and resists, but you can get a BETTER damage output from some of the weapons there.<br>
Anyone ever hear of a Granite Face Grinder?<br>
29/36 10str 10wis 10int.   This has the same ratio as the epic, and you can buy them for 15k in a snap of the fingers.<br>
<br>
If you are serious about getting your epic, you work at it.<br>
Talk to your friends.  Get them to help out.<br>
Talk to some guild leaders.  See if you can get help of a guild if a dragon you need should happen to spawn.<br>
If you don't have the friends to get your epic, you don't deserve the epic.<br>
Gor, Tal, and Sev only have 32k hps.  Wizards wizards wizards.  The lifespan from pull to kill of the dragon will be under 1 minute if you do it right.  Get info from people that have killed the dragons.<br>

I am leveling slowly because I have been taking care of other things in game, such as leveling up my friends/ guildmates so we can raid the planes together, as we are all kinda putzy on leveling.  Not necessarily lazy, we hate fighting in pick up groups all the time and prefer to play with one another, or not at all.  I just needed to clarify that because I felt the tone of this thread has degenerated into who is the laziest player...  anyway to help get it back on track...  <br>
<br>
Also, I could really care less about my epic at this time.  I've always been a weapon and Shield type Paladin and absolutely hated being forced to pick up a two handed style because that's the way the pre-kunark weapon progression went (i'm not number crunching for maximum efectiveness I'm choosing what fits my play style and my vision of my character.  And I have gotten many compliments on my Frostbringer/Fearsome Shield Combo).<br>
<br>
I have placed Alat-Seldi on the naggy/vox lists, 1) as a joke, because we're going to be in DAoC by the time our number comes up, 2) if something does change on the list and our number comes up in a reasonable amount of time, it would be nice to kill the dragon in an effort to get some of our guildies their epic pieces or perhaps even a nice haste item for the tanks.  (you still can't argue about winning a RBB or CoF from a dragon), 3) once a strong continegnet of the guild moves beyond 53 I will have our guild removed (unlike so many of the other guilds that are abusing the system).<br>
<br>
Most raiders do not kill the dragons the first day they are allowed, the most recent naggy slaying is one of those instances and most of last month if someone thought they could push the dragon onto a weekend date they tried all they could.  (one group even violated the rules and went for 4 days.)  Especially with a Dragon such as Nagafen, being the PH for an Epic MoB, it's important that he be taken care of as soon as is possible.  Because Rez sticks are nice. =)<br>
<br>
You mentioned something about &quot;the advantages of speeding up the list by a few weeks over a few months does not out weigh the disadvantages caused to guilds who try and take dragons with a weak raid crew because 24 hours is not a long enough time to assemble a raid crew.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I completely disagree with you on this, ANY guild/indy that is on the lists should be looking at all times for people to help round out their raids.  If a guild is coming up on the list they should be tapping on their friends list and seeing who they can count on for the raid.  If a guild can't produce the necessary folks from their friends list and from friends of friends, I'm sorry, that happens.  Perhaps you should try for smaller game, go hit phinny he drops epic stuff.  I guess I'm looking at it from the perspective that just because you have waited on a list for 6 months does not give you any special priveleges on taking down the mob over any other guild that is on the list because they have also been waiting for 6 months.  <br>
<br>
Twiggie, you spoke about guilds signing up on the list as a group to take out the dragons.  With a 6 month wait you can't bet on the fact that the other guild you signed up with will still be around and the way I read the rules they discourage that sort of cooperation because if the guilds that would be sponsoring the raid change, that spot is deleted.  And it's not an issue of sharing, it's an issue of the list.  Since each guild is able to hold their own spot on the list, why bother signing up as a joint effort?  You bide your time and wait.  <br>
<br>
We need to have some sort of system in place to try and endorse cooperation, and shortening the window of opportunity, will force some raid leaders to say, hey we should ask &quot;such and such a guild that's high on the list if they'd like to join our raid, they've probably been prepping for it, and might be able to send over some folks we need.&quot;<br>
<br>
But in the end, I do agree with you on one point.<br>
<br>
The 1 week saved per month ratio (you used a conservative estimate, i'm taking a bit more liberal estimate on it) is not enough to really warrant a change, I agree the lists should be reduced to one guild spot for any one of the three lists.  I would be more than willing to take Alat-Seldi off of either Vox or Naggy in an effort to shorten the lists, but only when it becomes a policy of the server.  <br>
<br>
So how do we get the policy changed?<br>
