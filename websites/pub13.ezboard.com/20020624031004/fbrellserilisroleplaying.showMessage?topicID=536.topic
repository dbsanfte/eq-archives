Considered to be the only &quot;safe&quot; passageway from the East to the West, many people travelled through it daily.  There was another way, but it required passing through both the Beholder Maze and the Citadel of Runneye  Goblins.    Both were very dangerous places.<br>
<br>
But this passageway was not without it's share of danger.  On one side, the Mucktail Gnoll Clan tried to overrun the pass, and attacked any on that  entered from the side.  And on the other there was a part of the Shralok Orcs overrunning the area.  And of course, in the middle the smugglers made their home.<br>
<br>
The gnolls and the orcs had become so aggressive that the Captains of Highkeep Guard were offering a bounty for each patch of gnoll fur, or orc scalp turned in.<br>
<br>
Hobonus, Eideger, Sunshu, and I thought that this area would be good to make a bit of money.  Also, both Eideger and Hobonus were expecting friends to come through the pass.  Both Tseb and Eideger's friend, Mentor, had sent word that they would be arriving in Highhold Pass this evening, and we had made arrangements to meet them in an inn called The Tiger's Roar.<br>
<br>
Eideger had told me about Mentor, a Wood Elven Bard, I was eager to meet him and hear tales of his journeys.  When we arrived, we decided to take rooms at the Tiger's Roar Inn.  Mentor had spoken highly of the inn itself, and expounded the virtues of the Common Room to Eideger.  I got the impression that both the bard and the paladin liked their ale.<br>
<br>
The Tiger's Roar inn overlooked a small pond that was fed by a beautiful waterfall, it was situated in an area off the main path, but yet close enough to the safety of the keep, and the action.<br>
<br>
With Sunshu almost ready to join the Zan Fi Monks, he had yet to attain his seventeenth season, and his orange sash from the Freeport Guildmaster.  I was thinking about joining a guild myself, I liked to be surrounded by friends like I had been in Qeynos.  Facing the rest of my life alone frightened me.<br>
<br>
I knew Sunshu would be there when he could, but I would not hold him from his dream of becoming a Zan FI.<br>
<br>
I really didn't know anyone already in a guild, other than Eideger.  I remembered meeting his guildleader the week before, and I had liked him.  But only really knowing Eideger, I was a bit unsure of the whole process of guilding.<br>
<br>
We all decided to have dinner in the inn's common room.   As we sat there, resting from the long climb up the ramp, and enjoying the beauty of the view, I asked Eideger about the Protectors of Norrath.<br>
<br>
They had started as a small group of friends coming from all across Norrath and meeting  for the first time in Freeport.  They, at first, merely travelled together fighting across the lands.  Eventually, they formed the guild, and others joined their cause.<br>
<br>
They mainly consisted of Rangers and Druids, growing ranks of Warriors and Paladins, and few clerics and magic-users.  They even had some bards in their ranks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mentor Mythmaker is the highest seasoned bard we have, he is also an officer.  He's been with the Protectors for larger than I have, I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you about our guild.&quot;  Eideger said with a smile.<br>
<br>
I had always loved to hear the tales of the travelling bards that came to the Wind Spirit Songs.  Leading a life of battles and travel is really seemed like a dream to me, I was now living in my dreams.  I really hadn't thought of much else after Sunshu becoming a Zan Fi Monk.<br>
<br>
Yes, we would still travel to Castle Mistmore eventually, and I would meet my parents.  But that journey was still a long way off.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
After the arrival of Tseb and Mentor, the six of us sat in the common room talking of our lives, our goals, adn dreams.<br>
<br>
I did talk about my childhood, I told my mother's tale, but never mentioned her letter or the name of my father.<br>
<br>
Mentor said that the tale would make a wonderful song, and he encouraged me to compose it as one.  He thought my story telling ability had great promise, and also encouraged me to find out the ending to my parent's tale.<br>
<br>
Mentor stayed with us and answered all the questions our young minds could think of.  I beleive he and I would have sat up the entire night talking, if he hadn't noticed Sunshu, Hobonus, and Eideger falling alseep at the table.<br>
<br>
I think those three wanted to make sure I was safely tucked into bed, I really should have informed them that I was a Big Girl capable of taking care of myself, but I was touched by their caring.<br>
<br>
Of course, I was quite tired myself, our long climb up the ramp was not particularly difficult, however it drained me of energy.  I don't think the three glasses of gypsy wine helped matters.<br>
<br>
At first the spicy wine had seemed to revive me.  The liquid fairly danced over my tongue, adn made my blood seem to sparkle in my veins.  But the day's activities eventually caught up with me and I was more tired than I ever realized.  <br>
<br>
That night was the first night I slept peacefully since receiving the letter from my mother.<br>
