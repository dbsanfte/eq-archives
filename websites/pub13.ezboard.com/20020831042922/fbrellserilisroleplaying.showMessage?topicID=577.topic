Don't expect too much from it, I sure don't!<br>
<br>
Xican sat up panting heavily, a cold sweat dotting his brow.  Crystalline eyes peered in to the darkness of his small home.  With a flick of his wrist the candles by his bed dawned a small flame.  A hand rose to swip the sweat from his brow as Xican sat in the darkness, regaining his composure.  finally finding himself, Xican climbed out of bed, and paced over to the window, in silent thought.<br>
<br>
It was early morning, very early.  It had to be three or four hours before dawn, still.  Xican couldn't attempt to sleep, now.  He never could after the nightmares he'd been having the last two months.  They were all stemming from that bastard, Dagarok.  Every night the two had dueled in Xican's dreams, and every night it seemed so real, so tangible.  Xican could feel the pain when he woke from these dreams.  Xican feared for his sanity, lately.  What was causing it all?<br>
<br>
Xican stood in the window for nearly an hour, contemplating his situation, when he appeared.  Dagarok was just outside the window staring in to Xican through the golden helm which hid his face.  Dagarok's hand rose, index finger extended, and motioned for Xican to follow.  With that Dagarok turned and slowly paced out of sight.  Xican knew where Dagarok was.  He knew it all.  It was as his dreams were.  Now it was all coming true, or was he dreaming again?  He had to find out.<br>
<br>
With all this barely registering in his mind Xican made his way over to the closet.  Pulling his tunics aside, he stepped inside the closet, and removed a large and very heavy oak chest.  Opening the chest, Xican's armor was revealed.  As he dressed, the memmories of battle washed over him like a wave.  Slipping in to the 'Nature Walkers' greaves, he thought about his first gnoll slaying in blackburrow, accompanied by his Ranger friend, Bangzoom.  Cramming his feet in to the ill-fitting 'Nature Walkers' boots, he looked back on his exploits in The Wakening Lands with his Druidic companion, Tindias.  Clasping the Silver Leaf belt about his waist, he was reminded of the excitement of raiding the plane of hate with Pyrennius, and prying the belt from one of Innoruuk's minions.  Slipping in to the 'Nature Walkers Breast Plate', he was reminded of the battles he endured with the Giants of Kael Drakkel.  Tugging the 'Nature Walkers' Gauntlets' over his bare hands, and attaching the 'Nature Walkers Bracers' to his wrists, he thought of the times hunting the rogue Giant, Velketor.  Finally, Xican fastened the shield of the great turtle, Lodizal to his back, having slain the turtle, and carving it's shell to a shield for himself, with his family emblem, the blue wolf head in to the surface.<br>
<br>
Xican rose in his full suit of armor.  Crystalline eyes shimmered softly as Xican sheathed his scimitar at his side, a loud scraping of metal on metal filling the air.  Xican knew it was time.  With those thoughts he stepped out of his home in North Qeynos, heading for the alley behind the warrior guild, in Southern Qeynos.<br>
<br>
Xican arrived in the alley to find Dagarok waiting.  The two knew what had to happen this day.  Dagarok had haunted Xican's dreams for so long, and now it would all end here, and now.<br>
<br>
Silence.  There were no words from the two, simply a silent respect for the other's strength.  The two despised one another, but had respect for the others ability.  It was Xican to act first, and break the silence.  He lunged forward, his right fist slamming in to Dagarok's jaw.  Dagarok stumbled back, instantly another fist came crashing down to his forehead.<br>
<br>
Dagarok stumbled backward, almost losing his footing.  He had no time to recover from the initial assault from Xican, as another fist landed square on his jaw, sending Dagarok's back to a heavy stone wall.  Dagarok's armor rattled as he hit the wall, a grunt escaping his lips.  Xican's right fist came down, yet again toward Dagarok's chin.  This time the fist was met with Dagarok's left hand, knocking Xican's punch aside, with ease.  Dagarok began, now.  His right fist reared back, before crashing in to the bridge of Xican's nose.<br>
<br>
Xican was thrown to his back.  A trail of blood began to flow from Xican's nose, dribbling down his chin.  He stumbled on hands and knees, trying to recover from the blow.  His efforts were in vain, as Dagarok's boot came soaring up in to his rib cage.  Xican was tossed to his side by the impact, rolling several times before he managed to pull himself to his feet.  He leaped forward, planting his right foot on the wall, and thrusting himself upward.  Xican's right foot rose up, and dropped down toward Dagarok's head, intent to rip it from his very body.  Dagarok's right hand however, was quicker than Xican.  Dagarok's clenched fist arched up and slammed in to Xican's groin in mid-air!<br>
<br>
With a muffled squeel and wide eyes, Xican clenched his abdomen, pain holting through his whole body, as he fell to the ground.  Excrutiating pain ran over his body like a wave, numbing his thoughts.  Xican slowly rose to his feet, staggering.  Dagarok, was unwavering.  He lunged forward, quickly planting his knee in to Xican's solar plexus, lifting the Druid off his feet, before a swift elbow digging in to his spine sent him back to the ground.<br>
<br>
Xican lay on his stomach, reeling from the blow.  His head raised to look for his opponent.  Xican's head snapped back instantly, as another crushed boot struck his lower lip.  His lip split open, blood now drenching his chin, and dribbling down his throat.  He dragged himself up, using the wall as a support, fingers curling around the hilt of his scimitar.  Dagarok approached him again, Xican could hear Dagarok chuckling, laughing in delight at his pain.  In a sudden flash the metal of the scimitar flashed, the scrape of metal against metal filled the air as it slipped from the sheath.  His blade slashed across Dagarok's chest, tearing a long strip across the golden breastplate.<br>
<br>
Xican was panting heavily, and leaning on the wall, when his gaze met with Dagarok's.  Blood began to taint the edges of the wound in Dagarok's chest, slowly dribbling over the golden armor.  Dagarok was in shock for a moment before he regained his composure.  His right fist came crashing down harder than ever in to Xican's cheek, the platemail gauntlets tearing in to the tender flesh, and smashing against the bone.<br>
<br>
Xican's body was thrown again by the impact.  Lying on his stomach, before he could regain any sense of what was happening, Dagarok's boot came crashing down to the back of his head, planting his forehead in to the stone ground.  Dagarok was pissed, now.  He plucked Xican up by his hair, before thrusting his head forward in to the wall, slamming Xican's face against the stone 6 times, the crunch of breaking bone and blood splattering against the stone filled the air.<br>
<br>
Dagarok's hand released its grip of Xican's hair, letting the Druid's body fall limp to the ground.  A pool of blood began to quickly gather under Xican.  Dagarok's lips parted, as he began that maniacal laugh that had haunted Xican's dreams so many times.  Dagarok turned around began to walk away, laughing to himself.<br>
<br>
Thunder crackled over head as rain began to pour down.  Dagarok came to a stop, his back to Xican's body, his head slowly turned around, blancing back to the Druid.<br>
<br>
The rain pattered down, washing the blood away from under Xican.  He slowly began to stir back to life, pulling himself to his feet.  He stood straight up, right hand rising to his lip, and wiping the blood from his lip, before flicking it his side, plattering to the ground amongst the drops of rain.  Xican's wounds were gone!  Karana's rain had washed away the Preserver's wounds.  Xican stood proud, crystalline eyes shimmering and locking on Dagarok.  Xican's mind opened up, with brilliant clarity.  He heard an unknown voice in his mind whispering to him.  &quot;Fight....Fight on my son.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dagarok was outraged!  He sprinted toward Xican, his right fist once again tensing up, and arching down for Xican's jaw.  Xican's head tilted, the fist whizzing passed his ear by an inch.  Dagarok growled, his left leg bending up and slamming his knee toward Xican's gut.  Xican's own knee rose to intercept Dagarok's knee with a thud, before it crashed back down to Dagarok's right knee cap!  The snapping of bone filled the air, as Xican's foot broke through Dagarok's knee.<br>
<br>
Dagarok crumpled to the ground.  He picked himself up, supporting himself with his left leg.  He screamed out again, his right fist crashing down toward Xican's head with ferocious strength.  Xican's right hand whipped upward, his open palm meeting Dagarok's forearm, and forcing it to the side.  In the same motion, Xican leaned forward, his right elbow crashing in to Dagarok's cheek.  Dagarok was knocked off balance, falling against the wall with a scream of pain, filling Xican's ears.<br>
<br>
Xican's lips curled softly to form a smug grin.  His right foot thrust upward in to the side of Dagarok's head, throwing him to the side.  Dagarok quickly stumbled to his feet, only to meet with a barrage of attacks.  Xican's arms pivoted back and fourth crashing in to Dagarok's chest, and head, multiple times, forcing the larger man backward, stumbling upon his broken knee, but not falling.  Blow after blow, Xican's arms continued to thrust forward, clenched fists tearing in to flesh, bone, and steel.  Suddenly, Xican's hands opened, palms pressing to Dagarok's breast plate, and pushing him backward.  While Dagarok stumbled backward, Xican leaped in to the air, his feet coming together and slamming in to Dagarok's chest, and springing himself up in to the air, flipping backward, to land on his feet.<br>
<br>
Dagarok stumbled back panting, blood tainted his body.  His breastplate dented, torn, and scathed.  What happened?  He was winning!  He had Xican beat, but something happened.  The rain came and it all changed.  How, how did this happen, was all he could think.  Too weak to force the words to ask.  He staggered now, the rain beating down upon his armor, he glowered at Xican.  Silence.<br>
<br>
Xican's lips curled softly, his crystalline eyes shimmeringas he stared to Dagarok.  Slowly his right arm raised, the open palm facing Dagarok.  An arcane power began to churn within Xican, one he had not ever known before, manifesting within him.  The very earth shuttered violently as Xican's power surged forward, streaks of brilliant white lightning shattering around his body, and cascading about his form as he stood, channeling this power.  The earth around him began to shutter.  Peices of earth rising slowly around his form, as the lightning sputtered around him, engulfing his body in an awe-inspiring fit of power.  Suddenly the lightning was tainted with a crimson colour flooding over it.  Streaks of lightning arching and curling about Xican's form, he screamed aloud, releasing the devastating power!  The crimson lightning channeled forward along Xican's arm and through his open palm, a single pillar of streaming crimson lightning cascaded forward in to Dagarok's chest, lifting him from his feet, and propelling him back 12 feet in to the heavy stone wall!  The impact caused a massive explosion!  Smoke and debris filled the area where Dagarok had hit the wall.<br>
<br>
The smoke slowly cleared, the screen which blocked the result from Xican's sight lifted.  The wall's centre had a massive hole, the stone shattered and crushed by the impact.  Dagarok's body was not to be found, only his golden helmet, torn in half, and the edges melted...<br>
<br>
The day came, and people discovered the wall.  Most just estimated the lightning struck it during the storm.  Xican knew otherwise, and as he headed back to his home in North Qeynos, he stopped by the gate, simply glancing out over the Qeynos hills.  A traveler stopped for a moment and glanced to Xican, exclaiming in a friendly tone.  &quot;Gosh, this rain sure is coming down, huh?&quot; Xican smiled softly, and looked to the man and simply said.  &quot;I know...It's beautiful.&quot;<br>
<br>
