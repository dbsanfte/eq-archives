Since you know this and asked for some possible areas to try. I think the best zone to try you first hand at raid leading is paw.<br>
<br>
Paw (3 groups) - all the way down and back out.  For a new raid leader this place is perfect.  Mobs aren't too hard but you will get the feel of what its like to be tell bombed by 15 people at once and everything else that goes on with leading a raid.  Trains will happen in Paw so you won't have a cake walk either.  Loot is kinda sucky but you could end up with a decent item or two (Robe of Ishva and summon corpse scroll).  Most people have never been past the double doors so its a new experience and a cool zone to see.  If you get wiped its not too hard to get everyone back together.  Nothing sees invis or a rogue so CR is cake. You could take some lower levels to give them a raid experience (min. level 30).<br>
<br>
Other possible zones:  Droga/Nurga, Runnyeye, Kael (NOT the arena area, just the area between the two zones, CR is easy there but a bitch in the Arena area).<br>
<br>
As for leading a planar raid,  go on at least a handful of raids (10+) to that plane to learn what you can.  Don't ask during the raid, at least the first 5 raids, why things are being done.  After the 5th raid or so if you have questions ask the raid leader at some other time, they don't have time during or before the raid.  When you think you know everything about leading a plane raid you are about 25% of the way there.  I would not recommend attempting to lead a planar raid until you have led other smaller raids numerous times and have been on many planar raids.<br>

I think raids break down when the leadership fails, so you need to make sure you are holding the reigns.<br>
<br>
2)  Be balanced.  Everyone and their mother will sign up, but remember what you need to be successful.  Think about having the right class combinations, make sure you have redundancy, and remember, at least one quarter of the people who say they are coming wont.  Plan for that, especially in the key areas of healers, crowd contral and pull team.<br>
<br>
3)  Have a desiganted CR team lead by someone you trust.  <br>
<br>
4)  Have the pull team lead by someone you trust.<br>
<br>
5)  You pay, make sure you have enough peridots and port stones if you do hate.  Do not get caught short.<br>
<br>
6)  Run the raid.  Typically, I have either 31 or 37 people with me.  That means 5 to 6 groups plus one.  The one is me.  I normally hang out to the side of the raid, watching what is going on, handleing rolls, and gauging whether or not to shout camp out, and generally keeping track of things.  This takes concentration.  If you are not doing your job of running the raid, you wast time.  This can be the difference between a 12 hour fear raid and a 7 hour fear raid.  <br>
<br>
7)  Be firm.  You will get people asking you to join mid raid, people in the raid ooc'ing, asking questions.  Control the situation, but do it nicely.  If someone jeapordizes the safety of the crew, bounce them ASAP.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pre-requisties</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you want to do it, I recommend you have the following:<br>
*2 computers.  Having a second machine that you can keep an excell spreadsheet open on is incredibly useful.  Very rarely will a raid go perfectly as planned, with 100% attendance.  Planning on paper is fine for the start, but when changes need to be made, nothing can rival a spreadsheet.  It's the  difference between the raid leader that gets tells from alts, &amp; has revised groups ready to go at the start time, and the raid leader that needs to go afk for 15 mins to re-work new groups at the start time.<br>
<br>
*Good typing skills.  You'll be doing a lot of typing.  If you can't type faster than 40 WPM, I really recommend you parcel out duties to different people, as it will be very difficult to handle it all yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Doing the stuff</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You're got the people.  They're grouped up.  You're all in place.  Now it basically comes down to 2 things.  The competence of the raid crew, &amp; your puller.<br>
<br>
Does your crew:<br>
*Assist?<br>
*Dispell all mobs with DS's? (In an 18+ person raid, damage shields will cause an incredible amount of damage.  A simple dispel will save a LOT of mana from the clerics)<br>
*Debuff, slow &amp; snare all mobs?<br>
*Keep mobs in camp. (Out of trees, out of dangerous areas)<br>
*Keep the mobs on the tanks?  It's very inefficient to have to chase mobs around that are ping ponging from caster to caster.<br>
*Respond to requests?  If you ask for mana status, do you have to wait 5 minutes for a response?<br>
*Keep everyone alive?  People shouldn't normally die in a planar raid.  Tanks that will be maintaining agro should be heavily buffed, and have a primary &amp; backup healer in their group.  Messing chanters should have the same.  If healers are OOM, they should be letting the pullers know.  If they're the only group that's OOM, then their group should stay out of agro until it's healers can catch up.  If they're a vital group, they should be getting mod rods/Necro feed.<br>
<br>
These are some of the things that a vetran crew will do without having to be babysat.  With a newbie crew, this stuff will have to be delegated, &amp; people will have to be told what to do.<br>
<br>
So your crew is gtg.  What about the puller/Primary Assist?  They should:<br>
*Be experienced in the place you're fighting.<br>
*Know the MR of various mobs, and whether they can be messed easily, difficultly, or not at all.<br>
*Know what that raid party can handle, or know when to feign off a pull, or take a death to stop a pull from coming in/get CoH'd.<br>
*Does the puller keep a steady stream of mobs in camp?<br>
*Does the primary assist quickly chose a good target?  A crew that waits too long to get an assist is more likely to target mobs on their own, and potentially cause worse problems.<br>
<br>
Mostly, being a raid leader is just about getting the right people together, &amp; getting them to do what they do best.  I enjoy leading raids, because I trust myself to be able to pull wherever we are.  Having a good puller is one of the most important things in having a good raid.  I trust my friends to form a solid core for any raid.  However, I really don't recommend that you lead raids as a puller unless you're really used to leading raids.  I just like having total control over the raid, and total responsibility for it's success, or failure. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhikaruichijyo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hikaru Ichijyo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Green-Eyed Cassanova</span><br>  Posts: 700<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/4/01 2:36:29 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.flspot.com/loa/mb/icons/ico_hikaru.gif Height=84 Width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie Raiders</span><hr size=1> Hosting raids is one hell of a chore.

Anyway, its a hell of chore to set it up. And watch your blood pressure spike as you think of trying this with only 2 Clerics and 1 lower-then-optimal Ench. Relearn your religion when another Ench and 2 clerics fall out of the blue into your lap. Once it gets going though the chores all move to the puller and the ML. <p><font size="-1">Tinyn Tinagyn - Yellow and Green Bard of the 54th Song, on Brell Serilis<br>

Only 2 other things to add:<br>
<br>
1) Do easy raids to start and learn: Twiggie mentioned some good spots.  I would like to add both the Fire Giants, Ice Giants (Permafrost), and Kedge Keep.  FG are in my opinion one of the best raid training grounds.  It's not to hard, but you gotta have basic organization or things can go bad.  Also you will get some loot items each raid.<br>
<br>
2) Speech I have given a few times:  As raid leader, you are the Captian of your ship.  You must lead, be respected and be trusted.  You must give respect and trust those on your raid.  As captain, you make the decisions.  If you don't make the decisions 3 or 4 other idiots will try to do it for you and usually leads to indecision and bad situations.  Listen to advise given you, but remember the final decision is yours to make.  Make that final decision then execute without hesitation or uncertainty.  When things don't go right, as captain you need to ensure CR starts fast.  Learn from your mistakes and move on.  Put a swift end to bickering, complaining, bitching and anything else negative.  Arguing who caused a wipe out solves nothing. Getting CR done and the raid moving again swiftly is what's important.  Keep issues with fellow raiders to tells.  Best spell ever is Translocation, don't be afraid to use it if someone is causing problems and not stopping.<br>
<br>
Most of all, have fun.  If you don't have fun leading raids then I suggest you don't do it.  Raid Leadership isn't for everyone.  It's stressful, fast paced, and you are responsible for making sure 18-40 people have fun. <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucrankie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crankie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/7/01 2:56:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie Raiders</span><hr size=1> i f you listen to adune all will go well. i went on alot of raids before i decided i knew enough to lead a raid. and each raid i learn more and more. i have learned to delegate some things and really enjoy leading from the pull team. i started with fire giants. after 2 successful FG raids without any cushions (meaning super chanters, clerics, pullers etc) i felt comfortable to try fear. lead fear 3 times and all 3 have been successful. i have lead multiple dragon raids. and i love it. i get more enjoyment from raids now than i do from waiting LFG for groups <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /wink. i would follow Adune anywhere and KNOW i was in good hands. if we werent gonna be successful we wouldnt be there. there are few raid leaders i trust this much.
