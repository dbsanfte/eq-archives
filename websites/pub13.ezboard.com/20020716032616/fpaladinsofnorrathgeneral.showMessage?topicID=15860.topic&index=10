<br>
However, if you aren't afraid of asking a few questions, you can quickly find all the information that you want about the game, your role as a paladin, the best equipment to use, etc just by posting a few questions here.<br>
<br>
It seems that many lower level paladins have found this site, and lurk, rather than posting or asking anything.  I created <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/bthelieutenants">The Lieutenants</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> in order to help out the lower level paladins, but unfortunately I don't really have the motivation to keep that site very active.<br>
<br>
My opinion is, paladins are fun to play at ALL levels.  As soon as you can get Ghoulbane, though, being a paladin becomes a real blast.  From Ghoulbane and Instrument of Nife all the way up to level 50 is a wild ride.  At 51 (where I'm at now) things seem to slow down considerably, but I still play my paladin over all 6 of my twinks.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one important thing.  There is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HUGE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> difference between a paladin and a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> well-played</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> paladin.  One can do some stuff.  The second can do almost anything in a well coordinated group.  Reading this site gives you the tools you need to be a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> well-played</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> paladin.  Whether or not the people on your server recognize the benefit of having a well-played paladin in their groups or not, you can certainly make a name for yourself by learning to play your class to the limit of its abilities. <p><div align="center"><font size="2">Aragir Lancot<BR>

(Before that I was on a paladin mailing list - I remember Beldukil participating on that as well).<br>
<br>
I had most of my real fun in my lower levels. It wasn't until the (then) high levels - in the 40's - that I started becoming disenchanted with the class. In fact, there used to be many threads with lower level paladins (20's) saying that the higher level people were just whining, that paladins were a great class (then they'd hit their upper 30's and change their tune).<br>
<br>
Level has little to do with what you can contribute in many cases (although not all - if you're 20th level, you can't add much about raids, AA skills, etc.). Most of the &quot;research&quot; I did was in my 20's and 30's, actually. As I recall, the stuff I worked on then was:<br>
<br>
*stats vs. AC (I was in my 20's when I started doing a statistical analysis of the effects of strength and dexterity)<br>
<br>
*our mana pool vs. our &quot;predicted&quot; mana (I wanted to see how many greater heals I could cast and it was substantially lower than the caster's realm calculator).<br>
<br>
*the great advantage of fast delay over high damage (I think it was Bephsi who suggested that SSoY was better than M2H and people thought he was crazy). Discovery of the magic number for weapon damage came out of that whole discussion.<br>
<br>
In fact, being lower level HELPED with some of this stuff. I did not have uber gear for testing and so my initial stats were low. I could watch the magic number change every couple of levels and the levels came fairly quickly then.<br>
<br>
I will say that there were some paladins who DID believe that the opinions (and, heck, evidence) of lower level paladins was not worth listening too, but that was really a minority opinion.<br>
<br>
As Kleitus, Fenar (great hearing from you last night, btw <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )and others comment, many of us have been participating on these boards for several years now, so it makes sense that participants would be weighted toward the high levels.<br>
<br>
Also, being higher level does mean that you have MORE things you can comment on. You've seen more zones, fought more battles, used more equipment, completed more quests, etc., so you can answer (and ask, for that matter) more questions in a meaningful way.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm very curious about what it's like to be a paladin starting fresh now. So many things have changed that starting from first level must be a completely different experience. The availability of cheap, good equipment... the new spells (Marr, to have IoN at 30!!)... QUESTING for Ghoulbane... removal of the hybrid penalty... effectiveness of 2handed weapons... it must be fun! I remember so many levels when I felt like a very puny version of a warrior. <br>
<br>
I get tells from lower level paladins asking questions about things, or run into them at druid rings and chat with them. Most of them do not participate in on-line forums and most of them do not really know the &quot;history&quot; of their class. They find it very hard to believe that we used to suck badly, and I find that charming and amusing, in a good-natured way. On a few occasions it's difficult not to begrudge the hardships we faced when younger paladins have it much easier, but that's rare. More often, I feel pleased that the stuff many of us had to go through is no longer necessary (and I feel a kinship with those who did have to go through all the crap).<br>
<br>
Anyway... many of us higher level paladins actually can't contribute much to the current experience of a 30th level paladin. A 30th level paladin now is a completely different class than when we were 30th level, so having paladins of all levels contribute is important. As in most discussions here, level isn't as important as the person behind the character.<br>
