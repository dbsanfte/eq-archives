How about some perspective? Let's say the kids go to bed at 9, and you have to be up at 7. So you play from 9 to 11 if you want good sleep. Maybe till midnight. I actually applaud anyone who can work that many hours, pay attention to family (right? ;)) and squeeze in EQ. <br>

Well, it takes a bit of practice. It really isn't hard, as others have said, but the problem these days is actually finding places to do it. With a KEI buff you might solve your mana problem, but if you don't feel comfortable doing it, then don't do it. :p<br>

In addition, many level 60 druids don't substantially benefit from the change.  I, having realized the futility long ago, rarely cast healing spells.

Not to mention if you're in a camp requiring slow, there's probly going to be a chanter there&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I think this point has already been addressed, unless you refuse to accept the fact that Shamans dont require the support in another class(altho they are 'secondary healers' just like Druids are) to heal in way more places.  Can you promise us theres going to be an enchanter?  Its like saying theres probly going to be a cleric.  Or i can say theres probly going to be a Shaman.  Those are just silly presumptions, and lets say my silly presumptions are correct.  Then the Druid will never be picked anyways, since the cleric and shaman DONT need the support.  Why would a group pickup 2 healers when they can just grab 1 capable one, and replace the other slot with more dps.  <br>
<br>
Its ironic whenever people make this point, they can never distinguish between being reliant on another class, and being self sufficient.  Being self sufficient is a huge advantage.  If you think its perfectly acceptable for a Druid to rely on other classes when a Shaman doesnt, then you clearly show a double standard against Druids.  They are both 'secondary healing classes' afterall.<br>
<br>
&quot;You clearly have absolutely no experience with canni. It's good, but not even close to doubling your mana regen. Unless of course you haven't learned that sitting increases mana regen?&quot;<br>
<br>
It depends what Canni it is, and what kinda regen items they have.  A Shaman gets a better mana regen rate through the use of Canni&gt;whatever regens items/Regens&gt;Torpor(if they have it) than a Druid does of equivalent lvl with his own mana regen including sitting.  Dont you think if sitting gave better mana regen the Shaman would be sitting instead of Canni'ing?<br>
<br>
Canni V is a one shot 3/4 of their life bar for like 2m.  They just repeat this with Torpor(200 mana for 1200's heal, neg effect makes no difference whatsoever) and its literally endless.  Sure, its an AA skill, but acquirable.<br>
<br>
btw, i only know one shaman with Cann V that i've grouped with a few times.  All i see is him running around pulling, constantly casting, and every once inawhile i'll see a big hit to his life bar like he just got hit with a huge nuke.  Heh, the first time i saw it i started patching him thinking he got nuked.  Then he Torpors himself back to full.  Never HAS to sit, and has mana whenever he needs it.  I'll take it over our sitting mana regens anyday of the week / <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A> at: 8/2/02 9:03:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Baron Hierophant<br><center>of The Grove</center></span><br>  Posts: 1163<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 8:55:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> L1ndara said--<br>

&quot;Monk pulls a train in Chardok, shaman drops 75% slow on them, it's as if there were 2 mobs there, cleric keeps everyone healed and they thank god they didn't have some lame @#%$ druid in the group who can do nothing but evac them and waste their time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Can I ask why you're not dropping multiple 1200-2k+ dmg spells on each mob?  Or regenning?  Or snaring?  If you really want to get ugly, I would call that whole group you pointed out as being a waste compared to the 2 druid, cleric, enchanter, 2 wizard AoE group I did in Chardok that was killing 20+ mobs per pull.  There is no perfect group, or perfect class.  Hell, my all druid group in SF last night outpulled and outkilled the other 4 guild groups present while camping Rage.  There are so many variables in any given situation in this game that I consider it totally unfair to write the druid class off as useless.  I most certianly am not useless, and I know how much I impact group dynamics of a huge selection of group make-ups, sizes, and in a variety of locations.<br>
<br>
&quot;A group with 50% downtime because of a druid's healing will have 0 downtime with a shaman even if the shaman never casts a single slow and never torpors anyone but themselves&quot;  <br>
<br>
and then in the same post....<br>
<br>
&quot;I find the meleers have gone up just as well and either they just don't need me healing&quot;<br>
<br>
So...which is it?  Can you not heal well enough, so your useless as a healer, or are tanks so good that they don't need healing?  I find this double talk in alot of &quot;bitter druid&quot; posts.  You simply cannot have it both ways.  On one hand, monks and warriors solo beter than druids!  And in the next post it's a complaint that you can't keep a warrior healed.  There's way to much class envy out there scewing people's opinions and outlook.<br>

<br>
Hmm, maybe because Druids only get the benefit of 1 mana regen in exp groups, and the dps they do compared to melee is a joke.  Why would a druid be in the group in the first place for nuking?  They wont, it'll be a rogue or some otehr melee'sh class that doesnt need mana to maintain their dps.  More than likely the Druid would be healing in this scenario, Druids ARENT picked up for dps in exp groups.  Btw, rangers, sks, bards, necros, wizards can snare as well.<br>

<br>
Oh cmon, are you telling us Druids are regularly invited into these AE groups?  Another rare example to prove a bad point.  There are such thing as 'better' groups, its so naive to believe otherwise, and i'll go further into it in your latter examples.<br>
------------------------<br>
<br>

<br>
LOL, we're talking about SF here, another rare example to make a point.  Can you make a point using a 'normal' scenario?  I dont think you can.  Its always some scenario where everything has to be perfect for the druid, and then you act as though its the norm.  First of all Druids make the best pullers in SF, and obviously a all druid group will outpull any group there.  Hell, 60 Druids are rarely in SF anyways, if it werent for RF.  Why do you feel the need to exxagerate scenario's just to make your points?  Its like you point out scenarios that druids are a part of 2% of the time and act like we're doing these things everyday.  You put a full druid group just about anywhere else, and they'd suck next to a well balanced one.  Most of us happen to be speaking about common scenarios, not scenarios that occur once a year.  Your whole perspective may be positive, but its silly.<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
You realize theres a difference between velks spiders and maybe something like Rare Hall in OS, right?  So why cant both those statements you quoted be correct?  Obviously they can.  Futhermore, its not about envy, its about balance.  I'm sorry if you enjoy being screwed over, or becoming outdated.  Druids here have made points using facts in common scenarios.  We dont make points saying how great we are in scenarios that occur 2% of the time if that.  Your points are just like the people telling us how wanted we are for evac, even worse since yoru scenarios are even rarer than that.  Its just rediculous that you claim to know how desired we are when you've already admitted you dont do pickup exp groups.  Then how would you know about desirability when you play in a sheltered environment?  You dont.<br>
<br>
And regardless of what points you wanna make, its fact that Shaman are labeled in the same category as Druids, 'secondary healing priest classes'.   So why should one be able to self sufficiently heal in way more places than the other?  Furthermore, why should only 2 classes be able to self sufficiently heal in exp groups anyways?  When there are 3 choices to replace the TANK role of a group(war, sk, pally), and even other melee can even be substituted into a tank role if need be, but Druids are supposed to need the support?  Theres clearly a double standard here, and its amazing that you dont see it.  <br>
<br>
The bottomline is groups should be able to get started instead of having to wait on certain classes for support.  The more i think about a Cleric thinking they should be requried in every group, the more i think how rediculous and selfish it is.  So their need for being wanted should take priority over the gaming experience of 5x's as many other players.  Gimme a break.  I'm willing to give Clerics the franchise on raids(which is enough) or even hard places like CT, but they definitely shouldnt be requried in every exp group which is rediculous for them to even whine about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Hierophant<br><center>of The Grove</center></span><br>  Posts: 2078<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 10:09:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=67>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://lag9.com/rtfm.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> Broomhilda says:  <b><i>the dps they do compared to melee is a joke.

<br>
Maybe because druids can do great DD damage now, and regain it faster than ever?  Or are you so blinded by bitterness and negativity that you haven't even tried it?<br>
<br>
Since you mention CT:  with an enchanter, a level 60 druid can easily keep the whole party healed in any of the main fighting areas.  Or, if another healer is present, that same druid can drop moonfires and regain back the mana in about 5 ticks, giving constant DPS (with no breaks) in the mid 40s or large doses of DPS for big pulls.  Given a small delay between pulls, the druid's DD power will be right up there with the average tank.<br>
<br>
Sure, a level 60 shaman can heal more efficiently than the druid, and a shaman could stand a chance without an enchanter because the shaman has slow.  But if you have an enchanter (and no cleric of course, they are unnecessary), the shaman can only serve in a weak offensive role, whereas the druid shines with high power DD, faster backup heals, and an HP/AC buff that benefits all party members.<br>

<br>
When i'm invited into a group as a healer, i heal.  If a cleric or another heal is there, i nuke, but rarely am i invited into groups for taht purpose.  Maybe you should try playing a Druid in an exp group, and see just how much dps they can put out in comparison to a melee?.  Are wizards = rogues?  No, not even close.  Why?  Because casting classes requrie mana, and i have no idea where you get this &quot;regain it faster than ever&quot; since all i really have is potg + either kei or c2 or mana song.  Very rarely kei/C2 + mana song.  So sure i've tried it and i can tell you from experience my dps comes nowhere close to a rogues, rangers, monks, beastlords, war's, etc. mostly due to mana regens.  Our dps is solely based on mana, whereas a melee class doesnt have that issue.  Why are mages probably the best dps casting class?  Because of their meleeing pet.<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Since you mention CT: with an enchanter, a level 60 druid can easily keep the whole party healed in any of the main fighting areas.

<br>
I strongly disagree but even then are you talking about a warrior or rogue when you say 'tank'?  I'd really love to know what kinda mana regens your talking about here, because i know as fact a Druid cannot maintain the same dps a damaging melee class can do unless they have the benefit of raid type of mana regens(kei+manasong+manadumps+modrods).<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure, a level 60 shaman can heal more efficiently than the druid, and a shaman could stand a chance without an enchanter because the shaman has slow. But if you have an enchanter (and no cleric of course, they are unnecessary), the shaman can only serve in a weak offensive role, whereas the druid shines with high power DD, faster backup heals, and an HP/AC buff that benefits all party members.&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm, the whole point for the Shaman in that role is defensive.  To trivialize mobs with slow, then heal.  Thats what 'secondary healing classes' are supposed to do correct?  Or are they regarded as damaging offensive classes for the most part?  Regardless, i stand by the point that a Shaman is a self sufficient healer when a Druid isnt, but they are both regarded as 'secondary healing priest classes'.  Argue that please.  Btw, Shamans can melee buff better than any class so please dont bring our second rate potg buff into this.<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Jack of all trades, sound familiar? &quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah lol, and its exxagerated everytime somebody tries to throw it in our face.  In regards to every point you made i question the amount of mana regen that your implying that can out dps melee.  Its not gonna happen unless in unusual circumstances.  But thats what caster balancing is for i hope at least.<br>
<br>
btw, its a myth i believe.  There are many classes that can do many things.  That chart you made even showed other classes have close to the amount of abilities Druids have, altho you came to a biased conclusion due to the importance you placed on abilities.  The 2 main things a Druid can do and are wanted for, despite being called 'the jack of all trades' are nuking and healing.  Only 3 classes can heal for the most part, there are many options in terms of dps that are better.  So you tell me what role Druids are picked up for most of the time?  I'll tell you thruogh experience, its not dps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufiremynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Firemynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Might be Housebroken</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 10:55:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> Hmm.. well I don't fit into the &quot;non 60&quot; category but I've not seen any noticeable difference that I could attribute to the 10% penalty being removed. Besides, IMO that was a long-needed reversal of a nerf, much moreso than it was a promotion of class/priest balance. <br>
<br>
I just shake my head when a druid describes how they healed for 2k+. What they're referring to is a low-percentage/random/passive effect, so there is absolutely no meaningful way to factor such &quot;crit&quot; heals into our ability to sustain a group over time. <br>
<br>
Actions speak louder than words. Verant SAYS we're a priest class, but here's what they've DONE:<br>
<br>
-- Have made druid nukes at high level relatively more mana efficient than druid healing at high level.<br>
-- Introduced mage focus items which can improve our direct damage output, but cannot improve our healing output.<br>
-- Added focus effects to equipment, but made it much more difficult to obtain Heal III items than those types which enhance our ability to deal damage.<br>
-- Gave druids a healing upgrade at 60th level that provides no better mana efficiency than heals of lesser level.<br>
-- Gave shamans a significant means of mitigating the amount of damage taken (slow = reduced need for heals), without giving druids any significant damage mitigation ability.<br>
-- Gave necros, paladins, and clerics the ability to quickly heal group damage, while limiting druids to regeneration spells that heal each groupmate a maximum of 150 hit points per real-time minute. [cast a ~150 nuke on yourself and see what a small chunk of the health bar it really is ... then realize that amount as the maximum healing benefit of our best group regen]<br>
<br>
The ONLY thing Verant has DONE for druid healing, is lifting a piddling 10% penalty that had outlived its intended purpose a long, long time ago. <br>
<br>
If you want to say Nature's Recovery is something they did for us, you'll need to a.) fix the spell by reducing its huge recast time and condense its duration; and b.) make the spell more available. Otherwise NR is very much a moot point in any discussion of druid healing across the board, and certainly not on par with most other 60th level spells.<br>

Mental Clarity, Stalker, a few Flowing Thought items, KEI, PoTG, horse.  No bard, no mage.  I can gain back a Moonfire in 30 seconds or less, because in addition to all that great regen, I only use up an average of 75% of the listed spell's mana.<br>
<br>
<b><i>I strongly disagree but even then are you talking about a warrior or rogue when you say 'tank'?</b></i><br>
<br>
By "tank" I mean warrior, shadow knight, and paladin.  At level 60, these classes put out roughly 40 to 90 DPS depending on their equipment level.  You're putting out mid 40s in DD damage alone, or more if you're willing to take a mana hit.  If you really want to max out your DPS, you can throw in damage shields and BooBoo for a few extra DPS.<br>
<br>
At the same time, you can keep up free 15/tick regen, and with AA skills and focus items, Nature's Recovery heals an added 30/tick for 5 minutes, with a heal-to-mana ratio of 6-to-1, rivaling Torpor.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Shamans can melee buff better than any class so please dont bring our second rate potg buff into this.</b></i><br>
<br>
Shaman stat buffs = useless, because every warrior has over 200 STR, and if they don't, your own STR buff will bring them there.  Not like STR makes that big a difference anyway, but that's another topic.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, PoTG = 470 more HP (for casters too) + 6 mana/tick = useful to both tanks and casters.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Umm, the whole point for the Shaman in that role is defensive.</b></i><br>

LOL! Shamans can buff better (including HASTE), heal better, DPS better, solo better, regen mana better, make a better pet, make potions with a variety of benefits (better? oh wait, we can't do that at all).<br>
<br>
What can druids do better than shamans? Snare, port, and track (well, 'cept those shamans with ShowEQ). Wizards can do both of those; other classes can snare, and items with proc/click snare are available for just about anyone.<br>
<br>
Oh, you forgot to include our &quot;globe&quot; spell line in your list. We can definitely cast that better than shamans. <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://lag9.com/biggrin.txt"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> Of course, using our summoned light source ties up an equipment slot, where shaman's &quot;sight&quot; line doesn't. <br>

-------------------<br>
&quot;By &quot;tank&quot; I mean warrior, shadow knight, and paladin. At level 60, these classes put out roughly 40 to 90 DPS depending on their equipment level. You're putting out mid 40s in DD damage alone, or more if you're willing to take a mana hit.

<br>
I dont know the exact figures for those classes, but i will say comparing us to the 'TANK' class as in war's, sks', pally's is the wrong comparison.  The tank is picked like a healer is picked.  Meaning theres usually one of these in every group, the 'TANK' role isnt often substuted for a Druid if they cant find one.  Your point was about adding a druid for dps so a fair comparison would be a Druid vs rogue, ranger, monk, beastlord, etc. which is the whole reason why i asked what you meant by 'tank'.  <br>
----------------------<br>
&quot;At the same time, you can keep up free 15/tick regen, and with AA skills and focus items, Nature's Recovery heals an added 30/tick for 5 minutes, with a heal-to-mana ratio of 6-to-1, rivaling Torpor.&quot;<br>

<br>
Heh, you do realize Focus is a 405 hp buff correct?  That its also a significant str and dex buff?  Shamans also can haste.  What about Avatar?  And your honestly saying Shaman buffs are useless?  Gimme a break.  Why do you think primal is so great for melee?  And i thought you knew the Shaman class better than most, unless you conveniently left that out.<br>
---------------------<br>
&quot;Precisely. A shaman is better than you in one area, but you are good in many areas.&quot;<br>
<br>
For what role?  For a dps role we're never picked for because there are much better choices?  I dont think your seeing the big picture here.  We're picked up for healing most of the time because tehre are only 3 clsses that can heal.  There are more than double that number that can out dps druids so why would a druid be picked up for it?<br>

<br>
Perception often carries more weight than reality when forming an opinion. Vowelumos has benefitted from a Heal III item and a 10% healing increase (penalty removed), both within a relatively short period of time, so is seeing what he/she perceives to be a significant bump in healing over the past few months. <br>
<br>
The specific spell being used also factors into that perception.<br>
<br>
Those of us without a Heal III item and who use CB for quickest healing, are seeing that 10% reflected as 40ish points of extra healing per cast.  Playing main healer most of the time, Vowelumous is likely using Sup Heal as his/her primary heal spell; adding in the Heal III item, seeing an extra 120+ extra points per cast.<br>

A Shaman gets a better mana regen rate through the use of Canni&gt;whatever regens items/Regens&gt;Torpor(if they have it) than a Druid does of equivalent lvl with his own mana regen including sitting. Dont you think if sitting gave better mana regen the Shaman would be sitting instead of Canni'ing?&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Shamans sit AND canni.  Cast canni 4, sit, get the med tick, stand, repeat.  Thats over 100 mana/tick before other buffs and spending mana on healing.  Many shamans don't bother sitting though, happy with the &gt; 80 mana/tick from just canni.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Canni V is a one shot 3/4 of their life bar for like 2m. They just repeat this with Torpor(200 mana for 1200's heal, neg effect makes no difference whatsoever) and its literally endless. Sure, its an AA skill, but acquirable.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Yeah, it's lovely how everyone but druids got mana boosting AA and spells in addition to MC with Luclin.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Can I ask why you're not dropping multiple 1200-2k+ dmg spells on each mob?&quot;<br>
 <br>
  My point was replace the shaman or cleric with a druid and you're @#%$.  8 12k hp mobs are not in the least impressed by being moonfired but 75% slow goes a long way to keeping the party alive and the mobs dead.<br>
 <br>
&quot;If you really want to get ugly, I would call that whole group you pointed out as being a waste compared to the 2 druid, cleric, enchanter, 2 wizard AoE group I did in Chardok that was killing 20+ mobs per pull.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Uh huh.  We both know the druid is a bad, xp sucking, fit in that group to begin with so using it as an example shows how desperate you are.  Regardless the deeper mobs aren't AE stunnable for AE groups.<br>
 <br>
&quot;So...which is it? Can you not heal well enough, so your useless as a healer, or are tanks so good that they don't need healing?&quot;<br>
 <br>
  If a group has 50% downtime created by the druid being the primary healer, the druid is useless as a healer.  If a tank can solo a place they need little or no healing definetly less than they'd get by giving half their XP to a druid.  My point, which has been clearly stated but you obviously try not to comprehend, is that druid healing is bad enough that it's generally either not needed or it's not sufficient and the times where it's actually a benefit to the group are few and far between.  Even clerics are complaining they're just not needed for healing for anything short of CT or or Ssra, and for the most part druids can't be primary healer in either of those places without a shaman actually doing 75%+ of the healing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalyenatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talyena Trueheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Might be Housebroken</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 3:17:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Keep a constant regen on the main tank of 45/tick for almost no cost<br>

Druids can't heal effeciently in a real group where the tank is actually in danger of dying every single fight. We can heal in groups where the mobs are weak and basically we just up the speed some.

A shaman can easily match a druid for damage output. They regen mana much faster, they have better dots, they have a much better pet, their epic dot will do damage faster than ours, and even equipment wise they can nuke while we get a small dot. Their backup heal is exactly the same as ours, so I don't know where you get druids having a faster backup heal.

BS. Sorry, but that is the only way to respond to that. Group focus gives 430 hp, 67str, and 60 dex. That is hardly a useless buff. Group stamina gives 50 stamina which is 300 hp for any level 60 warrior with 205 stamina or less (330 if they have ND 3). So, they can give more hp, more atk, and a better chance of weapons proccing too. They can also increase your agility by 52 which will raise your ac. And if your melee stats need more, primal essence adds 20 to all melee stats. Don't compare druid buffs to shaman buffs, there is no comparison. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Hierophant<br><center>of The Grove</center></span><br>  Posts: 2082<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 9:11:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://lag9.com/rtfm.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> I think the "bitter druid" campaign has gotten a bit out of control.

Broomhilda, you conveniently missed my point.  <b>Assume</b> for the sake of argument that your group has an enchanter.  This is not such a wild assumption.  Now, the shaman's desirability plummets.  No matter how much mana regen they have, shamans have low damage output.<br>

<br>
<b><i>Of course the funniest part is the suggestion that a druid will be nuking and healing at the same time.</b></i><br>
<br>
Not funny at all.  In many places, Regrowth and Nature's Recovery -- taking an insignficiant amount of mana -- cover most of the healing when your enchanter is slowing.  Then you can heal, nuke, and buff, all at the same time.<br>
<br>
<b><i>BS. Sorry, but that is the only way to respond to that. Group focus gives 430 hp, 67str, and 60 dex. That is hardly a useless buff.</b></i><br>
<br>
It's useless for the casters, since it doesn't stack with shielding, and has no mana regen.<br>
<br>
As for tanks, it's less HP than POTG, and the stats are wasted because most tanks already have all stats maxed out.<br>

vowelumos says:  <b><i> People saying removing the 10% penalty has no real impact on day to day game play, just do not hel in exp groups period. It has made a huge difference. There is no question.</b></i><br>
<br>
I wouldn't say the 10% penalty removal has made a <b>huge</b> difference.  It has made a small, but noticeable, difference.  However, combined with all of the improvements in Luclin, druids have gotten a pretty big healing boost. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 8/2/02 9:20:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gardener in the Grove<br>Admin au naturel</span><br>  Posts: 2282<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 9:52:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cityviewsoftware.com/jennifer/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A ? for non 60 druids regarding 10% healing penalty remo</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Jack of all trades, sound familiar?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think this point has already been addressed, unless you refuse to accept the fact that Shamans dont require the support in another class(altho they are 'secondary healers' just like Druids are) to heal in way more places. Can you promise us theres going to be an enchanter? Its like saying theres probly going to be a cleric. Or i can say theres probly going to be a Shaman. Those are just silly presumptions, and lets say my silly presumptions are correct. Then the Druid will never be picked anyways, since the cleric and shaman DONT need the support. Why would a group pickup 2 healers when they can just grab 1 capable one, and replace the other slot with more dps. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Find me a Shaman that can effectively at level 57, buff, slow, debuff, heal, and canni dance to keep mana up.  So that pulls can continue at a desired rate.  They fall behind without support, much like a Druid!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It depends what Canni it is, and what kinda regen items they have. A Shaman gets a better mana regen rate through the use of Canni&gt;whatever regens items/Regens&gt;Torpor(if they have it) than a Druid does of equivalent lvl with his own mana regen including sitting. Dont you think if sitting gave better mana regen the Shaman would be sitting instead of Canni'ing?<br>
<br>
Canni V is a one shot 3/4 of their life bar for like 2m. They just repeat this with Torpor(200 mana for 1200's heal, neg effect makes no difference whatsoever) and its literally endless. Sure, its an AA skill, but acquirable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Canni 1 actually has the best mana - HP ratio.  Secondly how many 57 Shaman have Canni V?  NONE!  It's not possible.  It's a 59 AA skill, and requires a LOT of work.  <br>
<br>
Secondly they won't have torpor.  It's a SIXTY spell!  Much like NT.  We're supposed to be looking at the 51 - 59 spells in this thread.  Stay on topic.  <br>
<br>
Canni V is 1947 (I think) HP of damage.  Few Shaman unbuffed actually have that many HP, between slowing and debuffing, they also run the risk of taking aggro and dying almost immediately.<br>
<br>
Now, let me explain about Canni!  Canni is not better than medding regardless of your HP or Regen, or your ability to cast torpor.  Canni's true form of manaregen comes from Canni dancing!  What's Canni Dancing you ask?  I'll tell you!<br>
<br>
You see Canni dancing is when you click the cannibilize button, and you wince.  You take HP damage and in return gain a small amount of mana.  The spell takes 2 seconds to cast, leaving the Shaman with 4 more seconds to sit, so that when the server and his computer send the information (once every 6 seconds) to refresh his mana/HP supply, it recognises him as sitting, so he gets the bonus racial sitting HP regen, and the manaregen of a regularly meditating caster!<br>
<br>
Given between the 2 seconds to cast cannibilize and the time it takes to sit down, with free time to make sure you get the &quot;sitting&quot; time, the Shaman is left with very little time to cast any useful spells.  Therefore, Canni dancing is a method of pure mana regen, and requires the full attention of the Shaman currently trying to regain mana.<br>
<br>
You see...Shaman manaregen doesn't come form simply canni'ing.  They need to canni dance to be gaining any real improvement, as simply cannibilizing (depending on their HP/HP-regen) can not be done quicker than the amount of incoming mana from medding normally.  Therefore, unless Shaman have a higher manaregen while sitting, thus requiring a higher meditate skill, without canni-dancing which as shown above requires full attention and can't be done during pulls, Shaman have no advantage over Druid's or other caster classes!<br>
<br>
Of course, it's easy to show stats, and give explanations based on what you think.  Trying playing a Shaman with Canni!  I do.  I can tell you, it's not as great as Druid's like to think it is. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A> at: 8/3/02 5:10:22 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=28037.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=28037.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=28037.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=28037.topic&start=81&stop=96>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=28037.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=28037.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28037.topic&index=80><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=28037.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=28037.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28037.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=28037.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm31">Interface Design</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
