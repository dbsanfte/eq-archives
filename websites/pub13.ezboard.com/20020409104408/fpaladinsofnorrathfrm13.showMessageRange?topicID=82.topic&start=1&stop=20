I had him very close to dead on numerous occasions but he would just hide and heal up and backstab me if he got the chance. I believe if I had a see-invis item or bracer of the hidden I would have easily finished him, but as it was, the hiding made it very difficult.

Also when they landed he would go re-visible for a second, which is how I got him down as low as I did.<br><br>I eventually ran off into the mist and hills to med, hoping he would not see where I went (it worked the first time, hehe) and he followed me and finished me off.   <br><br>It was actually quite fun... however, I want to beat him next time.

The rogue *will* have to come to you eventually or there just isn't any progress to the duel and when he does pop out and hit you you can bash and then proceed to smack him around. Journeyman's walking stick + a shield works well in this position because if you get a tash proc off on him you'll be in a far better position to chainstun/flash of light etc. for max results. Epic or 2hand bash AAXP is prefered as well because you're gonna want to do as much damage in the little time the bash gives you before he slinks off again. Then it just becomes a timing game, a little Divine Purpose/Breath of Tunare, and a lot of patience. Though the whole method is just ghetto and you'd be far better off with see invis. The big question about duels that I'm still wondering though is wether or not DA or Sanctification will eat a manaburn.

The only catch to this is if the rogue is a very skilled duelist.  For fun one night I and a 60 rogue in my guild dueled and using jousting to my advantage I would run past him and smack him once or twice.  About the middle of the duel he countered this by using mouselook to immediately face my back as we were jousting so he ended up getting double backstabs on me sometimes.  I still won but it was an excellent counter-strategy.  Also if he/she will only fight you when in range then, like mentioned above, put your back into a corner so its much more difficult to get a backstab.  They can still try jumping up and behind you but if you stay close it won't work and all they'll get it cannot see target msg's.  The last thing I would mention is that if you see this rogue backing off to try to get the sneak on you use a bow and keep hitting them until they fight you again, using flame of light is pretty costly mana wise and that mana can save you.<br><br>Alphawolf Silverblood<br>Crusader of Clan Ta'Veren<br>Terris Thule <p>The way of the sword and the Way of Zen are identical, for they have the same purpose; that of killing the ego. - Yamada Jirokichi</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uduevalolivas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dueval Olivas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/27/02 12:31:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/tatooine/spielberg/81/sidepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: As long as we're talking duels,</span><hr size=1> As for if sanctification blocking manaburn the answer is:<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.cox.net/bginter4/duevalburned.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>NO!!!!<br><br>but DA will block manaburns and manaburn has a long enough cast time on it to bash as well.
