I can hardly believe this ceremony happened, I dont want to. It's like the kids were being treated like good little  pets, or toddlers who aren't capable of achieving anything on their own merits. What an incredible insult. I can hardly imagine a worse way to treat them. I wonder if any of the parents recognized the true nature of this and why it's so incredibly wrong. Some surely did.

<br>
How's this for another double standard: I, being a southerner and proud of my heritage have a big ole confederate flag on the wall of my bedroom.  I share the exact  same opinions about the matter as you folks do but would be considered racist 9 times out of 10 by the Politically Correct extremist wannabes.<br>
<br>
I'm not a racist. I'm proud of my heritage not some believer in oppressing folks.  Double Standards suck.<br>
<br>
As for the laws we have now, COME ON! That junk was long ago that the laws were created for. Sure women still don't make as much as men but it's far from being the discrimination of the past.  Perhaps it's not time for the laws to be repealed but perhaps they should be modified to better fit todays society.<br>

<br>
The problem is that a LOT of people who're still alive today remember those days. Its not been THAT long since the big civil rights movements and so all this stuff is still fresh in people's minds. For us folks who're in the 18-35 range we don't remember much, if anything, of really hardcore racism but those who're still representing affirmative action DO remember, or have close relatives who were treated like @#%$. <br>
<br>
This stuff needs time for another generation to pass before we can move on. You can't ask the Jews to forget and &quot;get over&quot; the holocaust anymore than you can expect blacks to just forget their civil rights battle and &quot;get over it&quot; just because the young generation hasn't had to deal with the real nasty stuff.<br>
<br>
Time is required, not an attack on political correctness. Afterall, the majority of attacks on PC things come from the younger generation, the ones who never had to live with the pre-civil rights movement lifestyle. We lack the perspective and hence consider it all bunk. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8400<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/02 11:28:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17273.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/portraits/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm in the minority on this subject....</span><hr size=1> &quot;Not like I dont put up with racist bull either.

<br>
One, you have an advantage being in the majority, would you like o change race if you could with one of them?<br>
<br>
Two, no, you shouldn't, you should oppose both sides of the racism, not accept both.<br>

<br>
But I agree with you on this. Seperate ceremonies seems bizarre and wrongheaded - I'd like to hear their side.<br>
<br>
Congrats to Errelno for sharing the point of view from his experience that most don't have.<br>
<br>
I think he's right that the white majority, while not actively racist, has a lack of understanding of the issues others face to quite an extent. Unfortunately, when there's an inequity that we'd all be better off having fixed such as worse schools and budgets for a minority school, the whites are largely utterly uninterested.<br>
<br>
The responsibility of citizenship in a democracy asks better than to not care about the fairness and benefit to the nation of not ignoring the issues like this. There is plenty of room for improvement and people should do the right thing.<br>
<br>
I'm going to list three political groups:<br>
<br>
1. The power grabbers who simply want the white support they can get by pandering to the people who want to hear the &quot;there's no problem, you don't need to spend money&quot; message.<br>
<br>
This group will say what it has to to keep the support - it'll be along the lines of minimizing/denying the problem, attacking the weaknesses of the other side (for example, quoting Al Sharpton a lot, talking about those who support the absurd &quot;reperations&quot;, etc.) They'll reassure whites that they are not bad people for opposing affirmative action, etc.<br>
<br>
All they're after, again, are the votes.<br>
<br>
2. The radical left on the race issue. These people may understand the problems somewhat, but too often not the reaosnable solutions; too often they have a &quot;more is better&quot; position on how to solve the problem.<br>
<br>
Want more anti-discrimination laws? YES! More affirmative action programs? YES! Extreme affirmative action programs? YES! Reparations? YES! These people properly get little public support, but are the default leaders of man of the disenfranchised for lack of alternative. Yes, they too often are 'reverse racists'.<br>
<br>
3. Those who try to understand the issues, analyze the causes, the problems, the options and see what makes sense.<br>
<br>
The problem is, in a democracy, 50% has the power, and group number 3 does not seem to be too close to 50%.<br>
<br>
So we happily go on with group 2 having legit issues and hating group 1, and its leaders contendedly maintaining that power base; and with group 1 happily ignoring the problems and cluck clucking at the excesses of group 2, as if that justified ignoring all the issues, and proudly opposing them.<br>
<br>
All bad politicians need are two groups to perpetually hate each other, and keep their own leaders in place who lead by opposing the other side. Of course, there's some irony in how dependant this makes them on the enemy, and how little incentive they have to solve the problem.<br>
<br>
Al Sharpton is far better off with David Duke in the news, than out. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/sig/jaharad.gif" border="0">
