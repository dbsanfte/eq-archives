I’ve played EQ on Rallos Zek since release.  I was there when no matter how you died, anyone could loot your corpse.  I was there for the now legendary gnome-elf war, and I was there for the raging battles between good and evil in Freeport and Qeynos.  I stuck around through the following years, playing a part in some interesting dynamic quests, getting pkilled and occasionally pkilling, and I watched as a guild fell apart due to a few dedicated pk’ers targeting us exclusively.  Shortly after that I left the game.  I just couldn’t keep giving money to a company that so steadfastly refuses to look into why pvp is so unviable as a fun way of playing the game, despite the fact that it has 4 servers full of people willing to play the flawed version of pvp, and despite the fact that the raging success of the team’s servers openings indicates that there is an even larger fan base willing to play a balanced (or at least fun) version of pvp.<br>
<br>
A few weeks ago I decided to come back to the game.  I had left a lot undone that I wanted to do, and I just missed playing the game and seeing my friends.  But now that I’m back, I’m not going to be silent anymore about the horrid state of pvp in Eq.  And so, this letter.<br>
<br>
I want to address what I see as the major deficiencies that prevent EQ from having a fun pvp system, and to suggest some remedies.  What I hope is that Verant will respond with an outline of what their plans are to make pvp more fun, and to address my propositions.<br>
<br>
CLASS BALANCE IN PVP<br>
Look, I understand that we can’t do much about this now.  This is a PvE game, and there will be no real changes to the classes.  BUT I still can’t talk about this without mentioning that this game is woeful in regards to pvp balance.  Now the traditional response is that grouping would solve this, and that may be so, in part, but there are still classes who get DD spells that inflict more damage than characters in another class would have as hit points in one to two casts!  Also, some classes have no way to escape from attack, and thus no way to save themselves, and in return for this loss of ability, they are given nothing in return.  A paladin who can’t gate, and can’t shadowstep/sow is a dead paladin if attacked by a caster.  Finally, pet classes are just so far out of balance that it is sick, and necromancers…well, shouldn’t have to say anything about them really.<br>
<br>
Still, nothing can really be done about class balance, at this point, in terms of dramatic changes, BUT there are a few ways to address the issues I’ve outlined above.  First, disproportionate damage outlays ratio.  You took a good step by implementing the pvp DD nerf, but more needs to be done.  Particularly, caster classes with fewer hp’s need better resistances to other caster class nukes and dots.  One shammy dot or one to two wizzy nukes can kill a mage or druid.  You have enough time to notice that you’ve been hit, stand up, hit a hotkey for a spell and die.  SO, I would advise you to look into rebalancing how offensive spells in pvp affect each class based on that classes unique features.  OR you could simplify it a bit by setting the max damage for each spell to be a percentage of HP’s of whatever target cast at.  Thus, Ice comet, which at 1120 damage would insta kill an unbuffed lvl 50 druid, could be set to take off at max 50% of a lvl 50 druid’s hp, with possibilities for resistances thrown in, and say 60% of a warriors hp, since warriors have higher hp’s and higher resists to help mitigate this damage.  I’m not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it is the only way I can see to balance a game where a few classes who can deal large amounts of damage from long distances can be kept in check relative to classes with either small amounts of hit points or no ability to traverse long distances quickly.<br>
<br>
Melee binding<br>
I know that you’ve said no to this a hundred times, despite the fact that 100% of your player base supports the idea, and despite the fact that the game would be more fun with it included.  You have your own ideas about why to keep this out, and we, respectfully, disagree about them.  BUT I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that every time a melee class is pkilled they are transported back to their bind point, and have to journey back to their corpse.  The risk v reward argument that you use to shut down melee binding pleas on blue servers, doesn’t apply to this case, because a group could be as careful as possible to keep the tank alive, and still have to suffer through the down time of waiting for the warrior to get back because they lost them to a wandering wizzie pk.<br>
<br>
Secondly, because most melee classes lack any kind of travel enhancement (sow, gate, etc), they almost never are able to re-engage the person who killed them.  Since it takes them so long to return to their body, the caster who killed them is long gone.  Also, if they were to catch up to said caster, the caster could gate or sow their way away.  If melee’s could bind, or had more places to bind in, these difficulties would reduce.<br>
<br>
Guard Pathing and Cities.<br>
IF it is an exploit for a group of players to use a mob’s pathing and the structural limits of a zone to engage in combat with said mob without fear of being attacked, then it is an exploit to utilize terrain and mob pathing issues to attack players who are sitting beside guards when the intent is to use the guard’s limited aggro radius and the silly issue of aggro (why does a guard aggro when a spell is cast, but not when one lands?  What sense does it make for me to get nuked beside the guard, and he’s fine with it, but if I cast back when I’m standing near him, he’ll attack?) to attack a player without any fear of repercussions.  For instance, say I’m in the bank in kelethin.  A wizzie comes up, targets me, and runs outside of the guard and banker’s aggro range.  Next, he nukes me.  Now I have two options, I can return fire (assuming I have him targeted) and then get attacked by the guard, or I can run for it.  Given the lag inside the bank, the need to click open the door, etc, running will get me killed, casting back will get me killed and cost me exp.  SO I bag, and die.  This is an exploit, and has been a known problem for years, and you’ve never done anything to address it.  And don’t get me started on the whole pet issue.<br>
<br>
Solutions: 1) increase guard aggro radius so that it is at least as long as a caster’s spell range, <br>
<br>
2) make guards aggro when someone near them is hit by a spell, arrow, or pet (This just makes too much sense for it to be implemented, I’m sure).  <br>
<br>
3) Turn off pvp within certain areas of zones, such as near banks, merchants, guilds (just an idea, not one I support, though it bears mentioning and is better than the current state of affairs), <br>
<br>
4) put faction hits for pvp back in, but do so with a) an aggressor flag so that defending oneself is possible, b) make faction hits dependent on who is being attacked so that the amount of faction lost is directly proportional to the amount that the character is liked by its home town (so that attacking a gnome necro wouldn’t cause too much faction loss by a good gnome warrior if the warrior wins, but attacking a high elf paladin who is lovingly looked upon by high elves would cause his attacker to be hated by elves), c) make faction hits zone dependent, not just race dependent.  So if you start a fight in gfay, you run the risk of taking a faction hit against elves, even if you are attacking a dwarf.  d) tie c) to b) so that you could still attack a dark elf in gfay without fear of taking a faction hit against elves, unless that dark elf was for some reason liked by the wood elves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Risk Vs Reward<br>
<br>
The big one, the big cahuna, the largest single issue on pvp servers.  The most ignored issue by Verant, the one you’ve never addressed, the answer we’ve never gotten, the solutions you’ve refused to implement.  Currently, there is no risk to pk’ing, and nothing but rewards from doing it.  I’m not talking about roleplayed pvp, where the roleplay is in and of itself (for me at least) worth the risk.  The best pvp I’ve ever engaged it was between me (playing a lvl 30 WE Ranger), a horde of little lvl 10-20 Elves, and about 3 lvl 25-35 Dark Elves in Crushbone.  The DE’s had taken up residence in the castle, and proceeded to attack me whenever possible.  I died, and kept dying, until I’d rallied the entire zone to come and heal me.  Minor healing spells were being cast all around me, lvl 10 rangers feeling like clerics, a few pallies dropped LH on me, and like 10 people were binding my wounds when I got low, and I managed to take out two of the DE’s.  In total I died about 5 times to them, got them just the two times, they looted my bread, my wine, and a BS mantle, and I got a leather mask and a pair of Splitpaw gloves (the old +2 dex ones).  The other times I died, they didn’t loot anything.  Thing is, I played this encounter in full gear because they sent me a tell saying they’d go easy on the loot, and that they just wanted to have fun, which we did.  After the battle, the SK and I played snare-darkness racing around the moat.  He won, cause he resisted the initial snare…<br>
<br>
Point is, that kind of pvp is rare.  Most often what you encounter is the lone naked caster with two good +INT items in their hands and one in the range slot running around zone lines looking to gank people, or hanging out outside of aggro range in a city like kelethin.  And what happens when they kill someone?  They loot and bag a valuable item, then they /auc it, and run around, free from any reprisals because they know that even if you kill them, you can’t loot back your item, and you can’t take anything from them.  There is no risk in their behavior.  Even reputation doesn’t bother them, because it isn’t worth anyone’s effort to try and kill them—they just respawn again and go off to get more loot.  And if they want to go on a raid, or group a bit, they logg in an alternate character and go and do that without anyone in the group being wiser.  Consistent with your actions in other matters in the game, when one aspect of the risk versus reward balance is thrown off, you must do something to repair the imbalance.  My suggestions follow:<br>
<br>
1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Implement a working faction system.  I gave some suggestions about faction above, so I won’t repeat them now.  Though I will say that this would not do enough alone to balance the risk v/s reward alone.  However, I would prefer it to nothing, and I do think that in a game so dependent on faction in terms of pve, it would make sense to have a functional pvp faction system in place.<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Coin only loot.  It bears mention that a large number of pvp players support coin only loot.  They feel that this would allow for freer and more frequent pvp encounters, greater ability to roleplay, less of a dependence on no-drop items, ability to compete with full-equipment and thus to compete on a more level playing field.  There would be other benefits to this change as well, and despite the vocal support of most players on Rallos Zek, and despite the runaway success that the change has had on the other Zek server, Verant keeps refusing to think deeply about this.  This one change alone would repair the whole darn issue.  You’ve created a game where characters are dependent on gear to compete and then allowed a loophole that risks destroying an entire server to stand.  This loophole both allows certain classes to compete without gear, as it forces other classes to be unable to compete for fear of loosing gear, which is needed to compete.  Make it coin only please.<br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Time limited item loot.  This is a nice idea about how to deal with loot rights.  Essentially, this is similar to coin only loot, except that once every two weeks you can be looted for one item.  I’m not wedded to the time frame, I could even see it being as little as one week, or as much as one month.  Point though is that you’ll get the time needed to re-equip yourself before you have to risk loosing another item.  Lets say you’re a lvl 50 druid wearing a shroud of nature, and you get pkilled.  They loot the shroud, and you head off to camp Droga.  15 hours later you have another shroud, but now you can pvp without fear of loosing that shroud for a few more days.  This would still allow the risk of item loss, but wouldn’t make it crippling, as it is now when you loose more than anyone could replace to pk’s.<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp No Drop pvp.  Make all items looted from other players no-drop, and make it impossible to loot items that you cannot wear.  This way we avoid having wizzie outfit his twink warrior in lvl 50 gear that he gets from pk’ing lvl 50 warriors.  I’m not so sure I like this, but it’s an improvement over the current system<br>
5)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lootable Containers.  Let us open containers when we kill someone in pvp, this way there would be no bagging, and we would have a chance of getting back an item that was taken to us.  This is not a very good idea, since it would still allow people to loot and bank items.  Perhaps there would be a way to make it so that items taken via pvp would be unable to be banked for a certain amount of time.  Combine that with lootable containers and the only way to keep an item pvp looted would be to camp out directly afterwards.<br>
6)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Experience Loss.  The one no brainer that probably won’t ever be allowed.  At first blush this might seem like a bad idea, one that would give pk’s an even greater weapon with which to inflict damage.  And it might be that after all, but it would at least allow some real way to punish a pk for their actions.  I’d like to see what would happen if someone pk’d a member of my guild if we could cause them exp loss.  We’d put them right back down four levels before the night was over.  I think that this would allow for a more equal risk than the current system, but it might be too much risk for the general player base to bear.  If so, then Verant still needs to address the imbalance in the risk v reward.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think that three things could be done to “fix” pvp in Everquest.  First, you must do something about the imbalance between the classes, and, no, making debuffs more powerful is the wrong way to go.  I think that taking a serious look at how a pvp rule-set for the spells functions in a pvp environment would be the first thing I’d do.  That way you could discover just how unbalanced spells that were designed for use against 6000+ hp mobs function in an environment where most characters have at the most 2000hp.  I don’t expect major revisions out of this review, but if you were serious about pvp balance, you should begin here.<br>
<br>
Granted, that the game is too late in its lifecycle to dramatically change pvp (unless you are, as I suspect, hoping to take a few more years out of the ol’ hoss) class balance.  Thus, I feel that you MUST do something to change the OUTRAGEOUS imbalance between risk and reward.  I think that you should implement melee binding.  I feel that you should do something to address guard pathing exploitation issues.  I think that you should implement a working faction system (see the one outlined above for an example of one that might work a bit better than the ill fated one tried a few years back).  I think, furthermore, that the single most critical change you should make is to either make all pvp coin only, or to allow for exp loss upon pvp deaths.  If you do not wish to make changes as dramatic as that, then I heartily recommend that you implement a time limited item loot as described above, so that pvp players do not have to constantly risk all of their best and most necessary items while the pk’s of the world risk nothing and gain everything.<br>

I like the melee binding 'idea', I think it is a good thing, just cause you already lose xp from a death (not PvP, but still) and then you also have to make 1 @#$!%$ corpse run!<br>
Maybe they did it, so you can not die, loot corpse and kill again? why not give warrior or tank same penalty then as casters? when killed in PVP, let then return with like 1 bub of life?<br>
<br>
and I happen to know why they didn't change guard agro range. simple: cause guards would be killing everything in the zone like those annoying rock guards in Nek forest <p>Wannawin Litlewolf, an animal loving druid <BR>
Walaf Weaponmaster, the mighty short pirate <BR>

Some good points.  It's true the pvp system is retarded.<br>
<br>
The de-buff thing... shows you how stupid verant is in regards to pvp.<br>
<br>
The guard agro thing..  Here is what I think should be done.  Guards SHOULDN'T help anyone.  I'm sick of seeing casters blaze away at melee's, and the melee's can't fight back for fear of guard agro.<br>
<br>
The PERSON who does 50%+ of the dmg gets to loot.  If you happen upon somebody fighting with 25% hps and you kill them, sorry no loot ganking little turd.  Yeah you'll actually have to fight.  Just like mobs, if you don't do 50% of the dmg no exp.<br>
<br>
Here is what I think should be done PvP wise to balance things out.<br>
<br>
DEBUFF NERF NEEDS TO GO, wtf was this anyhow, f'n verant dorks.  <br>
<br>
Warriors need to be given 1/3 again more hps,  and Rangers need to be given SOC.<br>
<br>
Rogues when sneaking/hiding SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SEEN !  They are hiding for gods sake behind some damn rock not standing in front of you with a spell on.<br>
<br>
Monks should have boosted FR and CR to reflect discipline and inner strength yada yada.<br>
<br>
SK's and paladins have LoH and HT, both very respectable in pvp.<br>
<br>
LINE OF SIGHT CASTING !  You can't cast on a bat you can't f'n see but you can cast on a paying customer you can't see and take his FBSS...  Another wtf was verant thinking.<br>
<br>
I personally think these would solve a ton of problems and would be the next best thing since the 1-5 no pvp thing.<br>

<br>
I wonder what upping melee class stats would do to unbalance the pve game, which is why I argued for a need to re-evaluate the power of spells in pvp.  That is, we'd achieve the same result--that wizzard casting Ice Comet would either hit for 800 points of the 4000 the warrior has, or hit for 500 of the 2500 (still 1/5 of total hps).<br>
<br>
agreed about rogues sneaking/hiding, but it should extend to all classes/races that can sneak and/or hide, so that those rangers can do it too.<br>
<br>
And about guard aggro, I agree that increasing the aggro radius would cause problems, but what about making guards attack the aggressor when the person being attacked is standing right beside them?  Think about it like this, you walk into a camp of mobs, they are all indifferent to you, so you back up and cast a nuke on one of them.  They all come out after you, because they notice their friend getting attacked, right?  NOw why doesn't this happend to that dumb guard next to me when someone is spanking me from across the street?  Silly guards, if another guard gets attacked their all like running after to kill the bad guy, but if I get attacked?  oh no, they'll just keep hanging out with their other guard buddies...guards that only guard guards are not very good guards, except at guarding other guards.<br>

But if they aren't gonna fix them, all they are in their current state is hindrances to people seeking retribution.<br>
<br>
I don't think the rogue sneak thing should extend to all classes.  Rogues ARE the best at hiding/sneaking type stuff and as such this should be unique to them.  SOC would make rangers true outdoor terrorists which they should be.<br>
<br>
The extra hp thing I don't think in any way would upset game balance pvp or pve.  ALL new kunark and velious mobs hit way hard than any tank 10-15 lvls higher than them anyhow.  Also 2-400 hps extra on a tank won't really reflect to much when mobs quad or triple for 100+'s anyhow.  Thats really only one extra round of combat.<br>
<br>
It would show in pvp though, as warriors would now be true beasts to take down.  That could mean 2 extra draughts or 2 extra scoraries, and would make it harder to kill warriors who are gimped pvp anyhow due to lack of options OTHER than hps.<br>
<br>
As far as the spell values go... I think they are pretty much ok as is.  I can stand toe to toe with an equal lvl wizard and heal pretty much np, granted thats about all I'm doing.  With proper resist gear also.  But WHY even spend 100 days of play time getting good resist gear anymore with the uber Fock up of the buff nerf?<br>
<br>
IF verant wanted to actually do things that would even the playing field on pvp servers, they would listen to people who actually pvp on them.  What I still find odd is the # of people who play on pvp servers but don't pvp hardly at all, but thats their choice.  I guess they just like the risk.<br>
<br>
What VI NEEDS to do is listen to people who ,,,<br>
<br>
a) Aren't whining that something needs to be done so they can GANK pk easier, this has NEVER EVER EVER been a hard thing to do in the first place.<br>
b) Listen to people who enjoy pvp solely for the thrill of combat and the challenge one gets from facing someone on equal ground.  Take their input and actually think about it.<br>
<br>
Again $.02 more cents for me,(might get up to a buck fifta on this topic)<br>

Melee's are already monsters in pvp when they get resists - as a druid main and a fraction off lvl 60 who players a lvl 60enchanter and sometimes a ranger,  there is no way in hell i can kill a melee of my lvl with half decent equipment unless he stands still and does nothing or decides to duel wield against my damage shield - and druids are arguably the most potent solo pvp casting class their is.<br>
<br>
This false belief that casters are over balanced is a complete load of twaddle, yes casters are going to kill an unequipped anyone who has 0 for resists, but as soon as you get MR so root/snare is no longer a worry, equip Jboots and get some pumice stones the fight very quickly turns in favour of melee's, all of a sudden you can't land snare/root, you can't land your dots and your being debuffed yourself - and this gear is available in the low sub 40 levels which is really just a few days playing time - in comparison to how long you will spend playing post 50 its relatively inconsequential...<br>
<br>
I've not even touched on fungul tunics/kunark(or velious) weaponary and the other uber pvp gear that destroys what little credibility casters had in pvp.<br>
<br>
As for grouping in pvp - Absor/Abashi was 100% correct - some classes aren't hugely impacting solo in pvp, nor should they be -( if you want a game where everyone is equal for its entirety, go play quake), the classes who are deemed as being the weaker classes in pvp(solo) are the most demanded class in pvp(so i guess it balances out some) - i.e. enchanters etc - however put them with a ranger who can snare/melee and you have a fearsome group - the tash and recant from the enchanter will strip a player of his MR and buffs very quickly which allows snares a chance of landing and once that happens you have another victim.<br>
<br>
PvP is all about MR and being able to out run your opponent (so he can't get away) - which is really why you need MR to avoid root/snare... unless your opponent is stupid or very unlucky, if he can run as fast as you - you'll never kill him (about the only exception here is a mage with his sow spell on his pet - but then zoning solves that problem, or a snare/root). <br>
<br>
The regen items available to all melee's and the regen spells available to rangers/bards are what make these classes great - when they get low on hp, they can simply disengage, run around for a few mins while they regen and re-enter the fight - of course a caster can't hope to regen mana anywhere nearly as quickly which is where the imbalance becomes very apparent. <br>
<br>
With resists so easy to come by, most casters will hardly ever achieve full damage from a nuke on a player, wizards have to rely on their lure type spells, which are heavily mana inefficient and very costly to use for a prolonged fight, any unresistable dot type spells are magic based and easily pummiced away - and when was the last time a clued pvp player had a resistable dot land ? ebolt is resistable with 50PR, alot of ppl sport double that.<br>
<br>
So in closing no, i think the last thing verant should do is bring more power to melee classes - they dominate the pve game, and to kill a knowledgable tank in 1on1 pvp as a caster is quite an achievement. In fact i'm an  advocate of either nerfing pvp melee damge to 2/3rds or bringing back full spell damage.<br>

<br>
1-  We play on ITEM loot server.  People don't wear fungi tunics and regen bp's pvp.  Its all about getting in the last hit to loot items.  It takes my warrior friend about 20 mins+ real time to regain hps, I can med back to full about 2 more times and dump mana into him at this rate.<br>
<br>
2-  I've never had a rogue/monk/warrior be able to disengage, even with jboots.  Sow is faster.<br>
<br>
3-  Its easy to wear down a melee hps when they can't hit you, because you can cast through walls etc...<br>
<br>
On a pvp server all classes should be able to have equal footing with others.  Why?  Thats why we play on pvp servers.  As a result of the unbalance, how many warriors do you think are on pvp servers as compared to druids/necro's/wiz's?  With my new -70fr debuff or whatever I hit alot for full dmg...<br>
<br>
Item loot is way different than non-item loot in terms of pvp.  RZ the gear classes risk everything, the non-gear classes risk nothing. <br>

A lot of the comments you stated are valid to a certain extent but for the high end only.  As in 55+.  Fungi's are still rare 55+.  As a caster, I've taken down many &lt; lvl 59 melees 1v1.    Sometimes without them even hitting me once in an outside zone.  I have gone 1v1 against Nanak and Splorge, arguably the 2 best PvP melees on the server.  I didn't kill them, nor really had much of chance but I did make a big dent in their HPs.  They are both 60 with epics and resists/experience up the ying yang.  I'm only 55 with no epic, and fair resists.  That's really the way it should be.  What would you think if someone a lot lower than you and a lot less equiptment was able to defeat you and your pretty experienced in PvP.  <br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter how fast they swing or how great their weapon is.  It's all about not getting hit as a caster.  The melee damage nerf would be nice as well as HT post 55 and BS.  1,000 hp BS is a bit much in PvP.<br>
<br>
Necro's, druids, mages to a certain extent and shamen are also excellent solo PKers.  Any melee is going to have a heck of time vs a good pet class.<br>
<br>
They up the debuffers which has helped a lot.  That extra 50% has made a difference in a lot of fights, esp with chanters.  <br>
<br>
Really pre-uber resist equiptment, casters OWN melees.  So bad it's really sad.  They need to impliment something where melee's at least have somewhat an ability to slow/hold their enemy or at least have an auto attack when following like pets can.  They should reduce the time on root in PvP and always have spells remove root.  They need to have resists capped at certain levels and powerful weapons, armor have a level minimun.  <br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, <br>
1) EQ is a PvE game. <br>
2) Casters own Melee's pre 51 (untwinked)<br>
3) It's gets more even around 53-57<br>
4) Melee's get the advantage when they start getting uber gear, resists, fungi tunics, epics<br>
5) A great deal has to do with how well a player plays their class.  I can name people in most classes that can own 95% of the people they meet, regardless of class.  60% of the people I PK uterlly suck at PvP, especially under lvl 51.  People who don't realize a DoT can be dispelled, ones that don't know what pumice is ect.<br>
<br>
Wizards are prob screwed the most but I've watched wizards solo PvP fairly well.<br>
<br>
All in all, they need to do something about melee vs caster at low level, nerf the melee damage by 33%.  <br>
<br>
For wizards, maybe have a % that the DD will do full damage no matter what their resists.<br>
<br>

<br>
IE... A draught still hits me for full dmg WHILE I have 180 fire resist.  Consequently, My nuke dropped on a wiz with comparable resist gear may do 100 pnts.<br>
<br>
Today I attacked 8pks... hehe  Yeah so they knew I was coming but there is nothing like a good bonzai charge I always say.<br>
<br>
The druids nuke hit me for 180, the wiz nukes hit me for 400, 380, 360, and another close to 400.  Amazingly I landed a winged death and a ro's before I was nuked into oblivion. hehe<br>
BUT !  As you can see the wiz's are still the ultimate nukers pvp.  /RUDE draught   My charred armor is an amazing example of this.  I don't see any need to increase a wiz's dmg output.<br>
<br>
The debuffers, as I've been saying, do not do anything pvp except further increase the unbalance melee vs caster.  A 60th lvl melee SHOULD be a beast to take down, he is 60th lvl with an epic for gods sake.  Verant shouldn't have to make it EASIER to pk melee's.  Plus what majority of the EQ pvp population is 60th lvl with maxed out gear?  A very small minority.  And in reality, you'll rarely fight these guys, they are to busy getting uber gear.<br>
<br>
So currently from your post kanwek... Melee's suck hind tit at pvp for 52 levels of a 60 level game.   I concur.<br>
<br>
Also EQ is a pve game, but there is no reason with a few simple fix's that verant could not level the playing field.<br>
<br>
Also one more thing.  How can you be for a melee dmg nerf?  With the game all a caster has to do is walk backwards and turn a couple times to avoid 80% of melee dmg.  What they need is a &quot;hit bubble&quot; where if your close the guy can hit you, wether or not your walking backwards or have lag etc...<br>
<br>
(Frail gnome wizard to newbie caster) &quot;Your best defense when fighting an 800 pound troll with a 150 pound cleaver is just simply to walk backwards in front of him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gimme a damn brake rofl.  You don't have to be a physics major to realize what should happen to a 30 pound wizard using this tactic...  <br>

<br>
1) 1 character per account - so no uber twinks killing you.<br>
<br>
2) EXP loss and coin loot for a kill within 5 levels of you.  Also a point system and some sort of item you loot and turn in for further rewards (sketchy on how this works)<br>
<br>
3) Guards are like on RZ, usually help those with better faction, but sometimes seems random<br>
<br>
4) Faction hits if you pk someone in or near their home zone<br>
<br>
5) teams based on religeon, this might not be to your liking coming from the free for all that is RZ.<br>
<br>
<br>
The exp loss gets rid of the casters bind rushing.  It also reduces the strength of bind, because bind camping is legal. So a caster needs to be very safe as to where he binds.  Tanks should bind near a guard they have good faction with.  <br>

I've seen the same monk, 56th then, take out a 60th warrior.<br>
<br>
I agree, no one in their right mind would ever wear a Fungi Tunic to pvp with on Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
I went to sullon zek... made an iksar monk... 106 people in the field of zone.  I went back to rallos where the item loot keeps the server population down at least.  Most of the folk who play evil classes on Sullon Zek are the same folk that play necro's on rallos (or started monks and rogues post kunark).  Damn near all the advantages.<br>

<br>
'but there are still classes who get DD spells that inflict more damage than characters in another class would have as hit points in one to two casts!'<br>
<br>
- only if these players have inadequate resist gear - your referring to ice comet and sunstrike, both are resistable with good CR/FR<br>
<br>
'Also, some classes have no way to escape from attack, and thus no way to save themselves, and in return for this loss of ability, they are given nothing in return. A paladin who can’t gate, and can’t shadowstep/sow is a dead paladin if attacked by a caster. '<br>
<br>
Again i disagree with this example, a paladin is one of the most pvp durable classes - i'm not saying he is great at killing people, but paladins are great at staying alive with their healing abilities. Given good resists, i believe that a paladin could defeat any int based caster in pvp.<br>
<br>
'Finally, pet classes are just so far out of balance that it is sick, and necromancers…well, shouldn’t have to say anything about them really.'<br>
<br>
Well here i have to disagree, i kill necromancers all the time and pets are easily nullified/removed with just a single spell, i'd not rate necromancers in the top 5 pvp classes - but i've had experience of them from lvl 1-60 and i'm not sure you have.<br>
<br>
'One shammy dot or one to two wizzy nukes can kill a mage or druid.'<br>
<br>
Only of a mage/druid has terrible resists - that certainly would never happen to me - even unbuffed i expect to resist any shaman dot and get good partial resists on mage type nukes.<br>
<br>
You give an example with ice coment doing 1120 damage. ice comet takes 6 seconds to cast - 6 seconds is forever in pvp, if you are sitting down and don't do anything until the ice comet lands you should be paying more attention. I'm always aware of who is in the zone with me, and when their is an enemy i'm very careful about where i meditate.<br>
<br>
Melee binding<br>
Sure give melee's binding, at the same time you give me 1500ac, 3000+ hp, duel wield and double attack with appropriate caps. Melee's become very overpowered in pvp at higher levels, they certainly don't need any more caster perks.<br>
<br>
Also paladins/clerics can both revive/ressurect which is why they are valuable in pvp groups.<br>
<br>
'Turn off pvp within certain areas of zones, such as near banks, merchants, guilds (just an idea, not one I support, though it bears mentioning and is better than the current state of affairs)'<br>
<br>
If you stupid enough to be withdrawing or banking when there are pvpers in the zone, you deserve to lose your coins.<br>
<br>
Your example of crushbone would be regarded on Vallon Zek as being highly dishonourable, there is a player made rule (as well now Verant enforced) that when you die in pvp, you are expected to return, loot your corpse and retreat to safety - the player populace supports that as being 1 hour where you leave the zone. Your example of returning to the pvp area 5 times would be considered highly discouragable, unless your opponents of course were not trying for zone control and in fact didn't mind.<br>
<br>
'Coin only loot'  - well i play on vallon where the server switched from item loot to coin only quite a while back. I prefer it this way, although my question is, if you prefer coin only loot why didn't you change servers over a year ago ?<br>
<br>
'experience loss' <br>
this exists on sullon zek, as does coin only loot.<br>
<br>
'and, no, making debuffs more powerful is the wrong way to go. ' <br>
<br>
I disagree, with the advent of powerful resist gear in velious and BD jewellery and the great weapons and benefits melee classes gained from the expansion, i think the added potency of debuffing helped to address the melee &gt;&gt;&gt; caster situation that was becoming very apparent and unfair.<br>

yes rallos will have a very different environment to vallon, but if it really upsets pvp so much their to the point your scared to wear your good items, you should be looking at going coin only loot rather than item.<br>
<br>
and yes put a good player vs a poor player, and regardless of class my money would be on the better player.<br>
<br>
overall, and considering EQ is a group based game i think the classes compliment each other very well in pvp<br>

I was 17th and got taken out by a wizzie and druid who (by their spells) were both 24+  Half the guild I was in were 30+  some people play EQ loads and on Sullon basically the people with most time to play will win...they get better gear and if a character is 10 lvls higher than you 1 vs 1 your are gonna die even if he is a Mage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I play a druid on Rallos and like Mance (I am in his guild) I like PvPing...I too have attacked 6 Pkers for fun knowing I couldn't possibly kill them all but had fun trying.<br>
Anyone who says that Melee class are at a disadvantage are right.....but only if the melee has invested totally in PvE gear I have a friend who has a Warrior 47 (twinkie) that has unbuffed FR/CR/MR all of 120+ what with his sow potions and nice weapons even outside I cannot take him down even being a few lvls higher.<br>
<br>
I think PvP can only really be on PvP servers as people expect it and gear for it....a duel on a blue server is not the same.<br>
Basically for duel PvP the EQ engine works.....but not for a PvP server.<br>
We can complain forever about it but sadly VI don't really care about PvP enough to care...proof of this was in the fact that they keep changing the SZ rules as they think things are unfair......they should let people deal with it not them.<br>
<br>
anyway PvP is the most fun part of EQ.....that is why I cannot wait for the games that are designed with PvP in mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I play a mid level monk on Rallos. Decent Resists are very hard to get untill after 50. Perhaps with lots of resist gear and no drop items I could stand to to toe against a caster but right now I get owned bad.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If you stupid enough to be withdrawing or banking when there are pvpers in the zone, you deserve to lose your coins&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Well personally I dont know the names of every pker on the server so I dont know if it is safe to bank untill I get pounded. Though I pesonally have not had much of a problem with pkers in banks. Except in thurg where there are allways pkers in the bank area there.<br>
<br>
About returning to fight being dishonorable it seems rather odd to me. I think returning for revenge is an integral part of Pvp.  Accually the most fun I have had pvping was when i was bound in thurg and fighting a group of pkers there. I didnt stand a chance in the 3 on 2 or even 3 on 1 battles i was having. But I just fought naked (one good thing about monks in pvp) and when I died I'd just charge back into battle. We all had fun (pkers included) and it also alowed people to safely bank while me and another were holding them back.<br>
<br>
My personal wish is to add a 51% loot code. I HATE gankers. I cant vount the number of times I was fighting a mob and get blasted when I'm low on health. I dont mind losing an item in a fair fight but to lose one to a single hit sucks.<br>

<br>
I'd also think pvp, for the most part, is very well balanced.  This game is so complicated, its impossible to define what "perfect balance" is.<br>
<br>
That said haha, I have two suggestions.<br>
<br>
1) Leave 66% (62.5?)  DD and DoT nerf (haha some dots arent even nerfed).  Ice comet is nerfed, please don't say Wizards can nuke for 1120 with IC because you are wrong.<br>
<br>
2) After lvl55ish, raise INT caster softcap (especially Necro, Mage, Wizard) to 255.  <br>
<br>
I'd suggest leaving WIS caster softcap at 200, please forgive me for saying so on this holy ground.  Winged death, for example, in a exp group in say Sebilis where mobs last the dot's duration is much more manaefficient than almost any wizard spell, assuming all wizard spells hit for full, which lol, they do not.  And WIS casters have the added benifit of healing melee classes, which as we all know are the kings of PvE in the 50s.<br>
