<br>
Under 'Magic changes in Test server' I read once you duck your spell gets interrupted immediately. Is this true? Can this be true? please say yes!!!! many of my friends have died after I accidentally clicked on the complete heal spell... Say this is true and will go live please!!! <br>
<br>
<br>
- This is true on Test at the moment. Whether or not is will remain that way until we patch next is uncertain. Right now, the plan is to leave it this way, but that plan could change so don't get too excited. <br>
<br>
The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. We are fully aware of the beneficial side of this change, and as of our last meeting we are inclined to keep that beneficial side as it is. <br>

Alan, there's a discussion at necro.eqclasses.com in regards to the use of essence emeralds (primarily about why they aren't used and what could be done to fix them). It would certainly honor us necromancers if you would take a look or reply to the email that Qque sent you. I would also like to add to what Qque said in that instead of making a new item (Emeralds w/ charges) you could ask Lawrence to see if it's feasible to make sacrifice create multiple gems while still requiring the original emerald reagent. This would certainly make casting spells like sacrifice more palatable and, while it won't compete with clerics, it will make necromancers a little less sketchy about casting other spells. I for one, would never use Trucidation or Infusion with the current requirement, especially since Infusion is not targetable. <br>
Also, if you would, ask Lawrence why I can't cast Manaskin and/or Shield of the Magi (both self-only spells) if I have a lower-level character targetted (one whom I would be unable to buff with a 50+ spell, assuming that I had any 50+ buffs). There's a message displayed stating that the target is too low level for me to cast my self-buff. Thanks in advance. <br>
<br>
-- We've already discussed Essence Emeralds, actually. We don't have any plans to change the way they work or the spells that use them. We want those spells to be rarely used and difficult to gather components for. We want them to be cast rarely and with good reason. We think the spells and the Essence Emeralds are right where we want them. <br>
<br>
There is a bug that I'm aware of on Sullon that we are working on that is similar to what you describe, but I wasn't aware of it on any Live servers. I'll mention it to the folks working on the fix for Sullon and see if they can expand it to the Live servers. <br>
<br>
Thanks <br>
<br>
Alan <br>

OK mages get monster summon because they are the masters of summoning. Enchanters are masters of illusion why dont they get monster illusion? It would be the same as monster summons except they become the monster , being choosen randomly. Something that would even out the illusion would make gaurds or other protecting NPC attack you while in monster illusion (I.E. you turn into a rat in FP and go next to a gaurd the gaurd will attack you) And there could be different kinds of monster ones as Minor monster illusion , monster illusion, and major monster illusion. Minor: rats, orc pawns and other small monsters. Regular monster illusion would be orcs , dervs, and others. Major would be giants, griffans, and so on. BTW what about a sex change illusion just for fun. <br>
I remember covering this once, but that might have been on the old boards. <br>
<br>
-- The reason for not allowing this is, primarily, about faction and body type. Turning into a minotaur, for example, would allow you freedom to explore a lot of places without fear of attack by other minotaurs. Turn into a goblin and goblins will be likely to give you too much freedom in their homes. <br>
<br>
This isn't so much of a problem with pets, because the master of the pet isn't masked by the pet, even though the pet might have some added freedom of movement. <br>
<br>
Alan <br>
<br>
I just have one concern. Will the NPC's be getting the anti-gate spells? <br>
<br>
-No, NPCs will not be getting this spell (and not so much because we don't want them to, but more for technical reasons). And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP either, for the same technical reasons. <br>
<br>
Because of the fact that the spell would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to discuss whether or not we want it to work on player characters… I think it would be fun, but that's just me. <br>
<br>

My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that drops in .<br>
If you put these gloves on Hight Elf or Gnome they are awesome looking. The colour is bright, even neon red. The best looking gloves in the game.<br>
I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when I put them on. They have a reddish, dark brown colour when they are on Dark Elf hands.<br>
<br>
Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them to look on Dark Elf the same as they look on High Elf? Is this a bug or just a bad feature because of some shading in graphics or such? I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have been exellent for my look. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these gloves look like they should on Dark Elves? <br>
<br>
You know the saying: &quot;Style before everything.&quot; <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there. <br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>

The answer is a little complicated. <br>
<br>
Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces. When tinting a piece of armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with it, sorta). So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform for each race that wears it. This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to the armors that we create. But it also means that there is no way to get a uniform look across all the races.<br>

<br>
More so.  As I watch Alan, I come to appreciate Gordon more each day.  What it shows is that Gordon actually understands the game very, very well.  He doesn't have a perfect understanding of everything, but he really does understand it.  Gordon's big problem is that he has the tact and delivery of a Vogon Poet Laureate and suffers from foot-in-mouth disease.<br>
<br>
But watching Alan Vancouvering, I found myself terribly frightened that they would let this moron into tuning meetings.  He may be diplomatic and reasonably well spoken, but that doesn't mean he has a clue about the game.<br>
<br>
The recent example has to do with &quot;his way&quot; of playing.  He's said in the past that &quot;if you don't want do play something because it's not roleplaying, don't use that feature&quot; and yet just the other day he said that he's not in favor of the ability to automatically run upon log in.  He tries to have it both ways.<br>
<br>
But the biggest clue that he doesn't have a clue himself was the &quot;Class Talks&quot;.  How many of them did he preface with &quot;I don't know much about this class&quot; only to spend message after message making ludicrous statements about what was wrong with each class.  He would pontificate about things he knew nothing about and he would change his position many times on the same issue from class-to-class.  <br>
<br>
Alan Vancouvering may be a heck of a nice guy he needs to stop trying to think for himself because it only reveals himself to be an idiot.  The one that most recently got me is the Essence Emerald question.  It sucks to be a high level necro, more than any other class, IMHO.  It's like they say &quot;Necromancers are sucking as intended.&quot;  Every time he says, &quot;I don't like&quot; or &quot;I think that&quot; I want to smack him.  And I want to slap the @#%$ out of him every time he says, &quot;we made it this way because...&quot; like HE actually had anything to do with it.  He may represent the company, but he signs his posts with his own name too.  I just wish someone would break it to him that he's a glorified message boy that passes things from the people who have a clue to the players and vice versa. <p><i>Lisset Beggarsbane<br>
