Or as the man replied when asked why he climbed a mountain, &quot;because it's there&quot;.<br>
<br>
So a few months ago, I decided to see if I could get my Brell-worshipping Dwarf Paladin to gain enough Cabilis faction standing to be able to bank there.  So as not to keep you in suspense as to the outcome:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/cabilis/bank.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The story of how I did it follows.<br>
<br>
There are six faction groups in Cabilis:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
LegionOfCabilis:       Warrior guild (including Troopers and Warlords)
CrusadersOfGreenmist:  Shadowknight guild (including most Crusaders)
ScaledMystics:         Shaman guild
BroodOfKotiz:          Necromancer guild
Swifttails:            Monk guild
CabilisResidents:      Bankers, most vendors, miscellaneous NPCs
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
The faction group necessary for banking/vending privileges is the CabilisResidents faction.  However, the catch is that all the ways to increase CabilisResidents faction standing require dealing with the Iksars who are on the LegionOfCabilis faction.  So they're the first that you'll need to work on.<br>
<br>
To increase your faction standing with LegionOfCabilis, kill Sarnaks and/or Goblins and/or &quot;outcast&quot; Iksar (bandits, footpads, pariahs, etc.) around Kunark.  Lots and lots and lots (did I mention lots?) of them.<br>
<br>
I had to kill 1,314 Sarnak+Iksar+Goblins (mostly Goblins) before the Troopers finally /conned &quot;Glaring&quot; to me, and a total of 1,562 before I was finally &quot;Dubious&quot; (and thus non-KoS) to the Troopers.  This sounds like a lot (and it is), but it took me only about a week of dedicated &quot;kill it if it gives faction&quot; to reach that point.  And anyone who has made a career of leveling in Kunark (I hadn't) may already have killed that many.<br>
<br>
There is every indication that the level of the Goblin/Sarnak/Iksar makes no difference to the amount of faction gain (all give 1 point of increase).  So the newbie goblin hills to the west of the Cabilis entrance in Warslik's Woods is a good place to commit mass Goblin genocide.  If you're of sufficient level, the Goblin fort in northern WW is great too, I got a lot of faction increases while clearing and reclearing the Fort hoping to get a Totem of the Warrior Spirit from Grachnist the Destroyer (and I succeeded).<br>
<br>
At this point, it was time to move to Field of Bone.  At the Cabilis gate in FoB, you'll find Trooper Mozo.  For four Bone Chips, he'll give you one point of faction increase with five different groups:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
   Your faction standing with LegionOfCabilis got better.
   Your faction standing with CabilisResidents got better.
   Your faction standing with ScaledMystics got better.
   Your faction standing with CrusadersOfGreenmist got better.
   Your faction standing with Swifttails got better.
   You gain experience!!
   You receive 2 silver from Trooper Mozo.
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
This covers every faction group in Cabilis EXCEPT the Necromancers, and you don't really need them for anything.<br>
<br>
From here on out there are only two impediments to increasing Cabilis faction.<br>
<br>
The first problem is reaching Trooper Mozo without getting creamed by the roaming Crusaders, who you will still be very KoS to.  There are two of them in the FoB around the Cabilis entrance:  Crusader Bodli, and Crusader Quarg.  Interestingly, although almost every Crusader in and around Cabilis are on the SK faction group (CrusadersOfGreenmist), including Bodli, for some reason Crusader Quarg happens to be on the Shaman faction group (ScaledMystics).  In order to avoid getting stomped by the Crusaders, I very strongly recommend starting an Iksar newbie as a &quot;spy&quot;, and using it to follow the two Crusaders around until you become familiar with the pattern of their rounds.  This makes it MUCH easier to avoid their patrols.  Here's a map of the FoB are around Cabilis:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/cabilis/fob.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The red line shows the path you should take sneaking up to the gate -- stay high on the hills surrounding the city &quot;pavement&quot; until you make your last dash up to the gate.  The yellow line shows Crusader Bodli's patrol path.  Note that as he comes out of the city gate, he makes a left, walking right along the path you need to follow to approach the gate, so look sharp and don't run into him head-on.  The blue line shows Crusader Quarg's patrol path,  you shouldn't run into him if you follow the red line into, and then back out of, the city area.  Note:  Once you reach Trooper Mozo, if you stand close as possible to the &quot;torch&quot; without being out of &quot;Trade&quot; range with Trooper Mozo, you will be (barely) far enough from the Crusaders as they march into and out of the city gate to avoid aggro.  But it takes nerves of steel to stand there as they walk that close by you.<br>
<br>
The second impediment to good Cabilis faction is having the dedication required to gather the MASSIVE number of Bone Chips necessary to bring your remaining Cabilis faction standings up to a usable level (Apprehensive or better to the bankers/merchants, and non-KoS to most everyone else).  To reach the point where I could bank, I had to turn in 7,596 Bone Chips (1,899 quest completions).  That is not a typo.<br>
<br>
The good news is that the best source of Bone Chips in all of Norrath is right there in Field of Bone:  Kurn's Tower.  It's full of skeletons in the 10-18 range, and they almost always drop Bone Chips (up to 3 at once some times).  Even the Burynai in the basement often drop Bone Chips.  Plus, there are a lot of lowbie Iksars hunting there, and they are frequently glad to sell the stacks of bone chips that they have acquired.<br>
<br>
I lived in Kurn's Tower for a full week and a half before I had gathered enough Bone Chips to be able to walk the streets of Cabilis.  Here are some highlights from my visit:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/cabilis/bones2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/cabilis/bones.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
(Don't worry, the skeletons in Kurn's don't actually aggro in such huge numbers, unless you get impatient like me and run everywhere on the floor annoying them all before training them to one spot to be finished off at once.)<br>
<br>
And just for the heck of it, here are a couple of nice snapshots of Divine Might in action against a Kurn's skeleton (taken a few seconds apart):<br>
<br>

<br>
For purposes of analysis and reference, I keep EVERY log of EVERY Everquest session I've ever had (starting at level 9, all the way up to my current level 51).  So it made a really handy archive of information when I wanted to go back and see exactly how many kills or quests it has taken me to reach the various stages of Cabilis faction.  I wrote a quick little program to scan my logs and extract the following table:<br>

</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
How to read this table:  Each line represents a stage in my trek towards better faction.  They are arranged chronologically, from earliest to most recent.  Each line contains a /con reading for a particular Cabilis faction group (Troop=LegionOfCabilis, Klok=CabilisResidents(bankers/vendors), Crus=CrusadersOfGreenmist, Monk=Monk's guild).  I did not include the Shamans (ScaledMystics) because they were &quot;Scowling&quot; KoS to me from start to finish -- more on that later.<br>
<br>
On each line, along with the /con reading, I show the grand total number of faction-giving Sarnaks, outcast Iksars, and Goblins that I had killed to date (&quot;Sar/Iks/Gob&quot;), and the total number of Bone Chip quest completions (&quot;Bon&quot;) (please note that this is the number of completions -- multiply by four to get the actual number of Bone Chips required).<br>
<br>
The &quot;****&quot; line breaks indicate points where one or more of the faction standings had changed category (e.g., from &quot;Apprehensive&quot; to &quot;Indifferent&quot;).<br>
<br>
The first thing that's interesting to note is that this table verifies the long-standing bit of EQ  lore about your faction standing maxing out with a given group after +2000 faction increases above your &quot;base&quot; (original) faction.  Sure enough, after 2000 kills/quests which increased my Trooper (LegionOfCabilis) standing, I was at &quot;Indifferent&quot; standing with them, then STAYED there at &quot;Indifferent&quot; despite doing 1,932 further faction increases with them (which without a faction cap would have been enough to easily bring me not only to &quot;Allied&quot; status, but to &quot;Allied and wants to have your child&quot; status).<br>
<br>
Second, it had long been the case (and well known) that maxing a &quot;primary&quot; faction on a faction quest would prevent all the &quot;associated&quot; factions from increasing any further.  HOWEVER, the 11/29/00 EQ patch changed that.  From the patch message:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
   PATCH DAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2000<br>
<br>
   Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop<br>
   gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary<br>
   faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now<br>
   be able to further modify associate factions in the<br>
   appropriate direction.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Note that my &quot;quest log&quot; verifies that this is indeed the case -- I maxed Trooper faction early, and yet despite the fact that Trooper faction was the primary faction on the Bone Chip quest, I nonetheless managed to eventually raise the other four factions -- they did not &quot;stall&quot; just because the Trooper faction was maxed.  So, I can not stress strongly enough, IGNORE faction quest guides that were written before the 11/29/00 patch if they give you advice which concerns itself with maxed factions.  I have run across dozens of such guides, as well as many people in the game who STILL are not aware of the 11/29/00 patch change and its liberating effect on faction quests.<br>
<br>
Another item of interest is that when I had finally maxed ALL the Cabilis factions which could be increased by the Bone Chip quest (i.e., I had completed more than 2000 Bone Chip quests, guaranteeing that the faction standings would be as high as I could ever get them), I was comfortably &quot;Indifferent&quot; to the Troopers, Vendors, Crusaders, and Monks, but still deathly KoS to the Shamans.  I'm not sure why, but it's probably a clash of religions.  Odd, though, that the SK's religion doesn't prevent them from being friendly with me, and you'd think that they'd be more anti-Paladin than the Shamans.  Oh well.  The good news is that they're easily avoided, and I don't need them for anything.<br>
<br>
Also please note that my final faction standings depended on wherever I happened to be after +2000 faction raises over my &quot;base&quot; standings with those faction groups.  The reason that this is important is that at least in theory, every class/race/religion combination can have a different &quot;base&quot; faction standing with every faction group in the game.  Thus, while the above would be sure to work for any other Brell-worshipping Dwarf Paladin like me (because we'd all have identical &quot;base&quot; faction standings), I can not guarantee that, for example, a Marr-worshipping Human Paladin might get the same results.  For all I know, the Iksar may be more hateful of Marr than they are of Brell (or Humans compared to Paladins).  On the other hand, I can't see any reason to presume that other (non-Iksar) races would be any more hated by the Iksar than any other, nor that any of our goody-goody Paladin gods wouldn't be on an equal(ly bad) original footing with the Iksars.<br>
<br>
Yet another item to remember which is obvious from looking at the chart:  No matter how KoS your actual faction standing might be with them, VENDORS NEVER CON LOWER THAN DUBIOUS, nor do they ever attack you (unless you hit them first).  I think this is probably Verant's way of making sure that commerce is not interrupted every time a KoS person runs by a shop (and saves the GM's lots of /petitions about a vendor being out of place and refusing to sell, and/or gone because the vendor attacked a high-level KoS person and the person killed the vendor in self-defense).  Also, this is a life-saver, since there are a few shaman-factioned and necro-factioned vendors mixed in among the &quot;regular&quot; vendors.  Without this safeguard, they'd make it hard for you to reach the other vendors without causing a train.  The downside, however, is that it makes it very hard to tell how close (or far) you are from &quot;able to buy/sell&quot; status, since a vendor will be &quot;dubious&quot; to you all the way up until the time it FINALLY rolls over to &quot;apprehensive&quot; and you can then buy/sell.<br>
<br>
Also, I did nothing to try to increase my Necromancer standing, so along with avoiding the shamans, I have to remember to avoid the necros.  I'm still KoS to both.  I'm forever KoS to the shamans (maxed and still KoS, that is), although I might POSSIBLY be able to get friendly with the necros if I killed enough outcast Iksar to max my BroodOfKotiz faction -- but there's little reason to bother, and even maxed I might have the clash-of-religions-so-still-KoS problem I have with the Shamans.<br>
<br>
So it's important to know where the shaman/necro NPCs are if you follow in my footsteps.  Here's a map of the north half of East Cabilis (&quot;borrowed&quot; from the magnificent <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">www.eqatlas.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> site):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/cabilis/ecabilis.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The top red circle is the shaman's guild.  Try not to walk into it if you ever want to walk back out again.  You CAN safely walk along the edge of the &quot;pool&quot; in front of the shaman's guild, that gives you a safe distance.  However, you'd quickly run into the blue dot, which is sometimes (not always, but you never can tell when) occupied by a necro-related NPC named &quot;Grype&quot; who will come boiling out of the hut after you, triggering all the Crusaders and Guards to attack you as well.  Likewise, there are two shaman-related NPCs in the building marked by the other red circle, the &quot;Furscale&quot; brothers, who will likewise run out of their house and attack you no matter which direction you try to sneak past their abode.<br>
<br>
So the easiest way into and out of East Cabilis from Field of Bone is to follow the green line I have marked -- just dive into the &quot;pool&quot; from its northeast corner, then swim to anywhere in town you want to go, or climb out of the pool once you've passed the three trouble spots I marked.  The entire rest of East Cabilis will be perfectly safe once you're non-KoS to the other four faction groups in town.<br>
<br>
Ah, but how to get back out?  Climbing out of the pool via any of the ladders leaves you south of the 3 trouble spots, and there's no way to walk back to FoB around them.  That's where a little trick comes in.  With a decent swimming skill, you can leap out of the pool like Flipper even without a ladder.  Just swim up to near the edge, &quot;aim&quot; almost straight up, then keep swimming &quot;forward&quot;.  You'll hop up and down a few times, scraping the side of the pool, but will eventually jump out onto the pavement.  Do it where the green line meets the &quot;pool&quot; and you'll be safely away from the Furscales and the shaman's guild, ready to wander back out to FoB -- but you'll always have to dodge Crusader Quarg out in FoB, since he's shaman-related and will always hate you.  But his patrols are easy to anticipate.  Also, it's good to know that even if he's hanging around inside the gate as he tends to do on his rounds, you will NOT be in aggro range of him as you zone out of E.Cabilis and  into the FoB gate.  You'll be close enough to get the cold sweats, but he'll be safely out of range.  Just wait for him to wander off, then beat feet out of the gate.<br>
<br>
You can also wander into West Cabilis, the home of the necros, as long as you keep a safe distance from the big, impossible-to-miss necro guild tower.  No other NPCs outside of the guild house will aggro on you (however the necro-related vendors on the &quot;ice&quot; will refuse to deal with you).  The only other KoS NPC in W.Cab is the &quot;Hermit&quot;, marked as #10 on the eqatlas.com map of W.Cab.  But I did some test runs past his alcove, and he never aggroed (although he *IS* KoS), so it seems that he's far enough off the path not to be a problem.<br>
<br>
If you ever want to do some &quot;/con recon&quot;, here's a handy way to do it -- enlist the aid of a non-KoS accomplice (Iksar, most likely) who will go into buildings, or other places you can't see into from a distance, and target an NPC you need to /con.  Now have them run back next to you (without clearing their target), then you do an /assist on your helper (this won't work unless they are close to you).  Now, you have their target as your own target (don't forget to turn OFF autofight if your default is to engage autofight when /assisting).  You can now press &quot;c&quot; to do a /consider and learn whether you're KoS to that NPC or not.  Repeat until you've scoped out every hard-to-target NPC in the area.<br>
<br>
Finally, try not to die in Cabilis.  Needless to say, there's a distinct lack of Clerics in there, nor are any Clerics likely to be terribly enthusiastic about sneaking into town (all Clerics in the game will be KoS in Cabilis unless they do the same amount of faction work I've done).  However, it is possible to smuggle a Cleric in with invis potions; neither the Troopers nor Crusaders see through invisibility.<br>
<br>
It was a lot of work to become able to walk the streets of Cabilis and buy/sell/bank, but it was worth it.  Not only does it make my Kunark travels much easier now (shortcuts through Cabilis are handy, and Cabilis is a more convenient place to bank from many zones than FV) but as they say in the Mastercard commercials:  &quot;Having an Iksar come up to you in Cabilis and blurt out, 'Holy sh*t, how in the hell did YOU get in here??' -- priceless&quot;.<br>

Thank you!  I had wondered if it was possible for a Paladin to do this.  It has also given me insight about doing this from the &quot;other side&quot;.  I guess it should have been obvious, but after almost two years, I didn't know that merchants were always dubious!  I guess all the bankers are as well?<br>
<br>
My Iksar Monk has more hope than I thought.  Monks, etc. can sneak up behind merchants (and be indiff) to buy and sell, but if they make a small mistake they won't be floored by the merchant.
