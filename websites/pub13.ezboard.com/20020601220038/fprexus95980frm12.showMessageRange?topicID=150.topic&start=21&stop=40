Have to have your ?pearl? to get on the list, period. The list was started by sign up originally. But, in Prexus' case, I would use:<br>
<br>
1) you have to have your pearl to turn in to get on list<br>
2) highest lvls get top spots on list<br>

Check Luclin for how it's set up. I know some people don't like it, but it seems fair to all and seems to be running fairly smoothly now.<br>

<br>
i thought this topic was a pro or con DISCUSSION...<br>
<br>
discuss why this wont happen.. or couldnt... or whatever you have on your mind..<br>
<br>
no i myself dont think this will ever happen... allow me to discuss why though...<br>
<br>
because this has to do with 1 class..  not a guild..<br>
<br>
if it was a plane..  or dragon..  that guilds would want to take down.. then you bet there would be a rotation..  but this mob is only valuable to 1 class in the game.. so unless this class forms a cleric union... to demand better epic encounter conditions..(lol) they are stuck with a bs camp..<br>
<br>
but again as this is a discussion...  in order to make a LIST.. that is fair for everyone..  well lets be honest.. we are not going to please everyone.. as we already know..  but we can try to please as many as we can..<br>
<br>
in a list..  we do not want to make this epic harder then it already is...<br>
<br>
thats why i posted my opinion on how a list should be.. feel free to pick it apart, give me reasons on why it wouldnt.. but dont just say it it wont happen..  i already know that.. and the main reason why, i already stated...<br>
<br>
I play a paly..   i havnt even gotten my soulfire yet..  hehe all thats left is to kill lucan... i already have all the dusty bone stuff for my 49 level spell..  but there is alot of stuff that i will not be able to accomplish due to rotations, merit, nor being in a uber guild and so on...  <br>
<br>
will i get this stuff.. maybe..  but with rotations, i at least have a chance,<br>
<br>
the reason i would have a chance is because other things drop off these mobs that are of use to other classes..<br>
<br>
 where as without rotations.. then 1 maybe 2 guilds would monopolize the spawns or planes and noone would have a chance...<br>
<br>
I am not saying a list is warrented in this case.. hell i am not even a cleric..  and know nothing about what it takes or pretend to know what it takes to do this epic..<br>
<br>
i am just offering a suggestion..   or a pro discussion..<br>
<br>
if you have a con discussion i would be glad to hear it... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umorkenlar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morkenlar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/10/01 11:08:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zordak Ragefire on Rotation?

There won't be a list because:<br>
1.  there is no fair way to start one.<br>
2.  There would be no way to convince all clerics to abide by it.<br>
3.  There would be no way to manage it, as the item needed is no drop and can't be verified.<br>
4.  A list would be unfair to those willing and able to camp Zordak.<br>

so say...  Guild A and Guild B  were to be present at the next downing of Zordak, if guild A did not take down Ragefire in 2 hrs then it's fair for Guild B to take him down..<br>
<br>
then it really doesn't matter if guild A has a pearl or not, non?<br>
<br>
shrug  seems relatively fair to me..<br>
<br>
if there is a problem, much like there are in planes, etc.. then the guild loses their right to the rotation... shrug<br>

<br>
and you all say this mob is for the cleric epic, yes.. but am I wrong  but I could have sworn that Zordak also has Naggy's loot table<br>

But that just opens up all the same old prejudices that everybody loves to point out.  Small guilds, Large guilds, independants, Rules for getting on the list, etc...<br>

Leave it the way it is my opionion.  You will never find a way to make a working list that will make the majority of the server happy I don't think.  Though I honestly hope you could just to stop this never ending topic.<br>

<br>
The more I think about it, I was extremely lucky to have the required time/components when I did.  Not everyone can take 3 days off of life (and I hear clerics are camping the cleric thats camping zordak now, so possibly 7 days, if not more with a naggy spawn int here).  Thats not epic, thats depressing.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt a list would ever happen, but a fair (imo) way to do it, would be by level, then an open random.<br>
<br>
Sure, level is not always the fair way, but it seems fair to me.  I know there is a whole lot of 58-60 clerics without an epic, with the pearl, that simply dont have the necessary time to plant their bottom in naggy's lair for a few days.<br>
<br>
This creates a problem, because its rumored that keeping fg's clear increases ragefire's spawn rate.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a fair way, would make some sort of requirment to keep fg's down half of the time, 2 spawns, and just hope for a quick spawn.  A 4 hour requirement is silly, if he spawns at 4 a.m. You're pretty much out of luck like that.  Mine spawned at about 2:30 a.m. EST, and luckily I had a lot of friends come.<br>
<br>
I hate posting here, because I'll undoubtedly offend atleast one person by anything I could possibly say.  A list is the great equalizer, but, unfortunately things are not always equal in everquest.  As much as I support the &quot;idea&quot;, I know I would feel differently if I was the one forced to wait months for something I wanted to earn now.<br>
<br>
If it were to be done... I'd say a level 60 random, then a 59 random, on down the line to 56 (minimum level).  Why 56?  The list will be huge already, and plus.. I don't agree with a level 52ish charachter having one, just my opinion.  If you can't cast it, you shouldn't be able to click it. (Again, my opinion).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I seriously doubt if that ever happens, but it really would be a great day.  One major problem, is level's change fast, 59's stay 59 a while, but you can get a level every few days if you work pretty hard 56-59.  One thing we definately need to get rid of, is clerics camping the cleric thats camping ragefire.  When ragefire dies, clerics throw up a random to see who gets, all of this camping after clericx camps him really holds a lot of favoritism.<br>
<br>
Also, most people are adults who play this game, and understand that &quot;real life&quot; is.. real.. hehe.  This is a game, and when it comes down to weilding a ball and chain, or having something for dinner, I think we all know which we should choose.<br>
<br>
My thoughts are scattered, and this is a horribly organized post, although, it's simply a collection of my opinions.  The great thing about opinions, is that we are all entitled to them, and they are all correct, to the one who feels that way.<br>
<br>
Had I started playing on prexus 6 months later than I had, I would not have an epic weapon.  I guess its kinda like a gm event, just have to be in the right place, at the right time.<br>
<br>
<br>
ps:  Maybe a better thing to do (Like the trouble I stirred up 4 or 5 months ago) would be to set some regulations on the camp.  Cleric has to be in the zone, with some leadway (fg's are spawning, I had to gate out a few times and wait for people), atleast have someone not afk most of the time calling the camp, even if its not the cleric, people do use telephones sometimes.  I really don't think its bad for the cleric to sleep sometimes.  The game is built around friendships, and this is great way to make them stronger.  I remember when sneer camped ragefire on his necro, the necro had FD.  Thats fine, he wasn't afk all the time.  If the cleric had a monk, etc...  I think the main point is to have someone awake, at the keyboard, the majority of the time.  (Lots of times I would call campcheck for 45 minutes, get no response, clear fg's and find a monk fd'd there with an afk message about how zordak was camped.  When they finally came back a few hours later, I was harassed for sitting there, etc) <p><img src="http://w3.one.net/~m1100/eannesig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uancasterstillwaters.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ancaster Stillwaters</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/21/01 6:52:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://eliteprexus.homestead.com/files/bof.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmm.. /boggle</span><hr size=1> here is the thing  i think should stay teh way it is the camp was ment to be long and hard thus causeing a balance effect clerics epic bar this one camp is easy i myself am ready for rage after tonight but i cant spend hours and hours camping him this i understand as for the monk thats not a legit claim to a camp i feel must be the cleric camping it regardless if it is the clerics monk or not most people i see complaining (excluding this post) are people that play maybe once week for ten mintues <br>

the game is design to show dedication if you cant dedicate to the camp you dont deserve the spawn <br>
<br>
<br>
Epics are ment to be held by l33t poeple not everyone and trying to work out a way every cleric can have is wrong that is not with in the scope of teh games design but then again pharming or twinking is not in the games design ither ubut ti happens <br>

No.  I had to fear / atone many of these, late at night, alone, if I die, no way to get back, if I had a monk I would have played the monk.  You haven't done the camp, so I don't think you have any experience to make judgement calls on the camp.<br>

if it was easy everyone would have one (granted that sounds nice) <br>
besides i dont really care honestly i will have my epic soon enough. because i have the patients and the drive just need to find the time. <br>
im lev 52 thats rigth 52 and as for rotation based on lev not fair. really so since i had the abilty and the resources to get everything for my epic before i was 52 means i should have to wait till all the lev 60 have theres. not fair. that is why i dont think a rotation is a good thing mainly because i would be at the bottom and i worked just as hard as any lev 60 to get to this point <br>
so flame me again please i can take it  can you  <p><img src="

Someting I found out when inquiring about rage from a cleric in-line for rage.  I added my name do the nature of this Fcking camp.  Damn VI's near sighted &quot;Vision&quot;!<br>
<br>
A list has been started and at present I am 9th in line.  If you want more info, do a /who all cleric(some level) and talk to someone in Soldungb.<br>
<br>
If you see me online send a tell, I will let you know what I know, lol which isn't much.<br>

There are valid arguements pro and con for such a system, but the one we have works extremely well, and we have MANY MANY rez sticks walking around Luclin due to this system. It also allows people who aren't in Large uber guilds to have a chance too. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://elementsofpower.20m.com"><IMG SRC="http://webster.ij.net/~eop/newbicsig2.gif" ALT="GIMME A BEER!!
