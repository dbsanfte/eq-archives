for Naggy. I've just been asking for a clarification on the rules that Twiggie set out.<br>
<br>
Why make a distinction between alts and mains? That's all I want to know.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact that the end-game guilds are not interested in Nagafen or Vox, but if they want to sign up their alts for a bit of low-end epic-bashing, I have no problem with that.<br>
<br>
Personally I didn't see any great problems with the old system (other than the list length), but I'll gladly accept that Twiggie was watching the list carefully, and could see some ways to improve matters. No argument here.<br>
<br>
I don't think I ever said anything approaching <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;We love having alts get loot. As long as it isn't yours, cause you got too much stuff. If its ours its ok. We just want a system that lets us get loot&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Now if others have (over the course of several posts here), fair enough, but that's certainly not my position.<br>
<br>
Let me rephrase the question: with enough 'secret squirrel' alts running round the server claiming rolls on loot that casual mains would love, what is the point in making a requirement for the characters to be primaries? It seems to me it just penalises the honest people who declare that their alts are such, and encourages people to hide their rep behind their alts' names. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucamala.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/7/02 4:21:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Vox/Nagafen rules posted and effective immediately.</span><hr size=1> IMO the &quot;small guy&quot; is not someone of low lvl, its someone who is not in a large guild. if you have a high lvl in a guild that is not able to kill kunark dragons your best chance to ever killl a dragon is naggy/vox with your alt. <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure no one would &quot;monopolize&quot; naggy or vox if they was ffa, thats not really an argument here.<br>
<br>
biggest problem of trak rotation (and why we don't have official new rotations) seems to be that people who couldn't kill something in an ffa environment could do it with the rotation. now we're doing the opposite thing: people who could kill naggy/vox with ffa are not allowed to get on the list. i don't think this is the right way to go.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
allowing alts to support raids will give uberguilds the possibility to kill old world dragons. your argument is wrong here.<br>
<br>
if someone spends enough time on his alt to get it at the same lvl at someone others main why should he not be allowed to get loot? isn't that the uberguild argument: we put more time and effort into the game so why should we not get more out of it? now suddenly you seem to think differently? <p>Camala Ironarm<BR>

The reason it's different on vox and nag and ONLY on vox and nag is because Verant intentionally created level limits to carve out a niche for lower levels. Not indies. Not alts. Lower level raiders, independant or guilded. <br>
<br>
Different situation, different solution. I'd be content if it was FCFS too. But if we intend to have a reservation system that I have to abide by, then this is the one I want to see. One that restricts the raids as closely as possible to Verant's intended targets. <br>
<br>
Sorry, this isn't about who gets loot or who deserves loot. Its straight up an attempt to give the EXPERIENCE of raiding them to the people it is intended for. That's the whole argument for keeping them on rotations to begin with. And this is the system that does that. Sorry if it shorts you a chance at an RBB.  <p>60 Warlord<BR>

<br>
Yes, the additional reasons was to keep Uber levels from farming old world dragons for phat loot and Epics. I have heard of some 60's soloing Naggy before the cap was instituted.<br>
<br>
So is the better solution to have a black list of guilds that can do higher level dragons or is it better to try to impliment a no-alt clause? Not only must the question be which is fairer but also it needs to be which is easier to impliment. Since it is Twiggie that is handling the rotations, it is he that must answer this question. <br>
<br>
I think both sides have been well argued here and I do hope that Twiggie has been following this discussion and does what is best for the server and his asprine stocks.<br>

This is my point of view on this matter:<br>
<br>
I trust Twiggie.  While I don't always agree with his actions/changes, I believe he has more sense and experience in the matter and that changes are for the best.  It's good that there are agruments made from the changes, it means that people are checking the actions of each other and making compromises.  If there were no one to contest the changes, then no compromise would be made and even may lead to abuse of the system.  Checks and balances.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think everyone should have a chance at leading their own dragon raid; I too wish to lead one, as I find being a leader to be rewarding.  Yes, there are people who will maliciously abuse the system, but that is why these things are discussed:  To make sure no one is being punished more severly than the abuser.  It is disappointing to see that people are limited to what raids they can lead because of your guildstatus/level, but they should not turn their anger towards Twiggie for that change -- It is the ones who abused it who is to blame.<br>
<br>
While I would like to lead a Dragon raid, I fear that I may outlevel the restriction by the time my date comes up.  It is pitiful that it takes so long to realize what you would like to do later in levels.  Some people may have found this realization and too saw it too late -- They put their hopes in their alternate characters who could do what they could not because of their level.  <br>
<br>
Even when I reach 60, I hope to lead a Nagafen/Vox raid with an alternate character, and not be prevented from doing so because of my guildstatus and the level of my main character.  When that time comes, I hope that the changes won't be as significant as to prevent me from doing so.<br>
<br>
Hrm, I hope that wasn't too long.  Again, this is my view and opinion of the situation, not a question of the rules or such.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Just to point out, I will probably be leading it as an independant.  I am not or have ever been guilded.<br>

The 18 people list is not hard I gather, but I will not want to be put off because of &quot;guild status&quot;  Its actually a sad day when the social standings and numeric positioning of what &quot;guild&quot; we are with determines what we can and cannot do.  When I started this game, it was about reputation and helping others.  Now its about what your guild status is and who you are friends with and such.  If I wanted to see who could pee further I would just go back to work.   I am here for fun of others and myself.  I take nothing away from others and often give more than I should.  So I ask, Why, would I not be allowed to run a raid because I am not in a guild, or the guild is &quot;too high&quot; to do it?  If I am 52nd level, guess what...  I CANT go on a Gore or Sev Dragon raid can I?  Well I guess I could but I would be a liability, not an active participant.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have led a Naggy and a Vox raid, my guild got &quot;nothing&quot; out of these two raids.  (other than a couple hours of fun adn excitement)  We reserve nothing usually, we let all applicable roll, and it usually costs my guild a bit to do it.  All being said, I will not want to be refused to run a raid because my guild, or a guild I am affiliated with is &quot;too high&quot; to do it.  Again I do not have a solution to the &quot;problem&quot; but at least my thoughts and feelings are spoken here and the fact that something should be done to fix this before people just stop acknowledging reservations all together. <p><p align="center"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b><a href="mailto:seanmodea@hotmail.com">Ediar Cylestiae</a>  </b>

If you want to lead a dragon raid <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> just to lead a dragon raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, go kill those.  I know a lot about WW and I'll gladly even give you whatever info you want on the zone.<br>

Crial, Derasinal, Onava, Uiliak, and Yeldema all look just like Nagafen.<br>
<br>
Atpaev, Cargalia, Del Sapara, Mav Sapara, Karkona, Kar Sapara, Jen Sapara, Rak Sapara, Vitaela, Von, Vraptin, and Zil Sapara all look just like Vox.<br>
<br>
And there are many others of different shapes and colors.<br>
<br>
And you can go kill them <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anytime you feel like it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You'll get a ton more loot in the hours in WW than you would on a Vox/Nagafen raid, enough that most all of your raiders will get something, unlike Vox/Nagafen where only 3-5 people end up with something.<br>

<br>
You can go visit the Kael Arena and squish Giants for a few days to re-coup the factin and perhaps get some plate drops. When you kill most arena mobs, you get +cov and -kromriff, - kromzek, and -tormax. <br>
<br>
Faction is no reason not to do something, as it is easily recoverable, except for the 'king' factions:  Dain, Tormax, and Yelinak.  As you can see, you don't gain tormax faction by killing most WW Dragons, nor do you get Yel faction for killing most in the area. There may be rare exceptions I am forgetting, but they are few and far between, this they don't help someone on a faction binge.<br>
<br>
However, the king mobs are really only for 'special' questing, to make a dumb generalization; and do not impeed travel through velious, nor does it necessarily impair doing the Armor Quests for any of the factions.<br>
<br>
As a by product of some faction hunting, you can receive turn-in items (dorf/giant heads, kobald items from velks) that you can turn in to the factions you are friendly with to gain those 'king' faction hits. <br>
<br>
But I digress.. boy do I digress...<br>
<br>
So... go try WW. :-) They are almost always up, and are a blast.  No, they are not vox/naggy level, but they are adequate at fulfilling the &quot;I want to raid a dragon&quot; criteria.<br>
<br>
There is no solution the &quot;I want to raid dragons whenver I want to, before I'm 53&quot; statement. Verant has 2 encounters of that level range, and the mods here have done their best with what they are given, IMO. <br>
<br>
I may or may not have gripes about the system, but until I can offer some sort of solution, I won't speak to it.<br>

<br>
Why would I go kill a dragon then work my faction back up to where it was when there are TWO PERFECTLY GOOD Dragons that dont screw with that faction that I am WITHIN LEVEL RANGE and WITHIN CAPABILITY of doing?  I dont really care about loot..  Play and have fun enough, loot will come in my eyes.  I am not saying that if these rules are inforced (which I believe they are no matter what we discuss here..) I would not be eligable to do Dragons, I just think its kinda crappy the way that when the &quot;known&quot; population of this server finds something not worth their prescious time, they deem it unreservable or &quot;needs a major change&quot;.  I have been here for over three years now and have seen this happen more than once now.<br>
<br>
I thought the let one guild per list was working just fine but alas, that was to be changed too.  Are we going to start policing twinks being let onto raids now?  Or &quot;if you are not a main char, you cannot host a Planar raid&quot; now too?  It would seem that if you are waaaay above level to do &quot;simple armor mobs&quot; in Hate or Fear, YOU should not be allowed to reserve a slot there either.  Fair is fair and if you are going for a God, reserve away, but twenty 60th level people core hosting a HAte raid to get their &quot;guild&quot; some armor drops seems far more done than &quot;take out Naggy/Vox for loot&quot;.  (yes the spawn time does make a small difference here, but not much)<br>
<br>
I have said it before and I will say it again, I do NOT have a solution, but I am at least pointing out problems I see and forsee with the way things are now.  I am working on ideas, just like the rest of you that could help this a little.  But, I am however, not going to let my thoughts and views go unannounced just because I dont have a solution.  I am not here complaining due to change, I am here to make points that are hopefully being taken into consideration in the end.  A solution will be found eventually, even if most like it or not.  But the fact of the matter is, for it to work (remember Fire Giants) people have to follow it... <p><p align="center"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><b><a href="mailto:seanmodea@hotmail.com">Ediar Cylestiae</a>  </b>

No, you don't have to agree with his opinions, but I hope you at least understand his reasoning. Saying<br>

<br>
Jaradis, as well as all the other mods, have nothing to gain from this decision.  It was done to try and help the target raiders, people like you, have more access to the ONLY 2 perfectly good dragons available to you.<br>

I said those that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only want to lead an indy Vox/Nagafen raid JUST to lead a dragon raid</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> should go to WW.  I'm not talking about the guilds doing Vox/Nagafen that are in level range of Vox/Nagafen.  I'm talking about the level 55+ INDIES that keep wanting to be on the list &quot;just so they can lead a dragon raid&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for the faction, it is easily fixed.  Also, if you are still on the Vox/Nagefen raids you can't do ToV anyway so it really doesn't matter if you kill Dragons now.  If you are still under 52 then the armor from West Wastes dragons is probably a big upgrade.  It takes no time at all to kill in Kael to get CoV faction back if you want that as you get 55+.  Dragon faction has to be by far the easiest &quot;king&quot; faction to ignore for the longest time.  Yelinak is the ONLY mob on Yelinak faction now.  So you can go anywhere in Skyshrine, Cobalt Scar, ToV, and West Wastes without worrying about having bad Yelinak faction.  You can't say that about bad Tormax faction since you can't even get to the quest givers with bad Tormax faction short of sneak/coh and even then that doesn't always help.  As far as I know Yelinak only is needed for one quest and thats with Tormax's Head so not something most need to worry about.  It takes 2-3 raids to Kael to get non-kos to CoV, and you can get Thurgadin armor while doing it. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=maroon,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>

I should have added for more clarity, the reason I wanted to lead the raid is because it felt rewarding -- that is, to be teaching younger raiders the skills needed in the future.  Unfortunatly as many have stated and restated, it's rare to find someone who is totally new to the experience as I was only a month ago.  There isn't much to it anyway, the strategies can be looked up or they can attend raids and find out for themselves.  Lame excuse indeed, but then again, saying you wish to do it for loot would sound more realistic, right ?  Or is it perhaps there are people who exist with different intentions after all... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I can accept not being able to lead a raid, just my quips of thought.  I tend to ramble when it's this late. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I knew the disadvantages of being unguilded, and I know the disadvantages of being guilded...  <br>

Hmm.. I want to ask about your signature Twiggie, but I'm afraid it would be off the topic. <p><font face='arial' size='1'>
