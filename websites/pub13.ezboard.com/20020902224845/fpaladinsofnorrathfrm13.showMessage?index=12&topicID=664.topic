If warriors are given a superior taunt for exp groups then what spot will I have?  Why stick in a low dps tank when a warrior can hold agro, tank better and do more dmg?Why pick a paladin for an empty slot when rog/rng/monk can do more dmg?  On raids we will have a place, but in exp groups we will be back to lfg for hours/days.<br>

Anything you do to improve warriors has the serious potential of regulating paladins to a non wanted class, again. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

<br>
Should warriors and clerics be more desirable than paladins and alternative healers in ALL situations? That seems a bit unjust. There SHOULD be situations where a paladin is more desirable than a warrior and there should be situations where a warrior is more desirable than a paladin. The only FAIR alternative is for warriors and paladins to be equally desirable in all situations, and that is never going to happen.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see a case &quot;in the real world&quot; where someone has turned down a warrior because they are waiting for a paladin. I have, however, seen MANY cases where paladins can't get a group because people want a warrior or a raid can't happen because there is no warrior to tank the mob.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, people who think that the only good thing a paladin brings to a group is the ability to hold aggro is crazy. Warriors should be able to hold aggro as well as we can, but that should be due to taunt skill or pure damage output. Paladins SHOULD be able to steal aggro from a warrior if they choose to do so, but it should remain a bad idea for a paladin to do it (in most cases). <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

They were THE class to pick for exp group tanking.  Sure you might take a paladin if they were a guildmate or friend, but on the whole a warrior was getting the spot.  Now that they are seeing us as close to them they want that suprierority again.<br>
<br>
I for one don't like that.  I can't blame them for wanting to make sure they are the only ones wanted to tank in a group, but that kind of balance sucks for us paladins.  If we aren't tanking in an exp group then we are taking up a better dps classes spot. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

Its the initital acquiring aggro thats the problem. <br>
<br>
You just said yourself - a Paladin can taunt off a warrior if they choose to. Can the reverse happen? Can a warrior taunt off a Paladin if he chooses to? <br>
<br>
What if we add an overnuking wizard to the equation. Can a Paladin taunt off an overnuking wizard? The answer is quite easily. Can a warrior do the same? The answer there is no. Thats the difference.<br>
<br>
Exp groups at level 60 want one thing - fastest exp/hour. To do that, you need extremely high DPS that rogues, monks, wizards, and mages bring to a group. Now, to counter the overaggro'ing ability of those above classes, then sure as hell don't ask a warrior to come tank for them with his gimped taunting ability... they ask a Paladin. THATS where the problem lies<br>

We are meant to be tanks, no matter what any warrior thinks. We may not be meant to be AS good as warriors, but the fact is that we should be able to hold our own very well. I also believe that warriors ARE better tanks, simply because they have higher hp and skill caps in avoidance areas. There is more then one reason groups take pal/sks over warriors. Think of what we can do besides tank. I cant even think of how many times my LoH or extra healing has saved the group in a situation where a warrior would have died and took the rest of the group with him. Warriors dont need better taunt because if the group or raiding party know what its doing, its going to know how to manage the agro it generates. Warriors in fact, do not NEED anything. I have yet to find a group that wouldnt take a warrior over a paladin even though we would probably be the better choice. On the other hand you have raids, and on MOST high end MOBs a warrior is essential. The top 2% guilds may prefer monks to tank things in some situations because by then the ac and hp on monks and warriors in pretty much even, but any kind of encounter that needs defensive will need a warrior, no other class can do it. I guess it all narrows down to the old saying &quot;The grass is always greener on the other side.&quot;.  The warrior who made that post seems to think that groups take pal/sks over warriors in every instance. Most paladins and SKs however will tell you the exact opposite. So all in all, I agree with the statement that it is just an envy post. The same thing that anyone who was around before and after kunark saw almost every day from every class(except necros, at the time they didnt have anything to complain about). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugeentrueblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geen Trueblade</A> at: 8/7/02 1:31:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwulf9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wulf9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 523<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/7/02 1:55:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=664.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aggro via taunt</span><hr size=1> firstly there is no reason why taunt should not properly work on all mobs.  A maxed level character should be able to taunt anything with full effectiveness.<br>
<br>
I don't think hybrids and warriors are the issue.  I have been doing Cleric/Paladin duos and groups forever, I used Paladin in the tank role in every era with success.  Warriors have strong disciplines and a key raid role, hybrids have spells and in my opinion a tad more exp value.  That is if the taunt issue were fixed.<br>
<br>
What I really do think is a problem is the other pure melee.  It seems the devs have always had the attitude that monk/rogue/warrior = PURE melee.  Pure Melee MUST be comparable or superior to all others in all aspects of MELEE.  That is the key mistake.<br>
<br>
Monks and Rogues should not be taking damage.  Rogues being a chain class is a joke.  They should have superior offensive abilities.  But to have them able to tank with ease just skews the whole game.  <br>
<br>
Warriors lose some group/solo usefulness to hybrids, gaining dps and raid need.  It balances out ok.  But to monks, for example, they lose solo and exp group usefulness, they lose DPS and they do not really gain in raid need.  They lose all around.<br>
<br>
Issues IMO -<br>
<br>
Mitigation needs to be fixed.  It screws up class roles bigtime when all absorb damage so easily.<br>
<br>
Offensive melee should not have defensive abilities comparable with defensive classes, even omg hybrids.<br>
<br>
Warriors need a quick taunt.  Perhaps a +aggro taunt button. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=664.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=664.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=664.topic&index=5><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=664.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.threadControl?topicID=664.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=664.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=664.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm21">Class Balancing</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13>Crusader's Warhall</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
