I have to agree with those other males who basically said that while proud and happy to be male, I can't help but feel somewhat embarassed too for the behavior of some of the others.  Personally, I love to help out folks, newbie or otherwise.  However, it didn't take long after starting my char that I realized the advantages that the women have in terms of free (and sometimes unwanted) stuff.  So, while I work hard at helping everyone, regardless of gender, I also try my best to help out any newbie men I see too.  Way I see it, nobody else will, so someone should make sure they feel welcome too.  Still in the middle of colecting raw-hide for a couple half-elf brothers I met..... (hey, I may be generous, but I'm POOR too :) ) <BR>  <BR> I have a good friend who speaks to me often about the amount of attention she receives with her wood elf druid(s).  On one server, a GM (!!!)(and yes, she actually checked for his name on the roster) actually approached her (he at level 50, her at 1) and started to hit on her when she said hi while walking by.  They talked for a bit, and before she knew it he was 1) handing over a crap load of stuff and 2) asking her to marry him when she reached level 20.  This was after her char had been alive 30-45 minutes, all but 5 of which had been spent talking to this GM.  Now I will readily admit she is a wonderful person, and great fun to talk to, but isn't that a tad early in their &quot;relationship&quot; for engagement?  On another server, she actually had two guys so enamored with her that they wanted her to destroy her original char and create two new ones for them to marry after they power-leveled each one.  This lead to a hilarious situation in which (b/c of his ridiculous jealousy) I went to visit her in my RL fiancee's char (yet another female wood elf druid).  He hits on me, I flirt back, he eventually leaves, we laugh about it, and then two other males show up and begin flirting with us.  It was hilarious: she was preoccupied with /tells from yet another suiter at the time (there were four for this char total), so I handled all the flirting back.  I was crying from laughter in RL from the insanity of it all, and I had to laugh even harder when I left the situation with more gear for my RL fiancee's char I was playing.  I took my friend's comment that had she met me in that char she'd have thought I truly was a woman from the personality and mannerisms I used to be very high praise. :)  Shoot, maybe I SHOULD go back into acting....She has since decided to create yet another druid for herself (we're her fav class) and only reveal its connection to her other chars to myself and her family members who play.  It's sad, really, though, that so many guys try for her attention (she's just too nice and sweet with them, that's my opinion) she can't feel comfortable playing her old char. <BR>  <BR> Anyway, just wanted to say &quot;Yes, ladies, you truly have reason to think men are idiots for the behavior many show you, but please remember that a few of us are still worth grouping with.&quot; :) <BR>  <BR> Belodion Wolftanzen <BR> Order of Light <BR> The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Brisblood </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333399>(11/28/99 3:59:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Funny is all i can think of  =)</span><hr size=1> My first char i made was a male paladin half elf. <BR> I hit on chicks of higher lvl and they would give me stuff. <BR> God i can still go to xegony and have a chick go get me equips. hehe <BR> I also made a female necro and what do you know?? its even easier to get males <BR> to run and get me nice stuff.
