<br>
For the folks that you mentioned, those classes are viewed as &quot;plate&quot; wearing classes.  Though their &quot;plate&quot; is less than warrior &quot;plate.&quot;  I don't have the exact stats for each piece in front of me, but these groups have been intentionally grouped AC-wise for some time.  To my knowledge.<br>
<br>
Bards have raised their fists in anger everytime Verant goofed on our AC and placed us with the &quot;chain&quot; wearing classes.  Happened with Hate plane armor and again with Kunark.  They fixed Hate's, but not sure on Kunark.<br>
<br>
I won't get into a discussion on the theories behind who should have what for AC.  Personally, I think it's odd that a bard wears plate.  Maybe we are jukeboxes...<br>

(Or so I've been told) However, the pure melee classes, at this time, were horribly broken, and to fix this, Verant gave the warrior Crafted armor, a better breed of armor than any of the other plate, and also introduced the otehr class armors.  Till now, they've refused to change this stratification of the armor, since the warrior and rogue were still broken. However, they're not quite so bad anymore, and they can go back to that original seperation by skills and spells, at least at the highest levels. <br>

Stat buffs on the planar gear is better than quest armor.<br>

On the other hand, Kunark armor is better AC, and (as a rule) each piece (other than the BP) proc's something. Now this is where the Bards really took a slap.. Their boots proc WHAT??? Where was the logic in THAT proc?<br>

As an SK, I sure am not gonna complain about Blood Ember, and any Warrior who whines about Cobolt needs their butts whupped bad.

i'd trade you your summon water and food effects for the effect on my gloves any day !<br>
<br>
now for the helm and bracers... well guess what ? only the fatties need the effect on the bracer and the humans and barbarians for the helm ( shrink on the bracer and serpent sight on the helm )<br>
<br>
invigor ? i'd LOVE to have that spell !<br>
eye of zomm ? as a puller without fd i can tell you i dream of that spell<br>
<br>
of course they dont change your class or add real new things... but look around, none of the effects on any armor does that<br>
they are meant to save mana or help out in the every day life<br>
<br>
just the warrior effects :<br>
gloves : reckless strengh = junk ( raises out str then slowly decreases... and ends up LOWERING our strengh<br>
plus it only lasts for one minute<br>
<br>
bracers : shrink = only good for 3 races ( well 2 and a half ) out of 10<br>
<br>
arms : lesser shielding, adds 8 ac and 30 hps.. not bad but doesnt stack with the shaman talisman line ( altuna kragg... )<br>
<br>
helm : serpent sight, ultravision... well only good for barbs and humans... 2 races out of 10...<br>
<br>
boots : strengh of the kunzar, 25 str lasts for a good while... self only but still a nice effect<br>
<br>
leggings : invis, nice one<br>
<br>
BP : invigorate<br>
<br>
i'm not saying that we got screwed ( except for the gloves... this is a very bad effect ) but our effects are far from being better than anyones <p><BR>

<br>
Everyone in Everquests agrees that warriors received the best Armor upgrade, except Dynin. ROFL...<br>
<br>
Warriors could have received &quot;Kunark gloves&quot; AC 75, STR40, Effect: Icecomet, and Dynin would find a reason to say its not good enough.<br>
_________<br>
<br>
But this topic is not about warriors, its about a comparison of Hybrid armor AC.<br>
<br>
My original question was referring to no discrepencies in AC between some of the Hybrids Kunark armor.  I was under the impression that there was supposed to be an AC difference between the classes.  So since some of the armor has the exact same AC as other classes what is it that is supposed to differentiate the class armor?<br>
<br>
Bards, Paladins, Clerics, and Shadowknights all have the same AC armor and equal stats to match their class.  However, each class is supposed to fullfill different rolls within the group.  Why would a cleric need the same AC as a Shadowknight?  or a Bard the same as a Paladin?  Planar armor between these classes are not the same, I am not sure why the gap was closed in Kunark armor.<br>
<br>
And I dont agree with the statement:, &quot;well *insert class* need AC because they get hit hard when mobs aggro due to *insert job*&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerics are not front line fighters, and should not have the same AC as those who are.<br>
<br>
Damn, I didn't want this to turn into a class envy post, but I can't let them rangers (and Dynin) do all the whining! <p>Qualtar Shylok --

Defense, dodge, parry, riposte, all of these have an effect, and it's still gonna wind up highest on the Paladin (Due to his self buffing), and the SK. If all the plate mail is about the same thickness of similiar metals, why shouldn't it all give the same raw AC? The only thing that would then cause it to vary in anyway is enchantments, and plus, it's really just silly to give a paladin or SK a double advantange in his AC over a cleric or ranger, the way the warrior has it over the rest of us... The class itself then makes the difference, not silly armor variations ment to balance a melee system that was once horribly broken. <br>
And yeah, shrink and Serpent sight are silly things to put on very high level warrior gear... But then, what massive percentage of the warriors out there are one of the three large races? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>--<br>

<br>
hehe, I am in agreement with that!... I want cobalt AC!<br>
<br>
Clerics have better AC and HP buffs than Paladins and SK's.  Bards not only have the AC/HP/haste buffs, but they also have the ability to lower the mobs AC as well as various other stuff.  To me thats a good reason for secondary tanks to have higher Raw AC than them.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is silly to give Paladins and and SK's higher AC than clerics or rangers (who brought rangers into this topic?).  We have different rolls.  Clerics roll is to heal, and a good cleric can heal without attracting mobs attention.  Paladins/SK's is to take damage.<br>
<br>
______________________<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, again, anything a warrior got spell wise on their kunark armor made them &quot;better&quot; than before. Even if it was as little as serpent sight.  Most everyone else just got the shaft as far as the &quot;effects&quot; go, save for maybe one or two items.  Really, who uses effects that actually LOWER your AC?  these spells are no different than cursed items.  <br>
<br>
WHAT, you say?  Thats right I said some of them actually LOWER your AC and are no different than cursed items.  <br>
<br>
Deepwater Helm AC21 Effect: Daring.  To me that translates into a helm with these stats:<br>
<br>
Deepwater Helm AC21, -85hps, -5AC.  <br>
<br>
Oh gee!?  are those negative stats?  holy cow!  Thats right do you think I am going to &quot;save mana&quot;  at the cost of losing stats?  I don't think so.  Thats the way it is for most every class who got effects on their armor cept warriors who were never able to cast spells before.<br>
<br>
Don't make me go down this road of itemizing each piece.... Bottomline,  I don't want to hear any comments on warriors ever again.  I am not comparing my class to them, as I know what my roll is and wouldn't trade my Paly for a warrior ever!  <br>
<br>
The topic was about AC differences between &quot;certain&quot; Hybrids (hehe, and clerics, but not rangers).<br>
<br>
If you want to talk about rangers look up Plainswalker, I think he has a thread going about how 'jipped' his class is as well.<br>
<br>
Bottomline IMO Armor AC is a major factor in differentiating between the classes and their rolls.  Each class has their specific &quot;spells&quot; that mold their class, but Weapon Performance and Armor Class are the two most important aspects of the &quot;fighting&quot; classes.  None of these Hybrids had the same AC armor prior to Kunark, why do they have it now? <p>Qualtar Shylok --

<br>
Seriously though, our higher defensive skill caps are way more important than the ac on our armor.  And sure, in a boring little dungeon crawl a cleric can heal without getting hit, but if you ever take some risks you know your cleric is gonna take a beating.  The last thing I want to see is my cleric saying &quot;Well...i woulda healed you man, but I have such low ac, i didn't want to get a mob agro on me! Gosh no!&quot;<br>

The only class who has a major problem with their defense is rangers, and that's only because of the skill caps, their kunark armor is fine ac-wise.  Armor is fine, believe me =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ufalretheverdieing.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falreth Everdieing</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.aol.com/dawindow/jc.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(9/3/00 1:29:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.tripod.com/~Chibi_Hentai/Ds_nei1.gif heigth=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kunark Armor</span><hr size=1> Bah why do bards get a greater inc in ac over their planer armor then pallies and sks.  sheesh bards go up 5 ac on their guants alone and pallies and sks only 3 ie that makes bard kunark armor that much better then sk and palli armor even though techinially its the same ac as the palli sk armor its a whole bunch better then thier previouis armor ie a bigger inc. <p><i><b>Falreth Everdieing<br><b>48th <i>Paladin of Marr<br><u>Brell serilis Server<br>Member<br><b>Quorum Angelus<br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg" broder="0"> <br><I>....some say the glass is half empty<br><i>....some say the glass is half full<br><i>....i say ....

<br>
I don't quite follow how bards get off with higher AC on armour than we do when they got all the songs to go reduce AC on a mob (ok we can do it too by a whopping 10 using 120mana... what a god damn joke!)<br>
<br>
They get the speed and buff songs which we don't get and yet we get screwed over with our armour.<br>

You want cleric armor nerfed?<br>
<br>
As far as fighting in any kind of dangerous situation, the cleric WILL get hit if he/she is doing his/her job right.  In fact many times I will heal early so I aggro mobs of the chanter, it's much easier for me to tank for a sec while they mez them than the chanter trying to mez while being hit, not to mention I have a much higher ac. <br>
<br>
True, clerics aren't tanks.  BUT... I don't know how many times high ac (I have 884 unbuffed) has saved my ass long enough to save someone else so the chanter can get it under control or someone can get an evac off.  I can heal without aggroing in many circumstances, but doing so often means you'll lose that enchanter, bard, or ranger.  I've wished many times that my defense would go up to 220, but I'm stuck with 200.  It's a class restriction, I'm not a tank, I can live with it.<br>

I realize that rangers do not duel weild 300/10 weapons, and Paladins have something better than 16/48 availible to them, and I know there is no 200% Haste Sash.  Those are exageration for effect...  but it gets the point across.  So stop typing your retort, dumbass.<br>
<br>
<br>
RANGERS!!!  STOP YER BITCHIN!!!<br>
<br>
The problem is not that your Kunark/Planar AC is too low... the Problem is that yer Etched Ivy AC is WAY TOO HIGH!  Originally, some of the best AC you wear going to get was AC12 on a chain BP.  Then it was AC15 on some banded, then it was AC16 on Mino Ribcage.  Then suddenly, it was AC19 on Rubicite... then they dropped Rubicite... and GAVE YOU BACK AC19!!!  Since the Pally/SKs only ended up with AC20 on the BP, your AC is only slightly lower...  AND YOU FREAKS KEEP IT IN YOUR MIND THAT YOU ARE A TANK!!!  You are no more a tank than a Rogue or a Monk.<br>
Yes, your AC is low... if you do not want to die as a ranger, then I suggest you stop using 300 damage/10 delay ranger weapons with a 200 Haste sash... if you do, then YES, YOU ARE GOING TO AGGRO THE FRICKEN MOB OVER THE PALLY WITH THE 16/55 Sword... or if he wants to bash too... a 6/28 axe.<br>
<br>
Bards...  you got screwed...  I am sorry man.  Bards got skill that most classes would KILL to have... but Bards ALREADY HAD.  SKs and Warriors would love summon food/water... bards have forage.  Invigor?  They get a better song before level 3.  Well  Invigor is worthless to everyone... anyone with a clue has over 100 stamina, so loss of the stam bar is TOTALLY MEANINGLESS.<br>
<br>
Monks...  You got screwed...  Sorry man ( Their Kunark armor is WORSE than planar)<br>
<br>
Rogues... excellent AC for a CHAIN class, and spells... not alot of complaints they can add.<br>
<br>
Warriors...  Insane AC, plus effects...  and some dumbass thinks he can still complain... geez.  ONE of the effects suck?  Jesus, YOU DIDNT HAVE THE EFFECT BEFOREHAND... DO NOT USE IT AND YOU ARE NOT OUT ANYTHING!!!<br>
<br>
PALLIES/SKs...  Screwed.  TOTALLY Screwed.  75% of the AC of a Warrior... and instead of new effects, we get spells we got at level 15-30... on our 55+ armor.  Now, exactly WHEN is anyone going to use a FD with a LOOOOONG casting time?  How does that save me a spell slot.  When exactly am I going to use a DoT on my armor that I got at level 15... and a necro gets at level 8!!!  The effect on the Pally BP requires a REAGENT!!!  <br>
