Someone argue the other side for me </span><hr size=1>   I'll state up front that I am a proponent of the AC is king school. I tailor my gear for maximum AC and mana items are purely incidental for me.  The only time I break this rule is when special resist gear is called for.  What got me thinking about this is the other day I happened to inspect a guildmate of mine who happens to be the same level as myself.  Our gear was very different despite both of us having the same opportunies to loot high end druid equipment on guild raids.  I sport an 865 ac while maintaining 200 wisdom.  Her AC is in the 760 range.  Her edge on me is about 170 mana in mana boosting items.  I don't get it.<br>
Sacrifice 100 AC for not even enough mana for an extra scorcie when you start at full mana?  This doesn't even make sense to me for soloing purposes.  Anyways, if someone is willing to outline the arguements for the mana schooh of thought for me I'd appreciate it and look forward to hearing your thoughts.<br>

after you have answered those questions, THEN you determine what your equipment needs are.  soloers or those who find themselves OOM a lot should focus on increasing their mana pool moreso than on ac.  if you play primarily in guild raids, then resists are better for you.  someone who is primary healer and gets hit a lot should take a serious look at their ac.  there is no one way to set up your gear, not when there are so many different ways to play.<br>

<br>
(Note: this is a hypothetical &quot;I&quot;, and not the real me)<br>
<br>
I primarily play EQ in two ways.  I either group, or I am solo.<br>
<br>
When I solo, I quad-kite.  If I do this right, I never get hit, or at most, get hit just a couple of times.  Having the maximum amount of mana is very important to me, not because I need it for everyday use, but for something goes wrong.  Having enough mana means that I can deal with adds, or having to regroup the quad or whatnot instead of having to zone.  Because I never get hit because I am always sowed and my targets are always snared, the AC isn't that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
Also when I am soloing I like to try and find things I can kill more batches in one sitting.  The reason for this is because I like to kill however many I can, and then just med and go AFK (since I can find a safe spot to med).  Since I don't always get back to the computer right when I hit FM, having more mana means I will have more mana overall.  For example, I can kill two suits in wakening on 1 bar of mana.  Then I go afk for a while and come back and kill 2 more.  If I could only kill one, I couldn't go afk as long, and since I am spending more number of times I go afk, I am being more inefficient (because each time I go afk there is some inefficiency built in).<br>
<br>
The other part of EQ I spend grouped.  I regularly partner with a warrior/monk who both are 2 levels higher than I am.  Also I almost always group with an enchanter.  Thus I never need to pull and rarely have to do crowd control.  I'm good at agro management so I don't get beat on.  Having more mana means that if a big pull comes in and then repops happen for example, I can accelerate my damage output (while still managing agro) so things die quicker so my enchanter doesn't go OOM from crowd control.  If I had less mana, I wouldn't be able to help things die quicker as much, and the enchanter or cleric might get to OOM and then we would have to evac.  Again, I don't get hit a lot because I don't have to pull, and I don't usually have to do crowd control, and I'm good at managing agro.<br>

<br>
If you're leveling solo (read-killing blues steadly) you're probably not being hit often, AC becomes less necessary, and mana an issue of life or death.  Leveling in groups varies; in a typical group you need even mana/ac, playing DruidCleric you need mana, playing DruidTank you need AC.<br>
<br>
On raids, AC (and resists of course) is the * only * thing that will keep you alive. I finally broke 1000 ac (1017 ac buffed with aegolism/augment and bladecoat- I can't cast PotG yet, and yes, I know there are higher AC buff combos that can be cast.) I noticed improvement at 800/900/950ac but the difference between 999/1000 settled any dispuit in my mind. Mobs simply can NOT do the damage they used to do. Example: Casting sundering and fixation on the Dain. With 986ac,  death count 4 for Dain, 4 for me.  Post 1000ac, death count 3 for Dain, 0 for me. <br>
<br>
There will alwawys be three sides on this issue.  AC lovers, Mana lovers, and people like me, who carry a 10 slot bag of  AC/mana and full resist gear at all times. To each their own!<br>

<br>
I have a quick question for you -- I spend my time 50/50 solo/grouping.  I haven't spent much time doing any melee and therefore have been hit by mobs quite rarely since around level 24.  (I'm level 42 now)  My AC is very low, I believe it's just under 300.  My equipment is good, the problem is that since I've never been hit much, my defense is extremely low.  <br>
<br>
So what can I do to raise my defense?  Do I just need to allow the mobs to hit me a couple of times in every fight?  I tried that when kiting dorfs last night, but didn't see my defense go up once (They do con blue to me though)<br>
<br>
Any advise?<br>
<br>
Thanks!  Safe travels all :)<br>

<br>
Thanks so much for your help!<br>
<br>
I spent the entire day letting Dwarves in BB beat the living crap out of me.  I root/dot, then porcupined til half life, then stepped back and healed.  After a full 8 hours though, my defense didn't go up once. It's currently at 22, which is shamefully low for level 42, I know. I've always kited and was rarely hit so it never went up! I didn't know it mattered til yesterday when I realized my AC is lower than most clerics.<br>
<br>
I then went to SolB with a group and let the cleric heal me while I allowed myself to be beaten senseless by every Kobald who passed by.  <br>
<br>
12 hours of playtime gave me 1 single point of defense.  <br>
<br>
Isn't there any way to do this quicker than that? Seems horribly slow.  Will it pick up pace after a certain level?<br>
<br>
Also, I'm a bit confused... what did you mean by re-rooting the mob would make my defense go up?  That was the only part that I was not sure of.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the help.<br>

You could raise your AC by over 450 points just by raising your defense. You're gonna need it and doing it at 42 is alot better then trying it at 50 plus. <br>

Well, I asked around and it appears that you cannot raise defense skill in pvp - not sure if it's different for pets though.<br>
<br>
Either way, I had a good successful night.  I &quot;tanked&quot; (for lack of a better term) for a party tonight; basically just whacked away as much as possible, took alot of beatings, etc.  Got 10 defense points in the day; which is fine by me!  I figure a couple of weeks and I'll be fine now.  If I get 10 per day for a couple more days; then hopefully it will pick up the pace as my AC gets higher and mobs miss me more often.  Perhaps after I get defense (100), I can start gaining 15-20 points in a day til 175ish when it slows down a bit again.<br>
<br>
I was quite depressed after reading this one guys post who told me I'd have to restart (He was rather ignorant as far as I'm concerned) but all the rest of you have given me some good ideas.  A little hard work and a few more days and hopefully I'll be where I should have been, to begin with.  Thank you :)<br>

Someone argue the other side for me </span><hr size=1> my opinion<br>
<br>
shoot for mid 180s wis then go for resists / ac<br>
but the fact of the matter is, most resist gear has nice ac, aka gladiator armor.<br>
with full cleric buffs i stand at 1012 ac, with all resists over 80, and 206 wis atm because i just recently obtained a few new items that pushed me over (overhaul time again).<br>
but all the same, alot of nice items out there for ac/ hp and wis at same time:<br>
<br>
gladiator legs: wis ac resists, what more you what?<br>
<br>
thurg / ss / kael quest armor: wis ac resists, normally high mana+, some good hp+<br>
<br>
vermiculated: low ac, but high wis, you can use it to get your wis up and then have an excuse to get higher ac / resist / hp equip<br>
<br>
idol of thorned: nice fairly inexpensive range slot w/ good ac and nice stam (hp)<br>
<br>
6 ac 65 hp rings: not bad in certain situations, although I prefer 8 to all resists<br>
<br>
elder spiritist armor: dont be fooled, this isnt the &quot;ac gear&quot; armor out there, so look around and you'll find stuff that kills it for ac and still has stats<br>
<br>
Flayed Paeb. gloves, coldain skin gloves: two nice choices for high ac gloves with good stats, paeb gloves are good resist stuff, then you got the coldain for wis / mana hp stuff, both have over 12 ac.<br>
<br>
Boots: kael quests reward you with some of the best boots in the game, although im not a big fan of the druid only ones from there (naturewalkers).  Shimmering terror hide boots from velks are nice, as are iksar boots. Personally i wear skyshrine quest boots (woven grass) because they are 50 mana, and 8 ac. I am a type of resist freak ;p and boots are also 2 to all resists. (btw boot stats: 8ac 15 dex 2 to all saves 50 mana cast sow)<br>
<br>
Held items: Sarnak shield / tanglewood / green dragon shield, i use tangle, and prefer it, high ac, high wis, some agi that makes for more ac, but all the same i got lucky to get it, sarnak is a good choice, and if you want more poison / disease, why not go green dragon shield?<br>
note that all the shields are 25 ac, but green dragon makes for slightly less due to -5 agi.<br>
<br>
Lodizal shield: best back slot item for dru in the game, is not hard to kill the mob, but we all wish it spawned more often, all the same, shoot for this for your back slot no matter what imho, 23 ac 10 wis and really nice resists makes it well worth it.<br>
<br>
Shoulders: why are all the better shoulders (ob death, obulous, draco) stuck at 10 ac? i need to do some reasearch in this area, i think i would wear draco shoulders tho over anything, if i ever win that friggin lotto hehe.<br>
<br>
ears: forest loops have the ac / wis / agi etc, why not use em, cheap too :).  If you want mana, treant tear drops in poa have been increased it seems, our guild got 5 last raid, and they are also 2 ac and 5 to all resists (40 mana too).  Orc fang ears or cougar ears might not be a bad choice if you are a total ac freak, i dunno, try em out heh.<br>
<br>
Neck: nos / ww talismans, all im gonna say, i think pretty much anyone prefers these<br>
<br>
head: tranix / froglock are cheap and nice ac, dain crown is killer stuff, but im not really talking about that level of equip here, talking about stuff most players could achieve easily.<br>
<br>
arms: gladiator, whats better? cause i wanna know too hehe<br>
<br>
paw: kinda funny you can get 9 ac 9 agi and 9 wis outta the same held item, granted i dont consider it worth using, but if your broke and dunno what to do for hand stuff, its not a bad choice.<br>
<br>
belt: pof belt is nice ac, draco is nice ac / stats, bcg is decent also<br>
<br>

Someone argue the other side for me </span><hr size=1> I got 14 skill raises last night in an hour or two off of the level 56 monk necro pet... any pet will do.  Just duel, have your necro friend haste the pet, hit it with Fixation of Ro if you have it, and let it beat you up a whole lot.  Heal yourself when you get low.  The necro can also do some healing and mana pumping on you to speed things up since s/he'll just be sitting there a lot of the time.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen a lot on this forum about the Chetari Bonecrafted Shield.  It's 19AC back slot and druid usable, and since not all of us can have Lodizal shields ... *shrug*<br>
<br>
As for earrings I go with electrum black sapphire ... 2ac 35hp 25 mana, what's not to like? <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

<br>
Also..<br>
<br>
High dexterity helps increase the chance of weapon skill raises.<br>
High strength helps increase the chance of offensive skill raises.<br>
<br>
Before level 60 go for WIS, Plus Mana, AC and Plus HP items in that order.<br>
<br>
After level 60 go for AC, Plus Mana, Plus HP and WIS items in that order. That's almost a total reversal with WIS moving from top to last and AC moving from 3rd to last to 1st.<br>
<br>
Only reason for having tons of mana is for AE kiting, but once  you hit level 60 you don't need exp anymore..<br>
<br>
Here's the truth..<br>
<br>
On any major raid you'll realize that by the time a big fight is over you will never be OOM. Druid nukes are just super slow compared to wizards if they even manage to hit a mob to begin with. On the flip side if you choose to heal you will go OOM and heals cannot be resisted. Basically you have two options.<br>
<br>
Cast 5 nukes for like 3K dmg and end up with half a bar of mana or Cast 10 heals for a full 10K and end up OOM.<br>
<br>
Druids get Nature's Touch which is 400 mana and heals 978 dmg. Cleric's get Divine Light which is 350 mana for 910 hp worth of heals.<br>
<br>
Now for the big shocker!<br>
<br>
If you really want to be a good druid. When you hit level 60 visit the Temple of Ro and Change your specilization from Evocation to Alteration. Plan to spend half a day in Rivervale chain casting Minor heal and playing Gems.<br>
<br>
So far I'm up to 150 in Alteration Specilization, Wave 51 and a high Gems score of 1.5 million...<br>
