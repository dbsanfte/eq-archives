The guards at the gate to the Keep made bets on how many of the young wannabe's would come running to them with a train of beasts hot on their tails.<br>
<br>
The many dark shadows in the mountain pass provided the cover she needed as Terolyn crept past the ledge occupied by the Gnolls. She did no fear the dog-like beasts, but she did not have time to play with them today either. There were other matters at hand that needed attending to.<br>
<br>
Hidden in the shadows she made her way through the winding, and often confusion, trails of the mountain pass. Though she loathed to be here, she knew the pass well enough that she no longer got lost and was soon standing outside the Lion’s Roar. She quickened her pace slightly as she stepped onto the fisherman’s wharf outside the inn, and taking a deep breath she plunged into the icy water that gave the residents of the pass their water. <br>
<br>
Terolyn sliced easily through the water, diving deep beneath the surface to a cave near the floor of the lake. She swam through the narrow tunnel that lead into an area of the pass closed off from the rest. The smuggler guarding the watery entrance eyed her questioningly as she broke the water’s surface, but otherwise ignored her as she climbed out of the water. <br>
<br>
Nimble fingers ran through ginger hair, ridding it of as much water as she could before tying it back away from her face again. It had been some time since she had been to the smuggler’s cove of High Hold Pass, but she remembered the way.<br>
<br>
And as she had expected, she had no sooner stepped into the open area of the cove than a voice echoed against the mountain walls.<br>
<br>
&quot; Anari Ravensblade, I heard you were dead.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn smirked and turned to face the human that approached her. &quot; Which time, McBale?&quot; <br>
<br>
Anson McBale, the smuggler lord, chuckled and came to stand before her. &quot; It’s been some time, Rogue, since you last graced us with your presence.&quot;<br>
<br>
She shrugged. &quot; What can I say, being dead does put a damper on one’s social calendar.&quot;<br>
<br>
His eyebrow arched at her comment. &quot; So the rumors are true then? You fell to the Harvester in Velious?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; That’s old news, my friend.&quot; Terolyn snickered softly. &quot; I would love to stay and catch up, but I’m here on business.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I expected nothing else.&quot; He motioned her to follow as he turned and headed for an area more private. The smuggler Lord sat himself on one of the many plush cushions he had strewn about a corner of the cove.  &quot; So, what can I do for you Anari?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; First of all, I don’t use that name anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded slowly, gesturing to the guild pin on the lapel of her cloak. &quot; Trying to be respectable?&quot;<br>
<br>
She laughed. &quot; Hardly. The Dragons provide me with what I need for the time being.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; And that would be?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her beautiful elven features darkened. &quot; You are still as curious as I remember, Anson. Haven’t you heard what curiosity did to the cat?&quot;<br>
<br>
 Anson cleared his throat nervously at the implication. &quot; So, what do you need from me this time, Rogue?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An elixir,&quot; she took a pouch of coins from her belt and tossed it to him.  &quot; You most potent paralysis poison, on that can be ingested.&quot;<br>
<br>
He lifted his eyes from the pouch to the deadly woman before him. &quot; A mark? I didn’t realize you were back in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I’m not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; A personal vendetta then? Going after the Harvester again are we?&quot;<br>
<br>
A sneer crossed her lips, and a soft growl sounded from the back of her throat. &quot; You ask too many questions, McBale. Why the sudden interest?&quot;<br>
<br>
He reached over to a box that lay not far from him, lifting the lid to expose the dozens of tiny bottles. &quot; I like to know what my poisons are being used for, purely selfish reasons I assure you. I enjoy hearing what they do to their intended victim.&quot; He removed a vial of a clear liquid from the chest and tossed it to Terolyn, who caught it easily out of the air. &quot; One drop of that mixed in a bottle of wine, or skin of ale, will render any who drink motionless in a matter a few minute. It will last long enough for you to slit their throats.&quot;<br>
<br>
She eyed the liquid inside the vial, a wicked smile replacing the sneer on her lips. &quot; And if I wanted it to last longer?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Increase the dosage. But any more than a few drops and you risk the poison being detected through taste or smell.   I would suggest only a drop or two, and when your victim is immobilized administer the rest as needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn slipped the vial into a pocket, and palmed an object unseen by McBale. &quot; I trust your discretion in this matter?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; My lips are sealed, my dear.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Let’s make sure they are, shall we?&quot; Her hand snapped up, the serrated metal disk in her hand flying out toward the unsuspecting smuggler.  The throwing star imbedded itself in the man’s throat, blood seeping from beneath the metal disk as he fought for breath. Another deadly disk shot through the air, sinking into the flesh just beneath the other.<br>
<br>
Anson McBale collapsed onto his side, his dead eyes staring horrifically at her.<br>
<br>
Moving quickly she hurried out of the cove, the shouts of the alarm echoing through the pass as the smuggler guarding the entrance fell into a pool of his own blood and she dove into the water once again.<br>

All but the Shadow that sat at a table in the corner of the main hall. On the table before her glowed a single candle, strewn about were several crystal goblets and wine steins. <br>
<br>
Her mind intent on her project, Terolyn dipped the lip of one of the goblets in a saucer of clear liquid. Moving the goblet to another shallow dish she laced the moist crystal with an opaque powder. Blowing gently on the glass she watched with satisfaction as the powder and liquid dried invisible against the goblet’s surface.<br>
<br>
A soft noise outside the hall alerted the rogue of the approach of someone, and as the door to the hall opened she covered the two saucers with her cloak. Terolyn looked up as Cresida entered the Dragons Guildhall.<br>
<br>
&quot; Terolyn!&quot; Cresida said in a surprised whisper when she noticed the Feir’Dal in the corner. &quot; I didn’t think anyone would be awake at the hour.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I couldn’t sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric raised a delicate eyebrow at her and at the contents of her table. &quot; So you thought you’d sit in a dark corner with a half-dozen empty glasses?&quot;<br>
<br>
She forced a smile and reached for a wine skin that hung off the back of her chair. &quot; I just finished working on something and thought I would have a drink.&quot; She poured the contents of the skin into two glasses, one the goblet she just finished tampering with. &quot; Would you care to join me for some Rathe Berry juice.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cresida hesitated a moment before crossing the room to sit across from Terolyn. She noticed the serious expression on her friends face and asked, &quot; Is everything alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn chuckled. &quot; Getting better all the time.&quot; She lifted her glass from the table, indicating for Cresida to do the same. &quot; I’ve hear that congradulations are in order for you. Getting married and having a baby, you must be happy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cresida nodded, taking the tampered goblet in hand. &quot; Aye, I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Then I’d like to propose a toast. To getting everything we’ve wanted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Something about the way Terolyn spoke sent a chill up Cresida’s spine, and she watched the rogue intently as they both raised their glasses to their lips.<br>
<br>
Terolyn pushed the sudden feeling of regret to the back of her mind as her glass hovered a hair’s breadth above her crimson lips. Cresida trusted her, and did not seem to hesitate as she took a drink from the goblet. Guilt overwhelmed her momentarily, but she ignored the feeling and set her glass back onto the table’s surface.<br>
<br>
&quot; Terolyn, what is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; The gods do not smile on us tonight my friend.&quot; Terolyn said as she pulled the cloak of the table that hid the two saucers. &quot; I’m sorry. If only you had not returned when you did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Koa’Dal eyes narrowed in confusion a moment before a sudden numbness began to sweep through her body.<br>
<br>
Terolyn rose from the table, pouring what was left of the liquid back into its vial. &quot; A paralysis poison. The same that your beloved Pendragon used when he tried to kill me. A variation of course, but the same effect none the less.&quot; She pocketed the vial, her emerald eyes shining menacingly in the candle light. The powder she replaced in a small satchel. &quot; And a sedative, strong enough that it would send the largest barbarian into slumber for hours.&quot; She knelt before the now unmoving cleric and brushed a strand of hair from Cresida’s face. <br>
<br>
Cresida could find no words, and it was not from any effects of the poisons. Her eyes frantically scanned the face of the rogue before her, trying to find any trace of the friend she once knew in the hate filled features of the woman. <br>
<br>
&quot; Do not worry about your baby, the drugs should have no effect on it.&quot; Terolyn got to her feet, and gathered her things. She kissed Cresida on the top of her head. &quot; You should have let him die, Cresida. None of this would be happening if you had just let him die. But it does not matter now. By the time I am through with him, there will be nothing left for you to bring back.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn watched the sedative take effect and the Koa’Dal slipped into unconsciousness. She looked at the elf’s frightened features for a moment before turning from the scene and exiting the hall. The test was successful, the mixture of the two drugs would be enough to bring down her unsuspecting prey. <br>
<br>
The hunt began.<br>

--------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Patches of moonlight illuminated the forest floor, filling the Faydark with silver light. Thought it was late and the moon would soon be setting in favor of the sun, a lone figure walked silently among the trees. She walked quickly, but without sound, obviously knowing the area well. Sapphire eyes glinted in the darkness beneath a black hooded cloak as she neared her destination and saw a light in the window. She had expected darkness at this hour. The figure spoke a syllable and vanished.<br>
<br>
A feeling of unease crept over Kassy as she approached the door of the Dragons' Hall. It hung slightly ajar, still moving. Invisible hands closed over the edge of the wooden door, pushing it slowly open. A single candle that stood on a table in the far corner lit the room, eerie shadows dancing over tables, chairs, and hearth-stones. Near the candle were several empty wine glasses. The Teir’Dal’s eyes fell then across the elven cleric lying motionless upon the stone floor.<br>
<br>
With the quickness of the elves, Kass was at her side. Cresida was breathing, her heartbeat calm, if a bit slow. Removing her long cloak, Kassy folded it and placed it beneath her head. She stood and looked at the table, lifting a glass. It appeared untampered with, just a wine glass. She put it back on the table, but picked it up again. From a pouch at her belt she took a pinch of silver dust and let it fall, drifting over the goblet as she murmured a few soft words. The glass began to glow purple... all but the rim, which remained clear. She set the glass on the table, not bothering to cast her enchantment upon the others, and knelt by the fallen Koada'dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cresida,&quot; she spoke the name quietly, fearing to wake the Dragons. &quot;Cresida, wake up...&quot; No response. <br>
<br>
The enchantress closed her eyes, searching her mind for the spell she desired. As the words came to her, she placed dark hands on the cleric's brow and over her heart. Kassy spoke, the spidery words of magic crackling in the air around her, &quot;Ar'anen halar. Et'intavaria. DiGrato b'las'io.&quot; The magic flowed through her and to the spell's target, striping the enchantments of sleep an paralysis. <br>
<br>
A moment passed, then two and still Cresida slept. Kassy began to fear that her spell would have no effect on ingested toxins when a movement caught her attention. Green eyes were looking up at her, confused and a little scared. &quot;Kassy...?&quot;<br>
<br>
The dark-skinned elf breathed a sigh of relief, &quot;Cresida, thank Tunare. What happened?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cresida looked up at the glasses sitting upon the table, her gaze falling curiously upon the one that still glowed faintly. &quot;Kassy, what are you doing here? And Terolyn,&quot; she asked, &quot;where is Terolyn?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I came here looking for her... she--&quot; Kassy's words died on her dark lips, ''Where is Minz?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz?&quot; the cleric looked puzzled, &quot;I don't know where he is--&quot;<br>
<br>
Her words were cut off as Kassy stood and turned toward the door. &quot;Do not eat or drink anything within the hall. Burn all of it. Boil every dish and piece of silverware the Dragons' own.&quot; She pulled a small sparkling object from a hidden pocket in her robe and tossed it to the cleric. Cresida's eyes widened as she caught the item and discovered it to be a large diamond. &quot;That will cover the cost of replacing it all. I should have known she'd do this...&quot;<br>
<br>
Before Cresida could even form a response, the enchantress had retrieved her cloak and was out the door and she was left to look from the gem in her hand to the poisoned glasses upon the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare guard us all,&quot; she whispered to the night. <br>
<br>

The instructor moved in again, his padded blade catching the half-elf across the back. The two paused their melee as the instructor showed her the proper defense technique.  Terolyn watched the two from her spot above the Grounds of Fate, a small smile on her lips.<br>
<br>
&quot; What are you doing here?&quot;<br>
<br>
The rogue turned her head away from the master and student, looking to the erudite that approached.  Her smile rapidly faded. &quot; I should have sent word I was coming, I’m sorry Mongul.&quot;<br>
<br>
The necromancers face was stern. &quot; That still doesn’t answer my question Ana-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; It’s Terolyn now.&quot;<br>
<br>
He guffawed as he came to stand next to her, resting against the stone ledge. &quot; Anari, Terolyn… Did I ever know who you were?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; That’s not fair,&quot; Terolyn sighed.<br>
<br>
&quot; When has this life every been fair?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; And when did you get so cynical?&quot; She shook her head. &quot; Look, I’m sorry I came.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mongul grabbed her arm as she turned to leave. &quot; She asks about you, you know. All the time. She misses you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn glanced at his chiseled featured that seemed to have suddenly grown very old. &quot; And what about you?&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled softly. &quot; Our time passed a long time ago. But she still needs you, she needs her mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ginger hair bounced as she shook her head again. &quot; She doesn’t need a mother like me.&quot; Gently pulling out of his grasp she took a few steps back. &quot; She’s not why I’m here. I need your help with someting, Mongul. There are others that could do it, but I know the quality would be the best if you were to do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded, recognizing the all-business look that now filled her face. &quot; You know I’ll help you where I can.&quot;<br>
<br>
She explained her idea to him, the necromancer nodding occasionally as she spoke. When she was finished he stared at her, trying to conceal his astonishment. &quot; It could work, though why you want to do this-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I promise, someday I’ll tell you everything.&quot; Terolyn smiled hopefully. &quot; So you’ll do it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mongul nodded. &quot; I’ll need to prepare things in my lab, but give me a day or two and everything will be ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Excelent. That will give me enough time to carry out my end of things.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; And what about her?&quot; He looked down at the half-elf sparring with the Instructor. &quot; Will you stay long enough to at least say hello this time? Terolyn? Ana?&quot; He looked around, sighing when he saw he was alone.<br>

Rain poured down around the rogue and her druid companion as they stepped out of the portal created by the druid’s magic, and within a matter of second both wood elves were soaked to the bone.   Terolyn ran beneath the shelter of one of the rings great stones, the druid following quickly behind. <br>
<br>
&quot; Perhaps we should wait until morning before we go looking for your friend,&quot; the druid shouted above a roar of thunder, &quot; At least wait until the storm has passed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn shook her head sending droplets of water flying from her hair. &quot; There’s no time. Now you’re sure this is where you brought him? A blind half-elf wearing the same guild pin as me?&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded. &quot; Aye. Just this morning. He had me point him east, said he’d be able to follow the mountain wall to where he was going. I didn’t like leaving him on his own, but he insisted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Wait here for us. I should be back with him by nightfall tomorrow. You’ll be needed to get us out of here quickly.&quot; She tossed him a small satchel of coins. &quot; You’ll get the rest of your payment when my friend and I are out of these mountain. And something extra for your time.&quot; <br>
<br>
He eyes the pouch, knowing well the platinum piece it held inside, and nodded emphatically. &quot; Yes Ma’am!&quot;<br>
<br>
The black rain was nearly blinding as she headed eastward away from the druid ring. There was only one place in that direction that Minz was familiar enough with to get to on his own.  Lucky for her she knew the area just as well and was able to run the entire way along the mountain and through the pass. <br>
<br>
She reached the rocky ledge high about the expanse of water an hour after leaving the druid behind. The rain had subsided, yet the dark clouds had still not parted.  She knew the quickest way to her destination would be to swim across the lake, but in the dark it would be easy to get turned around and she did not have time to deal with the aqua goblins or undertow skeletons she knew would be beneath the water’s surface.<br>
<br>
Determined to reach Minz before sunrise she set out south, following the waters edge, her ravenscale boots gripping precariously at time on the water slick stones. Yet even the balance of a nimble rogue will succumb to the elements, and her footing slipped. She slid along the rocky slope, the stone tearing through her leggings and into the flesh of her leg, as she scrambled for a hand hold. Her descent stopped as she fingers managed to grab hold of a jagged rock jutting out, her feet dangled off a sheer drop above the water. <br>
<br>
Gasping to catch her breath, she climbed her way back up the slope to the ledge where she collapsed  onto the wet stones. A flash of lightning tore the sky open, spilling the contents of the clouds again.  Terolyn could not help but laugh at the situation as the rain splattered against her face.<br>
<br>
&quot; Hello?! Are you alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tilting her head back, she saw a rain drenched wood elf making his was across the stone toward her.  She propped herself onto an elbow as he came to kneel beside her. &quot; I’m fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked to her leg and at the blood seeping from gashed on her hand. &quot; You do not look fine, Milady. Have you been wounded by the beats of this region?&quot;<br>
<br>
She chuckled. &quot; No, just a moment of clumsiness is all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I am Elmion Hendrys. My camp is near by, you are welcome to rest there while my companions and I tend to your wounds.&quot;<br>
<br>
With the realization she was not going anywhere else that night, she nodded and took the Feir’Dal’s offered hand.  Placing her arm around his shoulder he helped her move across the slippery ground and toward a fire that shone through the rain in the distance. <br>
<br>
&quot; Nyrien, Ghilanbiddle,&quot; Elmion called as they approached the camp. &quot; A hand if you will please.&quot;<br>
<br>
A white haired Koa’Dal stepped out of the tent and when he saw Terolyn he hurried to help Elmion carry her out of the rain. &quot; Goblins?&quot; <br>
<br>
She shook her head with a rueful  smile. &quot; Rock. I slipped.&quot;<br>
<br>
Pushing the flap of the tent aside, Elmion and the high elf helped her inside. The latter one smiled back. &quot; I am Nyrien, and I can assure you that there are many dangers in this land.&quot; He took her from the wood elf and guided her to a bed role. &quot; You may rest here if you like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; HA!&quot; A some-what squeaky voice pitched in indignantly. &quot; One like that one stands no chance within this realm. The goblins shall skin her alive!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Pipe down, Ghil!!&quot; Elmion snapped at the gnome that laid on a bedroll across the tent as he knelt beside Terolyn as Nyrien helped her down to the bedroll. &quot; We have no quarrel with-&quot; He raised an eyebrow curiously at her. &quot; I don’t believe I caught your name.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was no sense lying. The Dragons may be searching for her if Cresida told them anything, but it would not matter. They could not stop her now. &quot; Terolyn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Both elves smiled. Nyrien chanted a few soft words of magic and a pale blue light encircled his hands.  He held them above her leg. &quot; Will you accept a healing from Tunare, Lady Terolyn?&quot;<br>
<br>
She nodded in response, her emerald eyes intent on the disgruntled gnome that stared right back at her.<br>
<br>
His little pale nose wrinkled in irritation when the light of healing encompassed her leg and the gash began to mend. &quot; What business do you have here?!! Trying to keep safe? Expecting us to fight your battles? Bah!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I search for the Pendragon of my order.&quot; She removed the guild pin from her lapel and allowed Elmion to inspect it. &quot; He is in grave danger from someone who seeks him. He would not know of this threat, and would not know of it until too late.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; Bah!!&quot; Ghilanbiddle rose from his bedroll and stormed out of the tent. <br>
<br>
&quot; There was a man this afternoon who passed by our camp.&quot; Elmion stated handing the pin back to her. &quot; We offer aid to any who make their way through this realm, and I remember him because he asked if he were heading in the right direction. I found it odd since most who come this way know where they are goin and which direction it is&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; It took us a moment to realize that he was blind, but he did wear that same pin,&quot; Nyrien added. He took his hands away from her leg, revealing the smooth olive skin beneath the jagged tear in her pants. &quot; I have mended your wound, Lady Terolyn, though I’m afraid I can do nothing for your leggings.&quot;<br>
<br>
She flexed her leg, and smiled. &quot; My thanks, gentlemen. You did me not one kind service, but two. Now I know I am on the right trail of the Pendragon. Will you now do me one more service and join me in a drink?&quot; She reached into her pack and retrieved a wine skin from with. With a disarming smile she held it out for the two elves. &quot; It’s the least I can do after all you’ve done for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Ghil grumbled in the rain as he paced about the perimeter of the camp. Something about the woman had rubbed him the wrong way. Of course, he didn’t like anyone, but he liked her even less. Finally of a mind to tell his companions to get rid of her, he stormed back into the tent.<br>
<br>
&quot; Now look here you two! I-&quot;<br>
<br>
The words caught in his throat as he watched the woman rise from her feet, cleaning a blood stained dirk on the bed roll she sat on. Beside her lay the bodies of his friends, their throats slit and spilling their life’s blood.<br>
<br>
&quot; You are a rather rude little man, aren’t you - Ghil wasn’t it?&quot; Terolyn balanced the tip of the dirk on her finger as she stared menacingly at the gnome. &quot; Would it have killed you to be a little nicer to a stranger in need?&quot; She glanced at the corpses beside her and grinned wolfishly as she turned her piecing gaze back to the gnome. &quot; I suppose it would have.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her dirk suddenly flew through the air, imbedding itself through the stunned gnome’s foot and into the ground. He cried out in pain as he tried to pull the blade from his foot, not noticing as the woman he had had a bad feeling about got to her feet. With two strides she was crouching before him, her now mended hand tightening around his little throat. <br>
<br>
&quot; Your friends died quietly, painlessly, if it makes you feel better. You, on the other hand….&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>

His unseeing eyes bored into her, though she knew he could not see her. Silently, the gently breeze off the water masking her breathing, she neared her prey. Emerald eyes glimmered briefly from within the shadows before she stepped out of the dark.<br>
<br>
&quot; Elandril, just the man I was looking for.&quot;<br>
<br>
His face showed his momentary surprise before recognition of her voice registered. A smile spread across his lips as he stood straight at her approach. &quot; Tero!  Good to see you.&quot; He chuckled at his own joke. &quot; What brings ya this way?<br>
<br>
With great difficulty, Terolyn swallowed the desire to gut him where he stood and forced a smile onto her face. Speaking as pleasantly as she good she answered. &quot; Just passing through and heard you were in the area. I thought we could have a drink or two, catch up since we haven’t seen each other in a while…&quot;<br>
<br>
His smile widened. &quot; Sure, sounds good. I believe I got some Blackburrow stout-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I’ve got something better,&quot; She rummaged through her pack, retrieving the wine skin. &quot; I borrowed this from Dey’s private stash.  Doubt she will miss it.&quot; She removed the cork from the skin.<br>
<br>
Minz sniffed like an animal at the air, an impish look  in his eyes. &quot;  Um, easy there hon, that’s strong stuff.&quot; <br>
<br>
She chuckled darkly. &quot; What’s the matter? Not stomach for the good stuff?&quot;  Finding it harder to <br>
restrain herself Terolyn dug once more into her pack. The two goblets clinked against one another as she lifted them out of the sack.<br>
<br>
&quot; And glasses too,&quot; Minz snickered. &quot; Wow, to what do we owe the occasion?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes never left his face as she poured the wine into the first goblet and placed it in his hand. &quot; No occasion.&quot; She emptied the skin into the second glass, her face now as cold and emotionless as the crystal of the goblets. &quot; I just a good drink now and then, don’t you?&quot;<br>
<br>
He did not seem to notice the subtle chance in the tone of her voice and raised the glass in a toast. &quot; Cheers!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a tap of her glass to his, Terolyn smirked. &quot; To your health…&quot;<br>
<br>
The sweet smelly liquid had barely passed his lips before he lowered the glass, his eyes narrowing. He swallowed the fluid in his mouth, holding the glass beneath his nose and inhaling deeply. &quot; What’s - what the-?!&quot; The goblet fell from his hand, shattering when it hit the ground. &quot;Poison?!&quot;<br>
<br>
An annoyed growl escaped her and grabbing him before he could react she slammed him against the stone wall, her dirk suddenly pressed dangerously against his throat. &quot; It would have been easier if you had just drank the wine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; You’ll pay Tero,&quot; He face twisted into a sneer<br>
<br>
&quot; Drink!&quot; She forced the rim of her glass between his lips and began to pour the wine into his mouth. He shook his head violently, knocking the goblet from her hand.  The next instant he spat the wine in his mouth directly into her face. Alcohol burned her eyes and he punched her viciously in the abdomen, sending her stumbling back a few paces.<br>
<br>
His breathing was coming in rapid gasps, the confusion and anger apparent on his face as he drew his harpoon from his back and a dagger from the folds of his cloak. &quot; I won’t go down easily&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn wiped the moisture from her face, drawing her stiletto from her belt. &quot; More fun for me then!&quot;<br>
<br>
She ducked under a swing of his harpoon, buying time until the pit of wine he had drank took affect. The deadly dance began, the ringing of their blades echoing through the mountains. Her blades sunk into his flesh, as did his gouge into her. Terolyn crouched beneath another attack of the harpoon, but was not quick enough to move away from the slashing dagger as he moved behind her. Metal bit through her sleeves and into her arm. In the same motion he tore the blade from her, moving the shaft of his harpoon over her waist and pulling her against him, and held the bloodied dagger at her throat. &quot; Enough!&quot;<br>
<br>
Both rogues were breathing hard, but she could sense the tiring of his muscles in his weakening hold on her. &quot; What’s the matter Minz? You’re looking a little tired.&quot;<br>
<br>
He snarled. &quot; Bite me!&quot;<br>
<br>
A wolfish grin filled her features. &quot; If you insist!&quot; Terolyn took hold of the arm with the dagger in hand and sunk her teeth into his wrist. He hollered out in pain, the weapon falling from his fingers. Minz pushed her away as she laughed, spitting the salty blood from her lips. With a feral scream she spun around, the blunt end of her stiletto’s hilt cracking against Minz’s temple. <br>
<br>
A soft moan of pain and he crumpled to the ground into unconsciousness.  <br>
<br>
Emerald eyes flashed dangerously as she stood above the helpless Pendragon, the grin never fading. &quot; Nighty night, Minzy.&quot; <br>
<br>

<br>
DISCLAIMER:  This post is rather graphic, and those uncomfortable with such should not read the following story. Thank you.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The sun was just beginning to descend beneath mountains when the druid saw the woman approaching the druid ring. She was moving slowly, burdened by the man she half dragged. The druid rose quickly from resting spot beneath the shade of a tree and rushed to help her.<br>
<br>
&quot; What happened?&quot; He asked after taking in the wounds of both of them.<br>
<br>
&quot; We were ambushed by goblins,&quot; Terolyn let the druid take the semi-conscious Minz from her. She watched the druid sit Minz against the same tree he had been resting beneath and begin to examine the bloodied welt on his temple. Her fingers slipped into a hidden pocket on the inside of her cloak and brushed against the empty satchel of powder. The sedative had made it difficult to travel, but a few grains on the half-elf’s tongue, every time he showed any coherence, kept him docile enough. She had to move quickly though, for the powder was gone and the last dose would not last much longer.<br>
<br>
She took hold of the druid’s wrist as he began the healing chant. &quot; There is no time for that. We must move, now. You can heal him when we get to where we’re going.&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid looked up at her questioningly. &quot; I do not think it wise to move him any more without a healing. His injuries could be worse than they appear and we could do more harm than good.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn softened her look, appearing concerned. &quot; I know that, but it wasn’t just goblins that ambushed us.&quot; She released her grip on his wrist and knelt beside him. She looked to Minz, her hand caressing  his cheek, and her lower lip trembling as she forced tears to her eyes. She spoke in a hushed voice, pleading emerald eyes turned to the druid. &quot; I need your help. I can’t protect him here.&quot;<br>
<br>
He nodded and patted her hand reassuringly. &quot; Alright, we’ll port out right away.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Minz moaned plaintively as the two Feir’Dal lifted him to his feet. The sedative was wearing off.<br>
<br>
&quot; You’ll have to hang on to him while I open the portal,&quot; the druid said as he took a few steps back and started the incantation.<br>
<br>
She nodded, not wanting to interrupt the spell. The air around them grew heavy as the magical energies surrounded the three of them. Terolyn tightened her grip on Minz as he shifted his weight, becoming more aware of his surroundings. Her fingernails dug into the skin of his arm, and she hissed in his ear, &quot; Don’t do anything foolish, Elandril. I could make this a lot worse than it has to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
The portal fell around the three travelers, the mountains fading away into a dark wood. Letting Minz drop to the cool grass beneath her feet, she closes the distance between her and the magically spent druid. &quot; Thank you my friend, you have probably save my life.&quot; Her fingers wove into his dark hair as she pressed herself against him, her lips hovering just above his. &quot; I told you I would reward you extra for your troubles.&quot; Confused, the druid did not resist as she began to kiss him, slowly, sensually.  He did not notice as she released the dagger hidden on her wrist into her palm.<br>
<br>
Behind the two elves, Minz propped himself onto an elbow. His head spun from the after effects of the drug but he knew what was to come. &quot; She’s going to kill you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid pulled his head back, his confusion even deeper at the half-elf’s words. &quot; Wha-&quot;<br>
<br>
Terolyn looked over her shoulder at Minz, her tongue running over her lips. &quot; Now you’ve gone and ruined my fun.&quot; Fingers clenched dark hair painfully and she plunged the dagger into the druids abdomen. His eyes widened in surprise and pain. She pulled him closer to her, burying the dagger to the hilt, blood spilling onto her hand as she slowly twisted the blade inside him. His scream echoed through the forest and she laughed in delight. <br>
<br>
Holding the poor elf on his feet she pulled the dagger upward, tearing through flesh and organs until the blade came to a stop against his lowest rib. A trickle of blood flowed from his lips as his life slowly ebbed from him. Her lips pressed again his again, her tongue licking away the blood with a soft growl. <br>
<br>
She left the dagger in him as she let him fall to his knees. Holding tight to his hair she removed the scimitar from the druid’s belt and held it to his throat. &quot; I meant it when I said you probably saved my life.&quot;  With one swipe of the blade she severed the head of the druid.<br>
<br>
With the head in hand she turned back to where Minz laid as the druid’s body fell onto its side. He tried to get to his hands and knees but she drove him back to the earth with a kick to the stomach. Chuckling darkly she dropped the head into the rogue’s lap. He cried out in disgust and shoved it off him but not before the blood soaked through his clothing. <br>
<br>
Blind eyes stared up at her. &quot; What’s happened to you Terolyn?&quot;<br>
<br>
A feral snarl escaped her and she reached down and grabbed him by the collar of his tunic. &quot; You happened to me!&quot; She lifted him from the ground with surprising strength for her size and slammed him against a tree, knocking the air from his lungs. &quot; You were my friend and I trusted you!&quot; <br>
<br>
She threw him back to the ground and turned him onto his stomach. Her knee dug into his back as she pulled his arms behind him and bound them tightly. Terolyn leaned into him, her bloodied lips brushing against his ear. &quot; You may be blind, Elandril, but by the gods you will see your beating heart in my hands before you die.&quot;<br>
<br>

Something teased at the edges of his senses. He paused between the dark stone buildings, watching the men and women going about their business. This was not a city he could call home, simply one that he was accepted in, and used as a resting place between hunts. He knew it well enough to find what he needed, but many of its streets remained unfamiliar to him.<br>
<br>
Standing beside a fountain, he tilted his head as if listening for something. It was not a sound, but a feeling, something he had not felt in quite a while. He half closed his eyes as he focused himself, attuning his power to the nagging sensation.<br>
<br>
A name came to him suddenly, and a wolfish grin stretched over his thin lips. “Ahhh,” he muttered to himself, “Anari.”<br>
<br>
Khasirath realized then that one of the guards of the city was watching him a bit too closely as he stood there in meditation. Accepted he might be, but Teir`Dal were still considered outsiders here, not to be trusted. Khasirath’s eyes narrowed, his grip tightening on the grip of his lance. The guard shifted uneasily, but stayed his post.<br>
<br>
Containing that snarl that was in his heart, Khasirath turned sharply away, and walked straight to the small room he had rented for his stay. The guard did not pursue him. The Reaper’s white eyes flashed silvery with his rage. Contemptible beasts, strutting about under the banner of that filthy creature Cazic-Thule, certain of their vaunted ‘superiority’. One day, and soon, they would be shown the power of Hate. They would be broken, and kneel before the Father after they paid for their interference.<br>
<br>
After locking the door to the small room, Khasirath laid his lance upon the narrow bed, and hung his heavy travel cloak by the door. He pulled off his gloves and unbuckled his bracers, placing them on the bed as well. From one of his packs he drew out an old box of Darkwood, its lid intricately carved with fine runes and symbols. Growling under his breath at the lack of a table or even a writing desk, he set the box down on the foot of the bed. He stilled his mind, and softly incanted a prayer in the Elder Teir’Dal as he opened the box, and lifted out the shallow bowl of Adamantite that had been imbued with Innoruuk’s blessing. Setting the bowl on the bed he drew a slim imbued Adamantite knife from it’s Koada`Dal leather sheath which was built into the lid of the box.<br>
<br>
Khasirath knelt beside the bed, and closed his eyes as he sank deep into prayer. As the Father’s Hate filled him, he focused it upon his bond with Anari, the link forged in blood and pain and the dark gifts of Innoruuk. Almost whispering the mantras of Hate, he opened his eyes once more, and lifted his arm above the bowl. He drew the keen edged blade deep across his wrist, across innumerable other scars from ceremonies and rituals of the past. His blood ran into the bowl, thick and hot, filling it halfway before he moved his arm away. He brought his wrist to his lips, licking along the cut to clean the blood away.<br>
<br>
Setting the blade beside the bowl, Khasirath stared into the depths of the blood, maintaining the clarity of Hate within him, and the bond with Anari. He was no Prophet, no scryer, but with the right tools and the Father’s Will, sometimes he was able to grasp a bit of insight.<br>
<br>
A long time passed, the thready sense of Anari’s presence mingling with the Reaper’s prayers and Innoruuk’s Hate. Khasirath’s breathing was slow and deep as he stared within the bowl, and the sensations became clearer. He could feel Anari’s hate, stronger than he had ever felt it before, and almost taste the vengeance-lust that filled her. Khasirath controlled the urge to smile at this, maintaining his control.<br>
<br>
An ache began, deep behind his eyes, within the scarred sockets. He refused to let it distract him. Resolutely he remained, watching the bowl, praying. The ache increased slowly, growing to a throbbing pain that stabbed in time with the slow beat of his heart. A slight hiss escaped him, but he did not falter.<br>
<br>
And then the vision came, not from the depths of the bowl, but from inside his eyes, the new eyes his Lord had given him. The still surface of the blood was merely a background on which the vision rested.<br>
<br>
Khasirath saw, as if from Anari’s own sight, the crumpled form of the Dragon’s blind Jester. Within himself he felt the utter madness of unbridled hate in her heart as she looked upon the mongrel Rogue. Like whispers in his mind he heard her plans for Minz, and the smile did come to his lips then.<br>
<br>
The vision was brief, only a flash of sight really. Suddenly the pain behind Khasirath’s eyes twisted like a jagged knife into his brain, and he gritted his teeth hard to keep from crying out. His sight flashed deepest blood red, and then all to black.<br>
<br>
The power of Innoruuk’s hate within him receded as a tide, and Khasirath reached forward carefully, grasping the edges of the bowl. He lifted it slowly to his lips, and drank the cooling blood. Softly he muttered one last prayer as he set the bowl back down.<br>
<br>
Unsteadily Khasirath stood, holding onto the edge of the bed. He sat down at the head of the bed, his breath faster, struggling for control. Squeezing his eyes shut he focused on the hate within him, and waited. His breathing stilled once more, his heart stopped its racing. A long while he sat, before opening his eyes.<br>
<br>
At first all he saw were shadows, vague outlines of the bed and the walls, the darkness of his cloak on the wall. But steadily his vision cleared and returned. Within a few minutes all was well.<br>
<br>
He stood once more, and carefully cleaned the bowl and blade before returning them to the box. He put it back into his bag, and clasped his cloak around his shoulders. Lifting up his lance, he left the room once more, locking the door behind him. In the hall he called upon the shadows, cloaking himself within their magic.<br>
<br>
The sense of Anari’s presence was much clearer now, and as he walked the streets he concentrated on it, letting it guide his wanderings until he came to a large dark house. Finding a quiet spot he watched and waited. The house in some small ways made him think for a moment of home. Of course, it could not truly compare to the manse of House S`Therik, but an aura of power and dignity not unfamiliar seemed to linger about it.<br>
<br>
He doubted it would be an easy place to enter, but with patience, an opportunity would come. And as an elder race, patience was something the Reaper of the Violent Harvest had to spare.<br>
