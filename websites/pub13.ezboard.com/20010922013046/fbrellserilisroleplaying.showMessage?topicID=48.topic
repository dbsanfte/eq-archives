<br>
In the distance I could hear the yelping growl of a young Gnoll as it found another a victim to pounce... a young barbarian maiden sent out into this cruel unforgiving valley to prove her worth to her clan.  I could not pass<br>
by and leave her to her fate...<br>
I closed my eyes for a moment, calling the power from within.  Droplets of energy oozed from the pores of my skin, dripping from my fingers and striking the snow covered ground, causing steam to rise where they fell.<br>
<br>
I sent forth the pneuma of soulfire toward the gnashing abomination resembling man and beast.  For a moment it's body outline was clear in the green-orange fire that enveloped it.  All too sudden, the natural quiet noises of the night returned.  All that remained of the Gnoll pup was some charred flesh, still smoking in the aftermath.<br>
<br>
I did not linger.  I made a cursory check of the girl - she was shaken badly, but otherwise not harmed beyond a few scratches.  I wended my way on through the almost invisible, snow laden trail.  My destination:  the ice<br>
Orc camp bordering the Permafrost Tundra...<br>
There I would find my Friend and brother in the arcane arts, Odaan Windweaver.  An Enchanter of great talent and trusted ally, we made a pact to hunt together whenever possible...the aim, to obtain the strength to<br>
wield the ever growing powers we each command.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the destination, I found myself among strangers - other hunters and adventurers of differing abilities. I waited...<br>
After some time I decided to leave, knowing I would find my friend in other, more temperate regions of Norrath.  I summoned the energies and wove the dimensional bell that would transport me to the grand city of Qeynos.<br>
For as long as I can remember, the displacing, dizzy effect induced by the shift always surprises me; I will never get quite used to that.I opened my eyes and saw before me the massive stone structure of the entrance to the city - its portcullis had been removed as a sign of faith in all who entered by a long dead king.  <br>
The guards standing outside the entrance registered my appearance with hardly a nod of recognition.  I greeted them as I passed the threshold of the archway leading into the city.  I soon found the shop I sought:  &quot;The Jewelry Box&quot;.  Here I would buy the gems that I sorely needed for my<br>
workings of magic.  It was then I received the thought, sent to me by Odaan, carried on the wings of magic, &quot;I stand in the lands of the Karanas...come, quickly, to the south of the karana river...an evil unknown has turned the<br>
bird people.  We have no choice but t to destroy them, for the evil is too deep in their beings.  Come and join me in this battle...&quot; The thought faded from my mind, but it's meaning and portent remained etched clearly in my mind's eye.  With grim determination I set out with utmost haste to the Karanas, lands of many dangers...some known...others only dreamed, but equally deadly.<br>
&quot;How could the evil taint reach so far so soon?&quot; I asked myself as I ran, using the magical enhancements of my trade to avoid suffering any weariness from the trek.<br>
Like bubbles in a cloudy pool of water, these nodules of evil continue to accost the vast lands of Norrath, never so much as a warning of their coming.  The source would be discovered.  Then it would be a question of whether all who rallied to the fight would be strong enough to turn it back...this much I hoped.<br>
<br>
The day wore on, and as night drew closer, I started looking for a suitable place to rest for the night.  I found an abandoned farmhouse.  With the encroaching sound of thunder I found the door and entered. Inside I found other travelers, merrily talking to each other sharing news<br>
of their travels.  Nodding to some of them,  I found an empty corner of the room and sat down.  I drew from the flask I carried some water and apiece of bread. Summoning a small tendril of energy, I converted the bread into meat and the water into a diluted honey mead.  Taking still another piece of bread, I ate my meal in silence as I listened to the banter of the others.<br>
The evil that had fallen on the birdmen of South Karana troubled me.  Further south of the birdmen lay another land, the &quot;Land of Unrest&quot;.  A place long ago cursed by dreaded forces.  A place where magic wielding Gnolls are<br>
proliferate.  It was there I would begin my investigations...perhaps I would be lucky and find key clues of this newfound bane of evil.<br>
<br>
Finishing my meal, I gathered myself and, closing my eyes, meditated.  Moments later, my mind tranquil, I sent Odaan a Thought, &quot;...I come, Brother.  I am still in the west Karanas, and will be with you come the late day of tomorrow...&quot;<br>
<br>
I finished my meditation.  Though my mind was refreshed, I still needed to allow my body time to recover from this leg of the journey.  Gathering some of the strewn hay from the floor I fashioned a cushion for head and, lying upon it, I quickly fell asleep to the far off howls of a pack of wolves on the hunt, and the growl of a bear stating his territory.  My last waking thoughts returned to the  birdmen, once a proud peaceful race, turned and twisted by<br>
evil with no hope of salvation...a sad business indeed.<br>
