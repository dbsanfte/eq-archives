<br>
the 10$ argument just doesn't stick.<br>
<br>
1 Indy = 10$ = right for 1 raid<br>
60 People Guild = 600$ = right for 1 raid<br>
<br>
so keep on arguing like this, you just push FCFS.<br>
the sign up boards will be no longer, when the first big guild starts to think logically and do the same calculation I did.<br>
<br>
equal rights means 1 account = 1 raid ==&gt; 60 accounts = 60 raids<br>
<br>
or ... the better solution ... FCFS<br>
<br>
This is my personal opinion<br>

Sounds like you hold an unpopular opinion about the Brell reservation system(you want FCFS) and this must be frustrating for you to see rotation lists.  A suggestion: push your agenda in another thread if you wish to get some traction with it.  <br>

<br>
Its also been brought up on MANY other threads about Indies.  The logic is flawed.  If non-guilded players have rights just because they pay $10 a month then EVERYONE has those rights, guilded or non-guilded.  Obviously we dont want a guild of 40 having 40 slots so they are restricted in order to have a system that attempts to be as fair as possible to everyone.  Why should guildmembers be restricted and not non-guildmembers in order to have a system that attempts to be as fair as possible to everyone?  Why should a guild of 40 be given one spot yet 40 indies can have 40 spots? Why should 3 guilds of 10 get 3 slots while 1 guild of 30 gets 1 slot?<br>
<br>
Most of the guilds on the Vox/Naggy lists are on their 2nd or 3rd or more shot at Vox/Naggy.  I say remove the dragons from the rotations.  They would die alot faster and those that want to put the effort in would get the reward.<br>

It is not as you state above a case of <br>
<br>
1 Indy = 10$ = right for 1 raid<br>
60 People Guild = 600$ = right for 1 raid<br>
<br>
It is infact<br>
<br>
1 Indy = $10 x 60 others people on the raid, from various backgrounds = $600= right for 1 raid<br>
<br>
60 People Guild = 600$ = right for 1 raid<br>
<br>
IE $600guild picked raiders=$600indy picked raiders, the only actual difference is one of WHO gets to do the picking. X number of raiders still go to Z raid slots, be they indy or guild.<br>
<br>
The real problem that needs to be addressed is this situation where guilds count as one player for bookings and yet various indies can theoretically act as a pseudo guild inviteing each other but avoiding the above booking restriction. That is what needs solveing. This inequity will not be fixed by swinging hard the other way with an even greater inequity.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is we are talking about a limited resource with a large demand, There are only two alternatives in these types of situations, either everyone has an equal opurtunity to the resource by even division or you deny some portion (disorganised minorities are popular favourites here) access to the resource in order to increase another groups &quot;wealth&quot;. This later case is what the &quot;ban indies&quot; idea  is promoteing, This is not a good solution, it will lead to major trouble. Take a look at any historical revolution if you dont believe me.<br>
<br>
The answer is to be found in the equal share, however we arent quite there with what we have now.<br>
<br>
On a different but related note, the last indy raid I attended there where a large number of guilded people present. Remember Guild_member_00 is not limited to attending only guild raids, unless THEY CHOOSE to be so limited, in which case I think its a bit rich to be useing this argument that poor old guildXX has to wait months etc etc. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uabraxax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abraxax</A> at: 5/30/01 5:13:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushyntlara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shyntlara</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www2.xpressweb.com/spektral/images/shyntS.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/30/01 5:34:08 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www2.xpressweb.com/spektral/images/shynt.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Indies on Dragon Rotations</span><hr size=1> The isue here isn't rights its power... <br>
where is the power on brell consolidated? lot of people say the power is in the big guilds, ie the argument taht lil guilds are destroyed as the members reach 45 and want the big guild suport. the players are &quot;giving power&quot; to the uber guilds.  If ya got a gripe with this simply type /guildrmove aver you target yourself.  even so that percieved power is a total illusion.  <br>
   House Kenafin was tore up from the indside out every time it got big becuase i wouldnt host raids.  Raids are expensive clerics peridots etc rocks for alter plane and so forth.  Nowhere in Kenafins charter did it ever say anything about raiding.  I wrote the charter i remember it its about family.  Now if you want to go on a raid its fairly simple you ask the guild or indy if they'll let you go with them they say yes or no based on your raiding experiance and reputation.  I'm voting yes because i dont beilive on treading on anyones rights but lets face it the likelyhood of indy's soaking up massive amount of raid time on brell is not very high.  another thing the sign up is only subjective,, people think you must sign up to go. Got news for you 5 vox raids 3 naggy raids 39 hate raids 15 fear raids 12 sky raids two track raids 8 growth raids, i think,, guess what? i have never signed up for any raid.  I ask can i go they say yes or no i bust my tail do my job apearently some people think i'm an ok cleric and i get buged alot to go on raids.  Ya can ban indy's from hosting a raid it wont change i thing there will be indy's on raids regardless.  Skyre and Silent Redemption arent so big that they'll exclude indys from going with they just arent like that. This is a aurgument about power and the truth is power lies in the hands that reach for it. House Kenafin is a little guild but it's matron has a big mouth and i'm heard all across brell be that good or bad. Cast your vote it democratic and the polls will come up with a decision that will be forgotten almost imeadiatly. but dont boo hoo the uber guilds or the indy's cuase its a pointless conflict.  The individual player will raid or they wont raid and no one is going to stop them from doing so except for themselves.<br>

the flaws in your post are:<br>
<br>
1. You cannot even write my name right, which is a crime, lol.<br>
<br>
2. You have no idea of what fairness is, it seems.<br>
<br>
60 indys can post 60 raids, thats a fact and noone can stop them.<br>
60 people in the same guild can post 1 raid only.<br>
thats where the injustice lies, and the system IS abused that way.<br>
<br>
these are facts, do something about it, or FCFS is very near.<br>

You are making it seem like joe indy is going to be on 60 dragon raids because 60 different indies have slots. Noone stops members from other guilds signing up for raids guilded or otherwise, alot of people from guilds have far far better shots at getting on an indie raid then they do another guilds raid. <br>
<br>
For example Skyre draneth, silent redemption, watchers, Europa tribes. These are 4 guilds that need very little help i would say in accomplishing most of the tasks they wish to do, thus an indie raider is far far less likely to be able to join them on a given raid. ( and yes i know these are not guilds that raid nag or vox anymore, but the idea still holds). <br>
<br>
Joe indie however runs raid x he will need help and you cant assume he is taking 59 other indie people who all only invite each other. That means that there will be representatives from guilds present (in fact i would be willing to bet even on indie raids that a majority of the raiders present are guilded people). So let indie's sign up and dont tell them they HAVE to join a guild just for the privelege to go on dragon raids, noone is stopping you from signing up for indie raids and you have a far far better shot of going on his then he does on yours. <p>Talliinn<br>

Again, I don't understand why Sstiyrr is suggesting that 60 indies are trying and succeeding at abusing the current rotation lists.  This is just hyperbole.  Here is the current rotation list for Trak:<br>
<br>
Watchers (Shaft)<br>
Elysian (Solkain)<br>
Skyre Dranneth (Elkanir)<br>
Silent Redemption (Tanix)<br>
Abyss (Aislinn)<br>
Enshadowed (Tarskin)<br>
Clan Spiritslammer (Chants)<br>
Legion of Heroes (Benni)<br>
Sojourners<br>
Europa Tribes<br>
Spiritual Tides (Ranaman)<br>
Order of Eternity (Utope)<br>
<br>
As you can see, Sstiyrr - not one indi is on the list.  I think your agenda, whatever it is, is taxing this discussion.<br>

Now, being an independent and signing up on another guilds raid means there's a good chance I wont be going on the raid.  In a fair world this would balance out guild members only having one representative on the raid list, as that when they go everyone in that guild will go.  As an indy, you could plan on leading a raid, but you a) might not get enough experienced people b) you might not know what your doing or the leader might not...so my point is there is bonuses to both sides.  I know it might be abused, but I really dont want my option to lead a raid to be negated because I am not in a guild.<br>

If you are more interested in nitpicking details than the matter at hand then try this.<br>
<br>
1: I am able to &quot;write&quot; you name, what I didnt do was &quot;spell&quot; it correctly. How's that for stupid semantics? Do you find it irrelevant and irritateingly petty suggesting a weak argument? I do. <br>
<br>
2: Rather than attempt a serious reply to what was said you take the lazy option of making a groundless accusation that I dont know what fairness is, puulease! We are debating an issue here, not you, me or your english teachers level of skill. <br>
<br>
 Claiming the moral high ground as a justification for your ideas didnt work for the flat earth society and it isnt working for you. To add weight to your vaporous point you then ...repeat it. Repeating your point does not make it any more accurate than it wasn't to begin with. What it does do is make you sound like a stuck record unable to think beyond your own initial ideas.<br>
<br>
Maybe you like repetition?<br>
Maybe you like repetition?<br>
Maybe you like repetition?<br>
<br>
In which case you may recognise this, repeated from an earlier post for your repeat reading pleasure. It was after all posted as a rebuttal of your own ideas. <br>
<br>
&quot;The real problem that needs to be addressed is this situation where guilds count as one player for bookings and yet various indies can theoretically act as a pseudo guild inviteing each other but avoiding the above booking restriction. THAT IS WHAT NEEDS SOLVING. This inequity will not be fixed by swinging hard the other way with an even greater inequity.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are two points here, the first acknowledges the same problem you yourself do. <br>
<br>
The second point is where we differ. Last I checked two wrongs still dont make a right. Your solution is to simply penalise the indies, screw em, too bad for them eh.<br>
let me ask the proponents of this brilliant solution this, how long did it take you to come up with the idea? 1 second? less? <br>
<br>
I dont have an answer to this problem .....yet. Given thought and a bit of time and focussed debate however I suspect WE the community here may be able to. Making do with the first idea that pops into your head (IE ban the indies) is pitifull, it is an injustice and an insult.<br>
<br>
<br>
Either make an effort and have a go at a &quot;fair&quot; solution or shut up. This of course would mean you run the risk of having your idea critised,modified or even ridiculed, it may even no longer appear to be your idea (o the poor bruised ego's, I can hear sad violins playing) <br>
<br>
but there is one thing that definately isnt needed and thats the &quot;I told you so&quot; flat earther standing on the sidlines waving a &quot;FCFS flat earth&quot; placard and chanting there dogma over and over, confident in the knowledge that they are right, because after all, they said so. It does nothing to move us toward a solution. It isnt usefull. <br>
<br>
Im eager to participate in a debate working toward a solution, I will not be drawn into any other.<br>

<br>
you spelled my name wrong again.<br>
<br>
The only enforcable solution is FCFS, cause its the only way supported by Verant.<br>
There is not only the Indy problem, there is also the timezone problem, which is handled very unfair on these boards.<br>
US players always deny there is a problem about timezones and cause they have a server majority, they would win every poll.<br>
I would agree with you, if the timezone problem would be solved in an equal manner as its done for indys, but we Euros and the Asians are always told to shutup. So why not go with Verants rules? Who first engages the mob gets it. Do something to give Euros and Asians a fair shot at the resources or we could soon be forced to get, what we have a right on, using another way.<br>
<br>
This is my personal opinion (though supported by many others).<br>

Lastly - how is a timezone difference preventing you from signing up for a rotation and properly disposing of the dragon?<br>
<br>
Ok - I think this thread is getting a little off-track, if not silly.  Euro's and all other time-zone minorities seem to have a big chip on their shoulder from the many hours of LFG... &lt;grin&gt; but it has nothing to do with this thread for sure!  FCFS is a valid, yet unpopular position - if you feel that way, sstiyrr, then get smart and don't broadcast your minority agenda so overtly, or you get labeled a troublemaker and nobody will respect you. This is the art of politics and negotiation.<br>
