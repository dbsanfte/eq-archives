<br>
Question #2. What exactly does CaWU mean? Does that mean that lets say a bard that is already wearing an RBB can win another, while a player that brought on his enchanter (and was the ONLY enchanter on the raid) cant roll on the RBB for the paladin he didnt play to make the raid successsful? First off the bard was most dishonorable to rol lon it knowing he had one. that was insane. second the guild hosting (who wasnt even the guild name that had the slot??) lets it happen? <br>
<br>
All i can say is i am almost going all for FFA on the dragons now. Greedy people are ruining it for others. guilds that have no right being in the rotation are having other guilds run the raids for them. then they dont even know enough to make sure they arent being exploited. (Bard with RBB rolling on another). <br>
<br>
Meanwhile my guild that can and has easily taken the dragons out has 0 dragon haste items to its name. i am starting to understand the higher frustrations. <br>
<br>
So to that bard who won the roll... hope it was worth it. Greed... Exploit and take advantage of a system thats based on good faith. anyone there could have given it to a friend, twinked or sold it like you will.<br>

<br>
question #1 alot of people simply did not know, i was one of them.<br>
<br>
question #2 there is only 1 way people will let an alt roll for an item.  That is when it has been discussed beforehand and the raiders are awere of it.  But to say (after it drops) i want on the roll for it for my alt.  Sorry then everyone will have an alt that wants it.  Now about the bard having a RBB already, if he did then he will be known for such actions.  I can niether say he did have one or not, i simply don't go around inspecting people (not on purpose atleast).<br>

The posted rules explicitly state that if a Guild disbands it forfeits its spot on the rotation.<br>
<br>
This was questionned in the appropriate raid forum (post has since been deleted), but since the mods were transitioning responsibility and few other people seemed to care, the raid leader went ahead anyway.  Yes, the raid leader did see and respond to that post.<br>
<br>
Q2. CaWU is generally considered to apply to the character present, except where an alternate agreement is reached beforehand. (agreement being between the raid organizers, the individual asking for an exception and anyone affected by that exception)<br>
<br>
Crankie, if you [b]know[/b] for sure that the winner owned an RBB and rolled on a second, feel free to name names.  Better be sure though.<br>

But to honest I can not remember if thei person had a guild tag or not when I met him on MOnday (too busy putting together my Vox raid at the time).<br>
<br>
Q2) If that is true, I am very disappointed in the person that did that.  But then again I am very disappointed in a lot of loot things that happen with dragon loot recently. <p><center>

<br>
i guess i am just disappointed in the way Brell is becoming. As to the enchanter wanting to roll on it i would have seen no issue with this if the raid leaders didnt take the time to at least do a cursory check of who had what. <br>

And people wonder why i only bring people i know and trust on my raids. heres your reason. People who go for thier own greed have no place with me. and we all trust each other enough to know we wont be cheated by loot whores.<br>

I'm sorry this happened Crankie, you're absolutely correct regarding why various guilds have become way more select regarding both their membership and who they invite to raids.  To a lesser degree, this is why you hunt xps with your friends and close comrades instead of the random weirdos that hang out at the zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I talked to people in game about this and read the posts about who was up numerous times.<br>
<br>
The original thread was deleted somehow but when Zesty posted that Swords of Valor was up for Vox, somoeposted that Sword of Valor was mostly defunct.  It was said that they were a roleplaying offshoot of Fellowship of Valor and most of the members had returned to Fellowship of Valor and could the reservation be trasferred to them.  Zesty posted that the date is not transferable and asked if they were passing to the next guild.  No one responded by Sunday morning and that is when I strated thinking of putting together the raid for Monday.  When I rechecked the boards there was a posting that they were not passing that the person that made the reservation had every intention of hosting the raid and then made a sign up for Vox for Tuesday night.  That's when I decided to go ahead and make the attempt of her on Monday if no one esle did due to her FFA/FCFS status with the patch Tuesday morning. <br>
<br>
And as far as inspecting people before they role, I can't imagine doing that.  I barely have time to loot, type up the stats, ask for everyones name who wants to roll, edit that threee times and then roll.  I think it is the person's respobility and sense of honor to not roll on something they already have and I am disgusted at the thought that they abused the system so horribly.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicophorus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicophorus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Less Talk, More Fight</span><br>  Posts: 773<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/10/01 9:17:47 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Some observations on the lesser Dragons:</span><hr size=1> Vox: 31 on rotation, 1 Indy (3% of reservations)<br>
<br>
Nagafen: 41 on rotation, 5 Indy (12% of population).  The dismantled guild which just performed the Vox raid in question is also up midway through the Nagafen rotation (should be removed?).<br>
<br>
Vox Wait (allowing for 3 raids every 2 weeks, thus being VERY generous on patches, server resets, and succesful raids) 20 weeks (4 months).  Using 1 kill per week (assuming server resets are offset by delayed raid starts) 31 weeks (7.75 months)<br>
<br>
Nagafen Wait: (optimistic formula) 28 weeks (7 months), using 1/wk formula 41 weeks (8.75 months).<br>
<br>
I'll also admit that the only reason I bothered to look is because my guild is on the bottom of both lists.  The last time I bothered to look at the lists I remember laughing at the idea of a 3 month wait.  For all intents and purposes, we're considering our reservation as something that is HIGHLY unlikely to ever come to pass (I doubt the system has 7-8 months stress load left in it), but what the hell, we're on the bandwagon.<br>

<br>
Myself if I get invited on a raid, I assume that it's legit.  I might ask the leader specifically, if I don't know them too well (though I don't tend to accept invites from unknowns), but if I was unsure enough to need to check the boards, I probably wouldn't go on it.<br>

I didn't look at the vox threads close enough to realize that I was helping to organize a raid that should not have happened.  Qain, Kestri, apparently Zesty, and myself were confused by whether the guild was still around, but either way  I was just more interested in killing a dragon, then researching to see if the claim was legit.<br>
<br>
Bards should not have been allowed to roll on the belt, but in the end, I had no say in how loot was to be divvied up.<br>

I don't think the issue is that he was a bard and rolling on it.  It was that he ALREADY HAD ONE.  So that 2nd one is going to be twink gear or most likely sold for cash. <p><table>

Crankie is 54 and above the max raid level for the dragons. on top of that its not my place to have to police people who know the rules. <br>
<br>
Thorondar- agreed. when i was learning how to raid i was not one of the mindless millions who posted to attend every raid. i went to hate with Adun, Kruunch, Combine alliance, etc 15 times before i set foot in fear. i have always known to pick the people i raid with carefully. if i dont know you or someone i trust recommends you, you aint goin. -)<br>
<br>
Plainswalker- i have always known you to be a stand up guy. i was basically trying to say that a guild that cant lead ther own raids shouldnt be led by others such as yourself. the guild shouldnt even be in the rotation. and was more irked that the guild in question posted theywere a defunt guild and lose their spot in the rotation because of it.<br>
<br>
Kestri-i wasnt refering to your FFA raid. i personally have run 2 naggy FFA raids and see no problem with making sure the damned beasts die =)<br>
<br>
Twiggie- Aye. bards have as much right to haste as the others. it was that it was his second belt. <br>
<br>
and i was not asked to be a moderator. i think this one squeeked through because Zesty had transfered out and no replacement had been made yet. with Chants in place now i dont expect it will happen again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uveldanlionsfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldan Lionsfury</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/10/01 2:47:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Questions to be answered...</span><hr size=1> Bards should not have been allowed to roll on the belt, but in the end, I had no say in how loot was to be divvied up.<br>
<br>
Sorry, that should have read...<br>
<br>
Bards should not have been allowed to roll on the belt IN THE FIRST PLACE, but in the end, I had no say in how loot was to be divvied up.<br>
<br>
By not allowing the bard to roll in the first place would have completely negated most of this.<br>
<br>
*note:  I'd like to drop the topic on bard hastes now, my opioions are mine and mine alone, apparently..there's bigger fish to fry here*<br>
<br>
All I can say is.  I'm sorry.  I read nothing that specifically stated that the raid could not be held.  Had I known that the guild was defunct, I would have stayed further away from that raid than I stay away from Barkona.  I try and protect my rep.  Veldan is nearly two years old, and I've got to say that I think I have far more friends on this server than enemies.  I feel guilty about this raid because I took a visible and active role in it.<br>
<br>
This event has really opened my eyes about how broke the old world dragons are.  I'm definitely in full support of Adun's propsed changes.  I think they will make dragon raids much more of a positive experience for everyone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uveldanlionsfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldan Lionsfury</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/10/01 2:50:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/u999ping.showPublicProfile?language=EN>999ping</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/10/01 3:57:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Questions to be answered...</span><hr size=1> Understood Crankie...

<br>
Yes, the mods are the custodians of the raid rotation but unless the raiding community is right behind them, that's a meaningless role.<br>
<br>
It happened, Vox went down, peeps won loot.  Personally I think the raid leader deserves a boot to the behind and the Guild should be removed from the Nagafen rotation <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> immediately</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but other than that it's just a lesson learned for next time.<br>
<br>
As far as Bards rolling on haste, that's for raid leaders to decide and post at signup, bearing in mind that Bards are as melee-capable as SKs or Pallys and are particularly important on Dragon raids.<br>
<br>
The issue was that the guy apparently rolled on a Dragon/God haste item when he already had one - that's a matter of personal greed and dishonour, nothing to do with class.<br>

I was the one that raised the question about the guild Swords of Valor.  I posted on the parent guild's site and mentioned it...there was a little discussion on what everyone might want to do and I even joked about going on the raid...and I was told Enrich was handling it.<br>
<br>
I didn't follow up though.  Yeah, the timing with the mod change-over let this one slip through.  Well, we learn and try harder...at least I will.  So, please accept my apologies for any ill will caused.   <br>
<br>
I still think the majority of players I've met are honorable, fun, skilled folks who want to do the right thing for all...and enjoy the game they love.  Vox and Naggy raids can be that still.  I applaud Adun/Adune for offering a pretty interesting method of access. <p>Selilya Withertouch<BR>

<br>
I reread the thing about the Bard Class in my eq book today and it says that Bards are not much above Rogues for honesty or trustworthyness. Only thing is bards sing, tell tales and deliver news where as Rogues backstab.<br>
<br>
Looks like this one Bard just backstabbed every mellee'er at the Vox raid.<br>
<br>
You guys see that Enrick is wanting back on Vox as an Indy?<br>
<br>
I guess since at the time all this was getting togather there was no Rotation Moderater that something was bound to get Fubar'ed. Since even if Enrick had declined there was no one home to pass the baton off to the next one on the list that is was just as right for him to do Vox as anyone else. I am glad there is a Mod now for the list, tho. I only wish he would clean the trash off the Dragon board so I can make sense of it.<br>
<br>
And I still want to know the name of this Bard. And, no, not you Chants, the RBB Bilker. BTW, I have a shovel on one of my mules if you need it to clean up those sign-up sections. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/krungle101/myhomepage/krunglesig.jpg" border=0></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1593.topic&start=21&stop=37>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1603.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1588.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1593.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1593.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1593.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
