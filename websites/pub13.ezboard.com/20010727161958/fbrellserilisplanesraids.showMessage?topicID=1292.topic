<br>
The topic is: Fear and Hate can you even BUY a weekend raid?<br>
<br>
Many of you debating the scheduling problems with VS probably don't care too much about what's going on in Hate and Fear lately.  Most of you have guilds large enugh to do these planes on weekdays without breaking a sweat.  You experience and manpower allow you to clear these zones on a weeknight.  But...<br>
<br>
For those of us with families and jobs, we don't have a lot of time to join these raids on the weekdays.  I used to lead raids to both planes.  I used to lead them on weekdays also, but I have a daughter now, and must meet that obligation first.  Now that my new cleric is up to planes capable, I'd really like to clear Fear and kill Cazic.  I'd like to slay Inny again also, but I can only do these things on the weekends.  So I am going to point out the problem, and how I think the solution should be handled.<br>
<br>
Problem:<br>
I went through the raid calendar from the beginning of September through what is currently put up for February.  Thats 23 weekends.  I totaled up all of the reservations from each guild for both Fear and Hate, for all three days (Fri, Sat, and Sun).  Here are the totals for those having more than 2 weekend dates in this 23 week period.<br>
<br>
10 Clan Spiritslammer<br>
9  Combine Alliance<br>
8  The Burning Shield<br>
6  Harpers<br>
6  Lost Adventurers<br>
6  Skyre Draneth<br>
5  Art of War<br>
4  Quorum Angeles<br>
4  Warriors of Wrath<br>
4  Watchers<br>
3  Abyss<br>
3  Crimson Rebellion<br>
3  Blood Inferno<br>
3  Europa Tribes<br>
3  Exile<br>
3  Grand Norrathanian Vanguard<br>
3  Shields of Light<br>
3  Will to Power<br>
<br>
Now, this is not meant as a slam on any of these guilds.  Take no offense please.  The point of this is to show that several groups of people are leading raids on weekends commonly while others (35 other groups) only raid the planes on the weekends once in a while.  Now don't get me wrong, 3 times in 23 weeks isn't that bad, but when you get to raid a plane on the weekend every other week you have to be a good board camper.<br>
<br>
This needs to get fixed.  Others need to get their chances at raiding on weekends.  Basing your ability to raid Hate on a Saturday shouldn't require you to stay up until 3am timing your post exactly so that it is posted at 12:00am PST (or within seconds).<br>
<br>
This is only going to get worse.  We have a huge population of people in the 46-55 range, and it is growing every day.  We need to spread this out a little bit.  We are a sharing server, and will always be one.<br>
<br>
Griner's proposal:<br>
<br>
I don't like it, and neither do you, but we should set Fri/Sat/Sun raids on Fear and Hate to have lists.  If you want to host a raid on one fo these two planes, you should submit your name to the already created list forum including your preference for day.  Example:<br>
<br>
Hate, Order of Eternity, Sat/Sun/Fri  (Meaning we want to raid hate on a weekend and we prefer Saturday, but Sunday, or Friday is acceptable)<br>
<br>
There, your name will be kept (much like the dragon lists) until your time has come.  Three weeks prior to the weekend that is in question, the first person on the list is placed onto the day they requested as preferred.  The second on the list is put into the day available according to their preference, etc.<br>
<br>
These lists will move fast because every week 3 reservations will be removed.  It will not take vast amounts of time for the moderator of the lists.<br>
<br>
Many people out there are going to say that this is not important.  That's fine, everyone has their opinion.  If you aren't raiding the planes as much anymore, or not trying to get your armor anymore because you have it all, then it really doesn't concern you.  <br>
<br>
The excuse that it doesn't matter because there is better armor out there is bunk, its not an excuse.  Show me armor that is better that a level 46-50 player is going to get, and I'll skip the planes and go there.  Its doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
This topic may be brushed off, or ignored, because there are so many more important thigns for many of you to consider (like whether or not to keep the Velious 53+ zones and mobs FCFS or worrying about how unfair it is that you ahve to wait for months to kill VS).  <br>
<br>
I'm just trying to do my part.  Bring something to the attention of the decision-makers. <p>Peace,<BR>

There are alot of raids that go on in Fear as well as Hate. With all the people there I would be willing to bet the weekends are great for over 50% of these people. Kr has signed up for two raids on the weekends. This was not just a fluke. We want our members to be able to attend so we try for the best time that we can. With how many guilds raid the planes it will be nearly impossible to avoid board camping =o(. A 9 month list to raid hate of fear on a weekend will not go over well.<br>

<br>
So we should go to a super list system or better yet, given a couple more hours of this topic being up, FCFS(5 bucks thats the escalation of this post) because maybe a few players can't do the baby sitter thing or maybe talk to thier spouse about giving them some quality EQ time.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I don't see that as fair to the rest of us. Especially those of us that go out of our way to bring extras up.<br>
<br>
Now I hate to quote Verant but as they've said oh about a billion times in regards to pops of special mobs, &quot;Players that do not invest as much time into the game of course will be at a disadvantage in regards to camping these special encounters and obtaining loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry your schedules packed so's mine but I make do with what I have try doing the same.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs to stop trying to reinvent the damn wheel not a slam at you Griner but too many people coming out of the woodwork now trying to advocate a system to suit a minority group of some type or another. <br>

With the amount of plane raids hosted now it makes sense (keeping the one raid sign up per rotation in place).<br>
<br>
I disagree with your assertion that there is as big a problem as you claim, and here's why:<br>
<br>
Your list neglects to mention that that's for Fear, Hate and Sky.<br>
<br>
Your list neglects to mention that we've done ONE weekend raid in the past 2 months.<br>
<br>
Your list neglects to mention that except for our past Hate raid, all our sign ups have been mid-day or in the evening (boards being camped is one reason we don't sign up anymore).<br>
<br>
Your list shows basically all the active guilds that have been raiding the planes since September, excluding virtually no one.<br>
<br>
Your list neglects to mention that like you, we are 80% made up of people who are married and with children. 100% of us have careers and social lives. Weekday planar raids just aren't possible for us anymore (it takes us 5 to 7 hours to clear a plane, longer if a God is up).<br>
<br>
Making the weekends for the planes to be put on a Nagafen/Vox rotation would be the absolute worse thing you could do at this point. It would only add to the problem over crowding creates, not detract from it. The reason the dragons are on that style of rotation is because they're a weekly spawn, not a daily one. Big difference.<br>
<br>
I DO think that we're ready to move to a 3 week reservation instead of our two week one.<br>
