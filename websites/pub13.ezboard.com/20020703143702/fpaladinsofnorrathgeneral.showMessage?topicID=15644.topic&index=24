What exactly does that mean?<br>

We can do things nobody else can.  And we can do things everyone else can.  I think we are finally getting into the niche where other classes envy us.  3 years it took, but it finally happened.  Paladins could quite probably be the most most powerfull class in the game.   <p>Leifelf <BR>

<br>
A paladin definately comes to maturity through aa tho.<br>
<br>
But, to anyone who says AA doesnt matter /chuckle. Its a large improvement; mabye not as big as the level cap being raised to 60, and certainly takes more work to grind the points then those 10 levels took; much much much more. But, its a large improvment for a large ammount of work. A full AAed player would straight up own a 0 aa player with identical equipment; it would be no contest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvaladeer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valadeer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/23/02 4:35:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15644.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It doesnt matter</span><hr size=1> Someone said in a previous post they feel sad for clerics and warriors.  Don't, for the simple fact those are the 2 classes you will see requested above all for the most part on Larger mobs.  When you get to end game Velious and Luclin, People aren't gonna have a Pally/SK tank with a Shaman/Druid healer, they are gonna have a cleric/warrior combo with supporting classes filling just that, a supporting role.  Paladins are hybrids but in the general class of raids we are a support role.  We can fill the role of MT or MA in exp groups or on lesser "raids" but will never fill the role of a warrior.  Thats why I hate reading post from people asking for a Defensive discipline for Paladins.  I personnally don't wanna be in the same classification as a warrior, I enjoy the role I fill now.  I think one of our biggest benefactors is the fact that we have a Rezz line of spells.  Something sometimes looked over,  Wipeouts can be saved a lot more often if a Paladin camps out when all clerics are dead, or if a Necro FD's <provided he has an essencce stone>.   Top that off with Healing, BMB, and the ability to get aggro almost instantly off a caster who isn't running and you pretty much show our role on Raids and such.  <br>
Those that use our skills and disc and judge what needs to be changed from a EXP group or soloing point of view need to remember that VI looks at it from the point of "groups" working together.  That's the main focus of the game imo.  With what they have given us to work with others I think has smoothed out to a good soloing class and a excellent exp grouping class.  So no, I don't think we are 75% of warriors, I think we are equal.  They get Def, we get heals and buffs, They have and fill thier role and we have and fill ours.  <br>

Wave of P. and Healing get used in a group..DOH! they say..Man Pally's rock..you ever group with caster or melee in a ToV enviroment and your cleric doesn't have to worry about healing individuals do to DoT's or AoE spells? The clerics love you! Celestial healing during a battle to a naked comrad who fell after your cleric has rezzed helps a ton (cleric can then concentrate on the MT)...I'm telling you, I never got bitched at for not making a raid when my guild was doing something before Luclin..as of yesterday I was working frantically on my smithing in Qeynos and I got not 1-2-3-4 or 5 tells about how much they needed me at the Dain killings, but 6 different tells from different people saying how much they needed me..I will say that I am so stoaked to finally feel like I'm actually needed or am a helpful contributer to the raid...<br>
On a soloing note..I just got the Lance of Thuner..um..well, soloing is so easy now..with c2 or c3 (even more folks out there with it now) you can duel tank spiders np in Velks or even in FG (blast those stupid shrooms)..when I do aa now, I can easily get 2 aa pts a week without even trying that hard...<br>

<br>
Paladins have always been better soloers then warriors and clerics... arguably two of the worst soloing classes. Yet we are no where nearly as good at soloing as are shamans, druids, necros, SKs and monks. So when it comes to soloing VoM adds NOTHING to our abilities when compared to other classes. It does make it EASIER for us to solo just as a fact. But compared to warriors? Same concussion... we are better, as we were before VoM. <br>
<br>
In raid situations, VoM is useless. My guild has good enchanters, always on the job to speed people as soon as a request comes in... for both warriors and paladins. With the same speed up, warriors obviously have higher damage output. So nothing changes here either. Same conclusion... warrios are better, as they were before we got VoM.<br>
<br>
In group situations.... this is big toss up. This is where VoM makes a REAL difference. If the group has a bard or enchanter, once again VoM is useless. If the group doesn't have them.. then VoM makes a serious boost to a paladin's performance compared to a warrior. This is debatable, since for a long time, I almost never grouped without an enchanter or bard in group... but that was just me... generally speaking, for the average paladin, VoM makes the biggest difference in group type situations. <br>
<br>
So what does this all mean. What point am i driving at? The point is that VoM is all bark and no bite. Its yet ANOTHER snowjob by VI, trying to bamboozle us into thinking &quot;WOW, look what a huge improvement they just gave us! We don't suck now!&quot; While in reality VoM's benefits, while positive, are MUCH smaller then VI would like us to believe. And while I will be the first to step up and say, &quot;thank god for VoM, it makes a paladin's life a little easier,&quot; I would hope that everyone here realizes that we paladins most definately DO NOT out damage warriors now. VoM is useful, and a benefit to us, but it is also problematic it is aplicable uses, and therefor is NOT as huge a boon as you all think.  <p><b>Yvanhoe Torquilstone<br>
