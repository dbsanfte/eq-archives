<br>
With all the discussion on how to find Quillmane, this thread seems quite .. non-colorful.<br>
Had to post some pics of this magnificant creature.<br>
:)<br>
<br>
I am a 57th mage, on the final leg of completing my epic, <br>
(pretty insane for Verant to ask a non-tracker class to find this illusive creature, huh?)<br>
so I pulled out my retired 51th ranger to see if she has any luck.<br>
<br>
Anywho, here are my findings on Quillmane's whereabouts.<br>
<br>
I was stationed at Paw, the central location of SK,<br>
and was hitting Track every time it refreshed.<br>
After 6 hours, I saw a beautiful white winged form galloping at me at the South spire from the south.<br>
She was also just spawned, since she was on top of my tracking list.<br>
(dropped legs :( )<br>
<br>
Then as habit, I hit Track again, and she was again on the top of list!<br>
This time she was way east of the spires, a little south.<br>
Made a bee-line to her, she gave me a CLOAK!<br>
*Hooray!*<br>
<br>
So from this, she spawned back-to-back, in <b>different</b> spawn points.<br>
She behaves like a griffon, as she likes to move, and hover for awhile, look around, then switch direction and move again.<br>
<br>
Two days later, I was in SK again, someone yelled "White Pegasus!"<br>
I tracked her down ... this time she was WAY south east.<br>
around -5000, -2500.<br>
<br>
Also, after she was killed, "an undead cyclops" also spawned on track almost immediately.<br>
so "an undead cyclops" am definitely one of the PH.<br>
<br>
Trying to find the spawn pattern for this, i killed the undead cyclops.<br>
"a lioness" popped immediately, tracked (far from kill spot), killed<br>
"a lioness" popped immediately again!, tracked (far from kill spot), killed<br>
then I could not distinguish what the spawn is after that ...<br>
<br>
So from the above observations ...<br>
Pegasusu spawn is like the Nez and Phur wurm spawn in BW (also mage epic mobs);<br>
in which you have to keep killing the PH's which pops almost immediately, and sooner or later the named will spawn.<br>
<br>
I've also noticed that sitting at the south spire, there is always a roaming treant, and a lioness that paths right thru this and onwards.<br>
(loiness will stop and wack me :p)<br>
the treant I basically leave alone cuz of faction ...<br>
Combining with the fact that on my first Pegasus sighting .. she was south of the south spire, heading directly towards south spire ... it seems that it is on her roaming path.<br>
<br>
So add to the list, a treant, a lioness, an undead cyclops are her PH.<br>
I'm almost certain that a misty wolf, other wolves, and other rares are her PH also, minus the named shamans.<br>
(since they are super greenies and are never killed)<br>
<br>
But from a post above, she also seems to have a seperate path ..<br>
roaming between Hermit and Lake Rathe?<br>
<br>
That indicates 2 roaming paths, 2 seperate set of PH's?<br>
<br>
Oh, she also seems to spawn only during the day, 3rd time I saw her, it was at dusk.<br>
Anyone seen her at nite?<br>
<br>
Anywho, this post is getting long winded ...<br>
I'll let you guys digest these info first.<br>
:)<br>
<br>
*still very excited about seeing Quillmane*<br>

These are due east of Paw, right over the tunnel of Paw and north of the Shadowmen. Multiple spawns as well, with a length of less than 20 minutes apart have also been witnessed. <br>
<br>
One thing that I might want to suggest is that there are 3 rare spawn pathings. Once they are finished running one path and still alive they will take the next pathing (North to Central to South then back to Central to North) until despawned or killed.<br>
<br>
a) Northern (runs from the Northwest corner to the centaur village ), (with 3 spawn points NW, N and NE).<br>
b) Central (runs from just north of the shadowmen to Paw then up the central part of the zone to Vhalen then back), (with 3 spawn points; North of Shadowmen, Over Paw and East of Paw).<br>
c) Southern (runs from east of Hermit to west of the West Tower), (with 3 spawn points; East of Hermits, near Aviak village, and west of West Tower)<br>
<br>
This could explain some of the various locations that these rares are spotted, I will still note the Narra Tanith has been seen in the Northern and Central sectors (is she a once a week spawn, extremely rare, seen her 4 times, killed her twice), Synger Foxfire is primarily in the Central Sector.<br>

<br>
If you have a free dotting item, I would suggest going on a &quot;killing spree&quot; on the wandering mobs. This new tracking helps out quite a bit on range, as well. Path around killing things from the spires to the SW of the aviak village. <br>
<br>
Again, I tried that kite the aviak merchant to Paw and kill method, which seemed to work for spawning some rares, but I cannot be certain just yet on how rare these guys were. <br>

Roamers do not have several set spawn spots, but instead can spawn anywhere along the path that they roam.  I have observered this while camping several different spawns, the most notable and easily distinguishable being the Allizewasaur.  I have carefully watched the path he wanders and have observed him spawning at many different points along this path.  So my guess is that Quillmane can pop up just about anywhere on the path she wanders, which happens to be quite a large one.<br>

Ok, this was when my necro was soloing the Hill in SK to get outta hell (Treants were camped).  I saw Quilly pop about 1 hour @ THE MIDDLE SPIRE after starting there, but was fear kiting a gnoll, so I didn't risk it.  I got outta hell, then logged onto my 19 chanter who also happened to be in the same zone.  I was just wandering for a bit giving breezes, when I saw something white in the backround...Quillmane!  BUT, here is the thing, I don't know if he wandered, but I first saw him on the lonely aviak tower, the one closest to the west wall.  I didn't shout about it, I just kinda trailed behind him.  I knew I couldn't log onto my necro to do this, so I just followed him for about +5 minutes.  Well, guess where he ran?  *RIGHT NEXT TO THE SPIRES*.  He was a bit west of them, but we definately hit some SP spire brown soil.  I was amused as no one picked it up.  Then, being really tired, I just shouted, &quot;Quillmane running north from spires!&quot;  And a fuggin rush of the whole damn world shot out towards the nothingness in front of them.  He was quite over the hills and far ahead, but most peeps didn't care.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point of my story is, Quillmane doesn't always spawn at the spires.  I do believe he is very much tied to them, as he ran almost right through them.  However, if you want a good chance of getting him without being ks'ed, try running back and forth from aviak villiage to the splitpaw spires, but on the west wall.  Sure, you may miss the one that spawns at the spires, but if your lucky and Quillmane does spawn in that &quot;alley&quot;, the if you can take him, it will DEFINATELY not be KS'ed <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=deeffo>Deeffo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/11/01 7:20:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My story</span><hr size=1> We were hunting the high shammys for their heads a 37 monk me a 29 druid, and a 23 ranger.
