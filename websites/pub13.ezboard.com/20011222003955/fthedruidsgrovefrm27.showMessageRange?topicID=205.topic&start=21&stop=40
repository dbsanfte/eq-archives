Garions issue is that he's a high level Druid trying to solo with Nature spec.  Sorry, solo'ing past 35 for a Druid slows down dramtically.  Am I sad for Druids?  Not really, this is a group game in the long run (the R in RvR doesn't mean Mano on Mano), and a Nurture first, Regrowth second Druid is where the money's at, as long as they can stay alive to keep those buffs up on our Heros they're worth their weight in Mithril.<br>
<br>
Giving pets to Druids to maximize their soloability was the single most stupid class deisgn mistake made by Mythic, coming in a close second is the overall setup for a Mentalist.<br>
<br>
The Archer 'nerf' was primarly for RvR.  Any depowering of the Archers in RvR has a serious side effect of their ability to play in PvE.  To be honest, I deem any Ranger/Nightshade to be just an XP leech, as much as an Eldritch.  Will I level them up for the good of the realm?  Yes.  But do I want more then 2 of them in any 1 group?  No.<br>

<br>
Personally, to me, all that is different in PvP is that your opponent is smarter than the AI in PvE.  Humans are craftier and tends to use exploits to their advantage.  It's human vs human, brain vs brain.  <br>
<br>
Say for example, you're playing Madden 2002 on your Playstation 2 against the computer.  You might not win on the first try, but eventually you will learn the tricks that the computer is programmed to do, you use it to your benefit and to help you win.  However, if you play it against your friend, he/she is always liable to make a move you do not, and cannot expect.  I surely wouldn't expect game designers to design whole new mechanics for football so I can play Madden 2002 against my RL buddy. Whoever wins in a PvP situation is purely based on skills and strategy, not merely on a prediction of how tough you expect your opponent to be.  If you can't out wit another human it's your own lack of skill or stupidity. Why should game designers create a whole new aspect for you to play in? <p><CENTER>

I group with an archer most nights, (perma group) and he was complaining about the nerfed hit rate so we started to compare hits/misses, we seemed to have about the same ratio. He agreed that his hit rate was certainly no worse than mine ..... the way it should be. <br>

Sure, a fighter may have mastered his weapon, but I would say it's extremely unreasonable to say that a similarly-experienced scout is any less adept with his longbow. Now, consider that a scout (keeping in mind, I've only played to level 12) has, optimally, 3 shots with his bow before his target is in melee range, and that's assuming that:<br>
<br>
A) Crit hits and does close to max damage<br>
B) The second normal shot hits<br>
C) The 2 combined do enough damage to significantly slow the target down, buying the scout enough time to get off the 3rd shot.<br>
<br>
Now, once the scout is in melee, there's no comparison; the fighter has higher defense, higher attack power, and is basically superior in every way, shape, and form.<br>
<br>
So why, exactly, should a scout not be more accurate than a fighter? The scout -has- to land those few vital shots at long range, he can't just wait a second and get another chance, and even if he could, he doesn't have the defensive skills to last that long, plus, the bow is virtually useless at short range.<br>
<br>
That is why scouts -should- be more accurate: it's as much fitting for the class as it is a necessity. Either that, or we should nerf fighters: they're only allowed to swing 3 times with their specced weapon (which will cost them a little in excess of 1sp per swing), then have to take off their armor and use the weapon they're least proficient with.<br>
...and as for that argument about archers soloing reds, that's BS... there's 1 situation I know of where that's possible (rangers vs. those tree things around level 8), where I see those neo-dr00d theurgusts regularly soloing yellow and oranges without breaking a sweat, while I struggle to take a blue. If anything needs to be &quot;fixed,&quot; it's the casters in PvE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umacnat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Macnat</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hem1.passagen.se/lonnelid/english.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/01 4:24:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, once the scout is in melee, there's no comparison; the fighter has higher defense, higher attack power, and is basically superior in every way, shape, and form.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>

Not true, an equal level archer, even after patch still does equal or even more damage than a Warrior, but at least since the patch I dont have trigger happy archers agroing mobs off me so often .... but yes it still happens even when I just use my Taunt style.<br>
<br>
But if you solo all the time, tough, make friends and find a group.<br>
<br>
So you think Archers should have superior hit/miss ratio and therefore do more damage than melee classes in Melee?<br>

I cant wait to hear your reasoning why an arrow fired from 50 yards should be doing more damage than a 250str Troll hitting an Elf on the nod with a 2H Hammer? <p><A HREF="http://www.e-panaphobia.com/daoc/"><IMG SRC="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/nigel_b/kibuka.jpg">

&quot;Only problem with this statement, is the fact that DAoC lets you specialize and tailor your character quite a bit. For people who have spec'd very highly in only bows and stealth, this change has the effect of ruining their level 40+ character&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
With all due respect to any archer that did this Mythic did warn you NOT to spec your character like this.  Prior to release, in the strategy guide and every time they could think to fit it in they said the quickest way to gimp your character if  you are a 2X level class was to fullly spec only two lines (i.e. bow and stealth)  Most of the complaints that I have seen originate from archers who did exactly that.  Having melee skills at even half your level will solve most problems with handling blues.  <br>
<br>
While I understand some of your frustration with the way the matter was handled, some adjustments to the archer class were necessary.  I think they will continue to moniter the situation with regard to accuracy on oranges and below.<br>

<br>
I don't think archers should have the ability to do more damage overall, just more damage in a very short period of time. I'm not arguing from a reality standpoint, but from a gameplay standpoint. Yes, I agree that a 250-strength troll hitting an elf square in the head with a maul or the like would, realistically, do far more damage than an arrow could (bar the arrow hitting a vital organ or artery). But I'd hate to see this degenerate into a game realism thread, because if it did, it would wind up proving the same points all the others do: nothing. Face it, within game terms, gameplay adjustments have to be made to allow, for instance, a Briton Paladin able to go toe to toe with a Troll anything and have a reasonable chance for success. If you need to justify the arrow damage to yourself in real-life terms, I'm sure the argument could be made that due to the inherant accuracy of the archers, coupled with their tendancy to hit victims who are completely unaware of the archer's presence (negating any chance of dodging) have a tendancy to hit in vital areas or at least the sort of areas that would make combat difficult (yeah, that troll with the 2-hander hits HARD, but would you want to fight when someone just shot a stick tipped with a serrated broadhead arrowhead 50 yards at 200mph and had it lance the shoulder of your swinging arm?). Conversely, the argument, once again from a reality standpoint, could be made that while that 250-strength troll with the maul may hit really, really hard, he's hardly ever going to land a hit. Why? Well, no one's going to miss a troll close enough to hit them with such a close-range weapon. Second, that weapon is so slow and cumbersome, the target could see the troll's attack coming from miles away and have plenty of time to dodge. Realistically, that troll would be lucky to swing once every 10 seconds, and it'd be bloody unlikely he'd land more than a glancing blow on anything that could be described as even remotely agile.<br>
<br>
As far as grouping goes, that's bunk. It's been touted by Mythic for a LONG time that the game would be soloable. Now they're taking that away from some classes and making others all too good at it. They told us scouts are the supreme archers, then made rangers and hunters have the exact same potential witha  bow, in addition to their other abilities. They told us scouts would be great trackers, then didn't give us tracking. They told us scouts could have a climbing ability to let them get into good position for sniping, then they forgot to put a z-axis in the game.  =P So all scouts have now is stealth and the bow, which, by the way, was *supposed* to be the longest-ranged weapon in the game, until the Midtards and those tree-hugging Hibernian faerie people were given bows with the equivalent range. And now, after all that, Mythic tells us NOT to spec the bow and stealth? Think about that... essentially what they're saying is: &quot;Scouts *should* be specced to be gimped mercenaries.&quot;<br>
<br>
They designed the entire class around the bow, now they're telling us not to build our character around that. Why the hell would anyone play a scout and -not- spec the longbow? And for that matter, unless you're planning on regularly having your arse handed to you in RvR, it'd be insane to not spec stealth. That's all we have. Without those 2 skills, scouts are just second-tier fighters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udragoon412.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragoon412</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/01 10:49:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> One more thing...<br>

Vinea addressed the issue on another board, but I thought I'd reply over here, since it's little more suited to this board. That is: what to do to solve archery abuse that doesn't involve nerfing the hell out of the archers themselves.<br>
<br>
Many people seem to believe that adding more shield spells will fix the problem, but all this does is relegate crit to being a PvE tool. The archer's first shot is always going to be the most devastating, and negating it, while I can understand under certain situations would be necessary, too many of these shield/bladeturn spells in the game will see archers never using crit on the battlefield. Afterall, why wait twice as long to draw and aim a shot if no damage is going to be done, anyway?<br>
<br>
...basically the way I see it is that everyone's gotta watch their back for SOMETHING on the battlefield. Yes, archers can seem overpowered, but based on what I've seen of RvR so far (watching a friend with a level 32 scout), people are STUPID. They wear bright, obnoxious (and often tacky... people playing this game have no fashion sense AT ALL... but that's another thread...), shoot-me-in-the-head colored clothing, run around with virtually no buffs into areas that scream &quot;you're going to be ambushed,&quot; and then when they get slaughtered by a couple of much more experienced archers, whine that they're too powerful.<br>
<br>
...ironically, if a level 32 mob mopped the floor with a group of level 15 players, no one would say anything, but when a level 32 archer does it, their voices all scream &quot;Nerf&quot; in unison.<br>
<br>
Personally, I just see this whole archer-nerfing thing as the minority of the playerbase screaming really loudly for Mythic to protect them from their own stupidity. They don't want to use tactics or adapt to the strengths and weaknesses of their characters, they just want to gather en masse and (pardon the Starcraft reference) zerg the enemy to death. The majority of players seem intelligent enough to use something that could at least be resemble tactics. The majority of players are smart enough to realize that while the rock-paper-scissors concept of the game (archer beats caster, caster beats tank, tank beats archer) generally holds true, combat is far to situational to apply such a concept universally, and as with anything in life, stupidity conquers all. This isn't archers vs. everyone else, it's the tactically sound vs. the terminally dumb. A smart tank could hand a dumb archer his arse just as quickly as a smart archer would do to a dumb tank. And casters? Pfft... just playing a caster is like an unofficial admission that you aren't too bright...  =P<br>

<br>
Actually, they have always said this, it is just people did not believe them, and with all of the success that archers were having in RvR it is easy to see why. <br>
<br>
Speccing in some melee ability does not make you a &quot;gimp&quot; mercanary, it does however make you a well rounded scout, able to be useful in a variety of ways in both PvE and RvR, rather than the one trick pony that many archers now find themselves.  <br>
<br>
I am not sure just how little most archers realize speccing your bow skill from 35-50 gets you.  You don't get any higher version of critical shot. The only advantage is you get a slightly smaller damage variance on your hits.  Is it really worth it to lose all of those points, all of the other abilities you could have for that? <br>
<br>
Third, I am not sure why archers continue to fully spec stealth either.  Stealth is based on both distance and spec level.  The further away you are the lower the spec level you need to remain completely invisible.  The higher spec you go in stealth allows you to get closer to your target without becoming visible.  So the $64 question is, why do archers think they need to get so close to the target?  <br>
<br>
With 2X level in spec points you can keep a lot  of skills at 2/3 your level and be a very effective, very good archer.  <br>

Hmm, never thought of it that way... Right now with my base setup, I was going to max bow, skip celtic dual and get blades to 39...  If I were to limit both bow and blade to 39ish, I could spec up both stealth and pathfinding to about equivelant levels. (still going to skip Celtic Dual)<br>

Third, I am not sure why archers continue to fully spec stealth either. Stealth is based on both distance and spec level. The further away you are the lower the spec level you need to remain completely invisible. The higher spec you go in stealth allows you to get closer to your target without becoming visible. So the $64 question is, why do archers think they need to get so close to the target? </b><br>
<br>
Heheh, you've got it backwards... High stealth, while nice for running between targets, is really an advantage when running <I>away</I> from targets...  The higher your stealth spec, the less of a distance you need between yourself and that big ugly troll chasing after you before you can restealth...<br>

btw, I found <a href=http://forums.interealms.com/camelot/showthread.php?s=&threadid=739>this</a> thread over at the ranger glade.  the accuracy gimp was a mistake, the change to hitting targets higher level than us is not...

<br>
Also, aren't scouts getting tracking skills or something like that, later? And what ever happened to climbing? There still seem to be too many reasons to spec the longbow as highly as possible.<br>
<br>
I just can't seem to understand Mythic's stance on archery right now. It seems like it's repeatedly being nerfed (since beta), and at the rate it's going they're going to render &quot;pure&quot; archers inviable. There's already several classes that have the capability to completely negate the archer's bread and butter attack (crit), and tanks using abilities like engage give you such a low chance to hit, it's a better idea to run away and pick a different (softer) target. People seem to overlook the fact that archers only get a couple shots, and if that doesn't work, their best bet is to run like hell and hide (at least in a RvR environment... they won't survive melee against a tank unless they did HEAVY damage beforehand).<br>
<br>
You know what would be a great way to keep archers in check? Sniper-killing classes... rogues that have stealth and detection abilites comparable to bu slightly better than  the archer that can sneak up and backstab. There's the archer's nemesis. Make infiltrators and the like double as archer-killers. Give the class some cool abilities to draw more people to play it, and then step back and let the players keep the archers in check rather than nerfing the archers across the board. Didn't Mythic learn from Verant's mistakes? Nerfs are hands-down the WORST thing you can do to your playerbase. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umacnat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Macnat</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://hem1.passagen.se/lonnelid/english.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 2:03:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> I think archer damage/accuracy now is about right, certainly the archers I group with are not complaining about the damage they do, they miss a lot, but so does everyone else, and I wont even go near caster resists :)<br>

when a rather unfortunate archer friend dinged last night their spear started to proc - 100 DD 2-3 times a fight, I think that weapon is going to be his death sentence ;)<br>
<br>
I would like to see shield (and parry) block rates fixed in RvR though, currently the block rate is a fraction of what it is in PvE. This fix alone will help many classes to deal with archers without affecting archers in PvE.<br>

Dont know why I rarely see this ever mentioned in archer threads, but at least in Midgard they also get Beastcraft, and many archers I know are intending to spec this very high, having a pet and archery in RvR will be very powerful. <p><A HREF="http://www.e-panaphobia.com/daoc/"><IMG SRC="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/nigel_b/kibuka.jpg">

They're designed exclusively for RvR combat, which is about the only time you could have enough targets in 1 given area to make an attack like that practical. Given that you can't even be in RvR until level 15, it stands to reason they're at least fairly high-level skills.<br>
<br>
Macnat - <br>
You're still looking at archers like they're intended to be half-arsed tanks. No Hunter that wants to be a sniper archer is going to spec Beastcraft for the pet; it'd be pretty damn hard to hide with a pet around. I'm sure it'd be great for PvE, but more of a detriment in RvR than anything else. Besides, it's to my understanding that Hunters have melee skills that are significantly superior to Rangers and Scouts. <br>
<br>
You just seem to have this idea that archers are in dire need of bow nerfing and should elect to neglect their bow skills to build up others, which is pointless, really. There's a reason I keep bringing up the second-tier fighter argument: if archers aren't better with a bow than everyone else and can't spec it very highly and have a payoff for doing so, there's virtually no point in playing an archer over any other class capable of using a bow. In it's simplest terms, my argument is that the big draw for archer classes is archery; don't take that away from us. If we wanted to be a melee class that can use a bow, well... there's already several of those. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaurincotg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saurin CoTG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 8:36:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> I understand, at least in part your point, however, you have to realize that even with NO training in bow an archer class is better at archery than every other class.  The bow types alone are superior to anything that a melee class can use.  Above and beyond that, once you get critical shot 1, the disparity only widens from there.   Consequently, I just don't buy into the argument that if you don't fully spec your bow, you might as well play a melee class with a bow.  <br>
<br>
Archers can melee.  They can train in melee.  There is a reason they can train in melee.  Melees CANNOT train in bows. <br>
<br>
No one has suggested that archers should not highly spec their bow.  I guess there is some disagreement as to why it must be fully specced.  There is a difference <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udragoon412.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragoon412</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 10:14:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Suarin -- Point taken, however, I don't feel the difference in bow usage from (for example) a merc to a scout is as drastic as it should be. Damage wise, great. Accuracy? No way...<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that with bow spec, you can't just stand there and repeatedly fire. It takes time to fire off shots. In PvE, you get 3 if you're lucky. In RvR, you're currently the most widely hated enemy on the battlefield and your expected lifespan drops dramatically if you're found.<br>
<br>
Because of this, the reason scouts can spec melee skills is out of necessity. Mythic didn't make the bow powerful enough to kill at a range dependably (against a roughly equal target), so archers have to melee, and we aren't nearly as proficient as a dedicated tank. Conversely, a merc can fire his crossbow at a target to get a little bonus damage before the fight starts, then deliver a serious beatdown at close range. He has defensive skills, better armor, better melee skills, and in general has a much higher survivability rate if that ranged shot misses. <br>
<br>
I'm beginning to feel redundant... the short of my point, sort of an addendum to my previous post, is that archers only get a few shots, and missing 1 out of 3 shots is potentially devastating to a scout while to a melee, it's not a big deal. Archers NEED those few shots. Regardless of any correlation to the archer's basis IRL, from a gameplay standpoint, archers really should be more accurate. I don't want to seem as if I'm complaining about damage; I'm not at all, just accuracy. We've already got to cope with other class' defensive skills that are far more devastating to archers than other classes (i.e. bladeturn and engage), just let us have our accuracy back.<br>
<br>
Besides... IRL I'm into archery as a hobby, and I'm a better shot than my level 12 scout. =P You'd think the one stemming from the fantasy RPG would be a little better... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukiatek2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiatek2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 3:43:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> maybe you should agree to disagree =) starting to repeat same points =)<br>

hmm dragoon, since when did one realm become second class to another with regards to class balance between realms.  I understand your loyalty to your realm (which is probably where your statement came from), but archer classes in all three realms should be comparable in my opinion.  If not, its like saying, ok why would you even want to join a realm that has lesser classes cuz they will lose the RvR war unless they have higher numbers anyway.  <br>
<br>
Its my understanding that it was Mythic'c intent to have comparable, balanced classes throughout the realms.  Yes one class may have an advantage in one realm, with another class gaining an advantage in a diff realm to compensate-hence balance.  but i dont see this with the archers classes throughout and i dont think it should be that way throughout.  there is no compensation to give a diff realm to make up for one archer class having an advantage to balance out the realms.  archers are just too powerful for RvR period.  hence your argument that archers in Albion should be superior is flawed strictly from a game playing/setup standpoint.<br>
<br>
also, in traditional D&amp;D (basis of the RP game genre afterall), typically the ranger was the epitome of the scout/archer class.  so shouldnt they have an advantage =P  sorry just had to show my realm loyalty a bit too =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udragoon412.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragoon412</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/01 4:37:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Kiatek -<br>
<br>
First and foremost, I didn't mean to say Scouts should be the best archers, although I do personally feel that way and openly admit to having a biased opinion...<br>
<br>
Let's break it down...<br>
<br>
Rangers: Leather armor, recurve bow, cletic dual, pathfinding, stealth.<br>
<br>
Hunters: Sudded leather armor, beastcraft, spears, composite bow, stealth.<br>
<br>
Scouts: Sudded leather, longbow, stealth.<br>
<br>
(pulled these off of Allakhazam's site)<br>
<br>
Am I the only one that sees a despairity here?<br>
<br>
If hunters are more well-rounded, have a line of buffs and a pet, can melee well and are far more proficient in PvE, rangers have the capability of significantly better offense and a full line of self-buffs, why can't the scout be a little better with a bow? The only advantage scouts have over their counterparts from the other realms is that they have the option of using a race that has high dexterity and doesn't look like it was the byproduct of some modeler's crack-induced hallucination.<br>
<br>
But, the point I was arguing applies to all archers: give us  our frickin' accuracy back!!!! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udragoon412.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragoon412</A> at: 11/27/01 4:40:09 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=205.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=205.topic&start=41&stop=43>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessage?topicID=216.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessage?topicID=211.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=205.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.threadControl?topicID=205.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=205.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=205.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27>General - DAOC</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
