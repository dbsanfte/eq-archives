We all know that for the most part, there's no &quot;camp&quot; allowed in EQ, excepting named spawns, but it IS a courtesy that many players work with.<br><br>What strikes me as odd, is that while the &quot;camp check&quot; is a generally known courtesy, some folks choose to interpret someone's &quot;camp&quot; in rather unique fashions.  Allow me to provide an example, so everyone can see what I'm talking about.<br><br>The other day, in CC, a 45 Warrior and myself were &quot;camping&quot; the Geos tunnel.  As you can see, and if you've been there, a 49 Ranger and a 45 Warrior can hold this camp relatively well, with no danger of being run out, barring some fool training the queen room out, or something.  That said, it is going to be a little slower, since there's no healer in the team, so Med time will be a bit longer.  Still, the whole tunnel can and is handled quite easily.<br><br>We were moving to the bottom part again, when we passed a Druid.  The Druid was /role, so I /con her.  Red.  Hmm, that makes her 52 , meaning she'd get no exp off almost every kill.  Well, not a problem, since we did call it, and courtesy should dictate that we've got it under control.<br><br>As we work our way down, there's 2 bodies there, and the pops that should have been up by now are not, meaning someone has KS'd our tunnel.  Again, not a FORMAL breach of the &quot;rules&quot; but showing little, if any common courtesy.<br><br>We proceed to /ooc our &quot;camp&quot; explaining that we're handling it well, if not lightening fast.  We are then told that if we can't handle a camp, then we shouldn't call it.  My understanding comes clear.<br><br>Because we were getting exp from every kill, and a slightly unbalanced duo, we were not entitled to hunt here, in the &quot;farmer's&quot; mind.  Because she was able to sweep up and down this tunnel alone, slaying with great haste the spawns, and we had to take more time, we couldn't call this &quot;camp&quot;.<br><br>It's times like this I lose faith in people and their ideals.  Essentially we were being told that as opposed to us hunting great cash and OK exp, we should move on, and allow some selfish farmer to hunt these cash cows.  Never mind that we were there first, nor that our intent was similar, (yes, exp is slow there, but the cash/exp combo still makes it WELL worth the time)  She wanted to farm the cash, and all others could go to hell.<br><br>I am a recent server move, and this act truly shocked me.  I faced it a few times on the old server (Lanys) but expected this from the additional &quot;new&quot; EQ'ers there, who didn't understand or appreciate the rules the rest of us usually play by.  This was the single incident I had faced (and to date, still is) that showed me selfish, rude playstyle since coming to Prexus.  Up to this point, I was amazed at how helpful, kind and considerate folks had been.<br><br>To say we couldn't handle the camp because we had to move slower was uncalled for.  It was the words of a selfish player, who was desperately seeking a way to make US look like the ones at fault.  I was amazed to see that this person would actually make such a statement.  We were told that one spawn was up for 18 minutes before she killed it.  OK, so there's 12 or so spawns, and what she's saying, is that either you kill all 12 spawns in rapid succession, with NO downtime, or you're not entitled to the camp.<br><br>In defense of this Druid, after all the bickering was done, she did move on.  I do appreciate the mature handling of the resolution, but I was very upset and disappointed at the fact that we were given such a hard time about it all.  She could simply have stated she wasn't aware we were taking the whole tunnel or anything to let us know it was not an intentional KS.  We all know a GM wouldn't have done anything there, nor would I bother to petition such a petty issue.  The sole reason I'm posting here is to get a feel for the community and it's views on BS like this.  If this is the accepted standard, then I'll be sure to pop kills as I see fit, and no longer check to see if anyone is trying to &quot;camp&quot; a spot.<br><br>Of course, if this is an exception to the rule, as I hope it is, then courtesy will continue to be my guide and I'll do as I have been, wandering aimlessly through the overcrowded areas I know, until I find something available.<br><br>Nuff Said by me. <p><center><br> With love comes purpose, commitment and dedication.<br>Love speeds my blades, quickens my reflexes and brings us glory.<br><img src="http://www.members.accesswave.ca/~falwith/Screenshots/retiresig2.jpg"<br><br>49th Season Ranger of Tunare<br>Proud Member of Decursio<br>"Death is not to be feared, but used as incentive for more desperate and thus successful tactics."<br>*Note from Death's Perspective, Year of Savage Riposte* <br> <br><a href=http://www.accesswave.ca/~falwith>Falwith's Glade</a><br><a href="mailto:falwith@hotmail.com">Mail me<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264679 >My Gear</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usespetoxri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sespetoxri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 3:30:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> I did 44-49 almost exclusively in the Geo's tunnel.  This was, admittedly, only a little after Luclin came out and there wasn't the spawn contestation there is now.  This was also pre the changes to the trade skills which made crystal silk and velium bits so popular (or at least, very few people knew they were down there).  Back then (this wasn't THAT long ago, I know) CC was an xp zone.  There'd be a group doing the queen room, quite often one doing the spider hall, occasionally some brave souls doing the Terror Hall (they hit HARD and have lotsa hp!) and someone doing the Broken Bridge.  Anyone who hung around in CC back then would know my name simply because I was ALWAYS in Geo tunnel soloing.  <br><br>Now, in the beginning of this, lvl 44-45, I was generally grouped.  Once I hit 45-46, I started soloing.  Now, I couldn't quite do the whole tunnel so I always split it with anyone who wanted to camp there as well.  Generally I'd take the top four, and they'd get the bottom five (numbers might be off a little here).  The bottom geo's, as a rule, aren't as strong as the top geo's so this worked out pretty well.  During my downtime as a necro (relatively short), I would be waiting for my top four spawns and they'd happily be killing theirs.  If I needed help, they could come to me, and if they needed help, I'd do the same.  Further, on the odd occasion the Terror Hall folks screwed the pooch and needed an out, we could all get together and Derail the train.  <br><br>Don't know in what way this could help you, but at the very least, you know one other person who's camped them would have been understanding and tried to work something out with you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Jabbuk Qualaelay<BR> 41st Drow Shadowknight<BR>Sespetoxri Qualaelay<BR> 50th Drow Necromancer (ret.)<BR><a href="http://www.spacefem.com/blobs.shtml"><img src="http://spacefemsplanet.com/3dblobs/blobred2.gif" width="90" height="98" border="0" alt="Adopt your own useless blob!"></a><BR>Rarr!

Whether its a group sitting waiting to do reavers without a rogue or a group sitting at the seb entrance claiming discos without a healer, it is an abuse of the camping courtesy you spoke of.  This has become so common that it shouldn't surprise you if people occasionally question your camp claim.

Also if the druid came upon a spawned mob with no one in view they could very easily assume the area is not camped.  Many times a person will wait there for a short period of time to see if anyone shows up from an evac or bad pull and if no one appears then start killing the mobs.  In almost every instance I have been in talking to the person in /tells or /say handles the incident quickly and easily.  Most of the time if it is not an exp camp for them it is something to do to pass the time and is not worth fighting over.  Keep in mind also you were not KS'd, and had you petitioned it the GM would do something but not to your liking.  You would have been forced by the GM to share the camp, alternating spawns.  So you were not doing the druid a favor by not petitioning the event, you were doing yourself a favor.  That is something to keep in mind when dealing with other people, calling them ks'rs or threatening a petition may not be to your liking.  <br><br>To me it sounds like you had a run in with someone else that turned out pretty good in your favor.  If you handled the situation in game similar to the way you described it then you were lucky, personally if you call me a KS'r and threaten to petition you are very likely to be forced to share a spawn with me.  I find it a lot more annoying to have to deal with name calling and threats then simply letting the person know your intentions.  You will find people a lot more willing to leave you in peace if you are respectful to them and realize they are there to have fun just like you are.  Prexus is a very nice server, people in general are very respectful of others and deal with one another with good manners.  <br><br> <p> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25240" >Arumnus Athenstar Sorcerer</a><br><a href="http://www.prexus.com">Prexus Server</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthymiak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thymiak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/02 11:27:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> I'm not singling out you in particular, but I don't get why everyone thinks that killing one geo entitles them to the entire spawn.

Apparently this is so, but there appears to be a bit of an issue with comprehension, so I will clariy a few points.<br><br>1.  Petition was never an option.  This is not a single, named spawn, so, yes, by formal rules, any pops are open game.  I neve SAID I would petition, so the statement that IF I did, then folks would be happy to &quot;share the spawn&quot; was an attempt to belittle and thus ignored.<br><br>2.  The /ooc said absolutely nothing about KSing.  The entire issue was NOT brought to light by the pair who had &quot;calimed' the area, as may be thought by the poster of said suggestion.  A /say was used, trying at ALL times, to be diplomatic and courteous, open to the possibility of misunderstanding.  The /ooc was simply a statement of &quot;Geos camped&quot; which, oddly enough is said 4-5 times an hour in there with no reprecussions or whining about sharing the short tunnel they inhabit.<br><br>3.  If the MoBs were up for a length of time then obviously we couldn't handle the camp.  Oddly enough, &quot;handling&quot; a camp is open to interpretation in my mind.  If you are killing all the spawns, then you CAN handle the camp.  If you're sweeping through with zero downtime, then you are &quot;overkill&quot; for the camp, and thus, farming, which in itself is ok, provided it's not taken.  With zero deaths, and no fleeing from fights, I feel the camp was being &quot;handled&quot; well enough.<br><br><br>I was curious as to the overall opinions of players here, and now I have them.  For the most part, it appears that on this board, sharing the spawns in that tunnel is ok, but I truly believe if these same folks who say that were IN the tunnel and I asked if I could have the bottom 3 or 4, I'd be told, &quot;No, it's camped.&quot; and rightfully so, if you were there first.<br><br>I appreciate the response, as I now have a bit more understanding of the board and it's thoughts, if nothing else.  I faced similar issues on the Lanys board at one time, and while in no position to pass judgement here, as I've only been trolling the board a while, at least the responses here address the issue itself, where the Lanys &quot;Board whores&quot; as I call them, attack the person, ignoring the issue.<br><br>Maturity is higher here it seems, but the line of courtesy is still a tad hazy to me.  Will keep my eyes open and try to fit in. <p><center><br> With love comes purpose, commitment and dedication.<br>Love speeds my blades, quickens my reflexes and brings us glory.<br><img src="http://www.members.accesswave.ca/~falwith/Screenshots/falnew.jpg"<br><br>49th Season Ranger of Tunare<br>Proud Member of Decursio<br>"Death is not to be feared, but used as incentive for more desperate and thus successful tactics."<br>*Note from Death's Perspective, Year of Savage Riposte* <br> <br><a href=http://www.accesswave.ca/~falwith>Falwith's Glade</a><br><a href="mailto:falwith@hotmail.com">Mail me<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=264679 >My Gear</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujabnael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jabnael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/11/02 3:04:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.infinitusvindicat.com/memberpics/iv-logo60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> Druids!

Had you accused me of KS'ing, telling me my actions are BS etc I would have forced the issue.  The resolution was to your liking, but if you act towards me in that manner it will not be.  <br><br>A person will normally respond to you in a manner similar to how you approached them.  Approach them with courtesy and you will recieve courtesy, approach them with attacks and they will defend and attack back.  <br><br>As for handling the camp, to me that implies you are killing all the spawns in question shortly after they spawn barring some kind of problem.  The reason this becomes an issue is by your reasoning a group could easily handle all of upper seb, they would have frogs waiting on them when they completed thier cycle, but would be more then capable of killing them all given enough time.  This would not be fair to the other 5 groups looking for frogs to kill though.  Even more so, some groups would be able to take the entire top floor and keep up with spawn rates, leaving frogs up only long enough to pull them.  But people on prexus are courteous and allow others to hunt there, on busy days you will see up to 6 groups in upper seb, and others pulling zone in mobs to solo or duo.  <br><br> <p> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25240" >Arumnus Athenstar Sorcerer</a><br><a href="http://www.prexus.com">Prexus Server</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uarghificious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arghificious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 4:12:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cafenet.demon.co.uk/Domus/Images/Guild_Logo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> Cept when I'm in seb Arumnus :p<br><br>LONG LIVE AE! =) <p><P><center> See my crappy gear </P><P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122472"> Normal </A></P> <P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122496"> Resist Gear </A></center></P><center> Gnome Phantasmist</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujustar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Justar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 442<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/02 8:10:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.swordoffate.com/images/sigs/Justar2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> I honestly don't feel you were handling the camp well if mobs were up for 18 minutes? What's the spawn time in CC? Isn't it somewhere around 18 mins?  If mobs are left standing for a full spawn cycle, then the camp isn't being held and someone else could have killed those as they spawn and they would have respawned by time you were ready to kill them so sharing shouldn't be an issue and the camp would be able to accomodate twice as many people with almost no negative effect on you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustyrbjorn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Styrbjorn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 914<br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/02 8:35:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1290.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp Check</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Every once in a while I'll log my monk and kill a few here and there while afk, etc<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>LIES!
