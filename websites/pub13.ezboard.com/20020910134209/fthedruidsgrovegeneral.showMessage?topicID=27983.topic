------<br>
Druid <br>
Nature is a druid's ally. Druids are in tune with nature; thus, their magics are nature based, drawing from the spiritual forces of both plants and animals. Whether calling forth roots to entangle an enemy, or using nature's life-giving essence to heal themselves or others, druids are the masters and servants of Nature. The dedication necessary to become a druid is great; druids can only be found among the half elf, halfling, human and wood elf races. <br>
Druids have a love for all animals, but that does not mean all animals love druids. Although a druid will do what he or she can to avoid harming one of nature's beasts, many animals see a druid as just another source of food. This is no reflection of the piety of the druid, mind you, but rather of the simple minds of beasts. <b>Druids, like shamans, have the ability to aid others in many ways, making both desirable members in hunting parties.</b><br>

<br>
Going back over an old game guide GameSpot published after the original EQ was released, I saw this:<br>
<blockquote>Bard<br>
Bards are the jacks of all trades in Norrath. Bards have the unique ability to cast (sing) their spells during combat and fight at the same time. In addition, a bard's song does not use mana, so it is much easier to rattle off a series of spells without waiting for your mana to regenerate. That ability alone makes a bard a very versatile player, though he will never be as good a fighter as a warrior, nor will he be as proficient in spellcasting as some of the pure mage classes.<br>
<br>
Druid<br>
A Druid's connection to nature is the source of his inspiration and magic. It is through careful understanding of this connection that the druid becomes one with nature - and gains the benefit of nature's knowledge. Ever a friend to all manners of beasts and plants, none of Norrath's animals will ever lay tooth or claw upon the druid, unless it is first harmed.</blockquote><br>
Pretty vague on druids, eh? Considering there was not that much to go on, the author(s) just relied on Verant's spiel.<br>
<br>
A new game guide published after Kunark's release had this to say about druids:<br>
<blockquote>Druids are the protectors of nature. They are considered a priest class, since they, like clerics, rely on their wisdom attribute for their spell points. A druid's healing ability is second to the cleric's; however, druids have a number of other spells and abilities. Druids can attack their enemies with spells that use flames, lightning, and wind; they can bestow upon themselves and their companions damaging magic shields that deal damage to attacking monsters; and at higher levels, they can take the physical shape of a wolf or travel instantly throughout Norrath by means of teleport. Druids are quite possibly the most well-rounded and versatile characters in the game, though their versatility comes at a price: druids are much poorer fighters than warriors and have a much stricter limitation on their arsenal of weapons that include blunt weapons, such as swords and staves, and scimitars. In addition, druids can't wear metal armor - so they often have far less physical protection than a more heavily armored cleric or warrior.<br>
<br>
Bards: Bards are known as the jacks-of-all-trades in Norrath; they can create magic effects by singing, learn some of the skills of rangers and rogues, can wear heavy armor, and even put up a decent fight at lower levels. That said, bards can't fight anywhere near as well as a warrior, or take anywhere near as much punishment. However, bards have the unique ability to sing magic songs that can hinder or attack their foes or augment the abilities or heal the wounds of their entire party. These latter abilities can dramatically decrease a group's downtime - the time a group requires to recover from injuries and spent mana from its last fight. As such, many bards tend to be very social, and a competent bard makes friends easily.</blockquote><br>
<br>
EQ Stratics guide on bards (thanks Google):<br>
<blockquote>Bards, ancient music makers of lore, with names ranging from meistersingsto minstrels. In history they be folk who bring music and entertainment aswell as news to areas that rarely saw any of those three. In EverQuest theybe musicians as well as a typical jack-of-all-trades in their very broad assortment of skills.</blockquote><br>
PlanetEverQuest's old quiz series on bards:<br>
<blockquote>Quiz 11: Bards: Bards are the jack-of-all-trades of Norrath. While playing magical songs, a bard can fight, heal, charm, damage, run fast and so much more. Bards were created for grouping and make an exceptional addition to any group ... how much do you know about these traveling minstrels?</blockquote><br>
Old GameZNet (EQLizer) description of bards in its class guide:<br>
<blockquote>Bards are one of the most interesting classes in Everquest. Bards are the truest of hybrids in the game. They can dual wield and wear platemail armor, yet they can not double attack. They can use a large amount of weapons that are only available to them and mage types, yet can not not use any of the nice two handed weapons in the game. They have a wide selection of spells, yet only receive on every level. They have some thieving skills, yet are lacking perhaps the most important ones(backstab, pick pockets and poison).   They are a great assistance class with their group effect spells, yet they also have some spells which enable them to be one of the best soloing melee types. Bards are truly a jack of all trades, yet a master of none.<br>
<br>
Same old guide on druids: If there is one class in Everquest that can do it all it is certainly the druid. Druids are the masters of nature and certainly have no match in their domain. However they are also adept adventurer's indoors as well in that they can fill many different roles in a party. If your idea of a good time is being a jack of all trades then a druid is the class for you.<br>

If we are meant to be the class that fills in a group that hasn't got the specialised version then we should have all the skills at our disposal, making us the Jack of all trades.<br>
This, funnily enough, has made us overly powerful and able to do more things than was initially intended.<br>

Yoohoo, Araxx, the game guides were written for non-players and beginners. They weren't written for players.<br>
<br>
As such, a guide's purpose is to give some background information on game content, which is where those English-language cliches started appearing after Verant's own preliminary information appeared. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> (Quote from original post: I would just like to make an irrefutable statement. Players will not get bored with the game because they are able to solo at any level, to some extent)<br>
<br>
I was with you up to this point. I disagree. If everyone is able to solo at every level, even &quot;to some extent&quot;, then groups (which is what we want to encourage) would just run over encounters in the game. We provide classes designed to be able to solo. They are certainly limited in terms of where they can go, what they can do, and what they can acquire. <br>
<br>
If the ability to solo is so important to someone that they always want it to be available, they should consider finding a class that has that capability. Of course, the downside of doing that is that you are often less desirable to the group. <br>
<br>
Solo classes have to be jacks of all trades. They typically end up not doing things as well as group-oriented classes can. This has worked out quite nicely.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

  And amusingly enough at 60 druids are one of the worst solos for pure XP.  For being able to assassinate loot mobs we don't do too badly though, tied with a lot of classes, much better than a some, much worse than a couple.<br>
 <br>
  What really gets me is meleers with all their spells and procs.  Meleer_X begins to cast a spell...  Hey Mr. Warrior, please shrink me, I have mask of the hunter and can change forms but somehow I need you to cast shrink on me.  Summon arrows, bandages, shuriken, cast blind, SoW, heals, shrink, levi, invis, haste, proc slow, incapacitate, instant snare for @#%$ sakes on top of all their discs, interrupting kicks and bashs.  Of course swollen glands go to the tanks and monks first despite instant cast making it hugely useful to druids too even though we can sorta cast it *sigh*  If they're going to give all these abilities to melee they could at the very least apply huge cast time penalties to them, I mean, give me a break they double the cast time of misty and dreadlands rings for DRUID gear, but then go and give instant cast snare out.

Yeah, I guess you're right, guides are meant to, ejem, 'guide' you to decide which class to choose. :P<br>
But even Verant confessed that when they created the classes and gave them certain skills/spells they never had a clue that players would be able to do so many things with them, even kiting was a surprise, and lets not mention quadding...<br>
So I wouldn't be surprised even if they said Druids = Jack of all trades they didn't have a clue either. They were more than anything referring to the RolePlaying aspect of the class than anything else.<br>
So, despite it not being said anywhere what I as a Druid am capable of, I know I can do it almost all.<br>

I am not sure there was ever text that said "druids are the official jack of all trades" but it was implied on many levels... are bards getting any big enhancements?  If not, then perhaps druids and bards are in the same boat... who knows. <p><table border="0">

<br>
Bard songs stack with other classes no matter what.<br>
<br>
They can regen, boost clarity. heal  ect... on top of any other spells that may be in effect.<br>
<br>
They are kind of in the same boat as two bards do not stack much like two Druids do not stack well.<br>
<br>
Bards, however, can melee a little bit and have better armor. While it may be a joke as compared to true melee classes it is a bonus.<br>
<br>
Bards also, for hte most part, do not have to deal with mana so they can keep going without stopping.<br>
<br>
Six of one half a dozen of another but IMHO Bards are the true jack of all trades.<br>
<br>
Remember Bards get a slow and charm and it may not work as well as the real thing but it's better than what we have.<br>

&quot;What can't a Bard do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Port, Evac and heal when it counts.<br>
<br>
I think that is why druid has always been thought of as jack of all trades. <br>
<br>
ONLY the druid can do ALL of these:<br>
<br>
Heal fairly well<br>
Port<br>
Regen<br>
Sow<br>
Damage shield<br>
Evac<br>
HP/AC buff<br>
Str buff<br>
Cold/fire and to a lesser degree magic/poison/disease res buffs<br>
Track<br>
<br>
I think its &quot;port&quot; added to mix which really pushes them into jack of all trades land. Much of the time in smaller group things even at 56, there is nothing that I can't do unless someone dies and they need a resurrect. <p><center><BR>

What you don't understand is 2 years ago you could have done..none of this (except look like an inky).  Nor could a warrior have, or a monk.  You (melee) have obtained a slew of little things which have given you the ability to solo.  And in some instances to solo better than you'd group.<br>
<br>
All those little things add up..at least that is what everyone tells Druids. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">

<br>
The more toys one accumulates, and the higher quality the toys are, the less dependent on groups you are and the less you need certain classes. Your example used a shaman. All things being equal -- that is, a purely class basis -- shamans are more desirable in groups than druids are. You also said druids have a legitimate complaint about ports, but ports do little to increase our group desirability -- you don't use them while xping apart from going and coming and the occasional evac, and on Luclin you don't need them for going or coming at all.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27983.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=27983.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=27983.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27983.topic&index=20><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=27983.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=27983.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27983.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27983.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm31">Interface Design</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
