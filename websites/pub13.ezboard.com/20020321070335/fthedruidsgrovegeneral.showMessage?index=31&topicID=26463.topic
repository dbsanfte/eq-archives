By demanding to take spots away from people already there it is just going to piss alot of people off. Do yourself and them a favor and move to somewhere else if they were there first.<br>
<br>
**The reverse argument can also be made. If there are so few good quadding places for 55+, then why should a few be allowed to hog them just cause they got there first? Either way, someone is pissed off.<br>
<br>
Well... not exactly. EQ is, for the most part, first come first serve. If one guild gets to Vox, Tormax, Fear, etc. before another guild, they have the right to fight it/there. What he was saying, is that if quadder_01 has been quadding somewhere for an hour, and there is just enough for him, i.e. he is back to fm (or enough to deal with them) before respawn, then two people fighting there is very inneficient, lots of wasted time. So, I think he meant that he would hope most people would be polite, and even if a &quot;camp&quot; isn't called, if you show up to raptor island, and 3 or 4 people are already quadding there, it would be nice if you would go somewhere else since the people there can already kill everything pretty much non-stop, and you will be pulling away from everyone' efficiency, including your own. <br>
<br>
Quadding is not efficient if you can only quad one set every hour... might as well go group or root/dot solos if you are going to infringe on other people and cut everyone's spawns down. Does that make sense? I don't think anyone is saying you &quot;have&quot; to do this, just that it would be polite.<br>

<br>
that the first to get to the resource should be permitted to consume the resource without competion.<br>
<br>
and here we have it again... can people camp stuff?<br>
<br>
first -- <br>
<br>
i do not make a distinction between wandering spawns and static ones.  all mobs have a set number N of spawn points they can spawn from at an interval X and then move distance D over a set path.<br>
N may be from 1-total number of spawn points in zone.<br>
X may be from 0 (instant respawn) - a week or so.<br>
D may be from zero (static) to large (outdoor wandering mobs).<br>
whats the difference again? you cant call dibs on mobs if D is greater than zero? absurd.<br>
<br>
second--<br>
<br>
i truly believe anyone who does not feel that - the time honored tradition of EQ players to allow the first to make a legitimate attempt at consuming a resource should be permitted to make the attempt uncontested - is basically living in a different virtual world than the rest of us.<br>
<br>
in EQ you can camp mobs.<br>
<br>
third --<br>
<br>
quad kiting is fun.  people who quad kite can go anywhere.  fighting over resources isnt fun, but quad kiting is.  therefor quad kiters do and should be permitted to call camps in order to let the newcomers know &quot;hey, its kinda crowded here atm, why dont you go to another less contested hunting ground?&quot;<br>
<br>
theres plenty to go around, but not all in one place.  <br>
<br>
once a quad kiting area reaches a point of diminshed returns (that is, it is saturated with regard to consumers, given the amount of consumption the area can support)... when it reaches this point, then subsequent arrivals should seek out another hunting grounds... this is what considerate players do.<br>
<br>
rude ones demand you share, dipping into your exp and theirs.  but somehow the satisfaction of having &quot;not been told where they can and cant hunt thank you very much!&quot; is enough recompense for them.  sadly, there is none for the person who was forced to go from 8 spawns to 4.<br>

I can't see how a mob like that can be 'camped'.  If it lands on top of someone else there, good for them... if you want to camp this guy, go to OOT. <p>--&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Just because you are in a time zone that gives you an advantage or have no life does not entitle you to claim exclusive rights to a spawn. Being there first gives you ONE and only one iteration of the spawn, after that you need to learn to share. (no I do not care about you uber guild not inviting me on a planes etc raid.)<br>
<br>
Sharing is a good thing, if you cannot deal with not getting that ultra phat exp you need to go find some type of single player game where you can be your own private idhao. You choose to play in a multiplayer game, this does not mean you get whatever you want and everybody else can just go suck rocks until you are done.<br>
<br>
That being said, yes there are functional camps. Some just make sense due to diffuculty of acess or mob strengths. Some are phat lewt drops. Sitting on a spot claiming exclusive rights for an unending time period is both greedy and wrong.<br>
Good case in point would be something like a high level necro druid mage etc.. claiming the Frenzy camp in L Guk. yes it happens and sadly all to often. this does not make it right and if you fit that then you can well expect me to make you &quot;play nice&quot;, not just there but if you wanted to be an ass, I am quite capable of extending this to any and all future camps you might even dream of claiming.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enter the shades of gray..... Planes, ToV, and whatever similar will emerge in SoL. Breaking a plane requires a special effort and does entitle you to a pass through it with all mobs. This does not mean you have the right to claim exclusive rights to the plane for the next umpity days plus one. <br>
It does entitle you to a shot at the boss mobs without worring that some group of leet dewds will sweep in after you have spent the time and effort clearing the way for the sole purpose of taking down the boss or bosses. This places no weight on whether or no said leet crewe could have cleared their way. If they could then they can just wait and take their own turn next time.<br>
<br>
Courstesy only goes so far, just as your right to do as you wish ends when your fist meets my face( please be so kind as to accept return knuckles, feet, and assorted high velocity furniture.)<br>

<br>
On my server the othmir are pretty much camped 24/7 ..if its uncrowded ..its common to see a single druid quaddin the whole beach ....durin anythin other than LATE nite hour the ...the beach is simply loaded with peeps grindin for exp.<br>
<br>
Shamans and the druids under 58 simply root dot ..plenty of spawns for all ...then ya see the druids over 58 with fist of karana quaddin.<br>
<br>
This is fine till it gets a bit crowded ..then the fights always start.   Got a few who will already have 3 mobs in a kite ..and will RACE a druid ..or shammy who is tryin to pull the sole remainin otter to root dot ..just so he can add it to his quad<br>
<br>
Gets pretty nasty ..always does ..on a daily basis<br>
<br>
Saw somethin interesting tho recently ...<br>
<br>
most of the peeps that fight on the beach are &quot;regulars&quot; so they get to know everyone<br>
<br>
When Greedy Druid_01 comes a quaddin and things get crowded ..hes asked to switch to root dot<br>
<br>
Of course he responds in OOC with somethin childlish like fux joo...<br>
<br>
Then several peeps on the beach spring to action<br>
<br>
greedy druid_01 starts his quad ..gets em all bunched up ..then peeps on the beach ..one by one ..root his pulls<br>
<br>
<br>
of course greedy druid_01 dispells ..then his pulls are rooted again ....rinse and repeat ...the other peeps dont try to kill the mobs ..just root em ...messes up a quad really nicely<br>
<br>
of course greedy druid_01 bitches in zone ..and the whole zone tells him to root dot so that everyone has some mobs ..course greedy druid_01 doesnt agree ...hes just came into the zone ..and he has a RIGHT to quad.<br>
<br>
So he petitions and a gm eventually comes<br>
<br>
heres where its interesting<br>
<br>
GMs FROWN HEAVILY on quad kitin ...most universally detesting quad kiters ..and verants postion is generally against that of the quad kiter<br>
<br>
have seen on several occasions when greedy druids 1 2 and 3 ..complain to gm about whats goin on ..about respect for a camp..  gms dont acknowlege that you can &quot;camp&quot; an exp spawn in that fashion ..as already discussed earlier in this thread.<br>
<br>
So greedy druid_01 says that hes bein ksed ....<br>
<br>
now for they funny part<br>
<br>
gms dont see rootin mobs in a quad as ksin ...the mob has not been killed ..and theres no attempt to finish mob off.. so gm leaves .tellin greedy druid_01 theres no crime committed ..and recommends that greedy druid_01 work with other peeps in the zone to come up with some compromise<br>
<br>
Of course greedy druid_01 isnt happy and bitches ..but he doenst get his way  and since he cant quad ..and is unwillin to share  ..he leaves the zone<br>
<br>
ive seen this scenario played out MANY times on my server in multiple zones ...altho CS really comes to mind ..gms simply dont get involved in this quadkitin mess ..several laff and saying that this is a creative way to deal with the issue<br>
<br>
Not sayin that ya should root peoples quads ..but i am sayin this has definitely forced some peeps to share ..as they have no recourse (i dont do this personally but some RL friends do)<br>
<br>
Interesting and always makes for entertaining chat in OOC<br>

Now claiming exclusive ownership of a not yet spawned mob for the purpose of quadding, like any other readily accessible mob is greed. Insisting on quadding when others are trying to hunt an area with limited space and resources is as bad as those that come to an area and immediately attempt to take part of an active quad under the pretext of sharing. Insisting on root dotting spawn that are being quadded when there are other mobs available is the flip side of the coin.<br>

If a zone like CS is empty, quad-kiting can be fun.  When it is a bit crowded, I find that we can get similar output with root-dotting and that seem to cause a lot less friction with non-druids.<br>
