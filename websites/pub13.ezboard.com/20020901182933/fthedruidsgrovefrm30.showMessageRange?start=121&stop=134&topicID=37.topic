<br>
Sorry, but I refused to read all your posts because I am used to High Elven tongue.<br>
<br>
But, if the caster Balance will go like Melee balance, where Knight classes where made nearly equally good tanks as Warriors in all situations but disc. def. requirering encounters, we will see healing upgrades to Dru and maybe also Shm that will make them &quot;nearly equally good&quot; healers as Clerics in all situations but CH Chain requirering encounters.<br>
<br>
I for one, as a melee, am pretty pissed about being forced to have a Cleric (and in my low state of the game - HoT/Vindi are highest targets for me - a Enc/Shm to slow too), to wait for hours for one to get on or to be willing to join my group, and even more pissed about having to leave and search for reps for hours often times when the Cleric has to go.<br>
I want to see that EQ has 3 healer classes as it has 3 tank classes. On the other hand I want to see that EQ has 3 classes that can benefit as much as a chanter (CC, KEI and slow/haste in on char is godly as all are requiered, and I think that Shamans loose xp-group spots only to Encs).<br>
Against the targets our guild goes, we can often times go without a Warrior as MT, but take me, a Paladin in not even full HoT gear. I want to be able to do those raids with Warriors but - no offense to that class, I mean if you're simply not on or cannot come to raid for whatever reasons - not Clerics for example (though people will mourn about the 6% xp loss if they have to take Paladin rezzes).<br>
I can start a not uber raid without any Druid, Shaman, Bard, Necro, Mage, etc., but not without Cleric, at least one Enchanter. Any tank on is enough, add a few dmg dealers and the raid is a go. That is plain wrong!<br>

<br>
I believe the original comment about shamans twiddling their thumbs was based on unslowable mobs. If a mob is unslowable, a shaman can't do much to it beyond cripple. Enchanters can cast that spell too. Mages can mala. Shamans can still buff, and those buffs will always be needed so I don't see it is that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
Druids have better direct heals than shamans do, so I'm not sure how shamans outheal anyone but clerics on raids. It isn't canni, mages lay out tons of modrods in nifty patterns, which basically eliminates the canni advantage during raids. Torpor can only be cast in group, and no, it doesn't stack. It's a very nice heal for casters in the group, but that is the limit of its functionality on raids. Shamans generally don't heal melee on raids. Clerics or druids do. Shamans are much less flexible healers than druids are, and heal much slower. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying shamans don't have a very defined role on raids, but to say that they can raid heal better than druids I think is wrong. I also don't think shamans stack on raids nearly as well as druids do. My wife's job on raids is to shrink people getting CoHed in and to heal the modding CoH mage. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

While I do like reading your posts Graal, and I do think you have valid points, that statement is incorrect.<br>
<br>
Druids and Shaman get the exact same healing spells at the same exact levels until level 60. Where Shaman get an incredibly awesome heal (albiet, rare/expensive) and Druids get Chloroblast x2. <br>
<br>
Natures Touch.<br>
Heals 978 for 400 mana 5.5 cast time and 2.5 recast<br>
<br>
Chloroblast<br>
Heals 428 for 175 mana 3 cast time and 2.5 recast<br>
<br>
Hell, if Shaman don't like Torpor, trade me that for NT. ^_^ <p><center>

<br>
At least in my guild, casters can get a mod rod before a fight begins and hold it.  After the fight starts, any and all mod rods dropped are for clerics.  Period.<br>
<br>
Just a small point but a significant one.  I suppose it depends on how many mages you have, but if we have more than say 2 mages there, the others will be nuking not making more mod rods so druids can have some too.<br>
<br>
And even if you are doing a target mob that is unslowable (truly and verifiably unslowable rather than just hard to slow), the sheer number of buffs that shamans have to cast...even with MGB and group focus...is enough work to keep several busy during a raid.<br>
<br>
But I have yet to experience any raids other than target mobs where inability to slow is a pervasive problem.  (Flurry drakes in NTOV I guess? but other stuff is slowable).  MOST stuff in the game can be slowed.  It is the exception that it can't...and it is generally just one fight of many on a raid, even if it is the main event. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 8/3/02 5:54:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucassea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cassea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beats Me...<br>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 7:07:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> Graal,<br>

Druid do not have a better heal than Shamen.<br>
<br>
We have a spell with the same mana/heal ratio that heals for a larger amount in a longer time.<br>
<br>
There is a big difference.<br>
<br>
On raids Druids cast the very same direct heal that you do as that level 60 heal is a POS. It's two heals in one with twice the mana cost.<br>
<br>
Not having any other types of heals or a way to recover mana fast is what kills us on the big raids.<br>
<br>
What is also silly is that if Druids convince Verant to fix healing it will most certainly cause Shamen to get better heals also so...<br>
<br>
WHY IN THE HELL ARE TWO HEALING CLASSES THAT BOTH ARE BEING CRIPPLED BY LACK OF COMPLETE HEAL (or percentage based heal) YELLING AT EACH OTHER!!!!<br>
<br>
Sorry - I just had to shout that. Why don't Shamen and Druids just go out back and shoot each other and get it over with :)<br>
<br>
The problem at high level in EQ is Complete Heal! It now so powerful that no other heal matters on high level raids.<br>
<br>
We are on the same side. Yes Shamen have a few other things to do on raids but that does not mean we need to fight over heals.<br>
<br>
You do not fix Druids by putting down other classes.<br>
You do not fix your own class or if your class is balanced keep it that way by trying to keep Druids down. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

the problem is that when VI adjust healing for raids they have to unbalance the healing for grouping situations.<br>
They only way that they can fix that is by removing other abilities from the class that gets a better heal and thus you end up as a cleric that can cast sow. (in an extreme case)<br>
<br>
That and only that prevents a reall sollution. If you want to be able to fullfill a beter healing role in a group that is understandable (maybe even needed to some degree (yes i still believe a druid is a great group member when well played, at least the druids in my guild are)) but asking for a better healing role in a raid situation is asking for the impossible in my opinion (for druids, palladins and shamans)<br>
<br>
PS As far as I go they can give torpor to the druid class, that would make a lot of people here see how overrated that spell actually is. <p><br><i><u><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=142655>Stygiana Graeme </a></b></u></i></br>

<br>
The logic is squirrely there.<br>
<br>
At this stage, the group either already has a cleric (or a shaman) and so the druid healing is irrelevant, or the group is relying on a druid (with maybe a pally for backup) which can mean a lot of downtime.<br>
<br>
Increase druid healing when there is a cleric already there?  The world changes not at all in exp groups.<br>
<br>
Increase druid healing when there is a shaman already there?  Mobs are being slowed and you have two healers...it once again won't matter much.<br>
<br>
Increase druid healing when there is only a druid there?  Well it might make it possible for a druid healer to go to slightly more difficult exp camps.  Not the hardest exp camps, but harder ones.  <br>
<br>

NT is a much better heal than chloroblast in terms of hp healed per second. Mana efficiency isn't nearly the concern on raids that is in xp groups. How quickly you can heal is much more important than efficiency most of the time. In those situations where thatisn't the case, you have the same direct healing efficiency that shamans do.<br>
<br>
Oldoaktree, generally on the raids I've been on recently you can't take a step without tripping over modrods. Maybe there is an abnormal amount of mages on those raids, I don't know. When there are fewer mages, I'm sure that canni creates a much larger increase in mana regen for shamans than for druids. When modrods are available whenever needed, that advantage doesn't exist. BTW, mystical transvergence gives a much greater amount of mana returned per hp than canni does.  <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

<br>
Not true. My proposal for a new heal would be to change nature's recovery to a group heal. Still heals 900 but change duration to 1min and remove recast time. Not sure what would be appropriate mana cost for this, 600 maybe? This heal would imo be worthless 90% of the time in a xp group but great for keeping a group alive against an AE mob, the role druids most often are set to do on a raid. I presented this idea on the cleric boards once and was fairly well recieved so I guess wouldnt step on the clerics toes too much ;) <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

Making other healing classes &quot;nearly equally as good as clerics&quot; minus CH is pretty much ridiculous.  Stick in any class in that statement and it sounds ridiculous.

Are you also pissed when you can't raid because you dont' have shamans ?<br>

Are you also pissed that you can't raid because theres no mages for mod rods ?<br>

The game is based on grouping and class inter-dependence, if you don't like it, you're playing the wrong game.  EQ has always been about grouping and classes.<br>
<br>
&quot; want to see that EQ has 3 healer classes as it has 3 tank classes. On the other hand I want to see that EQ has 3 classes that can benefit as much as a chanter (CC, KEI and slow/haste in on char is godly as all are requiered, and I think that Shamans loose xp-group spots only to Encs).&quot;<br>
<br>
By your logic your might as well reduce all eq classes to 1 class that can do everything because you're removing the main idea for choosing a certain class.<br>
<br>
&quot;Against the targets our guild goes, we can often times go without a Warrior as MT, but take me, a Paladin in not even full HoT gear. I want to be able to do those raids with Warriors but - no offense to that class, I mean if you're simply not on or cannot come to raid for whatever reasons - not Clerics for example (though people will mourn about the 6% xp loss if they have to take Paladin rezzes).&quot;<br>
<br>
Hate to break it to you, but in the high end game you pretty much can't go without a Warrior/Def combo.  Guess what, no warriors?  No raid then.  Its just not a cleric issue, many classes are important and if you don't have enough of them you simply can't do certain raids.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can start a not uber raid without any Druid, Shaman, Bard, Necro, Mage, etc., but not without Cleric, at least one Enchanter. Any tank on is enough, add a few dmg dealers and the raid is a go. That is plain wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
Even in a 'non-uber' raid you're still going to need sufficient classes regardless if its a cleric, a shammie, and ench, etc.  When you enter the luclin high end content such you'll find out the hard way that not only is just simply clerics, its enchanters, shamans, warriors, tanks, mages, and yes even druids.   You lack in one area and your raid is hosed.<br>
<br>
There is nothing 'wrong' with encounters that require certain classes.  Thats the way the game is designed and always has been.  Without doing so would hugely reduce the difficulty in the examples and would make most encounters trivial.<br>
<br>
So you may be pissed about it, but Verant designed this game with grouping in mind and made advantages and disadvantages to every class.  My suggestion is if you're lacking classes that bad, is to add some because the further you go up on the high end content chain, the more inter-class dependency there is.<br>

Been there, done that. Sucks not to have kei and sos, but all you really need is one enchanter to cover that. If not, you still have bardsong and shaman haste. But if mana is a problem, just add a few more clerics.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Are you also pissed when you can't raid because you don't have warriors ?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Don't need them most of the time. And even if you do, one to three is usually plenty. If there is no warrior though, use a paly or sk and just add a few more clerics.<br>
<br>

Been there, done that. Enchanters can slow too. Sucks not to have all the stat buffs, but you can get by. But even when you do need them, one to three is usually enough. And if hp are lower because of the lack of buffs, just add a few more clerics.<br>

Been there, done that. Sucks not to have CoH, but you can always fall back on necros for extra mana, or just add a few more clerics.<br>

Defensive helps make it easier on clerics, but without defensive, just step up the healing some. I know when we have fights and defensive runs out, the clerics just step up the rotation a bit and keep that warrior alive. It is much less messy than switching. Without defensive, any tank can take a hit as well as a warrior, and most can control aggro much much better. And aggro control is often more important than the slight hp edge warriors have. No good to have a CH rotation on that massive hp warrior if the mob is beating on someone else. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalyenatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talyena Trueheart</A> at: 8/5/02 2:29:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Watcher of the Grove</span><br>  Posts: 417<br> <font color=#333399>(8/5/02 3:38:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Class interdependency</span><hr size=1> Well posted Tal.<br>

Basically I agree on all points.  Clerics are the ONLY class you cannot raid without at all.<br>
<br>
And while you may need one to say three of other classes on other raids, for those same fights you need about 6 or 7 clerics.<br>
<br>
Anyone who tries to sweep how busted CH makes the game under the rug is only fooling themselves.<br>

Nothing of the kind.  While the game has been headed that way at least since Luclin, each class really can still be unique.  All the prior post really said was that the game was meant to be about class INTER-dependence, not class DEPENDENCE the way it is now with clerics. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 8/5/02 3:40:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utils.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tils</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.loopi.co.uk/bounce.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Finally Housebroken!</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#333399>(8/5/02 4:36:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=135>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.loopi.co.uk/tils2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Class interdependency</span><hr size=1> I dont agree with most of Talyena's points. <br>
<br>
If you do the high end stuff you do need Sos, Shaman Slows, Warriors yes probably you dont have to have mod rods but they make hella difference to a high end battle and a lot of the time do make the difference between win or lose. <br>
<br>
But im talking stuff like Ssra mobs (not rhags) and Aow etc not the lower end stuff like Vindi, Zland, Woushi :P  etc which for a guild who kills the high end stuff could be killed with 1-2 groups anyway. <br>
<br>
&quot;use a paly or sk and just add a few more clerics&quot;<br>
<br>
Fancy putting a Pally onto Aow and tank it the whole battle? Youll need more than a few more clerics hehe.<br>
