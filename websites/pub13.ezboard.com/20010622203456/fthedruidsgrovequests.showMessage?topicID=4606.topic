All I know is that when I did the quest on my server (Solusek Ro), Broodmother spawned mostly every night between 11 pm and 2 am Pacific time. How do I know for sure? Well, every night there was always some player or group of players waiting on her as well, and we were online around the same time. The night I finished the quest, it was a bit after 11:30 pm Pacific. (Again, this is one particular server.)<br>
<br>
My recommendation to you is to invis and go to her room and log off there. Check back when you can, and each time you log on, you might want to ask the zone if anyone knows when the last spawn was, if the quest was done, etc. Or you can sit there and camp her, but that is hella boring. <br>
<br>
Some rumors have indicated that you can trigger her, but I haven't seen anyone trigger her spawn on my server. If someone claimed they could do it, I'd like to watch them do it. So I'm a skeptic about triggering her.<br>

I had just gotten my control leash when I noticed that the broodmother was still up. I remember hearing someone shout, &quot;Don't kill the named Giants at the Fort&quot; only 20 minutes before, so I figured she was a pet or something by now. <br>
<br>
So I wander over to the giant fort just in time to see the the broodmother attacking the giants. Figuring someone was doing the quest right then, I followed the fleeing giant to the EW zone. No one stopped him and he dissapeared just as he reached the wall to the right of the zone.<br>
<br>
Cursing myself for not snaring Fergul, I waited around 15 minutes just to see what the broodmother would do next. To my surprise, the quest cycled and Fergul took off running again! I waited until he was almost to the dissapearing point, killed him, and got my leggings.<br>
<br>
Then I waited around for 15 minutes, and the quest cycled again! The quest cycled 6 times and Fergul dropped 6 pairs of leggings, which I let people in GD loot. After that the Broodmother never came back to the fort(I dunno what happened to her), much to the dissapointment of many waiting on a pair.<br>
<br>
I reported this as a bug. I dunno what started the Broodmother in this loop of named giant killing. Perhaps the person who attempted it earlier failed, or perhaps they got their pair and took off happily, not knowing the broodmother hadn't become a pet and was wandering the zone in a predetermined loop. I ended up burning my control leash, needing room to work on tailoring skills.<br>
<br>
I suspect the broodmother was keyed to become a pet when Fleeing_Fergul_00 was attacked, but for some reason he never was. Fleeing_Fergul_00 probably despawned, the Broodmother circled and attacked the giants again, Fleeing_Fergul_01 runs for the zone. When Fleeing_Fergul_01 to Fleeing_Fergul_x get killed, the broodmother never becomes a pet because she is keyed to Fleeing_Fergul_00. Just a guess :) Or maybe the Broodmother was never near anything when I started killing Fergul, as there were many people in GD that day.<br>
<br>
So i guess what I'm saying is keep an eye on the broodmother even if someone has already attempted the quest. That is.. Until they read my bug report and fix it.<br>

She was &quot;due&quot; as it had been 8-9 hours since I had last seen her.  I called out to the zone and everyone was kind enough to let her be. She took at least 7 minutes to get to the fort...  I even got tells asking me if I needed help.<br>
<br>
Anyhow.. Fergul was easy but took a lot of mana (winged death x5, plus roots).  Afterward, the BM became the pet of a drakkel wolf.  They need to fix her to despawn after the other giant is killed, or on a timer.  I don't know what happened to her after that, and I don't know if you can re-activate her when she is in this &quot;pet&quot; condition.  I am assuming a GM would have to reset her (despawn/respawn).<br>
<br>
Good luck.  Wish the leggings looked like Velious leather though 8(<br>

A lower level version of Fergul is always up inside the fort (unless players are killing him and giants for faction).  When the Broodmother is quested, as she wanders closer to the cave, that green version will despawn and a newer higher level Fergul will pop outside the fort.  That's the one you want to kill.<br>
<br>
Be warned, he runs as fast (or faster) than sow and if you're behind him chasing, you probably can't get a cast off of root without him running out of range and him despawning at the zone.  What I do now is to always wait for him along his path on the ledge so while he's running to me, and I'm spamming my root key to stop him. <br>

Version #1<br>
Green and is always up inside the fort.<br>
<br>
Version #2<br>
Spawns after you trigger the quest, and stands outside the fort.<br>
<br>
Version #3<br>
This one respawns RIGHT where #2 stands and runs. (if you targer #2, and wait, your target will poof, as you really are now seeing #3 that popped on the same point).<br>
<br>
If you attack #2, #3 DOES still usually spawn. Be warned, #2 won't poof at that point,and you will end up with TWO Ferguls running around.<br>
<br>
Buggy, buggy, buggy quest.<br>
<br>
I have personally had to do the quest 3 times for my legs, and have helped 4 others do theirs. <br>
<br>
You CAN hand in the harness to her when she is in PET mode, as long as she isn't in KOS pet mode. <br>
<br>
Also, if you have waited a VERY long time for her, check out the Tizmak caves, she frequently wanders DEEP in there, and becomes a pet, and stays. But, again, you can (be ready for a 30 minute run of warping, and fun pathing to get back) trigger the quest, by handing in the harness to her there also. Just as long as you aren't KOS to her current 'owner'.<br>

I already had my blood wolf harness (they will be auctioned sometimes in NFP if you're patient), went into CC and got the acid off the first orc I killed.<br>
<br>
Complete quest spoiler:<br>
1) Blood wolf harness -- I was able to purchase mine, so I can't speak to the difficulty of getting one.<br>
2) Sceptre/Bottle of karsin acid -- the zone to CC is in the orc fort in EW, run around the inner building and there's a clickable orb in a hut behind the inner fort.  Zone in and start killing orcs, they should drop with a single root and epic cast.  I got my acid off the first orc, could take up to a couple hours.<br>
3) Erdaf Restil is in a bar, all you have to do is track him, go in and turn left and follow your tracking.  Give him the bottle of acid or the sceptre off the queen in CC and get a Gem of Persuasion.<br>
4) Follow the icy river out of Thurgadin.  Invis up and follow the river through the shardwurm caves and hit track to see if broodmother is up ... everything in the cave but broodmother will con green at 56, broodmother cons blue.<br>
5) Once you exit caves, along the river, you'll be able to track to Vores the Hunter ... give him the harness and the gem of persuasion and he will give you a Control Harness.<br>
6) If you're heading south out of Thurgadin, broodmother is in the first cave on the left ... just follow the left wall down to her.  Invis down to her, get next to her out of aggro range of the other wurms, take invis off, hand her the harness, REINVIS, and take off running to the giant fort at neg 3000, neg 3000.  You want to beat the broodmother there.<br>
7) If you track as you head to the fort, you'll notice that Fergul and Grakl will be at the top of your tracking, indicating that they've depopped and repopped outside the fort.  Set yourself up just northeast of the fort so that you'll be between Fergul and the EW zone.  This second Fergul will con green to 56.  Target him and wait.<br>
8) When the broodmother gets to the fort, she'll attack Grakl, green Fergul will disappear from your target window, and you'll see a third Fergul that will con blue to 56.  Target him and root him as quickly as possible once he gets out of aggro range of the rest of the giant fort.  He runs as fast as or faster than SoW, which is why it's important to be northeast of the fort and to root as quickly as possible (it might even help to have SoC memmed in case he starts to away from you).<br>
9) This Fergul took about 80% of my mana bar (counting one resist on breath of ro and one on winged death).  He died with exactly 1 178-DD root, 3 rounds of winged death, 3 rounds of breath of ro, 3 rounds of ES arms, and 1 round of epic.  Watch out for adds while you root/rot him as there's a frost giant that roams a bit northeast of the fort.<br>
10) Damn, them's some ugly leggings! <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

We did this quest 4x in a row as she just kept going in a large circle in the zone. The longest part was just waiting for Fergul to repop so another person could get in line for them killer leggings. :)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukatlynel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katlynel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/7/01 9:14:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.asianavenue.com/indiegrrl/faedrake.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Broodmother</span><hr size=1> No no no, I have my Velious textures on ...
