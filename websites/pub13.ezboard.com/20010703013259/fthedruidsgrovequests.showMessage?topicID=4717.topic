<br>
But..<br>
<br>
The Mage epic yields a L46 Spell, which is where everyone's assumption of a minimum level of 46 required to finish the quest comes from. <br>
<br>
However, previous to the design of the Druid epic, there are the 3 hybrid spell quests that result in L49 spells, yet the quest cannot be completed sucessfully until L50 is attained. <br>
<br>
If you are 46 already, then turn it in and find out. The worst case is that the NPC eats the items (and then you petition and *hopefully* the GM will reimburse the items). <br>
<br>
I thought I remembered tales of druids being 50 who attained the epic, but it was so long ago, I do not know if I am remembering correctly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucuchulainekynthelig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cuchulaine Kynthelig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/11/01 9:37:30 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what lvl to do epic?</span><hr size=1> I doubt you are going to find the answer you seek here. In order for someone to know it, they would have had to take the risk and turn those items in at or below your level. If anyone has done that, it's altogether possible they wouldn't tell anyone the results. They might feel that they took the risk, why shouldn't you? I'm not commenting on whether that attitude is right or wrong, just that it might exist. <br>
<br>
If you want advice, then mine is to hold onto the stuff, concentrate on leveling, and turn it in when you reach level 51. Then you know you're safe. I wouldn't turn in the items unless you have no problem with losing them. I also wouldn't count on a GM getting them back for you.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

VS#2 is about 10 levels higher than you.  Not to be mean, but if my guild came in and saw a 46 lvl person camping it, we'd consider it not camped.  It is sorta like a 5th level person camping Dvinn, won't happen.  Furthermore, even if you were to &quot;join&quot; the raiding party, it is highly likely you would die quickly and be more of a hinderance than a help for the raiding party.  Hence, you would also probably not receive the item from the raiding party due to higher level players needing it also, unless they were really good friends of yours.  Usually, there are tons of Druids and Rangers who show up to kill him for exactly the same reason.  Just to reach his room, I would not suggest you to be there till at least 51 lvl.<br>
<br>
My suggestion?  Buy a Paw of Opella if you are looking for a wis item in your main hand.<br>
<br>
And level up.<br>
<br>
And for your question, no one is stupid enough to try it below 50th level.  Level up, get to 50th level, then try to get a group for VSR. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaslethalo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>maslethalo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/11/01 11:01:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what lvl to do epic?</span><hr size=1> I agree with hanah<br>

<br>
Actually, we killed VS2 yesterday, and had 3 people under 50 in the party. No one even came close to dying. Of course, none of the under 50s (only one was a druid or ranger) got consideration for a stone. Anyway, they didn't die. I don't think any were a hinderance either, especially since 2 were clerics, including my alt. I specifically brought my 46 cleric instead of my 55 druid, because we needed healing, and my cleric heals about 5 times better than my druid, even taking into account mana pool. I know that for a fact, these are my characters, Iplay them, so I know how well they heal, compared to each other. <br>
<br>
Whether you think it is approriate for him to get a shot at a stone, or for his guild to get one for him, is irrelevant, unless you are in that guild, and are asked to do that. I wouldn't help kill VS2 for a person under 50, but it's not my place to tell someone else they can't.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

What are druids good at in combat?  Nuking, dotting, rooting, rebuffing, and healing.  The problem about a 46 lvl Druid in a group of 50+ (I try to take him down with 55+ for the overkill), The Greater Healing is not too much effective.  The Buffs can be given out by any other druid there and be more effective by the higher level druids.  Therefore, most 46 lvl druids will try dotting, nuking, snaring, rooting it.  Most of this will not hold due to the level difference.  This will also cause an agro listing.  The druid will also probably try to sit to med causing even more agro.  VS summons druid.  The druid will then get torn apart by something a lot bigger.  This is how most pre 50 level druids get wacked in here.  Not a good idea to bring in a 46 level druid to kill an Uber mob.  I would not consider a greater healer too much of a healer myself and he/she would find him/herself in a group already with the proper number of healers for tanks.  They could help, but my suggestion is to stay far away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaanluilwhisperwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aanluil Whisperwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/12/01 8:10:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what lvl to do epic?</span><hr size=1> Be that as it may, I am in a guild that is large enough to take him down and most of the druids higher than me have their epic already.  So the fact that i may be able to get it is possible.  But that is NOT what this thread is about.  It is about whether or not i can turn the stuff in at lvl 46 and get the elaborate scimitar or will the NPC eat my stuff and ill have to start it over again.  And by the way if im there camping it it will be with my guild.  So for those who think that just because it may be for me a lvl 46 does NOT mean its not camped and it WOULD be considered KSing me to think that it isnt camped and to come in and take the spawn.  If it was you in my shoes you would be pissed if i walked in and said your not high enough so your not REALLY camping it so ill be taking the spawn thank you very much.

If you were by yourself, even Verant would consider this as being &quot;Not Camped&quot;.  This ruling has been enforced by Verant many times especially with the RF camp.  The same rules apply here.  If I was in your server and VSR poped, having a group with me, we would kill him even with you in the room by yourself.  You could /petition all you want, it would not make a difference.  Verant has stated that 1 person in an area of an Uber mob is NOT considered &quot;Camped&quot;.  A group or groups &quot;capable&quot; of killing the mob is considered &quot;Camping&quot;.  When RF is up, whoever has enough people at the earliest point to kill RF has rights to it, not 1 person, not 1 group.  Idealistically, 1 high 50s lvl group can kill VS#2.<br>
Furthermore, you would run the risk of dying from any of the pops that can agro you in the surrounding areas.  I don't see your problem, if you are in such an uber guild that all the other druids have their epics already, why don't they just power level you?  It is easy to get from 46-51.  Can take a week or 2 in normal game play without an Uber guild.  No hell levels.<br>
<br>
If you are in such of a wonderful Guild that will camp an epic item for a 46th level non enchanter/cleric, why can't they powerlevel you to 51 also?  I'm gona start a character on your server just to get into a guild that does that!!!<br>
<br>
Personally, I have NEVER heard of an Uber guild that will camp Epics for pre 50th level non-enchanter/clerics.  Either you are in a very rare guild who believes all 51st level players should have epics or someone is pulling your chain and you, my friend, are the idiot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualuien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aluien</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/12/01 10:46:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what lvl to do epic?</span><hr size=1>      This board has turned into a bunch of sniviling brats since the Epics came out.

The only way you're gonna find out is to go and try it.<br>
<br>
     I would petition it. If a GM says he cannot answer that, then ask him to stand there while you hand the stuff in and see if he'll reimburse you for them if they poof. <br>

I didn't make any turn ins at all until I was 51 (Antonica Spirit). I didn't have all the parts to turn in until then. It never even occured to me to wonder about it. Heck, until I got to 4 mobs to go, I didn't even really work that hard on the epic. I technically started it about 8 months ago, when hunting FGs at level 42, I decided to try for the tainted. I got the mammoth while waiting on a rez to Hate, I got the goblin while helping a friend camp for Bergurgle, etc, etc, etc. Only about the last 6 ot 7 mobs have I actually goner to that zone with the purpose of trying for the epic piece. Now, I am one kill (Faydeder) away, and will finish it this weekend. <br>
<br>
The specific turn-in you are asking about I didn't do until level 55. In fact, about 2 weeks ago. I don't know of anyone who has attempted it earlier than 50, and I don't really know anyone who would risk it. I know I wouldn't. Like I said, my advice is to put the stuff in the bank, and concentrate on leveling. I'm not saying that because I don't want you to get the epic pre-50. Your not in my guild, or even on my server, so I could care less. I'm giving that advice, because I personally don't think all that hard work is worth risking, and my gut-feeling is that a GM would NOT re-imburse you if the NPC ate the items. I'm just saying that you aren't going to find anyone to tell you for sure, because I think the chances that someone your level or below having tried it is slim to none.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

If all of the epic encounters will speak to you about the quest, you may be high enough to do it - however there always seemed to be disagreement about whether the NPC's were refusing to speak to players due to faction or level.  Either way, it comes down to the player's risk.

Ya dont want your hard work getting eaten by an NPC, and i wouldn't count on getting reimbersed.<br>
<br>
EDIT: And think about it, getting from 46 to 50th aint too terribly hard at all. You could prolly wait 1 week to turn stuff in, and then you'd not only be 50th, you'd also be very close to completing your epic :) <p><A><img src=http://elawnah.homestead.com/files/thingy.JPG height=156 width=392></A>

As for Hanah, i think your just B!^(#ing because you couldnt get anyone to help you that soon...Looks to me like your friends in EQ may not be that good of friends.  You see, i am in the guild i am in now because we help each other out.  Not because we make you wait till your a certain lvl before we help you.  Thats retarded.  Why would i want to hang out with people who put an emphasis on lvling before they will help you.  And as to PLing, we dont PL people just because they are in the guild.  It is a personal choice as to wethere you PL someone.  Its not done just because your in the guild. I feel sorry for you if your guild is full of asses that wont help you because they like you...they will only help you if your high enough in lvl.  Doesnt sound like a great group of friends.  Well, ive gotten enough of an answer here...seeing as all i did was ask a question about something and a bunch of jealous people freaked out about someone maybe finishing their epic lower than they did.  seems to me like if your taking it that seriously maybe you should take a break from the game and get in touch with some real people and go have some fun.<br>

Thank you!  Have a nice day! =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualuien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aluien</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/14/01 3:22:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what lvl to do epic?</span><hr size=1> &quot;I don't know of anyone who has attempted it earlier than 50, and I don't really know anyone who would risk it.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the beginning of this quest there were many people that risked many things. I personally did two of the cleansed spirit portions twice whe we didn't know who to turn the items into yet (Stupid Gnome). I hope that there are still some adventurious folks out there that are willing to try :)<br>
<br>
I still hope he gets it. Would be cool to see a druid able to cast Wrath of Nature before he can cast Skin Like Nature (that's saying that the epic CAN be obtained and even more can even be USED if it can be obtained pre 50) <br>
<br>
He would be able to answer SOOOOO many questions if he got it  :). Good luck man! <p>Aluien Shadowstorm<BR>
