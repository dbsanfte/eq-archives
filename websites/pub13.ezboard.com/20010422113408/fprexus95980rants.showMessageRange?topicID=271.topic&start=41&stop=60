You may have started this thread and are participating in it but don't place too much importance on your role in the actual debate.  Like the Sky raid you attended you are merely a single paticipant, nothing more.<br>
<br>
You represent an opinion that should be heard and is a fairly common one to be found, but in the end all you are is a single voice on this topic and like the rest of us a single voice by itself is fairly irrelevant.  Demonstrating a sarcastic, dismissive attitude doesn't actually change that fact.<br>
<br>
The debate as a whole is what matters and the more input that is provided the better as that is how people begin to understand each other.

My position on this topic is not that hard to grasp. Seeing it from my point of view may be difficult for you, considering that you're one of the people directly benefiting from something that I don't believe should be happening.<br>
<br>
I started this thread because I was having trouble explaining to people where I was coming from. People have come here and challenged my opinion, asked for clarification, and agreed with me. Your post reiterated everything that had already been said by the people who share your point of view. I believe I have already addressed it all. Thank you for sharing your opinion on the matter. However, had the point of this thread been a debate, it would have merely been a step backwards, not a step forwards.</font><P>--Bremmin Ironsoul<BR>

Fortune has more to do with this than skill, and it doesn't take an army of 30 people to reach Quillmane.<br>
<br>
Yes, Gomb, not putting in the time required to gain those items does make you unworthy of getting your epic. Put in the work to get the item. It's that simple. Your example is equal to saying that a person who only works twenty hours a week as a cashier should get a mansion and a Rolls Royce. Your devotion to RL really doesn't have much to do with it, and neither does your worth as a person.</font><P><html>

<br>
Don't these two things go directly in the face of each other Iskander?  You say that it is fine to multi-quest a item that you haven't put the time in for yet then you turn around and say that somebody who does with that with a crown is unworthy...<br>
<br>
Let me lay a question out there for everybody who is claiming that you have to put the time out for it.  How many hours a week do you play and do you have any commitments in real life?  Do you get home from High School or your four college classes and log into EQ.  Or do you actually head to work, come home spend as much time with your wife/family as possible, and then finally try to fit in as much EQ as you can before rinsing and repeating.<br>
<br>
I know that I do the second part.  I'm not asking to be handed everything in game because I have a real life.  I am doing everything else for this EPIC that I can.  If I could spare the time needed to *earn* the crown for myself I'd do it in a heartbeat to be able to proudly say that I completed the EPIC entirely on my own (Besides the obvious good friends involved).  Dispite that though when I do gain my epic I will be just as proud knowing that I have earned it in my eyes and in the eyes of all my friends.  <br>
<br>
I just still don't see where the whole *This is fine, but this isn't* opionion is coming from.<br>
<br>

<br>
Quillmane = sitting on your arse with a tracker (hopefully) waiting for the bugger to spawn, while mobs that generally max out around level 30 wander the zone.<br>
<br>
7th Isle = coming to a raid in one of the more intense <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> and</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> time consuming zones in Norrath, paying for keys and donations to the raid leaders (for cost of coffins and Sky stones), getting killed repeatedly.<br>
<br>
The difficulty and resources needed to reach the target area, and the difficulty of the mobs in said target area, in these two examples is vastly different.<br>

<br>
The whole argument in this thread seems to be having *earned* a item or not.  If somebody hasn't camped Quillmane, have they truly earned the Cloak?  (Replace this with any of the time consuming Mage camps.  Quill, Nez, Neh'Ahir, etc)  And if they haven't truly earned the cloak how can it be said that they have earned their EPIC?  See what I'm saying?<br>
<br>
Again, I just fail to see the distinction between these.<br>

<br>
Did you trade for anything your character uses instead of looting it?  Did you buy jewelery instead of making it?  Have you ever ported to Kunark rather than taking a boat?  Did you ever get CoH'd deeper into a raid?  <br>
<br>
If you said yes to any of these, then you haven't EARNED your character, their level and their equipment, by your very own logic. <br>
<br>
And I will tell you so every time I see you.<br>
<br>
Did you ever skip a grade in school?  (Not too likely)  Did you ever get a ride to school instead of walking every day through 6 feet of snow like your grandfather did?  Were you ever sick and decided not to do the homework the other kids were assigned? <br>
<br>
You didn't earn your diploma.<br>
<br>
And I will tell you so every time I see you.<br>
<br>
You have an opinion.  It's not logical, but most opinions aren't.  Go on having that opinion --- but don't start telling people that they, their epics, their equipment, or anything else weren't earned and thinking you're in the right.  <br>
<br>
Unless they exploited a bug, they earned it by the only true measure, that the game let them have it.<br>

I have never skipped an island in Sky. I have never gotten a ride to isle seven in Sky instead of going up through the islands. I was never sick and decided not to participate at all in a raid to get an item for my epic quest.<br>
<br>
Your arguments are illogical. Furthermore this issue does not concern you. You have an opinion, but please don't go telling people how they should or should not behave, especially considering that none of us have met you and you aren't even from our server. <br>
<br>
Until you level a character to 54 on our server, and play in it's environment, you will have no idea what you're talking about.<br>

That is part of the problem with this thread, it's innate hypocracy.  His post was a bit flamey but he is hardly alone in using that tactic in this thread to I assume add flavor to their position.  Still , his point is pretty clear, what is the line between earned and not earned.<br>
<br>
It is easy to fixate on a single example like 7th island of sky (your never bought jewelry in 7th island reply kind of makes no sense).  If in the end if all you are is a 7th island of sky fanatic thats fine, but it would be interesting to hear your non-flame opinion (if that is possible) on where the line should be drawn between that which is earned and that which is not.  I suggest non-flame because all beginner level sarcasm and &quot;begone you&quot; type remarks do is indicate an inability to actually reply to a point. </font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uperplexbamboozeler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Perplex Bamboozeler</A> at: 3/27/01 5:10:45 pm</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#F5F5DC><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujyzanidyla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jyzan Idyla</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>3/27/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FF0000>5:04:08 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><BR><img src=http://eyesoferollisi.homestead.com/files/salute.jpg height=177 width=100></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: My position on isle seven in Sky</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">My arguments are illogical?

<br>
Since you undoubtedly didn't understand that, I will put it another way.... your arguments are the ones that are very illogical, so you should not be saying anyone else's are.<br>
<br>
This whole "seventh island of sky" qualification that you are adding means nothing other than that is what you use to determine if someone has earned their epic.  You're wrong if you try and sell this as anything other than your own opinion, and if you have ANY bit of logic in your brain you have to agree with that.<br>
<br>
I do play on Prexus, I have a level 51 shaman named Emeril Prexusbane.  I have been to the plane of Sky (on 3 servers), but I'm not going to get into a pissing match over my qualifications, because it's stupid.  This argument concerns me at least as much as it does you, since you're besmirching the efforts of fellow friends and players of Prexus.  <br>
<br>
As to the "So go away" sentence fragment at the end of your post, plus your general dismissive attitude, please, keep it up.  Every fragmented utterance diminishes your opinion in the eyes of others.</font><P><center>

Anyway, it's been a long, long time since I've posted on prexus.com, for a lot of complex reasons that I'll post about later.  What I see here, though, is someone stating an opinion and then being told &quot;You're wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh.  How typical.<br>
<br>
Well, fine, you may think that Bremmin is wrong.  But Bremmin also has every right to feel as he does, and I happen to agree with him.  To utilize a shortcut like this to complete an epic quest strikes me as cheesy in the extreme.  Quite frankly, it strikes me as cheesy to purchase ANY piece of your epic quest.  I'm definitely in the minority here, but multiquesting is lame, IMHO.  I could not be as proud of something I multiquested as something I earned myself, with the help of friends, but with the items coming straight into my hands.<br>
<br>
There seems to be such an attitude of entitlement here.  It really hasn't sunk into everyone's consciousness that not everyone is going to have every piece of equipment.  If you choose not to spend two days in Sky, or days camping Quillmane, or dozens of dragon raids to get books, or whatever, then no, you haven't earned the right to wield an epic weapon in my book.<br>
<br>
The people I feel badly for are those who work at their quests, make the appropriate sacrifices to be able to spend the time doing it, and finally end up with something they can be proud of.  Epic weapons cannot be compared to a suit of banded armor or a piece of common jewelry.  If you don't do the work yourself, and take shortcuts, then it does indeed cheapen the value of the item, and detracts from those who went the long way around.<br>
<br>
There's nothing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> epic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about being CoH'd into an area that was designed to be difficult to reach.  It's like having a smart friend take your SATs...sure, you got a good score, but did you earn it?<br>

No.<br>

Note that all the above is my opinion, and is not intended as a personal flame toward anyone in particular, including any mages who get their epic in this manner.

<br>
Paragon said what I was next going to say. You can camp Quillmane solo. It's possible. You don't have to drag anyone else into it. Yes, it's much easier with a tracker, but that's only one person who is helping you.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing, minimum, it takes 30 to reach Isle 7. That's 30 people who, using Chronnos's statement as a guideline, spend at least 6 hours getting there. You've also got to account for the platinum spent on keys, sky stones, and coffins. That's a lot of collective work and manhours to get to Isle 7.<br>
<br>
With that being said, it is much harder and significant to get a Crown than it is a cloak from Quillmane. You're dissing the efforts of everyone who worked their asses off to get to Isle 7 by porting up for 5 minutes to loot a crown when you've never been there yourself. Also, if you think about it, it's grunt work getting a cloak from Quillmane...sitting on your arse, waiting for him to pop, then tagging him enough times for a cloak to drop. Quillmane pales in comparison to the spirocs on isle 5 or the bees on Isle 6.<br>
<br>
It's not a big deal to get an item that someone sat on their keyster waiting to happen. It's different when you take advantage of the work of dozens of people to get an item you were not there to fight to.<br>
<br>
Perplex, I have nothing against reinforcements. None at all. What I do object to are people being ported up to PoS, who have never fought to Isle 7, so they can loot a crown. You could say it's like me being ported in to EJ after Severilious is killed so I can loot the green scale that 36 people &quot;earned&quot;.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Unless they exploited a bug, they earned it by the only true measure, that the game let them have it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yeah, that's very true, but there's a big lack of honor in just being zipped in to a place you've never even been to so that you can get a huge piece of your epic out of the way. Practically, I would rather not let a Crown rot, say, if all the mages who had been to Isle 7 already had either a Crown or an Orb of Mastery, but we're far from that scenario on our server. I know I'd be grateful as heck if I was CoHed down to the Queen's chamber in Chardok to loot an Ancient Blade for my epic, but I've been there before, and I'd do it only if all the warriors there didn't need it. I'd still feel a tinge of guilt in the back of my mind because I wasn't there to earn it myself, but maybe I'm just different in that way. I'm a man of principle...some say I've not seen enough of the world to be realistic enough. /shrug</font><P><html>

<br>
Let me outline it for you. I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> am</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> passing judgements on people I've never met, people who I've never met who are summoning corpses to Isle Seven from Isle One and eliminating the primary challenge in the Mage epic. <br>
<br>
Why do I feel that it's OK for me to do this? Because I am in part responsible for creating the situation. <br>
<br>
IMHO his post was personal. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you said yes to any of these, then you haven't EARNED your character, their level and their equipment, by your very own logic. And I will tell you so every time I see you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
I have not personally said to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anyone anything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of this nature.<br>
<br>
Where do I feel the line should be drawn?<br>
<br>
People have repeatedly argued that since mages multi-quest Pegasus Cloaks that this is no different. I disagree. I feel that accumulating the wealth to trade for a Pegasus Cloak and finding somebody who is willing to trade one is probably just as difficult as getting one in South Karana.<br>
<br>
The difference between these two situations is that there is no comparison in difficulty between summoning to isle seven and fighting there. Summoning is certainly no cakewalk, simply because people are impatient, but it has nothing on the difficulty of fighting to isle seven.<br>
<br>
This upsets me because it's an ongoing perversion of a generous act by a group of people who worked extremely hard to get to isle seven. We intended for Petoffen to summon up and get a crown. He altruistically gave the first crown he got to one of our mages. <br>
<br>
Thanks, Pet.<br>
<br>
However, it's gone from being a nice thing we did for Petoffen to being a nice (?) thing we did for the entire server. <br>
<br>
I didn't want to do a nice thing for the server. <br>
<br>
If I sound bitter, or sarcastic, it's probably because I feel used. Nobody asked me if I wanted every mage on the server to get their crown thanks to what I did. If somebody had, I probably wouldn't have helped, or gone. I probably would have jumped!<br>
<br>
If I seem to be fixating on a single example it's because it's the only example I find relevant to the situation. There are no encounters in the game that I've experienced which equate to getting to isle seven in sky. <br>
<br>
Perhaps I feel it's easy to dismiss the analogies presented here because I don't think most of the people presenting them have ever been to isle six, let alone isle seven. Quite a few of them are uninformed opinions made by people who aren't involved.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel I'm unable to reply to points. Perhaps most of the points I see here I don't feel any need to directly respond to. I hope I've yet again cleared up my position for you and everyone else. I had no idea it was so important.<br>
<br>

I apologize. Your arguments are not that illogical. However, I find them to be rediculously out of context. I especially liked that slam on my education, and your attempt to relate EverQuest to school. If you would like me to argue them in a manner that has nothing to do with the topic of this post, which would be isle seven in the plane of sky, I will.<br>
<br>
Skipping a grade in school is irrelevant. When you skip a grade in school it's because you have already learned something. Meaning that you are not skipping anything, you are instead being classified differently in terms of your knowledge. <br>
<br>
I live in the temperate northwest. Neither me nor my grandfather were forced to walk through six feet of snow. <br>
<br>
I was sick occasionally, and I did once or twice decide not to do the homework the other kids were assigned. My grade suffered for this reason. I did not do the work. I did not get the better grade. <br>

<br>
The people who do not agree with me at this point probably never will. The people who do agree with me at this point probably do so because they have their own opinion that is completely seperate from mine. <br>
<br>
As I have said previously in this thread, I have no need to justify my opinion to anyone, and I have no need to defend it. I respond here solely so that people might come to understand me and the situation better, because they seem to be making quite a few unfair assumptions about the entire thing.<br>

<br>
But in the end what we had here was some people who had the opportunity to get a very difficult item an easier way.  One thing you are failing to look at though Bremmin is the fact that the 4 mages that got crowns that night in sky have spent more time in that zone than you probably have.  You don't know anything about how hard they worked to get that item.  All you see is people taking the easy road and completely discounting the work they have done in the past.  EA isn't the only guild that can get to 7, and neither is SoS, KTF, Unity etc . . .   Could I get my guild to 7 in a day?  Sure can.  But in this case a golden opportunity presented itself, and 4 very deserving mages got what they needed.  <br>
<br>
If a person gets their epic . . then yes they deserved it.  A single mage crown doesn't make the item . . the hard work on all the steps and the dedication to go through it all is what makes the epic.  Is getting ported up to loot a drop easier than doing all the isles?  Yep sure is . .   But I don't see clerics needing rare items off gods, week long spawns, super rare spawns etc to the extent that mages do.  Mages got screwed in the epic department there is no doubt.  I can understand you not liking someone taking an easier road to getting an item . . but to say they don't deserve it is ludicrous.<br>
