I do agree with Drakkar if you ever rewrite it I would love to read it.  <br>
<br>
Those stories that are written only for your self to read are some of the best I have ever read.  <br>
<br>
Dang hate getting old the memory goes so fast.  I was setting here with the story I read like that in my head and danged if I can remeber the Author or the name of the story.  I just remeber that it was published after the authers death by her son.   It was the mussing of the people she meet and interreacted with on a trip she made to Kansas City from St Louis in 1866.   Oh will come to me later I am sure.  <br>

<br>
The Savage Song.  &lt;a pseudo-fairytale, pseudo-creation fable&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
  She could feel the frosted night peeling away from the ground, sliding away; discarded, a useless skin under the bombardment of gaudy daylight.  Her eyes opened, and She stirred languidly under the vacuum of the Void which lies behind the frozen stars, far beyond the homes of the gods and the mortal soil of the world.  As She stirred, so did the Void around Her.  It came around, circling about her, wolves and vultures of another world, wolves and vultures which have never lived, circling prey.  With a voice which has never truly spoke, It cried out to Her, mewling, moaning, howling for Her.  It hungered for the Song.<br>
<br>
  Away from a chilly earth the Night returned to Her, slipping down through the loose soil and in between the cracks scored upon the pillars of the earth to find Her side, to rest beside Her.  And the Walker drew the Night close to Her and read him as a book.  And he opened before Her sweetly, a lover for Her beloved, and within the blackness of his folds the deeds of all the beings which crawl upon the distant earth were made known to the Walker.  She tore the stars from their places and flung them across the Void, she grasped the Moon and wrenched it free so that Her Divine eyes may see the darker, deeper beauty within him. She heard the sighs of lovers and the cries of the murdered; She tasted the sweat of passion and the acrid sharpness of spilt blood; She drew breath and caught the scent of secret rites committed quietly, treacherously under the thrall of darkness; She felt the last whisper of the dying pass over Her as it slid coolly through the branches of a young forest; She saw the twisting serpent which had caught its own tail - She saw the dance of Life and Death. The Walker smiled.  It was good.<br>
<br>
  An expected pain gnawed through Her.  She had known the Night, and in that engendering She would bear a new creation which was as old as She.  She was already ripe with it, Her being swelling with a child which had gorged upon the spinning darkness of another spent Night.  The Night had come home to Her, and their coupling brought about a child always.  She let the Night slip gently from Her fingers, drew Her hands to Her belly, drew breath deeply into Her.  Deeper, deeper, god-lungs filling in an air-less Void, filling with the fruit of Night which She had plucked from him for its ripeness.  Dreams, Night Terrors, Creation, Murder filled Her lungs.  It was time to bear Her child.<br>
<br>
  Her lips parted, stretched, tore.  Her jaw dislocated from Her, Her chest ruptured.  Divine vocal cords frayed and snapped under the strain of creation.  And it came forth, ululating and mad, hungry and beautiful, the Mortal Song, the seething thrust of blood through taut veins, the screaming unpretentious self-importance of the Noontime Sun raged forth from Her, ravaging the Void and scattering it into the mindless emptiness which it was meant to be.  Wet and raving, electric and proud it hurtled through the homes of the gods, through the opaque vastness of the gaps between the stars, it punctured both the deepest blue and the dense obstruction of thunderheads, and Dawn broke over the world.<br>
<br>
  The Walker collapsed silently into the Void and smiled.  It was good.<br>
<br>

There.  Happy? =)  It's short, I know, but I like this version better.  It really is much more....um....savage than the first version.  Now if you'll excuse me, there's a storm outside and dawn will be breaking soon.  I have to sit on my porch awhile.<br>

<br>
Women in Power.  Yeah, I know it's a bondage magazine.  Anyway, the idea of a goddess seems so much more powerful, so much more terrifying than the stale, wrathful male deity that Christianity seems to have burned into me.  The Goddess I write about - The Walker of the Violet Twilight, the Black Mother, Tunare - is one part Shiva, one part Hecate, one part Khali, one part insanity.  I couldn't see myself worshipping a being like Her, but I truly revere Her, and Her belief in Beauty over Morality, Life over All, even if it is life through darkness.  Creation through Destruction - a neat idea: the basis of living, I think.<br>
<br>
Night &amp; Day.  A painfully trite symbol, and stifling in my writing.  I should get over it.  Ever notice that it's always night in my stuff?  Maybe it is because I am awake at night and not during the day &lt;I work nights&gt;..  I think the night looks better than the day anyway - streetlights on wet asphalt really gets to me.<br>
<br>
Murder and Birth - Humwawa.  Humwawa is a murderer.  Disregard the divine guidance of the Red Right Hand which directs him to these acts - he is morally culpable for murder.  I've been told that Humwawa is honorable.  He is not.  He is a killer.  Why would a *relatively* stable college student use so much murder in his writing?  I've been toying with the Creation through Destruction idea.  Humwawa came out as the stylized version, who kills so that the Mother can call the spirits of the dead back home to the Void, where they can be reborn in the light of the Dawn &lt;The Savage Song&gt;.  The idea is strictly stylized, strangely Christian &lt;or at least something a Cathar would dredge up&gt;, and fatally flawed.  The premise behind the theory is a hacked Nietzschean &lt;I can NEVER spell his name and I'm too lazy to go check my bookshelf&gt; &quot;notable quotable&quot;, paraphrased as follows - What does not kill me makes me stronger.  The idea of the perpetual destruction of the human persona so that a better, stronger being may emerge is a staple in my thinking.  As I age, my old self is killed by the emerging, newer self through experience and understanding.  Humwawa is Time, Experience, Understanding, and eventually Fatal.  There's no honor in that - I leave that to the Paladins and Clergy of the world.  Also, another paraphrased notable quotable from said-German philosopher who's name I can never spell - When one looks long into the Abyss, after some time the Abyss looks deeply into you.  Humwawa has been my abyss long before the birth of EQ.  So has the Walker.  EQ ws merely a tool to explore it.  My journal is called &quot;Humwawa&quot;.<br>
<br>
What's a Humwawa?  No, it's not a sexual term.  Humwawa is an assyrian deity, the &quot;Angel of Decay, The God of the Cedar Forests&quot;.  He's fascinated me since my early teens.  So I'm creepy - shoot me.<br>
<br>
I finished my last cigarette.  It's time to sleep.  Any comments/suggestions/bludgeonings?<br>

<br>
The god of decay...it does fit your writing after a fashion.  I think I would have put it more along the lines of Hecate the god of death but I am only putting my interpetation on it not yours.  <br>
<br>
We all see what we want to see when we look at something.  I tend to look for the &quot;light&quot; in any given situation.  However when it involves people I get very cynical.  <br>
<br>
Writting does not involve &quot;real&quot; people but people we see or want to see around us.<br>
