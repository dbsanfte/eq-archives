<br>
1.  Before we got there, a friend inside said he saw someone ooc &quot;trying to form FG raid.&quot;  The ooc person (a barbarian in crafted) said he never heard of the Brell board when we talked to him.<br>
<br>
2.  Minutes later as the raid began, we get a tell by a certain group of 55+ characters who mysteriously died at the FG sneak-in-spot (behind the first two FGs by the roamer near river of lava).  I won't name them since no FGs were missing and anything else would be conjecture.  But I think I know what they were doing.  These folks were in a well known guild and their cleric had a res stick.<br>
<br>
Luckily we had no problems, but with these two encounters I'm a tad uneasy about the continued success/usefulness of the Brell Board. <p><TABLE border="0" bgcolor="black">

There is a lack of FG raids where guild outsiders are taken and exposed to the world of raiding.  The FG's are &quot;supposed&quot; to be a training ground for new raid leaders and guilds coming of age.  But lately seem more to be farmed for drops.  Not pointing fingers at anyone but just my observations.  Most of the &quot;Indy&quot; raiders are not around anymore or have moved on, and increasingly guilds doing FG's don't accept outsiders. Just go wander into the Naggy and FG forum and take a look for yourself.<br>
<br>
 When I was with Warriors of Wrath we made it a point to always take some new folks with us every single raid we did.  We felt it was part of what being in a guild was all about, to not just help ourselves to some loot, but to introduce other folks to the whole raid experience. I'll always be proud of my time in WoW and the fine folks I was guilded with.  I think we introduced a lot of folks to new things and made a lot of friends in the process. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

<br>
my solution?<br>
<br>
I informed the person about the Brellboard and took them along on my raid as a compromise to diffuse the situation.<br>
<br>
It seems there are quite a few people (below 45) who are not aware of this board yet.<br>
<br>
I believe its an uncommon problem tho.<br>
<br>
I've been running FG raids, for lowbies, once a month, since October --  only had this problem once. <p>Nadia Nightengale<BR>

<br>
/em starts up the tractor<br>
<br>
I do FGs for xp.<br>
I do them for the phat lewts they drop. (well, for the one that Tranix drops)<br>
I've got a Tranix Crown on my twink, and one that I use as primary gear as well.<br>
I'm working to get Adune a crown.<br>
Like Adun said, if you want a PMT or PMM, let me or him know, cuz we will bring someone along to loot each on the raids we do.<br>
<br>
I disagree with the FGs having to be reserved, but I'm living by it.  Now I've got to put up with people telling me that I'm reserving them for the wrong reasons?  Just what is wrong with what I'm doing?<br>
<br>
Our raids go almost flawlessly.  We've had 1 casualty in the past 10 raids, and it was only because our cleric got ported when we had to pull Rokyl from Naggy.  Only other time I've personally died on FGs was when we had some newbie level 53 monk puller from Abyss who pulled Tranix +2 FGs to Ickhor's 2 group raid, thinking that our level 47 enchanter would just mez the extras...  *boggle*.<br>
<br>
Something that is really wacky concerning doing FG raids though, is that as a general rule, the more people you have doing FGs, the slower it goes.  You'd expect the opposite, but my experience isn't so.  For example, last night, we did FGs from start to finish, minus 2 at front and 2 in Naggy room, in 50 minutes exactly.  As a general rule of thumb, a full FG raid takes 1 hour.  When I've done them with Danforth and about 5 groups when he was leading his guild on a raid, it took about an hour to clear the TR.  The same thing happened with Harpers Naggy raid when clearing FGs beforehand.  If you don't have someone who can give orders well, and make people follow them, your raid is going to suck. <p>=============================

As I said I'm not pointing fingers at anyone.  Personally I could care less if you farm FG's till the cows come home.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> But</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->....we can't really come in here complaining that people don't know about this board, or that folks aren't semi-skilled in raiding if they are not given the chance to learn those basic skills.

<br>
Sorry but there is no magic manual that you receive when you make a character on Brell.  You learn by doing.  If you are not given the opportunity to learn, then the people who come in these forums bitching about others not knowing the rules need to look in the mirror and question why. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">
