<br>
As I see it, I have two options that I'm interested in:<br>
<br>
1) Keep Druids Grove running with the following changes:<br>
a) Try to find a new co-admin<br>
a.1) I would not accept an admin unless she was a long standing member of the druid grove that i recognized.<br>
b) Add more mods<br>
b.1) Its hard for me to accept mods that arent recognized contributers to the DG who have an interest in keeping it a clean, fair, safe place to post.<br>
c) Change the mod policy a bit to go back to the basics of what it used to be with a much stricter interpretation of the posting rules (which actually results in less moderation).<br>
d) remove some forums that are dead weight<br>
e) subscribe the the lower lvl CSC board to get rid of popups (its pretty cheap, i dont mind). But why people dont pay a measly $1 a month for access is beyond me!<br>
e.1) pps, ezboard is a great service. For those that think they are rude for the popups, i dont think that some of you realize the *huge* expenses they must have on maintaining their servers, code base, and especially bandwith. <br>
<br>
The truth is i havent played druid primary for over a year, and I took a break from EQ since march. Not many people know that though! I've played enchanter for a long time with poor, poor elial being my Theft of Thought bitch and druid gimp ;-) Continueing on as helping to run the DG is no big deal, since i've been doing it so long already.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) Shut down DG and move things over to Eqdruids.com<br>
<br>
I'm still torn between the two, but it would be one of those two choices. What do you think should happen? I've gotten emails on the subject...and it seems a bit split, with keeping the DG on EZ a bit in favour. But im interested in what you all have to say.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I wish I could help you with your decision.  If it were up to me, I'd close down this board and let the pieces fall where they may.  Sounds like you could place your time and energy elsewhere.  You've served your time, heh.  Some will go to the other board, some will never go no matter what.  The druid community will survive just fine, it's just that new posters will replace the old.  It's the nature of things, not really that big of a deal:)  Whatever you decide is cool.<br>

<br>
I understand the hard choice Elial. Not sure what I would do in your shoes. With admining two boards now I stay busy or I would offer to help you here. I could probably assist with moderating some though. Hell, two years later and I am still here Mon-Fri and only took a 6 month break a while back as we went through our OT days of hell.<br>
<br>
I would suggest trimming topics some though to make it easier for you and everyone else. There really isnt that much of a need for separate Kunark and SoV topics anymore, I dont go to half the topics on this board ever and I am closing in on 6000 EZBoard posts. Half of them here.<br>
<br>
Thats a twofold option though. With enough qualified moderators you can assign them each a topic to monitor to make their workload small, or do with less moderators and just trim topics down a bit.<br>
<br>
However, if this closes I will not be going to the new one. They have already left me with such a bad taste I would rather do without the druid board community then end up there, but thats just me.<br>
<br>
Bottomline regardless of ANYTHING else.<br>
<br>
You do whats best for you and your family and forget the rest.<br>

<br>
My very serious questions about scalability, redundancy, peak usage (especially duing patch times) and uptime -- all things which ezboard has had to deal -- were responded to with very trite answers.<br>
<br>
Granted even professionals can sometimes underestimate their traffic (happened many times when I was still with a dot-com company... also witness just last week with Orbitz.com where they admitted they underestimated required staffing levels) -- but usually these people have the money to fix their problems because they are dong this professionally and have gotten funding.<br>
<br>
My also very serious questions about profitability (or even break-even really) and funding (ie who is putting up the money and how much do they have) were ignored.  Maybe they do plan on making money on this venture.  But this was never communicated to me.<br>
<br>
Am I being too hard on them? Maybe.  But DG has some huge traffic going to it, especially when the servers are down.  If I'm going to switch, then I want to know that I'm going to get the same uptime and usability (ie site doesn't slow to a crawl when servers are down).  I want to know that the site is still going to be around in 6 months even if they need to buy new servers and get more bandwidth.  I want to know that I'm not going to have to have to pay for DG in the future, nor that I will be nagged for donations.<br>
<br>
Right now, all I know is that they are running on a duel P766 w/a wide SCSI RAID with &quot;plenty&quot; of bandwidth with weekly backups.  That really doesn't tell me enough for me to make an informed decision.<br>

<br>
It has a search that works.<br>
<br>
You can page to the last page of a thread, you can't do that with ezbored.  You need to load page one always first here.<br>
<br>
It is faster, much faster.<br>
<br>
The alternative buttons of communication is cool<br>
<br>
The quote feature is cool.<br>
<br>
The layout is nicer.<br>
<br>
It is a superior product all around.<br>
<br>
Moderation misuse=non existant.  laissez faire. <br>
<br>
Pop-up ads are hardly a consideration, for you know the second the plug is pulled here, they will pop up there.  In one form or another.<br>
<br>
Most of the &quot;problems&quot; people have to it, are just that they are used to the way this board works.  And they don't like change, even if what they are used to is broke.<br>
<br>
I like the fresh attitude over there.  There are posters coming out of the woodwork who were probably intimidated by the thorny aggressive attitude here.  Which is refreshing.  Even some long time posters have come back too.<br>
<br>
Personally I like that the most about it.  So unleashing(by compelling them) Scirocco, Tudamorf, Xiggen, Fox, and especially rtfm, over there would be a disservice, if not down and out evil.<br>
<br>
Honestly the timing and diplomacy on this whole thing was all whacked.  Fox alluded to some disconcerting emails, which might play into forming opinions as well.<br>
<br>
I don't care either way now, the timing and coordination(lack of) on this has messed up totally a bloodless coup.<br>
<br>
I will come here for hard-tack, with all the maggots.<br>
I will go there for angels food cake.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem that I have with the other board is that it loads so fast, that I am able to read the whole board in a fraction of the time that it costs me to read this one.<br>

This place taught me a lot about being a druid, and I have seen it go up and down and change many times.

Find someone to help with the Admin of this board so you don't have to deal with it.<br>
<br>
Ask EQDruids to keep this link to this board up.<br>

I don't like the way the other board works, after posting on it off and on for a while now its just not very good IMO. IN fact its down right confusing at times, the icons don't work right, the 'threads' don't seem to sort themselves, and it has several other issues that make it just undesirable to me. It is NOT a superior product.<br>
<br>
I will visit it, just because I like to mingle and hear what people are saying, but I will spend most of my time here as long as I can, this board is much easier to use. <p>Warden of Tunare<br>

I'd like to see this stay open, and that's my two coppers. <br>

Whatever you decide, thanks for maintaining a great place for us. I've made a ton of friends here. I don't know if you realize how much enjoyment you've provided, just by setting up the board and letting it fly. Memories to last a lifetime, from the Leap of Faith to the Grove on Test, and back to Gallatin on Seventh...Thanks Matt :-) <br>

I find the EQDruids board much nicer atm due to the lack of popups, no lag, search that works, etc.  Btw - the items are marked as read by changing the folder color from pink to vanilla.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, I find many of the posts on DG very redundant.  I haven't found much need to update the FAQ because there aren't that many new posts/ideas are being brought up here.  It's rather obvious that the newbies aren't taking the time to look around at the old posts - or they're fed up with the (lack of a) search functionality.<br>
<br>
I like the EQDruids boards as a great location for posting informative posts.  The Grove definitely has more of a &quot;worn,&quot; &quot;broken in&quot; feeling though.  A lot more &quot;substance&quot; in the posts which I actually read.  From what I can see, the DG is a political forum.  The EQDruids board is becoming more informative.  After a while, I'm sure the EQDriuds board will also get it's &quot;regulars&quot; and I'm sure the political commentary will appear there as well.<br>
<br>
I don't think keeping both of them would detriment the druid community much.  You'll just see a lot of cross posting.  I do think the EQDruids board will get more newbies coming through, just due to the fact that it's a hell of a lot easier to give out the www.eqdruids.com URL than pub13.blahblahblah.com/bdruidsgrove.....  There will always be msgboard trolls like myself who'll visit both.  Like I said earlier, though, I like the EQDruid's board better atm. <p><img src="http://web2.airmail.net/naomi/amalgam/forum/forumsig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usanterre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santerre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/20/01 12:53:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back from vacation. what do you want to do?</span><hr size=1> I'll go to either place and the pop-up adds don't bother me.<br>
<br>
My primary interest here is getting fellow druids perspective on things - particularly new things that we run into after patches.  I don't think we're going to dictate where that happens, and I'm going to follow it, wherever it may be.  A lot of us hit the Safehouse as well, just for fresh input, although we probably have less to post there and more to read.<br>
<br>
I think if this place goes away, there will be 10,000 people posting "I hate being asked for SoW/Ports/Buffs" and "What specialization do I choose?" and "What Velious faction should I choose?" on EQDruids.<br>
<br>
So, Elial, I offer you no help.<br>
<br>
I can add as input that Twylight seems to play a bard a bit more than a druid nowadays as well ;)<br>
<br>
The one thing I can say is there is a lot of information hidden on this board that I reference and bump from time to time... we should make sure it gets saved.  We've already lost Samita's guide to pulling spectres in Oasis, and Xenon's guide to Fear.  Let's not lose Scirocco's "Locked Rum Box Quest" spoiler and the decent ToV info that's out there now ;) <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bria>Bria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/20/01 12:57:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back from vacation. what do you want to do?</span><hr size=1> Elial, first I'd like to thank you for this board and all of the work you have put into it for us for so long.  I lurked here for many months before finally posting, and my druid grew up with the advantage of the knowledge this board provides.<br>
<br>
This is home and I hope this board will remain here for as long as EQ is around or as long as we still want to come here to visit or ask questions or perhaps be able to answer a question for someone else.  <br>
<br>
Your family and your time constraints must come first, you have to do what's best and right for you.  I doubt that I would go to the other board should you choose to close this one.  Nothing against it other than the fact that it just isn't the DG and doesn't feel like home.<br>
<br>
Welcome home, I hope your vacation time was relaxing and enjoyable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorrun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrun</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/20/01 1:35:28 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Back from vacation. what do you want to do?</span><hr size=1> First things first Elial.. do you want to continue to run the board in your spare time?  If you want to continue running the board then there are plenty of people here who will continue to appreciate that effort.  If this turns out to be the final curtan call for the Grove as it is today, then so be it.  Lord knows you have done your part for the druids of Norrath!!  Each board has its own nice features coupled with thier own pitfalls so really all this is about is whether you want to continue running the board.  Neither board is perfect by any means.<br>
<br>
Here are a couple things that I think should be considered in the process of deciding the fate of the Grove.<br>
<br>
1) If the Grove goes bye bye, can we get a backup or transfer of data, possibly to EQ Druids but it could be anywhere.  Not neccisarily on their message board but maybe as a FAQ document or something.  That would be nice so the wheel doenst have to be reinvented over there.<br>
<br>
2) Who says the Grove cant evolve into a board for something else?  Many people here talk about playing AO or DOAC not to mention the other games after those.  Perhaps the Grove could evolve to one of those games when they come out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Either way this turns out is really fine by me.  I like both boards for different reasons and it seems alot of people feel that way as well.  It will really boil down to whether you want to continue or not and if you do, how do you want to continue based on your current interest level in EQ.  <br>
<br>
In the end, anything is possible and there are no wrong answers.<br>
