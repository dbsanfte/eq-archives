Flames licked out of the windows and archer holes along the Felwithe walls, some of which had the bodies of thier occupants hung out and painting a line of blood to the ground.<br>
The army of Felwithe was crushed, and not a single body moved, save for the lifeless twitching some corpses made as thier nerves slowly died out.<br>
Alone in the mass of bodies and strewn weapons stood the Arch Vampress of Mistmoore herself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Two days earlier, a massive assault was led against the great city of Felwithe. The enemy comprised of ghouls and zombies, a horrid array of undead creatures and imps, and a few battle trained basilisks and giant insects. The undead were nearly immune to Felwithe's archers, and even the master rangers of Kelethin who rushed to aid thier High Elven brothers and sisters fell quickly to the slow but ominous advance of the horde.<br>
They breached the inner wall, but were cut down quickly by Felwithe's strongest paladins. Sadly, when the battle seemed over, a second wave hit. This second wave housed ranks of various Dark Elven warriors, wizards, clerics, and even several Vampires. Amongst them was Mayong Mistmoore himself, leading the charge into the heart of Felwithe. <br>
The elves of Kelethin and Felwithe combined proved a difficult force to deal with, but eventually were worn down, and the survivors were forced to flee the cities to the nearby dwarven stronghold of Kaladim. The loss that was suffered was enormous.<br>
<br>
The city of Felwithe now lay in ruins, completely razed to the ground. Ghouls feasted on the corpses of the dead, filling thier bellies with the flesh of thier enemies, and the clerics were busy restoring the lives to their fallen ranks. Several dark elven acolytes of Mistmoore scavenged the field for any salvage, while the commanders of this undead horde sat comfortably in the one structure still standing - the guildhall for the Clerics of Tunare.<br>
Inside was a sacriligious sight. The sacred paintings of Tunare and the First Elves were torn down and used for firewood. Ancient relics of the First Dynasty of High Born were broken and stomped into the ground, and a large mural of Innoruuk was hung over the Holy Alter itself, forever destroying the santification this building once held for it's loyal followers of Tunare.<br>
Mayong sat at the head of a long table, his feet propped up lazily on the ancient wood. Seated next to him was Lasna Cheroon, her white skin and vicious red eyes scanning for anything that seemed interesting to her. Her long fingernails slowly raked against the wood, producing quitely scraping sounds. At the other end of the table stood Fenye, the new commander of Mayong's armies. <br>
She had came to Mayong months before, promising Felwithe to be destroyed and removed from Norrath in return for his aid. Mayong reluctantly agreed to her deal, and now that she carried out her part of the bargain, it was her turn to get what was coming to her.<br>
&quot;You are a remarkable warrior, I must admit. But you did all of this for.. tell me again.. one person?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; Fenye hissed, her eyes narrowing in a mix of frustration and hatred. &quot;There is still one left who still walks these lands. She knows not of my previous death, her adventures have taken her far from the Faydarks, and she is expected to return here soon.&quot;<br>
&quot;I thought, my lovely elf, that this one was of Mithaniel Marr, and not of Tunare? Forgive me if I'm wrong, but why would she come all the way to visit these pathetic elves?&quot; Lasna spoke with a sinister tone, almost mocking Fenye of her race.<br>
&quot;Silence that tongue, ghoul. You are not the one to question my wisdom on these matters. I know she comes here after returning from every venture. Your own scouts are more useful than you are. She left the docks of Freeport three days ago, and had you paid more attention to your information sources and less attention to keeping your rotting hide together with salt baths, then you'd know this already.&quot;<br>
&quot;There is no reason for insults, Fenye. Lasna has proven herself a formidable foe. And if you recall, it was her magic that kept those archers off you and your troops' backs on the second charge.&quot; Mayong spoke with a fatherly tone, hiding the fear of Fenye drawing her blade in anger. &quot;You would do well to keep that temper of yours under close watch, my friend.&quot;<br>
Rolling her eyes and letting out a long sigh, she reluctantly agreed, &quot;Yes, I know your magic helped us, Lasna. But my battle is not over. I've freed your estate from the elves for a long time. You can return and reclaim Unrest, or you can push the assault to the dwarven city. I doubt the gnomes would get  involved much, they are such recluse little creatures.&quot;<br>
&quot;I have not made you any promises, elf. I am here on Mayong's behalf, not yours. I came here tonight for the satisfaction of spilling long overdue blood, not helping you. However,&quot; Lasna continued, lowering her voice in a more calm manner, &quot;this same person you seek revenge against is also a long time enemy of mine. I would love to see -&quot;<br>
&quot;She's mine.&quot; Fenye interrupted.&quot;There is to be noone else involved in this. All I expect of your army is to secure the docks once she has left them and to keep the pass secure of any reinforcements while I deal with this.&quot;<br>
&quot;The docks are under close watch, Arch Vampress. Her ship is to arrive soon, and she should be here within a nightsfall. I will mobilize the army as soon as this meeting is over. You have my word, Fenye.&quot; Mayong ran his tongue over his long fangs.<br>
&quot;She will be the first and the last thing I see when she reaches Felwithe. Make sure she gets here unharmed, or what happened here tonight I will make sure happens to you and your home.&quot;<br>
&quot;There is no reason to throw threats at us, Fenye. We are here to help, as part of our deal. You are new to your new life, but here, we are .. loyal.&quot; Mayong said with a grin.<br>
Fenye rose up to her feet, her black armor began to swirl and shift with the different values of light around it, making her appear a ghostly blur to any that looked at her. She walked out of the room without so much making a sound.<br>
When the door was closed, Mayong turned to Lasna, &quot;So what do you think? Should we stay and watch this spectacle or should we take a small rest and enjoy ourselves?&quot;<br>
&quot;I think that is well in order, my lover.&quot; Lasna turned to the door, and spoke somewhat louder, &quot;Xycotl, prepare me a salt bath. And.. put some pleasure oils in the water as well. We.. I will be resting for quite awhile.&quot;<br>
The huge troll shadowknight was heard lumbering off, his footsteps making the small rubble on the ground dance across the floor.<br>
<br>
The paladin looked over her more recent treasures as the boat drew nearer to the docks of the Butcher Block Mountains. Several dwarves rushed out to tether it to the wooden pillars and make sure it was safe for the passengers to offboard the ship. <br>
Her soft, short white hair waved slightly as the gale blew across the shores. After taking a few moments to adjust to walking on land again, she set off for the next stop on her journey: Felwithe.<br>
<br>
The road was clear, not a threat along the way. Strange.. she thought to herself, there are no guards here, but no beasts wandering about. She quickened her pace a little bit, and made her way to the Pass that would take her into the heart of the Greater Faydarks.<br>
<br>
Within the hour, she was standing in front of the ruins of Felwithe. Some buildings were still burning, but the object of her attention was the lone figure standing amidst the flames.<br>
To her half-elven eyes, the figure was just a black sillouette, but it seemed strangely familiar to her. The fact that it was holding a giant black sword was no sign of peace, and she was glad she had taken the precautions to protect herself with her magic before getting close to the city. The figure began to walk closer to her, and with the fluid motion of a battled hardened valkyrie of Mithanial Marr, she withdrew her sword. The flames shot down the length of the blade, starting at the hilt, and upon her will, blazed to full strength.<br>
&quot;I should have known you were behind this,&quot; she spat out as she gripped both hands onto the sword.<br>
&quot;I can't tell you how happy I am to see you. After all these years of friendship, you still hold a bitter tongue towards me. What am I going to tell my mother? That my own friend drew a sword against me?&quot; Fenye said, still walking slowly towards her, holding her own sword in a single hand.<br>
&quot;I am ashamed to have called you a friend once.&quot; she spat back.<br>
&quot;What am I going to do with you? If it is a fight you wish, I will accept your challenge, girl, if you offer it.&quot; Fenye said with a wry smirk, letting a fang slip over her lower lip.<br>
&quot;I offer it, bitch.&quot;<br>
Instantly, a cackle of lightening shot out from behind a wall of trees and struck Fenye in the middle of her chestguard. She staggered back a few steps, her armor trailing thin wisps of smoke. &quot;Fool, I will kill you both. You were all I wanted, but one more life means nothing to me. I will dine on your blood tonight, whore!&quot; Fenye lunged after the paladin, swinging her sword in arcs that lured her into false attacks, and finally thrust the dark blade towards her neck.<br>
The blade hissed as it came close to living flesh, but the paladin's quick reflexes saved her life this time, bringing her own sword up to parry the deadly strike. The two swords, one born of purity, holiness and good, the other spawned from hatred, animosity and vengeful evil, clashed with each other in a brilliant display of blue-white sparks. The flaming sword held it's own well against the powerful dark blade, but it would be a test of skill to see who the victor of this fight would be.<br>
Locked in a hold, the two women stared at each other with pure hatred, niether one gaining on the other. Fenye brought her leg out in a sweep, catching the paladin in the back of the knee bringing them out of the lock, but both on the ground. A bolt of fire hurled past them and struck the already blackened stones of Felwithe, exploding harmlessly. A grave mistake for the druid, as Fenye could now see her second opponent, and thrust her arm towards the ally of this paladin, palm outstretched.<br>
A few quick syllables and she launched an immense blast of dark energy. The blast was strong enough to make the paladin roll over and shield her eyes from the magic, and when she looked up she saw the spell hit her friend dead on in the chest. The druid let out a scream of agony, and fell to the ground. It was too hard to see if she lived through the blast, but she had bigger concerns to tend to now. The paladin whirled around in a spin and brought herself to a crouching stance, sword held low to defend against almost any attack.<br>
Fenye rose steadily. Her dark sword glistened against the flames behind it, and with a wide wave of her free hand, Fenye cast a quick spell. <br>
Fenye's eyes began to glow a deep, almost blackened red. Her armor sprouted small spikes, with most of them on her shoulders and down the tops of her legplates. The paladin quickly slashed low, hoping to hit an ankle, but Fenye jumped over them, and into a backflip, separating them by several more feet. She reached up to her brow, and with her thumb and index finger traced along the sides of her cheek, summoning the visor to her helmet. The view port eminated a red light and she gripped her dark sword with both hands, raising it high.<br>
The paladin dove into a roll, casting a quick blindness spell at Fenye after she came into a one-knee stance. The spell bounced off her armor as easily as water slides down the skin of an elf. <br>
The two lunged at each other, thier swords swinging so wildly and fast, trying to score a killing blow. Her Fiery Defender swumg high, but was met with a quick parry from the dark blade, then she had to bring it down low to defend against the counterattack. The tip of her sword barely touched the dark sword, and it wasn't enough to stop the blow entirely. The sword cut through her armor, and  into her left thigh. Her flesh grew cold and numb, void of life as the evil blade passed through. Instantly, she fell to the ground, and Fenye walked slow circles around the fallen paladin.<br>
With a clenched fist, Fenye began to go through the gestures of a rooting spell, fastening the paladin's body to the earth. Once she was incapacitated, Fenye began to walk over to the spot where the druid last fell.<br>
The dark woods were still thick with a fog of smoke so it was hard to see, but she still managed to make out the form of a small elf - no doubt a powerful still - laying on the ground, barely moving.<br>
&quot;I know you.&quot; she said as she stepped up to the wounded druid. &quot;What an outstanding coincidence this has turned out to be. I had almost forgotten about you.&quot; Fenye pushed the blade to the center of the elf's chest, and pushed the blade between the breasts, cracking the rib cage as it plunged into her heart. The sword screeched loudly, and began to hiss as it turned a light grey. The druid arched her back and let out a long, dying scream as a wisp of blue ethereal energy - her soul - flickered out from her mouth and into the pommel jewel of the dark sword. &quot;What a weak heart you have, wench. You were never one to uphold your word, A-&quot; Fenye was cut off from a powerful stunning spell. She could hear the paladin behind her, trying to get closer to her even with a useless leg. When she had regain of her body again, Fenye whirled around only to feel a searing hot pain in her chest...<br>
<br>
The two women looked at each other. Fenye's chest pumped out blood by the pints, the blood sizzling into steam as it touched the flaming blade, but the blade was quavering. She looked further down the blade, and saw that her own dark sword had successfully gone straight through the paladin's own chestplate, much the same way she was pierced.<br>
Hatred built into the eyes of both females, and with thier last strength, they each pushed thier own blades further into the other, twisting it and trying to kill the other before they themselves died.<br>
Finally dropping to thier knees, hands still clenching thier swords in a deathgrip, they each gave one final push that made the swords protrude out the backs of each other, and fell to the ground, exhaling thier last breath together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*   *   *<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite the fight. I've never seen such an extraordinary display of power before.&quot; Mayong said, waving his hand over the crystal ball, and slipping back under the sudsy bath.<br>
Lasna slithered up next to him, watching the fading image of the two warriors dead, laying next to each other. As the image flickered out, Lasna embraced the dark elf and whispered into his ear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do love a happy ending.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A> at: 7/17/01 3:40:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utanluas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanluas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://gucomics.everlore.com/strips/gu_07162000.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Great Destroyer</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/16/01 2:11:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Final Betrayal</span><hr size=1> Nice.<br>
