And I'm with Krungle... I really cannot see why I can go to Hate or Fear once I hit 46.5, but not be allowed on a dragon raid.  Silliness!<br>
<br>
These dragons were designed when 50 was the ultimate, remember, and I bet that the first folks who took down Vox and Nagafen didn't wait until they were 49 (or 47) to try it.<br>
<br>
It's about fun, mostly, for me, not the l3wt or the &quot;success&quot; of the raid (if I and others with me had fun and learned something, then it was a success in my eyes whether the dragon dies or not -- granted it's a BETTER success if they DO die  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). <p>Tryllium Calaquendi -- Cleric of Tunare, 45th Circle<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvalazar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valazar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/11/01 3:35:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> Speaking as a non-guild player who has been on 10 Vox raids (9 successful), I find very little to object to with the current system.  I've never been refused membership on any raid I wanted to join, and I've met alot of great people from many guilds in the process.<br>
<br>
I have never walked off with any loot, but not because I didn't try.  The eyepatch would be great, but honestly I WANT the WHITE SCALE.  That White Dragonscale Cloak quest has been a goal of mine for a loooong time.  I figured from the begining that I'd have to pay my dues and contribute on many raids before I got the payoff. I don't mind.  I contribute, and some day I'll get it, that is if I don't die of old age (lvl 53) first. I started at 46 and am now about to turn 52.  I hope my lucky number turns up soon.<br>
<br>
No, most of the guilds probably cannot field the complete force of 46-52 lvl players needed to take out Vox (or Naggy), but so what?  As a social event, it gives the guild a chance to interact with other players who may be interested in joining.  Let the guild claim duplicate drops, but also let EVERYONE who Can-And-Will-Use an item roll for it.  Verant screwed us once more by putting scarce standard quest items into an EPIC quest.  An EPIC item should be harder to get than a common quest, and ...<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
  just because it's an EPIC item doesn't give the class questing for it the right to stomp all over everyone else who CaWu that item.  Take a number and get in line!!!!<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
Don't change the system, but do modify the standards for looting to be fair to all players.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to a few more good raids (and just 1 White Scale)...<br>

You can buy the white scale cloak, or even a better one.  A bard can not buy their epic.  Many bards are willing to trade a better cloak for the white scale should tell you something.  You are robbing a bard of the chance to get their epic by using the scale in that manner, when there are better items out there for your use. <br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is, that if you take the scale and turn it in for the cloak, that is one less scale that can be used for an epic.  Why not just trade the scale for a heiro cloak or another white scale cloak and give someone the opportunity to finish an epic.  Which benefits anyone who groups with that bard?<br>
<br>
To me, to use the scale for the cloak and lessen the chances for an epic on our server seems a bit selfish.  But that is just my opinion. <br>
<br>
I have been on 7 Vox raids now and have only seen the scale drop once.  So a caster could have 1 cloak which is not even the best cloak they can wear anymore, or a bard has a chance at his or her epic, which can not be replaced in any way.<br>
<br>
What seems more fair to you?<br>
<br>
It is the same with the red scale.  The red scale BP is a nice item, but there is better out there now I believe.  But both bards and warriors need that scale for their epic.  I think it is sad to use that item for anything that isn't an epic.<br>
<br>
It is sad that Verant has made the quests this way.  But isn't a one of a kind item better than an item that will be upgraded later? <p><center>

I didn't think it really warranted a response.  Yes, you can have a few people lower than 47 on a dragon raid, esp healers, &amp; still succeed.  However, the majority of the raid will be 47-52.<br>
<br>
You can always make up for lower level with good gear, to an extent.  Also, because the people that are L51, &amp; 52 will soon be levelling past the range they can kill the dragons, it seems fair to include them before a L43 that has a lot of opportunities to raid dragons yet ahead of them.  If you need more clerics, I see no reason why not to take a L44 cleric.  But if it's a choice between saying no to a L52 cleric, and taking a L43 instead, that seems wrong.  Nine levels is a LOT.  It's kinda like Venril Sathir.  You can take a L20 warrior if you want.  They just won't do much.  It's the rest of the crew that's 53+ that kills him.  Same with Nag Vox.  You can have a few people under 45, but it's the majority of the crew that's 47-52 that gets it done.<br>
<br>
Level is A LOT less critical now, due to server side filtering, but before it, it really mattered a lot, because you had a very limited number of people you could take on the raid.  If you brought too many people then, you'd lose people on the raid to LD.  As a result, it was very important to have everyone on the crew as high level &amp; as well equipped as possible.  That way, you can take fewer people, and run less risk of LD problems killing the raid. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrungleeisenguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krungle Eisenguss</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/13/01 3:30:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/krungle101/krunglepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> Adune, so lower the level and wiegh in Resist gear. Also, with your suggestion of Raid Leaders choosing some and Overseerers, or what ever you want to call them, choosing some, some lower levels will get in and the 50's will get in, too. I do have the gear and the armory. Being a Palli, at 41 our weapons skills are pretty much maxxed until post 50. Only thing that improves in that time is the gear and HP's. <br>

A level 52 with 80 unbuffed FR or CR would likely take as much AE damage as a level 45 with with 115 unbuffed FR or CR, maybe even less.<br>
<br>
I cannot think of a cloak better than a WDSC, but I do agree that the epic need of the scale should outweigh the need of a WDSC for a caster.  I would like to see a compromise made for this, perhaps as allowing casters on the scale roll with the definitive condition that the scale NOT be turned into a WDSC, but traded for one (I know Sedusar has one to trade).  I would not even discount the trade for a Heirophant's Cloak or Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch, as these have entered the economy on occasion and are on-par with the WDSC for a caster.   Then the bards on the raid should roll for the rights to the scale and be given a certain amount of time to come up with a an acceptable substitute before it passes to another bard from the raid, and eventually bards outside the raid.<br>
<br>
Mainly, I think the priority is to not let a white scale leave the world without it being part of a bard epic.<br>
<br>
I don't think the red scale should be able to turned for a BP.  There are many alternatives of varying difficulties, but I would hate to deny someone a chance at their epic for what has become a mediocre breastplate. <p><p><font face="Arial">Hawkline Monster<br>

<br>
While our skills don't increase past certain levels, your offensive and defensive abilities are tied to a formula that uses skill [and] level as variables.<br>
<br>
So essentially a level 10 (class) with a 55 1HB is still less likely to his than a level 55 with a 55 in 1HB.<br>
<br>
I'm using a very obvious difference in levels, but the factor still holds true at closer spreads in levels.<br>
<br>
As Hawkline pointed out, the same is also true of resists, your level also is a part of your resistances.<br>

<br>
When signing up for a raid, you absolutely must give your FR/CR + MR levels. Once you show up at the raid there will be one person responsible for checking everyone's equipment. If you don't have the appropriate equipment you don't get to raid. It's as simple as that. This might be painful for the raid leaders who are forced to pass over key people that they might need for that particular raid (say an extra cleric), but in the long run people will learn, and they will know not to bother signing up if they don't have the appropriate gear.<br>
<br>
A lot of people sign up for these raids with no raiding experience, no knowledge on the dragons, and nothing to show for resist gear. If you are signing up for a dragon raid it should be YOUR responsibility to at least spend 30 minutes reading up on strats and a few hundred pp on resist gear. You don't need thousands of pp to buy velium diamond rings etc...<br>
<br>
Cloak of the Ice Bear...70pp<br>
2 Silver Peridot Rings... 30pp<br>
2 Symbol of Loyalty to Vox...150pp<br>
<br>
For a 250pp you've just increased your CR by a whopping +44. Give this to everyone and it could mean the difference between winning and losing the raid. Resists will make all the difference. Get your mr + cr/fr over 120 and you will take little to no damage from AE, and you won't get feared. This _IS_ the difference between winning and losing.<br>
<br>
Old school players used to kill Nagafen with 3 groups. I see people taking 6 groups and failing!!! what are they doing wrong? ...inexperienced players with no resist gear. So much relies on resists and most raiders don't have a clue.<br>
<br>
Now... you might get a few:<br>
<br>
&quot;That's no fair. Just because I can't afford resist gear doesn't mean I shouldn't get to go&quot;<br>
<br>
.... uhh yes it does. As I showed above you can dramatically increase your resists for a few hundred pp. At level 46 you should have no problem finding a few hundred pp. Sell off a piece of your main gear if you have to. The dragon raid is more important. If you want to kill a dragon it should be YOUR responsibility to be prepared for that type of encounter. You are putting everyone else's lives at risk. You know how much it sucks to finally go on a dragoon raid and LOSE??? That hasn't happened to me, but I'm sure it would majorly suck ass.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
Make set requirements for cr/fr + mr gear. Different classes can have different requirements. This forces some people to be excluded from sign-ups until they can get the proper resist gear. This is a good thing. Everyone on the raid will be much better equipped, therefore, the raids will always succeed instead of sometimes failing. Those people who are prepared to go will have a much higher chance of getting picked. <br>
<br>
I estimate that 50% of raiders don't have the proper resist gear. That means those who do have a 100% better chance of getting picked (since there is less competition.) And those who do are the ones we should be carring about. <p><FORM>

Sometimes I hear of people not knowing how to play their character when it comes to dragon raids. Ie: bards not sure of what song to play. Wizzies not knowing when to nuke. Clerics casting complete heal when they should be using sup heal or group heal (not enough time for c heal.) Raid leaders not putting a bard in the main tank group.<br>

The forum is a wonderful idea and I for one am grateful that you are willing to delevel yourself for us.  I have never raided Vox or Naggy and have just started signing up for them very recently to no avail, Oh well.  As soon as I have some experience in dragon raids I would be happy to help you in this endeavor ).  Thank you so much you are the greatest ).<br>
