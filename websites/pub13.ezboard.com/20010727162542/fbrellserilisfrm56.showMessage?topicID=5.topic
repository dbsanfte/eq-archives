<br>
I also hear that a White Dragon Scale dropped on the raid.  If this person was not a Bard would you mind posting the name of the winner.  I would be extremely interested in trading for the Scale. I'm stalled on my Epic quest and need the White Scale to proceed further.<br>
<br>
To the winner of the Scale.  Please contact me in-game, email me at kulanae@darwinmail.net, or post here in responce if you would be interested in trading for the Scale.  I am 90 percent sure I can get a White Dragonscale Cloak to trade you for the Scale.  Let me know please.<br>
<br>
So again congratulations Drunks on your raid.<br>

Fandeeg's cleric won the scale supposedly for his cloak.  In fact he wsa very upset that he was not going to be able to role on it since the white scale cloak is the best caster cloak in the game. <br>
<br>
If Faan is using it himself then he broke the CAWU uses by roling on something for another charater and the bards that were on that raid have a right to be upset. <br>
<br>
Yes I was there.  The Drunks of Tunare wanted to let only Bards role and Faandeg's cleric was so upset they let every caster role.  But gave the 4 bards there 2 numbers in the rolls.  And most of their casters were going to re-random it to the bards if they won.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but this upsets me greatly.  Not that I didn't win the scale, but that a caster that was upset about not being able to role is not using it for his bard.  If a caster wants the cloak I am so happy for them and I encouraged casters to role on it because the cloak is an awesome item for a caster.  But to have been so upset that he couldn't role on it because he wanted the cloak then use it on his bard, to me, is a way of tricking everyone there. <p><center>

<br>
I was told when I asked that it was CAWU except if 2 books dropped then DoT was claiming the second one.<br>
<br>
What I would like to clear up is that I have not started my epic.  If I get the scale I will, if I do not I have instruments and nice weapons.  I am not being loot hungry in posting this, I am more upset by the fact that Drunks of Tunare tried to do a great thing for bards wanting the scale and by this situation were taken advantage of.  <br>
<br>
A lot of people supported the bard only rolling, and only a few casters were against it.  This cleric was one of the main people against it.  He took advantage of them by saying that he would have brought his bard if he had known bards were only going to be allowed to role (which he can't as his bard is too high level) and that casters should be allowed to roll on the item because it is the best caster cloak in the game, but then had no intention of using it with his caster in the first place.  <br>
<br>
That's what saddens me more than anything.  Another bard there last night has decided to not do anymore Vox raids and gave up on his epic quest because the greed was too much for him (sorry for the paraphrase, I couldn't remember what you said exactly).  I was one of the people telling the raid leader that he should let casters roll because the white cloak is an awesome item for casters and it is only fair, so I am definitely not posting this because I am upset that I lost it.  Just that it seems to be an unethical (or unhonorable) way to have gotten the scale.<br>

<br>
If indeed the Cleric that won the scale intends to use it for his higher level bard, this is deceit on a grand scale and should be rectified.<br>
<br>

This is one of the things I think Verant should have fixed when they started making the quests easier.  I'm not a bard myself, but I know a few who have been waiting forever to get a white scale.  <br>
<br>
One of the few ways to do it is to level up another caster/bard and win the scale from Vox.  Gorenaire rarely goes down (/rude that !*&amp;*ing dragon) so that's hardly an option.  So Faandeg has a cleric in level range for Vox raids.  He gets on a Vox raid, a scale drops and then only bards get to roll on it, then with enough convincing all casters get to roll.  I've been to raids where many casters rolled on the white scale and bards weren't given an edge like in this one. (2 numbers per bard)  So it's not like he had an unfair advantage.<br>
<br>
Very few of the scales go towards the making of a cloak anymore, I'm surprised at those that don't know that.  If a caster wins, it is used in a trade for a WSDC or a Heiro since there are so many epic-questing bards out there.  Do you rant those casters too for not using the scale to make a cloak?  They too said they'd use the scale to make one, and then traded it away to a questing bard so that they'd both benefit.  In a way, this is exactly what Faandeg did.  He won the scale as a caster, then &quot;traded&quot; it to a high level bard which happened to be his own.  Kulanae(sp?) you were looking to do the same thing, trade a cloak for the scale.  However, since the cleric and the bard are the same person, you get angry.<br>
<br>
I'm not attacking anyone personally, I just don't think you're seeing things from his perspective.  You see a whining cleric that said he'd use the scale, and won it, then gave it away.  I see a cleric and a bard playing within the stupid rules of the game to complete an epic camp...er...quest.<br>
<br>
I've always known Faandeg to be a great guy, helpful in any way he can be.  For you to try to drag his name through the mud like this is uncalled for.  I hope you realize you're attacking a good man.  <br>

I like Faandag too but I think he had an error in judgement here.  If the details are straight he went as a cleric to a Vox raid in hopes that he would win a scale.<br>
<br>
The raid leader clearly supported epics since He was only letting bards roll on said scale until Fan complained that clerics were excluded from it.  Its very possible another caster could of won then Faan and every other bard on that raid would be out of luck till the next Vox fight.<br>
<br>
I think the honorable thing would of been to honor the raid leaders first good intentions and thereby further another bard's accomplishments even though that might have excluded Faan this time.<br>

I first want to say the drunks ran a GOOD raid. <br>
<br>
I was a little disapointed with the arguing as I am sure many people were. The Drunks did their best to make if &quot;fair&quot;(i.e. for the most people). When complaints were brought up about the scale &quot;only&quot; going to bards, they listened. They acknowledged that it is something casters shoudl have a shot at. So they came up with the idea of giving bards 2 numbers and casters 1 number. To stack the deck in favor of bards even more(while still giving casters a shot) many of the drunks..and other raid members entered the roll with the sole intention of rerandoming it to only bards if they won.<br>
<br>
To the Drunks and everyone else who intended to do this .../Salute<br>
<br>
I also know some casters who did want the cloak for themselves, already had bards who would trade the scale for the cloak (and they had a right to do this ...Imho). <br>
<br>
As to who won the scale. I think the idea of CaWu was twisted in this case. While this person may be a great person normally( I don't know him/her) I remember the arguement he/she made...and it was stressed it was about how the cloak was a super item and he/she should be able to roll on it for the intention of getting a cloak. Thats the only thing that casts a cloud over the situtation. If it is going to a bard..fine...I may not like the way it happened...but its done ..and many things in this game are open to differing opinions. I just feel sorry for the bards that came and lost on the roll <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
The thing I DON'T want this to do is look negatively on the Drunks. They did an OUTSTANDING job. The raid was handled well, the loot was handled with some care ...and a want to be fair. The only thing they may be guilty of is being TOO nice and not trying to lay down the law. <br>

<br>
It would seem that a minor scandal has come out of our Vox Raid, it was never our intention that the White Scale be given to a players Alt, but unfortunately we have no control over where or how loot is used after its given out.  Our only wish was to be fair to all parties involved, both caster and bard.  This was our guilds first dragon raid and I'm afraid we were not nearly as clear on loot rules as we should have been, in the future this will of course be fixed.  I would like to thank everyone involved, our goal of slaying the dragon was accomplished and I hope you will all join us in future endeavors.<br>

Making the Kunark version of her one of the toughest dragons out there doesn't help either.  <br>
<br>
My point is, either way...if casters win or bards win, the scale goes to a bard.  I have no doubts that this occurs at least 9 out of 10 times with the scale.  If a caster should happen to win, they either rerandom it to the present bards or trade it to a higher level bard who is no longer allowed to attend Vox raids.  <br>
<br>
The only reason people are attacking Faandeg is because he won it as a caster, and gave it to his own bard.  I want to see the white scale go to bards as well, and pretty much every time it drops...it does.  Either via winning the roll or via trade.  The WSDC isn't all that great anyways, gimme a Heiro any day.<br>
<br>
I'd be more angry at Verant for putting bards in this situation than at a bard for finding a way around it.  Thanks,<br>

P.S.  All you bards out there that are leveling an alt to Vox raid level in hopes of winning a scale, best just stop now.  Apparently, people don't like your solution to this inane problem.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.  To the Drunks:  You are not at fault here, I'm sure the raid was executed wonderfully, and the loot was rolled as fairly as possible.  I'm glad to see you all doing so well, those in your guild that I've met are good people. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utypan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Typan</A> at: 5/1/01 10:18:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uimnnaru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>imnnaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/1/01 10:18:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Drunks and friends.....</span><hr size=1> You guys did an awesome not only running the raid, but also trying to be fair with the loot.

Faandeg should have contacted the Drunks prior to the raid and explained his situation.  He would have run the risk of them refusing his request to roll on the scale with all the other bards, but given their attitude towards epic help, I seriously doubt that would have been the case.  But that is in the past, hindsight is, as usual, much clearer.<br>
<br>
Now that the damage is done, I ask you...what damage was it?  Did he have a right to roll on the scale, alongside the other bards and casters?  Yes.  Did he roll under CaWU rules, stating that he would use and not trade away that scale?  Yes.  Did he fail to abide by those rules?  No, he's gonna use the scale himself, albeit for a slightly different purpose than another cleric would have done?  So was CaWU broken?  No.  Did the scale go to a deserving person?  Yes.  Did it go towards a noble goal?  Yes.  <br>
<br>
His only mistake was misleading the raid on how the loot he won would be used, but as long as you *do* use it, who cares.  Would you frown on someone passing a CaWU won item on to their twink once they got better?  In my opinion, he earned and deserves the scale, though... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarksydodymoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darksyd Odymoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/1/01 11:26:06 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Congratulations to Drunks and friends.....</span><hr size=1> What if he got a WDSC to give to his own cleric in exchange for the scale?

<br>
Bards on this server are a fairly tight bunch.  We try to help each other as best we can with songs, advice, epic help, etc.  I think there is nothing wrong with a Bard leveling up a caster and using said character to compete for a White Scale.  However, it needs to be done with full disclosure to the raid and the other Bards.<br>
<br>
What really irks me is if Faandeg had spoken with the other Bards on the raid and informed them of what he was doing, I can almost guarantee they would have given him an equal shot at the scale right alongside them.  The problem was Faandeg did not let others know.  Probably no one would have known if I had not talked to a Drunks member to determine who the winner was and if Katran had not posted that he got a tell from Faandeg.<br>
<br>
That is the real issue.  That the other Bards on the raid, and the raid in general, seems to have been deceived. I would really like to hear Faandeg's comments on this issue. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

However, he *also* didn't take the bard's odds on the scale either.  The bards got 2 numbers, he got 1.  He could've said &quot;I need the scale for my bard!  I should get 2 numbers too!&quot; but he didn't.  He took the odds given the caster he was playing and won.<br>
<br>
From that point on, it is his scale.  He may use it to make a cloak, or trade it to a bard for whatever he needs.  It just so turns out the bard he traded it to was himself.  I'm as curious as Darksyd about that, would you feel better if he obtained a WSDC and put it on his cleric to complete the trade?<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that the loot rules on the scale were not set before the raid began.  Had the rules been stated beforehand that only bards would get to roll, Faandeg may have mentioned the fact that he would like to roll for his bard who is unable to attend the raid.  Since they weren't, he went with the odds that he was given.  Congratulations Faandeg on attaining this envied/hard-to-get epic piece.  Can't wait to see your sword sing.<br>

From the information presented, if Faandeg's Cleric wouldn't have been complaining the Scale would only have been randomed to the Bards present and he would not have had a chance at all. Now let me ask you this, if Faandeg would have been level approriate for this raid would he, as his Bard, have made the same arguement to include casters? If the answer is no....then he shouldn't have been making that arguement as a Cleric. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">
