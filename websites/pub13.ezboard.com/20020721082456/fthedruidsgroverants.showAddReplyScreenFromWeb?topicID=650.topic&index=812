(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> One more time so the slow druids get it. You must be balanced in regard to other classes. You cant change spell lineups without affecting player balance. This was about defining the druid BGH status I thought? So if these spells will be more group oriented than raid oriented what the hell is the point other than to undermine the abilities of other classes? Sodium you are making my point, you dont care that these spells will be making grouping easier than they will gain you a foothold in raiding (which druids already HAVE). <br>
<br>
Clerics need to be more desireable in groups because we dont have another option, DUH. Cleric offensive output is lower than an ENCHANTERS for gods sake. <br>
<br>
CH mitigates : DoTs, Snare, Ports, fire and cold DD and debuffs for fire, Disjunction, evacs, invis, levitate, rain spells, ranged AE, and damage shields AND being able to heal as well as the specialist class minus CH? Wow, where do I sign up?<br>
<br>
As far as the fear mongoring goes, I dont see you asking for a increase in healing powers across the board, simply for druids. And in the same post you declare that you think CH justifies any healing upgrade Druids ask for. Ludicrous.  Every time someone brings up Verant's track record with clerics, druids  again reiterate that this isnt about clerics but you are sure Verant will help us out. Circular reasoning is not an argument its an excuse for not being able to think.<br>
<br>
It wont help you that much on raids....as in being raid desireable...it wont...Clerics will still be the top demand healer. Druids will solidly be in the slot of backup healer. They also will completely own exp groups aside from CT and Ssra where CH is required to get anywhere effeciently. <br>
<br>
Leaves you with a class that can solo effectively, raid effectively and group MORE than effectively. So, um what would your weakpoint be again? Because every other class gets one. Its called trade-offs. <br>

<br>
&quot;You cant change spell lineups without affecting player balance.&quot;<br>
That is the whole idea! To balance by changing the spell lineups. We seem to agree here on everything except the point weather druids and clerics are balanced with respect to end game groups/raids.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clerics need to be more desirable in groups because we don't have another option, DUH&quot;<br>
End game. END GAME. Druids here do not buy the argument that druids shouldn't be nearly as desirable as clerics in the end game scenario because they can solo.  To participate in the end game groups/raids every class needs to be nearly as desirable as another, and druids fall short in the END GAME grouping/raids.<br>
<br>
&quot;CH mitigates : DoTs, Snare, Ports, fire and cold DD and debuffs for fire, Disjunction, evacs, invis, levitate, rain spells, ranged AE, and damage shields AND being able to heal as well as the specialist class minus CH?&quot;<br>
Again, no druid here buys the argument that druids shouldn't be nearly as desirable as clerics in the end game scenario because druids can solo. You ignore the simple facts about just how useful any cleric is to the end game groups/raids. You ignore simple facts about membership requirements of High end guilds. <br>
I am not DoTing during the high group/raid end game, I am to watching people die in the futile pursuit of trying to keep people alive with my heals. I do not snare, that is not my job in the high end group/raid end game, and many classes mave this ability. Levitate and invis in the end game group/raid, don't make me laugh. Evacs are superceded by REZ and has been since clerics obtained 90-96%  rezzing. Druid damage shields are not used in the high end group/raid end game. On top of this, druids are a leather class, clerics are a plate class. Clerics get mana regen, as druids do. Clerics get get a ton of the best buffs in the game. Clerics can blast for a decent amount if need be (though not as well as a druid), can get equipment to emulate many druid abilities, have free armor heals. You ignore the dominance clerics have enjoyed in end game grouping/raids and show your envy/ignorance of the druid ability to solo non-end game mobs (downtime, the danger involved, the actual amount of experience gained, the time involved as opposed to the time and safety gained in a group).<br>
<br>
&quot;I dont see you asking for a increase in healing powers across the board&quot;<br>
This is a druid petition, not a cleric petition. Make your own petition/counter-petition.<br>
<br>
&quot;And in the same post you declare that you think CH justifies any healing upgrade Druids ask for.&quot;<br>
Again, the high end game was designed with CH in mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ludicrous. Every time someone brings up Verant's track record with clerics, druids again reiterate that this isnt about clerics but you are sure Verant will help us out. Circular reasoning is not an argument its an excuse for not being able to think.&quot;<br>
Fear-mongering. Write your own petition/counter-petition.<br>
<br>
&quot;Druids will solidly be in the slot of backup healer. They also will completely own exp groups aside from CT and Ssra where CH is required to get anywhere effeciently. &quot;<br>
Yawn. See above.<br>
<br>
&quot;Leaves you with a class that can solo effectively, raid effectively and group MORE than effectively. So, um what would your weakpoint be again? Because every other class gets one. Its called trade-offs.&quot;<br>
Trade offs huh? raid more effectively? group more effectively? than clerics? Funny. Again, druids here do not buy the argument that druids shouldn't be nearly as desirable as clerics in the end game groups/raids because they can solo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uverylowsodium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VERY LOW SODIUM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/24/02 3:15:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=816>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> 100011101011</span><hr size=1> Also, my druid has not signed this petition.

<br>
What of the above is so damn hard to understand?! Can you druids hammer that into your head? I dont give a damn it your petition is about ONLY raiding Vex Thal in SoL and you dont think you can do a good job!!! ANYTHING you ask for is needed to be balanced OVER THE COMPLETLY &quot;#¤=)/&quot;#¤=)/ GAME IN RAIDING POWER AND IN EXPING. Or did I miss something here, are you saying that EVERY druid that dings 60 suddently goes of and ONLY do &quot;high end&quot; raiding (still waiting for a definition of it btw, as some start saying we need AoE heals to heal, really then show me the AoE on AoW or Tunare, or Max or Burrower beast etc you want to heal, that is high end is it not? Or tell me how much use your new dot will be on in &quot;high end encounters&quot;, you said this petition was ONLY about highend raiding) and therefor so is ANY upgrades acceptable as they will NEVER risk to affect anything else? <br>
<br>
 Any changes suggested will have effect in raiding and exping all over the line. From the level 60 druid who soloed to 60 to the druid in Triton who plays in Vex Thal and everything there between. Not all druids will enter Vex Thal, not all druids will even do Tunare, AoW, or enter ToV, yet so will ANY changes affect them also. Any changes WILL affect the raiding and exping and I dont give a damn if you keep repeating this is about high end raiding because EVERYONE will one time or the other return to do exp. If nothing else to regain the lost exp on deaths. So the next one who repeat this is ONLY about high end raiding and the rest of the game got NOTHING to do with what they suggest think two times before typing. This petition WILL affect other parts of the game if you like it or not.<br>
