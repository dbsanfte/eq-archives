Having never played a paladin before that point I thought it was as good a name as any for one and made an experiment out of it. And now, some 6 years later he's my favorite character of all time and has been in NWN, The Realm, Lords of Empyria, UO, Asherons Call, and eventually became a King.  <BR>  <BR> So anyway, that's my story. <BR>  <BR> Centruoicles Sculpturatus <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Caerwynn</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/9/00 7:52:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Names</span><hr size=1> Well my first name Caerwynn is actually my first name in old Celt.

I started playing EQ on a friends account for a little while, and of course I was an Erudite paladin.  My name was Kadacor, it was just something that I had pulled out of my a**.  I then decided to purchase EQ and pick a more interesting name.  Again, I went digging and came up with Kanazul.  I think that they name had a certain ring to it and it has stuck.  <br>
As to my last name, I had plenty of time to think of one, since it took me almost 7 months to get to lvl 20.  One day I was listening to a CD of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and they started listing off the brothers names.  Isacaar(pronounced is-a-car) kinda fit the mold and sounded like it fit, so that is why I chose it.  I haven't had the RP past of many of you, but it is my name none the less.<br>
<br>
The most powerful thing in the world is your name, if someone knows it, they can control you in many ways.  Just remember that and always keep the honor associated with your name. <p>Kanazul Isacaar

<br>
I kind of wish at times i had gone with my first instinct, Treelo. But hay most of the time we have no real choice what people will call us anyway.  <br>
<br>
as i advanced i thought alot about what my last name would be.  I had many sugestions from friends.  some of the ladys I know thought i should be Treeno Daddy.  I had a bit of a rep. for traveling with alot of ladys and was refered to as Treeno the Pimp Paladin.  or just T.  <br>
<br>
But when i made level 20 i felt Treeno had come around he would stay out of the bars and away from sultry wemon.  He became focused on Quellious.  and there for his last name would show his higher calling.  I am not quite positve what my last name meens but i think i am close when i say Delsolas meen Son of the Stars, or the heavens.<br>

Theres also a prince in the Star Wars series named Isolder but other than that the name is completely unique <img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><br>
<br>
don't know why but a lot of people can't pronounce it =\<br>
just say this real fast:<br>
is-ull-door<br>
<br>
Also I tend to keep the i in lowercase when I write it because people think its an L    &gt;=\<br>
now if I can just pick a last name...<br>

Pankration is the ancient greek art of martial arts and former ancient Olympic Sport. I am half Greek in RL, and have been practicing Martial Arts for about 4 years now. I started in Jujitsu and most recently have been training in &quot;Submission Wrestling&quot;. This is wrestling with goal of submitting your opponent rather than pinning him. Submission is usually accomplished via a &quot;submission&quot; hold, ie putting pressure on a joint to the point of breaking it, or applying a choke hold. Basically your opponent has 2 options, submit or have the joint broken/hyperextended or pass out from the chokehold. Submissions are gained by first wrestling to an advantageous position, and then applying the &quot;hold&quot;. Pankration combines this form of wrestling with a combination of hand, feet, elbow and knee strikes, as well as throws. It is a complete martial art, very similar to the hybrid styles you see emerging in the Ultimate Fighting Championship and other mixed martial arts events. Well, for those of you who cared, there it is... :-).<br>

<br>
Long before I began playing EverQuest I use to play(and still do, just not as often)AD&amp;D.  Well, in one adventure I developed, I created an NPC, a Silver Dragon, whos name was...Lady Shiarnu Velestra, she took on the form of a female High Elf Paladin to aid the adventureers where she could.  So, when I started EQ, it seemed only fitting that should take my NPC from AD&amp;D and transport her here.  *Waves at Jiae*<br>

All my life it seems as tho some form or symbol of a lion has always been there. Courageous &amp; Powerful, and VERY protective <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->  Fits the way I try and live my Life, from the youth to the now. I've had everything from Lion stuff animals to a Basic Training company, &quot;Black Lions&quot;. After yelling that for 2 months straight, it kinda doesn't leave too easily, so I started my ICQ and battlenet names with that, ~Black~Lion~. Only later did I come to find it was also a name for a Japanese Anime movie, which I also have always loved(the anime, havent seen the movie, YET) Alas, I tried to get that name but it was rejected. Sooo... I tried a few diferent variations, and thought of &quot;Thelion&quot;. To this day I still get questions of whether &quot;The-Lion&quot;, or &quot;Thel-ion&quot;. *chuckles*<br>
<br>
The surname came quickly, probably within an hour of the petition. From the top of my head, which is where all the best comes from (fresh picked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> ). Still would love to have gotten a screenshot of the surname, back when I was fighting to get a &quot;Sir&quot; cuz I had figured out the test of truth quest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>

Very fun.<br>
<br>
 Back when I knew GM's willing to run D&amp;D there was one guy brave enough to tackle the new strategy game component, Birthright. Oddly enough, before this I had not been able to play an Elven Paladin. D&amp;D just didn't allow it (and few GM's did until DragonLance came out) for the most part. <br>
 <br>
 Well, I tried my hand with a Human Paladin in Talinie but it didn't pan out and I wasn't happy with it. So I looked at the elven areas and found that, yes, I could play an Elven paladin! But what lovely surna,e could go with the Birthright's family name in Tuahievel of Tuarlachiem? So off I go pouring through the Silmarillion in hopes of finding a few Quenya syllables to put together. Just didn't happen. I had been so fluent and skilled in putting names together for elves, loving to play them as I did, but this time it didn't come from Tolkien. I wanted something from my own mind. Finally, the name Calleighn came from inside somewhere. Lyrical, a couple L's a few vowels mixed harmoniously together and best of all. I was my very own original name! =)<br>
<br>
 When I found I could play a High-Elven Paladin on EQ, I went right back to Calleighn for my inspiration. It was accepted with no problems and even though the last name was not original, I like to think of it as a memory for my inspiration returning. Hence I will always have something new and something old. Very appro-po for an Elf, I think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP--> <br>
