I have no problem with someone making a good product and making a boatload of money - that's the American way, and I applaud for anyone who does it.  However, when that boatload of money comes from shamming the public with shoddy products that they have no choice but to buy, then there's a problem.<br>
<br>
Office XP, and the forthcoming Windows XP have new installer technology in it, which requires a hash key in order to run.  This hash key is generated when you install the product for the first time and can not be re-generated without contacting microsoft.  However, it must be re-generated if you change hardware configurations because it ties your hardware configuration to the hash key.<br>
<br>
Now, let's say I have a hard drive crash on a Friday night (I do work nights and weekends btw).  I break out my CD's to recover and I can't install a product that *I paid for* because I can't get through to tech support for 3-4 days.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing I hate is that Microsoft tries to be everything to everyone and fails.  Every one of their programs wants to have a high degree of control over your system, but they don't even work well with other Microsoft programs in some cases.<br>
<br>
I program a lot.  I use Visual Studio to work in C++.  Version 5 of Visual Studio required that you have IE 3.0 on your system.  If you had a later version, it OVERWROTE it with 3.0 (without asking).  Then I installed another program, which required version 4.0 of IE and installed it over 3.0 (again without asking).  Meaning I couldn't use Visual Studio any more without reinstalling it, which then broke my other program.  It was a vicious cycle.<br>
<br>
Every version of Office has bugs - some bugs in Excel have caused me to lose work more than once before I figured a way around.  Yet these bugs are never fixed.  New versions of Office come out (for a hefty upgrade fee) almost every year, yet there are bugs that I've been fighting since Excel version 2.0.<br>
<br>
Every version of Windows has more security holes than the last, but rather than fixing it, Microsoft doles out another version of Windows with a few new bells/whistles.  All the while hackers are merrily going about their business exploiting those security holes and trashing people's home systems and hacking web servers.<br>
<br>
As someone in this thread said earlier, WinME is a piece of crap.  But just try to buy a new computer that doesn't have it pre-installed.  I bought a laptop last fall and shopped around extensively.  It was *physically impossible* to buy a Windows laptop that did not have ME installed.<br>
<br>
A few years ago, every Microsoft product came with an extensive manual (usually hundreds of pages), and a toll-free number to call for support, which connected you with someone who knew how to use the product and was quite helpful.  Also, the help files were detailed and useful.<br>
<br>
Today, new Microsoft software comes with a 20-page manual, virtually no help files (or worse, the help files for older versions of the product) and a 900 number you can call for beaucoup bucks to get to talk to support people who know less than you do about the program.<br>
<br>
Do I use Microsoft products?  Yes, unless there is a viable alternative.  In most cases there isn't a viable alternative though, because they've run the competition out of business through their tactics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/01 6:09:58 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/rtfm.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More bug stuff</span><hr size=1> Khieran says:  <b><i>However, when that boatload of money comes from shamming the public with shoddy products that they have no choice but to buy, then there's a problem.</b></i><br>
<br>
You have no choice but to buy Windows?  Why can't you download Linux and StarOffice and all that stuff?<br>
<br>

<br>
Name me one copy-protection scheme which ISN'T annoying.  Besides, I don't think you fully understand the way the system works, because even though you are required to reactivate after you change one of the key hardware pieces (not the hard drive), you can still run the OS for a limited time before reactivation.  I know this was discussed at length at some of the hardware benchmarking sites who were concerned about this exact issue, so maybe I can dig up a link if you're really interested.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Every version of Office has bugs </b></i><br>
<br>
The following is a complete list of bug-free software introduced in the past 10 years:<br>
<br>
1) Ummmm .... uhhh ... Everquest?  :)<br>
<br>
<b><i>Every version of Windows has more security holes than the last, but rather than fixing it, Microsoft doles out another version of Windows with a few new bells/whistles.</b></i><br>
<br>
Win2K/NT/XP is "bells/whistles"?  And it's less secure than Win98?<br>
<br>
<b><i>All the while hackers are merrily going about their business exploiting those security holes and trashing people's home systems and hacking web servers.</b></i><br>
<br>
And other operating systems have no security holes?  *ahem*<br>
<br>
<b><i>As someone in this thread said earlier, WinME is a piece of crap. But just try to buy a new computer that doesn't have it pre-installed.</b></i><br>
<br>
So?  Install another OS if you don't like Windows.  You're basically getting Windows for free, why does this bother you?<br>
<br>
<b><i>Today, new Microsoft software comes with a 20-page manual, virtually no help files (or worse, the help files for older versions of the product) and a 900 number you can call for beaucoup bucks to get to talk to support people who know less than you do about the program.</b></i><br>
<br>
On the other hand, Microsoft has one of the best automated update utilities on the Internet.  Far more useful to me than those manuals I always threw away.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Do I use Microsoft products? Yes, unless there is a viable alternative. In most cases there isn't a viable alternative though, because they've run the competition out of business through their tactics. </b></i><br>
<br>
You use the term "viable alternative" in the abstract, but realistically, what specific "viable alternatives" were there which were (a) better than the Microsoft product and (b) run out of business by Microsoft?  In other words, what product did you use in the past, but can't use now solely because Microsoft doesn't allow you to? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueridalafar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eridalafar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/01 7:09:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More bug stuff</span><hr size=1> Tudamorf  say:<br>

Tudamorf  say:<br>
<br>
Win2K/NT/XP is &quot;bells/whistles&quot;? And it's less secure than Win98?<br>
<br>
Hum, it a wrong comparaison, Microsoft have 2 lines of os:<br>
<br>
1- dos -&gt; windows 3.11 -&gt; windows 95 =&gt; windows 98 -&gt; windows ME<br>
<br>
2- Windows NT (first developped with IBM) -&gt; windows 2000 -&gt; windows xp<br>
<br>
To compare the two line is like to compare apples whit computers.<br>
<br>
Tudamorf  say:<br>
So? Install another OS if you don't like Windows. You're basically getting Windows for free, why does this bother you<br>
<br>
False, I pay a price for it, less that if I buy it from shell, but it price IS in the computer price, it not realy free.<br>
<br>
Tudamorf  say:<br>
run out of business by Microsoft? In other words, what product did you use in the past, but can't use now solely because Microsoft doesn't allow you to? <br>
<br>
Nope, but the other product isn't integred with office, it harder to make some presentation when you have hard time to import the document from the other product and it isn't incopored in more that complete office version. (EH, it do the job (even if it do the job in a less effecient way)).<br>
<br>
True no software are come whitout bug, but some have come near. Their are also the mater the time to produce a patch for fixing the bug to consider. If a bug last for more that 2 weeks in linux, it is a big bug.<br>
<br>
Also the comitement to make this patch is important. I have a bug in NT4 that Microsoft have say it will be fixed in the service pack 7, I don't think it will be a service pack 7, it more go for windows 2000 (or windows XP soon) song.<br>
