<br>
It is with great....angst, that I write these words, but I feel I must do so, in hopes that someday, possibly, I will be remembered...<br>
<br>
I have many regrets in my life, and undoubtedly, if this letter has been found, that life is over....<br>
<br>
This was my life....<br>
<br>
Born in Greater Faydark to a failing family of wood elves, Rroalif, and Osmosis, my mother and father, raised me the best they knew. I had a sister, Graymatter, who left home at an early age, to find a more prosperous location in which to live. That was many seasons ago, and I've yet to hear from her even at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Life was not difficult for me, for even though we were poor, dad had alot of friends, and being a ranger, I found odd jobs tracking for the guards and nobles, sold the foraged food I had to get by. The homefront wasn't always the best atmosphere for a young elf, for even though we were a proud family, dad had been wounded many seasons before by the infamous Ambassador Divinn, and hadn't been able to walk since. Mom, a veteran brewer and baker, sold her wares in order to keep the family housed,and we did ok.<br>
<br>
<br>
One day, a messanger arrived at our door, with a note from a headmaster in quenos, it appeared that word of my mothers' famous cooking had earned her the privilidge of catering a wedding of nobles in Quenos! Such an event would surely put her on the map and in turn, could turn the overwhelming feeling of sadness my father had around. Not being in good health, my father was unable to accompany her,and if he'd known that he'd never see her alive again, I'm sure he would have kissed her goodbye that morning...<br>
Being the loyal son that I am, I agreed to help mother make her way there. We purchased 2 sows from Leith, a promising young druid, and made our way. The trek was long and mercifully, uneventful. That is until we reached West Karanas, where our troubles began. The dangers of Norrath are ever present, and as my father always said, &quot;These lands have teeth, and they are never afraid to bite.&quot; That night, in West Karanas, bite they did. Clean through. The ghoul messanger, on his way to deliver a note to some undisclosed location, crossed us on the path accross from a small hut. He attacked mother immediately, and despite my yells for help, no one was around. After finishing mother, he turned to me. My first thought was &quot;not without my mother&quot;. I tried picking her lifeless body up to carry, but alas, it was too heavy, and the messanger was too nimble. He lunged at me, and I fled. If it werent' for the gracious healing bestowed upon me by a young barbarian named Kedina, I would not have lived past that night. Thank you Kedina, for surely you are remembered.<br>
<br>
The trip home was horrible. Many thoughts came to mind along the way, how to tell dad what had happened, how to get word to quenos, as to not ruin my mothers name, etc... Along the way, in a place called highpass hold, I was detained. A young necromancer named Gremley was wounded just inside the main road in from East Karanas, so I healed him, even though I'd been told since day one that necromancers were nothing short of evil, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some fascination with the occult and it's wonderous lifestyle. Gremley and I became friends, and I stayed for a long while. <br>
<br>
In that time, I made many new friends, too numerous to mention really, good people of all races and classes. Some who were incredibly intimidating at a glance, but were indeed friends once I took the time to know them.<br>
<br>
<br>
The time had come for me to venture home, to inform my dad of what had became of me, as I'm sure he had been informed by this time of the circumstances surrounding my mother's demise. So, I took the journey home, in a reflective mood, seeing sights that I hadn't seen in ages, the dark forest of Kithicor, the warm desert of ro, the corrupt city, the beautiful ocean of tears, and finally, my beloved continent. I stopped by a tavern in Kaladim and had some drinks with some old friends, and then went home.<br>
<br>
<br>
The grief which hit me when I looked upon the place where I last saw my father can not be put down on paper. The house was no longer there, only scarred remains of my former home. I dropped to my knees and cried.<br>
<br>
I learned from a friend, a bard named Vast, that only a week earlier, the Goblin Lord had sent his minions into greater faydark to slay the one who was known as Seprentor, for reasons unknown. When the tidal lord came into my fathers home, he only saw my father, and not being of high intellect, mistook him for me. I'm sure my father put up a valiant fight, but in his weakened condition, died in the end.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enraged, I stormed out of Kelethin, en route to a place I had only been told about, Dagnor's Cauldron....The home of the tidal lord. Along the way, I spent every copper I had saved to have magics cast upon me so I would have more strength, more agility, more stamina, anything that would help me in my quest. Silveroze, an old friend from the past, offered to help, but I turned her down, as I knew this would be a suicide mission, to avenge the death of my father, and come to terms with what I had come to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Twas not difficult finding the beast, he was riht where I'd been told by Aenie, the great wizardress, that he'd be. Luckily for me, he was alone, and resting. I began to cast a spell....<br>
<br>
<br>
The fight was over in less that a heartbeat, as there were many goblins lurking about that weren't about to see their master be slain by a petty ranger of my standings. I was hit, again and again. With a constant chill deep inside, I realized this was the end for me. No avenging my fathers death, no finding a suitable wife, no more late night drinking binges with friends, just death, and nothing more. <br>
<br>
As I fell to the ground, bleeding to death, I heard the words of an old necromancer rise above the howls and screams of the goblins, &quot;Seprentor, nevermore!&quot; he cackled, and then proceeded to slay the goblins with one mighty cast. He was a friend of Gremley, the ill fated necromancer i had became friends with in highpass, come to my rescue. I turned to thank him for his deeds, even though truth be known, I'd rather have died right then and there, but he was gone. I crawled my way to the tent the goblins had been near,as it had started raining. By divine right, i took &quot;Nevermore&quot; as a surname on that spot, to stand for how many more times i would take the evil that these creatures push upon us.<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun is setting as I write this. The battle, only a few moments old, has left me greatly wounded and despite the fact that the goblins are dead, I may never return to Kelethin, as this will very well be the sight of my death. If this note is found with me beside it, please bury me on this spot, as I want a marker to be put up on behalf of my parents and my long lost sister. If this note is found and I am not by it, who knows? Perhaps I'll run into you in Norrath one day....<br>
