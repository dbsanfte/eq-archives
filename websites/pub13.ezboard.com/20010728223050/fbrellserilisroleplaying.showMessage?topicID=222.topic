All manner of corruption and suffering could be found in these gloomy slums when the warm sun had hid her face from the world. Gathered shadows about me I moved, quietly alert, stalking, held in the care of the crisp night air.<br>
<br>
Shouting and commotion from behind the tall wooden weathered tavern of the Chops and Hops Inn drew my attention. Upon closer investigation I found a man, relentlessly kicking and shouting vehemently at a women on the ground at his feet. She wept, sobbing, and occassionaly shrieking as she desperately tried to protect her soft body with her arms and drawn up legs.<br>
&quot;B*tch&quot; He spat, his voice slurred by heavy drink. &quot;I was gonna pay you! You stole my coin filthy Wh*re I want it back! You hear me?&quot; He resumed kicking her again. <br>
&quot;I don't have it anymore, Please!&quot; She wept desperately beseeching him for mercy. He shouted yet louder with growing rage, directing more hot profanities at her and redoubling his efforts. I purposefully stepped from the shadows.<br>
<br>
In a moment he ceased, turning his head to me. He wore a scruffy beard of a few days, and loose unkempt leather armor, a rapier rattling at his side. His eyes dull from the effects of liquor, began to clear, and his face dropped as I pulled back my hood. The girl at his feet scurried to a corner, wide eyed, one hand pressed to her mouth. In an instant he decided to move, reaching for his rapier. My magics tore through his body, robbing him of his strength. Enveloping him in darkness I clasped him to me with my newly gained strength stolen from him. He was like a struggling babe in my grip as I drank his spirit from him. His life essence fed me, easing my malady, and breaking my fever. I dropped him to the ground in a heap with little care or ceremony. <br>
<br>
Stepping over his sprawled out body I neared the girl crouching in the corner of the alley. She was half elven, likely a whore as he stated. All that taken into account, she still was yet beautiful. I regarded her with icy eyes, staring down into her tear stained features. She was weak, afraid, trembling. I held my black soft gloved hands out to her. One leg was badly wounded and she would not stand without assistence. Warm tears spilled down her face as I helped her to her feet. She was afraid yet mesmerized by me, perhaps by my cool indigo exquisite features and my icy piercing eyes. I pulled her forward into my embrace, slowly drinking in the essence of her spirit. I had mastered the ability to painfully tear life from another, or coax it out, even pleasurably. I ran my hands over her soft full curves as I held her, making love to her in a manner, as I annointed myself in her spirit. She rasped softly, having given herself over to me as I quietly consumed her. I kissed her fine jaw line, her neck, above the swell of her breasts. Limp in my grip she was almost dead, and quite aroused. I pressed her too me and sighed as I poured some of my spirit into her with my empathetic magics. I gave her back, she, combined with me. She tensed rasping hotly as she ran her fingers through my white silver hair, trembling, peaking. I eased her slowly to the ground. I dropped my face near to hers listening to her softly breathe. I caressed her face delicately, I brought my full dark lips down to hers. I felt ecstacy wash through me in turn as she gave herself up to me. As my lips parted from hers one last sigh of life escaped her.<br>
I moved a dark gloved hand over her face, quietly shutting her empty violet eyes.<br>
<br>
As left her there I stepped over the Brigand pausing. He had the smallest spark of life in him. With a maledict curse I smote him with a cruel wasting disease. Oh he would die, but his suffering would be great..... and lengthly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udannyzrc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DannyZRC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/9/01 2:40:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Annoiting of Spirit/*Zeerith Rp*</span><hr size=1> nice! <p><FONT SIZE= "3" <B> Quellren Mexsachine, Level 50 Enchanter </B> <BR> Samphera Wraithenwind, level 36 Magician <BR>
