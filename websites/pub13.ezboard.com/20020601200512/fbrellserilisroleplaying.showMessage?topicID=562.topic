*****************************************<br>
<br>
        Blurain ran shrieking from under the waterfall into the trout pond and onto the shore by Niera Farbreeze, a small bear cub fast catching up to her. She tumbled down onto the grassy hill dripping wet and panting with glee at having succeeded in whisking the small bundle of fur away from its mother. Settling down to business she began to instruct the small cub giving him bits of foraged berries for a job well done.<br>
         <br>
Niera, normally a quite and reserved human warrior, walked over to where the pair had settled down. Looking down her nose at the child she began, what seems to have become a common lecture “What is this you’ve done Blu?! Return that poor cub to his mother before she has a fit and starts tearing into the place looking for him. How would you feel if your baby had been carried off by a stranger, eh young one?” <br>
        <br>
“But Ni!, I didn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> carry</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> him off, he followed me.” rationalized Blu, some what exasperated with the reaction to her success. “He’s charmed! Bears are far to stubborn to follow me around and do tricks for berries. Isn’t it wonderful, watch he knows how to sit, and beg.” Before Niera could get a word in other wise, Blurain reached into her pocked for a berry, gave the command, and smiled from ear to ear as he slowly sat back on his haunches and reached one paw in the air waving it around while making little imploring noises. <br>
          <br>
“CROS!” shouted Niera across the glade, taping her foot impatiently she waited for the old druid to make his way over. “Cros, look, she’s your responsibility. You have got to teach her some manners! She’s gone and charmed one of the bear cubs and taught it how to beg, BEG! One of our bears is being trained for the circus!” throwing her hands in the air, Niera stormed off.<br>
         <br>
Trying to hide the amusement from his eyes Cros put on his most serious face and quickly canceled the magic Blurain had set upon the bear cub. Before he had a chance to calm it down the wee beast swatted Blu with its paw, drawing blood from her ankle, turned and headed home. “Now look Blu,” began Cros “Ya cant just go about charming whatever ya like. Speaking of which where on earth did you find the scrolls on that one? I thought Holly had locked up her store of books after your last escapade.” Before Blu could answer he was off again with the lecture again, “Never mind, I don't want to know. Child ya know we all love ya dearly here at the glade but if you cant learn some restraint they are going to ask that you be sent elsewhere. Your almost old enough as is to be sent off to a higher druid order. Lord knows you‘ve got the powers, but you need to learn to control it, or it will take control of you.” <br>
         <br>
Motioning her to follow Cros headed out of the glade to the shore of the lake. Settling down on the hill side, Cros just stared out over the lake for a good while before he could muster the will to speak what was in his mind.<br>
        <br>
“Blurain, you’ve known from the start that your none of our get. I found you out here after one of the worst storms I’ve ever seen in my life.” Cros waved his hand for Blu to be quite when she began to speak over him. “Hush and listen, I’ve needed to get this off my chest for a while, its only right that ya know. The other druids would have ya never know how you got here, knowledge like that can make one swell in the head, and think too highly of oneself. It can corrupt.<br>
        <br>
“You’ve know from the start that you didn't quite fit in, you have always been an outsider here, even among the half elf's who’s homes are open to anyone. You don't even begin to look like your other half elf sisters and brothers. The closest any of us have been able to figure is that your part High elf, its really the only way to explain the coloring, either that or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> inky</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.” At this point Cros looked a Blu for the first time since coming out here, she didn't seem too surprised at his words so he continued.<br>
         <br>
“The problem is your paternal linage is a bit in question. Ya see little one, Karana brought you to us and claimed you as his own. Told me too look after you and teach you, to care for you. I’ve tried as best I can, to do the best I can for you, but your quickly out growing this place, and I’m at a loss as to what to do next.”<br>
        <br>
At this point Blu did interrupt the old druid, even so young as she was, few things had a will stronger then her, “Da,” though she’d pretty much out grown calling Cros Dad, she employed it here to soften the pain in the old mans face, it was clear this was not something he was looking forward to. “I’ve known since I was born. I remember the storm. I remember the war. I remember you.“ She looked up at him smiling, he was the first human warmth she’d felt on earth, and to this day it was still the most wonderful thing in the world she could remember. <br>
       <br>
“Do you honestly think Karana would send one of his own into this world without knowledge of where they were from?” Blurain sighed, she had been hoping this might never need come up, but it seemed of little importance now. “That war you saw was between Innoruuk and Karana. If its possible to believe, Innoruuk had fallen in love with my mother, a high elf. He thought he could corrupt her mind into falling for his evil ways, but she would have none of it. Her heart was already claimed by a fair haired human she’d meet on her travels thru the Karanas. Had she been a bit wiser to the true identity of the druid perhaps she would have run from him, just as surely as she did the nightmare dreams that Innoruuk sent to her. But Karana was gentile in his adoration for her, he was not so pompous as to woo a mortal in his godly form. When Innoruuk discovered the treachery, as he saw it, of Karana, he tried to destroy the woman, making her go insane. Karana protected her though, he provided safety for her in his mountains, and Tunare gave her followers to care for her earthly needs.”<br>
         <br>
“Months passed while it became apparent that she was pregnant there was little Karana could do but wait it out and hope Innoruuk tired of such games. Finally when it was time for her to give birth, Innoruuk took one last shot and tried to rip the unborn child from her womb. That was the battle you saw, Karana was keeping Innoruuk busy while my mother gave birth, once I was born I was out of Innoruuks reach. Though I’m no demigod, as Karana took a human body not just its form, I still bear some of the protection of the gods, and once born I could not be harmed without violent retribution.” Tears came her Blurain’s eyes at this point, as she remembered her mothers struggle to get the child into the world before she herself left it, dumping all her clerical magic into that one final act. “She died in the mountains,” was all she could get out before the tears streamed down her face, and Cros wrapped her slight form in his arms.<br>
       <br>
Shaking his head in dismay at the stupidity of gods, Cros wondered how it was they achieved anything, if they saw fit to give such knowledge to one so young. God’s child or not, Blurain was mortal, and it was then that Cros’s heart turned from them, and their so called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> infinite</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> wisdom, with disgust.<br>
       <br>
Hours after their initial departure from the glade, the two returned, one much older, and one much wiser. It seems the telling of her own life had made the young girl grow up faster then any child should have to. But when knowledge is given to the young, that is often its price.<br>
