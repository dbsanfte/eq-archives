I had an Epic Mob encounter scheduled for Yendar/Renux in Steamfront Mountains.  Initially, I had committments from enough people (a lot of them people I have known, fought with, and died with for a long time) to handle it no problem.  As we got closer to the encounter time, and I was confirming people, I had a lot of cancellations due to RL and other EQ committments.  I was strongly considering cancelling the encounter and dispelling any thoughts that I would get any closer to my Epic.  <br>
<br>
I had a lot of people come from all over Norrath at the drop of a hat to help me, and I want to say publicly I truly appreciate what you all did.  I came very close to cancelling the whole thing because the force I had was unbalanced for the encounter, but even with all the difficulties we faced, everyone present said they were willing to lay it on the line and go for it with what we had.  That was a heartfelt moment for me, and I appreciate it.  It really shows who your friends are when you are really in need.<br>
<br>
To give an indication of what was faced and overcome:<br>
<br>
1.  We had no cleric.  All the clerics cancelled out.  At the last minute a cleric ported in to help.  Thanks Borrun.<br>
<br>
2.  We had no where near the amount of Necros and Mages where I was comfortable with the Fear/Snare/Slow/Kite/Pet Attack technique.  Dymunq was the only necro, and he did an outstanding job on the Fears and pet attack.  Thanks bro, I would have cancelled it if you had not shown up.<br>
<br>
3.  At the last minute, after many cancellations, Shorthair and Dairie began porting to Sebillis and Karnors, telling people of the situation and porting people from all over Norrath for the battle.  Thanks, it would not have happened without you.  Shorthair and Dairie kept the heals up well for two druids trying to keep over 20 people alive.<br>
<br>
4.  I have to give very special thanks to Kaena and the great folks from Orion's Honor.  I have a lot of very old friends in that guild, and they really came through for me.  Hats off to Kaena, Scrogelious, Sabiar, and the rest of the folks who came to my aid when no one else would.  I owe you guys a debt of gratitude.  Even though they are a relatively new guild, they have some good people, and will grow into a strong and honorable guild if they continue to recruit people like the ones they have.<br>
<br>
5.  Heartfelt thanks goes to Kestri, a very dear friend who I have known since we were wee pups scrounging for copper pieces to buy food with; she gave me some moral support to go through with it and not call it quits. =)  She got some people to help out as well.  Thanks again Hun........one day I will convince you to marry me yet.....LOL<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who came.  If I forgot anyone, it is my bad memory at fault and not my heart.  I truly appreciate everyone who showed up, and if ever any of you need me, call and I will be there.<br>

<br>
Really wish I could have been there, but seeing as how our current set up is and only one out of the three of us can get on at a time, I am glad Kaena was able to help you out.  Next time you have an epic mob to kill make sure its after we get our dsl installed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That way you will have a cleric from the start.<br>
<br>
I want to also thank OH for helping a really old friend out.  Any time you need us Cru we will be there.<br>

But I have stories of 3 people doing Renux, and I have heard stories of 3-group raid forces getting their lunch money taken by Renux too.  My goal was to kill Renux with no chance whatsoever of anyone getting killed (since we had no cleric to res anyone on site either).  I would rather have more people than I need and have no casualties than to get wiped out by an epic mob and wonder later, &quot;Damn why didn't I bring more people?&quot;.  Either way whatever works at the time makes me happy. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56.showMessage?topicID=111.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56.showMessage?topicID=109.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56.threadControl?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm56>Salutations & Congratulations </a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
