The Theurgist Team Leader just started a new Q&amp;A thread:<br>
<br>
vnboards.ign.com/message....replies=27<br>
<br>
<br>
Several of the questions you asked are answered in the above threads. But here's a quick rundown.<br>
<br>
The Theurgist is not a pet class. Instead, we get three elemental lines with elementals, DDs, and buffs/debuffs. One of our (air) baseline spells is a group fast travel spell (not as fast as the singer types, though), which is very nice for speeding up getting around places. We also get a swordturn spell (earth spec) that negates the first physical hit on us completely, giving us time to get away. <br>
<br>
With my elementals, I can take down oranges and reds solo fairly easily (and even some purples). I can do any quest mob anywhere, even in the middle of a heavily populated camp. At levels 16-19, I was making 225K in XP per solo kill in some camps, which is pretty good for anybody soloing. The theurgist is probably one of the top soloing classes.  [Update: at 26-29, I can make 1.4 mil to 1.7 mil per solo kill]<br>
<br>
The theurgist is also a great grouping class. We have the group run speed, group swordturn, attack speed and damage buffs for our friends, attack speed debuff, root/snare, and AOE mez. <br>
<br>
The theurgist also is pretty good at RvR combat, especially as our elementals are great for harassing (and killing) casters and healers. Our elementals are short lived, but we can have multiple elementals going at the same time, limited only by their lifespans. You can have as many as you can cast.<br>
<br>
Earth Elementals last 30 seconds and are tough little melee tanks. Lots of HP, soak up damage, and do good melee damage. They usually last their entire 30 second lifespan. <br>
<br>
Air Elementals last 20 seconds and are mid-range with regard to melee damage/toughness. Their big advantage is their Stun, which lasts a mere second or two. Even so, a swarm of 5 or 6 air elementals can keep a mob fairly well stunned (and thus are greatly helpful in group combat...the tanks like it when the mobs don't hit them). <br>
<br>
Ice Elementals last 25 seconds and are fairly weak in melee. They have a very nice nuke, however, and tend to stay out of melee range at first (until the mob comes to them and initiates melee, that is). <br>
<br>
You had some additional specific questions, I think:<br>
<br>
The Air DD spell is &quot;wind&quot; based. It is our highest damage DD by a good bit. The base line ice DD does good work, but it has lower max and average damage, and the range can be much broader.<br>
<br>
With the additional points at 40-50, you can now get a maximum level elemental in all three lines (35/25/35, E/I/A). You really can't go wrong as long as you get at least one maximum elemental in at least one line (and that's pretty much impossible to do).  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A> at: 11/9/01 9:46:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uginwen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ginwen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 8:46:08 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advise on Theurgist please.</span><hr size=1> I like playing a Theurgist; made one on test just because I figured soloing would be very beneficial there. It's cool being able to tackle reds (not that I mostly do, just every so often to see if I still can).  Also, I like that, solo at least, all my deaths are either something coming up behind me, or my greed (either trying to get off that one last elemental/nuke before I run, or trying to get the dropped treasure chest when nasty mobs are a bit too close).<br>
<br>
All that being said, I am amazed when I go back and play my hero (1 level lower) at how much faster he can kill stuff--blues are like 2 hits (with my spear) and I can be up and fighting another blue in no time.  Of course, with my Theurgist, I tend to feel blues are beneath me, so that may be part of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueckointhedarkness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecko in the darkness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 9:32:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advise on Theurgist please.</span><hr size=1>   The two classes are fun play, Hero for when I have 3 hours to group, the Theur when I have to go afk alot. <br>

<br>
Ideally, you want to find mobs that are orange or possibly high yellow (best bang for the buck, overall, IMO) in camps and groups (for the bonuses) that you can kill for about half a tank of power, in order to minimize med time.<br>

That's because a good group will go hunting high reds and purples.  I have found that the experience I get per kill while soloing reds and oranges is about the same (and often LESS) than my share of the XP per kill when my group kills a purple.<br>
<br>
The real difference, then, is the rate of kills.  A good group can kill mobs 5 to 10X faster than I can, solo.<br>

Fortunately, a theugist is great in a group.

<br>
Then cast your damage adds on your tanks.  Cast your attack speed buff if you have the time and power (but it's not as critical).<br>
<br>
As the mob comes in, cast the attack speed debuff on it.  Every little bit helps.  <br>
<br>
Don't bother with root or mez when the mob is in melee.  If you want to practice your mezzing for later levels when it actually might be meaningful, do so.  Remember the timing...you need to get the mobs before they get significantly damaged or involved in melee combat.  For practice, I would mez the mob, then hit it with the attack speed debuff (which would break the mez).<br>
<br>
If your group is agreeable, toss an air elemental at a particularly tough mob.  The stuns will help and the XP loss will be minimal.  <br>
<br>
If the group is not particularly strong in tanks, then you may be casting more elementals. <br>
<br>
If you have too many mobs coming in and you don't feel comfortable trying to mez them, then be prepared to toss some elementals.  EEs might be best due to the long duration.  You won't get YOUR run speed chant back, though, until the last one drops.  The shorter duration AEs may be better for escape.<br>
<br>
I rarely DD in groups, except for fun or when I need to take down a mob near death so the tanks can turn to another one.  The primary damage is done by the tanks.  You help them do the damage, and help manage the mobs coming in.<br>
<br>
If you want more in-your-face action, play a paladin.  If you want non-stop nuking, play a wizard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/13/01 2:31:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .....</span><hr size=1> I grouped for a long time last night with mostly melee'ers.  We had a cleric at one point but he left and a ranger took his place.  Anyways, we tried alot of different strategies, many of which got us killed.  For the record we were hunting blues, yellows, oranges, reds, and purples(mostly reds and purples),9,10'sh.  Eventually we settled on a strategy depending on the color of mobs.  If they were blue i'd just pull it with our ice snare over to the group and they bashed it.  Or if it was in a non-roaming area they'd just run and kill it while i was medding.  If it was yellow, i'd send an earth elemental it, then 2 airs, and they attacked it once i released the 3rd elemental.  If it was orange or red, i'd send 1 earth, 3 airs, and 1 earth again then they'd attack it.  And if it was purple, i'd unload with an earth, as many airs as i could get off and maybe a few more earths.  We had an understanding for when to attack just so they wouldnt soak up all of the damage from the purple and reds.  The cleric couldnt keep up with the damage purples were laying on the tank which is why we couldnt use your conventional healing the tank while he tanks tactic.  <br>
<br>
The main problem we had was i was getting the most aggro from my elementals, and the groups first priority was to keep me alive.  It would head straight at me after so many elementals and we had no way to really slow orange, reds, and purples down.  My ice snare didnt seem to stick much on those high lvl cons.  In anycase i kept run ready and would run after i lost my first hit buff.  Then they would wack the monster from the back while it chased me.  Nothings better than having brisk wind kick in when you just ran outa stamina :)<br>
<br>
I really think grouping, at least for the lvl 9'sh range needs to be more balanced.  Aggro was almost impossible to manage against the high lvl mobs.  Once they picked a target it was almost impossible to get aggro off that target, not to mention it didnt take too many hits for a purple to kill a tank of our lvl.  We were probably going for mobs that were over our head, but i can take those mobs solo most of the time.  Actually, i could've done better solo imho, but i was in the mood to group and the bonus for grouping was pretty good it seemed.  I wouldnt say this on an official board or where Funcom would read it but i really believe Theurgists are overpowered.  I know we have an exp penalty from using the elementals, but it hardly matters since i'm still getting some really good exp.  Actually, the only thing we have thats really overpowering are our elementals, they are just awesome pets.  It was fun but i felt bad that the rest of the group wasnt doing more although they were just happy to be getting really experience.  <br>
<br>
Maybe its different at  higher lvls, at least i hope it is, but i felt like the other classes werent able to be nearly as effective as i was.  Once i had to go, the group broke up and its kinda sad when that happens when you have to go.  Again, i'm not saying what we did above is the best tactic, but we tried all kinds of stuff and this was the best tactic that we ended up using with little death and steady exp.  <br>
<br>
Also, a great spot for lvl 8,9,10'sh for a Theurgist is Snowdonia Station in the Black Mountains.  You can bind there, theres a healer and merchants in the building next to the bind.  Just a short run away there is a valley where Wergs(sp?) which are some type of dogs, as well as goblins spawn.  At the top of the hill there, there is a goblin fort as well.  Just hunt the spawn that is near the bottom of the hill but make sure to pull away from the hill so you dont get add's.  Or you can just wait until they move closer to you.  A short run away to the other end are bandits that hang out under some trees.  The bandits are usually blue and yellow, but green sometimes.  There is also a named bandit thats purple who wanders around with 2 other bandits.  The dogs are all yellow, orange, red, or purple, but at least you know the purple ones are low enough purple that you can take.  The best thing about this spot though is that the bind point is so close so dying and getting healed isnt a big deal at all.  <br>
<br>
Heh, this was longer than i thought it'd be, but if your looking for a hunting spot, its a pretty decent place imo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueqaquinas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQAquinas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/13/01 3:59:24 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advise on Theurgist please.</span><hr size=1> <b>We were probably going for mobs that were over our head</b><br>
<br>
I've found in both DAoC, and earlier in AO, that groups tend to hunt harder mobs than they should.  Maybe it's some sort of new-game syndrome.  People become fixated on seeing those big experience numbers for individual kills, rather than focusing on the amount of experience gained over time.  In general, I think you're going to be better off (as you were in EQ) engaging in a larger number of manageable fights rather than a smaller number of down-to-the-wire battles with mobs you can barely handle.  The specific "con" you need for that will vary with the type of group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaaroan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaroan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/01 8:57:25 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/foolthatspeaks/bartxxx.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advise on Theurgist please.</span><hr size=1> I found this post interesting.
