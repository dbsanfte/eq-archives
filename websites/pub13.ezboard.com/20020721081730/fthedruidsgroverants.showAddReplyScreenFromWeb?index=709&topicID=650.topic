Druids don't even really want to be as good as Clerics in xp groups.  I think the majority of the Druids here agree that healing needs a revamp and Clerics need an upgrade to Divine Light.  Point is this is a Druid petition therefor we are addressing Druid issues which in the end game boils down to the roll that Druids are assigned in raids, healing. <br>
<br>
Clerics should be full force on the side of this petition because we are asking (forcing) VI to take a look at the effectiveness of all heals vs aoe raid effect.  AOE's were put in to counterbalance Complete Healing which has a trivializing effect on all end game raid mobs. With Lucin VI has turned from the belief that all they must do to make encounters more difficult is to upgrade the number of hitpoints a mob has or hits for allowing both VI and raid forces to be more creative in the end game balance.  Clerics need diversity but as long as they steadfastly have a strangle hold on Raid healing via CH they will be considered godly and balanced.  Once healing is looked at and spread out among the 3 priest classes more evenly, VI will have a reason to give Clerics the diversity they crave.<br>
<br>
I would recommend that instead of Clerics coming here and saying no to our petition what they should be doing is collectively forming their own petition showing where CH has forced Clerics to be keyholded into being Raid Bots.  Focusing on the issues that effect clerics in end game group situations. An increase to the MOK line that would have varying effects but not stack with one another so that they would be situational would be great for Clerics.  Ask for a self only invis post 50.  There are many things that are tagged undead that are very good for end game xp groups but the last dot recieved is at lvl 52 and the damage ratio on it is laughable vs other classes dots increases in dps on cleric undead dots would not only give a variable role in groups but also give a limited solo ability.  Clerics also can have a valuable role in groups with their stun line a roll shared with enchanter but when a cleric is stunning the chanter can focus on mezzing increase the effects and variables on stuns. <p><CENTER>

I think that you're starting to see the problem here.  Other than CH, clerics don't bring too much more to the table in normal situations.  It probably doesn't help that they have the least number of spells amongst the priest classes, and while I haven't looked it up lately, they did have the least number of spells alotted to them of any caster class.  So they don't bring that much utility to the table.<br>
<br>
I could also point out that right now the clerics have 5 useless spell lines (lull, PB AE DD, yaulp, wreckless strength, summoned hammer), further crippling the class, and a couple more that are only marginally useful.  As an example, you brought up stuns in your post.  The reason that most clerics don't use their stuns all that often, especially at high levels is that they are resisted heavily by mobs, which makes them almost useless in a grouping situation.  Even more so on raids.  This is why paladins are the ones using the stuns, if it lands, great.  If it doesn't, it doesn't burn up critical mana.  Oh, and as a bonus it's a heavy taunt.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Right now, the specialist class that you have to compete for in groups is gimped.  Which I believe will be the thing that will kill this petition.  As long as the specialist has to work with mostly gimped spells, each time that they look at balancing to see what's fair, they'll look at the specialist and give you less.<br>
<br>
I know it sucks, and the clerics should probably from one of their own, but for the most part, their aren't really all that many people that I've seen who still play a cleric as a primary character.  Most now are alts that people play on raids because they are needed.<br>
<br>

DRUIDS came up with their own petition because verant is discussing caster balancing.  DRUIDS want to balance DRUIDS!! not other classes.  It seems everyone else wants balance as well.  Well please, go right ahead with  your own petition.  No one on this messageboard is stopping you.  <br>
<br>
This peititon voices the concerns about druids of a majority of people from this board that play druids.  Get the people from your forums to do the same addressing YOUR issues (and please refrain from stating us as the cause for your petition.  none of our concerns have even been looked at as far as we know.  So dont base your petition on the issues in our petition  ie dont say well druids are wanting this, so give us this.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants>Rants</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
