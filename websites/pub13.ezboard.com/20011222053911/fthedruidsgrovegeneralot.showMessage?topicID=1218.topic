This has been in the making for over 2 years.<br>
No I'm not talking about Harry Potter.<br>
The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; comes out this holiday season.<br>
The Lord of the rings trilogy by Tolkien.<br>
These books have establishished many of the symbols and archetypes that fantasy books, movies , and games have  adapted to in the last 50 years.It has remained what all other fantasies measure themselves up against.<br>
The scope of the story is vast as the forces of cosmic and earthy good and evil approach their final conflict.So astonishingly true to life was this world created, that Tolkien had over a hundred pages of appendices filled with maps, calendars, genealogies and culture.<br>
And who can ever forget that incredibly evil inscription written in elvish on the One Ring of Power.<br>
<br>
One Ring to rule them all,One Ring to find them,<br>
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/29/01 11:53:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Our movie may finally be here</span><hr size=1> Sadley, this movie's opening profits will not even come close to Harry Potter.  It loos good, but I question the lack of marketing.  I mean, I've seen theatrical trailers and television adds for blockbuster movies almost a year before they are released.  here it is, less than 1 month away, and I think I have seen a Burger King add and 1 comercial.  They need to juice it up an bit.  With such a large cast, they should be playing the talk show circuts like crazy soon enough though.<br>
<br>
I look forward to it.  I've already painted several of the LotR Warhammer minatures and my GF is currently re-reading the books.<br>
<br>
So far the best line in fantasy films is:<br>
(In best goat voice)<br>
&quot;Use the stick Willow!&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's hope LotR can top that!<br>

<br>
I read a review of the movie yesterday and the reviewer really liked it.  According to the review: It's nearly 3 hours long, and the opening is a bit slow (just like the book :) but after that it's a great movie.  Effects are incredible and the scenes in Moria are the best parts of the movie.<br>
<br>
I'm really looking forward to a well-done movie of these books.  The previous movie and cartoons haven't done them anywhere near the justice they deserve.<br>
<br>
Sure, Tolkein is wordy and the plotting is a bit sluggish at times, but the rich story and diverse characters deserve a good movie treatment =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/29/01 1:01:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Our movie may finally be here</span><hr size=1> Zenia, I wish that were true.

<br>
The general public is alot dumber than you're giving them credit for.  LotR will do well, but the depth and emersive story line will not be the reason:)  People want to see big battles and maybe Liv Tylers booty.<br>

However, every year the highest grossing film should also be held to the same standard, which they are not.  Reguardless, the above average viewing time of HP should easily settle the score due to the lack of times the movie can be viewed in a day/weekend.  Btw, HP was also on a record number of screens as well.<br>

None has to 'beat' the other really.  I'm one of the millions quite happy to see both :)<br>
<br>
As for marketing... this is Tolkien!  Millions of people have been anticipating the movie for years!  It doesn't need marketing ;)  Harry Potter didn't either IMO, even though it got plenty. <p>-- <br>

Now those were great books.<br>
<br>
Yeah, i thought the LOTR trailer looked incredible.  Although i was recently in CompUSA for a monitor and they had the Star Wars 'Attack of the Clones' trailer running on some deluxe PowerMac system with a huge screen.  Man, even though the name 'Attack of the Clones' sounds so stupid, it looks like Star Wars might get good again.  It doesnt look nearly as Disney-like as Phantom Menace, and the tone seems much more serious.  I couldnt believe how good that trailer looked.  <br>
<br>
I like the fact that Hollywood is making these Fantasy-Adventure type movies tho, hope they make more.  Just dont make anymore that turn out like DnD did, that was a stupid movie.  <br>

What is the big deal as to who beats who between these two movies.<br>
<br>
SillyEskimo, you are most likely correct in your observation: that the lack of marketing by the LotR will ensure that Harry Potter keeps his box office numbers unbeaten.<br>
<br>
But box office records are not the end-all indicator of how good a movie is.  They are really mainly an indicator of how much hype was generated for a movie. I know that you aren't equating box office records with the quality of the movies, btw.  You are pointing out that generating hype through marketing means big box office numbers.  <br>
 If it were left to me, I would prefer that the LotR not stoop to the level of blatant commercialism that Harry Potter has, just for the sake of dignity.  I mean, c'mon!  Harry Potter toilet paper??!!??!!<br>
<br>
Won't it be interesting, though if LotR really does beat Harry in its opening weekend, without having to spend 13 billion dollars on its ad campaign?<br>

I don't think there's a lack of publicity about this movie, but I do think that there may be a significant number of people out there who don't realize this is a trilogy.  <br>
The guy behind us in the theater after the movie, turned to his family and asked puzzledly, &quot;Did I miss something?&quot;  The ending is going to leave some people confused and unfulfilled.  Maybe &quot;To be continued...&quot; would have been too cheesey, but the alternative is a segment of the audience that will leave thinking, &quot;I spent 3 hours of my life watching that and there's no ending?&quot;  While I don't think the movie should have had a different ending, I do think some indication of continuance would satisfy those people.<br>
