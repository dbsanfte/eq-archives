<br>
1) Indy joins a guild but is on the list for planes or reservable uber mobs.<br>
<br>
2) person can be in a guild then deguild, becoming an indy and sign up.  <br>
<br>
With number 1, what time period is reasonable for the indy to still claim their spot while they are on thier &quot;trial&quot; with a guild?  We had one guild say one month another guild say 2 weeks.   I personally don't have a problem with either of these times.  With the new raid rules, they say immediately.  I'm a bit bothered by some people who should be abiding by these rules yet come here and say &quot;this indy is on a trial basis with the guild&quot;.   Some ppl have even implied in the past that this Indy should get to keep their spot till the trial date is over.  Aren't rules rules?  Maybe I'm misinterpreting something....<br>
<br>
With number 2, what time period is reasonable for the person who deguilds and goes indy.  Should they be deguilded for a little bit before?<br>
<br>
Of course this all would be hard to police..I mean ANYTHING is hard to police no matter what.  Just wanted to throw that out there.<br>

Originally, it happened with Tumagok, but now several guilds are doing it.<br>
<br>
Because of this, I would suggest that we do the following.  Any individual who's on a rotation list when they join a guild for a trial &quot;membership&quot; will retain their spot on the rotation list, BUT everytime the rotation list &quot;moves&quot; they will be moved down one place.  Thus, no one who's on a trial guild membership will ever reach the top of the rotation while they are in a guild.  They remain an equal distance from the top of the list while they are trying their guild.  If they stay in the guild, and the guild holds a spot, they can simply be removed.  If they decide to leave, they've only give up two weeks or four weeks or whatever.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any problems with this?   <p><BR>

<br>
A person who deguilds and becomes an indy can pretty much put themselves on a rotation list immediately as long as another one of their characters isn't still in a guild.  With the length of our rotation lists, I don't see this as a problem, because if they rejoin the guild, they have their indy spot removed.  If they rejoin for a trial basis, and I do what's suggested above, they can never reach the top of the list. <p><BR>

I'm suprised no one has said anything about this.  Or is it just &quot;forbidden&quot; to call people out on this.  Instead I guess what people would rather do is rip each other apart in all these threads which is what I've noticed even though those people aren't the ones that are doing the direct deed.  No one seems to want to call it out who is doing stuff or looks like they are doing stuff even if they aren't.  Instead..let's just rip everyone to pieces based on their views.  That is so off the wall.<br>
<br>
The last few indys that have become guilded no one has said jack and that bothers me.  They take their sweet time not even saying a thing about themselves being on the list and it takes someone to have to call them out on it.  /boggle  Then their guild members RUSH to defend them and say it is a trial when they should have been up front...How many guilds intiation periods do we have to keep track of?<br>
<br>
I don't get it.<br>
<br>
I believe the rules state immediately, Zesty.  I'm for following the rules and if we need to change them to give indy's a trial period in their guilds, fine then lets' vote on it.  I would vote they should get a finite trial period because I don't see the big deal but atleast the time would be finite.  But i believe the people voted and the choice was once guilded, you cant' hold any spot as an indy.  Follow the rules or amend them.  That is what I think.  <br>
<br>
Saph<br>
<br>
PS. atleast with the people that deguild and THEN put their name on the list..they have to wait an awful long time to have their turn come up.  That is a decent deterrrent but it is NOT a deterrent to leave an indy name up while they are guilded and just keep moving them back one spot till they deguild. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A> at: 1/17/01 12:52:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1359<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/17/01 4:13:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid Leader status changes on Uber/Planar Lists</span><hr size=1> One more thing Zest..the thing is..what is the procedure then?  Do indy's come here and state that they have joined a guild and how long their trial period is?  How long do we allow one and who monitors it.  This is silly really.  The fact is there is no procedure for this..and the rules don't support such a procedure.<br>
<br>
I just think it is not right to let indy's still be on the list when guilded because people nitpicked/practically harassed everyone over these rules AND the voting in multiple threads and yet here we have cases coming up more and more that go against what was voted on and odd no one is saying jack.  Is it because they are from &quot;popular guilds&quot;?  I sure hope not.  Hopefully you can see what trouble this can cause down the road.  If anything we need to follow the rules we voted on, then amend them.  Sorry but I don't know why we even voted rules in if we weren't going to follow them.  Indy's were the main reason why we even moved to do them from the threads I gathered.  So this was in mind when people voted on them and should be carried out the way we voted.<br>

<br>
Ok what I interpret Zesty's meaning is this:<br>
<br>
Ymaeel is currently on a &quot;trial membership&quot; with Abyss.  She holds a spot on the VS list as does Abyss.  She is 10th in line atm. With Zesty's statement while Ymaeel is on a &quot;trail membership&quot; she will remain 10th on the list and everyone will move around her.   If she does not remain in Abyss after the 2 week period then she will be still 10th on the list and will not have moved up at all and even would have been passed by 2 possibly 3 people.  Even if it is a month trial then she still would be 10th.  So she would never get up to the top and then be able to disband and have her indy spot right away as you stated.  She would never move up.  If she does stay in Abyss then the spot is removed.  I think this is very reasonable.  I do think we need to set a limit on how long someone can be on a trial basis.  I think 1 month is more than enough.  <br>
<br>
I just hate to see someone lose their spot upon joining a guild and then a week or two into it the guild removes them or the guild falls apart.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1361<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/18/01 1:06:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid Leader status changes on Uber/Planar Lists</span><hr size=1> Twiggie I'm all for being reasonable.  I think there should be a set time that this is allowed for purposes of these lists and raids.  One guild thinks it is 2 weeks, one guild thinks it is one month, who knows what the next guild will say and we'll have no leg to stand on due to precendent being so &quot;open&quot;.<br>
<br>
I guess my mild frustration from the people here on this board is they were so open and willing to tear others apart on this very issue when we were debating the new rules in like umm..20 threads..hehe way back when.  Instead of challenging what is going on now to what they voted on so adamantly in with the new rules, you see ppl letting the indy's fall through some of the holes a lot of us pointed out and they pshawed at us calling us names.  So that makes me wonder about the character of some people and why they would let this keep going on and not say anything.  Get my drift?  <br>
<br>
Is it because they are in &quot;popular&quot; guilds and no one wants to rock the boat?  /shrug dunno just looks odd. Everyone wanted to be such sticklers before..where are these same people or do I just not have the list of whose ass to kiss next?  /double shrug <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
What I hate to see is people joining guilds just to gain an advantage instead of because they want to have fun with their friends.  <br>
<br>
They join a guild, and because they suck so badly, the guild kicks them out a few weeks later.  This is the fault of the guild and of the individual.  The guild should have stricter recruitment process and the individual (like Ymaeel) shouldn't suck for fucking bad that they have to wander from guild to guild.<br>

An amendment to the rules needs to be made if this is to be accepted.<br>
<br>
1) need to establish how long one can be in a guild for a trial basis when it comes to keeping your indy name on the list - let's put one month out there.  If you don't define this..you'll have people like Belaiel form a guild and put 8 months on the trial period.<br>
<br>
2) need to establish a procedure - meaning the guild leader or Indy comes and posts in the raid forum when they joined their GUILD and state a one month date from that on when their &quot;trial&quot; membership ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
The mods are technically going against what was voted on - this is no offense to them it's just do they have a right to superimpose what they think on how to handle things or do they have the right to amend how they see fit?  I know Zesty and the rest of them are very fair, but rules were voted on (this has nothing to do with fairness) and this discussion even took place about the Indys getting guilded.  I believe the rules state:  An indy can't hold a spot if guilded...PERIOD.    If you are in your 50's on these raid lists, I would think you would have fought with the guild you are joining enough to know you will make it through the trial period.  If not, I find that wierd that an Indy would join a guild frivilously.<br>

I doubt people join a guild thinking they will wash out during the trial period.  I think if you join a guild you lose your spot immediately.  You intended to join and knew the consequences of your actions before you clicked &quot;yes.&quot;<br>

Ymaeel was guilded an entire *gasp* three days before I personally, officially, and directly Let You Know. Nobody asked for special treatment, I only posted her &quot;temp&quot; status because it is fact. I cannot however speak for her future intetions and suggested that Zest Talk To Her Directly. Is that so hard? Did that inspire this call to arms? What if she'd disbanded on the 4th day and was bumped out of her spot because I had posted her membership only hours before? Certainly not fair to her, and bad guilt on me. Relax a bit, don't be so damn paranoid. Every post you enter reguarding Abyss lately is a conspiracy theory and I can't understand why. And to say we're not following the rules is rubbish.<br>

You will notice it has been 3 indys now that went guilded and the exact same thing happened - neither of them came here and all rushed to their defense that they were on trial period it seemed - exception CA.  It's not a role I chose, it is a fact that the rules have been put in place and who is suppose to watch them?  Why aren't they being followed?  I also posted it didn't matter to me that there was a temp status or did you conveniently miss that?  I think things should be defined is all. <br>
<br>
Zest can talk to her all she wants, the point is, the way the rules are written now, indy comes off of the lists when they join a guild.  No where does it say that it allows for any trial period time.  Is it so hard for you to GET IT that maybe next time someone's trial date in their guild will be 7 months?  Is it?  What will you be able to say then to that person except..uhoh...a precedent has been set.<br>
<br>
Where have I mentioned anything about Conspiracy?  I have not at all.  I simply am moving that we follow the rules here that everyone bitched at each other about.  Simple.  If you find conspiracy in that, you have nothing better to do then Vulgarr.  And if you can't see my point, tough shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  And I can say we aren't following the rules because I'd like you to point me to where it says that there is a trial period allowed.  Where Vulgarr?<br>

Are you that egocentric?  I never said you asked for a trial period.  I never asked you to forfeit her raid spot.  I am not dabbling in others affairs.  You still do not get it pal.  Rules are rules and we voted on rules.  Period. How are rules suppose to be enforced?  Hmm?  When all these rules such as Adun's proposal go into effect, do you honestly think Zest wants the sole responsibility of making sure everything is fine?  No, she wants people to speak up when stuff isn't right.   <br>
<br>
And your egocentric problem is still?  If you have a problem with me, fine.  I really don't care but to miss the point and keep being an ass on here is out of line.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I also don't see anything wrong with the Indy's not coming DIRECTLY here to check in with the &quot;list police&quot; when they join a guild. Three days doesn't mean squat on the VS list. Your hateful tone is misplaced and undeserved.&quot; - Vulgarr<br>
<br>
I do see a problem with an Indy not coming here.  They signed up as an Indy and have the responsibility to come here and take themselves off when they become guilded.  All 3 without exception did not come here once they were guilded.  They were all 3 called out.  Funny but I didn't even call out the first 2, other people did.  Where was your egocentric voice then?  You said nothing when the other 2 were called out by different people.  It's because it is me..hehe that you come out.  My, I'm very flattered <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Yah 3 days may not mean squat, but no one had said anything about any of the 3 till someone brought it up.  So what, it was brought up big deal.  I wasn't mean about it, I posted it in the right forum...Deal with it Vulgarr.  If you even TRIED to read any of my previous posts, I'd like your egotistical self to point out where my tone was hateful?  Where vulgarr?  Where?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You'll probably avoid this quest too as you did the previous one. <br>
<br>
I find it amusing that you throw stuff out there and you don't address it.  You throw out there, how dare I say the rules aren't followed,then I tell you where they aren't followed and you glaze over it, not answering.  You are bound and determined to think I'm so bad..look in the mirror and ask yourself how you handled the LOIO when Watchers came to help.  A few of us weren't too happy about your comments on Watchers that day, and it wasn't just me Vulgarr.<br>

And I understand your point perfectly, but I was offended by your tone and you implying that we'd try to pull one over on ya. You've been uncharacteristically bitchy on every post I've visited lately and I just don't understand it. I admit I'd totally deserve hostility from others that posted above, but not from you....someone I /considered amiably on the few occasions we've met. <br>
Please explain this Ill Omen issue, either here or in game.....I haven't a clue what your talking about. When 30 &lt; Watchers &gt; started gathering in Ill Omen, no one was sure exactly if they were there to help or what. I was told they had intentions to do the Monk Epic at that same time...BUT Zorlov had already handed in his item and triggered the spawn. I said ABSOLUTELY NOTHING derogatory, in fact I thanked them SEVERAL times and pledged my help if ever I could return their kindness. I suppose I deserve a good /bonking for doubting those good people's motives, but it was only because there was a minor dispute over the spawn to start with. Please explain or elaborate how this made you &quot;unhappy&quot; or look down upon me.<br>
I'm really sorry if I come off as overly grouchy....just feeling a little soft skinned after all the recent pokes and prods. I've kinda elected myself Abyss PR man lately, it just hurts hearing my family of friends being slammed when we try hard to make everyone happy.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1427<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/22/01 4:58:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid Leader status changes on Uber/Planar Lists</span><hr size=1> This will be the last time I respond to you vulgarr in this topic.  If you read my stuff and found it &quot;hate&quot; filled and with such a tone, then maybe it is your subconcious reading it because you dislike me sooo bad..lol.  Anyone can see by my original request in the proper folder was written nicely and Zesty responded in kind that she would check it out.  You came in smug and acted like an ass just like you are doing here.  I really don't care what &quot;tone&quot; you hear in it because I didnt' attack ANYONE.  You read that?  I didn't attack ANYONE.  This was a decent thread till you posted.  So get off of your high horse.  I simply brought an issue that I thought was needing to be talked about due to several threads DEDICATED to ripping others apart for even speaking about this.<br>
<br>
You just said it yourself, you take this stuff personal.  Maybe you should be the one to chill the hell out and not read so much into things.  Ever think about that?  Until you got involved in this thread it was doing fine with the input..but you had to turn it back on you and yes, I got a little pissed off in this thread that you made this all so personal.  SO please go look in the mirror when you accuse me of stuff.  I never SAID you or your guild pulled something OVER on anyone.  If you READ pal, I stated that I don't see two weeks or one month as an issue and I was concerned with guilds who would claim 7 months next time using this precedent.  You have been a real DICK in posts especially when they concern a response to mine..so don't call me a bitch when your pig pen ain't clean.  Oh I see, so you deserve hostility from others but not me with all your posts, am i under a different standard? LOL.  Again, look at this thread and who turned it personal..it wasn't me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I won't go into the Ill omen issue, you know what you said derogatory and assholish and a few of us heard it too and discussed it and were quite pissed.  Rerun that in your head.  I was just pointing out the things you said about me that if I put a mirror to your face, it would bounce back and that was an example.  <br>
<br>
Vulgarr you didn't just come off overly grouchy, you made this thread into personal attacks that were never meant to go there.  You are the one to insinuate alot of stuff I never even printed and now can't even back it up.  Thanks for twisting a very valid issue that needed to be dealt with.  It's not my problem that you are finding yourself having to stick up for Abyss and the perceived &quot;siege&quot; on them.  I certainly never pointed them out or harped on them in this thread anywhere.  Are you done with the personal attacks?  I'll enjoy reading them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but in this thread they are out of place.  I find it funny you can't point out where the TONE was Venemous.. hahahahaha egads...<br>
<br>
Saph<br>
<br>
PS.  this is still a valid issue unrelated to specific people whether or not they like to insert themselves in here and feel &quot;attacked&quot;.  How can one have respect for rules if they aren't followed and it is up to how someone else interprets them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1249.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1253.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1246.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1249.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1249.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1249.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
