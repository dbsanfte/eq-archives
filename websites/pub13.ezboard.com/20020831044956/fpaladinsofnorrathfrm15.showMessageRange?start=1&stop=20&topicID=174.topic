My guild, Vexare, was one of the lucky guilds invited, and I was honored by being selected to represent them along with 5 other emmisaries (6 from each guild were invited). I was also the only paladin present (pink hearts for all!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

I would welcome you to this place, yet I feel that a welcome is not quite deserving of the [fate] in store for you. I know there was no welcome for me when I first ventured to this place, and look at me now. I am nothing but a frail, ghostly figure of what I once was.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:13 2002] Dietrich says, 'what fate'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:13 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil says, 'I may look as though I am healthy and vibrant, though your eyes deceive you.' Ferrin chuckles. 'It has been so long since I was imprisoned here, I cannot tell you when it was. To me it seems like only yesterday, but I know deep down that time does not pass for me any more. I, like you, thought that the intrigue and mystery of this great lair was second only to the treasures that lay within. When I arrived however, I found not a lair, but a massive tomb whose occupants were meant to keep a very large, and very powerful [beast] within.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:23 2002] Dietrich says, 'what beast'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:23 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil says 'Time has told us that a great many things are unexplainable, and even less understood. Though I don't know the entire story, it comes to bear that long ago, there was a great council of [elders]. These elders decreed what could and could not be done, for the benefit of their kind. Certain things were done to prevent bad things. . . or bad creatures from being created. Other things were done to prohibit the slaying of those of the same bloodline.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:35 2002] Dietrich says, 'what elders'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:35 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil says 'The council of elder dragons. Truly, theirs is a majestic, powerful and battle worn species. The elders had decreed that no two dragons of opposing elements would be allowed to mate. No explanation had been given, though I believe I know the reason why it was given. Despite the decree, a pair of elemental dragons slipped away to remote areas of Norrath and mated, and the creation of a great prismatic dragon took place. And that is the beast, strewn of opalescent scales, headstrong and a leader in his own right. It was he that this tomb was entrusted to keep held, forever. Alas, that was not meant to be, as more and more, cunning [travelers] like you would make their way further and further into the lair.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:47 2002] Dietrich says, 'what travelers'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:50:47 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil chuckles. 'You're looking at one right now, Dietrich. I was one of the first to make my way into the depths of this forsaken lair. My little gnomish friend here was also one of the earliest adventurers to peruse the contents of this massive warren. But there have been many more that have traversed these areas, all to little or no avail, most perishing at the hands of the mighty [automatons] throughout.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:00 2002] Dietrich says, 'what automatons'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:01 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil says 'Well, you probably encountered one or two of them before you found us here. They are the beasts that were initially created to keep people like us out so that the prismatic dragon wouldn't be awakened from his [eternal slumber]. In recent times, they have been placed here by the four ancients to keep people away from the evil that lay beyond. They are made of local velium and ice, carved from the creative minds of immortals. They have a singular consciousness, to do as their master bids. . . and to that truth, they hold steady.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:20 2002] Dietrich says, 'what eternal slumber'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:20 2002] Ferrin Q`Nyil says 'Alas I am not really the person to explain that bit of history to you. You might see if any of my. . . companions. . . have any insight into the slumber that the prismatic beast undertook. In any case, I bid you well, young mortal, and hope that you do not partake in the same shortcomings that I did.'<br><br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:36 2002] Dietrich tells stevent:8, 'moving on to bittles'<br><br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:40 2002] Dietrich says, 'Hail, Bittles the Lost'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:40 2002] Bittles the Lost says 'Eh, hrm?

Anyway, that bugger got made an' he went wild all over Velious, making demands and actin' all proud and powerful and things like that. Well, he decided he wanted ta have a nice big home in the middle of the mountain. And you know what? That's what he did! Yer standin' in the middle of his lair. Well after he [went crazy], some of those other dragon-folk decided it would be good ta put him in here and put him ta sleep for all eternity. [Four] of 'em kept him sleepin' and made sure that no one, such as yerself, could get in here ta wake him up.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:51:50 2002] Dietrich says, 'who went crazy'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:01 2002] Dietrich says, 'what went crazy'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:07 2002] Dietrich says, 'Who went crazy'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:10 2002] Dietrich says, 'Went crazy?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:16 2002] Dietrich says, 'what is going zracy'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:21 2002] Dietrich says, 'what is going crazy'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:25 2002] Dietrich says, 'what four'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:25 2002] Bittles the Lost says 'Them thar four warders. They were the most powerful elemental dragons of their time, and kept that sleeping fella asleep for quite some long time. Names of Nanzata, Tukaarak, Hraashna, and Ventani, if'n my mind serves me correct-like. When they started here, they had some other big-time dragon create the big ice creatures all over the place -- the golems, don't ya know? In any case, they upped and got kilt by some folks like you a while back, causing all kinds of panic and havoc. The ice guys were dismantled by the [new inhabitants] of this here lair and reassembled to serve them. Not that it really matters to me, I got lost here anyway and look what happened ta me!'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:37 2002] Dietrich says, 'what new inhabitants'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:52:37 2002] Bittles the Lost says 'Why the ancients of course! They just kinda cropped up when that big shiny fella was awakened by those other people. Some thought that those four warders were trouble, but believe me, they're like drakelings in comparison. Kal or Jobana over here might know more about them than I do, I'm just a lost little gnome with no where to go.'<br><br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:06 2002] Dietrich says, 'Hail, Jobana Du`Ata'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:06 2002] Jobana Du`Ata looks at you with a most dismal look in her eyes. 'Your kind have returned once again. I knew this day would come, yet hoped that perhaps there would be no further clashing in this tomb. I was mistaken, for here you are. The great sleeping beast has already been released unto the world to wreak havoc, cause destruction and attempt to take back what he has lost, so what further purpose could you have for coming here? Perhaps you are soul hunting, searching for those of us lost in here years ago, long since forgotten by any mortal family we may have had. Or perhaps you are searching for the [ancient dragons] that inhabit this lair.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:12 2002] Dietrich says, 'what ancient dragons'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:12 2002] Jobana Du`Ata says 'The ancients were long ago part of the following that the mighty prismatic lord had before he was imprisoned here, in his own dwelling. Kildrukaun, oldest and wisest of them had at first spoken out against the creation of a prismatic dragon, claiming that Veeshan herself would have to approve of such a creation and that it would never take place. When it did take place however, and the dragon that never would exist was created, he traded his beliefs for those of new ones, claiming that this new prismatic dragon was part of a prophecy from Veeshan. He aptly called this prismatic dragon [Kerafyrm], or Prophetic Savior and began this new wonder's tutelage into greatness.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:46 2002] Kargrath says, 'who is Kerafyrm?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:46 2002] Jobana Du`Ata says 'The majestic beast grew quickly, learning much and gaining great power in short time. He expanded his knowledge and his [influence], pushing the dragons into a kind of new era, where dragons would be the ultimate power on the planet once again. Many were left in a wake of fright behind Kerafyrm, believing that he may be too powerful for his own good, yet fearing that if they spoke out against him in this time, they would be condemned in some horrible way.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:57 2002] Dietrich says, 'what influence'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:53:57 2002] Jobana Du`Ata says 'Imagine a being with such power that he was unstoppable in battle. Imagine that this same creature held a loathing for all creatures not of dragon kin. Imagine also that this creature was not born into this deep rooted, dark hatred of the species, and that as he grew older, wiser and more powerful, he came to be aware of his powers and of the trying issues that kept his people back. This was the beast that was Kerafyrm, and as he grew in power, so too did his word. After some time, that which Kerafyrm spoke became law to the lands, and he usurped even the power and influence of the high council. What was once a time of might and strength through his word turned into a constant [chafe] against the necks of dragonkind.'<br><br>[Fri Jul 26 20:54:26 2002] Dietrich says, 'Hail, Kal t`Ven'<br>[Fri Jul 26 20:54:26 2002] Kal t`Ven says 'Greetings, young sleuth. These are trying times, as I am sure you are aware, but it is good that there are still adventurous sorts like you about. Were there not, I am confident that our deaths would have been in vain, and not in the spirit of exploration and danger-seeking. However, there is one thing to be said for adventuring, and still another to be said for flights of fancy.

Ulessa and I first met him shortly after we were wed in the small cauldron named after Dagnor, and from there embarked on a long series of 'explorative missions', as he put it. He had a way of always getting us into [trouble], but nothing we couldn't handle. Even after years of adventuring, even after we thought we'd seen everything there was to see, he would find something new to explore. He was quite an amazing little gnome.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:38 2002] Dietrich says, 'what trouble'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:38 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'You name it. Milas was always intrigued by new and exciting, often very dangerous things and he would always ask us if we wanted to come along. Being the intrepid explorers that we were, and that we were best friends with Milas, we couldn't say no. So we went along with him everywhere he went, and let me tell you, he had a keen eye for locale. We'd explore the lands of Antonica, then move on to something hidden and mysterious in the ancient ruins on Kunark. We spent more time on the road looking for that next piece of the puzzle, or trying to find that next smallest creature that we called the road home, and Milas our family. That is, until he asked us to explore the ancient mystery of the [sleeping dragon].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:50 2002] Dietrich says, 'what sleeping dragon'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:50 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'That's the same thing I asked Milas so long ago when he told us about this extraordinary creature. ''Paldar me ol' friend, Ulessa ya beaut', listen to what I 'ave found'' he said to us. We had no idea of the immensity of this mighty creature until he had described, in detail, what the myths and tales had to say about this beast. We listened intently as he went on and on about this powerful sleeping dragon and how it had been put there by a great many dragons long ago. We both knew that [he was planning] something around this dragon, but we didn't know what it was exactly at the time.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:58 2002] Dietrich says, 'what was he planning'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:40:58 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'After he finished his fabulous tale, he explained to us that he was going to search the planet for the fabled prismatic beast, and that he wanted us to come along with him. We were stunned when he finished, and even more so that he asked us to come with him to find this monstrosity. Both Ulessa and I tried to talk Milas out of it. We pleaded with him not to go, and told him it was a [foolish endeavor], but he wouldn't listen.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:09 2002] Dietrich says, 'what foolish endeavor'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:09 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'Talk of a dragon almost as powerful as the creator herself?! A dragon that reigned supreme over all other dragons as they looked on and cowered in fear? Such beasts were unimaginably powerful and a group of three tireless adventurers would have no way to take on such a monster. We were honestly frightened by the story and we feared for anyone who tried to embark on a journey to find such a beast. But as I said, Milas paid no heed to our warnings and went off on his own anyway. We really had no idea what to think at that point, but we knew that we [had to do] something, before Milas got himself killed.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:18 2002] Dietrich says, 'what did you do'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:19 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'He was our friend, though now we started to wonder if perhaps he had gotten too far into these explorative missions for his own good. Because he was our friend, we had to go after him to make sure he didn't do something he shouldn't. We followed his trail all over Norrath before finally finding out that he had made it to the [ancient tomb]. We found out where the tomb was and raced there to try and catch up to him.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:25 2002] Dietrich says, 'what ancient tomb'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:25 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'The walls shined dimly with a glacial velium bile the likes of which we had never seen before, not to mention the fact that they stood hundreds of feet high. I'm sure you felt the same way the first time you came here. The awe-inspiring architecture clouded our minds for a brief moment while we took it all in. Truly, we thought, Milas had stumbled onto something magnificent, albeit terrifying. We proceeded through the tomb carefully, avoiding the various golems and gargoyles that we encountered, all the while trying to locate any sign of Milas. We came to the door directly across from this room and my first thought was, ''What's in here?'' Without a moment's thought, we moved forth towards the [door] to open it.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:33 2002] Dietrich says, 'what door'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:33 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'The door was gigantic and spanned the entire reach of the hall, from floor to ceiling. It took a great force to muster it open, and what we saw when we opened the door terrified us both. Beyond the door lay a humungous golem, over three times the size of the normal golems. We tried to close the door before it noticed us, but it was too late. It charged for us, the smaller golems following behind. I tried to fend off the huge golem to try and let my beloved wife escape. Unfortunately for me, I couldn't see whether or not she was able to escape, and for all I know, she could have died right then and there. As for me, I was quickly done in by the might progenitor, and have spent the last. . . eternity here [waiting for] Ulessa.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:43 2002] Dietrich says, 'what waiting for'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:41:43 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'I'm fairly certain that my beloved wife perished in this condemned tomb shortly after me, and while that makes me sad, I still have nothing but love for her and wish to find her. I've had plenty of time over the years to come up with a way to try and escape this prison I'm in so that I might be able to find her, but unfortunately the bond between my soul and this statue are far too strong to allow me to go anywhere. I've been waiting for quite some time for someone to come to aid me in my struggles, but I don't know anyone who will help.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:42:01 2002] You say, 'I will help'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:42:02 2002] Paldar Bladesoul says 'You will? That's fantastic, this might just work. I've concocted a way to put my spirit into a mortal body, at least long enough to search the tomb for any sign of Ulessa. I've come up with the perfect way to do this, and here's what it's going to take. I'm going to need you to bring me the lifeblood of several of the creatures in the tomb. I don't wish to upset the creatures or their spirits in this tomb, so all I'll say is that the more powerful beasts will be the ones that will have what I need. Gather the ten components for me and bring them back to me, I'll be able to use them to form the creature that I can join my spirit with.'<br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mindfusioncorp.com/eq/kerafyrm/EQ000020.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>[Fri Jul 26 21:46:18 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'The newly created sentries that pop around Progenitor are now fast respawn, under 5 minute respawns.. so.. we will need some off tanking / tank mes.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:46:42 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'We can kill them, then go for the prog, but they will respawn while we are fighting, so we will need tanks to be ready to peel off and tank the sentries'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:47:50 2002] Oaklanbash tells stevent:8, 'cant dire charm'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:48:14 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'they con even to a lvl 50...'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:48:53 2002] You tell stevent:8, 'kite the baby sentrues around fountain then?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:49:14 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'Lol i could kite them too if you'de all like.. ;P'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:49:35 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'Sure thing, sounds like a good plan to me, you get prog solo'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:49:53 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'Do i have them all on me?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:50:03 2002] Snaggle tells stevent:8, 'yes'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:50:10 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'Ok great do your stuff guys'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:50:10 2002] Kargrath tells stevent:8, 'Darg has taken em downstairs.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:50:17 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'keystone cops part deux'<br><br>So Dargaz kites all the baby golems down in MoTG courtyard again while we take on Progenitor:<br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mindfusioncorp.com/eq/kerafyrm/EQ000021.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>[Fri Jul 26 21:58:56 2002] The Progenitor's corpse shouts 'This mockery of one will not be tolerated, you must not pass!'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:59:23 2002] Dietrich tells stevent:8, 'im wondering if thgat 250 ice dd was proc or ability now'<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:59:33 2002] Odull tells stevent:8, 'prismatic spear, a tome, 2 shard things'    note: &quot;prismatic&quot; items seem to be more or less equivalent to &quot;primal&quot;, however some items have slightly different classes that can use<br>[Fri Jul 26 21:59:46 2002] Dietrich tells stevent:8, 'prismatic spear?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:00:09 2002] Dargaz tells stevent:8, 'The shards are for the spectres 10 item quest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:06:59 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'tome of Innovation also, 5 ac +10 all stats +50 mana +5 all saves primary secondary'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:07:30 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'int casters'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:08:23 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'spear is Ancient Prismatic Spear '<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:08:42 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, '13/20 +5 all stats/saves +50 mana effect avatar'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:08:51 2002] Bordael tells stevent:8, 'erm +50 hp too'<br><br>So now we start clearing the library to move past there...<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:32:33 2002] Dargaz shouts, '--- Incoming --- [ a colloquial antagonist ]'<br>The tomb now has wyverns...<br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mindfusioncorp.com/eq/kerafyrm/EQ000025.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>In the hallway to the library, yet more quest NPCs:<br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mindfusioncorp.com/eq/kerafyrm/QuestNPC_3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>(missed the opening text for Remmen)<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:03 2002] Dietrich says, 'what guardians'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:03 2002] Remmen the Short says 'The gargoyles and the golems you have seen so far are the most basic of all creations in this tomb.

The very essence of his being had turned into a twisted and maligned spirit, wrought with evil and demented into hatred. These thoughts had been taken out upon dragon kin, scraping the dark thoughts and emotions upon them so that they would never sway under the righteous power of the great prismatic. However, all was not well for the dragons and they would not stand by to take the [abuse] for long.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:18 2002] Dietrich says, 'what abuse'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:18 2002] Remmen the Short says 'Kerafyrm had insulted the pride, power, and efficacy of the dragons for quite some time. However, as he continued, so continued the growls of discontent. It wasn't long before those growls turned into an uproar, filled to the brim with the courage of the Claws of Veeshan as they deemed it necessary to take action. Their action was to push back against the stringent hold of Kerafyrm through outright aggression, which led the dragons into a bloody, violent civil [war].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:23 2002] Dietrich says, 'what war'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:23 2002] Remmen the Short says 'There were some dragons and their kin that sided with Kerafyrm, defending his prophetic nature to the last. However, no matter the odds, the war that ensued ensured death on both sides. Dragon, drake, wyvern, and wyrm corpses littered the battlefield, a testament to Kerafyrm's fortitude. Despite his efforts though, the great prismatic beast was pushed back into his lair, here where you stand, and put into stasis by dragons of all elements. For years he was held in a tenuous state, almost breaking free several times, as the Claws of Veeshan oversaw the construction of a velium subsystem of [tunnels].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:31 2002] Dietrich says, 'what tunnels'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:31 2002] Remmen the Short says 'The tunnels of the final tomb, deep down below the main of the lair, where Kerafyrm was to be kept by the four most powerful elemental dragons. There he would sleep forever as the four warders kept him in a state of unconsciousness. That is the history of the ancient chaos as best I know it. As you are aware those mighty warders were disturbed and slain by those of our kind, mortal beings with the greediest of [motives].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:43 2002] Dietrich says, 'what motives'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:35:43 2002] Remmen the Short says 'The singular purpose behind all mortal beings is the acquisition of wealth. Though some would argue that they strive to gain knowledge and insight into the world, it is just a means to an end. I warn you that if you are here to that end, find it you may, but endure it you may not. You will need all the skill you can muster either way, so go now and I bid you good luck.'<br><br><br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:12 2002] Dietrich says, 'Hail, Jonas Levlellen'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:12 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'Your abilities treat you well, as you have made it past some of the most difficult automatons that have been created to date. I made it here, such as you have, but my story is one lost ages ago in the myths and legends of the lands. If time did not stand still as a spirit, I might have forgotten it myself. Perhaps you would like to [hear it]?'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:18 2002] Dietrich says, 'I would like to hear it'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:18 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'As I thought, and a wise choice I might add. Never was there a more wise choice than listening to the ramblings of an age-old spirit, infused with the knowledge of a place that time has forgotten. I was a meager journeyman in my youth, traveling the lands to fulfill my own contempt of the life I had led. I met a multitude of men and women, all of whom had desires, riches, and most importantly -- things they needed done. And so it was that I took these tasks on, journeying from one place to another, doing their deeds and reaping the rewards. However, my follies came back to haunt me on what was to be my [last mission].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:33 2002] Dietrich says, 'what last mission'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:33 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'My journeys brought me to a seemingly old man who was in need of someone like myself to go on an expedition for him. He told me that there would be riches beyond my wildest dreams if I were able to complete this, and like a fool I was instantly enchanted. He told me of a place where the frost and rime had engulfed a cavernous lair. He spoke of mighty ice beings, great dragons, and an immortal beast only legend had known to be true. He only wanted me to retrieve for him [one thing].'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:41 2002] Dietrich says, 'what one thing'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:41 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'He asked me to bring back proof that this place existed, proof that these ice beings and dragons were not just some myth, that they really did exist, and some kind of information or proof about this legendary creature. He told me that I could keep everything and anything else I found as my reward for doing this for him. And like a fool, I accepted the mission and ventured forth into the lands to find this tomb. . . my tomb. The search lasted for three years as I gained minute answers to questions on the whereabouts of a tomb larger than any constructed, one that was [home] to a mighty and powerful legendary creature. Eventually I found it, but it was more than I had expected.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:52 2002] Dietrich says, 'what home'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:36:52 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'When I found my way here I treaded lightly, unsure of what the ice beings looked like and unsure of whether they were more prominent than the dragons, or the other way around. Soon enough, I had my answer. Giant ice creatures, golems, gargoyles, beasts beyond comprehension all patrolled the halls with singular consciousness. I had found the tomb and all I needed from that point was proof. Well, proof and a good bit of treasure for my troubles. That was my last [mistake] though. As I trodded down the halls, I was aware that the frost-laden beasts were after me, in an attempt to remove me from this place. Booming voices engulfed the air around me as I ran, shouting that invaders would have their life forces extinguished and that I was not welcome here.'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:37:06 2002] Dietrich says, 'what mistake'<br>[Fri Jul 26 22:37:06 2002] Jonas Levlellen says 'Despite where I ran, there were these beasts all around me and I couldn't find a way to leave. The exits were blocked, the tunnels twisted and turned into more and more of these frightful beasts. At last I came to a door and found that behind it was a man who had wandered the tomb for a great many years. He was a gnomish fellow who seemed to be down on his luck, but seemingly alive nonetheless. I spoke with him and explained my plight, but little did I know that he was not truly a man, but an undead spirit who sought to keep those like myself from ever venturing through this tomb. It was then and there that I was struck down. . . and that is all there is to my story. Pray that the same doesn't happen to you, for that man still occupies a part of the tomb, ever-awaiting the presence of a new intruder.'<br><br>Clearing the library, we encountered lots of wyverns.
