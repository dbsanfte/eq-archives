<br>
 Okay, one more post.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Brillig says: I _don't_ think that old-style AD&amp;D is much the same as PvP in modern MMRPGs.<br>
<br>
 The thesis is not &quot;PvP = AD&amp;D DM&quot;. The thesis is that in both styles of play, you are pitted against a human-controlled conflict. Whether the conflict is in the form of orcs, kobolds, and ogres (AD&amp;D) or other online players (MMRPG), the key is that you are not just up against a computer-controlled AI.  How difficult is it to understand that simple idea? :)&quot;<br>
<br>
 Not too difficult, but a little tricky, since I (and, I suspect, others) don't accept that PvP is the same thing as &quot;human-controlled conflict&quot; (or HCCvHCC, whatever).  Now, if Scirocco had titled the thread &quot;EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on HCCvHCC&quot; or &quot;EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on human-controlled conflict&quot; then I'd've still read through the thread, though I likely wouldn't've posted (much) to it.  Thank god he didn't title it that way, though, eh?  An interesting discussion would've been lost to eternity. ;)<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

The EQ example is a good one in regards to AI, and many people get sick of the redundant AI of mobs.   UO failed because of grief players, but also because there wasnt a good system in place to reward or hunt players of grief.  Basically UO didnt balance evil vs good.  When UO split the lands into non pvp and pvp, it changed the whole game and it became much more artificial.  Some people prefer it this way, and that is why not everybody will ever be happy.  People have all kinds of different ideas of fun.<br>
<br>
I believe it lies on the system implemented, and more reward to be good for a pure PvP game to succeed.  Too many people want to be evil without consequences for their actions.  It doesnt necessarily need AI NPC's engaging in the conflict.  Just a 'controlled' environment that has consequences for grief players, as well as rewards for players to punish griefers.  The key is balancing it just right to account for the way the MMORPG audience has shown to play in UO, EQ, or AC.  Easy to say of course, but very difficult to do.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usylphan2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sylphan2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/8/01 2:39:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> I completely disagree with what was written in the first post.  I also disagree with what he was trying to say (which is different, because of the definitions of various terms).<br>
<br>
First let me talk of what was meant -- that's more important than which words were used.  I think you start with the idea that that human intelligence is more interesting, exciting, fun, and in almost every way better than computer-controlled AI.  Well yes of course.  We all know humans are a lot more dynamic and interesting than machines -- humans have more 'spice'.  Yeah, we can all agree that a MMPG (or even a tabletop RPG that's not MM) where you face human-controlled opponents will be better than one that's completely automated.  But that's a long long way from arguing that the ability to kill the characters of the other people sitting around the table is what makes the game good.<br>
<br>
Now as to the idea that every game involves human opponents:<br>
What about those choose-an-adventure books, ie 'if you attack him, turn to page 153'?  Tada... a pen and paper RPG with just one human.  Sure they suck, but they're still pen and paper RPGs.  Now check out this argument: They suck because the AI is so simple.  And the AI is so simple because there's no human GM.  But I still think it's too much of a stretch to say they suck because there's no human GM.  Rather, I argue that the AI just needs a little improvement (well ok, a LOT of improvement, maybe even near-human-level intelligence).<br>
<br>
Now on to this idea that &quot;A GM and a player are not that different&quot;.  I'll refrain from laughing AT you, but from my point of view that's laughable.  In my view, the GM is the environment.  The GM decides whether it's raining or sunny, whether the hill is grassy or muddy or sandy or steep, whether that orc's friend heard the twang of your bowstring or didn't hear it at all, whether it takes 30 seconds to light your torch or fifteen minutes.  Everything from the earth to the moon and in between is supplied by and controlled by the GM.  Also a GM goes out of his way to give the players hints and characters to roleplay with and guide them toward interesting and appropriate adventures.  And when he controls those orcs and gnolls and whatever other opponents you face he's rooting for the players, hoping his guys get trounced... and most GMs will start cheating if necessary to make sure his guys lose.  This is all very different from how other players behave in a 'PvP' situation in a game like EQ.  In a PvP situation the other players do not have any more control over heavens and earth and everything else than you do, they aren't apt to give helpful hints and guidance leading up to your encounter, and they are not rooting for you to win.  For all these reasons, I believe PvP is very very different from what all pen and paper RPGs are based on.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  I agree that a little PvP adds necessary spice to a game, and that human-controlled opponents are more fun than computer-controlled.  I agree that you have to take the griefers into account (presumably there should be some accountability, some significant consequences for being a murderer).  But I still think a D&amp;D game is a lot more like a blue EQ server, with the GM more like the server than another player.  If you really want an online game to be as dynamic as a tabletop game, try maintaining a 5 to 1 ratio of players to GMs.... now THAT just might do it.  Otherwise you'll just have to find good methods of running these games that do NOT emulate pen-and-paper RPGs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/8/01 3:46:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> &quot;What about those choose-an-adventure books, ie 'if you attack him, turn to page 153'?

Do you REALLY consider a choose-an-adventure book to be a P&amp;P RPG?  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;In my view, the GM is the environment.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, what you're saying is that in a P&amp;P RPG, the environment is controlled by human intelligence.  Thus, in essence, PvE = PvP (or HvH, if you prefer to boil it down to the essentials).   That's my point...you cannot escape the PvP element of a true P&amp;P RPG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/8/01 10:24:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/rtfm.gif width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> Sylphan2 says:  <b><i>Now on to this idea that "A GM and a player are not that different".

<br>
Since no species other than human is demonstrably capable of playing an MMRPG (though sometimes during actual gameplay I truly wonder):<br>
<br>
GM/DM->species = Human<br>
Player_in_PvP_conflict->species = Human<br>
Every_mob_you_fight_in_EQ->species = Computer<br>
<br>
Human = Human<br>
Human &lt;&gt; Computer<br>
<br>
That is not to say a DM doesn't have a different role in AD&D; yet he or she is still a human who can react dynamically to your actions, instead of just executing a predefined script.<br>
<br>
THAT is the difference, and the point of this thread.  I wonder why this is such a hard concept for everyone to grasp.<br>

<br>
1) P&P come from Sandtable rules.. If you don't know what that is you have no idea about P&P.   Yes they come from PvP but each side in any wargame has equal points to invest in forces so are equal level.  So if you want EQ to have PvP based on P&P consepts only people of EQUAL LEVEL can fight each other.. <br>
<br>
2) In P&P you could have PvP but the people have gamed together the same amount of time and have equal strength or should not be playing together. <br>
<br>
3) A DM/GM is a Referee.. If he is siding with the players it is a Monty Haul and booring.. If he sides against the players it is a no win situation and agrivating... Either way, you have a dead game which people will not come back to play.  You set up dungeons/adventures of an appropriate level and keep all dice rolls public..  Flukes in dice rolls can make the game exciting but even if the players characters die it is fair.  <br>
<br>
4) If you want to have monsters with character have a second referee (or someone who's character(s) has died) play the part of the monster.  This adds another demension to the game and is more of a true PvP but one where monsters will run and get help or sneak up on players. <br>
<br>
EQ has major power and level imbalances which Verant has tried to work around but people will still find ways to use them.   On TZ the one I hate is going through WC and having some DE Enc charm a druid to attack me (also had this happen in Qeynos with a low level NPC and a gnome enc)  When I counter attack they break the charm leaving me with multiple druids (or guards) on me.  Unless you can Identify the attacker you can't counter attack and the Guides will do nothing on that server.  <br>
<br>
I enjoy PvP but on an equal basis where if I die I know it was due to a lack of strategy or skill... Not because someone is a griefer and knows how to manipulate the game in an unfair way.   In a P&P the GM would know how to correct such a problem if it was long term or all of his players would leave and go somewhere else.  <br>
<br>
If you want MMORPG to be PvP based on P&P then you need a 6 to 1 or smaller player to GM ratio which is not profitable or have so many controls on it (soft caps) that someone will complain.   Overall though I do have to agree with many of the statement Scirocco made once you take into consideration balance of power in the game.  <p><a href=mailto:karl_saffell@hotmail.com>Kulothar</a></br>

<br>
Our guild has 2 Rivals - one an all darkie guild called XK - &lt;Xanit K'ven&gt; and the other is a multi-team guild &lt;prophets&gt;<br>
<br>
Anyhow, all my pvp experiences against XK have been fun - we kill each other readily and nearly always their is joking and fun made - but its good humoured and we have respect for each other. PvP doesn't always bring out the bad in people - it can be fun and enjoyed in a competitive manner.<br>
<br>
This is how PvP should be played, unfortunatly it isn't always the case.<br>
<br>
PvP experiences with &lt;Prophets&gt; are quite the opposite, this is a guild that is happy to let its members grief others,  when pvp between our guilds happens their is always trash talk, they are more than happy to corpse camp and train - just last night when they realised they were about to die when we were preping to zone into DN and kill their awaiting force, one of them who was in WW happily trained klandicar towards us - not that it saved them...<br>
<br>
This kind of PvP is bitter, it breeds ill feeling and contempt for each other. Unfortunatly for players that enjoy griefing, you will get them on any server that allows pvp as i'm sure you get them on non-pvp servers.<br>
<br>
As for Pen and Paper roleplaying - this is very different. The players can decide who is their GM and who they play with. If their GM isn't fair then they won't hang around to be subject to his ill treatment. The same with players, if someone is always playing a character that is out to grief all the other participants and create biterness between players, he/she will no-doubt will be asked to stop RPing with them.<br>
<br>
The problem is, their is no way to 'oust' the griefers on EQ, sure you can quit playing if you don't like Verant but players are powerless to decide who they will and won't play with...<br>
<br>
In closing, a roleplay server that was full PvP (no teams, everyone can target anyone) would be great if you could play with the right people, imo the fight of good vs evil is what adds to the spice of a RP game and can also make the game fun - especially in a game like EQ to break up the boredom of xp camps etc.... However unless there is someway to police members there will always be those that will cause grief and i suspect that the damage 'griefers' can do on a pvp server is somewhat greater than they are able to do on non-pvp ones....<br>

<br>
To the contrary, I would say from your description that it is you whose P&amp;P RPG experience has been somewhat shallow.  You appear to have GMs who woodenly played the NPCs.  You have my sympathies.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;3) A DM/GM is a Referee.. If he is siding with the players it is a Monty Haul and booring.. If he sides against the players it is a no win situation and agrivating... Either way, you have a dead game which people will not come back to play. <br>
<br>
You seem to missing something here...namely, a side.  WHO is the &quot;side&quot; against the players?  More importantly, WHO is controlling that side?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You set up dungeons/adventures of an appropriate level and keep all dice rolls public.. Flukes in dice rolls can make the game exciting but even if the players characters die it is fair. <br>
<br>
Apparently, you think the other side are the monsters/NPCs encountered, correct?  And who is controlling them?  A human.  That's my point.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if the human doing the controlling is doing a good job or a bad job.  It's still a human doing the controlling.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;4) If you want to have monsters with character have a second referee (or someone who's character(s) has died) play the part of the monster. This adds another demension to the game and is more of a true PvP but one where monsters will run and get help or sneak up on players. <br>
<br>
And if that second referee is not available, WHO IS PLAYING THE PART OF THE MONSTER?  The GM, of course.  All GMs I have ever met have been human.  Thank you for proving my point.<br>
<br>
Moreover, this is the basis for my first comment.  If your GM never had the monsters run and get help, or try to sneak up on you, you had a weak GM. You don't need a second GM, you just need a good GM in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your other points go to the issue of how to incorporate the HvH element back into a MMORPG, and thus are getting beyond the scope of this little thread.  My point is simply to get people who have a knee-jerk reaction against the term &quot;PvP&quot; to realize that &quot;PvP&quot; really is &quot;HvH&quot; (Human vs. Human), and that HvH is at the core of P&amp;P RPGs.  <br>
<br>
Human conflict (HvH) is also at the core of the nearly every good story ever told in any media, but that's a different thread...:) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphyrreeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphyrre EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/01 6:55:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> The one thing you have to keep in mind here, is that NO MMORPG will EVER be like a PnP RPG. The reason? The players. <br>
<br>
This has been said before, but I think overlooked in all these discussions. In a PnP RPG, you have real accountability for actions. I don't think you are ever going to see one member of a gaming group bring in his level 15 magic user to jump from behind a tree and kill off the rest of the group, who are all using their level 3-4 characters. If he did, he obviously wouldn't be invited back to the next session, and might even be asked to leave immediately. In fact, most DMs would allow the players ot keep their chars, saying that the incident never happened. The result? An hour or so of wasted time, and one person loses his gaming group. Now, take the same thing in an MMORPG, such as EQ. Some rules prevent a much higher level player from killing lower levels, but the same idea is in place. A higher level character ganks a bunch of low levels. Net result? Depending on the rules of that particular game, maybe loss of all items and some XP (or skill points, whatever), maybe a long corpse run for some of them, things like that. In general, just plain aggravation for people who have done nothing but stroll into the line of sight of a moron. What happens to the murderer? Usually nothing. If there are stringent consequences, such as being flagged a certain way where all the guards will KOS you, such as UO, then all they have to do is use a second account to do their normal interactions, and use that one char as their ganker. Hell, even their close friends might not know who their other char is. No matter what the &quot;consequences&quot; enforced bythe game, there are always ways around them, so in fact, there ARE NO consequences, and NO accountability. It is impossible to make it so that there are. <br>
<br>
It is impossible to get rid of &quot;grief&quot; players in a MMORPG. Because of this, it is impossible to have any kind of PvP environment that most people will enjoy. I LIKE EQ's approach. They have realized this, and simply taken PvP out of the equation. Then they made other servers to accomodate those who just couldn't live without it. I like that, because it gets all the gankers together, where they can gank each other, and I never have to deal with them at all. I don't mean to say that EVERYONE who plays on a PvP server is a grief player, but you will have to admit that the lion's share of them are, simply because they CAN'T gank people on blue servers, so they HAVE to play on the red ones. <br>
<br>
<br>
About the distinction between PvP and PvE: Many have brought up that DM vs Players is really PvP, because the DM is human, too. While that is technically true, you also must make a distinction between players and DM, even though they are all human. They play the game by different sets of rules, and for different purposes. The player play with the goal of slaying the dragon, or rescuing the princess, or some such. The DM plays with the goal of making everything work so that the players have a challenging yet accomplishable  mission. A DM has had a good game when the players succesfully &quot;win&quot; their dungeon, but just barely. You can't just lump DMs and players together into the same category simply because they are both human controlled. Even in spite of that, they are very different in terms of actual game play. Therefore, when I speak of &quot;PvP&quot; I am talking about the players that control characters (which they have been leveling, equiping, and grooming, much as Korwin pointed out) fighting and killing each other, not the players fighting alongside each other to kill human-controlled monsters the DM &quot;rolled up&quot; on the spot. There IS a difference between a level 8 cleric that's been carefully groomed over the last 4 months and a pack of hobgoblins that the DM just rolled up their hitpoints, gave a few items, and sent into battle. <br>
<br>
True, D&amp;D has the posibility of PvP. However, I have never seen it in any of my games, and I'd be willing to bet that most others haven't either. Unless and until a software company can come up with a way to duplicate the nature of D&amp;D's PvP system (i.e. it's possible for one player to kill another, but it rarely if ever happens), then I will stick with games that have no PvP, or have the option to avoid it entirely without missing any of the PvE game. I just don't think it's possible, because of something that the software developers can't control: the nature of some of the players.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usylphan2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sylphan2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/01 8:04:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;&lt;GM/DM-&gt;species = Human<br>

Wow, what a leap of logic.  So I guess all humans are equal?  Grief player = Roleplayer?  I'm afraid that drawing little arrows does not make your argument sound.  You might as well have written<br>
<br>
GM/DM-&gt;species = Human<br>
Player_in_PvP_conflict-&gt;species = Human<br>
Every_mob_you_fight_in_EQ-&gt;species = Programmer<br>
Programmer-&gt;species = Human<br>
<br>
Human = Human<br>
Human &lt;&gt; Human<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to argue that MMOGs would be a lot better (and a lot more like tabletop games) if there was a GM controlling every MOB, you'd get some agreement from me.  But jumping to the conclusion that pen and paper games are PvP is entirely unfounded.<br>

<br>
No, that's not what I said.  What I said was that in both situations you are confronting a situation that is dictated by a HUMAN BEING as opposed to a script on the computer.  The similarity between PvP and pen and paper AD&D is that the thing you are up against -- whether it's a player, the omnipotent DM/GM, or what not -- is not a computer.<br>
<br>
Is it the EXACT SAME situation in PvP and AD&D?  NO!  But THAT'S NOT THE POINT.  The point is that IN BOTH SITUATIONS A HUMAN BEING AND NOT A COMPUTER IS CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.<br>
<br>
Let's recap:<br>
<br>
In PvP, a HUMAN BEING is controlling your enemy.<br>
In AD&D, a HUMAN BEING is controlling your enemy.  (Even if it's not the same human being and even though the human being has a slightly different role.)<br>
In Everquest, a COMPUTER SCRIPT is controlling your enemy.<br>
<br>
NOW do you see how the first two are similar, and the third is different?  I hope so, because I know of no clearer way of stating it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/9/01 8:30:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;So I guess all humans are equal? <br>

No, they're not.  Not in EQ, or in any other game.  If we were all equal, I'd be able to play basketball like Michael Jordan (or, perhaps, he would play it like me...:).<br>
<br>
It's rather silly to even say it, don't you think?<br>
<br>
Moreover, you are leaping beyond my point.   Tudamorf (who probably has no hair left on his head at this point due to frustration) has accurately summed it up.   It's undeniable that a GM is HUMAN, I hope.  <br>
<br>
Whether the humans involved are &quot;equal&quot; (whatever that means), or good or bad at the game, is irrelevant.<br>

<br>
I agree that P&amp;P is human vs human....however, the flavor is so far removed from MMORPG human vs human that it is causing many to try to qualify your definition a bit more.  <br>
<br>
P&amp;P human vs human is not adversarial.  The GM human is generally cooperating with the players in his own way to help the story flow.  Not to mention, controlling the surrounding environment to help achieve that goal.<br>
<br>
MMORPG human vs human is very adversarial.  The opposing player has no reason whatsoever not to make your experience as horrible as possible, and also has no control over other characters or the environment.<br>
<br>
However, even given the above statement, there are some P&amp;P games that might fit EXACTLY into the PvP style of MMORPG.   I have encountered DMs that consistantly kill parties for no good reason.  For all intents and purposes....a &quot;griefer&quot;. ;)<br>

<br>
It is adversarial.  But not griefer-style. <br>
<br>
The GM takes the role of different adversary (or adversaries) through the game.  This provides the conflict that is present in most stories.  It not only helps the story flow, it CREATES the story.<br>
<br>
We are in agreement that the HvH element in P&amp;P RPGs usually works well, I believe.  And that the HvH element in MMORPGs often does not.<br>
<br>
I previously said that &quot;accountability&quot; was one key element to the success of HvH.  As you note, if you have a sadistic GM, then you have a &quot;griefer.&quot;  In the P&amp;P RPG world, people just stop playing if that person is a GM.  That GM suffers appropriate consequences as a result of his or her actions.<br>

Meaning playing on a level playing field, where each player plays by the same rules. And on this level playing field, one player pits his skills against the other in order to obtain a goal that only one of them can obtain. Chess, football, Quake Deathmatch, etc. <br>
<br>
PnP AD&amp;D, in relation to DMs and Players, does not fall into this catagory. DMs do not follow the rules, they make them and break them in order to provide a fun adventure for the players. <br>
<br>
If football allowed for one side to freely adjust the scoreboard in order for the other team experience a close game that they eventually would win, i wouldnt consider it Player vs Player any longer. Would you? Sure, yould could isolate a given play, and point out that that defensive player stopped that offensive player, therefore its PvP. But in the context of the entire game its not. <br>
<br>
DMs and Players play by different rules and have different goals. To me, this totally destroys any notion that the interaction between these 2 is PvP. While a DM might step into a role whose purpose is to enter into combat with the Players, his goal is not the same as the players nor are the rules he follows. <br>
<br>
Also, i would like to point out that even computer AI can simulate some NPCs equal to a human controlled AI. Low level undead, for example, attack the nearest creature without regard to life or limb. Easy for a computer to handle that. <br>
<br>
Anyways, it all boils down to Player-versus-Player not having a concrete definition. Therefore its open to interpretation. While you can argue what it means to you, it does not mean that you are correct. <br>
<br>
Its my opinion that D&amp;D was not &quot;based&quot; on PvP in any way, shape, or form.<br>

<br>
The &quot;level playing field&quot; is a myth as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
First, there is the obvious truth that the humans involved are not equal.  Some have faster reflexes.  Some are stronger.  Some are more flexible.  Some are more intelligent.  Some have more practice.  Some have better equipment or training. Some have more knowledge of the particular game.  These differences apply to any game, anywhere. <br>
<br>
In fact, I daresay that it is these differences that make the game worthwhile.  To play and to watch. <br>
<br>
Second, there are additional technological differences particular to online computer games.  One player has a cable modem, another is still using their telephone line.  One has a top of the line computer with a fast video card and lots of memory, other still are clunking around with PIIIs and voodoo 2s (or older, god forbid).  Even with the exact same equipment set-up, geographical differences can make a huge difference in the quality and speed of their connection.   <br>
<br>
Fantasize all you want.  Ain't no such thing as a &quot;level playing field&quot; in an online game.  None of the games you listed have a truly level playing field, especially Quake.  Chess, perhaps, comes closest, but even there there is a difference: white goes first and has a slight advantage thereby.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Its my opinion that D&amp;D was not &quot;based&quot; on PvP in any way, shape, or form.<br>
<br>
Then you must have been playing with yourself....:)<br>

<br>
Actually, it's not.  A level <b>playing field</b> does not equate to equal skills, but rather to equal opportunity.  If went in a 1 on 1 game of basketball with a pro, I would lose horribly because of the differences in physical makeup, skills, and experience -- but the playing field would certainly be equal.<br>
<br>
PvP <b>is</b> about a level playing field, and that is what makes it fun.  Sure, differences in experience, reaction time, and quality of internet connection will affect performance, but each player is subject to the same rules established by the game server.  In some games (HLCS, Q3, and the like), the whole aspect of character development is removed entirely just to make the characters even more equal, in turn making PvP more fun, because it becomes more of a test of l337 fragging skillz.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't mind PvP, so long as there is a way to opt out, without missing a Huge part of the PvE environment of a game.<br>
<br>
I know, for realism, RP, competitiveness, whatever, PvP needs to be an option. There are many people who will not be happy unless they can engage in PvP.<br>
<br>
However, on the other hand, there are those such as myself that really have absolutely no interest in PvP. We will not be happy if we are forced into PvP, or if we will miss large portions of the PvE game by avoiding PvP.<br>
<br>
Its a fairly tough dilemma.<br>
<br>
Those in the PvP side of the equation, I have heard many say that a non-PvP game is no fun to them. Some also claim that they should be rewarded more for being in a PvP area, due to risk/reward.<br>
<br>
My 2 cents: If PvP is more fun to you, then you already have the reward you deserve from the additional risk you are in. I don't think that anyone should recieve more XP, Loot, or anything else of that nature because they are willing to engage in PvP. A Title, or a ranking of some sort, fine. But nothing that would have any influence in the PvE system.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I feel that EQ had a decent approach, except that it was impossible to switch from PvP to PvE areas. AO seems to have a good idea, although Nobody knows how the little details will work yet. UO? Well, I quit UO the day EQ was released. Back then, it had a horrid PvP system. In fact, were it not for that game and its flawed initial implementation of PvP, there would likely be many many more gamers willing to give PvP a second chance. <p><center><B>Meddik,</B> Rebel Doctor
