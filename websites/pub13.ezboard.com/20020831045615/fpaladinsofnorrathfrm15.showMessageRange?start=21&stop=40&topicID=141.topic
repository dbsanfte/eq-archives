It makes the encounter seem cheap when you know you can do it anytime you want with the right number of a certain class and you dont' need any other class.<br>
<br>
Take gore for example.  My guild worked on her for like 3months trying to figure out what to do and how to do it.  Now along comes a group, 6 people, and they do what my guild couldn't do with 30+ people.  Could you stick 6 of any other class together and take down gore?  Manaburn has turned gore into a chump.  It trivialized that encounter.  <br>
<br>
When you have manaburn wizards as part of a raid doing their part then I have no problems at all.  When the raid consists only of wizards I have problems.  In small numbers on high end encounters manaburn is not overpowered.  In fact it's a very unique skill and is well deserved.  On the 16-32k dragons/boss mobs though it's overpowering.  <br>
<br>
Solutions for this problem (never complain unless you have an idea to fix it) would be to make a minimum level mob that manaburn will work on.  Something like 65-70   whatever verant decides is feasible and won't trivialize encounters.  Another option would be to allow no more then 3 manaburns to land per 30 secs or so.  This probably wouldn't work as good as the level limit though.  Another option would be to only allow a set number of manaburns to be cast on a single mob.  Depending on mobs level would depend on the number of manaburns.  Example would be a lvl 60 16k mob could only have one manaburn land on it.  A lvl 75 200k mob could have 10manaburns land, or you could just make the number of manaburns be a percantage of the mobs total hitpoints.  ensuring that manaburn could do no more then 25-30% of the mobs health.  Not sure what would be the best solution, but atleast it would fix the way manaburn trivalizes some encounters. <p>Chavr Wyrmbane<br>

This really encapsulates the worst of the poor attitude I see on this board.  The thinking that &quot;this problem doesn't affect me personally, nor my friends, nor anyone I hang around with, so it doesn't matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
Believe me, there are still low level people playing EverQuest.  My guild has a member who has been playing since release, and his highest level character was a 34 bard.  Now he's playing a paladin, and having a blast, and will probably be planes-capable in another month.<br>
<br>
Just because you and your guild and your friends and all of your twinks aren't affected negatively by this issue doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of people who ARE negatively affected by this issue.  And if there ARE lots of people negatively affected by this problem, then it should be changed.  If you have any interest in the truth, then you would agree.<br>

It has:<br>
<br>
1. Low HP, I have heard ~90k ish, which would jive with roughly a dozen typical MB wizards.<br>
2. EASILY accessible.  You just have her harmonied and play /gems 15 feet from her till the other MB wizards arrive.<br>
3. You engage her, not the other way around = Sont takes MB damage before even thinking of chewing a wizard.<br>
4. Ridiculous AE damage output via 'proc AE of doom'.<br>
<br>
<br>
You could also kill Sont with 3 clerics, 2 warriors, 1 bard, and 10 rangers with TS and good bows, EQ, and AM 3 (these being rarer than MB wiz however atm).  The rangers will probably get ~2k DPS collectively.  Enough to drop Sont in well under a minute with the rangers *never* taking a single point of AE damage.<br>
<br>
The 'problem' here isn't mana burn specifically.  Its a mob that is highly significant (in this case with a ST key, RoK dragons because of Epics) in which FAST damage &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sustainable damage.  This is frankly something that various classes (and especially VI) either is ignorant of, chooses to ignore, or is silently using to their own ends.  Where they 'error' is that the same strategies that VI is assumingly using to battle 'zerg' forces (nasty damage/curse/charm/etc AEs, ridiculous key quests) only FURTHER impairs there attempt at making raid forces more proportional in composition.<br>

&quot;but it's hard to gather that many wizards at same time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;At this point in time, it's not very feasible to gather 12+ mb wizzies at one time on a regular basis. &quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah ... until they learn they can PL their bank accounts. Getting 4 people together for a half hour once a day for a pretty much gaurenteed piece of dragon loot (Kunark dragons drop something like 4 items plus highish level spells, no? That's 1 piece of loot + spells for each) isn't going to be hard. What is to stop 4 people from deciding to cut off and monoplize the only 52+ source for paladin epic books, all colors of dragon scales (including Green), and whatever else?<br>
<br>
Nothing. Absolutely nothing except level 59 and some AA points, which any asshole can get.<br>
<br>
Hell, even if you rather piss on Kunark dragon loot, I'm sure the cleric epic is still something nice that ANY level guild would appreciate their clerics having. Too bad, 4 people can perma kill the SF Ragefire now making it a much bigger pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Now we start getting into First brood dragons. I wonder how much a Sleeper's Tomb key can sell for ...<br>
<br>
It will happen, and it is already starting to. I would like MB not to be changed, it is extremely powerful and useful. However, with great power comes great responsibility. And it only takes a handful of greedy assholes to abuse MB enough to the point where it can affect an entire server. That is what most people have a problem with. Not the power, but the irresponsibility that some of these wizards are displaying. <p><center>

If you would take a look at my profile you would notice that I am only lvl 45, I have over 50 days played on my char in the past year, now I am not saying that this problem doesnt affect me( if wizzies just start knocking out all the dragons that drop the burnt and frost books, then I am straight out of luck) but the truth is Manaburn doesnt affect us all in a big way. The truth is that for less effort than it takes to kill some of the Kunark or old world things, you can get better items in Velius or Luclin for the same or maybe less amount of trouble. For example you cant get planar gear, fine you just get 2 groups together and head to kael to camp armor. I think were making a big deal out of something that can only be used in a handful of encounters and if we continue on talking about MB like we are now I am affraid we will get wizzards severely nerfed. Manaburn is not useful in a regular raid encounter, they can do more damage during a regular fight just using their normal nukes, if they have it nerfed then they would have just thrown away 27 points for nothing.<br>

What you've said in this thread is that because wizards had a hard time getting into exp groups in the past when they sucked as bad as hybrids then it's okay for Manaburn to completely screw so many middle tier guilds out of Kunark mobs.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Back then Wizard is low lvl Magicians without pet...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

WTF does this have to do with Manaburn AGAIN? You keep posting the fact that wizards suck in regular exp groups, which is true unless they have major FT, c3, and bard mana song. It just points out that you have absolutely no clue that there is a different between Manaburn being too powerful on Kunark mobs and wizards in regular exp groups.<br>

NEWSFLASH! There are other servers besides yours. Just because YOUR server doesn't have lots of level 60 wizards doesn't mean others do. Wake up please.<br>
Getting 20+ AA is a joke. People had 100 AA points a month after Luclin opened before they started nerfing down AE capable zones as well as how long it took to get an AA point. Just because YOU can't get those AA points doesn't mean others can't.<br>

Manaburn is A-OKAY because Magicians have pets, the draught series doesn't do a lot of damage in one cast, wizards used to have a hard time getting exp, and my brother is a wizard. Wouldn't be surprised if those ARE the reasons behind VI's logic to allow wizards to parade around filling up their bank accounts with Book of Scales, Dragon Scales, RBBs, CoFs, and Kunark Greaves.  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3088>Radiation Contamination</a><BR>

The Donal's-like nerf is a pretty good idea, it would prevent MB from turning into a insta-death ability while still allowing it to provide a significant advantage to a raid. Or perhaps, further MB's after the 1st one would only deal 1/4 or 1/2 damage?

These encounters are already trivial. You can kill most kunark dragons with about 9 well geared people with no MB, same difference.<br>

<br>
my thoughts really are because while im sure there are plenty of wizards who give the epic pieces to guildmates etc, im sure there are those out there that only want to profit in a big way from it, and thats not cool imo, using their skill to make money and deprive people of epic pieces, or a chance at them, now i realize that most probably arent this way, but there are some bad seeds out there.<br>

Its not so much that a group of wizards can MB a high end mob that is the problem.  The problem is its a no fail, no risk kind of situation.  If you try to take out any uber mob even with a group that is overkill you still can mess up and wipe out.  You still engage the mob and with a failed CH, a LD something of that sort you are in real trouble.  With a MB squad this doesn't exist.  You take along enough wizards that you can drop the mob without any crits and then one more in case of early aggro death.  MB as far as i've seen is irresistable.  It doesn't fizzle, it can't fail, you count down from 3 and right click one time.  The mob doesn't react, it doesn't have a chance to do any damage to you and it will DIE no matter what happens.<br>
<br>
That is what meant by it trivializing the encounter.  If you have enough wizards its imposible to fail barring an early aggro mess up, which every raid has to worry about in addition to the hundreds of other factors that can cause the raid to fail. <p><a href =http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569>Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a>
