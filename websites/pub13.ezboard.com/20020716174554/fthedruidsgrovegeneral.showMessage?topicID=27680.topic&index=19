my nukes aren't going to let me solo in any reasonable manner and they add very little to a group (in an experience group where i have spare mana they just aren't adding up to any serious damage, and in raids where i have no mana to spare on crummy nukes i don't ever even have a one memorized).  "Basically it would be a druid trading all offesive abilities for healing. Would such a class interest people?"...of course!  it'd interest 99% of the people that are currently playing clerics.  these folks are arguing that it wouldn't interest people that are playing druids, and i think that is probably correct, but except for the tiny percentage of clerics who really ought to be playing paladins, if you posted this idea on EQCleric you would be overwhelmed with cries of "genius!" <p><b><a href="http://www.theoutwardeye.com/">&lt;Outward Eye&gt;</a><br><font face="tahoma"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23942" target="_blank">Brazzo</a>, L53 Cleric<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23987">Grazzo GrubGrabber</a>, L42 Druid<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94223" target="_blank">Vexxal</a>, L37 Warrior</font><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=144397" target="_blank">Hexxal</a>, L35 Shadowknight<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23993">Aaalpha [Lute]</a>, L18 Bard</font></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umappysassenfrass.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mappy Sassenfrass</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/22/02 7:07:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27680.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maybe EQ needs a new @#%$ </span><hr size=1> Complete Heal AND Mezz?<br>

Clerics, ultimately, don't get groups because they have buffs, or even rezzes...they get them because they have CH.  Enchanters aren't ever REQUIRED because of clarity, haste, or slow...but they are occasionally required for mezzing.<br>
<br>
Throw in all the rest of the spells...ports, sow, snare did you say?, inv, etc, and you have a pretty uber template that could make clerics obsolete.   Not too mention druids.  Enchanters or shaman would still have a place in this group, for clarity/haste/slow.<br>

These my guild calls dr00ds.  They basically became druids in order to solo, farm things, level faster and generally just be annoying by training people while quad kiting.  Then there are what I call &quot;real druids&quot;,  people who were attracted to the class for the roleplay aspect (ie. people who like animals and nature), people who like to heal but not ALL DAY LONG bleh, people who like to move about quickly, do a little of everything (throw a heal here, a nuke there), people who truly like to help others (buffs, ports etc.), and yes, people who do like to solo when the mood strikes.<br>
<br>
What's wrong with some classes being able to solo well and some not as efficiently?  Classes are supposed to be different.  Druids are not the only class that can solo well, necros and mages are also very good at it.  In fact in the high end game (well equipped level 60 players) just about every class can solo.  In fact, I can't think of a level 60 class who can't solo.  With dire charm, chanters are great at it.  Melee's no problem with fungi tunics and the AC and hp's they have.<br>
<br>
Druids are a viable class and IMO at this point in time are pretty well in balance with a few minor exceptions.  Frankly, if they took the druid class away, I wouldn't play EQ.  Melee is fun for a while....I have a 53 monk and a 51 rogue that I eventually got bored with, exception being pulling with my monk.  Cleric?  no thanks, insanity within a week I would estimate.  I'm not THAT nice.  Wizard?  boooooring, to be honest, I really don't *want* to kill a dragon with 4 or 12 people and don't feel it should even be going on but that's another story.  I don't like pure casters anyway, any of them, they are so helpless, a stiff wind will kill them.<br>
<br>
Exaggerating a bit here, but my point is that I love being a druid.  I like doing a little bit of everything and don't mind not being best at one thing.  Solo?  Yes I do, mostly root/dot variety.  However I grew up as a group druid.  The first time I solo'd was level 35.  And  I basically only solo'd during hell levels after that.  *shrug*  I don't think &quot;druids&quot; are the problem, &quot;dr00ds&quot; are.  Find a way to get them out, oh and take away the jerks in the all the other classes too cause they are there...<br>

<br>
I did a survey of class populations on Bristlebane saturday evening at prime time.<br>
<br>
Level 60 druids? 19.<br>
Level 60 every other class? Too many to count.<br>
<br>
Then I went down the levels from 59 to 1 and compared the relative numbers of druids compared to any other class and you know what? They were all basically equal.<br>
<br>
There were not any more druids than warriors. In fact there were many more warriors by far.<br>
<br>
I really think the Druids are an over populated class myth is just that. At least it's not a reality on Bristlebane. Not sure about other servers.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think the druid class is full of jerks and poor players. I don't think the druid class is any easier to play than any other class. I think class difficulty discussions are hilarious. They are all pretty much easy to play. Any 12 year old kid can master any of the classes so folks lets not fool outselves.  <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=194540">Tuved</a>

<br>
The first year to 2 years, EQ was FULL of druids and at least 1 in 10 (if not more) were jerks, powergamers, farmers and camp stealers with little regard for thier own reputation or the druid class.  Most of this was even before quad kiting which extended this reputation with a whole new generation of jerks.  I am guessing but I suspect most other classes enjoyed a much better ratio of jerks to good folks.. maybe 1 in 50 or even 1 in 100.  Mainly because most other classes required much more dedication and even skill to level successfully so jerks got bored and switched to the easier classes so they leveled quicker.  Druids and Necros fit this bill but necros didnt get the versatility of druids so they usually picked druids.  Muliply that by the fact that druids were easily the most played class in that time period and you end up with a very bad class reputation.<br>
<br>
A simple survey today wouldnt reflect that since most of them seem to have left the game.  Regardless, druids are still paying for those early days in the eyes of other classes and perhaps even Verant although I doubt they would ever admit it.<br>
<br>
That is what I referred to and other then the odds (which I guesstimated), the rest is pretty much historical fact in EQ. <p><table border="0">

Actually Scirocco what I am suggesting is that I am willing to bet 90% of the current druid population would have chosen another class (most likley shaman, cleric or wizard) if the druid class as we know it didnt exist.  They wouldn't have known any different.<br>
<br>
If the druid class was modified to be less "convienent" in EQ2 (how is debatable), I bet upwards of 50% would still choose the class and the other 40% would choose something similar and the 10% would still not play.  I dont think it would cause the mass exdus you think it would.<br>
<br>
If that leaves some folks like yourself out of EQ2 then so be it... you have contributed alot to the class, no doubt about it, but it is obvious you are looking for your cake and eating it to... <br>
<br>
You want to be able to solo effectivly in some remote location on the moon, get a request from guildies to go raid and be able to turn around and within minutes port, SoW up and run to the raid and then enjoy a viable, and even unique, role on that raid.  No other class has all that currently so why should the druid class get it? <p><table border="0">

1. Druids having more jerks, no way.<br>
(Now how are you going to measure that?)<br>
<br>
I had all manner of examples of jerkery, but I erased it. You all know that a jerk is a jerk. <br>
They could be playing their druid main or monk alt, <br>
or<br>
their monk main or druid alt.<br>
<br>
They FD train you or pick off your pulls it does not matter.<br>
<br>
2. Druid population. Lots of classes that appeal to people begging things, or asking for for help go anon.<br>
Tough to get accurate numbers.<br>
<br>
3. The class you propose. I pity them if they can not lock down all the mobs... can you imagine the aggro.<br>
Not to mention there is no point of a new class at this stage. <br>
Beastlord is just one big mistake to begin with, why introduce another class that will be screaming broken in a few months when you aint fixed what you got.<br>
