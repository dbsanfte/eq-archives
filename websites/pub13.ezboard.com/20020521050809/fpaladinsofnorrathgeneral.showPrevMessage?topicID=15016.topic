I'm just gonna quote it, if it doesn't seem to fit all together here, probably because I made guild references here and there:<br><br>"I'm switching into paladin mode right now, and I can because I have a 53 one who was my main for a very long time before Takesta was even created =oP Sit back and enjoy.<br><br>( note: this is a debate conversation, I am not attacking anyone! )<br><br>Why would a group want any other race? Okay, race doesn't *matter* with starting stats. There are enough items and mods out there to make any race a good whatever-class-you-pick. Here's a reason for personal use: maybe people don't *want* to play a halfling paladin. Not saying that they'll look *stupid* or anything, but you know that every person out there is going to make one. I have an Erudite female paladin for one reason: originality. You do /who all erudite paladin and you get nada, or only Syta if she's on. You can *see* her coming and know exactly *who* she is. That, to me, is more important than good beginning stats. Besides, it goes against the RP aspect. I know that no one on EQ gives a flip about the lore of Norrath, or the Role Playing atmosphere, but there are a few of us who keep updates.<br><br>Let's talk about gnome paladins, first. This is just stupid. Stupid with a real biiiig S. The gnomes in EQ are pretty much the equivalent of AD&D / DragonLance / TSR tinker gnomes. And yes, I compaire EQ to TSR a lot because they used a lot of their characters (aka: Dark Elves were purely TSR before EQ, and they did have a silent partnership when EQ went live because of their char use). In D&D, only humans could be paladins. This doesn't have to do with a God thing, that's a different story. Point is, gnomes don't fit the mold of an "EQ Paladin." They clash horribly. It's like giving a tinker a Soulfire (aka: a toothpick with flames, ooo), shoving Ro armor on it and trusting it to do valorous things. Riiight. 10 to 1 he's gonna probably just sit down and tinker it into a flame thrower or something else instead with his time. Install an AC unit into his Ro armor =OP They don't have the mentality for it, not for the scale that people will be using them. Yeah, maybe *one* or two gnomes may be different and born with more sense, but er? You know the server is going to go nuts over this.<br><br>And how the heck are they supposed to do the armor quests, anyway? The faction with them is going to be nasty if they plan to ever do the Ro armor, or Soulfire series.<br><br>Oh, wait, silly me. They'll just be twinked... lol.<br><br>Onto Halflings. I really don't see the good in starting stats with all the items you have out there, unless you plan on fighting naked? If you really want to pick straws, dwarfs are technically the best starting stats -- always have been, always will be. Does that mean the whole server should switch? Er, I haven't seen a dwarf paladin in ages. They have the strength, they have the wisdom, they have battle power. Yadda yadda.<br><br>My Erudite *without* nice gear like some people have (aka: valorium, frozen royal velium, etc) has more strength and wisdom than a lot of others. Why? She has the shield of stalwart seas to boost every thing she was lacking in (str and sta out the arse, not to forget ac and ultrivision which is *still* one of the best shields in the game for paladins -- only erudites can wear). She wields a rather mean sword, and is hardly out of mana with the right mind buffs. Most of all, no one else looks like her.<br><br>In the RP sense, Halflings being paladins is now an insult to paladins. Halflings, generally in RP sense, don't even like adventure. If they could stay home in their nice warm houses they'd be just as happy. Sure, you have the warrior who will go out for 'em, or the rogue (they're the best rogue class starting stat wise for a reason... well, were until the cats came out), etcetcetc, but they don't have the personality for it. Maybe for rangers, that sort of makes sense, but not for paladins. And no offence to the halflings out there, but can you *really* see one of these furry footed guys wielding a fiery avenger at a mob of evil shouting "Back into the depts with thee, by the will of (er.. Karana?) I vanquish your evil deeds and bring this realm closer to safety!!!" Um... no.<br><br>So, to sum it up, no I don't think other races are "screwed." No, I don't think any groups or guilds would actually *pre*fer halfling paladins just for their starting stats. If you want to make one, by all means, have at it! I'm just saying that the other races are just as good, and have far more RP merit in the long run. Humans, definately. Erudites, makes sense since they're a higher form of humans. Dwarfs, yeah -- they can carry the valor thing. Half-Elves, iffy, but still half human so it can be spoken for.<br><br>There was a reason Gnomes and Halflings were never paladins. This is only Verant's sad little attempt to get more interest in the game from players who are starting to get bored again."<br><br>Er, yeah, night =) <p><br><p align="center"><IMG SRC=http://members.aol.com/TheEveofIce/LTakesta.jpg><br><font size="1"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9972>Takesta Xantharath</a>, 60th Level Phantasmist of the <a href=http://www.prexus.com>Prexus Server</a> <br> . . .

Halflings can either sneak and move(useful still no doubt) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> OR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can only hide and stay still.<br><br>While this will still make halfling useful in certain situations if you combine this first limitation with the fact that they only get 40 skill in this to start then its not as big an issue anyhow.<br><br>ALSO only rogues can use hide to get a level of invisibility beyond spell invis by using hide.  All other classes/races that have hide, have only spell casting level invis which means that a NToV wipeout will still take the pally with it since many of those mobs see invis.<br><br>In otherwords the halfling invis is a convenience mainly at the low levels to allow the paladin to hide while medding and maybe hide if things are getting tight around him and he needs to med/sit regen.<br><br>And as far as uberness of which race makes the best pally?  I don't think it matters in the long run.  Its the player behind the toon that makes things work and when you add in all the nice stat gear out there stats are very correctable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upraetorthecrusader.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Praetor the Crusader</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/02 7:18:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14917.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Halfling palys? are other races screwed?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Lol . in a wipeout situation.

This will not have a huge impact with one exception. They will be able to sit and med in relative peace in the karana's with out every lion in the zone stopping by for a bite. Racial abliitys do not improve. They cannot move while hiding or it breaks. Sneak will help to adjust faction to indiffernt if they come up behind an NPC, very limited use otherwise.Frankly i don't expect to see many Halfling pally's, wrong mind set for them. Same with the gnomes. I personally expect the gnome SK's and the halfling rangers to be quite popular but pally's in either race very rare.
