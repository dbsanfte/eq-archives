<br>
The Druid Epic, whats really epic about it...Nothing really.  One of the easiest epics to obtain, aside from the annoying eternal camping.  Today I see a level 51 druid complete his epic, and proceed to brag on how he did absolutely nothing for it...and how his friends all multi-quested the pieces to him, aside from a few of the easier ones.  He even said the create date on his druid was February of this year...somehow, this makes me feel sick.  I feel nothing but contempt for this druid, who has done nothing for it really.  I can't respect him as another druid.  It disturbs me that other druids will see him wielding an epic and consider him a model for themselves.  <br>
<br>
I wish multi-questing was nerfed just for this reason.  I couldn't feel respect for myself if I had everyone do everything for me.  Maybe I'm a little jealous, that may be true.  He must have some good friends to multi-quest all the items for him(actually, I believe he traded for many of the items...), but on the other hand, can he feel any sense of accomplishment at all at completing his epic...  Just feels wrong.<br>
<br>
Granted, multi-questing is also a great boon and hate to see it go too.  <br>
<br>
I've seen a complete stranger give up her Kedge Robe for a friends Ragebringer, because it was his last piece he needed to complete his epic.  She didn't know him, and left with a smile.  <br>
<br>
I've seen a ranger give up his VS stone just so that another druid could complete her NWS.  Simply because they were good friends.<br>
<br>
I don't know what I'm getting at.  just rambling I suppose.<br>
Ignore me.<br>

<br>
Verant can design quests to eliminate multiquesting if they so choose.<br>
<br>
The Enchanter Epic is almost entirely non-muliquestable. Any time you have to combine something in a container it eliminates the multiquesting. <br>
<br>
If they nerf multiquesting it will be the single most devestating nerf to the game. <p><table style=filter:glow(color=#FFFFFF

Better than endisly camping alone...what does that prove? your a good camper? You got loads of time to waist?<br>
<br>
Point is if you dont have the time to waist camping (RL) you cant get an epic if multi questing doesnt exist.<br>
<br>

ps. I did it the long way too but I dont mind if people do it either way up to them. I also feel I acheived the epic rather than somene got it for me (other than guild help for the big mobs which I thank)<br>

<br>
Kind of funny really. I guess if I felt the epic was some kind of status symbol, I would probably be upset, too. Then again, I've never really been one for status symbols. <br>
<br>
Personally, I want the epic for one reason: It's the best primary hand item in the game, period. I don't give a crap about status, I want those stats, and that effect. Looks cool, too, and that's always a plus. <br>
<br>
It personally wouldn't bother me if my friends multi-quested the whole thing for me. Just so you know, I haven't multi-quested a single part of it. I soloed most of it, and got help almost exclusively from my guild for the stuff I couldn't solo. Got VS last night, and my Elaborate Scimitar. Only Faydeder to go! <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

<br>
We have a monk in our guild that was a druid 80% done with her epic. She 99% retired as the druid and now that I have decided to work on mine has offered me what she has completed as her druid.<br>
<br>
Did I ask her to do this? No.<br>
Was I flattered and over joyed when she offered? Hell yes!<br>
<br>
For the last 6-9 months I have passed on my epic and its components to assist other people with theirs. We have 3 rangers with VSR stones. I have helped kill old Faydedar twice now. I have chosen not to run my guild and friends around for my own personal gain, but instead spent this time running guild and friends around for the benefit of others.<br>
<br>
I have put in more time on epics than I care to even think about and it was a HUGELY nice gesture for her to allow me to shortcut a lot of mine since she has no use for it anymore.<br>
<br>
Yes, the 51 druid that did this and bragged about the lack of personal effort is an ass in my eyes for belittling the work of others to get that for him - and as Scirocco says let it go - I on the other hand am benefitting from great friendships and relationships to get mine.<br>
<br>
Multiquesting is a two edge sword but as others mentioned there are some benefits and this is a group interaction world.<br>
<br>
I know people around me that have:<br>
Given up Kedge robes.<br>
Multiquested the ink part of the enchanter quest.<br>
Freely given up AC rings for guild members (I dont mean camp and farm them)<br>
Given up the Quillmane cloaks<br>
Multiquest PoA stones because the people needing couldnt go due to RL constraints<br>
and so on and so <br>
<br>
For every one bad multiquesting story there are probably 50 good ones where partnerships and comraderie have proven to be good things and not evil exploits.<br>
<br>
There is kindness in Norrath and can come from all places. See that staff I carry? I didn't buy it, trade for it, or loot it. When a reader of this board got his epic he gave it to me because he knew I had wanted nothing more than to be a staff carrying druid all my life. So he gave me his Earthcrafters he was no longer using.<br>
<br>
I will still be a staff carrying druid most of the time - anytime but down and dirty fighting I will carry that staff proudly, but stats and resists and the desires of my guild members and friends meant I really needed to work on this epic thing to move forward with Halls of Testing and other locations similar.<br>
<br>

I needed the VS stone.  The day my guild finally gets a shot at VS I am not able to make it due to real life commitments.

<br>
There is nothing wrong with multi-questing. You may not like that fact that some folks get their Epic before you but it really helps for those trying their best to get an Epic and at times can't be there to loot the piece they need. <p><table border="0" width="545" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<br>
The NWS is not a status symbol to me.  More of a representation of what I and the friends that stuck by me went through for it.  I can look at my NWS and think of how much I love my friends and how much they love me.  I see other druids with the NWS and I just feel proud of them.  Yet I see this one druid, who proceeds to brag on how he basically did nothing for it and it just put me out of the loop.  In this one instance, I wished multi-questing to be nerfed, but you take away the bad you also take away the good.<br>
<br>
The Druid epic as it is now is not that hard and becoming common now.  Very true.  Yes, alot of it boring camping and more then 1/2 of it can be done solo.  Not very epic either I might add, except an epic camp, lol.    I too have spent my time camping Faydedar the old way, lost him twice to despawning him while kiting 2+hrs and was never able to get him agian until he was triggered. (Maybe I'm a bad kiter, but on no sleep for 2 days, not sure many would be ;p)<br>
<br>
Multi-questing.  No I'm not against it.  As with everything though, you can see the good and the bad, its just the bad that tends to linger on and which you ponder over.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all of your opinions and I'm already forgetting about this druid.    I may feel that he doesn't deserve it, but maybe someone else does.  Friends are a good thing, probably the best thing EverQuest has to offer.  A chance to make hundreds if not thousands of friends.  This druid simply won't be one of mine (I know, conceited, but hey)<br>
<br>
