Quote from Abashi:<br>
<br>
Well, that was a lot of reading. Besides one meeting, all I've had time to do today is read these class threads and write up very long replies. So let's get on with it! <br>
<br>
In general there are few 'balance' issues in this thread. There are several problems, but things (even seemingly important ones, like the whole Admiral Akbar line of spells) aren't balance issues. And I want to look at the balance issues first. <br>
<br>
A bazillion hit points: The biggest balance issue that I see is the problem that we've given the purely mana dependent wizard in Velious. Once the mana is gone and the enemy is only partially wounded, the wizard is no longer contributing to the fight (except that he is meditating in preparation for helping out later). I see this as the single most important issue facing the wizard class as a whole. And, as I'm discovering with most classes, it's mostly a post 50th level issue. <br>
<br>
I've seen two basic approaches to a solution to this problem. Unfortunately, both are very dramatic (though it may require a dramatic change to rectify this issue). One is simply to increase the wizard's mana reserve, the other is to create a new line of spells that does a percentage of damage based on the current hit points of the target. Honestly, I don't like either one. Raising the mana pool would be a terrific balancing problem. This not only increases the potential damage output of the wizard while he's fighting the bazillion hit point enemy, but at all other times as well. I can't really see this working. <br>
<br>
I admit that the % damage spell idea is interesting. And it does target the problem a lot more specifically. This also seems like an idea that could cause troublesome balancing issues, but far fewer than the mana pool increase. It would require a ton of work, assuming that this sort of spell is even possible… <br>
<br>
There is a third idea that I have, but I can't tell you about because it is based on things that you folks don't get to know (sorry). But it is not too far from the percentage damage idea anyhow. <br>
<br>
Regardless, this is the main concern that I have about balancing the wizard class. And it will probably remain at the top of the wizard list. <br>
<br>
The other more general issue is about the whole level limit cap on wizard (and everyone else's for that matter) damage spells. I can see how this would impact a wizard more than others, since they have little to do when they can't blast things. I'm not sure if this should be changed, but I'll bring it up. <br>
<br>
With the list below, a + means it's on the list, a – means that it is not on the list, and a ? means that I don't think I understand the problem and need more input. <br>
<br>
Specific Spells: <br>
<br>
+ Al'Kabor line of spells: The consensus is that this spell line is far less useful than the parallel line (pun!) of pillar spells. It seems that the benefit if a larger area of affect and a single extra target is not worthy of the increased mana cost. Frankly, it seems that there are no wizards casting this spell in Norrath. Heck if I know how to fix these. I'm against any call to simply remove the spell, that does little to actually help anything. Increasing its radius could be very messy. Adding more targets might be the best solution. <br>
<br>
+ Flaming Sword of Xuzl: Again, I'm against just eliminating what is already there (keep in mind that ideas like 'take away this spell and give us this one instead' don't really work well). Though I also agree with many of you that wizards shouldn't have pets. I do like the idea of allowing this thing to work sort of more like a DoT (as with the clerical hammer spell). Making it immune to spells and riposte might work to make this spell more useful. In any case, it should be looked at. <br>
<br>
+ Harvest: The feeling is that this spell doesn't 'ramp up' properly for levels over 50. Some want to see this spell recast faster, and I'll suggest it. But keep in mind that this is, essentially, increasing the wizards mana pool, which is an idea that I am against in general. <br>
<br>
+ Rain Spells: I agree that we should think about taking pets out of the equation. I'm not convinced that more needs to be done than that. We also might need to look at the resist rates on these spells (in conjunction with everything else). But I was thinking that we should consider increasing the over-all number of waves a bit (I mean, really, like by 1) but leaving pets in the formula. This would increase the relative power of wizards. But that also may not be the best thing to do (since there are people that play magicians too…). In general, this series should be looked at. <br>
<br>
- Okiel’s Radiation and the other one: Sure, not the greatest spells. But I can't imagine suggesting that they be made better. So let's just leave them as they are. <br>
<br>
+ Atol's Apectral Shackles: As a level 51 spell, it fizzles too much, reportedly more than Fetter a level 58 spell. I agree that we should review the whole thing with high fizzle rate spells. <br>
<br>
? Snare/Enstill: It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare… Tell me, would you rather have a group or a single target snare in that spell slot? <br>
<br>
+ Invisibility to Undead: I, honestly, don't know why wizards have this spell. I want to find out why. <br>
<br>
Teleport Spells: <br>
<br>
+ West Karana: Move this portal to the other side of the zone. This has all of the technical nightmares that I pointed out before (complete rebuilding of the zone and time to download it). But heck, it's on the list. <br>
<br>
+ Cazil Thule Gate: Mana of you think this is in too dangerous of a location. I'm not sure that there really should be any promise that the place you end up in should be safe. Use this spell when you know you're gonna die, and any destination is better than where you are. But I also see your point. <br>
<br>
+ Fade/shadowstep/yonder: These spells have problems going vertically. I'm not sure that this can be fixed, but if it can, it should be. <br>
<br>
+ Evacs: I agree that it would be nice if Evacs would take link-dead characters. I have no idea if this is possible, but I can certainly ask. <br>
<br>
+ Evacs and Abscond: I will check into the whole thing about these spells clearing or not clearing aggro lists. <br>
<br>
+ Abscond: This is another spell that fizzles too frequently. <br>
<br>
Items: <br>
<br>
- The Plane of Growth robe: Honestly, I'm fine with longer casting times on free direct damage spells. Even more so if it's a Lure. <br>
<br>
+ Epic Quest: I'll ask them to review the Cazic skin and the whole difficulty of this quest. But keep in mind that I am in favor of these quests being very hard. <br>
<br>
+ Concussion spell scroll: This is believed to be too hard to obtain. But, consider that this is a great spell, and having to earn it is a good thing to me. The question is, is it too hard to get. <br>
<br>
New Spell Ideas: <br>
<br>
&quot;BLINK (i.e. proc a defensive shadowstep) <br>
Ok, wizards know stuff and we travel. How about a defensive self-only &quot;Blink&quot; spell that predicts the future (of the combat we're in) and procs a shadowstep when the wizard's about to get hit? I'm not sayin it should work flawlessly, but that kind of spell seems to hit 2 of our supposed class-specific strengths (knowledge of the attack coming, and transportation away from the attack) and helps us be a bit less of a liability in groups. Maybe at high levels it could even have mild hate reduction a-la Concussion. Hell, gimme a whole blink line of defensive spells of varying proc frequency and effectiveness. <br>
This might also address the fact that we got no hp/ac and no pet to help with our defense.&quot; <br>
<br>
This is an interesting spell idea that I'll pass on. A 'buff' that basically procs shadowstep when the caster is hit. But only for potential future use, not for any sort of solution to current wizard issues. <br>
<br>
Wow. One day dedicated to two threads… And more to come tomorrow. <br>
<br>
Thanks for you input. I will certainly be reading this thread and updating my list. I may not post because I'll be posting in other threads. But I will keep reading.<br>

I just hope Verant actually DOES something rather than talk about it. <br>
<br>
Im especially glad to see the number one concern adressed properly, and that is mobs having way too many hps for a 1615 dd to do anything but make a scratch. <br>
<br>
I think the main problem with wizards that they have is that wizards are overpowered against some things, and underpowered against others. If they simply up our damage or manapool, they are making us too powerful against those lower hp mobs.<br>
<br>
I think that they are juggling the idea of making our DD do more damage on JUST those mobs with extremely high hit points. Seems like the idea is very young though.<br>
