<br>
Soze closed the heavy tome solidly, the sound echoing off the walls of the vast Library of Erudin. Still no answer, still no clue toward the fate of the older brother he lost so many years ago. As far as Soze knew, he had been abandoned as a child, and raised in the Hall of Truth in Freeport, and the foot of Valeron Dushire. The only father he ever knew ended up a traitor to his own knight’s code, a methodical killer whose ambition was only matched by his greed. It was only a few years ago that Valeron razed the Hall of Truth, before falling to Soze’s vengeful blade. The Hall stood once again, but was forever darkened by the betrayal of its original founder. <br>
<br>
And now, Soze had remnants – traces left of a true family he’d never known. His father died in a valiant battle against Lord Nagafen, his mother had passed soon after. His brother Kensor was barely more than a squire when he disappeared on his journey East. Surely Kane would not have brought a boy of 14 into Nagafen’s Lair – and there was nothing recovered from the dragon’s loot that had any tell tale marking beyond the false flask Soze had found originally. Soze had researched his parents’ name in Qeynos – Mi’shelle and Kane Soze were honored nobles, but following her husband and sons’ disappearance, Mi’shelle could bear the sight of Qeynos no longer. She had moved to a small tower in the Butcherblock Mountains to live out her days. She died not four years later, young still even by human standards. It was whispered in Qeynos that she died of a broken heart. <br>
<br>
The Guardians of the Crystal Rose had been his closest family since the collapse of the Legion of Dawn. They were a fine group of hearty adventurers, a boon to the face of Norrath. Just yesterday he sat in their grand hall, at a meeting ushered by Bonny Cheveyo, their wise and powerful leader. <br>
<br>
Bonny had sent a Guardian from each race to scour their cities and libraries for news or any sort of history of the missing brother. Salinye the high elven wizardess went home to Felwithe, while Dama gleaned the dark lore of Neriak. Kkan and Alhaman dug through the pages of troll and ogre knowledge, while Crimthann and Pardek searched through their home cities of Rivervale and Kaladim. Strath spoke with several barbarian shamans in Halas, while Zisken chatted with the eldest of gnomes in Ak’Anon. Chisi and Goldenpaww (a friend from the Blades of Light) examined the well-guarded secrets of the Iksar and the Vah Shir to no avail. Bonny’s trek to Kelethin reveled nothing. It was a grand but utterly fruitless gesture – no one had any insight or recollection into the life and likely death of Kensor, son of Baron Kane and Mi’shelle Soze. <br>
<br>
Threep the Enchanter had directed Soze to Erudin, where the vastest library in all of Norrath stood. Soze had spent hours combing through the grand tomes of knowledge, looking for any hint, any clue. The Erudites were a somewhat narcissistic and exacting race, but if anyone had record of Kensor’s disappearance it would be them. Their attention to detail was turning out to be more harmful than beneficial though, as book after book was filled with such minutiae that Soze felt he’d never see daylight again. <br>
<br>
After fourteen straight hours of research with no leads, the knight could resist no longer, and rested his head on his forearms. Knowing the Erudite guards would keep him and his possessions safe, he drifted into a deep slumber…sliding into the world of dreams….<br>
<br>
He wandered on a beach of white sand, watching the cloudless sky above as the soft waves rolled in over his feet. The misty breeze blew in over the water, kissing his face gently before running off into the hills. It as a beautiful day, the kind you wish you could bottle up and save for darker times. A crunch underfoot, stopped his carefree walk, and Soze knelt to investigate.<br>
<br>
Under his bare foot, he had stepped on a sand dollar, crushing it into the wet sand. A pity, he thought, to waste such a nice sea shell. He stood, and looked back to see how far he had come. His footsteps trailed back further than the eye could see. And yet he noticed something strange. Beside his footsteps lay the faint trail of another wanderer. Soze examined the sand, straining to recall what little bits of tracking sense he had retained from his many hunts alongside Geneva. <br>
<br>
The prints were partially blown away from the ocean breeze, but were not deep to begin with. It was certainly a human or humanlike race that left these bootprints, but the oddity wasn’t the size nor shape of the print – but the infrequency. There lay a good seven or eight feet between each offsetting step, meaning whatever had left this trail was obviously moving at an incredible speed. Was there danger? Why had this person been running so desperately fast, and why hadn’t Soze sensed any danger? The knight’s racing mind was halted by the sudden sound of a rattlesnake’s tail. <br>
<br>
Soze spun on his heel to the left, following the shaking sound. His right hand dropped to his waist, only to find no weapon there. He was unarmed, and perhaps worse – unarmored. His eyes locked on the sapphire source of the unexpected interruption.<br>
<br>
“Ach Soze, ye look like ye’ve seen a ghost.”<br>
<br>
The rattling tambourine should have been a dead giveaway. Therrin Tunetwister had bade the Guardians farewell before setting off on what he called “the grandest of adventures”. That was almost a year ago, and there had been no sign nor tale of him since. The silver-tongued minstrel left an impression on all his travels, so the silence of his exodus left many to fear that he had fallen. Soze lifted him from the sandy shore, giving him a bearhug that would have made Dethlefsen proud. <br>
<br>
“Therrin my friend! It is grand to see you again! We had feared the worst when no word came of your exploits…”<br>
<br>
“Soze, you know me better than that. I’m too fast,” he shook his imbued tambourine, “to be caught unaware…”<br>
<br>
“What brings you back Therrin? Will you stay?”<br>
<br>
“I cannot stay long, my duties are required elsewhere – but I am never too far away when a friend is in need – and you, my friend, are in need of some direction. And, lucky you – I know what happened to your brother, so long ago…”<br>
<br>
Soze was at a complete loss for words. The sight of one of his oldest friends long thought lost, and perhaps a desperately needed scrap of information regarding his recently discovered older brother.<br>
<br>
Therrin relayed the tale of the Teir’Dal assault on the Wynters caravan, of the valiant stand of Kensor, and of the dark enchantment of Mayong Mistmoore, that left the elder Soze trapped in the form of a marble statue. Mayong was once one of the most powerful elders in the Teir’Dal capitol of Neriak, but had built a grand castle in Faydwer, and become a hermit, then a legend, then a myth. His twisted castle stood to this day, haunted by the denizens of the night. Yet there had been no sign of Mayong’s presence in decades. <br>
<br>
Therrin smiled softly at his comrade. “Ye know I hated that dark Castle Mistmoore - Soze, and I wish I could go back with you. In our quests in and around that cursed castle we never saw any human statue, nor had any reason to be searching for one. I have heard songs and tales about the top of the castle, where Mayong once tortured innocents. It is there where your brother waits, captured in his marble prison.”<br>
<br>
The half-elven storyteller tilted his head at the overwhelmed knight.<br>
<br>
“I know this is a lot to take in, my friend, and I can offer no advice on how to reach the top of that accursed castle. I have faith that you will find the way in your quest. Take this,” he said, placing a small vial of swirling blue smoke into Soze’s hand.<br>
<br>
“This is a rare concoction called The Scent of Marr….release it underneath the nose of your brother’s statue and it will free him from his frozen state.” <br>
<br>
Therrin smiled at his old friend. Soze winced with the sudden realization that none of this could be true. <br>
<br>
“Therrin it’s so good to see you again – would that we could adventure together again, but in Norrath and not in an exhausted knight’s dream.”<br>
<br>
Therrin nodded in agreement. “Aye my friend – wish I could see you in Norrath as well, but my duty calls me elsewhere. When you wake from this dream, give my best to the Legionnaires and Guardians who remember me, and a special hello to my beloved Celowyn.”<br>
<br>
With a wink and a smile, Therrin pulled into a deep sapphire bow, straightening slowly and tapping the knight’s head with his tambourine…. <br>
<br>
<br>
Awake. Soze snapped upright, the hasty movement knocking the text from the table and to the floor of the library. The massive tome landed with a powerful thud, disturbing other readers and summoning a rude shushing from the Erudite librarian.<br>
<br>
The knight stretched his pinched shoulders, expanding his arms to either side and twisting his head to release the crick in his neck. He raised both hands to his face to wipe his eyes, only to feel a cold smoothness brush his cheek. Looking inside his closed right hand, he found a small vial filled with a dancing blue mist. <br>
<br>
And somewhere far away, a bard sped off into the night, smiling underneath the glow of the brilliant moon. <br>
