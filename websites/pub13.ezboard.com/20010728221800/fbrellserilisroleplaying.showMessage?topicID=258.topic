The explosion causing the avalanche had been a mighty one, seemingly as though the giants and the dragons had at long last reached a climax in their thousand year war, come together, and exploded as one great machine.  But Melba knew that was not what had happened.<br>
<br>
Melba had been exploring some of the remoter caves with her husband, Damdor.  It had been days since they’d seen anyone else, aside from the small camp of three dwarves who were tracking some sort of rabid bear.   They’d headed into the caves two days ago, and hadn’t returned as yet.   They’d also seen a group of Rangers go in, but that had been a week ago.  They’d said they were going “spelunking”.  (“More like ‘getting lost and dying’” Damdor grumbled.)<br>
<br>
The Lyteheart’s were running low on food.  Melba wanted to stay out, exploring the caves a bit more.   She didn’t mind so much, eating the terrible things she foraged.  They’d eaten worse.  At least here the dead things were quickfrozen, and didn’t rot, like in Kunark.<br>
<br>
Damdor mumbled something about a hot meal and some hot cider.    Melba sighed and stirred the embers of the fire.  <br>
<br>
“You go on back to town, hon.  I’ll be fine here.”<br>
<br>
Damdor watched his wife across the flickering fire.  “Alone??  I should go alone??  No.  No, you must come with me.”  She gave him a look.  He fidgeted.  “Are you sure you don’t want to come back with me?  A night in a warm bed, with room service, would do us both no end of good!” he grinned.<br>
<br>
She smiled fondly back at him.  “Aye, that’s what you’re wanting, isn’t it?  A nice warm, soft bed, and some huevos rancheros for brekkies….”<br>
<br>
He smiled and sipped his tea.  They’d used the last of the tealeaves, for this meal.  “And we need more tea.”<br>
<br>
Melba picked up the small canister they used to store their tea, and shook it.  Just crumbs.  She nodded.  “You go on, darling.  I’ll be fine!  I always am.   I’m going to track just a little way in, and then I’ll come back to camp and stay here.  Please don’t worry!  You’ll be back in two days, anyhow, won’t you.  It’s only a half days ride into town, I’m sure.  We’ve been going in circles, and we’re much closer than you think….”<br>
<br>
He nodded “True, darling, true.   And if I can’t have you to guide me, at least I have my trusty compass….”  He raised his eyebrows, grinned, and shook his rusty old compass at her.  He was funning her again.  She threw a tiny snowball at him, which bounced off the top of his knee.  Her stomach rumbled.<br>
<br>
“I heard that.    I’ll leave most of the fishrolls here with you, ok?  Ok, then.  I’m off.  I’ll be back before you know it!”  Damdor struggled to his feet, squelching in the muddy slush which made up the floor of their camp.  They’d found a small, secluded cavern, just off the entrance to the larger one they meant to explore.  Surely an old home for small bears, at one time.  No indication of anything living in there, recently, though.  Which worried Damdor, but didn’t seem to bother Melba.  The roof was slanted just right so that they could have a nice fire in the mornings and at night…and they had their bedrolls to keep them dry.  Home away from home.<br>
<br>
Damdor stepped around the fire, and held his hand out to his wife, who took it and rose from her cross-legged position on her folded-over bedroll.  She threw her arms around him and kissed him soundly.  “Bring me some of those little frosty dwarf cakes, will you?  The ones with the cream filling?”  She smiled and tweaked his chin.  He nodded, and looked down at her fingers, which were nimbly (for all it was so cold) fastening his armguards at his wrist.  “Don’t take your plate, darling, It’ll slow you down, and you’ll only freeze.”  He nodded again, looking at her fondly.  <br>
<br>
“Taking my helmet, though, ok mom?” he chided, putting it on.  She gave it two affectionate raps with her knuckle.   It rang hollowly.<br>
<br>
“Ok, buckethead,” she smiled.  “At least take some of these breadrolls, and the rest of this tea.<br>
<br>
“I’ll be fine…” he muttered.  “Rabbit jerky” he indicated his pack.   She wrinkled her nose.<br>
<br>
“Off you go, then!  Tunare guide you!” she called after him, as he picked his way down the ledge of the main cave, and off into the snow.  <br>
<br>
“Tunare my eye….” He grumbled to himself.  He stopped, however, and turned to look at her.  The day was just dawning, and for once it was clear, with no threat of snow.  The sun made Melba’s ivy green armor glow a warm purple.   She smiled and waved from the cave entrance, pushing her hair back out of her eyes in the slight breeze coming from the cave.  For some reason, Damdor turned fully to face her, and executed a jaunty warrior’s salute.  She laughed and blew him a kiss.  Then, she saluted back, ranger style.<br>
<br>
He trudged off into the snow, whistling a happy tune about killing Dark Elves at night in Kithicor.<br>
<br>
Grinning, Melba turned and went back into the little cave.  The fire had died almost completely.  There was plenty of kindling in the area, but she thought it would be a superb idea to find some actual timber to burn.  She and Damdor both thought that these caves had once been mined….perhaps there were mining shores down there, fallen from the walls or ceiling, that would burn nicely.   That was her plan for the day:  real firewood.<br>
<br>
She packed away the uneaten half of her breakfast muffin, and grabbed a small bag of dried fruit and a water flask.  She picked up her Wurmslayer…thought better of it and set it against the cavern wall.  Instead, she strapped her Short Ykesha to her beltloop.  She also grabbed up her staff.  She buffed herself up a bit with strength, agility, and good old Spirit of the Wolf, just in case she had to run from rabid bears or crazed spelunkers.  “Ranger, Ranger, run away!  Live to fight another day!” she sang, giggling at the old ditty she’d heard sung once, in a tavern frequented by Warriors.<br>
<br>
She kicked her bedroll into the corner with Damdor’s, away from the dwindling fire.  She strapped her pack onto her back, and ducked under the small cave’s entrance, heading left and down into the entrance of the main cavern.  The persistent dripping of water off the stalactites reminded Melba that Spring was nigh, and soon, given some sunlight and encouragement, maybe even this bleak land would turn green and bloom.  At least, she hoped so.  They’d seen so much snow, lately….<br>
<br>
Melba marked her pathway down the cavern with a piece of coal.  She made the sign of Tunare every time she took a turn down into another tunnel.  So far, no tracks indicating mining cars…but that didn’t mean anything.  “This may not even be the principal entrance” she thought.<br>
<br>
She was about a mile into the cavern, traveling quickly, finding nothing, when she felt a slight rocking.  Dust puffed down from the tunnel’s ceiling, and a few pebbles skittered down the sloping path, rolling into darkness.  <br>
<br>
That was odd, she thought.   There’s been no indication of volcanic activity in this area.  Maybe an earthquake?<br>
<br>
She continued on.<br>
<br>
And on.<br>
<br>
An hour later, having found nothing, Melba decided to head back.  Tomorrow, she would go down the other branching tunnel.  These caverns couldn’t be completely empty.  Could they?<br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes into her ascent, she saw a glowing light ahead of her.  Company!  She thought, brightly.  And yet, ever cautious, she unsheathed her Ykesha, stepped back into the shadows and hid herself until she could be sure.  Strangely, nothing showed on her tracking.  She crept along the side of the cave, towards the increasing glow.  It was blueish, with a green tint.  She could make out a form, now.  Was it a person?  A person on fire??  <br>
<br>
“Show yourself!”  she called.  And, as an afterthought, cried “I am armed!”<br>
<br>
The light pulsed once and dimmed.  “No need for that, child.” A voice said, with a slight laugh.  “Put it away, or you’ll hurt yourself in the dark, silly ranger!”<br>
<br>
Irked, Melba stepped a bit closer to the dimming light.  That voice.  She knew that voice.  She’d heard it once, in her dreams, long ago.<br>
<br>
Melba took another tentative step towards the light.  And another.  The glowing thing advanced on her a bit, until the form solidified.  She dropped her sword with a dull thud onto the cavern floor.<br>
<br>
“Tunare??”<br>
<br>
“Aye, child, it’s me.  There’s no time to talk.  Get your sword, and go.  Run.  Back up the way you came.  Follow the marks you made, clever girl. But get out of here, now!”<br>
<br>
“But….”<br>
<br>
The glowing lady held out her hand.  “No buts.  Go.  Now.  If you value your life, go!  I can do nothing to stop what’s to happen, but at least I can warn you.”  She faded a bit more.  “It’s a direct order, child.  Take heed.”    Tunare disappeared.<br>
<br>
Melba, eyes still huge and brimming with tears at the wonder of Tunare, leaned down quickly, grabbed her Ykesha, and ran.   Miles to go, still, it seemed.  There was another jolt, and it caused her to stagger and grab uselessly for the cavern wall.  Her Spirit of the Wolf spell wore off.  “Damn” she swore quietly, and hurriedly re-cast.   “Damn!” she said as it took, and she took off running again, just as another jolt, larger this time, shook the cavern.  Finally, finally she could see the glare of the clean white snow of the cavern entrance.  With another burst of speed, she was up the ramp and almost to the cave mouth when a bigger jolt than any of the others hit.  Before her eyes, a wall of snow appeared and the cavern mouth closed, for all of Norrath as if she was being swallowed up by a giant monster made of ice and stone.<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
Two days later, Damdor returned to the spot where he had left his wife.  The cave was gone, somehow.  He knew, though, that he was in the right place.  Sticking out at an angle, 6 feet up the wall of snow, was Melba’s Wurmslayer.   He swore furiously and began to dig.<br>

<br>
She’d been knocked flat backwards by the force of the cave-in, and her head had hit the floor hard enough to knock her out…but for how long??  How long had she been unconscious?  All her buffs were gone, so it had been at least 20 minutes.  The air in the dark cavern was still and black; not a glimmer of light anywhere. Just the ever-present dripping, and the settling of rocks.<br>
<br>
Melba wondered why Tunare hadn’t warned her sooner about the avalanche/explosion/ whatever it was.  Why the glowing and the fussing and the laughing?  Surely she’d known Melba would never make it out of the cavern in time!  Or were the gods fallible, too?  Something to ponder…but at another time, surely.<br>
<br>
Melba tentatively got to her feet, and, breathing hard through her nose to get the dust and snow out, she checked to make sure nothing was broken.  Her head had a huge bump, but other than that, nothing screamed at her.  That was a blessing.  <br>
<br>
She timidly cast a light heal spell on her bumped head, which relieved the pounding, at any rate.  And brightened the cavern enough to show her that, while the front entrance was gone, the rest of the tunnel was pretty intact.  Lots of boulders everywhere, and the snow drift....but the dust had settled.<br>
<br>
She summoned a lightstone, cast eyes of the cat on herself, and searched her immediate area.  Her staff was on the floor, close to where she'd woken up.  She bent down to pick it up and heard a scrambling noise.  More boulders?  An aftershock?  She braced herself, standing still, looking around.  <br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello?&quot; she called out, almost whispering for fear of disturbing the silence.<br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
Then, a giggle.  Very small, very quiet...and she wasn't at all sure which direction it was coming from.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello!  Hello there!  Who's here?&quot;  she cried.  <br>
<br>
Silence answered her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have it your way....&quot;  Irritated, she picked up her bag which had tumbled intact to the floor, hefted it to her shoulders, and said &quot;I'm off to find a way out of here!  If you care to show yourself, please do so at your leisure.&quot;  And, taking the other route from the one she had taken that morning, she gingerly set off down the trail, taking care to mark her passage with coal.<br>
<br>
Behind her, silently, something followed.  Erasing the coal marks of Tunare that Melba was leaving on the walls at her every turn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umelbatoast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melbatoast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/3/01 4:59:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Wood Elves</span><hr size=1> Melba continued following the twisting tunnel down inside the mountain range.  It was never very steep, but it switched back and forth quite a bit, and sometimes even seemed to go up.  At one point, Melba’s head started aching again.  She sat against the cavern wall and had some dried fruit and a bit of water, and rested.  Her mana rejuvenated (she’d been casting buffs like crazy, to keep her strength and stamina up), she did a full healing on her poor head.  Thus refreshed, she trudged on.<br>
<br>
From time to time, she heard the scrambling behind her.  But when she’d try to track it, nothing was there.  No footprints, no smell, no sound.    Nevertheless, she kept her Ykesha slightly un-hooked from her belt, ready.<br>
<br>
The tunnel had been going up for some time when she heard a noise ahead of her.  No giggling, no scrambling, but a real noise.  Rocks being moved.  Heavy rocks.<br>
<br>
“Hullo there!” she called, skirting around a pile of silt that had collected from a recent overhead cave-in.<br>
<br>
“Shhhhh!!” she was shushed.  “Please!  You’ll start another one with all that carrying on!!”<br>
<br>
“  “ she replied (rangers do know when to shush).  But she didn’t think she’d been carrying on, just saying “Hullo there”.  She headed towards the voice, and soon came upon a wood elf, or rather, half of a wood elf, sticking out of the side of the cavern wall.<br>
<br>
“Oh, blessed mother of us all!” she cried, in a whisper, and dropped her pack on the ground.  She ran to him and began to whisk the pebbles away from his face, as they fell in trickles from the top of the hole from which he was emerging.  “Here, let me help….”<br>
<br>
“Yes, do.  Please grab my arms and pull.  You haven’t any troll oil, have you??” he looked at her beseechingly.<br>
<br>
“Troll oil?  No.  Sorry.  No.  Nor a barbarian who could shrink you!” she smiled.   He grimaced.  “Sorry….” She said, and took a firm grip on his forearms.  With her foot leveraged against the downslope of the cavern wall, she yanked.  And yanked some more.  By little bits, he moved.  Then, just as she was despairing that he’d lodged himself against some boulder, he popped through.  They both went flying across the cavern, while a cold wind blew through the little hole.  She picked herself up off the floor. <br>
<br>
“Are you ok??” she asked him.<br>
<br>
“Fine, now,” he grinned from the pile of silt he was lying on.  “Thanks!  Ranger, yes?   Me too.  I think we saw each other, a week or so ago…at the entrance.  The spelunkers?”  He extended a hand.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, yes, that was you?”  she nodded, shaking his outstretched hand.  “How goes the spelunking?  Or, better yet, here’s another question.  Did you hear the explosion?  And do you know we’re trapped in here?  And do you know a way out?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t know myself, as I’m more the excavation/hole man, but they might….” He said, pointing at the hole he’d just been forcibly ejected from.  She walked over and peered down, and was surprised to see two sets of eyes blinking at her.  “Hullo, there, spelunkers!” she called quietly through the hole.  “Coming through?<br>
<br>
There was discussion and more discussion, and eventually a sort of shovel was passed through the hole.  The spelunker she had pulled through took it and began, very carefully, to widen the hole.  “OK, fellahs, I think you’re good.  Give it a try….”<br>
<br>
One by one, the band of wood elf rangers squeezed through the hole, and stood brushing themselves off, eyeing Melba.<br>
<br>
“What’s this about an explosion?” one of them asked.<br>
<br>
Melba explained about her adventure, about seeing Tunare (at which they were appropriately impressed, aghast, and at the same time, suspicious), about her run to the entrance, and then the avalanche.  <br>
<br>
“An avalanche?  Not an explosion?” the one who had spoken before asked.<br>
<br>
“Well, it sounded like an explosion, but it could’ve been rocks falling, now that I think of it.  Or snow.  I don’t know.  Do avalanches sound like an explosion??” she asked.  The wood elves shrugged.  They were only here on an explorer’s holiday, and to tell the truth, weren’t too happy with all the snow.<br>
<br>
Then she told them about the scrabbling and the giggling.  They peered behind them, down the tunnel where Melba had emerged.  They had no ideas.  “Could be anything, really” one of them muttered.<br>
<br>
“Tea?” one of them asked, suddenly.  Melba was astonished by their casual attitude about being trapped forever in a cold, dark cavern.   But still, she shared their tea, and even passed around some dried pears (“Delightful!” one of them cried).<br>
<br>
Just then, another boom and a thud shook the cavern.  “Oh, THAT!” one of the rangers said.  “That’s been going on for days!  You’ve only just felt it?”<br>
<br>
Melba looked at him.<br>
<br>
“Spring thaw, my dear.  Spring thaw,” he wiped a drop of tea from his lower lip.  He looked at her in a side glance, “Err,  Melba, dear, what’s your dragon faction??  Do you know?”<br>
<br>
She set her teacup down on the saucer (these wood elves….).  “Well,” she said, swallowing, “I think it’s ok!  I mean, I’ve never fought one, and I’ve always rather admired them.  So, really, I think it should be ok!  Why?”  She looked around nervously.<br>
<br>
“Ah, no reason.  If it’s good, then that’s all that matters.  Look, we’re staying in, or rather, going on with our travels,  because we know the other entrance to this place…and it’s YONKS from here.  And tiny holes…you’d have to….but no!  You’d never make it with us, though, being human .  I mean, my dear, you’re no Barbarian, but look at you!  So tall! That bosom! tsk.  No, no, we’ll have to show you the other way out…..”<br>
<br>
At that, the woodelves drained their teacups, packed them away, and with much joviality and jostling, they stood before her, ready to push on.<br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umelbatoast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melbatoast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/4/01 1:39:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Wood Elves?</span><hr size=1> Melba couldn’t decide if the wood elves were to be trusted.  Sure, they were friendly, and shared their tea, but something in their manner…they didn’t seem all that worried about the explosions resounding through the caverns.  She decided she really had very little choice but to follow them, however.  If they knew a way out, they knew a way out!<br>
<br>
Off they all marched, down the corridor…or rather up, as the path in this section was still veering upwards.<br>
<br>
“What was in that other cavern?” Melba asked the one she had pulled through.<br>
<br>
“Oh, just the old mines...” he answered.<br>
<br>
Melba lifted her arms.  “Figures.  I’ve been looking for those all day!”<br>
<br>
“There’s not much in them.  And besides, you can’t get to them from your entrance…well, you can NOW, what with the hole.  We had to walk all the way to the other entrance, and then back down through a separate, hidden tunnel, to get to the mines.” He explained.<br>
<br>
They trudged on in silence for a bit.<br>
<br>
“What are you and that warrior doing down here, anyway?  I mean, there’s nothing to hunt.  And you’re NOT spelunkers….” He glanced at her.<br>
<br>
“No, not spelunking,” she grinned.  “Mostly just exploring.  Killing palls after awhile, you know?  We thought we’d see more of Velious, before it became the tourist trap that Kunark has become.”<br>
<br>
The wood elf nodded in agreement.  “Aye.  One of the reasons we’re here is to get away from the overcrowding in Greater Faydark.  You wouldn’t believe how bad it’s gotten there.  And so many beggars!  You can’t just enjoy your day, like you used to.  Always someone asking for a handout….” He shook his head.<br>
<br>
The strode on in companionable silence for a ways.   At a crossroads in the passageway, the wood elf in the lead called a halt, and they all stopped.  “This” he said imperiously “is it.”  He pointed down the path, into the dark tunnel.<br>
<br>
“It’s going down” she said.<br>
<br>
He nodded, putting his thumbs through his leiderhosen straps.  Had he been wearing those before? she wondered.    “Aye, you must go down into the deepest part of the caverns, before it leads you to a steep path that takes you up.  It’ll put you out about ½ mile from where you entered, I reckon.”<br>
<br>
“He reckons?” she thought.  “Sounds like a halfling….”<br>
<br>
“Er…ok, then,” she said aloud.  “Thanks much for your assistance!  And good luck!  But please, do rethink leaving.  I really do think that something bad is about to happen in this cavern, and it’d be safer for everyone if we all got out!”<br>
<br>
One of them nodded, one of them shuffled his feet, the other cleared his throat to say something, but thought better of it.  The last one…the leader, smiled a bit, then let out a strange little giggle.<br>
<br>
“We’ll be fine, milady.  You just take care.  You’ll be out of here before you know it.”<br>
<br>
They all bowed to her simultaneously, and headed up the path that was still winding upwards.<br>
<br>
Melba looked down the dark path, considered it for a moment, and then moved into the darkness.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Back at the cave entrance, Damdor was still digging.  The Wurmslayer had turned out be a red herring.  It must’ve been flung from the cavern by some sort of force, for as much as he dug, he couldn’t find any indication that there had ever been a cavern entrance here.<br>
<br>
He had no idea how long ago the cave in happened, but by the looks of the snowpack, it was shortly after he’d left her.   He had to keep digging.  There was nothing else he could do.  He couldn’t just leave her there.  Not if there was a chance….<br>

Even her lightstone and eyes of cat spell couldn’t penetrate farther than 15 feet in front of her.  That made her very nervous.  Still, nothing on her track.  But that didn’t mean anything.  Perhaps the bump on her head had disrupted her tracking abilities.<br>
<br>
Hours later, the path leveled out a bit.  She noticed that the dark was decreasing, she could see further into the tunnel.  Soon, a strange glow loomed ahead of her.  The glow got brighter, and eventually she came to a large, domed cavern, bisected by a stream.  The stream had that strange glow, like the one leading to Thurgadin..  Lying next to the stream was a mummified Shardwurm.  <br>
<br>
“Now, how on Norrath did that thing get in here?” she wondered.<br>
<br>
She surveyed the cavern, finding a likely spot to get some rest.  It had been a long day…and she wasn’t sure what time it was.  She just knew that she was exhausted.  She dropped her backpack on the ground and lay down,  head resting on her pack, regretting not having her bedroll.   The jolts had decreased, over the hours of her solitary walk, and there hadn’t been on in the last couple of hours.<br>
<br>
She pondered the high domed ceiling of the cavern, admiring the play of light from the stream on the stalactites.   She said a quiet prayer to Tunare, asking her to keep her safe while she slept, and to not let Damdor worry too much about her.<br>
 <br>
She was just drifting off when she heard a voice.  A quiet, whisper of a voice.  It was coming from this side of  the stream, to her left, but behind a large boulder.  Quietly, she rose to her feet and, hugging the cavern wall, tiptoed  along the wall.  Peeking around the boulder, she saw a girl.<br>
<br>
The girl was on her side, curled up in an almost fetal position, rocking slightly.  But then Melba noticed that one of her legs was sticking out at a strange angle.  The girl was humming.  Or was she praying?  Melba couldn’t tell.   She stayed still against the boulder, thinking of a way to announce her presence without startling the girl.  It was too late.  She saw the girl tense up, and try to turn herself over.<br>
<br>
“No, no, no, please.  Don’t hurt me!” she whispered, her voice full of tears and pain.  Melba dashed from behind the rock and kneeled in front of the girl.  She saw she was a high elf, very pretty, very young.  But shabbily dressed, which was unusual, for a high elf.<br>
<br>
“Oh, no, of course I won’t!  Let me help you!”  Melba was about to cast healing on the girl, when she suddenly grabbed her hands.<br>
<br>
“No!  No spells!”  She seemed terrified.<br>
<br>
“What?  Why ever not?  You need to be healed!” Melba whispered back.  Alarmed by the girl’s refusal of healing, she glanced around, expecting something to be coming at them.<br>
<br>
The girl took in a rasping sob of a breath, and said “It’ll attract them.  We don’t want to attract them!!”  The girl was obviously delirious with pain.<br>
<br>
Melba looked at the girl, and considered the situation.<br>
<br>
“Ok, no spells.  But at least let me make you more comfortable.  I need to put your leg bone back in line. It’ll heal on it’s own, naturally, with time, but only if we can straighten it.”  The girl looked at her with lovely green, almond shaped eyes.  Her eyes were calm, which was in direct opposition to the tone of her voice.<br>
<br>
“Will it hurt?” she asked tremulously.<br>
<br>
“Yes” Melba couldn’t lie to her.  “But I’ve got a flask full of brandy.  That may help dull the pain a bit.”<br>
<br>
The girl nodded. And tried to right herself.  Melba stood and, putting her arms under the girl’s arms from behind her, dragged her away from the stream and towards a small indented area in the wall.  She propped the girl up there, and ran back for her pack behind the boulder.  She rummaged through the bag, and handed her the flask.  “Take a good swallow, ok?”  The girl nodded and did so, shuddering.<br>
<br>
“Good, ok.  Here, grab onto my staff and squeeze it with both hands, tightly.  It’ll help with the pain.&quot;  She hoped.  “My mother gave me that staff, before I left home for my first ever ranger job” she said, talking to divert the girl’s attention away from what she was about to do.  “It’s very precious to me.  I’m sure the love she put into it will help you with the pain.  Squeeze hard!” she said.<br>
<br>
She grabbed the girl’s boot, and when the girl opened her mouth to say something, she yanked the leg toward herself, and twisted it to the right.  There was a crack, then another, then a pop.  The girl screamed, and kept screaming.  Melba made sure the leg was aligned, and shuffled around to the girl’s head.  She grabbed the flask and poured a bit into the girl’s mouth.   Before closing the flask, Melba took a sip.  The brandy burned her throat, but she felt her insides go warm.<br>
<br>
The girl was whimpering now, wringing the staff with her hands.  Melba stroked her hair and let her cry.<br>
<br>
“Better?”  Melba asked after a long while.<br>
<br>
“A little,” the girl whispered through clenched teeth.<br>
<br>
“You were very brave,&quot; she said, smiling.  &quot;My name’s Melba Lyteheart.  I’m a Ranger, guided by the blessing and love of Tunare.  What’s your name?”<br>
<br>
“F…Firiona,” the girl replied.  Melba raised her eyebrows.  The girl smiled weakly.  “No.  Not that Firiona.  Mother just named me after her.  She admired her….spirit….”<br>
<br>
Melba smiled and nodded.  The girl panted a bit, fighting a wave of nausea and pain, and then coughed.  But she’d stopped crying.<br>
<br>
“Now, can you tell me what you’re doing here??” Melba asked.<br>
<br>
“I was….trying to find…the mines.”<br>
<br>
“Is there a treasure or something?”<br>
<br>
She shook her head slightly.  “No.  Pilgrimage.  Holy relics are thought to be…..lost in them.  But I’ve failed.  I’ve been down here for weeks!”<br>
<br>
Weeks!  Melba couldn’t imagine it.  Where was her stuff?  Why was her leg broken?<br>
<br>
As if hearing her unasked question, the girl pointed up towards the ceiling.  “That last large shaking….I was exploring a small tunnel, and the floor collapsed, and I ended up here.”<br>
<br>
That was quite a long fall.  Melba was astonished the girl wasn’t dead.  <br>
<br>
They sat in silence for awhile, and the girl finally drifted off to sleep.  Melba gently removed the girl’s head from her lap, and scooted sideways.   She took a small leather tunic out of her pack, folded it up, and put it under Firiona’s head.  She stood with her hands on her hips, looking around the cavern for something to make a splint with.  No wood, as usual, she frowned.  Wurm bones?  She grimaced at the thought of carving up that beast.  Besides, Wurm bones were porous and would probably break easily.  She needed something really straight, really hard, and …. She looked at her staff, lying on the ground next to Firiona’s open hand.  She knew it was the only solution.<br>
<br>
She grabbed her Ykesha from the pile of her belongings she’s discarded when she popped the High Elf’s leg back in place.  “Shame to use the blade to hack a piece of wood” she thought “but oh well.”  She placed the blade’s tip in a central spot at the top of the staff and tapped it gently with her boot.  And again, until it was wedged firmly into the staff.  Then she began to move the blade back and forth until she heard a cracking.  The staff split neatly in half.  She used the blade to saw the staff in half again.  Her Ykesha was now useless for a fight, but perhaps it would still process.  That was something, at least.  She tied the two flat surfaces of the bottom half of the staff to Firona’s leg with strips of leather from her undertunic.  Firiona stirred once, whimpering quietly, and slept again.  The splint in place, Melba collapsed onto the ground next to the girl, and slept for hours.<br>

***************<br>
<br>
<br>
When she woke, she found Firiona sitting up, admiring her splinted leg.  The girl smiled at her and said “Good morning!  Or, good evening.  Who knows for sure….”<br>
<br>
“Glad to see you sitting up!  Are you feeling better?”  Melba asked, sitting up, herself.  She reached for her backpack and began to rummage through it.<br>
<br>
“Yes, a lot.  Thanks.  It still hurts, but not so much.  I had some more brandy…” she said sheepishly, handing Melba the flask.  Melba shook it…half empty.  She grinned at the girl.  “Not too drunk to try to find our way out of here, are you?”<br>
<br>
Firiona smiled and said “It takes a lot more than a shot of brandy to get me drunk, my lady.”  Melba didn’t pause to consider how a High Elf so young could have such a high Alcohol Tolerance.  She’d found her bag of fishrolls, and passed one to Firiona.  <br>
<br>
“I’m afraid they may be a bit stale, but the fish is smoked, and should be ok.”  She stood.  “I wonder if we can drink this stream water?”<br>
<br>
Firiona shook her head.  “I wouldn’t.” <br>
<br>
“You’re most likely right….” Melba answered.  “Ah well, we should be out of here, soon enough.  There’s plenty of water, outside!  And the faster we get out of here the better, now that we’re weaponless.…”  <br>
<br>
“We have no weapons?”  the girl looked up at her questioningly.<br>
<br>
“Nope.  I used the staff to splint your leg, and my sword to chop the staff.  I can have it sharpened, of course, but….”<br>
<br>
“You chopped up your staff, for me?  You ruined your lovely sword, for me?” She stared in amazement at Melba.  <br>
<br>
“Well, of course!  Anyone would have.”<br>
<br>
Firiona shook her head.  “Actually, that’s not true….” She said.  “Followers of Bristlebane, for instance, wouldn’t do it.  In fact, they wouldn’t think twice about misleading a wandering ranger….”  Firiona was muttering now, staring at her splint, looking around the cavern.<br>
<br>
“Melba, what are you doing in these caverns??” Firiona asked, suddenly.<br>
<br>
Melba told her the tale of how she and her husband Damdor had come here to explore, how she had gotten trapped in the cave, and how she had reached this cavern, in time to help the injured Firiona.  She told her about seeing Tunare (Firiona frowned slightly, at that), and the group of wood elf rangers (at which Firiona nodded, almost sullenly).  She told her about the giggling and the scrambling and the jolts.  Firiona frowned, and continued to frown, and continued to look around the cavern, listening for something, it seemed….<br>
<br>
“What’s wrong?” Melba asked, disturbed.   “Do you hear something?  And what’s all that you were saying about Bristlebane?”<br>
<br>
Firiona turned her gaze on Melba once more.  She took a deep breath.  “Lady Ranger, I’m afraid I’ve been dishonest with you.  I can’t say I’m ashamed…it was necessary, though, as you could very well have been sent here to disrupt my task.”<br>
<br>
Melba boggled.  “Disrupt your task?  Finding the relics?”<br>
<br>
Firiona shifted her weight and tried to bend her leg a little.  She rearranged the splint a little bit, and was able to bend her knee a fraction of an inch.  She looked up at Melba, who was standing above her, hands on hips.<br>
<br>
“I’m not here on a pilgrimage.  I’m here to save lives.”<br>
<br>
Melba raised her eyebrows and continued to listen.<br>
<br>
Firiona looked at the ground and took a breath.  “I was sent here by….well, you don’t need to know that.  I was asked to come here to search for a dragon.”<br>
<br>
Melba was quiet a moment. Frowning, she asked “To kill it?”<br>
<br>
“Oh no no!!  Not that.  Not ever that.  The dragon is one of the lives I’m to save.”<br>
<br>
“From whom??”<br>
<br>
Firiona sighed.  “To cut a really long and potentially tedious story short, from Bristlebane.  He kidnapped a dragon who we believe to be Veeshan…” Melba gasped.  “Yes, it’s too horrid to think about, but it’s true…” Firiona continued.   “He’s holding her captive.  We think, here.”<br>
<br>
“Who’s this ‘we’, Firiona?” Melba asked.<br>
<br>
The High Elf looked up at Melba and said “Regretfully, I can’t tell you that, right now.” <br>
<br>
“I’ll accept that, for now.”<br>
<br>
Firiona smiled.  “I was sure you would!  Now, can you help me?  There’s isn’t much time left.  The dragon…she’s the one causing all these earthquakes and explosions and avalanches.  Fizzlethorpe, the wily old bastard, trapped her in a cavern like this one, only a bit larger.  He thinks that one of her many children, long ago, hid some fabulous treasure here in these caverns.  Which is absolute nonsense, but Bristlebane doesn’t know that.  He’s such a fool!” she spat.  This girl does not seem to be the same meek, injured elf I found yesterday, Melba thought to herself.  “He’s trapped her and won’t let her out until she tells him where the treasure is.”  She pounded the ground with her fists, sending up little clouds of dust.  She stared up at the ceiling for a moment, wiped her hands together to get the dust off, and took a deep breath.  <br>
<br>
Firiona, recomposed, looked up at Melba, and smiled.  “Veeshan is trapped in a cavern, and is destroying it.  She’ll destroy this entire mountain range, to get out of here.  There’s a City on the other side of this range, you know.  She’ll destroy the city, once she’s destroyed the range.  She’ll kill countless numbers of people, if we don’t free her.”<br>
<br>
“The elves…the dwarves….” Melba began.<br>
<br>
“Yes, the group of dwarves and elves you saw….they’re all dead.  Trapped under rocks.  We can’t help them.  But we can help ourselves, and Veeshan.”<br>
<br>
“But, how do you know the elves are dead?  I just saw them yesterday! They lead me here!”<br>
<br>
Firiona shook her head.  “They weren’t rangers.  They were Bristlebane.”<br>
<br>
Melba opened her mouth for a moment, and shut it again.  Then said “What, all of them?”<br>
<br>
Firiona nodded.  Melba looked at the ceiling.  “That little bastard trickster…” she muttered.<br>
<br>
Firiona nodded again.  “You see how he works.  He led you down here…saying it was an exit…when really, it was just taking you deeper into danger, and closer to the dragon.  Who WILL kill you, if she doesn’t know any better.”<br>
<br>
Melba picked at the piece of dried pear in her hands.  How was she supposed to absorb all of this?  What was she supposed to say to this poor injured High Elf girl who seemed to know so much about the gods, and about dragons.<br>
<br>
“You….how do you know all this?  Why you??”<br>
<br>
“I can’t tell you that right now.  I wish I could.  I will later.  But now, we’ve GOT to get going….”<br>
<br>
“But…your leg?”<br>
<br>
“Oh.” said Firiona, looking down at her splinted limb.  “That’ll heal.  Just DON’T cast any spells on me, ok?  Promise, Melba?  Now, help me up….”  The girl started to pull herself up, using the wall to steady her leg.  Melba stood and grabbed her arm to steady her other side.  Firiona stood, tested her leg, and grimaced.  <br>
<br>
“It’ll hurt for a long, long while.  Why don’t we just find our way out of here, and send someone back?”<br>
<br>
Firiona shook her head.  “I’ll be fine.  I just need a little time.  But I can’t leave Veeshan here.  It’s imperative that we get to her.”  Melba looked at the girl, saw the determination and compassion in her eyes, and nodded. <br>
<br>
“How can I not help?” Melba asked her, smiling.  Firiona smiled back.<br>
<br>
“Good!  Let’s get going, then….”<br>
<br>
To Melba’s surprise, the girl began to hop on her good leg.   Then, tentatively, she put a little of her weight on her broken one…then more, and did a little hop/walk.  Then she was walking, suddenly, with a limp, but still walking.  “See?” she smiled at Melba.  “Not so bad at all!  High Elves heal fast…” she added, as an afterthought.<br>
<br>
“I guess so….” Melba said, uncertainly.  She picked her pack and sword and remaining staff pieces up off the ground, and followed slowly along after Firiona, anticipating that the girl would eventually fall and break her other leg.  She never did fall.<br>

******<br>
<br>
Firiona’s leg seemed to heal itself, the more she walked on it.  The High Elf lead them across the stream, past the long-dead Wurm (“Poor thing…a child of Veeshan, no doubt…” Firiona whispered), and through another entrance to the cavern.  They continued down the tunnel.<br>
<br>
“Why have the explosions stopped?” Melba asked.<br>
<br>
“Either she’s asleep, she’s escaped (one can only hope), or she’s dead.” Firiona answered, ominously.<br>
<br>
As if in answer to Melba’s query, they heard a loud crash and the ground jumped under their feet.  Melba grabbed at Firiona’s arm to hold her up, but the High Elf had steadied herself and was listening.<br>
<br>
“That way,” she pointed to a branch in the tunnel that was heading, miraculously, up.  They quickened their pace as much as they could, and headed up.<br>
<br>
The ground began to shake violently, in five minute intervals.  “We’re getting closer,” Firiona whispered.  “No spells, now…you’ll only frighten her.  Or anger her.”  Melba nodded.<br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes later, they came to a door.  A large, wooden, bolted door.  They looked at each other.  “What now?” Melba asked.<br>
<br>
“I don’t suppose you can pick locks…” Firiona said.<br>
<br>
“Errrm, no, ‘fraid not….”  Melba looked around the door.  The hinges were rusted to the doorframe.  The lock looked very old, and a bit rusty.  “How about this?”  Melba unhooked her damaged Ykesha from her belt.  “It’s already needing repair.  A little more won’t hurt….”<br>
<br>
She timed it so that her Ykesha striking the lock coincided with the explosions.   They had to wait agonizing minutes for the next one, but on the third try, the poor trusty damaged sword managed to break the lock.  “The old fashioned way,” Melba said.<br>
<br>
“Thank the gods it didn’t process!” Firiona muttered.<br>
<br>
“Hardly ever does…” Melba grinned at her.<br>
<br>
“Ok, quiet now…..” Firiona put her hand in the doorhandle and gently pulled.  There was only a rust scraping noise, but it was soft.  She peaked in…and pulled the door open a bit more.  All was darkness.   They could see nothing, but Melba couldn’t cast her sight spell. They could tell, by the resonance of sound, that the chamber was a big one.  Firiona rummaged in her dusty leather tunic pants and pulled out a small candle and a flint.  “Always come prepared, when magic may fail you…” she said.  She lit the candle, holding it gingerly between two fingers.  She peered into the darkness.<br>
<br>
Something was coming at them…something large, and red, was coming towards the door, at a speed greater almost than their eyes could follow it.<br>
<br>
“Back!” Firiona shouted.  Too late.   She and Melba were thrown by the force of wind and dust across the cavern and into the wall.  The flickering candle was lying on the ground, but Melba could still see what was at the door.  A large, red dragon tail, twitching.  Scales battered and dusty.  <br>
<br>
Firiona jumped to her feet as quickly as she could, hopping on her good leg.  She scooped up the candle and headed towards the door.  “We’ve got to stop her.  She’s hurting herself.”<br>
<br>
The High Elf went straight for the tail, and pushed on it.  At first, it didn’t move.  She pushed again, and again.  The tail twitched and slithered past the door.  In moments, it was replaced by the flaring nostrils of a dragon’s snout.  The dragon took a deep breath.<br>
<br>
“Veeshan, no!”  Firiona cried.<br>
<br>
“And why shouldn’t I, jailer!” the dragon rumbled at her.<br>
<br>
“I am not your jailer, Veeshan.  Bristlebane is the one who keeps you trapped here.  We are here to free you!”<br>
<br>
A great golden eye appeared at the door, tilting up and down to get a look.<br>
<br>
The dragon exhaled.  “Tunare??!!” <br>
<br>
Firiona smiled at the dragon.  “Yes, my dear old lady.  It’s Tunare.”<br>
<br>
Melba gasped and took a step backwards.  “But…You look nothing like the Tunare I saw in the cavern, the other day.”<br>
<br>
Firiona/Tunare motioned Melba to be still and quiet.  “Veeshan, dear, will you move back a bit so we can get in there with you?”  The dragon obliged.    Firiona/Tunare stepped through the door, Melba cautiously moving in behind her.<br>
<br>
“Veeshan, all this pounding you’re doing is destroying this mountain range!  Killing innocent people!”<br>
<br>
“There are no innocent people,” the dragon growled at the goddess.  “All are evil.  All should perish!”<br>
<br>
“Now, Veeshan, you know you don’t feel that way.  Look, I have a human here with me.  Is she a threat to you??”<br>
<br>
Veeshan peered down at Melba.  She lowered her massive head and put her mouth right in front of Melba’s head.  Melba was quaking inside, but stood her ground.  Veeshan’s massive tongue rolled out of her mouth, and she gave Melba a bit of a lick on the top of her head.    Veeshan reared back on her haunches.<br>
<br>
“No.  She has good faction with the Children of the Wurmqueen.  I will not eat her.”  Melba exhaled, unaware that she had been holding her breath.<br>
<br>
Tunare smiled at Melba.  For Melba realized that indeed she HAD to be the goddess, if she spoke thus with dragons, and came to no harm.<br>
<br>
“What now?” Melba asked, looking feebly around the cavern.  She couldn’t see the walls.  The light from their candle wasn’t even able to illuminate the entire dragon.<br>
<br>
“What now??” Veeshan roared with laughter.  The cavern walls shook.  “What now, she asks!!  Tunare, now!”<br>
<br>
Tunare glanced at Melba.  “All I needed to do was get to her.  Touch her.  I can pop us out of here, no trouble.”<br>
<br>
“All this time…you could’ve just ‘popped’ us out of here?”<br>
<br>
“I thought you would like to come with me.  And I knew you were trustworthy,” Tunare answered.<br>
<br>
“How?!”  Melba asked  “How did you know?  I could’ve been one of Bristlebane’s tricksters, like the others!”  Melba looked from the dragon to the goddess.  &quot;And another thing...why no spells?  Why couldn't I heal you?&quot;<br>
<br>
“If you had cast a spell on me, healing or not, Melba, every creature, dead or alive, who falls under my protection would've been after your blood. It's just the way it is, I'm afraid.&quot;  Tunare smiled at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;As for the other thing, you did a selfless act.  You destroyed your weapons, to help me.  You didn’t consider for a moment that you might need them to fight your way out of here.  You just did it.  That proved to me that you were trustworthy.  And a kindly-regarded child of … well, me!”  Tunare grinned again.  Melba stood in silent contemplation, realizing the praise that Tunare gave her was worth more than her life; more than anything she’d ever known.  <br>
<br>
Her contemplation was interrupted when Veeshan roared “Hop on, ladies!”<br>
<br>
Tunare climbed up to the dragon’s neck, and reached down for Melba.  Melba took her hand, and climbed up behind her.  <br>
<br>
“Perfectly safe,” Tunare muttered to her. “Hold on.” <br>
<br>
Tunare glowed golden from every vein, and then all was blackness.<br>
<br>
The popped out, high above the city of Thurgadin.  The cold wind whipped Melba’s hair into her face, and she held tighter onto Tunare’s waist.<br>
<br>
Tunare turned and regarded her.  “I’m getting off here.  I’ve got some dwarven miners to talk to.  We’ve got to get those caves completely sealed up so no more rangers die.  You know how they do like to wander into places they shouldn’t!”<br>
<br>
Melba grinned at her.  “What about Bristlebane?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I’ll take care of him, later.  And you can be SURE Veeshan won’t be caught again, so easily.”  Tunare patted the old dragon on the shoulder.  Veeshan snorted.   Tunare grasped Melba’s hand.  “Thank you so much for your help.  You’ve earned my respect.  Maybe one day I can repay you for your kindness.  Some new spells, or something.  We’ll see…..”  she grinned, touched Melba’s cheek lightly, and disappeared.<br>
<br>
“Hmph,” snorted Veeshan.  “Where to, human?”<br>
<br>
Melba shifted a bit on Veeshan’s neck and said “Can you find my husband?”<br>
<br>
“Find him!  I can smell him!  He’s been digging for HOURS!  Get him a hot bath, would you?”<br>
<br>
Melba laughed as Veeshan banked gently over a snow covered hill and headed towards the hidden cavern entrance where Melba’s dear husband was still digging through the snow.<br>
<br>
*******<br>
<br>
Damdor heard the whooshing before he could see anything.  Standing, leaning against his Wurmslayer, he peered into the distance.  The sun glared off the melting snow.   He’d been digging for 6 hours….finding nothing.  He despaired of any interruption of his search.  But this was definitely an interruption he couldn’t ignore.  Heading towards him across the snowfield, flying at a low altitude, was a giant red dragon.<br>
<br>
“What the….?” He hefted the Wurmslayer to fighting position, determined to stand his ground against the beast, which was obviously headed straight for him.  At least he would fight dying, and die near Melba’s resting place.  <br>
<br>
The roar of the wind caused by the dragon’s wings beating against the snow became deafening as it grew closer.  Snow flurries eddied around underneath her wings, glistening in the sunlight. The dragon came to a position about 100 yards away from the warrior, and backpedaled her wings.  Flapping gently, she landed in the snow with a grunt.  She grinned at him, tongue hanging out of her mouth.<br>
<br>
All Damdor could do was stare.  Then, he thought he should bow.  So he bowed to the dragon.  She roared with amusement.<br>
<br>
“Another human with honor!  I am all astonishment.  Sir, I would bow myself, but as you see, I am old and tired and battered and in no position to be bowing to anyone.   But I bring you something that I believe belongs with you.”  Veeshan turned her head and looked behind her.<br>
<br>
Melba slid from the dragon’s neck to the snow with a thump.  She turned and looked the dragon in the eyes.   The golden eyes glowed at her.  Melba bent on one knee and saluted Veeshan.<br>
<br>
“Oh, Ranger, no need for that!  Your  smelly human over there already did that.  Up.  Up!  Off with you!  And my gratitude, you know.  Accept it.  It’s yours.”  The dragon hooted softly and tapped Melba’s shoulder with her wingtip.  “Off with you!” <br>
<br>
Melba stepped back a ways, and the dragon gathered herself and sprang heavily into the air.  She flew off over the snowy hills, in the direction of Iceclad Ocean.  Melba watched her go.  <br>
<br>
She turned and saw Damdor, standing very still against the snowy hill, Wurmslayer still in his hand in a half salute.  The weapon fell out of his hand, into the snow.  She trudged to him through the shimmering, slush, grinning ear to ear.<br>
<br>
“Hi, hon!  Where are those cream-filled dwarf cakes you promised me??”<br>
<br>
Damdor embraced his wife with such force that she thought he would crack her ribs.  She didn’t mind at all.<br>
<br>

How ever still a great story.  Think you must have been rushed a bit at the end there.  Kinda made me think of Veeshan as a grandmotherly type.<br>
