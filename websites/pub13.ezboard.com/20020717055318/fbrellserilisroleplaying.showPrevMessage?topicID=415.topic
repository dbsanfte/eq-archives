A fellow member of his guild, the Violent Harvest, the Dark Knight nodded once in silent agreement. Before them stood the entrance to the Tower, a swirling cloudlike opening, that seemed to pulsate with cold malevolence. Standing there for a few moments, the two members of the Respected Race let themselves enjoy the ebbs and flows of such power over their bodies and refresh their souls. Then, together they stepped up to touch the “door” of the Tower to be transported inside. Zirrix had come here at the request of the Commander of the Kael Guard, in order to complete a quest for King Tormax. Zirrix was now fully accepted by all factions of the Giant city, and was even considered an ally by the Frost and Storm factions. Slowly, by performing such tasks as this, Zirrix was also elevating his esteem in the eyes of the King himself. Soon he would be considered an ally by all, then he could proceed with negotiations on behalf of the Empire with the leaders of Kael Drakkal. But, for now he was still acting on their behalf. This day, he was joined by the Shadow Knight of Innoruuk, who sought certain items within the Tower for his own purposes. As they sat and discussed strategy just inside the entrance, they were suddenly joined by a fellow Child of Neriak. He was a Necromancer who had come to the Tower for a hidden purpose. What it was, none could know. But, that was true of all Casters, they were secretive, devious and evasive by nature. As the Halflings said, when dealing with such individuals it was “Best to keep the table between you”. Still, he was a member of the Respected Race, and after introductions were made, the three began to form a common plan.<br>
<br>
This was unusual for Zirrix, who preferred to hunt alone, or only in the company of those he knew, such as the Dark Knight with him today. But, neither he nor the Knight of Innoruuk possessed all the keys to the Tower, and the Necromancer did. Zirrix watched the Deathmaster’s movements and listened to his excited speech. Zirrix was torn, he needed the miserable old grave robber to complete his mission, but there was something about him Zirrix did not feel confident about. In the end, the desire to go on, and the company of his fellow Harvester gave Zirrix the incentive to accept the Necromancer and continue. It was a decision he would not live to regret. For the first few floors, all went well. Although the Necromancer’s eyes gleamed with some dark secret, his information regarding the layout of the Tower was correct. Upon reaching the 4th floor of the Tower, it was decided not to fight, but storm the exit to the next level and proceed with their objectives. They had gone a short way in, when Zirrix’s instinct was proven (unfortunately for him) to be correct yet again. As several denizens of the Tower descended upon the three Teir’dal, Zirrix called for them to charge to the “mirror” and exit the floor. Suddenly, the Necromancer’s eyes flashed in ecstasy, and he shouted out “No! Do not run, let us fight these creatures! They cannot stand before me and my power! Join me in the battle!”. Zirrix was, for one of the few times in his long life, stunned into disbelief. It became clear to Zirrix that the Necromancer was quite insane, because no sane person is stupid or idiotic enough to try and defeat the combined forces of this area of the Tower with so small a group, Teir’dal or not. <br>
<br>
Shouting above the sounds of impending doom, Zirrix said, “Fool! We cannot hope to survive this situation, dying in combat is honorable, but wasting the gift of battle is a sin! Let us withdraw to the mirror and escape this lost cause!”. The Necromancer just turned his now empty eyes at Zirrix and began to babble about being “invincible” and “striking down the whole Tower with his displeasure”. As his fellow Harvester fell to the ground, spiting curses and calling down Innoruuk’s wrath upon his killers, Zirrix felt at least three foes begin to rend his flesh and pummel his body. Snarling in fury and disgust, Zirrix turned his back upon his attackers and advanced upon the cause of the debacle. Feeling his life being ripped and beat from his body, Zirrix’s used the last of his strength, and threw his sword at the Necromancer, who was now cowering in a corner bemoaning the loss of his undead servant. Zirrix called out the vengeance of House T’Rhennic upon the wretched fool grave robber, and just as his sword reached it’s mark, Zirrix’s world exploded into blackness with the sickening sound of crushing armor and a wet crunch.<br>
<br>
Zirrix opened his eyes, and knew where he was. He had seen this place before in a vision and in his dreams. He was in the realm of the Great God of Battle Rallos Zek. But something was different, something odd about the surroundings. After a few moments Zirrix realized what it was. He was outside the Keep of Battles, the home place of Rallos Zek. In all his other “visits” he had been within the tower itself. Now he stood alone , in the blank, dark, gray, flat plain. The Keep itself was just barley visible in the far distance, shrouded in a slowly swirling mist of fog. Then, Zirrix heard a voice behind him and turned to see the speaker. His eyes widened in both shock and despair as he recognized the form of the hacked and bloody Dark Knight who had accompanied him into the Tower. Zirrix did not understand how the Knight could be here, he served the Dark Creator Innoruuk, and should be by the side of the Prince of Hate in his shadowy realm, not here in the Place of Battles. Then Zirrix noticed that the Shadow Knight seemed to “flicker” in and out of existence, as if fighting to remain. Before Zirrix could speak, the ghostly Reverent of the Dark Knight spoke and said “ Why General, why did we fail? Why did we die in that frozen place of lost memories? What caused our failure?”. Zirrix could only stand mute, as the sound of the word “failure” seem to echo and grow. It reverberated though out the desolate plain and grew louder still, until it was a screaming, howling accusation. Zirrix pressed his gauntleted hands against his ears, trying to shut out the sounds. As he fell to his knees in agony, the word exploding louder and louder, time and time again in his mind, his eyes were forced open to behold a terrible sight.<br>
<br>
Before him was a cavern, endlessly long and miles wide. It was full of all the races of Norrath, Light-Crawler and Dark-Kin alike, all in a mass at the bottom of the crevasse. Then Zirrix noticed something, something that made his soul freeze in shame and his heart shrivel with anguish. All the Teir’dal in the pit, all the Children of Neriak, all HIS people, were in chains. Only the Teir’dal were shackled together, toiling under the whips of the other races. The Respected Race crawled and toiled, were beaten and degraded by the laughing and leering members of the other races. He knew, as sure as anything he had ever known, that he would remain here, for all eternity to watch this reality. How long had he already watched this scene, a minute, a day, or had the stars already burned out into cold lumps of rock in the skies above Norrath? He did not know, could not know, but it went on and on, because the dead know nothing of time, only that they are dead. Zirrix clawed at his eyes to scratch out the sight, opened his mouth to scream out his fury and sorrow, but the only sound was one word, over and over again. As Zirrix was forced to watch by some unseen hand, he could make out the Teir’dal slaves saying a word, over and over again. It was then, as everything suddenly collapsed upon itself and his vision went black and all grew silent, that Zirrix understood where the deafening sound was coming from, it was the voice of his people in the carven. <br>
<br>
Opening his eyes he saw the scarred and haughty face of Nospiratus, Mad Prophet of the Violent Harvest. Zirrix’s head throbbed, and he could barely move, but he knew what had happened. The Prophet had cast a spell of Resurrection upon the Warrior, and brought him back to Norrath. Looking over, Zirrix saw the Dark Knight had already recovered from the effects of the spell, and gave Zirrix a short salute of  greeting. As his mind cleared, Zirrix quickly turned and looked in the place where he had last seen the Necromancer. There lay his bloodied sword, and a pool of blood. The pool had a trail leading off deeper into the Tower. Zirrix thought, “So, wretched grave robbing imbecile, you survived. Enjoy your brief stay while you may fool, because I shall find you again and make you pay the debt you owe House T’Rhennic!”. Then, the Cleric of Innoruuk bid the two farewell and disappeared off into the night, as if returning the two from the dead was of no more effort then pouring a goblet of wine. As the Warrior and the Dark Knight prepared their camp, Zirrix was suddenly struck with a painful burning in his left hand. Walking into a secluded area, he removed his gauntlet to see what was wrong. He stood, staring in disbelief and horror at what he saw. There was no flesh on his left hand, up to the wrist, it was just white bone. Closing his eyes and clearing his mind, he opened them up again, expecting to see that the delusion had passed. But, it was still there, as obvious and real and the hand of any other skeleton. He flexed his hand, and it worked normally, as it always had. Other then being fleshless, and the constant burning pain, the hand functioned perfectly. In his mind he heard a voice whisper the word “failure”, and understood that this was a constant reminder of such an error. Zirrix knew he was not being punished for failure in battle, but for his failure to himself. He accepted the pain willingly, and silently thanked Rallos Zek for the wisdom of it. Stifling any sounds of pain he might make, Zirrix put his gauntlet back on and returned to camp. As he arrived, the Dark Knight looked up and said, “Ah well, not every victory can be a complete success, we will continue on tomorrow after we are rested”. Nodding Zirrix said, “Indeed Knight of Innrouuk, we shall proceed tomorrow…to victory”. Zirrix did not sleep that night. Nor would he ever sleep another peaceful night again in his long life, with his constant burning reminder…always at hand.            <br>
