<br>
I am basing my conclusions on my testing and observations.  I deliberately did NOT stop whenever I had a fizzle, because I was trying to secondarily test the chain fizzle theory.  I would just spam cast on through and stop only on nonfizzles.   Which is why I said that if there were such a thing as chain fizzling, I would have seen it. <br>
<br>
Of course, if there is such a thing as chain fizzling, there may be such a thing as chain successes.  If the first is based on some quirk of the RNG, then that same quirk would work for successes as well.  If you are going to test this, you should wait 5 or 10 seconds between each attempted cast, regardless of success or fizzle.<br>
<br>
<br>
With a 3% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 0.09%.  Or about 1 in 1000.  Which is what I was seeing with my low fizzle rate spells. <br>
<br>
With a 10% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 1%, or 1 in 100.  You should be seeing a number of double fizzles sequences with these spells.  The odds of a triple fizzle sequence are 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<br>
<br>
With a 30% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 9%, or 1 in 10.  The odds of a triple fizzle are 2.7%.  The odds of a quadruple fizzle are 0.08%, or about 1 in 1000.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have an open mind and am willing to be convinced otherwise.  But you'll have to show me the numbers to do so.<br>

<br>
Hitting cast, duck, duck gets repetetive (I know, it can mesmerize you after a while =).  Were you (out of habit) hitting duck twice even after a fizzle?  Cause if you were, that's still spacing out your casts of the spell, and is two more casts of the spell one could have done quickly, if they were spamming.<br>
<br>
Just curious, and want to understand.<br>
<br>
When I run my experiement tonight, this will be my criteria for judging whether chain-fizzling exists or not.  I will find a low fizzle spell, and if I can get it to chain fizzle an order of magnitude more than its base fizzle rate would indicate, then I'll be convinced.<br>
<br>
I started a thread on this a month or two back that got no/little response.  It's interesting to see it pop up again.<br>
<br>
My theory is that fizzling is determined by the server, and if a fizzle is received, and you spam the key before the server can be contacted again, or before it decides to reset the random number, you automatically get another fizzle.<br>
<br>
The concept of &quot;chain successes&quot; came up.  In normal operations, this is impossible, since cast time + recast time automatically spaces out the casts.  For the purposes of my experiment, just ducking twice after each cast spaces em out a bit.  That's why my idea for tonight's experiment calls for no ducking, and just spamming the key constantly, through casts and fizzles.  I will probably use Burst of Flame or Flame Lick, both low damage, low mana spells.<br>
<br>
Now, onto the other comments I alluded to in the post earlier today, in the other thread:<br>
<br>
Where the hell did the numbers for total damage for our DoTs come from, and don't say spdat, cause they don't add up.<br>
<br>
I looked at Scirocco's thread in the archive re:DoT damage, and I'm inclined to agree with the numbers he comes up with, his method is well done.  Even if you may disagree with him on the total damage, there's little disagreement with his info on the number of ticks each spell lasts.  So look at this:<br>
<br>
Commonly accepted numbers (pre-Scirocco) for our DoTs:<br>
Wrath of Nature 1650    30 ticks<br>
Winged Death    1287    10 ticks<br>
Breath of Ro       920     11 ticks<br>
Drifting Death     650     11 ticks<br>
Drones of Doom  350     11 ticks<br>
Immolate           240     11 ticks<br>
Creeping Crud     210    11 ticks<br>
Stinging Swarm   117    10 ticks<br>
<br>
Now, with the exception of WoN, none of the totals are round multiples of the ticks.  So you're telling me that spdat says WD does 128.7 dmg/tick?  I don't think so!  I can't believe I never noticed this before!<br>
<br>
That brings me to my second comment.  Scirocco mentions that there is a 12% bonus to DoT damage if the mob is not pursuing, a 1/3 penalty if it is.  What I can't figure out is, 12% of what?  Below is Scirocco's #'s for DoTs, then compared with what used to be the accepted numbers:<br>
<br>
Wrath of Nature: 1770 ( 59/tick, 30 ticks)       7.2% greater<br>
Winged Death:    1560 (156/tick, 10 ticks)      21.2% greater<br>
Breath of Ro:    1089 ( 99/tick, 11 ticks)      18.4% greater<br>
Drifting Death:   759 ( 69/tick, 11 ticks)      16.8% greater<br>
Drones of Doom:   374 ( 34/tick, 11 ticks)       6.9% greater<br>
Immolate:         242 ( 22/tick, 11 ticks)       0.8% greater<br>
Creeping Crud:    209 ( 19/tick, 11 ticks)      -0.5% (less)<br>
Stinging Swarm:   110 ( 11/tick, 10 ticks)      -6.0% (less)<br>
<br>
As you can see, none of them is 12% greater than the old accepted values, and some are actually less.  I have a feeling this is due to the fact that the old values are pretty much junk.  So what I'm curious about is, where did this concept of a 12% bonus come from?  I agree with the total damage done (per tick), but what, exactly, is it a 12% bonus of.  And if it's the number in SPDAT, then why are the old numbers not also based on SPDAT?<br>
<br>
Just confused and hope someone can clear it up =) <p>Tatanka WolfDancer, 57th Druid<BR>

<br>
I don't think this adds any significant additional spacing out time...at least, no more than clicking on the spell to recast it after a fizzle will add.   <br>
<br>
As for the DoTs, the 12% is not based on the status of the mob.  It simply is an estimate of how much additional damage the DoT will do in the game over the "listed" amounts (which are from the spell data file).   You get this amount by measuring the amount of damage the DoT does to you, and backing out the PvP reduction (which is based on the damage done to mobs by your DDs vs. the damage the DD does to you, and varies by level of the spell). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/22/02 8:00:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> update</span><hr size=1> 126  attempts<br>

<br>
im not sure whether a higher consecutive fizzle rate would be just perception or fact however.  when i ran my 500 trials, i did so in sets of 100, stopping only after each set.  when i had a fizzle i immediately tried recasting (trying to shorten the trial time by constant casting).  i actually came out with a lower consecutive fizzle rate than i was expecting. <p>-K<br>

Yeah, your fizzles are running WAY higher than mine.  In my 300+ trials, I only had 3 double fizzles, and no triple or higher.  And less than half the fizzle rate you saw.  Are you Evoc specced?<br>
