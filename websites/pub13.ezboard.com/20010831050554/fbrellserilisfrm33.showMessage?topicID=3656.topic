Okay, this is a very long story made quite a bit shorter because I'll get CTS if I type it all the way out.<br>
<br>
I met this girl named Jennifer in high school. My sophomore year. I already had a girlfriend, but found Jen's personality extremely appealing and magnetic. She and I remained psuedo-distant friends throughout high school until our senior year. She and I were both single and started hanging out quite a bit. <br>
<br>
On valentines day of our senior year, I gave her a rose, a baloon and a card (hey! it was all i could afford delivering pizza!). She gave me a card in return which said something along the lines of &quot;I want you to be more than a friend to me, but I'm just not ready for that yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
What a crock of @#%$, I thought. <br>
<br>
Well, we remained friends over the summer, but I was dating someone else. <br>
<br>
One night, I was driving home from work, and spun out of control, almost hitting a car. It freaked me out, and for some reason, the only thing I could think of was &quot;I have to call Jennifer.&quot;<br>
<br>
I invited her over that night, and kissed her. Talk about a rush. We looked at eachother and she said, &quot;you've gotta tell Amy.&quot; (the girl I was dating at the time.)<br>
<br>
So, I did. Amy and I broke up and I started dating Jennifer. We had a great relationship for 3 years. And then something that would change my life, and hers, happened.<br>
<br>
She came over one day and wanted to go to dinner. At dinner she said she has something to ask me and it's very important. <br>
<br>
&quot;Wanna go to Guam,&quot; she asks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where the HELL is Guam,&quot; I reply.<br>
<br>
So, she tells me this story about her uncle and aunt who live there and are starting some business. They want her to babysit and help them with their books. She wants to go because they'll pay her to go to school as well. <br>
<br>
I needed to think about it.<br>
<br>
I talked to some friends, my family and, of course, her about it. I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to go. It wasn't that I couldn't go, but that I didnt want to. It was scary. It was a commitment that I wasnt ready for. So, I walked her to the gate at the airport, gave her a kiss, a hug and a necklace that I had the other half of, and said &quot;see ya later.&quot;<br>
<br>
We kept in touch, as well as you can when someone you love is in Guam. We emailed eachother and called eachother for a few minutes at a time. <br>
<br>
She came home for christmas. <br>
<br>
Then she left again, and I didnt hear from her for months. I called and I wrote to her. No responce. I called her mom, and she wouldn't return my calls. <br>
<br>
Months passed. Nothing.<br>
<br>
Then, it happened. IT.<br>
<br>
She called. And she acted like nothing was wrong. All chipper and stuff. apparantly a typhoon hit the island and knocked electricity and phone out. Took them a long time to get things back in order. But that wasn't the only reason why she hadn't called.<br>
<br>
She met someone else.<br>
<br>
She had been working at a restaurant part time and she had started dating her manager. Soon after this, she started living living with him. <br>
<br>
She was engaged to him now. She would be coming back to the states in a month and meeting his parents in new orleans and then going to a wedding with him in minnesota and then coming back to the bay area after that. <br>
<br>
she wanted me to meet him.<br>
<br>
i couldnt do that. there was no way i could do that. i felt like someone threw a medicine ball at my chest without me looking. it hurt so bad.<br>
<br>
we talked for a bit longer. I was furious. she had decieved me. i didnt know what to do. we got off the phone and i cried. <br>
<br>
July.<br>
<br>
She called, but not to talk to me. She wanted to talk to my mom about her bank account that my mom managed at her credit union. <br>
<br>
I havn't heard from her since. That was 3 years ago.<br>
<br>
Now, for some reason, I'm having dreams about her.  Random stuff, that makes no sence. I can't remember the dreams, really, because I wake up from them and have a million things going through my head. 3 years of memories rush through my head in 30 seconds, and I forget what the dream is about. <br>
<br>
I want to contact her. I want to know how she is. I want to see her. <br>
<br>
But I'm scared. It scares me to have feelings, still, about someone that hurt me so badly and hasn't contacted me at all. <br>
<br>

Sometimes old memories resurface after awhile. I'm no pshychologist but maybe you should call her, its always good to talk to old friends. You never want to at first but afterwards I always feel better about myself for doing it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umahannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mahannon </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/12/01 9:43:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haunting dreams of ex girlfriends</span><hr size=1> Sounds rather Kafka-esque.<br>
<br>
I've found that the best way to deal with a desire to contact ex-girlfriends is to take a stiff drink and then slam your hand in a door, it'll hurt less and it'll give you something else to think about for awhile.<br>
<br>
Seriously though, you're just going to end up torturing yourself by reliving the whole situation.  There's nothing to be done for it, and it's best to just let it go.  Sure it won't stay away forever, all that bullshit about closure is precisely that, that's what makes it so hard.  But it's better to try and forget it than to agonize over what you said, and what she said, trying to find out if there was anything you could have done differently.  That doesn't get you anywhere, what's done is done.  I won't presume to tell you what to do, but sometimes it's enough to know when you've been beat and chalk it up to experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uyementhewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yemen the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boy Band groupie</span><br>  Posts: 772<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/12/01 9:59:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/edit/raw/image/06/3130006.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haunting dreams of ex girlfriends</span><hr size=1> Wow..

Maybe she is going through something and needs you but is afraid to call you.  Maybe I'm wrong and you are feeling some sort of regret or anxiety about other things in your life.  Either way I don't think that it could hurt to contact her.  Find out how she's doing.  It may be the best thing you've done in years.

<br>
Do you know her number down there?  What do you think her reaction would be if you called?<br>
<br>
I think you should take the memories and leave it at that.  Calling her can make it worse.  Hearing her voice might unearth some feelings again.  If shes gone for good, then theres really not much you can do, except cherish any memories you have.  <br>
<br>
Unless you wanna actually move there, i gotta say don't call.  <br>
<br>
Of course, if you think you can speak to her in a strictly friends mannor, and have genuine curiosity to her well being (who wouldnt after that amount of time), then do it.  I just fear it would make things worse contacting her.<br>

I always wanna find out why, and the reason is usually a really crappy totally self absorbed reason. This one girl come to mind when i read your story. We were friends for like two years and started dating. We dated for like three years, talked about getting married and all that jazz. Then one day i find out she's been sleeping with one of my best friends. I was really hurt. But i'm a pretty chipper guy, so i got over it after like 6 or 7 months. Any ways, after a while i started wanting to call her and see how she was. I repressed this urge for like 5 years. Finally i did get in touch with her. I saw the same old person. Except when i saw her at that time, i realized that she was always a jerk and not just for those few fleeting moments that she had been cheating on me. A self absorbed princess, only concerned with her own well being. And i also realized i never really liked her at all, it was just a sex thing. Any ways, maybe if you contact her you'll get  some new insight as to the person she is, and it will help you get her out of yer mind. Worked for me *Shrug*<br>

<br>
<br>
5 Years ago I met the most amazing girl, everything about her could only be explained as magical.  I can never forget her, what she looked like, her smile...<br>
<br>
We got seperated for a short while when I was in another state, I told her she didnt have to wait even tho I would only be gone for 6 months..  <br>
<br>
When I came back the girl I know was destroyed by a guy she met, he introduced her to drugs and just used her... and there was nothing I could do.<br>
<br>
4 Years later I still think about her, even tho I have been with the same girl for 3 years now and I do love her.  I feel that I should try to contact her to see how she is doing and to help release the ghosts that still stick with me.  I guess I hope that shes nothing like the girl I remember, so I can let go.<br>
<br>
I feel for you Jester, it's really up to you though.  Will talking to her and seeing how she has changed help you let her go, or make it worse?  I know I haven't had the courage to contact her myself so I can't blame you.  Whatever you do I wish you luck.<br>

I still have feelings for a guy I dated a few years back.  I also wonder what he is up to quite often.  At the time, I did poorly in relationships at the time and was too self centered.  So I wrecked what we had.<br>
<br>
I often wonder what would be if I had been a more mature person...<br>
<br>
From reading the post, I got the impression that you felt the seperation was just a long distance relationship.  That she would return some day and things would pick up where they left off.  Unfortunately, it rarely works that way.  Most people feel a need to be near, someone.  Talking on the phone and writing emails can only do so much when truly trying to &quot;share.&quot;  It puts alot of strain on relationships.<br>
<br>
My advice:  Don't seek her out.  Try to remember the good times; and think well of her.  Yes, she hurt you deeply, but she may have felt hurt by your choice of not going with her and may of taken it as a sign of some sort.<br>
<br>
I don't believe in the concept of &quot;one&quot; true love.<br>

We are all different and everyone has encountered similar situations, but they are almost always unique in there own way.  I have done some heartbreaking, and have had my heartbroken as well.  Things happen, it's easy for those of us without this current situation to say get over it and move on.  However, it isn't always that easy a thing to do.  The emptiness left in your heart isn't an easy thing to get over and there is only one thing to mend wounds of the heart and that is time.  Time cures a lot of ailments, broken bones, sickness, and broken hearts, their is no estimated time of recovery from a broken heart.  The last time my heart was broken I found myself getting in conversations with new women and people and after about 2 minutes I would lose any interest in the conversation at hand, because I would find myself thinking about the past.  It wasn't until I was finally able to hold a conversation and interest in a new person for more than 15 minutes that I would realize that yes, indeed I was finally over my broken heart.<br>
<br>
  My advice is to not spend much time alone, go hang with some friends, talk about everyday type stuff and just try to move on as best you can.  You must cherish what you had in the past with her and you can keep those memories forever, but when you torment yourself over what may never be again you are only making matters worse.  Lighten up a little go out with some friends and have a good time.  I find the times I have the most fun is when I am not out looking to meet someone new.  Just out having fun with friends, family and realizing that there are people that care plenty for me, without that ex-gf in my life.  Hope you can find some consolation in the advice offered you in these pages here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umahannon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mahannon </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/15/01 12:13:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haunting dreams of ex girlfriends</span><hr size=1> Ooh, my turn to give an anecdote.  Similar situation with different details.  In this case it was just a friendship that went down the tubes, but we were fairly close.<br>
<br>
I'd known her about 4 years, I'd been mildly infatuated with her, but it wore off shortly as she wasn't really the sort of woman that I pursue romantically.  Nonetheless we had a fair amount in common and our personalities complemented each other, she also shared my cynical, contemptuous view of our peers.  She was already involved with another guy, and I was exploring the delights of underaged drinking and chasing skirts.  We enjoyed each other's company and we were both content to leave it at that.  However, somewhere along the line something went wrong, although to this day I don't know what.  Rarely would a day go by where we would pass 2 dozen words between us, when heretofore we'd spent hours having conversations about art, politics, music, what have you.  Seeing as she was my friend, I was naturally somewhat concerned, and I begin making circumspect inquiries to see if I couldn't coax out of her what the problem was.  No dice, my (to my mind) delicate prodding earned me the combination stonewall and cold shoulder.  At this point I'm extremely confused, and more than a little angry.  Confused, because I figure if she would be talking to anyone about it, it would be me, and angry due to my own inability to figure it out what it is on my own, and her mysterious and unprecedented decision to summarily end our friendship of four years.  Eventually I just gave it up as a lost cause, confrontation got me precisely nothing, and even though we moved in the same circles it was awkward and uncomfortable to be around her.  Then one day, completely out of the blue, she pulled me aside and told me, in a dubiously cheerful tone, that she'd been diagnosed with clinical depression.  Having dropped this bombshell on me, she turned on her heel and walked away.  After that, nothing for over a month.  Then, just before winter vacation she did the same bit, grabbing me by the hand for a private tete a tete.  Two years later, this is the only part it still hurts to remember, in light of what happened after.  She told me that was allright, and that I shouldn't worry about her, she would be able to take care of herself.  The next time I saw her it was like talking to one of the pod people from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, everything about her was eerily familiar, but somehow horribly wrong.  It was as if her entire personality had changed, that is except for in respect to me.  I learned through third parties that she'd been put on meds and had been going to therapy, hence her drastic change in temperament.  I spent a lot of time being pissed off at myself, at her, at society in general; it all just seemed so horribly unfair.  I tried to attempt some sort of reconcilliation, but things just weren't the same.  There just wasn't room left for me in her new mood stabilized and analyzed life, she didn't need a bitter pessimist hanging around cramping her style.  In retrospect I took a lot of it out on my other friends, and if any of them happen to be reading this and recognize me from the events described I'd like to say I'm sorry guys, you took a lot of misdirected @#%$ you didn't deserve.  Later that year I left to go to college in Boston, and I decided to make a mostly clean break.  I never thought about trying to get a hold of her after that, I'd already said everything I could say and I didn't feel like reliving the whole experience over again.  Eventually I got over it, and I can look back on it without feeling bitter.  In the end she just didn't need me anymore, and as little as I like to say it, I didn't need her anymore either.  If I were to see her on the other side of a crowded street tommorrow, I think I'd just keep on walking.  Some things are best left alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usepnevermore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SepNevermore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Runs with Scissors</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/15/01 6:10:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Haunting dreams of ex girlfriends</span><hr size=1> Although I didnt read 99% of what he wrote, just scrolling down with my eyes, I'd agree with Mahannon from the last sentence of his reply.  I've had a similar situation arise, and well, to be frank, following your heart doesnt always work out.<br>
Dreams are just that, Dreams. Non fictional images that cascade through your mind while you doze. She's married, happy or not, and obviously even though you care about her after all this time, calling her  up at this point seems moot to me.  But, like Binge, I'm pretty good at messing up pseudo relationships also, so who knows?  /shrug<br>
