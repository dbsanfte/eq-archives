<br>
One simple non-raid related answer is that prior to 50, no mobs summon you, which facilitates a druid's most common exping activity, kiting.  So, basically, at 50+, suddenly you can't kite mobs that are your level.  Yeah, yeah, I know, a lot of druids never did try to kill mobs their own level -- those druid are just exp-grinders.  Personally, I always liked the challenge of killing as tough a mob as I reasonably could, and still trying to get my exp bar to move upwards. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126501">Abru</a>, Elder Hierophant on The Nameless,  <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/index.shtml" target=_top>Legacy of Steel</a>, <a href="mailto:AbruEQ@hotmail.com">AbruEQ@hotmail.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 1:10:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27062.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Bards Kite.<br>

Also, pre-50 necros and shamans can root/dot far better than druids can (shamans can slow/dot/melee with pet, and necros can fear kite solo).  I also found my magician can solo far more effectively than my druid used to be able to (not touching on post 50 life ;p).   Oh and if people complain about classes pre-35 give me a break.  Melee classes can get weapons like centi long-sword for dirt-cheap and totally own low levels while casters are still stuck with their underpowered low level spells.  Add in a fungi tunic and it gets quite ridiculous (albiet, fungi are more expensive now ;p).<br>
<br>
Opps, forgot to mention quad-kiting.  That wasnt even done pre-kunark, it came about a month or so after Kunark came into existence when I was around 51 ;p.  Even then, the first truly effective quad-kite spell is at 49 for druids, but leveling that way is still slow cause of 10+ minute downtime, no significant mana regen spells till 60, and very few places to quadkite that are all over-crowded (CS, raptors post 50).   <p>Fayne Dethe<BR>

I think that, coming from a PVP perspective, the druid is so versitile in PVP that they can kill almost everyone in almost every situation. (Tanks are a tough one in dungeons, but a well played druid is better off then a wizard or an enchanter.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> List of Problems</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1. Winged Death - This is too strong. Too fast. Too easy to cast and then bail.<br>
2. No balance of abilities - Every class is dependent on others for support. A druid doesn't have nearly as many limitations (it can heal, port, nuke, buff and dot).<br>
3. Unkillable - A well played druid is like a well played Pally, unkillable.<br>
4. Common - There are more druids then needed in every single situation thinkable.<br>
5. Quad-kiting - Nuff Said.. like wizards, it's a really nice thing to have.<br>
<br>
These are all major reasons why druids are so disliked. Druids aren't balanced because they can do everything. They step on other classes toes in almost everything but pets. Yet they still manage to whine about stuff (not that it is unwarrented, just that it is irritating). <br>
<br>
As a mage, I am faced with the same plight you are, lack of a defined role post-50. Pre-50, you are a god-class. You can easily solo (like a necromancer), plus you can port, plus you can group better then most, plus you have the most utility pre-50 of any class (bards are iffy, but I still think ports &gt; *). In reality, you have absolutely nothing wrong. No limitations. That's the &quot;over-balanced&quot; part. You aren't restrained by any problems. (excluding of course, your leather armor) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lunariel>lunariel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 2:33:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27062.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes Druids &quot;Over Balanced&quot; prior to 50?</span><hr size=1> From what I've read of the history of the game, Druids were the most powerful 2 years ago, especially soloing. Then VI rooted us to let the other classes catch up. VI even stated that they wanted to reduce the popularity of Druids. Now over half the classes can solo better (overall DPS) than us, but people are still a bit slow and haven't realized this yet. Also a lot of people wants to have a class to hate. Druids were easy targets back then and old habits die hard.<br>
<br>
Druids are perhaps still the easiest class to play for casual soloers, so there are still a lot of us around. But it's no longer a power class, others have taken that spot. Unfortunately the high end raid scene was fleshed out during these last 2 years which left the Druids near the bottom of list. Only flawed game design for pets saved us from ending up last.<br>
<br>
Druids are still rooted. Luclin didn't bring anything new and Wolf Form is still KoS. But since 'The Vision' is now dead and buried, there is a chance that the new dev team might drop the root and settle with a snare instead. <br>

Except for very few points at various pre-hell-level-don't-have-my-new-heal-yet stages, the druid was very well balanced.  The druid heals were good enough to put you into a 50's main healer position, and you had some of the better DD's in the game (speaking of pure dmg, not mana ratio).<br>
<br>
When you added Kunark into the mix, things went haywire.  1500HP was no longer a lot of hit points.  Our DD's were still nice, but our DoT's are what really caught us up.  Healing suffered a lot.  We could no longer be very good main healers unless you planned at being around 20% mana the whole time you're in a single group.  You'd be lucky if you had the WIS/Mana to keep a warrior alive in Sebilis.  More than likely, the only reason you were being invited into groups was for your evac abilities.  (Remember, chloroblast and Nature's Touch weren't added until later).  Regrowth of the Grove was nice, but it probably wasn't going to save your butt from a quad 100pt attack.<br>
<br>
With Velious we really started to suffer.  Our new spells were neat, but all of our buffs were mostly useless.  Girdle of Tunare was nothing compared to Focus.  Why take a druid with PotG when you had a cleric with Aego?  Yes, the mana regen was nice, but that's not going to do a whole lot for your tank.  Our DS was never used with a mage around.  We had self-mana recovery spells now, but too bad they're all outdoors only, and probably made you KoS to 90% of the population.<br>
<br>
Now we're at Luclin and our buffs are pretty much completely useless.  Some of the casting classes might still like to get a PoTG now and then, but trying to keep PoTG with Marzin is annoying.  Plus, since clerics now have Blessed Armor of the Risen, they don't even need PoTG.  Our DS is still second class, our new SoW breaks DMF, Nature's Recovery is pretty much a single-target buff only; which is very underpowered, and our indoor self-mana regen spell seems to drop only on one mob, 2% of the time.<br>
<br>
Pre-Kunark, and a little bit after Kunark's release, we were the class to be.  We could level faster than most other classes, we could heal, damage, buff, port, manaregen, the whole she-bang.  Quad-kiting wasn't around as much, we didn't really have the mana ratio for it, and not many locations existed.  Why were we considered &quot;over-powered&quot;?  It was because of our ability to solo *and* our ability to group.  Can't find a group in Guk?  Go out to solo guards, giants, Cyclopes, etc.  The fact was, we could get xp in both dungeons with groups and solo.  Not only could we do it, we could do it well.<br>
<br>
Now? <br>
<br>
Now we work well solo, and we work as a good &quot;filler&quot; in a group.  You can still solo your way to level 60 and 2340983 AA points (boring as it is), but you're by no means the fastest leveler anymore.  In raids you're the fill CB heal on the main tank in between CH's.  If you're lucky, you'll get to debuff fire resist on some mob.<br>
<br>
That's all immaterial though.  <br>
<br>
What makes other classes &quot;think&quot; we're overpowered? <br>
That's easy.<br>
It's druids.<br>
<br>
Druids were the ones who were PL'd to level 50 in 4 days played.  Druids were some of the first lvl 60's.  Druids were the ones to get their epic made easier.  Druids were the ones who got new heals to &quot;balance&quot; them.<br>
<br>
All the while, druids were the ones who would complain about being underpowered, then in the same breath tell you how they quad-kite raptors for xp in TD.  The &quot;image&quot; of the druid as being overpowered is that which is perpetuated by the druid and accepted by the rest of the classes.  The &quot;image&quot; of the druid is the one being shown by the ass in Cobalt Scar quad kiting 4 out of the 20 total wyverns spawned, training other groups when Yvolcarn or Azuredrake spawns.  The &quot;image&quot; of the druid is the one shown to others as a level 60 camping a level 40 mob to twink their lower level character instead of giving the camp to a group who could get xp there.<br>
<br>
Druids are their own worst enemy, and our reputation precedes us.   <p><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#CCCCCC">

Cept that WD thing is out of place, but just take your average dot at that level + your average nuke at that level and compare it to any other class and you pretty much have the picture. <br>
<br>
I don't think PVP = PVE, cause it doesn't. But from my perspective, that's why they are overpowered in PVP and PVE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorrun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 5:04:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27062.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What makes Druids &quot;Over Balanced&quot; prior to 50?</span><hr size=1> The simple answer to your question, I think, is "versitility".  There is a lot more power in that one ability then many druids realize or want to admit.<br>
<br>
The more complicated answer is that I dont think the concept of having to "pay" for past advantages is reasonable.  It really makes no sense.  What I do think is reasonable is that druids of all levels have to accept that with verstility comes lack of specialized skills.  You cant have it both ways although it is very obvious that several high level druids around here want exactly that now that they are 60 and the need for versatitly isnt near as great as it was from 1-55 (although you can be sure they took full advantage of that for 55 levels).  If anything, it is an interesting, even ironic twist.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that raids are all about efficency and that requires specialzed skills to get things accomplished with the least amount of grief.  This goes against most of what it means to be a druid.  <br>
<br>
Is there room for improvement?  Sure.. but there isnt much room before you start unbalancing other classes and more or less infringing on specialized skills.  Combine even one specialzed skill with an inheirent versatility and you get one overpowered class.  I think I saw that recipe in a magazine once.  :)<br>
<br>
To be honest, I think druids pose a huge problem to Verant when class balance is being discussed.  Every other "hybrid" has some kind of check to help balance them out... druids dont really have a clear cut check except to have no specialzed skills.  In a way, what our petition is asking for is weaker specialized skill to help in raids... any way you cut it, that is asking for trouble with regard to overall balance. <p><table border="0">

I know that.<br>
<br>
How many times have you read in the last few days/weeks &quot;Druids are so good in the beginning, that you don't deserve any upgrades in the endgame&quot;?<br>
<br>
I just wanted to find out what we were so good at, that formed that proposition from all the *new blood* that has been steered here.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
1) Kiting?  We aren't the only ones(laugh all you want at my examples).<br>
<br>
2) Killing red mobs solo?  Ya, done that, but what a waste of time...It's more of I did it because I could, than anything else.<br>
<br>
3) PvP Servers?  4 out of 40 servers is what determines what this class has or does not have?  Jboot, Tboots, and horses have totally negated ANY PvP advantage(and that was not much considering you Redders have resist gear up the bu++).<br>
<br>
<br>
Keep 'em coming,,,<br>
<br>
What exactly does a young druid have that somehow needs to be *paid* for later in the game.<br>

This is patently false, even by VERANT'S standards.<br>

<br>
A) Not really (that's my opinion, but I'm pretty sure most folks on the team would agree). Again, we're going to have to determine things like that in a more quantitative way than just &quot;believe&quot;. Personally, I think magicians are pretty much in line up to about 50. After that, if a few issues could be worked out, I think they'd be right back in line. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  But don't discount the value of being able to solo pretty easily in the early levels.

<br>
Note the part that is in bold.  Just because a class is able to solo in the early game does NOT mean it should be left behind in the end game.  That is a direct quote from verant and they are NOT talking about druids.<br>
<br>
Whine bitch and moan about druids being able to solo all you want, but Verant, the makers of the game, have deamed that to be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  an invalid argument</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

Just let the 'But you can solo so you should get shafted later&quot; argument DROP.<br>

For those that do not already know, that was a response to Mages soloing ability, not Druids.<br>
<br>
I DO NOT want to let it drop.  Not yet, not here now.<br>
<br>
It is a prevalent perception, as we have seen lately.  I want to find out where the perception comes from and dispell it. <br>
<br>
No one has come close, yet.<br>
<br>
Is it Solo-ability?  There are many solo classes that do not receive the vehement anathama that we get.

That is most likely a large piece of the answer you are looking for... overturning that perception will take time. <p><table border="0">
