Thurgadin. <br>
· Faction: + Coldain, + DainFrstreaverIV, - Kromzek, - Kromrif <br>
· Small amount of experience <br>
<br>
PEOPLE <br>
<br>
· Frundle located in a shop next to Garish’s Boots (area 19-EqAtlas) in Thurgadin. <br>
· Loremaster Borannin located on right side of platform in the Temple of Brell (area 21-EqAtlas) in Thurgadin. <br>
· Tanik Greskil located in Eastern Wastes. Tanik is a wandering NPC that is found around the ramp to Kael <br>
Drakkal. When you find Tanik you will get the message, “over a pile of snow exposing a <br>
Coldain!” He will be on his side a short distance away. I gave him the Vail of Velium and he disappeared, but I <br>
had the Letter in my inventory. <br>
<br>
*Take a piece of food or something from your inventory and use it to click around the area. If you click on the trap that releases the Death Squad it will say something like "You are too far away from You to trade". If you click on the Tanik trap that spawns him you will get a message that states "You are too far away from You to stumble". It is the fastest way to find them. Keep trying until you get Tanik.<br>
<br>
I was able to trigger 3 Death Squads and 1 Tanik in less than 30 minutes using this method. The trap is random, not just on the ramp.*<br>

Part 5 <br>
Coldain Prayer Shawl<br>
<br>
Step 1 Go to Rexx Frostweaver and say 'what prayer shawl?' he will hand you a Bile Extractor to assist you with this quest.<br>
<br>
Step 2 Gather ingredients<br>
<br>
Step 3 Combine 5 Silk Threads in a Coldain Tanners Kit to make 1 Crystalline Silk Fiber. You need 15 Crystalline Silk Fibers total.<br>
<br>
Step 4 Combine 3 Crystalline Silk Fibers + 1 Shardwurm bile in the Bile Extractor (Given to you by Rexx Frostweaver)<br>
<br>
Step 5 Combine 5 Glowing Crystalline Silks + 4th shawl to create the 5th Shawl. (If you fail, you will get back your 4th Shawl). <br>
<br>
<br>
SHOPPING LIST<br>
1 Bile Extractor (Container, NO DROP) - Rexx Frostweaver in Thurgadin<br>
75 Crystalline Silk Threads (Non-Stackable, Tradeable) - Velketor<br>
5 Glowing Worm Bile (Non-Stackable, NO DROP) - Eastern Wastes<br>
<br>
PEOPLE<br>
Rexx Frostweaver is a vendor located in the Thurgadin Exchange. (EQ Atlas 17)<br>
<br>
I recommend u get the Bile before you get the Threads so as u collect the threads u can combine them. I averaged about 1 bile per 15-20 Shardwurms. With a 57 mage and 60 wizard I was able to pull non stop and get enough bile in 2 hours. *note: both Elder and Young Shardwurms drop bile*<br>
<br>
The Crystalline Threads drop ONLY from Crystalline Spiders (Crystalline Devourer, Crystalline Watcher, etc.) in Velketor’s Lab. All spiders can be placeholders for the crystalline spiders so just keep everything clear. These spiders seem to drop quite a few quest gems so you can make some pp while you get the threads.<br>
<br>
When you obtain the bile and are hunting in Velketor’s, it helps to have both the Bile Extractor and your Coldain Tanning Kit with you. Combine 5 spider threads in a Coldain Tanner’s Kit to make one Crystalline Silk Fiber. Once you have 3 of the fibers you can combine them with the bile in the Bile Extractor. This helps to save room because the bile and the fibers are all non-stackable.<br>
<br>
<br>
Part 6 <br>
Embroidered Prayer Shawl<br>
<br>
Step 1 First go to Betti Frostreaver and say, “What embroidered prayer shawl?” <br>
She will hand you a pattern.<br>
<br>
Step 2 Collect ingredients<br>
<br>
Step 3 Combine 1 Woven Giants Beard + 2 Manticore Manes + 2 Drakkel Dire Wolf Whiskers + 2 Siren Hairs to make Thread.<br>
<br>
Step 4 Combine Thread + Pattern (given to you by Betti Frostreaver) + 5th Shawl<br>
*If you fail, you will be given the 5th shawl back*<br>
<br>
<br>
SHOPPING LIST<br>
1 Woven Giants Beard (LORE, Non-Stackable) - Great Divide<br>
2 Siren Hairs (NO DROP) – Cobalt Scar <br>
2 Manticore Manes (Non-Stackable) - Eastern Wastes<br>
2 Drakkel Dire Wolf Whiskers (NO DROP) - Great Divide<br>
<br>
<br>
There are 2 main areas I am aware of where Sirens spawn. Behind the Skyshrine ramp down at the waters edge you can see 3 from above and 2 in the water a little bit deeper. Near the Sirens Grotto Cave underwater there are 4 guarding the cave. *Warning: Sirens do charm so be careful with pets, tanks, etc. and have those stuns memmed*<br>
<br>
As a suggestion I would recommend obtaining duplicate items for anything that is not lore just in case you do fail. It’s much easier to get extra components while your hunting for the items anyway as opposed to failing and have to go back and redo everything. <br>
<br>
<br>

NOTES<br>
You are going to need several different containers for this quest including but not limited to Jewelry Kit, Coldain Tanners Kit, Fletching Kit.<br>
<br>
*WARNING* The Cutlass Fish are edible so if you’re going to keep them in your bags make certain they’re beneath your food.<br>
<br>
There is a difference between a small piece of velium and a small block of velium. The pieces are stackable and can be obtained in 3 main locations that I am aware of, Skyshrine, Crystal Caverns, and Velketor’s.<br>
<br>
Kael blood is dropped from Vorken and Klaggan Iceshard in Iceshard Keep. Heading from Eastern Wastes you pass over the first bridge and head to the area that has 3 directions. If you head straight you continue to go to WL, but you want to go left, past the ice pond where a “fisherman” is standing. Inside the building is both Vorken and Klaggan. These two mobs can be pulled solo but you will need to clear out the mobs on the way to keep from adds (if you are a wizard you can disintegrate 90% of the outside mobs). There is 1 wanderer and 7 others. Both Klaggan and Vorken hit hard, cast, heal, and GATE. They cannot be stunned so just burn toward the end. 3 – 4 people who are 55+ should be able to do this no problem. Also, the blood seems to be about a 1 in 4 drop.<br>
<br>
One good thing about the burin is that you get it back after using it in the combinations. What this means is that regardless of how the quest turns out you will not have to obtain another Ulthork Tusk, Molkor Hide, or Swordfish Tooth. <br>

<br>
From page 69 of Secrets of the Ancient Druid Masters, now available in paperback:<br>
<br>
<i>Sirens in Cobalt Scar appear to be a tough catch at first impression, but are a pushover for a handsome druid with the right pickup lines. They drop hair for the Coldain Shawl quest (7th shawl) about 1 in 10 to 15 kills, and Excellent Scales for the Outcast Siren quest at about the same rate (perhaps a bit more often).<br>
<br>
Start with the trio on the beach at the Point (west of the Wyvern Tower with the zone to Skyshrine). You can walk to the top of the steep slope on the north and view them from there (be sure not to knock any fellow peeping toms down the cliff, as this will tend to make the ladies quite irate). You should be able to target each of the three from up top.<br>
<br>
Prepare yourself with magic resistance and a regeneration spell, in addition to your normal buffs.<br>
<br>
Target the nearest lass, then back away from the edge due east towards the Tower until you are just out of rooting range. You can test this by trying to cast root (but canceling it before it goes off!) and moving back until you get the message that the target is out of range. Now move back slightly into range, cast root, followed immediately by ensnare. Now BACK UP a few steps!<br>
<br>
While you are now out of rooting range, you can still cast your DoTs. Show the lass the depths of your affection through Winged Death and your quest bracer/ES vambraces DoD. Then sit and med, keeping the siren up as your target.<br>
<br>
The trick here is that the sirens' casting range is equal to the druid casting range for root and snare, and thus a druid can cast DoTs while out of range of the siren's spells. In fact, even at root range you will avoid their most pernicious spells. Distance makes the heart grow fonder!<br>
<br>
If you get the message that your root broke, immediately stand up, cast root, then back up out of root range again. You may take a hit or two from a siren spell, but they are easily rooted and you should be able to get out of range again without too much difficulty. This is why the use of Ensnare at the start is so important.<br>
<br>
Occasionally you will get a message at the start that the root didn't take effect. If so, immediately re-root and back up quickly and proceed as above. If you were so fast that you started casting Ensnare before you found out that the root broke, go ahead and let the Ensnare finish, then re-root, back up, and proceed as above. The key here is to minimize the damage and maintain distance.<br>
<br>
Each of the three can be handled in turn like this for druids of the appropriate level. Some will gate if you root them far from their spawn point, which gives even more incentive for dealing with them in place. If one does gate on you, however, you know where it is, and can DoT it from a distance by moving back to just within range.<br>
<br>
After the trio, there is another siren above the water, often a higher level than the trio, on a lone rock on the south side of the Point. You cannot see her from the top of the cliffs, but you can levitate down while invisible (sirens don't see invisible), target her, then go back to the top and cast from there. Alternatively, you can head along the water's edge east from her to maximum distance, and root her from there. Be careful about straying out above the water to the south and southwest here, as there are several sirens under the water who will be more than happy to show you how affectionate they can be.<br>
<br>
The sirens under the water around the Point can be handled by a variant of the above method. Go invis, swim up, target the lovely creature of your desires, then swim away to beyond root range and proceed from there. Swimming makes it a bit tougher to back away, but it can be done. You won't be able to see her, of course, and if she has any friends in the area, you will need to take care of them as well before inspecting the corpses.<br>
<br>
There are four sirens under the water in front of cave leading to the zone to Siren's Grotto. These can be picked off one at a time using the above methods as well. I approach from the east, underwater, at the base of the cliff (in order to minimize the possibility of sharks and other fish joining in). Target the nearest lass, back off (which will be beyond the sharp bend in the cliff wall to the east), and root/dot as above. You will need to kill all 4 quickly, though, to prevent the first corpse or two from decaying prematurely. </i><br>
