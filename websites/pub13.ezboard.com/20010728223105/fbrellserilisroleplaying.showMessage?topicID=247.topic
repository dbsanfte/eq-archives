Eventually his uncomprehending eyes rose to meet the gaze of the two men standing in the doorway of his cramped room.<br>
“Wha—,” he chirped, his unnatural voice cracking. Ernst cleared his throat and tried again.  <br>
“What exactly do you mean, ‘You killed the burgomeister’?”<br>
“I take exception to that accusation,” shot back one of the standing pair, fending off the comment with an upraised finger.  Holder Crosspen was a thin man, with prematurely gray hair.  His eyes were hidden behind glasses with lenses tinted so darkly as to be opaque.  “We did not kill the burgomeister.”<br>
“Yes, quite right,” agreed his shirtless companion, Mynilar Sannom, idly scratching at his pierced navel.  “We merely allowed him to die.  That’s quite different, you know.”<br>
Ernst sat back in his chair, lightly rubbing his left temple. Like his room, Ernst kept himself impeccably tidy.  “But you did say he is now lying in four pieces on our carpet.  What did he die from?  Melancholy?”<br>
Holder coughed.  “He touched the Third Red Book in Aisle Five.”  As this explanation was offered, Mynilar flicked a thumb across his own throat to illustrate.<br>
“Mmm, yes, yes.  And you both watched this happen?”  The two men half-shrugged.  Ernst stood up, took a few steps toward his visitors, and turned to face Holder.  “Might I ask why you did nothing to prevent this?”<br>
Holder fidgeted with his glasses.  “I was in the back, reorganizing the cookbooks.  By the time I saw him, his hand was already on the book’s spine.  What was I supposed to do?  Scream, ‘Don’t tug on that tome, it’s the trigger to a lethal deathtrap?’  Would have raised a few odd questions, don’t you think?”<br>
Ernst stared dully at Holder’s face for a few seconds, then abruptly spun to address Mynilar.  “You were supposed to be manning the front desk, were you not?  That’s in full view of Aisle Five.  What kept you quiet?”<br>
Mynilar puffed out his pasty, tattooed chest.  “If you must know, I was working on a new poem.  When complete, anyone who hears the verse read aloud will be instantly stricken dead.”<br>
Ernst raised an eyebrow.  “Does this poem have a title?” he asked, honestly curious.<br>
Mynilar grinned.  “I call it, ‘Ode to the Moss-Encrusted Thing in a Bottle That I Believe to Have Once Been a Cat.’”<br>
Ernst mused.  “It’s a good start,” he concluded.  “Well,” he sighed a moment later, “let’s go have a look at this disaster.” Mynilar stepped aside to let Ernst pass, but Holder snagged his sleeve, halting him.<br>
“Hold on a moment,” Holder said, his voice betraying rising concern.  With his free hand he pointed back at the birdcage on Ernst’s desk.  “Pardon me for asking, but is that my pet budgie in that cage?”<br>
Ernst glanced back at the tiny creature flailing about behind the bars.  “Yes, I believe so.”  He turned to leave again, but Holder tugged him back.<br>
“What are you doing to my budgie?” Holder asked.<br>
“I’m torturing it to death,” Ernst answered nonchalantly.  “A better theoretical grasp of pain thresholds will greatly improve results in my future interrogations.”  Ernst shrugged loose of Holder’s slack grip and slipped out into the hall.  Mynilar followed with a conciliatory shrug of his own.<br>
“But, but,” stammered Holder, his mouth agape.  “Why experiment on my budgie?”<br>
Ernst’s answer echoed back from the hall.  “Because your pigeons only lasted an hour.”<br>
Ernst followed the shadowy hallway out onto the creaking balcony overlooking the main room of the Vallaki Bookshop.  Dust danced in the air, captured in cold sunbeams piercing the two-story room through a pair of tall windows in the western wall.  Stuffed heads from a dozen species of local wildlife starred down from niches near the high ceiling, peeking out through the thick wooden beams supporting the oddly angled roof.<br>
Ernst placed his hands on the heavy, baroque banister and peered down at the room below.  The large chamber was divided into aisles by several rows of bookcases, each teeming with obscure tomes.  More worm-eaten books were stacked around the edges of the chamber, almost obscuring several pale and ghastly portraits of pale and ghastly people.<br>
Ernst sighed a bit as he looked down at Aisle Five in particular.  “Oh, ye gods,” he murmured.  “I can see the blood from here.”<br>
Swallowing any further signs of annoyance, Ernst walked down the steps, followed by Holder and Mynilar.  They stopped at the end of Aisle Five and stared dully at the crimson mess that dripped within.<br>
“At least the trap caught him cleanly,” offered Holder as conciliation.<br>
“Yes, right at the neck and knees,” aided Mynilar.  “Very tidy.”<br>
Ernst held his tongue as he approached the body.  After examining the pieces of the burgomeister for a moment, his eye fell upon the Third Red Book, jutting out from the shelf.  Extending a finger, he daintily pressed the book back into place.  With a click, the two scything blades stretched across the aisle slid back into their concealed slots within the thick shelves.<br>
Holder and Mynilar slipped up behind him.  “Look,” suggested Mynilar, “We have nothing to worry about.  Holder can just animate the corpse and send it on its merry way!”<br>
Ernst gave the other two a suspicious look.  “Really?  Even with his head off?”<br>
“Oh, yes, of course!” Holder blustered.  “Here, sit him up and help me stick his bits back on.”<br>
The three men pulled the headless corpse upright, leaning its back against the blood-spattered bookcase.  While Ernst cautiously balanced the burgomeister’s head upon its severed neck, Holder and Mynilar knelt to align the corpse’s shins with its knees.  Soon enough, the three men stepped back to examine their handiwork.  After a minute, Ernst glanced impatiently at Holder.<br>
“Oh, right,” Holder sputtered, crouching before the precariously balanced corpse.  Holder removed his tinted glasses, revealing eerie, inhuman eyes.  He thrust his hand just above the slain man’s face.<br>
“Arise, dead one, I demand of thee!  I call upon my dark gift!  I grant thee the life that comes after death!  Arise, and obey me!”  <br>
A chill passed through the witnesses.  After a moment, the corpse’s glassy eyes blinked open.  Mynilar and Holder sighed with relief.  Holder stared into the zombie’s eyes, pointing at one of the dead man’s boots.<br>
“Wiggle your toes, minion,” Holder ordered, his voice thick with menace.  Still moving only its eyes, the zombie looked down at its feet.  Soon enough, the indicated boot began to weakly flex.<br>
“Voilà!” exclaimed Holder, jumping to his feet.  “Mind you, he’s just a mindless undead puppet chained to my will, but we can work around that.”<br>
“Mmm, yes, yes,” intoned Ernst, unconvinced.  He knelt down at the dead man’s side.  “You there,” he barked.  “Burgomeister!  Look me in the eye.”<br>
The zombie twisted its neck to look at Ernst—and its neck kept on twisting, until the unanchored head lost its balance, tumbling free of its perch and rolling halfway down the aisle.<br>
Mynilar covered his eyes.  Holder sucked in his breath.  Ernst shook his head.  “This simply won’t do.”<br>
“What izzn’t going to do?” asked a hissing voice from above.  The three men scurried to the end of the aisle to greet the newcomer as he sauntered down the stairs from the balcony.  The man was completely swallowed by a heavy black cloak, its cowl pulled up to conceal the wearer’s face.  Only his unnaturally pale hands were visible; one held a feather duster.<br>
“Where have you been, Jaerdaph?” asked Holder.<br>
“Why?”  The cloaked newcomer studied the faces of his three compatriots.  “Whatever’zz gone wrong, it’zz nothing to do with me.  I’ve been up in the attic all day, duzzting the cobwebzz out of Ryven’s room.”<br>
Mynilar barked with laughter.  “Oh, isn’t that nice!  Did Ryven ask you to do that?  Feeling chatty, was he?”<br>
Jaerdaph’s pale lips twisted into a frown.  “Azz a matter of fact, he wazz.”  He thrust the feather duster at Mynilar angrily.  “You know, you might want to conzzider that maybe it’zz that attitude of yourzz that keepzz Ryven from warming up to you.”<br>
Mynilar grunted, crossing his arms.  “Ryven wouldn’t ‘warm up’ if I burned him at the stake.”<br>
“All right, that’s quite enough of that,” interrupted Ernst, stepping between the irate men.  Ernst turned to the spidery figure still standing at the foot of the stairs.  “Well,” explained Ernst, “it appears that these two evil geniuses have killed the burgomeister in our shop.”<br>
“That is completely unfair!” screamed Holder.<br>
“Quite right,” consoled Ernst.  “I do apologize. Jaerdaph, I should have said that these two chose to sit and watch as one of our deathtraps sliced the burgomeister into various cuts of meat.”<br>
Jaerdaph shrugged, a scowl barely visible within the his cowl.  “So what’zz the problem?” he hissed.<br>
“The problem, my dear, is that it is currently . . .”  Ernst craned his neck to look back at the hanging clock ticking near the door into the cellars.  At that very moment the clock chimed, and a stuffed crow’s head extended from the clock’s face twice in rapid succession, cawing each time.<br>
“. . . two o’clock,” Ernst concluded.  “That means we have less than four hours before the sun sets.  Do remember that this is Barovia.  If our beloved burgomeister is not hale, hearty and at home before sunset, his wife will—quite rightfully—conclude that something horrible has happened to him.”<br>
Jaerdaph scowled a bit more.  “I zztill don’t zzee the problem.  Once it getzz dark, we can go over to the burgomeizzter’zz manor and kill hizz wife.  I’ll do it myzzelf.  Problem zzolved.”<br>
“Not quite,” echoed a voice from a large grate in the floor near the front doors, flanked by the front desk and the stuffed body of a rearing creature dubiously labeled as a bear.  The four men turned to watch as a spindly arm pushed the grate open from below.<br>
The creature that emerged from the crawlspace beneath the shop floor resembled a scarecrow, its withered flesh stretched tight across its bones.<br>
“I would recommend against eliminating the burgomeister’s wife,” advised the creature.  Its voice reverberated strangely.  “She has two brothers, currently serving in the Barovian militia occupying Teufeldorf in the former Gundarak.  Although the woman has been estranged from her siblings for years, her death would assuredly prompt in them a thirst for vengeance.”<br>
“Good gracious,” sputtered Holder, staring at the creature’s bony frame.  “William, when’s the last time you ate anything?”<br>
“—So to speak,” added Ernst.<br>
The withered creature’s hand unconsciously rose to touch the dagger nestled just under its arm.  The hand bore a black ring with dull red runes, matching the dagger’s hilt.  As hand touched dagger, the runes on both ring and hilt flashed bright crimson.<br>
“I’ve been too busy to sustain myself.  Need I remind you all that our annual report has to be completed by midnight tonight?”<br>
Ernst raised an eyebrow.  “Mmm, yes, yes.  And how is the report coming?”<br>
William glared back at Ernst.  “It’s almost done.  I’m still applying the gold leaf to a few illuminations.”<br>
“Excuse me,” interrupted Mynilar, holding up his hand.  “But exactly why are you putting gold leaf on a blasted espionage report?  We’re spies, not monks!  We aren’t being graded on penmanship here!”<br>
“And for that matter,” interjected Jaerdaph, “why doezz it have to be done by midnight tonight?”<br>
William glared hatefully at the two men.  “It has to be done by midnight tonight, because that is when the messenger from Necropolis is due.”<br>
“Yes, yes,” Mynilar spat back, “but the messenger never comes, does he?  That precious report is going to sit on a shelf in the cellar, gathering dust next to last year’s report, and the report from the year before that.  The messenger isn’t coming!  He’ll never come!  Don’t any of you get it?  We’ve been abandoned in this backwater hell!”<br>
William violently snatched his dagger from its hilt and drove its blade deeply into the floor.  “And that,” William hissed, recovering his composure, “is why the annual report has to be so extravagant.  So that when the Kargat do examine our work, they will be so impressed that they will beg us to come home.”<br>
“Excuse me!” Ernst waved for attention.  “If I might bring this delightful patter back around to our current dilemma, we have a dead burgomeister—<br>
“Undead, now,” mumbled Holder.<br>
“Yes, my error.  We have an undead burgomeister cooling in Aisle Five.  And as you all have so aptly pointed out, we must solve this problem on our own.”<br>
“I zztill don’t zzee the problem,” murmured Jaerdaph.  “I zztill zzay we go kill the burgomeizzter’zz wife tonight.  Zzo what if her brotherzz come zznooping around?  We can handle adventurerzz.”<br>
Ernst frowned.  “You know, this is the burgomeister of Vallaki we’re talking about, not some random do-gooder no one will ever miss.  His death will be noticed, you understand?  Someone must have seen him come in here.  Even if we do kill his wife, this whole wretched village will still come screaming for our heads.  Do you think we’re capable of defeating several hundred angry villagers brandishing torches and pitchforks?”<br>
The others looked around at each other with emerging grins.  Eventually William spoke up.  “It would certainly be fun to try.”<br>
Ernst’s frown deepened.  “Mmm, yes, yes.  But that’s not our real problem.  Who else do you think might notice if a Barovian burgomeister gets chopped up, eh?  Who else do you think might come snooping about?  Hmm?”<br>
The others’ grins melted.  Holder grasped at the air.  “You don’t mean . . .”<br>
Now Ernst grinned.  “That’s right, Count Strahd.  This dead burgomeister will lead Strahd right to our doorstep.  And if Strahd learns that a cell of Azalin’s spies is lurking in his domain, he will personally butcher us and sell the meat at three pence to the pound!”<br>
All the blood drained from Mynilar’s face.  “We need to get out of here, now.”  He started pacing frantically, rambling to himself.  “We can flee!  We can scatter to the winds and never come back!  If we leave right now, we could be in Borca by tomorrow night!”<br>
“It’ll never work,” wailed Jaerdaph, slumping to the floor.  “If we abandon our pozzt, then it’ll be the Kargat that butcherzz uzz.”<br>
“Wait,” interrupted Holder.  “If we get butchered, does that mean we don’t get to live forever?”<br>
“Yes!” screamed the others in unison.<br>
“So I’ll have lived in this Barovian cesspool with you scum all these years for nothing?” “YES!!” screamed the chorus.<br>
Holder gulped.  “We have to do something!”<br>
“Well,” William mused, “one disaster at a time.  Whether or not we get disemboweled tomorrow, we still need to have our annual report done tonight.  If anyone needs me, I will be succumbing to madness in my work room.  When Strahd arrives to turn us inside out, let me know.”  With that William dropped his head back down into the crawlspace, pulling the heavy grate shut after him with a resounding clang.<br>
Mynilar slumped against the end of a bookcase.  “How long do you think William’s gone without feeding?” he asked the group.<br>
“Ooh,” guessed Holder, “from the looks of him I’d say nearly a week.  He must weigh under seventy pounds by now.”<br>
“Damn podlingzz,” grumbled Jaerdaph.  “You’re forgetting he hollowzz out from the inzzide too.  I bet you hizz flesh izz no thicker than a pumpkin’zz.  I’ll wager he doezzn’t weigh an ounzze over thirty poundzz.”<br>
Mynilar perked up. “I’ll take that! Say, five gold—”<br>
“Gentlemen!” shouted Ernst.  “Focus!  We are mere hours away from our doom!”<br>
Mynilar, Holder, and Jaerdaph dropped their heads.  “Sorry, Ernst, quite right.”<br>
Ernst paced around the foyer, his hands clasped around his back.  “Our dilemma is quite clear: The burgomeister is lying dead on our floor.”<br>
“—Undead!”<br>
“Mmm, yes, yes.  Right now, no one but us knows that he is dead.  This is our little secret.  So far, so good.  However, in less than four hours his wife will notice his absence.  Come the morning she will get help; some cretinous villager will say he saw the burgomeister come in here, and our little secret will be no more.”<br>
“Zzo what are we zzupposed to do?” wailed Jaerdaph.  “We can’t bring the man back to life!”<br>
“And for some reason I’m still figuring out,” added Mynilar, “we can’t just do the sensible thing and run for our miserable lives.”<br>
“Do you think his wife might notice if we just stitched his head and legs back on and sent him on his way?” asked Holder, his voice hopeful.<br>
Ernst regarded him coldly.  “He’s a mindless, shambling zombie.  That would work wonderfully if we had to replace one of you, but at very least his wife will probably notice his rapid slide to room temperature . . .”<br>
Ernst’s voice trailed off.  The room fell into an expectant silence.<br>
Suddenly, Ernst’s gaze snapped back into focus.  “I think I have a plan.”  The others leaned forward in des-peration.  “Mynilar, lock up the shop; we’re closing early.  Holder, Jaerdaph, you two start searching the stacks for books that might help us.  Drawden, you—”<br>
Ernst stopped abruptly, as did everyone else.  He spun on his heel, hastily scanning the room.  “Where in the Nine Hells is Drawden?”<br>
“I think he’zz in hizz room,” offered Jaerdaph.  “I heard him in there earlier.”<br>
Ernst rushed up the stairs, taking three steps at a time.  “You all get to work; I’ll fetch Drawden.  We’ll need him if my plan is to have any hope of success.”<br>
Ernst ran across the balcony, into the shadowed hall, and past his own room.  Just before the winding stairs up to the attic he reached Drawden’s room and kicked open the door.<br>
Drawden was inside, a pudgy, leathery man in a black, disheveled robe.  He was leaning heavily against the door of his closet, just barely keeping some hideous, shrieking thing within the closet from bursting free.  While three mottled, scarred left arms pressed out from the doorway, clutching at his torn clothes and exposed flesh, Drawden was straining with one foot to reach an enchanted scroll lying just out of reach on the floor.<br>
Ernst leaned into the room.  “Drawden, could you come downstairs?  We have a bit of an emergency.”<br>
Drawden glared at Ernst, his face red from exertion.  “I’m somewhat busy at the moment; what’s going on?”<br>
“We have a secret, and we have four hours to find a way to keep it a secret forever.”<br>
“What happens if I don’t help?”<br>
“We all get peeled like onion skins.”<br>
Drawden mumbled something under his breath.  “Very well.  I’ll be down just as soon as I’m done here.”<br>
“Mmm, yes, yes.” Ernst withdrew from the room, politely closing the door as he went.  Drawden went back to desperately reaching for the scroll with his toes.<br>
A moment later there was a knock at the door.  Drawden barked something unintelligible, and Ernst leaned back into the room.<br>
Ernst raised an eyebrow.  “Forgive me for prying, but isn’t that the Gibbering Thing you’ve got there?”<br>
Drawden nodded, swatting away one of the blindly grasping, misshapen hands.<br>
“Ah.  Very well.  Don’t let me bother you.”  Ernst closed the door again.<br>
A moment later it opened once more, and Ernst stuck his head in a third time.<br>
“What’s it doing out of the cellar?”<br>
Drawden’s voice strained from his exertion.  “Misbehaving.”<br>
Ernst’s gaze hopped idly from Drawden, to the Gibbering Thing pounding against the inside of the closet, to the scroll just beyond Drawden’s foot.  “Well,” he chimed, finally, “as I said, we need you downstairs as soon as you wrap up here.”  With that Ernst left, shutting the door behind him.<br>
Drawden sighed to himself.  “I suspect I should have just listened to my horoscope and stayed in bed.”<br>
