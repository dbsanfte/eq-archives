I tried to get intelligent responses, and maybe something other than &quot;screw you Fenye! paladins aren't useless! look at soandsouberpaladin!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Other than the few non-rectum-clenching posts, it really shows what a screwball immature crowd most of Brell is. Or at least the ones who like to post nonsense.<br>
<br>
I worked my ass off for my Valorium. It took me 56 fear raids to get all of it. It took me nearly 2 months to complete Nature's Defender. I didn't have a guild carrying me the way through that. Everything I've done, I've done for myself, and gotten myself, and only very rarely have I ever benefitted from others.<br>
My point in the original post, was that unless a paladin has the resources to become &quot;uber&quot; there is not much of a chance of him ever leaving a good impression on the group unless he/she talks alot. Even a paladin with good playing ability, and I do consider myself one of the best paladins on Brell, won't make a lasting impression on those who grouped with him/her. I've grouped with many of Brell's best paladins, and each time, I wasn't impressed by thier performance. And you people claim them to be the shining examples of this class. <br>
<br>
Paladins suck. They are fun to play until after level 50, then they just start sucking on @#%$, inch by inch.<br>
<br>
'Scuse my language. I'm a little peeved at the blatant stupidity I see in over half the posts on this thread.<br>
<br>
And to that young ranger, who thought it was funny to quote me saying something that still remains true ... 15 levels ago. Here is a little something for you.<br>
I am talking about MY game, which is in zones that depend on set group of classes. My game takes place mainly after level 55. What I said about &quot;rangers&quot; was that the stupid ones get themselves killed because they don't know a damn thing about aggro and hate lists. Seeing as how you still like to prod me on that, it seems you are definently one of the dumbasses out there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not going to take the time out to respond to each and every poster, as so rarely are the ones that are worth even wasting my time to respond.<br>
<br>
I'm saying it again, Paladins are useless. I am a paladin, better than most of them, and I know my @#%$.<br>
<br>

<br>
paladins are NOT useless. they can be some of the best tanks in the game. they have very good ac, lots of hp, and a good range of spells to help a group out. a well played pally can be one of the best additions to a group out there. <br>
and personally i think a pally/ranger combo is one of the best in the game. a well played combo like this, can be very efficient. the ranger should control their aggro to keepp the mob on the pally so the pally can absorb the majority of the dmg while the ranger deals out the majority of dmg. the cleric keeps a casual eye on the ranger to keep them alive (but shouldnt need heals if they do their own job correctly) and focuses on the pally. <br>
<br>
i personally LIKE pallys. i think they are great. so you dont do as much dmg as a ranger/monk/rogue, so what? you arent meant to. and so you dont have quite the same hp or ac of a warrior, again you werent meant to. <br>
<br>
pallys/rangers/shadowknights  are hybrids and sacrifice ac/hp for their spells. pallys have GREAT gruop helpful buffs, and are the best healers (outside your primary healers) there is nothing wrong with hybrids and i think more ppl should realize this, but any class can be good or bad, it all depends on the player.<br>
<br>
lots of ppl have said various things on this thread, and i dont believe most of them have tried to insult you Fenye. you made a post saying pallys suck, and they cant find gruops. they were either arguing your points (defending them or disagreeing with them) or trying to offer solutions as to how YOU can be happier playing your pally. <br>
<br>
i personally think yu play your pally very well and i am always confident and feel safe in a gruop with you in it. and although i hope you take this post with a grain of salt and realize it for what it is, an attempt to help you; i think you may not like it and get angry with me. i hope you dont and i hope you want to play your pally again like you once did. <br>
<br>
anyway, just my 2cp on pallys in general.<br>
<br>

But a paladin can still be a good asset(sp) to a group or raid. In a group situation Hwedung is prolly the best paladin i've grouped with, he's way of playing the class makes it very very usefull, he is one of the few tanks that taunt away from me 99% of the time in a standard xp group and saves the cleric alot of mana. <br>
Paladins still have a place, its just not what it used to be, just like rangers and necros, hell even wizards imo.<br>
<br>
If you dont wanna adjust quit or make a new char, i did, some of my friends stuck it out and all seem happy about their classes now. Its a matter of being willing to accept a rolechange really.<br>

On a side note, i dont think hwedung has super uber king of the hill yada yada gear, he just plays great. Of course he does mez a couple mobs each fight with his manboobs... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrimmxwork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmxwork</A> at: 5/23/01 2:09:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Queen of Discord</span><br>  Posts: 1848<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/23/01 2:14:52 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://people.mn.mediaone.net/timelord81/images/fenye.jpg hieght=285 width=129></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> you actually wish you had MORE hp/ac? you already have the same ac as I do, maybe 30 less, and only a few hp less than I do.<br>
<br>
I am not arguing that paladins are inferior to warriors. That was not my point. I am arguing that paladins are the least wanted class in a group. <br>
<br>
Several people I know of, exclude paladins from thier groups, refuse to group with them because they see how much paladins suck.<br>
<br>
As for our group &quot;friendly&quot; spells. Ok, here we go.<br>
<br>
Wave of Healing. Costs 450mana for a 250hp heal to all group members. This costs me a bub of mana, so I can use it 5 times. Most paladins do not have the high wis I do, and can only cast it 3-4 times, if that. The spell also has a 2 4minute recast time. It's not very useful, unless you want to top off heals.<br>
<br>
Divine Favor. One second casting time, is a 200hp rune type spell with a 9minute recast time. It's OK for buying the cleric a few hits (like 2) to get off his CH on the tank, or to try to save the chanter so you can have another few seconds to stun the aggroed mob. but pretty much a useless spell.<br>
<br>
Divine Glory/Strength. Probably our best group affiliated spells. Adds 100 or 200hp to the target, stacks with all spells BUT STR of Nature, and that spell is FAR superior than Divine Glory/Strength. A measly 100-200hp is not as effective to melee as STR of Nature, and only casters like the additional hp. Not exactly a great spell, but is cheap on mana if you dont mind it taking up the buff slot.<br>
<br>
I'm not disillusioned, I'm going with the flow of most of the people I meet. It's VERY hard getting onto a raid. Paladins are useless against VS. We dont' get to fight until the warrior does his/her thing. We are only used as pull lambs for Trak. Raids do not need paladins.<br>
<br>
As far as finding groups, anytime a warrior is LFG, he will get taken before me, and with the vast number of tanks out there, it's very hard to find a group as a paladin.<br>
<br>
<br>
So what good are we? why not get a ranger to take the place of a paladin? they have almost as many hp, and they can get thier ac up to that of a paladin. They have higher defensive skills (dodge, parry, riposte, etc). <br>
Clerics and enchanters can stun, and do so quite often.<br>
<br>
Again, paladins are useless, and I would love to see some upgrades. I can't stand how often I miss my attacker, it just makes me feel like a newbie trying to hit a blue con mob.<br>
<br>
I've tried to quit, but can't. I've tried to join a guild that would offer me a chance to explore the game from a different perspective. I've tried to gather as many friends possible to try to get groups going, but they are all too busy for me.<br>
<br>
Until I accomplish some of those things, this game is going to be very boring for this old paladin.<br>
<br>
Oh, and thank you Tanari for pointing out how &quot;disillusioned&quot; I am. I'm not a psycho, nor a paranoid freak, nor some schizo.<br>

Objective discussion is always welcome.  I think everyone realizes that every class has its strengths and weaknesses.  Feel free to point these out in a civil manner.<br>
<br>
I, for one, feel that if you no longer feel you can play your character to its full potential, then it's time to back away for a while.  Go play another class...then you might see that you really do have a great character after all.<br>
<br>
That being said...PLEASE WATCH THE FOUL LANGUAGE and snitty remarks.  We'll see how things go...  But feel free to contribute.<br>

For instance:<br>
My first rogue was a human, i couldn't melee for beans, so i deleted her, MONTHS later, i make a GNOME rogue and do something i've only done with my monk, cleric, warrior, and necro, i got to level 5 in one night of playing, i had FUN, i ENJOYED this character, and i still do.<br>
My point is, if you don't like how your class is at getting groups, try different combos, if you like SKs, don't post &quot;which is better?&quot; PLAY and experiment for yourself, don't rely on the opinions of others, the challenge of different race/class combos is half the fun! <p><img src="http://members.home.net/cgoebel5/sig/Yshaasig.jpg"><br>Yshaa Suppaheala<br>

<br>
1. I make myself useless.  Ive been guilty of doing this a lot lately <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I say &quot;oh were useless&quot; and whine and dont back the group up with heals, buffs, dont stun, etc.  Maybe you should ask yourself if you could be doing more.  Ive asked myself that a lot recently and found the answer was yes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
2. I read &quot;Paladins are Useless&quot; posts and actually beleive them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. I get in a group which just doesnt appreaciate what a Paladin has to offer, such as one having a cleric who insists on doing all the buffing and downtime healing, basicaaly increasing the downtime for the group because he/she is always out of mana or where the person you just used Lay Hands on thanks the druid LOL for that quick heal which saved his ass (yes its happened to me in groups before).<br>
<br>
 <br>
While were not the most powerful class out there nor the most in-demand (name me one class other than enchanters and clerics that you can say are really in high demand in a group)  were really not in that bad a shape overall  <p>Brimhoff

One of the biggest character flaws I have is a tornado temper. Even when people disagree with me, I tend to take them as insults and throw my fury at them. Usually though, I cool down a bit and bite my lip. It's something I've been working on controlling for a long time now, and I pretty much had it under control, but these last few weeks have really taken thier toll on me.<br>
<br>
First off, I was feeling pretty down, because I had a huge fight with my best friend, and we have been very angry at each other for almost a month now. It's really hard seeing your best friend and not being able to talk to them because you are so angry that you know if you do, it'll just end up in another fight.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the game itself hasn't been treating me all that well. I *still* haven't found any hopeful responses from people to join a guild, and that is something I really want. I think that if I do in fact join a guild, I'll have access to alot of people, and will be able to form up groups alot easier. I don't enjoy sitting around on my butt all day, but I'd really like to get in a guild and start doing things for myself and for others. I believe that once I do, my enjoyment of the game will increase tenfold, and I'll be alot happier.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I had a very very bad night during that weekend. I was invited to go to a raid (this does NOT happen very often, like once every few months), so I eagerly agreed to go. I was working nightshifts, so when I got off work, instead of catching a few hours of sleep, I played Everquest, and got to level 58, then went on the raid. I arrived at the meeting point, but died, and lost level 58 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I couldn't find anyone to give me directions to the zone where we would raid in, so that was scary running around in a foriegn zone to me not knowing where to go. When I finally did arrive, I fell asleep an hour into the raid, and died. I awoke hours later, to find out my rez timer had expired, and I had a whole nother half bubble to go to regain level 58 again. It was hard to take for me, because I don't find good groups very often, and xp is alot harder for me to gain than most people.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I was hating my class a bit, but most of it is probably my own fault. <br>
<br>
If I didn't have this stupid temper problem, I would already be in a nice guild, with more than a handful of friends, and I wouldn't have such a hard time having a good time.<br>
<br>
Paladins aren't that useless, they just aren't respected enough to get the reputation they deserve. I know I play my paladin very well, but when I'm feeling down like this, I really am useless. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry for the outburst, believe me, I'm really trying hard to control my temper. It's just sometimes all the bad things happen at once to me and it's a little hard to take and still keep a straight face. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
My apologies, I hope not too many people hate me for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uselilya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>selilya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Board Moderator<br><font color=#A0B0E0>&lt;Violent Harvest&gt;  </font></span><br>  Posts: 483<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/25/01 7:04:14 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/selilya/sel_head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> Fenye,<br>

<br>
I can go with Deepwater, but lose a lot of stats. I have a horrendously low str (as a high elf), and taking off my valorium for Deepwater would lower it below 100 almost. Deepwater also has rediculous effects, none that I would ever bother using. Soothe (arms) endure magic (boots) daring (helm), stun (bracer), cancel magic (gloves) symbol of pinzarn (bp) and spirit str (legs). The bp is nice, and I would upgrade to that, but it's hard to get. The legs would be the most useful, but those are hard to get, too.<br>
Anything else is just lame.<br>
<br>
The ac would be nice.. but I really need to keep my stats up. Not to mention the vast mana loss I would take.<br>
<br>
The other armor, as such in velious, is very nice. But to get that, I have to do quests, and I need to go on raids and such to collect hte peices and gems. That isn't too hard, but I'm guildless, and doing those types of things are very hard to get into if you aren't guildless or hella popular.<br>
<br>
It's just alot of bad things all tie together to prevent me from doing certain things and advancing further. <br>
