What about compromise?<br>
<br>
What about sharing?<br>
<br>
What about saying, I know I want this my way, and you want it your way, what about meeting halfway?<br>
<br>
For example, why isn't Toril's idea or Adun's plan concerning the FG's in consideration? Instead we are faced with only a YES, NO vote <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What about common ground?<br>
<br>
Why force the issue? All or nothing? <br>
<br>
What is this, it's got to be my way stuff?<br>
<br>
The majority of us are mature people (not necessarily including myself), and we are and should be above such pettiness.<br>
<br>
Please reconsider this situation, not just because of the FG's themselves (which I will probably never raid myself anyway), but because it is setting the tone for how we as a community will resolve issues in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvumil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vumil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Lich [Admin]</span><br>  Posts: 1145<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 5:01:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What about Compromise?</span><hr size=1> We tried to compromised and meet 1/2 way for 6 MONTHS and now that it looks like certain people are going to get there way, the other side wants to compromise?

Why?  Quite simple really. People tend to preserve the status quo in any political situation. Options C and D would only serve to fragment the &quot;No&quot; vote. Seen it done a million times in politics. If a certain candiate is radical but popular, put a few more candidates with similiar but less/more radical views in opposition and watch the votes slide away. Ralph Nader in Florida, Ross Perot vs. Bush, etc.<br>
<br>
The only way what you are thinking could have worked is in a binding referendum fashion.  Could have positioned it like this.<br>
<br>
Do you think the Fire Giant reservation status should remain the same or be changed in some fashion? (Yes/No)<br>
<br>
If you vote &quot;No&quot; the current system will remain in place.  If you vote &quot;Yes&quot; a second vote would be held with the following options available: 1) Eliminate the reservation status, 2) X's plan for FG reservations, 3) Y's plan for reservations, etc.<br>
<br>
So if the &quot;Yes&quot; vote carried in the first election, change would be assured.  The only question then would be what form it would take. This may have worked. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uletholasforestheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Letholas Forestheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 7:52:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: In order for Compromise to work</span><hr size=1> Kulanae, I certainly never considered the political ramification you are speaking of.<br>

<br>
The vote is between people who want some reservation to continue and those who dont. If yes wins, someone can propose something other than total elmination and that will be voted on. <br>
<br>
However if there's anything that voting on this board has demonstrated its that people are incapable of following instructions (i.e. dont comment on your vote, just say yes or no). If we had multiple choices it would be like handing the old folks in Palm Beach a butterfly ballot. Their blue hair would burst into flames and they'd all vote for Jerry Falwell as a write in candidate by mistake. <br>

I have to disagree with you here:<br>

&quot;The vote is between people who want some reservation to continue and those who dont. If yes wins, someone can propose something other than total elmination and that will be voted on. &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes is for reservations remaining EXACTLY the same. The quote from the voting thread follows.<br>
<br>
I once more mention that I myself would have voted otherwise, and I believe Adun also would have, just from casual observation. And that's one from each side.<br>

&quot;IF YOU VOTE &quot;YES&quot;: The fire giants in Solusek B will CONTINUE to be reservable, without exception, under the rules listed in the Nagafen/Fire Giants forum. <br>

You're wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm voting to keep the FG reservation.  I prefer it, currently, to the offered alternative (FCFS).<br>
<br>
Had the vote been tendered as Letholas mentioned I'd have voted FOR change... <br>
<br>
There are also a number of parties voting Yes/No on the vote with &quot;great thought&quot; or &quot;great concern&quot; listed.  In other words... there appears to have been a middle ground of some size... enough to change the outcome had it been done differently, maybe...<br>
<br>
But... we'll never no.<br>
<br>
Yes or No aren't always the best choices... sometimes the answers are inbetween.<br>

And yes there's a middle ground, which was my point in the post. You make one simple vote to see if this proposal passes. If it doesn't you post a vote on a lesser change, and so forth. Eventually you come to something that passes, or you are left with the original system.
