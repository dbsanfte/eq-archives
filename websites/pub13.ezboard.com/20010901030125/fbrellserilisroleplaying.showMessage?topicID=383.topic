Minz sat against the hull of the boat. Blind eyes staring into nothingness. The breeze was cool and comfortable after the long treck through the Butcher Block mountains. The journey had worn on him, and he leaned back relaxing for the first time in a long while. His mind teetering between wakefulness and sleep. Dreams weaving into reality and back into dreams. 'Is it right?' he though. 'Is it right that I can justify the murder of one to save another?' Sleep slowly pulled him under. 'Or is it vanity that one can think such vile actions have pure motive. The hubris of man, weighing the life of one against that of another.'<br>
<br>
He was standing now. Staring out across a vast ocean. The blue water all about him, and not another soul to be seen. He rested his hand on the gunnel. The wood was slimy and it crumbled in his grasp. The ship all about him changed. It rotted and crumbled before his very eyes. Foul stinking planks held together by rusted nails and broken pegs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like a dead and decaying ship,&quot; a voice said aloud. &quot;Driven by the white breezes of the north.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does the sweet breeze that pushes this ship make its journey beautiful and righteous?&quot; he asked the voice. &quot;Or does the simple black nature of the vessel make it to dark to for any purpose to make right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz looked to the heavens for an answer, but all he saw where the ships masts, tipped poison dragging an infected, seeping gash across the sky. The ship's sails unfurled. A death shrouds for its one passenger.<br>
<br>
The bell tolled out the hours.<br>
<br>
Charon was at the helm. His tattered cassock hanging low over his dead eyes.<br>
<br>
A pile of gold coins sat at his feet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is the journey vile no matter what wind drives it?&quot; He asked the silent helmsman. Charon motioned to the cabin. His hand sweeping back in a sickeningly slow gesture.<br>
<br>
Minz ventured into the depths of the ship. Deeper and deeper he marched. The stairs descended far below the waterline of the ship's hull. The deeper he went, the more solid the timbers became. &quot;And what's this?&quot; He shouted. His voice echoed up the long stairwell. &quot;The wood at the ships center is solid? Is it hard because it is undecayed? Or is it worse than the rest? Incorruptible because it is already corrupted?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where can such a deathly ferry take one but down to the bottom of the ocean.&quot; The voice answered. &quot;But to the foulest depths where the water's pressure crushes out all that is unnecessary. Leaving the essential core.<br>
<br>
&quot;The heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;The pebble that rests at the center each of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz held the amulet in his hand. The hard black stone embedded within it glimmered in the light.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where will I go from here?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
An ocean appeared before him. Its waters were dark and turbulent.<br>
<br>
Across the distance he saw them, his friends. He reached out, leaning over the water, needing them now more than ever. Yet with each breath of wind into the sails, they sunk further beneath the horizon.<br>
<br>
&quot;How will I reach across the vast sea that I have put between myself and those I care for?&quot; He asked. &quot;The deed I have pledged to complete for their sake sends me further and further away. Though they would abhor it, it must be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
The brackish waters turned crimson. A red tide pushing the ship father and father around the curve of the earth. Until the visage of those loved was gone.<br>
<br>
'All I can see is not that which I had faced,' he mused ironically. 'Not the clean and lovely ones called friends, but the fetid enemy that I run from. That I am becoming.'<br>
<br>
A mast stabbed up over the horizon. Another black ship making passage across this empty sea. A lone passenger stared across the gunnel at Minz. His hollow eyes sunken deep into the recesses of his face. Blue skin taught with hatred and deceit.<br>
<br>
'The reflection at the edge of the earth is me,' he thought, recognizing the form as himself. 'And it is a black black thing I do.'<br>
<br>
The sound of the harbor bell brought him out of his slumber. &quot;All ashore that's goin ashore,&quot; the first mate called out. Minz rose from his spot. Stretching sore muscles that ached from being prone in one position for too long. He rested his hand on the gunnel of the ship. Pausing a moment to feel its solidity. And then walked toward the gangway, feeling his way to the dock, by holding his hand on the gunnel as he walked, and then the rope of the gangway as he crossed onto the docks of Freeport.<br>
<br>
One step closer to his mark.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
The land slipped by in blurred images. Some on the most beautiful scenery in the world, faded into the background. Even the Karanas slipped by unnoticed. The land he knew so well, places where he used to play, the ol' swimmin hole, the family's farm, not even an after thought. He was preparing for a job. Nothing else mattered.<br>
<br>
Much of the trip he was able to make in Tier Dal form. Though he had become quite proficient at traveling blind, sight speeded up the trip immensely. Throughout the journey he reviewed all he knew of his target: Kassy Lightborn.<br>
<br>
'Wood elf by birth. Now some how a Tier Dal.' He chuckled ruefully at the irony. 'She was perhaps one of the few people in the world who could understand what he was going through. And he was going to kill her . . . An enchantress by art. . . Smart and cunning . . . but I should be able to get close enough. Lives in Qeynos alone. . . Accepted by the community. . . Well like by all accounts. . . She will not suspect me so long as I am a half elf. . . ' For most jobs he would spend a day or two watching his mark, getting to know them. But he knew this one very well already.<br>
<br>
She was a friend to the Dragons and a friend to him.<br>
<br>
But that was all over now.<br>
<br>
He held her face in his mind for a moment, studying the features. Following the lines of her neck in his mind's eye. It was thin, almost frail. He envisioned his blade sliding across her throat, the skin peeling open as the keen edge passed over her blue skin, noting the three, or four actually, important vessels to be cut: the carotid arteries, the trachea and jugular vein.<br>
<br>
If one successfully opened all of these vessels the likelihood of survival was close to nil. Within 5 minutes, over half of the body's blood drained out, air ceases being delivered to the brain, and the lungs fill with enough blood to drown the victim. Additionally, slitting the throat lessened the likelihood of the victim crying out. This could also be achieved by plunging a blade between the fifth and sixth ribs and into the right lung. But the likelihood of a quick death was better with the throat. The downside to this attack was that the poison is often not absorbed sufficiently. A direct stab to the heart or lungs was much more efficient in this regard.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, a slit thought was the way to do it. One second . . . two tops. That was all it took. And her life would be ended. Ohh she wouldn't die that quickly, but her life would be done. He thought back to his teacher, Cerawyn, and to their practice sessions late at night in Freeport. &quot;Not like that boy!&quot; he'd say. Chastising Minz for making a sweeping curved slice across some whore's throat. &quot;Don't get all artsy fartsy on me, makin some smiley face on their neck! Like this!&quot; he would grab the now dead body by the hair, lifting her dead form and slit her throat again. &quot;One. Two. Straight down, pivot and straight up. That's all.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later, Cer had taught him about the anatomy of the body; where the critical veins and arteries were and how their locations varied slightly depending on the race. It was a hell of a lot more book learning that he had ever anticipated.<br>
<br>
The first guard tower of Qeynos could be seen in the distance. He stopped well out of sight, most Tier Dal were not welcome here. Opening his shirt, he ran his fingers over the living amulet. It was natural now, like it was a part of him. Despite the constant wound it created, he drew comfort and strength from it. It was hard to describe, there was little middle ground any more. It was either right or wrong. Friend or enemy.<br>
<br>
He slipped a finger underneath the spider. It wriggled in protest, but didn't resist as it had earlier. They were coming to know one another. He pulled gently, and the amulet came free. Its needle like legs slipping out of their sanguine moorings. The world went black. Skin stretched and tingled. A vague shifting in his belly and it was done. He could have kept walking throughout the process if he wanted too. Not that the change had become any less painful, he had simply become used to it. The wound on his chest had become a permanent gash. Constantly seeping blood no matter what body he was in. Blood now covered the front third of his shirt. But the black scaled armor he wore covered most of the gore.<br>
<br>
The path to the city was paved with rough flagstones. This made it easy to follow, but hard to walk. He was constantly tripping on the rough and uneven joints of the stones. Several times he ended up flat on his face. But soon enough he was at the gates of the city. Qeynos was just as he remembered it, except that he couldn't see it. Tubal Weaver haggled over prices with his customers. The guards extorted platinum wherever they could. The smells of the merchant stalls wafted through the city.<br>
<br>
His first stop was the Crow tavern, and the rogue's guild hidden within. Minz laughed to himself as he rounded the corner to the bar. As a child, he'd boasted that he could find his way through Qeynos blind. Today he was proving himself right, deftly walking through the wide avenues and tight alleys, never missing a step. Using his childhood memories and the constant echoes of his harpoon rapping the ground.<br>
<br>
It was customary for a rogue on a job to pay a &quot;courtesy call&quot; on the rogue guildmaster when on contract in a foreign town. The mark's name and the assassin were recorded, and clearance is given. Not that contracts weren't completed without the guild's blessing. Happened all the time. But the courtesy call ensured the assassin was up to date on local conditions and prevented two rogues from going after the same mark. The guild would also provided assistance in exiting the city and independent confirmation that the job was completed.<br>
<br>
Guildmaster Hanns Kreighor questioned him in his usual direct manner. &quot;Name o' the mark?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy Lightborn.&quot; Minz replied. The faint scratch of a quill could be heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Contractor?&quot;Hanns said flatly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Undisclosed.&quot; was his reply. More scribbling.<br>
<br>
&quot;Contracted?&quot; Hanns said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz Elandril.&quot;<br>
<br>
A silent pause, the tiny clink of a quill dipped into an inkbottle followed by more scribbling. &quot;Right. You're all set.&quot; Hanns said, rolling the blotter across the page and closing the book with a thwump. &quot;Luck in the shadows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Luck in the shadows.&quot; Minz responded to the familiar rogue salutation.<br>
<br>
He left the guild, and headed back to the bar above. The echoing drip of the aqueducts could be heard in the background. He rounded the corner and walked up the stairs. Slipping through the illusionary wall. A tingle on his skin told him that he was passing through the magic. Generally, rogues shunned magic, and Hanns' near phobia for it was common knowledge among the rogue community. But he had obviously made a compromise here.<br>
<br>
Kassy lived on the residential west side of town. 'No sense in hiding. Hell, she'll probably invite me in!&quot; Minz smiled crookedly to himself as he started off toward her house. The west side of Qeynos was a quiet and intimate place. Avenues narrow to slim paths. Scowling business like faces give way to friendly glances. Pleasantries were commonly exchanged between strangers and even the stiff, tight posture of the guards seemed to soften.<br>
<br>
The smell of baking bread wafted through the air. Bringing thoughts of home bubbling to the surface of Minz's mind. It was a clear spring day he remembered. Puffy clouds drifted by slowly. He and his brother were playing in the field next to the house. Climbing the large tree that dominated the otherwise open space.<br>
<br>
Minz was laughing at his brother, who hung upside down, his arms dangling, face becoming bright red as the blood rushed to his head.<br>
<br>
Mom was cooking dinner: beef stew with carrots and potatoes and fresh bread to mop up every last bit from the bowl. 'Yum!' They'd already been tossed out of the kitchen once for pestering mom, and were now fighting the siren's call of her cooking again. He smiled<br>
<br>
The rock jutted out of the flagstone walk, making a rough 2-inch ledge in the otherwise smooth surface of the path. It was perfectly visible, and easily avoidable. But vision was a luxury for Minz now. And the price of that luxury was an almost universal hatred by all those who walked the earth.<br>
<br>
His toes hit the rock hard, sending the rogue stumbling forward, letting go of his harpoon and thrusting his arms out in an attempt to catch hold of something, anything to avoid another painful fall. Large hands grasped him, slipping under his arms, effortlessly bringing his tumble to an end. Minz's hands instinctively locked onto the extended thick forearms of the stranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Easy boy,&quot; his savior said the deep rumbling voice of a Northman. Minz stood there for a moment, catching his breath and trying to regain his barings. &quot;Ya alright?&quot; He asked as he righted Minz.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, I'm fine,&quot; he said, releasing his clamped fingers from the barbarian's arms. The hulking man had the pungent smell of a barbarian too. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said, giving his best self-effacing grin.<br>
<br>
The Northman was still a moment, gauging Minz. The quiet sounds of the neighborhood filtered back into Minz's ears. 'Probably noticing I'm blind,' Minz thought. He heard the big man move a bit, and the clank of hardened wood on stone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here ya be,&quot; the Northman said. Minz reached out and felt the shaft of his harpoon placed in his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks again,&quot; Minz said as a Qeynos guard marched by.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do ya know where you're headin friend?&quot; The barbarian asked in a amicable voice. &quot;Perhaps I can help ya find it?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm alright,&quot; Minz replied smiling. &quot;It's just up the lane a bit. Thank you again. Safe travels to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And to you friend,&quot; the barbarian replied.<br>
<br>
Minz rapped his harpoon on the stone, listening to the echoes carefully as he started on his way.<br>
<br>
Kassy's flat actually was just a bit down the lane, but Minz purposefully walked right by it, turning down the next alley. Pressing his back to the wall. Making damn sure his barbarian friend had plenty of time to leave the vicinity.<br>
<br>
Minz waited about 15 or 20 minutes, listening for a pause in the traffic. Once the avenue was empty, he emerged from the alley. Rapping his harpoon on the stone and taking several quick steps to Kassy's door. He steeled himself inwardly, but lightly touched the feelings of friendship and affection he felt for her. She had to be at ease with him. To face her when she was readied for battle was suicide. To succeed, Minz had to strike when her guard was down.<br>
<br>
He closed his eyes unconsciously, sending the assassin in him to a dark corner in his mind. He knocked on the door.<br>
<br>
A moment passed.<br>
<br>
The click of the latch turning fell lightly on his ear.<br>
<br>
He opened his eyes and smiled as best as he cold. He was Minz Elandril, here visiting a dear friend. There was an uncomfortable pause. This was not the greeting he expected, and it sent butterflies into his stomach. &quot;Kassy?... I... Can I come in?&quot; She muttered &quot;yes&quot;, and he stepped through the door, bumping into something and almost ending up flat on his face.<br>
<br>
She seemed to grasp the his predicament, yet remainescilent, leadin him into her flat. Minz thumped his harpoon. The room they were in was wide. It likely took up the entire flat. The echoes were softened some what, and the air had the bitter green smell of a Faydwer forest. They walked slowly around the room, stopping some fifteen steps from the door. &quot;Sit here. There is a chair is right behind you,&quot; she said. Minz felt a gentle tug on his harpoon, and reluctantly let it be taken from his hand as he sat down. The chair was wide and comfortable, covered in an earthy woven fabric Minz recognized as being native to Faydwer.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blind? By the gods!&quot; She cried as Minz finally said it out loud. &quot;How. . . ? When?&quot; She clasped his shoulders, pulling him into a tight hug. &quot;Oh Minz. . . can it . . . have the healers seen you? I have friends who can. . .&quot; He wrapped his arms around her. Somewhat taken aback by her affection but touched nonetheless. Squeezing her slender frame once and pushing her away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;I have seen many who have tried. I am blind.&quot; Finality hung in his voice. She let a hand slip from his shoulder, sliding down his arm, clasping soft delicate fingers over his hand. Clenching his jaw, he pushed down a pang of guilt as it welled up in his throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be right back,&quot; she said. He heard Kassy's light steps pad away, a door swung open on well oiled hinges, the soft pop of a bottle being uncorked. She had such light steps that Minz, even paying close attention, had trouble hearing her return. When her fingers touched his hand, raising it to press a glass into it, it sent a chill shock through his body. His surprise must have been visible, because she immediately began to gush apologies. &quot;Oh Minz! I am so sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you. I just. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
He cut her off mid sentence. &quot;Hush. It's ok. You're fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhhh Minz. I just . . . just can't believe it,&quot; she said. &quot;Tell me what happened. How did you lose your sight? When? Who have you seen to remedy it and what have they tried to?&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz retold the story, of hunting with Jez in Oasis and becoming lost in the desert. How he awoke in the care of Sylavn and Jing, unable to see a thing. Of his travels to Odus and the surgery he under went, leaving out the rather distasteful details of course. Of reuniting with the Dragons and Tryllium's diagnosis.<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz! There has to be some thing we can do,&quot; she said. &quot;Let me call on my friend. She is wise in the ways of healing. One of the wisest in the land. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy!&quot; He said. &quot; Please, let it be.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed heavily. &quot; Can I get you something? Somthing to eat perhaps? You look exhausted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;More than you know, Kass. More than you know. Now what was th. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
But it was Kassy's turn to interrupt him. &quot;Right!&quot; she said. &quot;It's into bed with you.&quot; Her small hands encircled his wrist. &quot;News can wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But . . . But. . .&quot; he sputtered.<br>
<br>
&quot;No buts mister, now come on.&quot; she said, hauling him toward the back of the house.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Kass. . . &quot; He protested. &quot;I mean its not like I mind you dragging me into your bedroom. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dream on lover,&quot; she replied as she pushed him backward on to the bed.<br>
<br>
Minz spread his arms wide, a wry grin on his face. Kassy tugged at his boots, wrenching them off his feet. &quot;Will you still respect me in the morning?&quot; He said, barely able to contain his laughter. Kassy groaned as she headed for the door. &quot;Be gentle with me,&quot; he said, giggling merrily, as the door slammed shut.<br>
<br>
The giggling dribbled out of him. Ending softly, like the last drop of a rain seeping into the earth. The room was silent. Curtains rustled softly in the afternoon breeze. The sounds of the city floated in and Kassy's soft steps were barely audible in the background.<br>
<br>
He waited for a good while to pass, slowly letting go of that part of him that held Kassy dear. Bit by bit he chipped away at the feelings, consciously dismissing each pang of guilt and remorse as it surfaced. 'What the Brell?' he asked himself. 'What are you doing here?' 'What has to be done,' came the cold retort in a voice not quite his own. 'But Kassy is a friend?' He silently pleaded. 'Its Kassy or Silverstarr. One of them will die. Its up to you to decide.'<br>
<br>
Minz sighed heavily. It had been so easy once. So wonderful to be who he was: a thief and a young member of a respected guild. But now. . . Now he was the leader of that guild, responsible for the well being of its members. And one of them was in mortal danger now. Silverstarr, one of the youngest members of his guild, was held hostage. And the price of her freedom was the death of Kassy Lightborn. &quot;So be it,&quot; he said aloud. He reached into his pocket, wrapping his hand around the now familiar amulet, running his fingers over the spindly legs and smooth stone embedded in its abdomin. With his free hand, the thief pulled his shirt open at the collar bringing his other hand up and resting the spider amulet on the seeping wound in his chest. As soon as it touched his skin, it came to life, wriggling itself into his flesh.<br>
<br>
The changes washed over him. Light flooded into his eyes, and he was drow. Some how the reservations he had earlier seemed trivial. He was here to do a job. That was all that was important. The room was small. Light earthy colored walls. Lush green plants decorated the room. The door was narrower than normal. He crept to the door, leaving his shoes behind for the added silence of bare feet, inspecting the hardware. Its brass hinges showed a bit of wear, potentially creaky. Minz retrieved an oilcloth from a pocket and rubbed it over the hinges.<br>
<br>
The door opened silently. A soft breath of air puffed through the door. Minz froze. Kassy was no fool. She was experienced in battle. Though her skills were of a different nature, her senses were keen. The slightest mistake could tip her off, spelling certain death for him.<br>
<br>
The room was rectangular, yet the arrangement of plants and furniture gave it the appearance of being an oval. Clearly reminiscent of the homes of the wood elves of Kelethin. Kassy sat at a desk facing one of the longer the wall. The door he came out of was at the far end of the oval. He could see her profile clearly, her eyes intently studying a small book. Random papers and other books were strewn about the desk. A stark contrast to the clean orderly appearance of the rest of the room.<br>
<br>
Minz silently crept around her, his eyes locked on her. She muttered quietly as she read, scribbling on a notes long sheaf of paper. Occasionally reaching to her necklace, clasping a silver charm in her hand. He took his steps sideways, always keeping Kassy directly in front of him.<br>
<br>
Three more steps and he would be in position.<br>
<br>
Two steps. He was directly behind her. He drew his dagger from its sheath.<br>
<br>
One step. The scent of the dracnid poison filled his nostrils.<br>
<br>
He was behind her, reaching out to grab her head, dagger held with its blade ready to slice into her blue skin.<br>
<br>
Her head shot up.<br>
<br>
She spun with a quickness he'd not expected, shooting to her feet, gasping at his sight. Their eyes locked. Minz felt his heart jump into his throat. Not for fear, though fear clenched his gut, but in guilt. This wasn't some anonymus mark. This was Kassy.<br>
<br>
His hand shot out like an arrow seeking its target. Piercing her chest, sinking deeply into her heart.<br>
<br>
Her mouth dropped open in a gasp. Eyes wide with horror. Minz grinned at her, pushing her down on the desk with his dagger, arching her back and pinning her to the sold wood of her desk. Blood spurted over his hand in weak pulses. He leaned over her, still pressing her to the desk with his blade. His heart pounded in his chest. Sickening fear, guilt and exhilaration washed over him, yet some how compelled to revel in it. Brushing his lips to her, wanting to breathe in her last breath. Her eyes were wide with agony, and he stared into them for what seemed an eternity. Slowly, her body slid to the floor. Minz cradled her with his free arm, lowering her gently to the well worn planks of her home. Kassy's eyelids began to flutter. Minz twisted the blade hard, and they shot back open, she grasped his chest, slender fingers clenching what ever they could find.<br>
<br>
He jerked the blade out of her chest. She flinched, jerking her arms to her chest and crying out softly. There was a tugging, ripping sensation in his chest, but he ignored it, caught up in the ecstasy of Kassy's death. And then everything went black.<br>

<br>
There was a quiet knock at the door. Kassy cursed under her breath as she rose from her desk, laying aside both the small leather-bound book she was reading and her mithril-tipped quill. She had informed her numerous friends, as well as the boys who normally delivered her groceries, that she was going to be busy with delicate arcane research and was not to be disturbed. Only Xareth's messenger, who came every second day to carry away her translations of the book's contents, had seen the interior of the house within the past week. Yet there was knocking at her door.<br>
<br>
The irritated look vanished from the elf's face as she opened the door to find Minz Elandril on her front stoop. It was not only the fact that it was Minz that banished her irritation, however, but that she sensed there was something terribly wrong but couldnt put her finger on it. The rogue was ashen and looked on the verge of trembling. His atire was travel worn, nearly unheard of as the half-elf was very nearly a perfectionest. He seemed to be looking past her and she looked him in the face, trying to discover why he avoided her gaze. Then, looking into his eyes, she realized that the half-elf's were pale green when they should have been deepest brown!<br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy... I... Can I come in?&quot; He sounded unsure of himself, nervus. The enchantress mumbled a confused yes and stepped aside to allow him to enter her home. As Minz passed her he stumbled over a potted fern in the entryway. The plant was nearly three feet tall and in plain sight. Kassy gasped; Minz was blind. The next few moments were hectic. Kassy leading the sightless rogue to the over-stuffed chair in the corner of her front room, fretting over him, asking question after question, assuring him that she would do whatever was in his power to help him regain his sight, and not leaving his side. This only upset Minz all the more. He cringed away from her touch as though it burned him, finally silencing the young Tier'Dal with a harsh look from his sightless green orbs. After several moments of polite pleasentries Kassy commented on the bags beneath her friend's eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look exhausted, Minz,&quot; she said. With a few muttered protests and smartassed comments from the rogue she led him to the smaller of the two bedrooms in the house and left him there to rest, returning to her translations.<br>
<br>
The elf's eyes narrowed, again reading over the same line for at least the ninth time. She knew she had translated it properly, but it made no sense. Again she read the words aloud to herself, &quot; 'Here broken and here to be rebound, the strife's end must be sought before the joining of two, lest three be the outcome.' Xareth and Silverstarr are the two... How could three be the outcome?&quot; She shook her head, causing the platinum chain around her neck to move, swinging her emblem of Tunare slightly.<br>
<br>
She brought her hand to the charm to stop it's movement, inhaling sharply as her fingers touched the runed silver leaf. It was warm. Kassy thought she heard a slight scuff behind her and turned, but nothing was out of place. Shrugging off her sudden uneasiness as nothing more than a symptom of stress, she returned her eyes and thoughts to the book that lay open on her desk. Staring again at the sentence that troubled her she tried to force her mind to clear of all but the flowing text.<br>
With every minute that passed, though, she became more uneasy. Something wasnt right and she didnt know what. Putting her hand to the emblem of her goddess again a shiver of fear swept over her. The metal was pulsing, the movement becoming quicker with every beat. Terrified, Kassy stood and whirled around...<br>
<br>
The blade slid into the soft ebony skin of the enchantress' chest as she turned, blood wetting the hands of her attacker, red on blue-black. The Tier'Dal asassin looked down at her with cold green eyes as she brought a hand to her chest, trying hopelessly to seal the mortal wound. She tried in vain to stay on her feet, falling to the ground as the strength left her knees, and grabbing desperately at her attacker for support.<br>
<br>
Her weakening hand closed around an amulet that clung to the assasin's chest, but it was not enough to keep her upright. The was a tearing sensation and she fell to her back on the floor, the Tier'Dal's amulet still in her hand. As the charm came free of her attacker a change swept imeadiatly. His skin paled and his hair darkened. His ears lost their gracefully long points, becoming almost round, only slightly pointed. Only his cold green eyes remained the same. But now they were sightless. Kassy shook her head in denial, the movement hardly noticable and completely unseen by the blood-drenched half-elf who stood before her. The pain of her wound vanished in that moment, consumed by the pain of betrayal.<br>
<br>
Unable to breath all she could do was mouth the question, &quot;Minz...? Why...?&quot; Then the rogue she had called friend faded from her sight as her once sparkling saphire eyes dimmed. The world went black, and Kassy Lightborn saw no more.<br>

He was careful to send one once every other day, to check on the translation's progress. It was going slowly, as he'd expected, but knowing as much did little to increase his patience. The pale skin that covered most of his body reminded him constantly of his predicament, and it grew worse by the day. Worst of all, it itched.<br>
<br>
He ignored that burning itch as best he could and gazed out across the savanna.  The messenger would be arriving soon.<br>
<br>
The messenger arrived in due time, a young half elf. Xareth almst chuckled at the thought; the boy looked older then he did, and was far older in reality. Normally the Teir'Dal did not care to employ messengers that were not loyal to his cause, but this one could get in and out of Qeynos safely, and was paid well enough to obey. Xareth made sure he obeyed too, and reminded him occasionally of what happened to those who crossed his people. It was enough.<br>
<br>
Xareth stood and waited for the lad to approach.  &quot;Well?&quot;<br>
<br>
The sandy brown head bowed.  &quot;S-she would not answer the door, m'lord.  But her house was lit.&quot; The boy edged back a pace at the Dark Elf's growl.  &quot;But I went to see what was wrong!&quot; he added hurriedly. &quot;I went around to the back and look into her window.  She was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, and parchment was scattered everywhere.&quot; The boy dared a glance at Xareth.<br>
<br>
The warrior ignored the curiousity.  Kassy, dead? &quot;Did you see how she was slain?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, m'lord.  She's been stabbed in the chest.&quot; <br>
<br>
He pondered the information a moment. The heathen Teir'Dal was liked by the folk of the light cities, that much he knew. And only one person he knew had been contracted to slay her. <br>
<br>
He pulled out a small bag of gold and handed it to the boy. &quot;Take this and return to me with any parchments you find that she had been working on.  Do not miss any of them. And find a small black diary that should be with them.  I want to see these items by sundown tomorrow.  Understood?&quot; The boy nodded. &quot;Go, you haven't any time to waste.&quot;<br>
<br>
He watched the half elf bound away for Qeynos, brown hair flying. Kassy, slain. He knew good and well who'd taken her life.  No one else would have dared upon one who had so many powerful friends. Xareth was a little uneasy at the repercussions, but there was nothing to be done now.  His sending Minz to do the job had been excecuted at last, but the rogue's timing was bad indeed. he'd sent a messenger out to find Minz when Kassy had agreed to translate the book, to have him cry off the hunt until the translation was complete.<br>
<br>
That messenger had never returned. <br>
<br>
Well, what was done was done. The best he could do now was to get what had been translated and put it to use. With any luck at all, there would be something of worth in the translation.  Still, he couldn't help but be angry.  The rogue had probably timed the kill for the purpose, damn him.  He would have to do something about it.<br>
<br>
Xareth made his way back to his post, seething with anger and pointedly ignoring the constant itch of the light skin.<br>

<br>
Munz had stopped trying to refuse drink from the revelers some hours ago, and was by sunset quite drunk. <br>
<br>
All around him, the mountains of the Frozen Wastes vaulted skyward like frozen fingers trying to warm themselves against the fading light of the setting sun. Brightly colored fur-trimmed costumes whirled by, in time to the jig Munz played and sang. The sounds and smells of laughter and feasting ebbed and flowed in a ceaseless tide. <br>
<br>
Munz set his lute aside and leaned heavily against a great stone table, gathering himself for another set. <br>
<br>
Men and women of the North were celebrating Whitsunday, the end of the shortest day of the year. Each day from here on out would grow longer and longer until Midsummer, and then the days would fade earlier and earlier, and the sun would resume an ever-more-southerly course in it's daily sojourn accross the steel blue sky. <br>
<br>
It was a cause of great joy, for the Feast marked the end of long, cold nights on the tundra, and the return of light, warmth, and hopes for a good harvest on the windswept plains to the south. Whitsunday Feast was also the time for the Northern women to chose their mate, and to become with child so that they might give birth on the warm grass in the full of the summer. <br>
<br>
Munz had wandered past the low stone cottages only the day before. He had been travelling, running, hiding from someone or something, or himself. He chose his path at random, content to lay his fate in the hands of whatever gods might trouble themselves to look after it. He had stopped to ask for a crust or a coin, and was told he could have his fill of both the next night, if he would only play. <br>
<br>
A young barbarian girl, solid, blonde and buxom - twelve years Munz's junior yet towering above him - whirled up to him. She thrust another goblet of braggot into his left hand, and a huge, naked breast in his right. She stood quite close, smiling down on him. She was herself clearly quite drunk, breathing heavily with the exertion of the dance. Her breast heaved in his hand, and her hot breath was scented by cherry wine. <br>
<br>
&quot;Shall I choose you, little Bard?&quot; Her girlfriends giggled and tittered from a safe distance, as a few Barbarian men seemed to notice the play. They glowered at Munz from behind haunches of roasted meat. <br>
<br>
Munz hefted her breast once or twice thoughtfully, as though carefully considering her offer. <br>
<br>
&quot;If only you would, but I fear my Flute is too small for your liking.&quot; <br>
<br>
The girl laughed and skipped off to rejoin her friends. The men who had been watching howled in laughter and returned their attention to the great platters of fruit and pastry before them. <br>
<br>
Munz smiled crookedly, his head still swimming in a drunken stupor. He remembered the braggot in his left hand, and drank greedily. He gazed after the girl with wet, bloodshot eyes and imagined for a moment what it might be like to drown himself in that great sea of gorgeous flesh. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, a cloud swept accross his vision. He could not see, and the sounds of the feast were suddenly muffled and distant, as though someone had dropped a woolsack over his head. <br>
<br>
He staggered a moment and clutched at his head. The goblet he had been holding clanged on the stones as he dropped it, but even that seemed muffled. He staggered away from the table with his head in his hands, and he heard distant laughter as the men watched what they must have thought was some new jest. Munz dropped to his knees. <br>
<br>
The dark mist before his eyes seemed to part. He seemed to be in some other dark place altogether. Suddenly, he could smell brine and dark rot. He realized that there were walls of timber to either side, stretching forward into darkness. He seemed to hover high above a plank floor. <br>
<br>
He watched as a figure stumbled into view, far below him. He could not make out the features of the man below, but as the mists swirled in and out of his vision, the skin on the figure seemed to be blue, like that of a T'ier Dal, but then turned pale like his own. The figure looked up, perhaps in an effort to ascertain the location for himself. <br>
<br>
Munz looked down upon his own visage. <br>
<br>
The mists swirled black and heavy, blotting out the vision - but soon a set of clear sapphire eyes materialized before him, quite close. They were wide with surprise or fear - or both. In a few moments, they too faded into the mist of his vision. <br>
<br>
Munz did not feel his head smack hard on the stones as he fell forward from his knees and lay prone on the cold ground. He did not hear the men howl with laughter at this latest antic of the stange Bard. <br>
<br>
He slept as the Dance whirled on about him. He slept as the waning orb of the sun slipped into the waiting grasp of the mountains. He slept as the stars wheeled and flashed above him in a heavenly Dance of their own.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxarethsthanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xareth S thanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/9/01 1:37:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Contract Fulfilled</span><hr size=1> (ooc - posting this for Merecraft)<br>
<br>
The wind was blowing a gale up here in the peaks of the Skyfire Mountains. After a week of hunting the minions of Scale here, Merecraft Oakenheart had become used to the cold, biting wind, and it was with a resigned shrug that the half-elf pulled the cloak of mammoth fur closer around his shoulders and settled down to sleep. The druid's fire had burned low, emitting only a soft glow in the small depression amongst the rocks where he had settled for the night. The day had been a successful one and he had managed to track down another of the lost prayers of Tunare that the minions had stolen from her temples. Still, as he relaxed and made his plans for the morrow one image kept forcing its way into his mind, that of a dark face with large luminous eyes that drew his soul out into the Light. <br>
<br>
It was a face that had become more dear to him than all else, the face that had saved his soul from the darkness that had threatened to engulf it when he had left the Knight Templar under a cloud of suspiscion and hurt. Over the past few weeks he had grown closer to Kassy Lightborn than he had ever been to any other. He had fallen deeply in love with the young Teir Dal, a fact that still astonished him at times. What astonished him even more was that her feelings for him had grown just as strong. He smiled to himself as he thought back to the days they had spent on the islands of the Ocean of Tears, the two of them alone for days on end, finding comfort and a growing bond in each others company. After all that had happened, the betrayal of his brother, the murder of Nostramis, the loss of his mother, and the curse of Carinus, the half-elf felt happier than he had in years. <br>
<br>
Kassy and Merecraft had only been seperated for a week, but it already felt like a lifetime. She had gone back home to Qeynos on an urgent matter which required some days of research. The druid hadn't enquired too deeply, he knew that Kassy would tell him when she was ready, but he knew her well enough to know that her journey was very important. Still, this time next week they would be together again, and Merecraft's heart soared at the thought of seeing the young enchantress once more. <br>
<br>
Still smiling to himself in the darkness, Merecraft drifted off to sleep... <br>
<br>
_______________ <br>
<br>
He was back in the Tree. The poisoned blade was in his hand and he was striking out. Tunare watched him calmly as the blade plunged towards her heart. The goddess raised her hand and there was a flash of light. <br>

<br>
He was back in the Tree. No, no... still the nightmare continued. Merecraft rolled uneasily as the dreams he had suffered ever since that fateful day played out in his feverish mind. The only times he had not dreamed of the night he had tried to kill his goddess was when Kassy was at his side. The half-elf moaned as the dream continued. <br>
<br>
He was back in the Tree. The poisoned blade was in his hand and he was striking out. Tunare watched him calmly as the blade plunged towards her heart. The goddess spoke. No, she didn't speak. This wasn't how it had happened, she had said nothing. She had simply raised her hand and banished him from her prescence. The goddess spoke. Her lips did not move, there was no need. Her voice simply echoed in the druids mind. <br>
<br>
&quot;Merecraft. My daughter is in grave danger. Go to her. Let your love guide you before it is too late.&quot; <br>
<br>
He was back in the Tree. The poisoned blade was in the Dark Elf's hand and he was striking out. Merecraft watched him calmly as the blade was drawn across Kassy's throat. Kassy raised her hand, grasping at the assassin's amulet and there was a flash of light. <br>
<br>
_______________ <br>
<br>
Merecraft awoke from the dream, his heart pounding. He pushed his greying hair back from his wet brow, gasping. He knew with a terrible, cold certainty that he had been given a message and that Kassy was in danger. Not stopping to wonder why Tunare would warn him of the attack the druid staggered to his feet. Still gasping he began to intone the prayer that would take him to the ancient stone circle in the plains of Karana. He did not know what he was doing, only that if he did not reach his love in time something terrible would befall her. <br>
<br>
Bubbles of magic rose up around him and he sank to his knees as a cold fear gripped his heart. His vision blurred a moment from tears, then the mountains faded from view. A second later the plains stretched out before the druid. <br>
<br>
He felt sick, and not just from the strange green mist that surrounded the druid ring here. This wasnt right. He needed to move quickly. His hands wove an intricate pattern in the air, his lips mumbling holy words. Merecraft felt his senses heighten as the magic infused his body. His heart began to beat faster, his arms and legs were twitching as energy coursed through them, and a second later he was away, running West, the Spirit of the Cheetah infusing his soul with speed. <br>
<br>
It was going to be the longest run of his life. He continued to pray to the Mother as he ran. He prayed that he would be in time. <br>
<br>
_______________ <br>
<br>
The half-elf ran through the narrow streets of Qeynos at breakneck speed. Merchants and citizens dodged out of the way, shouting after him to slow down. As he approached the docks area Merecraft slowed down slightly, the fear of what he would find when he reached Kassy's house slowing his approach. Grimly the druid gripped his claws and turned the corner to the home of his love. He stopped dead in his tracks as he saw the ornate wooden door to the enchantress's house swinging wildly on the hinges. <br>
<br>
Merecraft pushed the door open with his claws. The first thing he saw was the shattered plant pot near the doorway. Then his eyes adjusted to the dim light of the room, his infravision picking up the red form of a body sprawled on the desk. The body was fading from orange to a cool blue in his infravision as the heat left it. The only part remaining warm was a growing pool of blood. <br>
<br>
He froze for an instant, then he recognised it was his love pinned to the table. The small room smelt like an abbatoir. <br>
<br>
The world exploded. <br>
<br>
Screaming, the half-elf ran across the room, not wishing to believe what his eyes showed him. He spun, still screaming, tears streaming down his cheeks and strode to the table. A single sweep of his arm sent the various books, beakers, and papers flying into the air. His foot kicked out, the chair flying across the room to shatter on the far wall. He bent down, and gripped the table, forcing it over on its side causing glass and wood to break. <br>
<br>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; <br>
<br>
He was too late. <br>
<br>
He spun again, his eyes rolling with madness. He gathered his prayers around him, his clawed fist bursting into flame, a rain of fire beginning to fall from the ceiling. Then the still cold form of Kassy moaned slightly... <br>
<br>
The druid stopped dead, the anger and madness flowing out of him in an instant. He dropped to his knees next to the fallen figure. There was blood everywhere. Then she moaned again, softly... &quot;Mother.... Mere...&quot; <br>
<br>
Merecraft forced his racing heart to calm down. Slowly he began to pray again, making sure that each word was intonated correctly, not daring to make even one mistake. If the magic fizzled now his love would be lost to him. As he prayed he moved his hands slowly over Kassy's broken form, the magic chlorophyll began to flow down, finding its way to the terrible wound in her blooded chest. The half-elf kept this up as long as he could, until finally all his magic was exhausted. He sat there holding Kassy's hand, sobbing softly to himself. Someone was going to pay for this. <br>
<br>
It may have been a few moments, it may have been an hour, Merecraft could not tell, when Kassy began to stir. Her eyes opened and slowly, painfully she began to sob. Merecraft gathered her in his arms, holding her tightly and thanking the Mother for the magic which had saved his love. Kissing her soft silver hair he hugged her to his chest, whispering to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are safe now love. I am here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Beneath the comforting words the druids thoughts were a boiling, seething fury. He would track down whoever had done this and make them suffer. He felt something he had not felt for many years. He felt hate. <br>

<br>
Minz faded from view; the world darkened and went black, only to reappear in shades of shifting gray a moment later. Kassy lay on her back, just as she had fallen. The cut left by the assasin's blade had nearly stopped bleeding, the flow slowing to a trickle. There was, the elf knew in the back of her mind, not much left to bleed out. <br>
<br>
Tears were falling unchecked down her ebon cheeks, though not from the pain of the wound. That had nearly vanished, washed away by the pain of betrayal she felt. &quot;Mother, just let me die,&quot; she whispered, her voice soft and broken, &quot;Please...&quot; <br>
<br>
Her quiet plea was answered by voices in the mists. Appearing from the unending gray came a Fier'Dal man dressed in leather and green chainmail decorated with the wolfprint over a leaf symbol of his house. A small elven child was at his side, her brown eyes shining with the innocence and curiosity of youth. &quot;What left this one, honey?&quot; asked the ranger. <br>
<br>
&quot;Its a wolf pawprint, Papa,&quot; she answered in a melodic voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thats right, Kassy. Youre learning very fast!&quot; Starren Cal'saith smiled proudly down at his 4-year-old daughter. &quot;Lets go find your mother and tell her how well youre doing.&quot; <br>
<br>
Starren lifted the child into his arms and vanished back into the mists. <br>
<br>
Kassy forced herself up to a sitting position, staring after the elf who had just walked away. <br>
<br>
&quot;Papa!&quot; she cried as loudly as she could in her broken voice, &quot;Papa, wait! Dont leave me again...&quot; But he was gone. <br>
<br>
More footsteps echoed quietly from the shifting gray to her left and Kassy turned to face the new arrival. It was a young wood elven woman, perhaps 17 years of age. Her long brown hair was pushed back behind gracefully pointed years and large brown eyes looked out from beneath thick lashes. The girl was beautiful, even by elven standards, but there was a sadness about her that dulled the beauty ever so slightly. <br>
<br>
The ethreal elf maid walked through the Tier'dal as though she wasnt there. Kassy watched the younger version of herself as she walked through the dark tunnel that led to Surefall Glade. She watched as she came to the entrance of the sacred Glade, and she watched as she turned away, unable to enter and face what lay within. The girl vanished into the mists. <br>
<br>
An elven scream pierced the air, and Kassy turned to see herself locked within a spell of holding, her flawless tanned skin turning blue-black at the touch of Innoruuk's curse. She watched as the younger version of herself lost consiousness and as the Prince of Hate stood over her, laughing as he sent her back to Norrath. She watched as she awoke in Neriak, weak, lost, and dark elven. <br>
<br>
&quot;I dont want to see anymore,&quot; she said in a harsh whisper. The words caused the wound on her chest to bleed freely again. &quot;Mother, please... Let me have peace. Just let it all end...&quot; <br>
<br>
The image shifted and she was running in the pouring rain through the muddy streets of northern Freeport. She slipped and fell to her knees, her eyes falling to her reflection in the puddle before her. She slammed her fist into the water, shattering the image of the dark elf, &quot;No!&quot; she shouted into the stormy night, &quot;This isnt me. Im not Tier'dal! Im not...&quot; <br>
<br>
The puddle rippled and reformed. There was a second face in it staring back at her now. A hand came to rest on the apparition of Kassy's shoulder. &quot;Who are you? Your voice is that of an elf who once called to me for aid but your face is that of one of Innoruuk?s children. Tell me your name, and why you were at our guild hall this night.&quot; <br>
<br>
The young elf stuttered, looking up at the half-elf, &quot;Sir Merecraft...&quot; Her words were cut off as the pair vanished into the mist. <br>
<br>
Kassy turned her face away from where the image of her love had stood, her eyes filling with tears. A voice in the gray called her name. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy. C'mon, baby, its time to come home.&quot; The voice was soft, musical. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mamma?&quot; Kassy whispered as she rose slowly to her feet. &quot;Mamma, is it really you...?&quot; <br>
<br>
The mists swirled and shifted, taking the shape of the mother that Kassy could barely remember. The druidess stood in the mist, arms outstreached. She was tall for a wood elf, with hair that shone like fresh honey, natural copper highlights bringing out the emerald green of her eyes. Kassy began to walk slowly toward her, bringing a tanned hand to her face to wisk the dark hair from her eyes. The dark hair... <br>
<br>
Kassy looked down at herself. She was wearing her old druid's garb over her lightly tanned skin. She gasped, then closed her eyes, searching her mind for the words of magic that would mesmerize a foe or send send their mind screaming in anarchy. They were gone, replaced by the healing words of Tunare, prayers that would transport her across the world or infuse her with the spirit of the wolf. She opened her eyes and looked back. <br>
<br>
Laying upon the ground was the body of a young dark elf, the gaping wound upon her chest bleeding slowly as the last traces of life were leaving her body. Kassy looked at her a moment, then turned and walk away toward the voice from her past. She stopped as a second voice came from behind her, where the dark elf lay. <br>
<br>
&quot;Noooooo!&quot; <br>
<br>
The mists around the dying Tier'dal shifted, taking on the features of Kassy's home. Standing over the body of the dark elf was a half-elf dressed all in black. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mere...&quot; whispered the Fier'dal Kassy. <br>
<br>
He was storming through the room, tearing it apart in madness. As he looked at his fallen love again his fist began to glow, fire slowly starting to rain down from the celing. Kassy's heart broke as she watched him. She loved the druid with all her heart and she knew he felt the same for her. How could she leave him behind? <br>
<br>
She looked from Merecraft to the mother she had missed so dearly since she was a child. She looked also at looked at herself, at her tanned skin and dark hair. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kassy,&quot; Kirri's voice was soft, <br>
pleading. &quot;If you go back, if you accept the Tier'Dal body, you will never again wear your true form. We will never be together again. You can feel it in your heart... Please, baby, let it go. Tunare has given you this chance to come home.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I cant, Momma... I love him.&quot; <br>
<br>
A tear welled up in her shining brown eyes as she turned away from Kirri Cal'saith and stepped over to the fallen Tier'dal. She leaned down and touched the dark elf with tanned fingertips... <br>
<br>
Kassy's still, cold form moaned slightly... <br>
<br>
Merecraft stopped dead, the madness leaving him in an instant. He dropped to his knees next to the fallen figure. There was blood everywhere, the wound again trickling silently. Then she moaned again, softly... &quot;Mother... Mere...&quot; <br>
<br>
Merecraft forced his racing heart to calm down. Slowly he began to pray again, making sure that each word was intonated correctly, not daring to make even one mistake. If the magic fizzled now his love would be lost to him. As he prayed he moved his hands slowly over Kassy's broken form, the magic chlorophyll began to flow down, finding its way to the terrible wound upon her chest. The half-elf kept this up as long as he could, until finally all his magic was exhausted. He sat there holding Kassy's hand, sobbing softly to himself. <br>
<br>
Some time later Kassy stired. Her blue eyes opened and slowly, painfully she began to cry. Merecraft gathered her in his arms, holding her tightly and thanking Tunare for the magic which had saved his love. Kissing her soft silver hair he hugged her to his chest, whispering to her. <br>
<br>
&quot;You are safe now love. I am here.&quot; <br>
<br>
Weakened as she was, Kassy lifted her eyes and looked at one of her delicate hands. It was dark as night. Silent tears rolled down her cheeks as she mouthed the word, &quot;Mamma...&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxarethsthanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xareth S thanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/9/01 1:41:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Contract Fulfilled</span><hr size=1> The sun was low on the horizon. <br>
<br>
Xareth was seated on the ground, absently poking a mostly dead campfire. The redish hues of the sunset stretched across the Karanas and bathed everything it touched with it's glow. An elephant calf lumbered along the ridge toward the water, flopping it's ears about absently. One could almost forget the plague that had cursed the land. The warrior added wood to the fire and ushered the flames back to life. His water supply was all but gone, and the water in the area was no longer safe to drink. He would have to boil it first. <br>
<br>
A lone tree stood near the once clean stream, stubbornly refusing to yield to the slow death of the plague. Skeletal branches sported a few withered leaves that fluttered aimlessly in the breeze. The thing reminded him of his own predicament, of his constant mental battle against the sickness that threatened to kill him. &quot;Soon,&quot; he muttered. Hopefully soon all of this would be over. A light sound caught the Dark Elf's attention, and he turned toward it, resting one hand on the hilt of a blade. <br>
<br>
The sound came again, a soft rustle. Something was off in the high grass. For a moment the Teir'Dal though it might be the calf, but dismissed the idea upon seeing it farther downstream. There were still many creatures roaming the savanna, but not all were friendly. He gently pulled a sword from it's sheath and approached the grass. Whatever was there was coming faster now, and making no attempt to hide itself. A dark form burst into view and nearly bowled over the warrior. <br>
<br>
An off balance warrior is always an easy target, and a Teir'Dal is no exception. The form came at him in a frenzy, and Xareth swung his blade about to parry, then danced away to face -- <br>
<br>
Minz?? <br>
<br>
He stood staring, not beleiving his eyes. Minz was crouched several feet away, his blade and clothing spotted with blood and earth, and looking for all the world like a caged animal. A once smiling face was now hollow, and the half elf's eyes reflected inner torment. Xareth kept his stance, unsure of the rogue's intent. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; <br>
<br>
He'd spoken more harshly than intended, and the rogue's blind eyes narrowed in recognition. &quot;You,&quot; he growled. &quot;What have you done?!&quot; He moved slowly in a crouch, one hand testing the ground for footing, his face fixed in the Teir'Dal's direction. <br>
<br>
The sight of the half elf intrigued Xareth. He remembered one of his spies reporting the change that had taken place in the rogue. The spy spoke of the rogue's being in Paineel, and the amulet that had been bestowed upon him at the Teir'Dal's own cost. There seemed to be more blood collected on the rogue's chest. He wondered what that meant. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; he said. &quot;You look the worse for wear, lost rogue. Again, what brings you to my camp?&quot; <br>
<br>
Minz rose, seeming to teeter on his balance for a moment. &quot;Worse for wear? You contracted me to slay one of my best friends, you bastard!&quot; He clenched his fists in rage, one hand gripping his dagger until the knuckles turned white. &quot;How DARE you do that to me?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, does that bother you? I see the gift that was given to you still hasn't taken it's full effect. And remember, you agreed to carry out a contract for me, on a target of my choosing. Na'Verdis has been a pain in my side for some time.&quot; Minz still stood clenching his fists, so Xareth sheathed his sword. there would be no fighting this time. &quot;Come now, tell me. Have you carried out your mission?&quot; <br>
<br>
The rogue didn't answer, but his lowered head and tear-stained face gave the warrior all the answer he needed. His messenger had hinted as much earlier that day. Still, Minz could not have picked a worse time to carry out the contract. Kassy was the only one who could sucessfully translate the language in his old diary, and if she failed, he was doomed. Minz had been forced to choose between friends, and in choosing Silverstarr over Kassy, he may very well have forfeited both of their lives, and his own as well. Xareth was furious that his order to back off the hunt until the translation was complete, but nothing could be done about it. All he could do was hope that the messenger returned with enough of a translation to figure out what was needed to lift the sickness. <br>
<br>
Xareth smiled, considering Minz's predicament. That amulet would slowly turn him into a Tier'Dal, mind, body, and soul. How many times had he used it? The possibilities opened up before him. Minz was the current leader of the Order of Elder Dragons. Those lightborn fools would follow him to the nine hells and back if he simply asked him to. If the amulet finished it's job, then his own wish to turn the Dragons to darkness could easily be completed. <br>
<br>
&quot;I hate you,&quot; Minz muttered, his voice dripping with venom. &quot;I hate you! My family, my friends, my life! All of it was taken because of you!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Really, Minz, you should see the positive side of things. Do you really wish to live out your existence leading some meager band of lightdwellers? Your amulet can give you many things. It will change who you are, and make you something much better.&quot; He moved toward the rogue, coming to stand right in front of him. Minz looked uneasy, but refused to budge. &quot;You can become one of my people, and live for a reason. The death of Kassy was simply the beginning, one of the trials you must face. Think about it for a moment. You have nothing left; you just said it yourself. You can begin a new life, and live well.&quot; <br>
<br>
Minz roared and launched at Xareth. The warrior saw it coming, but was too close to dodge, and fought desparately for footing as Minz tried to get a death lock on his throat. The rogue's blade came up to strike, and Xareth finally lost all balance. Both combatants fell heavily to the ground. <br>
<br>
Xareth twisted out from under the enraged rogue and managed to deflect the weapon with a bracer. It bit harshly into the metal armor, denting it badly and cutting into the Dark Elf's ruining flesh. The two grappled on the ground for a moment, rolling and kicking like pumas in the dust. Minz was in an asolute frenzy, shouting incoherently and slashing wildly with his dagger, and it was all Xareth could do to keep from getting badly injured. One slice caught him across the cheek, tearing into the half dark skin viciously. He managed to grab the half elf's swinging arm, and stop the blade attack. Then he punched him smartly in the face, dazing him. <br>
<br>
Xareth snatched the rogue's dagger and leapt to his feet, planting on boot firmly on the elf's chest. Minz was shaking his head, trying to clear it. He glared down at him coldly. &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot; <br>
<br>
The rogue spat up at him, still furious. He tried squirming out from under the warrior's metal boot, so Xareth drew a sword with his free hand and levelled it's point at the rogue's face. Minz caught the sound of the blade and stopped instantly, feeling the prick of the sword's tip. <br>
<br>
Minz glared up at the warrior, his empty eyes seeming to find the dark face. &quot;Kill me already. I have nothing left to live for. You made certain of that!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And why should I kill you,&quot; he retorted evenly, &quot;when you still have your uses? You are not as hopeless as you believe yourself, Pendragon.&quot; He smiled at the rogue's shocked reaction to the title. &quot;Aye, you still have your uses.&quot; He dropped the rogue's weapon next to it's owner and stepped away. Minz got up slowly, covered with dust, and found the fallen weapon after a bit of sweeping for it with a hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; said Xareth. &quot;Get gone from here. I have other business to complete. I'll come find you when I am ready.&quot; He started to turn away, then thought better of it. &quot;I suggest you do not try anything foolish, Minz. You have completed your job, let it go at that.&quot; He watched Minz for a moment. It was apparent that the other was broken, feeling utterly lost and useless to anyone. Assassins were generally the type to keep from having close relationships with anyone, and preferred to keep to their own. This one, however, had taken leadership of a guild, and had even had a family. Losing the family had cost him dearly, and when his guild discovered that he was the instrument of Kassy's death, they might very well throw him to the wolves. <br>
<br>
But all of that was meaningless to the warrior. Minz was falling from his pedastal, turning and slowly shaping into something more useful. If the amulet finished it's job, soon Minz would no longer care, and might even gladly accept servitude to the Father's will. He was going to be patient. <br>
<br>
Xareth waited to see what Minz would do. <br>
