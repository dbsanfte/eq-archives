I try to be polite and respectful as I can but it gets me no where. I want to try to do stuff to better myself and my gear, but I dont know what to do, Im fresh out of ideas, and the people in my level range on my server are not helpnig me either. Should I just give up? Be aggresive and rude rather than nice and polite? I mean, is it my gear? What should I do? Sitting LFG for 3+ hours is really working on my nerves..and I need help.<br><br>Grr, and no, Im not trying to get pity or whatever, Im just asking for honest suggestions.

That venue is brutal but in the long run you meet some great people.<br><br>Anyway, your pass that.  I agree, serious sit down and look for a guild that may fit your playing style.  It does not sound like you are a power gamer so a family oriented guild seems more your taste.  <br><br>I'm in the Order of Concord Guild on Tunare and they has another chapter on other server.  Some things that I look for in a guild.  <br><br>1) A good website... Important for guild even information.<br>2) Plenty of activities.<br>3) More based on fun as opposed to raiding all the time.<br>4) Decent size (70 to 150) members is a rough estimate with about 10 to 20% of those members in teh 50+ levels.<br><br>Just some thoughts but a guild at the high end is key or a good set of friends.<br><br>I am lucky to have both.  My entire friends list is comprised of Old and Current Dragon raiders and they serve as a secondary guild.  On many occasions I get tells about events in Kael, the Planes, Chadok, Seb, Tov, the Hole, HS.

So his play time is eratic i suppose. Second off I find people like this all the time. I call them the lost ones. RL has em so does this game. Some people just get lost through the cracks. Some people join crappy guilds and feel obligated not to leave so they hit 55+ wham they cant go do all the cool stuff cause their guild is low. So they sit LFG for hours in Seb. Lost to the events happening in ToV or Sleepers, missing out on all the great gear. They may have full planer gear and have a good weapon and such but the awesome stuff is unattainable to them. I was fortunate enough when i started playin I found a fellow Paladin friend to explore Norrath with. And then fell into a good guild and progressed on. We also learned all our quests. This was when there was an actual Paladins of Norrath site. In fact my friend has the Making of ro guide here in Tomes of Knowledge.<br>All I can suggest to you as a young Paladin is toughen up and get into a good guild. Explain to them you are Military so you cant be there at all times or promise for raids. if anything bro, meet some people. If I hadnt met the people in the game theres no way i wouldve kept playin as long as you. And as much as a Pally is fun to play, we arent required for a group. We have fun silly spells and can do some cool stuff, but we are rarely called a main tank, we are never the primary healer, we arent there for buffs, we are there for support alot of the times. Oh sure you want a pally on that Dragon Raid with Wave of Healing Prexus so we can heal ya during the AE's. Or maybe LOH the Puller when he snags a big one, maybe they let you pull with DA now and then. But on the norm we are about as wanted as sack of schwag. Now this doesnt mean all Pallies are like this, some have proven their skills to others and taken charge. Some log on and get groups imediately. Some pallies probably even have people waiting for them to log on so they can go do something. But alas even the 60 Crusader in full ToV and an Epic can be LFG. Anyway just play your Pally to have fun. It is just game............isn't it?<br><br>Dariusking Undeadslayer<br>59 Knight<br>Frozen Spirits<br>Saryrn Server<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubeldukil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beldukil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 3681<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/22/02 9:39:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://beld.freeservers.com/images/beld.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> Check into medium and small sized guilds on your server who are recruiting.<br><br>Find ONE (no one likes guild shoppers) that you think you would be a good fit in and post on their web board.  <br><br>Tell them your story and why you would be a good fit in their guild.

Not quite so bad I guess, as I do have regular friends that I hang out with, but never really found my guild. I started the game when some friends from work introduced me to it. When I bought my wife an account we had 10 ppl and started our own guild. Well some ppl stopped playing and others didnt play as much, by the time I hit level 53, I just wasnt getting as much from the guild as I wanted from a guild.<br><br>So I joined another small guild, with higher level people, that I had some EQ friends in. That guild merged with 2 other guilds into one large guild. Which then fell apart because the merger was just too much.<br><br>So then I went unguilded for a while, when I met some people that were really NICE and they wanted me to join them. So I did, only I ended up in a guild with roughly 4 ppl online the majority of my playing time. In the last month I did not see more than 10ppl in /gu at any one time. So last night I left them.<br><br>I want to be in a guild that has numbers, and raids frequently. But also in a guild that hasn't already surpassed parts of the game I want to do... i.e. Kael Arena, HoT, Western Wastes and the smaller Velious Bosses plus Trak. After being in several guilds that have not worked out, its hard not to shop for the right one. Leaving guilds, or watching guilds break up is NOT fun. I do not want to do that again.<br><br>I think I have found my solution. I truly hope it works out well, but with my luck when it comes to guild who knows. Just be careful not to judge someone because they are looking into several guilds, not everyone is a loot whore. Some people just want to make sure they find the right match for themselves. <p><bold><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101014">Varner Rapscallion</a> <br>59 Knight of Brell<br> Master Brewer, Fletcher, Potter, Baker</bold></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/22/02 9:32:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> i've been in several guilds. but i never took a single item from a guild that i wasn't in for a very long time.<br><br>let me explain. guilds set up probationary periods so that they can see if you fit in with them, if they like you etc. i basically use that probie period the same way. i dont want any of thier loot, until i am sure that is where i want to stay. if the guild is not right for me, i /guildremove, thank them for the time i was in, and move on. i don't feel obligated to stay in one guild jsut because i wear that tag. i don't feel anything obligates you to a guild.<br><br>if your not happy move on. i'd suggest not making enemies along the way...cause more times then not people from your old guilds somehow wind up in that new guild your applying for<br><br><br>---Ariakkas <p>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52762 </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaremulosia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AremUlosia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/knight.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/02 1:11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/TalidPA_.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> Thanks for all the honest suggestions guys, it really means alot. <br><br>It is really hard to try to level to 60 to get into the highest guilds that do things when your schedule is so erratic its not predicable.

I mainly soloed and was unguilded into my 20s, then invited into two guilds that summer trhough friends. Neither worked out (in the second case I and my friends left together, so I did have the support of a regular exp group) and I reached 50 unguilded. In late fall, 1999, I joined a fairly small, but highly skilled, guild that grew to be one of the stronger guilds on the server (for those Innoruuk oldtimers, it was Lords of Aesir, which later became Lords of Edelo after a merger). When, sadly, that guild disbanded in summer 2001, I lost my enthusiasm for EQ and was inactive and canceled for many months.<br><br>I was faced with a similar situation to the poster when I reactivated my account recently. Many of my old friends, and even many guilds I was familiar with, are gone from the game. Some friends remain unguilded and were content to play new low level characters for the moment. Others were scattered into guilds with which I was unfamiliar or uninterested. After speaking with a lot of people, I guested in ToV this weekend with a guild that includes some old guildmates. I felt very comfortable with them and am hoping to join. I hope things work out for the initial poster also <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>Crusader of Mithaniel Marr, Level 60 <BR>Innoruuk<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uraxian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raxian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 9:34:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> What you can do....(though I am not high enough to really comment lvl wise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Look for Raid posting on server listings (Dragon Raids that dont have a max lvl or Epic Raids) Sometimes just participating in something like that helps, and is fun.

I will send you a tell in game. Hopefully we can start grouping more! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>For any whom consider grouping with Taliddar:<br>I have grouped with him on a couple occasions. He is one of the finest players I have run into in a while. The first night I met him we were in Maiden's eye. I was hunting with my husband and needed some more help with tanking. He was a great addition to the group, very versatile and willing to adapt to the groups needs. <br><br>I have seen him give his time and help with no concern for exp or loot. One night he helped my guildmate (whom Tal did not know) with Fay. He came out to help simply because I asked him if he could. He did not really know anyone but he spent a large chunk of time that night to help my friend. <br><br>From what I know of him thus far he is a fine paladin and a great guy. <br><br>Sincerely,<br>Caoimhe Dawnfyre<br>Directionally Challanged Druid of 55 Seasons<br>Phoenix Alliance<br>~Tunare~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukidkod1ak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kidkod1ak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 1:06:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> Sounds like you have some friends after all Taliddar. <p><bold><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101014">Varner Rapscallion</a> <br>59 Knight of Brell<br> Master Brewer, Fletcher, Potter, Baker</bold></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaremulosia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AremUlosia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/knight.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/25/02 1:45:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14990.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/TalidPA_.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Any help for a lone paladin?</span><hr size=1> Hey hey, I cant believe this result. I was honestly expecting to get flamed for asking for help, but instead I get people to really care...man, really restores my faith in people. Wish their were more people like you on my server. ( Tunare ) Shesh, just thanks, thanks for giving me suggestions and nice responses, every time I ask for help on my server's boards I get called bad names and accused of being a wuss @$$ and trying to get attention from people.<br><br>Its difficult for me, I dont know what people are looking for attention wise, Im nice and polite and the like, but Im never spoken too or asked to join anything ( except for caomhie ) and it gets discuraging. I dont know how much longer I have before Im sent somewhere for a duty assignment, so I kinda want to enjoy EQ to the fullest while I can. Any places I can go for good exp or popular places to meet people?
