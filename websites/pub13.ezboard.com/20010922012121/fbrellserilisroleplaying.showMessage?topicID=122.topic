With a last somber gaze at her Kelethin home she made the short trip to Felewithe. There she stayed the evening and gave her farewells to the clerics and holy knights of Tunare. Many a time in her life was retold, both sorrowful and happy.<br>
<br>
She did not sleep that night, instead she prayed. She prayed to Tunare to keep a watchful eye on those who held her heart. For those with whom she had lived, and fought, and died. For those who had made her laugh, and made her cry. From the mightiest people who storm the planes, to those who exterminate the vermin around the gates of the cities of Norrath it mattered not. What mattered is that they had somehow reached out and made a difference in her life. For those she prayed that night.<br>
<br>
In the morning her journey continued to Kaladim where she met her family. Glad they were to see her now that she saw things with perfect clarity. Remembrances were made, a grand party was given, and the dwarves of Kaladim did not wake until two days later. Here her resolve was tested most. She left them with hugs, kisses, and smiles. However, when she finally left she did not look back, for she did not wish them to see her cry.<br>
<br>
The boat to Freeport was fairly uneventful, save the chatter of the crew.<br>
<br>
She made her way through the windy streets of the human city and found herself at the temple she had chosen. With a deep breath she entered and ascended the steps to the top of the massive temple. There her closest friends were gathered with concern showing upon their faces for they did not know yet what was to happen. She then told them her thoughts, and that she meant to leave this realm, forever. However, her purpose in bringing them all together was not so they could share in the sorrow of goodbye. Rather that she could tell them of the joy they brought to her life. From their meeting in Unrest to the felling of the mighty hill giants of Rathe Mountains they had always been there for her and shared many hardships, but much more so there had been good times. For a long time they talked and the hour grew late. Finally, the time had come. With one last warm embrace to each of her friends and a curtsey she turned to the dias and strode forth. With arms ascending to the heavens she spoke, “I Caya Andrometum, your humble servant, am ready to do your work in another realm Mother.” A light, barely perceptible at first, shone down from the heavens, gradually gaining in intensity until it flared blindingly. When the light was gone so was Caya who had stood there a moment before. All that was left of her was a single tear.<br>
<br>
Fare thee well Norrath<br>
