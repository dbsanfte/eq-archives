grace, Chapter 7: Redemption's Price</span><hr size=1> The taverns had been her refuge for weeks now. It was always the same. She would take her table in the corner of the bar, Tassel’s wife would bring a bottle of brandy to the table and take the few plat that were left on the table’s surface. A word was never spoken, and it was learned early on that Anari was to be left alone<br>
<br>
She would spend her nights there, hidden amongst the crowds of drunks and whores, drowning herself deep within the bottom of the bottles. She would watch the fights, even start a few. She still sported the bruises from the last brawl she incited.  But mostly she would just sit in her corner and stare out into the crowd.<br>
<br>
And still, nothing seemed to help. <br>
<br>
The faces of those she had once called friend haunted her. Faces of those lost in battle, those she had parted ways with. Faces of ones she had hurt, and betrayed.  She saw them now as clearly as she could see the other patrons of Tassel’s Tavern.  <br>
<br>
She would drink until she could no longer stomach another drop of the bitter liquid. She would rise from the table of the crowded tavern and slowly make her way out of the city and into the Commons, toward a building long forgotten. It was there that she felt at peace, if that is what it could be called. She still saw the faces, still felt the guilt,  but somehow being inside that place she wasn’t so alone.<br>
<br>
It had been abandoned for years now, but  the former guildhall of the Silent Shadows looked as it had the night she and the other Shadows had first entered its doors. Not many remembered what the building once was, or where it was for that matter. But she would find it even if she lost her sight. It was a part of her, and as long as she still drew breath it would be her home.<br>
<br>
Her only home.<br>
<br>
As she approached it now,  the memories of it flooded her as they did every time she looked upon it. There had been many nights that she, Sytran and Huzyur spent drinking and talking into the morning hours. To them she hadn’t been a slave, or a Guild Mistress,  or a thief and assassin.  They were friends, the best of friends that no mortal force could separate.<br>
<br>
But now they were gone, both called into oblivion by their gods. Sytran when the paint on the guildhall walls was still new. Huzyur only a few months ago.  She mourned their passing, for the loss of the only two people in the world that knew her and accepted her for what she was. How she longed to join them, to once again drink with them in the world beyond the mortal life. Yet how many times had she died now, only to be denied that which she desired most?<br>
<br>
She opened the door, stepping into the darkness<br>
<br>
&quot; Illuminate .&quot;<br>
<br>
The torches the lined the walls burst to life, their flames filling the main room with their soft light, and a fire began to burn in the hearth. Closing the door behind her she moved throughout the room.  Removing her cloak, and weapons belt, she draped them over the back of a chair as she walked toward the fireplace.  <br>
<br>
Her eyes strayed to the numerous crests that were mounted on the vaulted wall. Each one representing a former member of the Silent Shadows. All of them had gone their separate ways when the guild disbanded, when she had failed them. <br>
<br>
Reaching up she removed one, a black raven with a silver sword in its talons on a blood red background. She had taken the name of Ravensblade when she had been released from Neriak. No longer a slave, but no longer welcomed in the tree city of her people. No family, no friends, no place she could call home, she had had no choice but to create her own place in the world. <br>
<br>
But doing so had cost her a great price. In turning to the shadier  side of Norrath she soon lost sight of who she had once been. Her innocence, honor, humanity. Each one slowly ebbing away with each life she took, with each drop of blood she had shed. It had been just a matter of time before nothing was left of who she was, leaving behind only Ravensblade. <br>
<br>
Slipping her hand within the folds of her tunic, she removed the guild pin of the Order of Elder Dragons. She had given it back to Cresida the night Olassen had witnessed her killing the Teir’Dal dragoon.  The terrified look in the young druid’s eyes haunted her more than any other. But Minz had sought her out, had given her back the pin and told her she would always have a place among them. <br>
<br>
In one hand she held the pin, in the other was held her crest. Two symbols of who she was, of who she could be.<br>
<br>
With a scream of rage and disgust she spun and threw the crest across the room, the ornate object shattering as it hit the opposite wall.<br>
<br>
Her fading scream echoed through the empty hall as she slumped into a nearby chair. Staring at the pin in her hand she finally began to understand. For everything she had worked for, everything she had gone through over the years, no one would mourn her when she was gone. They would not mourn the Ravensblade. Why would they?<br>
<br>
She was nobody.<br>
<br>
Lost in her self-pity she did not notice the door open, did not see the silent form enter the hall and move behind her. Only when the figure drew its dark hands from within its cloak did she become aware of another presence. But it was too late.<br>
<br>
The garrote wrapped around her throat, instantly cutting of her air. Dropping the pin to the floor, her fingers clawed at the thin rope as she was pull out of her chair and to her feet. It was cutting into her flesh and she could feel blood seeping from beneath the cord. Once again in a fight for her life she found herself wanting to live. She would not die like this.<br>
<br>
Years of training came rushing back and her panic fled. She thrust her head back, the fiber cutting deeper into her throat as her head connected with the nose of her attacker. A heartbeat later she drove her elbow into the abdomen with all her strength.  She heard the air rush out of the person’s lungs and felt the grip on the garrote falter. Forcing her fingers between the rope and her skin she was able to pull it from the hands of the assassin.<br>
<br>
She gulped in the crisp night air as she collapsed to her knees. Turning her head she finally got a good look at her attacker. He - she assumed it was a man from the width of the shoulders and bulk of body - was cloaked in black, a hood covering his face in shadows. A snarl emanated from beneath the hood and two weapons  - a spear and a dagger - were drawn from within the folds of the cloak.<br>
<br>
Desperate, she grabbed a chair by its legs and  threw it at him as she tried to scrambled away. The chair bounced off his arm and he easily closed the distance between him and her. With a low growl he spun the spear and drove the jagged tip into her leg as she crawled beneath a table. <br>
<br>
Her cry shattered the night as the spear pinned her leg to the floor. The table above her was easily tossed aside and she lashed out with her free leg. Her foot connected squarely with his knee, the joint snapping loudly as it bent the wrong way. His own scream rang through the hall as he dropped his dagger and clutched his now broken leg, crumpling to the floor.<br>
<br>
Gritting her teeth she pulled the weapon from her leg, its serrated edges tearing through her flesh,  and used it to get unsteadily to her feet. Her leg beneath the bleeding spear wound was numb and practically dead weight as she limped closer toward him.  She knocked the discarded blade away from his hand, and with the tip of the spear she pushed back his hood.<br>
<br>
She stared down at the Teir’Dal, blood flowing from his swollen nose, the spear scraping against his throat. &quot; You?! You were at the bar tonight! You’re the one who started the fight! Why are you following me, who sent you?!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot; No one sent me, Anari.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her eyes widened with shock as she recognized the voice. But how could this be - &quot; Minz?!?!&quot; <br>

She stood upon a plane of endless mist feeling horribly alone and yet terribly exposed.  She knew that He was there, that she couldnt escape Him, and yet she ran.  Always she ran.  It didnt matter, He always caught her, always tortured and battered her to the edge of death, but couldnt kill her.  Always His face was crossed with the same wicked grin as He pronounced her fate.  The dream was always the same. <br>
<br>
This time it was different.<br>
<br>
Kassy tossed and turnd in her sleep as the darkness crept over her in her dreams.  But rather than waking when at last the pain over came her, she was merely released from the spell that held her still while she was Changed, and crumpled to the ground gasping for air.  At once she was glad that the torture had ended and terrified of what was to come.  Every night since she had become Tier'dal she had the dream and always it had been the same with only a few exceptions. It was those exceptions, more than the dream itself, that terrified her.  Something was going to happen...<br>
<br>
The mists shifted, moving about to create a landscape that was recognizable as the Commonlands.  To her left was a building that appeared to have seen better days.  Now the paint was chipping off and one shutter hung dangling from a window.  There was a sense of sadness, of emptiness and loss, about the building, and yet light came from within.  With the light came the sounds of battle.<br>
<br>
Moving with the grace and silence given to all elven people, the enchantress made her way to the open door of the hall and looked in.  <br>
<br>
Anari stood there, hurt, but standing over a dark elf who lay upon the floor, one leg obviously broken.  Something about the dark elf was familiar, as though she'd seen the face somewhere before...  She stayed outside, an inner voice warning her not to be seen, to stay away from that Tier'dal, though she didnt know why. Until Anari spoke...<br>
<br>
“I wouldn’t believe her, believe the rumors that it was you that tried to kill her. But this is how you got to Kassy, isn’t it Minz.”<br>
<br>
Kassy's saphire eyes went wide as she realized where she'd seen that face before.  Her right hand went to the scar that lay above her heart... the scar inflicted by this dark elf's blade.  She thought she would fall, and reached out, grabbing the door frame. The paint chipped off at her touch, splinters catching in her soft hands, but she paid them no heed.  All of her attention was focused on the dark elf lying on the floor.<br>
<br>
He smiled, white teeth gleeming dangerously in the torch light, “Very good. And she was only the beginning. Once I kill you I’ll kill the rest of the Dragons. One by one. Slowly, and painfully.” <br>
<br>
“You? Kill me?” The wood elf laughed, though she was obviously unnurved. “ I’m not the one lying on the floor with a broken leg and weaponless. ”<br>
<br>
“True, but I’m not the one who’s paralyzed.” He slipped from beneath her weapon, the hatred in his eyes burning hot as he watched her, frozen and now terrified. <br>
<br>
Even as she started to speak again, she, Minz, and the building lost their solididty and became once again no more than mist. Echoing through the endless grey came a voice that sent chills through Kassy's body.<br>
<br>
&quot;She was only the beginning...&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kassy awoke with a start, her breathing so rapid that she was becoming lightheaded. <br>
<br>
&quot;A dream,&quot; she said aloud to comfort herself, &quot;Nothing more than a dream...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her voice trailed off, however, as she saw something that made her catch her breath.  Lying upon the sheets where she had been sleeping were chips of paint and splinters...<br>
