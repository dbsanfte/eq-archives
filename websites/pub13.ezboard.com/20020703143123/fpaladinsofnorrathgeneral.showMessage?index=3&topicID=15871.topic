Then again, this was back before Kunark opened up, when the best armor for Paladins at that level was the Armor of Ro, and the Ghoulbane was the weapon of choice.  The only thing I could solo then were the giant skeletons in the Rathe Mtns. <br>
<br>
Now however, I think its easier for Paladins to solo.  We have a better range of spells, you can get good armor without going through those hellish Ro quests, you can buy better weapons now than we used to be able to get.  The class is better overall and you can solo.<br>
<br>
Personally, while soloing is one way to get exp, I prefer groups.  Half the fun of EQ is the social interaction with other players.  You miss out on much of that while soloing.  Granted, after sitting in Velks for a while trying desperately to find a group, I will go find a spot to solo (OOT is nice, seafuries con blue).  <br>
<br>
Yes, Paladins can tank.  Yes, Paladins can solo.  There are some people out there who might not know how to play the Paladin class and they may give other players the wrong impression, but we are still a fun viable class to play.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as for piercers.  I was lucky and won a Lance of Thunder in WToV.  I highly recommend this weapon if you can get it.  Great damage and makes soloing that much easier! <p><center>

My armor at the time was a full set of FS that I just purchased using my Lake of Ill Omen earnings (along with one level in Frontier Mountains)  I stayed there until level 36 earning about 200 plat every morning before work (about 90 minutes playing time).<br>
<br>
So, soloing is possible, in the cold cold north at level 30.  After 36 - I teamed in RATHE until level 40...just because it was fun, and we all camped there...so no looking for groups.<br>
Then at 40 I did not solo, except when I could grab a stray Kobold (sol b).  I COULD solo them, if adds would not pop up, or trains running my butt.<br>
<br>
I am most proud of this one fact:  I spent levels 40-51 in SOL B.  I died once when I went LD (and not under attack) right at zone.  And I died once when a herd of IMPS were trained without warning at Bats/Bugs.  In the entire 11 levels there, I did not die in battle, or by any train, save the Bats/Bugs one.  I think 11 levels with no 'real' deaths is pretty good!<br>
<br>
I love teaming, especially with my steady team, as it is chain pulling and nice loot.  It was fun last week in OOT, as I sort of Challenge my Team, trying to pull as many Seafuries as possible (no chanter or bard) and me the only tank.  But with two druids, a shaman and a Wizzy along with me, well, the Furies did not stand a chance.  We even got the Tainted Corrupt Combo, as well as Quag, so everyone was happy.  Most I could gather up at one time though was four...even though I REALLY wanted to see if we could do 6.<br>
<br>
Fun part was that I was never in danger, and never had to self heal.<br>
<br>
I would probably have solo'ed more in my life had i Not built up such a loathing for KUNARK zones (save LOIO)...  I just HATE it there. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uriggorsmortus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RiggorsMortus</A> at: 6/24/02 3:49:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upopitinythug.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Popi Tinythug</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/02 3:00:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15871.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.fortunecity.com/popidathug/poppic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If a Pally Can't Solo, why am I always the only Solo Mel</span><hr size=1> Ok lemme tell you one thing... if you arent a rogue you CAN solo for xp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usjoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sjoc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/02 3:02:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15871.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If a Pally Can't Solo, why am I always the only Solo Mel</span><hr size=1> I've soloed quite a bit durring my life as an EQ pally. From 1 to 9 was all solo or partnered, 9 to 15 I soloed in EC/WC occasionally getting an orc/derv group, 15-20 I soloed gators in oasis with occasional orc or TD groups. 20 to 30 I was in LoIO soloing the undead ruins with the occasional Sarnak Frot group. In my early 30's I started grouping a bit more in FM killing giants for loot and fun, then moved on to soloing mobs in OT as well as or better than my friend who was a druid about the same level and quad kiting. Later 30's I was in GD soloing the bear caves and Frost giant scouts. That continued into my 40's until I ended up in DL.<br>
<br>
Before some of the pally revamps I found my late 40's and early 50's soloable but barely (todays pally would do much better). Now at 60 I find soloing in FG and Velk cake.<br>
<br>
Pallies are a good solo class as well as a good group class, and a great tank.  Any one who says othewise is eith just mis informed or a total idiot. Personally I love that I heard the call of the pally in EQ since right now its a lot of fun to play the class. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133603><img src=http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/jayrj1/sigsjoc.jpg><br>My Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrilin31.showPublicProfile?language=EN>krilin31</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/21/02 8:24:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15871.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://krilin31.homestead.com/files/blow_up.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If a Pally Can't Solo, why am I always the only Solo Mel</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Level 30-35 I soloed Momma Mammoths, while all the Druids Medded or Kited taking twice as long to kill a Mob than me.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I love soloing evens without LoH and unuber gear as druids 10 levels above me keep asking how I'm doing it.

<br>
I once had a warrior on his way to kunark on the boats (hehe, never listen to people getting on a boat to kunark) told me a 30 paladin would get eaten alive at the crazed camp in a discussion about what levels could hunt in BB.  Well, I invited him to the camp to watch.  <br>
<br>
In my &quot;uber&quot; (hehe, some crusty with some blackened alloy and fine plate mixed in) gear and super-sweet weapon (mithril 2 hander)  I was able to show him the soloing power of a smart paladin (only pulled one, got to full life/mana before a fight, used root/heal, kept buffs up).  <br>
<br>
I stayed at that camp levels 30-35 and never used LoH once (about the only 1 week stretch where I actually did that hehe).  Even with the few times I got adds on a pull when one spawned on me.  Paladins rock.  'Nuff said. <p><center>Avethar Soulforge(retired)</center>

<br>
I have been a lurker for a long time. I have always wanted to make a paladin but never got around to actually doing so.<br>
<br>
One small misconception here.<br>
<br>
Thieves can solo to 60. It isnt efficiant. It isn't pretty. You have to know when to cut your losses and run like a gnome with a platoon of hungry trolls after him. But it can be done.<br>
<br>
I know this because with Feather before most of velious was explored I hit level 60 thief. One of my goals was to solo for xp some in every level I played. Using poisens. Good selection of targets, decent gear, (I was not at all uber either) and the lack of a self preservation instinct I soloed xp mobs with no buffs time and time again.<br>
<br>
Any class in the game can solo. It just takes knowing what your class can do. (Of course soloing with my shaman is so much more effective and fun)<br>
<br>
Anyways I just thought I would finally say hello, and try and clear up something I know to be false.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

<br>
Paladin heals look pathetic next to a cleric or even a druid at most levels until you realize that they really aren't for emergency group healing.  What they're perfect for is healing yourself back up after a fight.  <br>
<br>
You don't have to have the best possible gear or an ultra expensive fungi either.  Starting with the centi ws and bronze/fs armor I've been upgrading as I leveled and recently dropped 5k for a etched velium war lance(30/35). I was soloing fine before but this thing really hits hard now.
