I killed Faydedar a few days before that dreadful patch, and it was really a test of skill to kite him. I know some druids on my server, I won't mention names, that there is no way in hell they could kite Faydedar for more than 5 minutes. Personally, I don't think they should get their epic by spawning Faydedar and killing him that easily. There's a REASON this epic has great stats and a great effect, just because rogue epic is easier (and yields a worse item IMO) doesn't mean ours has to be just as easy. When the whole idea of getting your epic came about, the people that had them flaunted them. Now that this is so easy, I think I'll just put mine away on raids and pull out the parrying dagger or ice cream cone.<br>
<br>
And I know that some of you still trying to get Fay want me to look at your side of the coin. Well, I've been there, and even while I didn't have it I still thought Fay should NOT be triggered. <br>

Feydader to easy.</span><hr size=1> I Agree with Feltrak. Feydader was the Only mob keeping each server from being overloaded with Druid epics. Now Verant, Because of all the whiners out there, has gone and made him 100% easier. Personally I spent 5 days in TD for 8-13 hours a day camping Fey before I got lucky and he spawned. Did I complain that the camped sucked? yes, and it does, i wouldnt want to do it again, but should they have changed it? Hell No! <br>
<br>
 Keeping Fey up by kiting him was the True test of a druids skills, and now that test is gone and soon there will be tons of epics on each server instead of a handfull =/<br>
<br>
 Druids Kite, thats what we do when we solo, and we will continue to kite even if Verant tries to nerf it more, We know this, Verant knows this. So what did they do? they said fine, your going to kite, Kite a Dragon for your epic(insert evil laugh from VI here) and see how good you are at it. Could us druids be happy with that? some of us were.. but then there were the many others who knew they didnt have the skill to do it, or couldnt gather the resources in time to kill him so they whined(insert sarcastic cry here) and now these people who said they Deserved the epic even though they couldnt kill the dragon the way he was just because they put in X amount of time on the quest will have their epics.<br>
<br>
 To me it is a sad day in the Druid community to see that the druid epic has already started to fade from the awe inspiring effect that It once had to a common place item.<br>

Though he's not as elusive as bigfoot anymore he's still a tough creature to deal with. Maybe VI shouldn't have made him a trigger and should have made him spawn like any other dragon. To me, that sounds more reasonable. But to say that you want to deny your brothers and sisters the chance to build up their stats so you can &quot;flaunt&quot; a pretty piece of equipment is (IMO) immature and spoiled. For those of you that have your epic pre-patch congrats, my hat is off to you and I say, &quot;Job well done!&quot; In my eyes you are still distinguished over all those that come after you.

<br>
LOL, first this is just bullshit, i kitted fay naked with just 10 bat wings on me and some summoned food/water.. there is nothing to do, just run in big circle, keep fay in track and be sure not to overrun him too much.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Fay wasnt a test of druid's kiting ability, it was more a test of &quot;druid who have 2 pc at home, a permanent internet connection, and a lot of time to waste..&quot;<br>
<br>
The fact was fay was bugged. He was depoping for unknown reasons even while he was kitted. <br>

First, it is Faydedar. Secondly, If u camped him for that long, then u are just someone who has time to waste. Do you know there are people here who works, have a family , friends etc..? I dont see myself stoping everything because i want to sit my butt somewhere and wait.. And then, my boss calls me to know what the hell i am doing, and i answer him &quot;Sorry i am camping fay this week...&quot;..<br>
<br>
Is the druid fa quest easy now compared to some others ? Yes, definately.<br>
<br>
Is it normal ?<br>
No, it isnt. VI should make all epic quest with about the same difficulty. Mag, sk, wiz one are much harder. And this isnt normal. My opinion is that they should make them all hard (like mag one for instance) or all easy (like rogue, sham or dru one).<br>

   I just wanted to say that you get what you work for.  Shamans get an easy quest, and their epic is nice but not overly group friendly.  Mages get a horribly hard quest but an awesome pet.  Clerics get a pretty hard epic but imo one of the best effects.  If you have an easy epic you should get a mediocre effect.  If you have a hard epic you should get a really good epic.  Now druid epic effect is worse than shaman, i mean 2 minutes for a DoT and a Snare(necro spell? wonderful) is not cool exspecially since it is resisted too high hell.  Why should druids have to have it 10x as hard as shamans for a weapon that is worse?  I personally congratulated  a druid on our server who had epic prepatch because they deserved it. The quest was so bugged to all hell. Anyways i know some people feel cheated but its what had to be done for fairness.  Either that or give us a really good effect to reflect our hard quest.  Guess VI decided to make the quest easier =^) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhappyfeetfunkmaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Happyfeet Funkmaster</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://facelink.snap.com/edit/raw/rawimage/03/1047903.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/18/01 12:00:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.snap.com/edit/raw/rawimage/03/1047903.gif?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faydedar WAY too easy</span><hr size=1> Preach it gotzaa :P<br>

Sorry, that is just too, too funny. The rogue epic item WORSE than the druid epic??? What game do you play anyway? In the game we call Everquest, the rogue epic item improves the wielder's efficiency so much more than the druid epic improves its wielder's efficiency it's not even funny...<br>
<br>
Hmm, on second thought maybe it IS funny. :)<br>
<br>
Feltrak, the tone of your post and your demonstrable lack of knowledge of the mechanics of the game from a grouping/raiding perspective simply confirm to me the obvious - you are a soloing druid with little or no knowledge of the &quot;high level&quot; game. It's no wonder that you think kiting Feydedar was supposed to prove something about a druid's worthiness to hold the epic. Anyone with half a brain and an ounce of experience doing high level group/raid activities would know that a druid without their epic can be just as useful and effective to the group/raid as one with their epic. But a rogue without Ragebringer will be noticably less effective to the group/raid than the rogue with one.<br>
<br>
Please go back to kiting dorfs in BB and leave the high end game to the serious players. Thanks.<br>

U mad because u have sat ur asss for countless hours to camp faydedar and a week later they change faydedar to be a triggered spawn, let me tell something to ur bluebie ass, ur a bluebie all u have to do is sit ur ass and get XP.<br>
<br>
Now if you were playing on a PvP server u would know how fun it is to camp faydedar, with people killing your twink while u camp faydedar making ur camp impossible. This change is one of the few things Verant did that helped druids in some way...<br>

That is not a test of skill.  Fay is just as difficult as before (if not more so because of NPC aggro issues), so it still requires skill to accomplish this quest.  It's no easier than before, just less time consuming.  There is a difference.  If someone can tell me how parking a level 1 ranger on a spire and sitting for 100+ hours is skill, well, then please feel free to do so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthistlesnthorns.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thistles Nthorns</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/18/01 11:47:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WOOT</span><hr size=1> The ONLY thread I actually ENJOYED readin in this wholllllllllllllle pointless repeatative thread was Happyfeet Funkmaster  ..... hehe u r0x0r, I even like your sig =P<br>

<br>
You can not believe how pissed off it makes me when i here people say that.  Do i think our quest is to easy now, yes, am i happy they changed Faydedar, oh hell yes.  I think the whole quest is Fubared, the only thing epic about it is the camps.  I think it was tottaly wrong that &quot;Feydader was the Only mob keeping each server from being overloaded with Druid epics.&quot;  A obviously broke mob keeping people from getting there epic, that's garbage.  Look at the war epic, there aren't tons of those, why, because it's a TOUGH quest with tough mobs to kill, not because they have to camp something for hours upon hours and do all that BS that use to involve getting Fay.<br>
<br>
I'm tottaly happy everyone is getting there epics, I would like to see maybee Fay get buffed a bit and the quest to get the VS stone a bit harder but oh well<br>

In 15 days played time my bait died 3 times, once durign work hours, twice during the week end. The first week end time Fay spawned killed my bait and ran to the Iksar master that proceeded to kill him, the second time i got 24 ppl in TD fully buffed and frigging Fay despawned ... right at the moment he shoudl have been pulled.<br>
<br>
Pretty much to say i gave up back then, that was just plain ridicoulus, was not a quest and the word epic would fit in this quest only when used with camp .. Epic camp ..<br>
<br>
Sorry got better things to do in my life that check when a stupid fish spawns and how long it takes to him to get killed by a lizard monk.<br>
 <br>
Am i happy they changed the quest ? sure i am i got my epic the second night after the patch.<br>
Is fay easier than before ? not at all, he s just up whenever you like.<br>
Is the weapon that good ? well i like teh resists and the melee stats, effect is good for MM faction hunting .. just like the pet<br>
<br>
If you look up what the word "epic" means you'd discover is somethign that is very difficult to emulate ... more something like the ultimate artifact .. kind of one per server and 1000* times better of what the Nature wrath' crap effect is ... that would really make the weapon epic ..<br>
