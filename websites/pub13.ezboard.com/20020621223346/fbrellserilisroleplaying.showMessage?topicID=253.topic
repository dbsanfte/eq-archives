Emotionless features of what seemed a face of cold steel; he pondered exaclty what lay beyond his facade.  <br>
<br>
&quot;What has become of me?&quot; he thought to himself as he looked upon the clouds in the sky.  He took a handful of water and splashed it on his face.  It ran down his face, putting him into somewhat of a relaxful state, as he rested upon the hilt of his sword beside him.<br>
<br>
It was a mid-summers day outside in the forest.  Absolute silence rang over him as he rested.  &quot;Tvesh...&quot; he heard, &quot;...Tvesh S'zat...&quot; he heard again, this time turning around to where the voice was coming from.  He raised his sword in both acknowledgement and warning.  His eyes narrowed with curiosity.  &quot;Who's there?&quot; he whispered.  He saw nothing.<br>
<br>
Absolute stillness.<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
He thought back of the voice.  It was familiar to him, yet he could not match it with a face.<br>
<br>
A black silhouette stood outlined by the setting sun, a personification of beauty.  &quot;Tvesh...&quot; she called again, &quot;come, Tvesh.&quot;  Her voice was sweet, almost as of an angel if Tvesh had not believed.  He took a few steps close to get a better picture, sheathing his sword.<br>
<br>
She stepped into the light, and then it hit him.  It was almost as if mother nature has simply put a finger over her lips saying, &quot;hush&quot;.  Tvesh studied his unknown guest.  Gold armor fitted her from head to toe, shrouded with a red cloak that flapped like the midnight angel's wings in the wind, her face was slightly concealed beneath the folds of her cape.  He caught her eyes.  Dark blue eyes that were vacant, like a still, dark pool, revealing hope.  She was a paladin -- a follower of faith.  Without a word he stood there, motionless.<br>
<br>
Who was she? How is she connected to him?  What does she want?  How did she find him? The thoughts tumbled in his head.  Before he could articulate them, fear and suprise both took him over again.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you find me?&quot; he said, starting off the conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you like the back of my hand, Tvesh,&quot; she smiled, &quot;I figured you would spend the day and night alone, nonetheless in your same spot.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough games,&quot; he stated, &quot;you know if I am caught here with you I could face death.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Think not of death, Tvesh,&quot;  she said, &quot;I was hoping I could perhaps bring the opposite.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What you bring me are memories.&quot;  Tvesh was staggering, his face twisted with anguish.  His eyes pleaded with hers, but to late, mercy had died the day he had found the truth.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good ones, I hope?&quot;  She was moving in closer now, with a smile on her face.<br>
<br>
Tvesh looked somewhat back with cold eyes, emotionless, a visage of impassivity.  She began to caress his face with her hand.  He was stunned.  He looked up unto he face and glanced into a pair of sapphire eyes he knew so well.  Never inside his wildest imagination had he foreseen this ever happening.  Within him, just like a ship in uncharted waters, he stumbled blind to discover, buried so deep in his heart and mind, so deep that even he had no recollection, memories that he believed had died.<br>
<br>
<br>
A face.  A name.  A voice which once called for him.<br>
<br>
He remembered...<br>
<br>
She turned around, as if by impulse, trailing off to where she came from.  She stopped.  She turned her head around and gave Tvesh a last glance.  He stood still, studying her face trying to remember.  Everything...time, people, even life itself had seemed to just stop.  He was caught in a timeless drift bound for god knows where.  He started to run after her.  Fast.<br>
<br>
He seemed to be running for what seemed an eternity.  Time did not exist here.  By the time he had caught up with her, she had seemed to be ignoring him now....running...fast.  Reaching out, he tried to grab her arm.  He felt as if he hit nothing but air, as he saw her arm, it went up like what seemed smoked and disappeared.  He watched her, running beside her, as her body seemed to be being engulfed by nothingness.  Confused and scared all at once, Tvesh jumped out toward her, this time grabbing her whole body as if trying to keep her from evading his grasp.  He screamed out as she disappeared like smoke in front of his eyes, still in the state of ignoring him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Tvesh woke up twisting and turning.  He screamed out, &quot;NISAI!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Love, touched only once,<br>
<br>
Joy, a fleeing chance.<br>
<br>
Sorrow, a thorn clung fast,<br>
<br>
Grief, an eternity to last.<br>
<br>
Destiny, a quip of fate,<br>
<br>
Life, abound with hate.<br>
<br>
Fallen angel, broken dreams,<br>
<br>
A lost soul amidst the screams.<br>
<br>
My tears fall, a gentle rain,<br>
<br>
How I long to ease your pain.<br>
<br>
Broken angel, haunt me still,<br>
<br>
Always, shall I hear your will.&quot;<br>
<br>
