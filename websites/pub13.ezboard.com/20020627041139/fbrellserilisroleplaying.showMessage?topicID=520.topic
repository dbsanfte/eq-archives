Chapter 1.</span><hr size=1> Ashenfist stood quickly out of bed, and rushed to the side of his bed.  He picked up a small shard of tarnished metal that he used as mirror to straighten the shaggy mounds of air atop his head.  The sun had just risen, and he could feel the warmth of the sun, peaking in through his window.  Without hesitation, Ashenfist ran out in to the kitchen to find his father, hunched over a bowl of warm stew, his father looked up blankly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ashen, you slept in.  Quickly have eat yer breakfast and we be off.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ashen simply nodded and poured himself a bowl of meaty stew.  He sat down across from his father, and quietly ate his stew.  The cold air of Halas was invigorating in the morning, particularly this morning for the young boy.<br>
<br>
After a hearty breakfast Ashen's father gave his son a jagged bear's tooth, and some reinforced wolf skin armor.  The two set out for The Everfrost peaks.  It was going to be Ashen's first hunt.  He was to help feed the family when his father was away.  This was a very important day for him.<br>
<br>
Ashen was one of a large family.  He was not the oldest,  unfortunately, he was the one that would need to learn to hunt first.  His older brother, of 14 had been blinded as a child.  His family believed women were not meant to do the hunting.  And his two younger brother's were only a few years old.  It was a large burden for a 7 year old boy.<br>
<br>
Ashen and his father spent all day tracking, and hunting bears, wolves, and the odd goblin...for fun.  His father had taught him many tactics for hunting beasts, especially the trecherous goblins.  The two were still hunting, just for the learning experience, though it was now quite late.<br>
<br>
The two had finished up, his father carrying the many pelts and racks of meat they had gathered.  The night was silent as the two strode with pride toward Halas.  They were so intent on getting home and showing off their kills they hadn't heard the large man sneaking up on them.  In a single swift blow Ashen's father, Ispen was thrown forward on to his stomach.<br>
<br>
Ispen quickly jumped to his feet, shouting to Ashen.  &quot;Run Ashen!!  Run and get Bandl, fast!!&quot;  Before he could react the large man struck out at Ispen with his club, slamming the blunt oak in to his ribs.  With a gasp for Ispen fall to his side.  From the ground, Ispen grimmaced as he spoke.  &quot;Run Ashen, get away from here!  You know the tales of Martar IceBear!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ashen knew the tales...But could this really be him?  Martar was a terror.  He preyed upon Halas adventurer's, though he was barbarian himself.  Ashen could only watch in horror, affraid to move.<br>
<br>
Ispen, quickly lunged at Martar, his spear heald high, the tip thrusted toward Martar's throat.  Martar was far stronger though, and quickly ducked under the blade.  Ashen couldn't clearly see what happened now, but then he heard it.  He heard his father's blood curtling scream as Martar's blade was plunged in to his rib cage, followed by a quick twist and a jerk of the blade.  Ispen fell to the ground, tears trailing his cheeks, as his body lay in the cold snow.  Ispen's side was a mess of blood and sinew, slowly melting away at the cool snow beneath him.<br>
<br>
Ashen screamed in pain, tears welling and streaking down his cheeks as he ran to his father's side.  slumped over his father crying, pleading for him to stand.  Ispen lay motionless, only managing to stutter out a final sentence.  &quot;Live well son, take c....take care of....your family.&quot;  With that, Ispen's eyes shifted closed, his skin still warm to Ashen's touch, but cooling.<br>
<br>
Ashen cried, weasing, his heart throbbing with pain.  Time stopped.  Nothing was existant for what seemed like days.  Then that sound...The low chuckle slowly growing louder in to a deep throated laugh from Martar.  Ashen turned around to see Martar laughing at him.  Ashen burst in to a rage he'd never encountered before.  He screamed aloud, not an audible sentence, but simply raging, screaming for all he was worth.<br>
<br>
Martar cared not for a child, and decided to end it quickly.  Martar thrust himself upon Ashen, his heavy oak club arching down for the young child's forehead, intent to surely crush his skull.  Ashen, however was taken by pure instinct.  Ashen quickly grabbed his father's spear, and lunged forward under the club's reach.  He quickly rolled past Martar, his spear stabbing out to find a home in the flesh of Martar's right leg.<br>
<br>
Ashen quickly stood, drawing the spear back while Martar fell to one knee his leg spraying a deep crimson blood, out over the snow, tainting it.  Martar slowly stood, glancing up only to see the youngster charging him.  Ashen's spear was thrust at Martar's gut, Ashen hoping to slay this beast.  Martar with his wounded leg was unable to move quick enough as he straffed to his left, the tip of the spear finding the flesh of his ribs, and tearing a gash from his side.<br>
<br>
Martar fell to the ground again, his body weak with blood loss.  Martar pulled himself to his feet, as Ashen was charging again, this time Martar's wits about him, grabbed the long shaft of the spear, his other hand a tightly clenched fist met with Ashen's cheek bone, throwing him to the ground.  Ashen was stunned, and barely concious from the blow.  Martar, rather than kill the child, and risk bleeding to death, took this oppertunity to hobble off in to the darkness before Ashen recovered.<br>
<br>
Ashen slumped again over his father's corpse, which was now cold to the touch.  Ashen knew what he must do.  He slowly pry'd the armour from his father's corpse.  The orc fashioned chain armour he had gotten in Velious.  Ashen pulled the suit over himself, though still large on him, Ashen was big for his age, and Barbarian children were always large.  He picked up his father's charred shield, his orc fang necklace, and his treasured rings.  He then heaved his father's corpse over his shoulder, as he made his way back toward Halas.<br>
<br>
This night was suiting of Ashen's soul.  The light of the moon was not evident tonight.  The dark, cold, silent night was all that was present as Ashen paced through the snow, toward home.  His eyes welled with tears, but they no longer streaked his face.  He had to be strong.  He walked through the darkness, the night present as all the life which was within the peaks of Everfrost silently watched him. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63622">Xican's crappy profile</a>
