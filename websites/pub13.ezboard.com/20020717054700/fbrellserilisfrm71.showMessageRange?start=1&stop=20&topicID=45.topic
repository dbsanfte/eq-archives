Once again my guild has reserved its date for fear and I would like some clarification as to some points if a moderator is available to fill me in.<br><br>My questions stem from a few different raids.  It is my understanding that a raid leader can &quot;give&quot; mobs away to another guild that asks to come clear them.  Does the reservation system allow a guild to come and clear mobs without asking permission to do so by the current raid leader or the raid leader the next day?  Or even a single person coming up to kill off one mob?<br><br>Let me put it this way...and please let me know if its allowed:<br><br>1.  Guild A raids Fear.  Guild B asks Guild A if they can come up and take out Cazic/BG/Shissar/Golems/Draco.  Guild A says aye..come on up and join us!  Allowed or Unexceptable as per reservation rules?<br><br>2.  Guild A raids Fear.  Guild B comes in after everyone is gone and clears out the rest of the mobs without anyone being asked.  Acceptable or Unexceptable as per reservation rules?<br><br>3.  Guild A raids Fear.  Guild A leaves.  PC comes in and waits for a certain mob to spawn..and kills it.  Acceptable or Unexceptable as per reservation rules?<br><br>I ask these questions to get some clarification for the following reasons.  My guild holding its reservation, has been ready and able and willing to take out unkilled Golems for epic items that were left by the night before's raid, but 3 times now other guilds have either gotten permission to clear them, or have not gotten permission by previous raid leader and simply said they were FCFS and cleared them.  Our guild has twice gone up to take out mobs like BG and Shissar..to find they've been cleared out the night before by a guild that never had a reservation.  And tonight I ran into SS to find a DRUID camping the Shissar spawn for his &quot;friend&quot;, long after the previous raid had left.  the Shissar hadn't even spawned yet.<br><br>I dont know how many dissapointed people I've seen now that became that way simply because the CHANCE to obtain the item they need for their epics have been taken from them.<br><br>A simple change in the reservation for the plane would suffice:<br><br>Raid by: &quot;guild&quot;<br>Raid Date: &quot;date&quot;<br>Raid Time: &quot;start time&quot;<br>Raid Intentions:  &quot;we plan to clear all epic mobs for those people that waited patiently for their chance to get what they need...and we are very able to do it&quot;  We will NOT be attempting Cazic Thule.  We WILL be killing the Golems Draco etc...<br><br>This would allow everyone to see what a guild  plans; what that guild intends to do...and to let the next guild raiding fear know that Cazic will still be up and ready to be taken down.  Do this for 5 days (I believe the spawn time of CT).  And you now have plenty of time for &quot;Guild b&quot; to post that they will be entering Fear to take down CT on this date as nobody for the 5 days after that will be attempting to take him down.  This will not only speed up CT killing, but make everyone happy that they were able to get the chance to get what they wanted without having &quot;guild b&quot; head into the plane and IMO (and many others opinions) steal mobs not belonging to them.<br><br>I can understand Cazic Thule being taken down by a guild that is able.  Or a plane cleared totally if there was no reservaction that night.  But to have a reservation following a raid and to have mobs you WILL kill taken out before you get the chance and have to wait at least 2 weeks again for is IMO (and many others opinions)..not right and needs to be addressed.<br><br>&quot;Permission&quot; to come and clear anything that a guild doesn't kill in a reservable zone is basically throwing the reservation system out the window.  We are not allowed to hold more then one raid in fear every 2 weeks.  But a guild is certainly allowed to go up and clean out what they wish to &quot;after hours&quot; as far as I can see.  Every 2 weeks a guild is LUCKY if they get the single day when the mobs spawn that they need, but if they were killed by a guild without a reservation the night prior then whats the point of having a reservation?  <br><br>It comes down to this.  &quot;Thank you sir for your reservation for your car rental.  I know you planned this trip for a while now.  You went out and got all these people to come with you and hopefully see the infamous dodo bird.  And you hope to have a good time.  But unfortunatly someone came in last night and took ALL the cars away...too bad...go home.&quot;<br><br>This is NOT a rant...I would really like REAL answers to this problem as I know our guild is not the only one that has had this happen to many times. <br><br>Khuamak Zek<br>Proud Officer of Da Skurge<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utwiggietymberwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twiggie Tymberwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Board Moderator</font><br><font color=#A0B0E0>&#60;Silent Redemption&#62;</font></span><br>  Posts: 2818<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/4/02 6:02:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fear FCFS rules...what are they please</span><hr size=1> 1, 2, and 3.

Its about armor and epic items.  I have a list a mile long for people that need their sk blade or shaman tear or wizard oil..etc.  I personally attempt to get those that have been on that list longest their opportunity to get the item.  Most of the time their opportunity is non existant due to spawn times.  The other times the opportunity was taken from them by another guild that feels its members have more rights to the spawn.<br><br>&quot;The raiding system was never about epic mobs&quot;...fine..isnt it time it was changed?  Or do some guilds have the rights to get what they need first and the others are too inferior to be considered?  We're not peasants.

It is almost unheard of to find an entire plane poached, and some golems dolive from raid to raid, though typicaly not long.<br><br>There is no way to quantify who is more or less deserving of an epic component, and so no real way to distribute the golems, or for that matter the mini bosses in Hate, in a way that does also lead to the total disregard of the reservation system.

Someone killing the temple mobs *last night* would not interfere at all with having the temple spawned by time you got to it.  The only way is if they had killed the temple after 7 am this morning.  Any armor mobs killed in the temple before 7 am this morning would have easily repopped by time you got to them. <p><table><td><img src="http://members.aol.com/twiggiebrell/jaradissig.jpg"></td><td><TABLE STYLE="filter:GLOW(color=blue,strength=#+1)"  ><font color=white>Jaradis Stormcaller – Oracle of Winter - Enemy to all of Velious<br>Twiggie Tymberwolf - 52nd Wanderer - Friend to Dragon and Dwarves<br>Brell Serilis Server</font></table><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21764">Stats and Gear</a></td></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uliseutdubard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LiseutDuBard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/5/02 7:00:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=45.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Fear FCFS rules...what are they please</span><hr size=1> Well, my question is about PoS.  If my guild were to reserve the zone for a 2 day period, does this reserve us the right to all spawns in the zone including the enchanter book that drops there?  Unfortunatly an enchanter outside the raid got a port up to the zone during our last raid and looted the book actaully while one of our chanters was purchasing the key needed to enter the quest hall to get the book.  This was on the second day of the raid.  I understand that under VI rules this is allowed  but does it violate the reservation system.

If you are scheduling your raids according to pop times of mobs, then they should be up when you get there or spawn during your raid.  During the raid the zone is yours to try what mobs are up.  After the raid is over the zone is FcF until the killing of mobs intereferes with the next days raids (not that it would stop most people from killing stuff for epic items anyways).  <br><br>If your planning to kill golems yuor best bet is to plan raids a week from their verified death or CT death.
