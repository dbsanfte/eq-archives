<br>
This is not a voting thread.  No votes will be passed on what FCFS means, nor will it ever be voted on.  Your interpretation of FCFS may differ from others, but remember that the basic tenet of FCFS is respsect and should be a fundamental in it's application.<br>
<br>
That being said, the topic for today is the system of spawn organization known as First Come, First Serve.<br>
<br>
First Come, First Serve (FCFS), is an extension of the classic free for all system.  In it, spawns are not reserved or able to be held over a long term period of time.  Basically, the first group to a spawn gets to do it; those that come afterwards back off out of respect to the group that got there first.  This differs from the classic ffa in that in ffa, spawn clipping (taking a spawn while the original group is buffing/moving/cr'ing), cohing past the group, and other similiar tactics are present.  FCFS is characterized by respect of the group that got there first and are thus entitled to the spawn.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the conflict arises in deciding what constitutes &quot;being first&quot;.<br>
<br>
Many situations are to be considered such as...<br>
<br>
- The person who &quot;claims&quot; a spawn in /shout (particularily Lodizal and other one spawn mobs) and then begins gathering forces there.<br>
<br>
- The person who &quot;claims&quot; a spawn in /shout with people on the way.<br>
<br>
- The person who &quot;claims&quot; a spawn with part of their force present and the rest on the way.<br>
<br>
- The person who &quot;claims&quot; a spawn with all their force present but is contested with another group that has their force partially or fully present.<br>
<br>
Any definition of &quot;being first&quot; should include simple answer and reasoning to these questions.  <br>
<br>
Your thoughts and comments are, as always, appreciated.  Thanks.<br>

<br>
Anything else is up for speculation.  We all know how long it takes for people to get organized, even the big, mean Uber_SR.<br>
<br>
The key here is that you can't legislate courtesy.  Sometimes people will see differently, and the best thing you can do to try and work through that is to talk to the other party.  If you dont get the mob, move on.  If you do get the mob, be thankful.  Either way, there's 40+ other Ubermobs to be killed, most of which have been up for days on end.<br>
<br>
I set up a Hole raid awhile back to get Ulver his epic piece.  I didn't check the intentions board, as I knew the Hole wasn't reservable.  When we showed up, there was another guild there.  We moved on to another zone.<br>
<br>
Was Ulver upset?  Of course.  Did he bitch and complain?  Never.  There's a significant difference between being dissappointed because a raid you were excited about can't go on and taking out your frustrations on the people around you.<br>
<br>
You can't make rules for that.  People will react to situations differently, and no amount of discussion is going to change what they feel is an appropriate response. <p>Ganon Stormwynd <BR>

<br>
I think this most accurately describes fcfs (to me) but that brings up the question... What if someone tried to kill a mob like Lodizal, and failed... decided to try again but got sniped... Would the people who sniped Lodizal be wrong ? According to this definition, No. Do the majority of the people who play on brell think its wrong... probably. I know i would be pretty pissed off if we died fighting some random uber mob, and another raid moved in and killed it. Legal, technically... morally right, no. <br>

I believe that the group that is partially gathered has no right to claim a camp.  I've been on the receiving end of this claim far too many times, not just for large single unreservable targets, but for things in Karnor's.<br>
<br>
To site an example, a group taking the hand room that sits in a corner for half an hour or more while he gathers his people where we have our numbers and classes ready to go in and take the camp. <p>Dauros 54th Enchanter of Ethos<BR>

What's the point to this discussion? If nothing is going to be finalized, what's the point?<br>
<br>
At the very least, if this is just some normal everyday discussion, like the recent Ragefire discussion, please don't title it like it's a formal discussion that's actually meant to solve something besides someone's personal opinion.<br>

<br>
<br>
I still remember a while back where Sheebla claimed shroomz king for more than 2 hours looking for the people to do it with. I dont think she ever got the people for it and did in fact just block the spawn. I can see it from both ways, when you ask people to come it would be nice to know if the spawn infact was free when you got there. But I would never swear at anyone that got all the people for it first if they moved down ahead of me. In a sense what sheebla did wasnt wrong but if anyone had decided to move down before her it wouldnt have been wrong either.<br>
<br>
Another case I can remember was the Ragefire we did recently for Dubin. Since Ragefire had not spawned in 48 hours we booked FGs 2 times the day after to make sure we didnt partially push anyones raids(Look at the rant board).<br>
Ragefire did infact spawn and we started setting up the raid informing people. We set the raid for 3 hours later cause we knew that the rest of the people would be there for it then. About 1 hour before we had sheduled the FG and Ragefire slaying, Nindyilied cleric in guardian revelation zones in and state that she claims Ragefire. She didnt have any people present that could kill it for her and I told her that we had booked FGs for that day and intended to slay Ragefire aswell. She did curse a bit at us for doing so but I dont think there was anything wrong with it.<br>
<br>
Theese are the only two episodes I can remember where the FcFs rules have been a bit on the edge. Meaning where I had to discuss with people, what they were doing was fair or not.<br>

There are tons of shades of gray, which we are seeing a particular case in rants - when you talk about groups recovering or waiting on 2 ppl or what not.  <br>
<br>
Personally, if a group &quot;looks&quot; like they have died and are trying to regroup OR they have a majority there and are just waiting for maybe 5 ppl and it is within a reasonable time, I will pass and go elsewhere.  I can't imagine forcing myself onto someone else's party.  There is tons in this game to do than to bully people.  Of course, I'm not loot centered so this is fairly easy for me to /shrug at.<br>
<br>
So, to me, there are two definitions really when we talk about FCFS..the technical one and the one that covers &quot;the grey areas&quot;.<br>
<br>

Hit a bingo here, Ganon.  Disappointment in not getting your way or getting your hopes up to be let down, normal.  Being and acting like an ass and ranting about not getting your way going out to drag someone's name through the mud, spoiled brat.<br>

<br>
I can appreciate what you're saying. And I don't have a problem with that at all. But what I was getting at was that if it's gonna be a &quot;shoot the shit&quot; pointless discussion, then let's separate what a &quot;casual&quot; discussion looks like from what we typically consider discussions that actually matter.<br>
<br>
As it stands, this whole topic could be erased and not a single person on the server would be any different. Or, everyone on the server could reply, everyone would probably have very different opinions, (as Goat mentioned) and again, everyone would walk away and it would be NO different.<br>
<br>
Since FCFS is about respect, and it IS about respect, what difference does all the rest of it matter? Some people will play with honor and respect as they always have. Some people will play what the feel is politically correct and/or as much as they can get away with, and finally some people will play as they always have - no respect for anyone.<br>
<br>
Us discussing FCFS is not going to change that.<br>

<br>
I was part of a group that kill K'Dar tonight.  From the first tell, to the pulling of the dragon, it was well over an hour.<br>
<br>
Because we took an excessive time to get setup, I feel it would have been within another group's right to attempt the dragon if they had the numbers there before us.<br>
<br>
It's not about the first person to see a mob.  Not even the first person to have 6 people there.  The first person to have a raiding party there is the one.<br>
<br>
I don't consider a person at zone &quot;claiming&quot; something in ooc to be a valid claim.  If you're not at the spawn, or on your way, it's not stealing for another group to head down if they're ready.<br>
<br>
If you fail an attempt on a random spawn mob &amp; there's another group ready to attempt it, they should be able to do that.  I have no problem with a group that's ready killing Lodizal after another group gets wiped out by him.  Raid crews don't just materialize out of thin air.  It takes time to setup.<br>
<br>
If someone engages the Ancient Cyclops in S Ro, and dies to him, do you consider it stealing if someone else engages him after that &amp; kills him?  Why is it different for Dragons?<br>
<br>
If I'm part of a raid on K'Dar that fails, and there's another group ready to try him, they deserve that shot.  I had my try &amp; messed it up.  If they decide to back off &amp; let me have it, that's incredibly nice of them, but not required.  I don't own the mob.  Nor does anyone else.  I didn't invite them on my raid, because I'm interested in keeping the loot distribution small.  They're interested in the dragon because they want the items he drops.<br>
<br>
We're both greedy, and after loot.  Sure, I'd rather have it all for myself, but that's not being realistic, or fair.  So I'll either merge raids, or I'll take a shot at it on my own.  If I succeed, woot, I get all the loot for myself, and too bad for the other guys.  If I fail, bummer.  They get the loot.<br>
<br>
I dislike the attitude that spawns are &quot;owned&quot; by someone.  If you have the group that can kill a mob there first, great.  Go do it.  If not, move aside so that someone else can.  It works both ways.  I might want to do something, but not be able to pull it off.  Another group takes it.  Bummer, maybe next time.  I'm not going to rant, they've got just as much right as me to try something. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udauros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dauros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/27/01 8:08:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: What is First Come, First Serve?</span><hr size=1> Dexn,<br>

My original response to your response was that there doesn't have to be a meaning to everything, not that FCFS matters at all.  If a conversation does turn to mean something other than what it started to be then there will be a line drawn somewhere to indicate it.  As it stands, this is just s discussion right now.<br>

Yes you are right when you say that FCFS is about respect...an unpoliced FCFS is just that because it is left to the people participating as to who is right, who is wrong, and ultimately who has the right of way.<br>
<br>
The only issue at hand is who is going to determine if the right call was made or if the wrong person got the right of way...most importantly, how do you put rules in for a FCFS and then enforce them and ultimately punish those that break them. <p>Dauros 54th Enchanter of Ethos<BR>

<br>
The more people that are not extended simple courtesies or consideration will become more people whom extending a simple courtesy or consideration will be hard for.  None of this would be an issue if people merely clarified their intents and/or asked for their shot, irregardless of whether or not you thought you were in the right, or were riteous in your actions.<br>

<br>
How long between attempts at a named FCFS mob should a group be allotted before another group moves in? Certainly if a group is taking six hours to regroup that's unreasonable for them to 'claim' said mob for that amount of time. And certainly a half hour is reasonable. Where's the cutoff? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udauros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dauros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/27/01 11:44:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Remember how you would like to be treated.</span><hr size=1> One way to look at it is the mob spawn time *shrug* but that's sometimes not a good way to look at things.<br>
<br>
If we introduce more rules into the system of FCFS, doesn't it kind of defeat the purpose of FCFS itself?  Ultimately the more rules you make the less FCFS it becomes....again, I think it all boils down to common courtesy. <p>Dauros 54th Enchanter of Ethos<BR>

<br>
In other words, basic courtesy. You zone into Ice Clad to do Lodizel and see a couple groups buffing for it. You wish them luck and go on to the next thing.<br>
<br>
You zone into COM and ask in OOC &quot;Are the lords taken?&quot; and wait for a reply and go from there.<br>
<br>
You zone into Kedge to see if the names are up. You ask in OOC if anyone in zone is planning on doing them. You receive no reply and bring your group in to do them. 30 minutes later someone pipes up and says &quot;HEY! We were planning on doing them!&quot;. You explain that you asked if anyone was doing them, and are very sorry from crossing them up (then continue killing Phinny or whoever since you were there first).<br>
<br>
I can't believe this topic needs to be &quot;discussed&quot;. Didn't you all learn this in kindergarten with blocks?<br>

I don't feel that mobs &quot;belong&quot; to anyone.  Say I'm in Cobalt Scar, &amp; I discover K'Dar is up.  Nobody else is in zone, and he just popped.  I'm the only person to know.  I start recruiting to kill him, &amp; 5 mins later, there are 6 DG people in zone.<br>
<br>
Someone from SR ports in, &amp; notices he's up.  SR starts getting people together.  Thirty mins later, DG is still just 6 people.  We have another 12 on the way, but they'll be another 30 mins or so.  SR is there in force, &amp; is ready to take the dragon.<br>
<br>
If we're unable to take the dragon, &amp; SR is, why can't they give it a shot?  It's rude of me to demand that SR leave, simply because I was there first.  SR had the raid crew there first, they can give it a shot.  Let's say they try &amp; fail.  They're doing CR.  The rest of my crew arrives.  I feel perfectly justified in having my try now.  SR's on CR, they're not prepared to engage the dragon, but my group is.<br>
<br>
Mobs aren't owned by anyone.  If you have the people there to do it, go for it.  If someone else was there first, let them try.  If they're not prepared to try, then they weren't really there first.<br>
<br>
If two parties form up independently at the same time, then the first to engage (not kite) the mob are the ones that kill it.  If the first group fails, the second is free to try it. Competition is a good thing.  It doesn't have to be about right/wrong.  If I compete with someone &amp; lose, so be it.  I gave it my best shot, &amp; perhaps I'll be better prepared, or invite more people next time.<br>
<br>
It's not being rude, it's simply a different form of courtesy.  The courtesy states: &quot;It's not appropriate for me to claim something that I'm not prepared to do.  If you are there &amp; prepared to do it, you have that right.&quot;<br>
<br>
I find people sitting at a zone claim &quot;claiming&quot; a spawn to be very rude.  In recognizing that I don't own a spawn, that spawn cannot be stolen from me, it never belonged to me in the first place.<br>
<br>
I remember the night I got the Pawduster.  When my group entered Karnor's, someone was claiming hands.  He wasn't there, so we went in.  Two hours pass by...  The guy still didn't have his group together.<br>
<br>
IMO, nothing less than a full raid crew ready to engage can claim a spawn as theirs.  Don't claim it, just go do it.  If you kill the mob in question, it's obviously yours.  If you can't kill it, or aren't ready it, it's obviously not yours yet, now is it? <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugaramebonhands.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garam Ebonhands</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 302<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/27/01 1:01:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Remember how you would like to be treated.</span><hr size=1> These aren't rules that are being introducing, they are guildlines.  This is an attempt to get a feeling of what everyone or what &quot;Brell Society&quot; thinks is FCFS.  There isn't going to be a vote because there is nothing to vote on. <br>
<br>
In Darkguard we were going to kill Phinny.  We got 6 people headed that way, checked the intentions board (RIP) and found another group was going to do it.  I was first to arrive at Unrest, saw that they had 3-4 people already there so we made the decision to go somewhere else and kill something else.  Yes, we could have mobilized before them, invis'd in and killed Phinny, but why?  We can always go back and kill him another time.  FCFS involves a little bit of respect and a lot of flexiblity.  It's just as easy to move onto something else and come back another time.<br>
<br>
The other thing with FCFS is that it's not about beating the system.  If in the above example if we invis'd in and surgically struck Phinny, we would have technically been in the right.  However, we knew they were there to do Phinny, we could have asked to join forces, but instead we just moved on.  The key to this is:  We didn't think we &quot;owned&quot; the mob.  So it was no skin off our back to go do something else.  &quot;We didn't get him this time, well we will get him next time&quot;.<br>
<br>
A lot of people talk about the time it took to get raiders together and buff up.  They think that this investment deserves the return of killing the phat lewt monster.  However, when they find that they can't for whatever reason kill that particular mob they generally just quit and go their seperate ways.  The fault here lies with the raid organizer.  You have 12-24 people itching to kill something, having invested an hour at the least, find something else for them to do.  Adune had planned a sky raid, when certain personnel failed to show, he tossed out alternatives.  So instead, we all went to Chardok, had an awesome raid and killed the king.  Instead, of 24 people losing 2 hours each, 19 people went to Chardok and had a kick ass time.<br>

 My reasoning is simple, it clears out many of the grey areas reguarding times, claims,and repeat attempts.<br>
 It is the way the game was designed right down to the moss snakes.<br>
   We have a reputation of being civil on Brell in an uncivil environment,thats quite a statement considering the nature of the game is survival of the fittest.<br>
  Have i been dumped on by another group? yes<br>
  I have also moved on, theres plenty to kill out there now.<br>
  Do i want to have to check the board for any move i make?<br>
 No. Do i think i can and do respect others? yes.to a fault<br>
  I hate grey areas, it leaves too much room for Manipulation, and control freaks <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthorondar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorondar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/27/01 1:14:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/5539/cyclone2.jpg width=100 height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Stupid hypothetical situation, Adun(e)</span><hr size=1> I'm sure that if you were there in CS and found Kelorek to be up and were recruiting, and then started to see a force of SR folks porting in, you would ask if they were planning on Kelorek, or if they were on their way to WW to go do dragons, or DN or Temple of Veeshan... would you not?<br>
<br>
Or perhaps you would /ooc or /shout that you were gathering folks to do the CS dragon.  Then perhaps they would respond and say, hey we got a group here for it and we'd like to attmept it right now, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do you mind?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  And then a dialogue would ensue.  I trust and have enough faith in SR to open a dialogue and figure things out that would lead to a viable solution to everyone.<br>
<br>
I doubt in your hypothetical situation that you would continue buffing and trying to get your folks there faster so you could pull Kelorek faster than SR and kill him in front of them without telling them your intentions, nor do I feel they would attempt to pull Kelorek in front of you without saying something in /ooc or /shout stating their intention.<br>
<br>
It is because of this type of consideration for other players that Guilds get along with each other, or do not get along with each other.  The willingness to cooperate and consider each others motives and open the lines of communications first, rather than just take what you want irregardless of the folks that are already there.<br>
