I'm currently lvl 7 and i've been trying all different camps i run across.  I find that its better for me to move on when i find camps where the mobs are so close to each other i cant pull singles.  I'm mainly talking about the static camps like those little goblin or bandit camp sites.  I've tried all different types of angles pulling with that ice snare(forget the name of it) spell.  I was even teamed with a Wizard and another Theurgist and we kept getting slaughtered because we couldnt get singles out of the camp.  Eventually we gave up and just starting picking off wanderers.  Does anybody have a harmony type spell?  Or a FD skill where they can maybe pull singles away?  Any tricks or tips you can pass down to a young Theurgist?<br>
<br>
A few other unrelated newbie questions if anybody can answer.....<br>
<br>
1) Can anybody give a link to a good map for the Theurgist realm(that might include landmarks like bindpoints or small villages)?<br>
<br>
2) In terms of tasks, i'm really having a tough time locating a mob a guard tells me to kill, for example i was told to find and kill a Red Dwarf Bandit north of Camelot.  I searched for about 2 hours and didnt find one red bandit, but i did find other things with red as part of its name in a general vicinity of each other.  I kept wondering if placeholders exist in this game after thoroughly searching the whole area with no luck, do they?  <br>
<br>
3) Is there an easy way to find out if there is a healer nearby?  I know typing /where healer doesnt work.  Taking a horse all the way to Camelot just so i can get healed stinks, and i'm hanging out near where i was first created in some small village far away that apparently has no healer but should :P <br>
<br>
4) Is the loot pretty much balanced that you've noticed?  What i mean is do blue mobs all drop generally about the same?  Or have you noticed some drops being much much better than others?  <br>
<br>
5) What is up with magic items?  I've got a magic necklace(cant remember name) and cape(Rancid Fur cape) that just say lvl 7 'magic' as its description.  How can i tell what they do?  <br>
<br>
<br>
I think thats about it.  The book i received with the game doesnt help me much at all.  They need to put a website out that expands on the basic book, isntead of forcing us to go out and buy a strategy guide.  Other than that, i'm really enjoying the game ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/12/01 8:24:53 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anybody have some advice on breaking up camps?</span><hr size=1> <b><i>Anybody have some advice on breaking up camps?   preferably for a Theurgist solo?</b></i><br>
<br>
I'm not the Theurgist expert here, but I think you do have a short-term area mesmerize spell you can use to buy you a little time, as well as a snare/root you can use to hold enemies briefly.  There are a number of sorcerer techniques and exploits you can use to clear camps, but for theurgists, I believe you're stuck with either brute force or dragging to guards (if possible).  Perhaps Scirocco is aware of more theurgist exploits.<br>
<br>
<i><b>1) Can anybody give a link to a good map for the Theurgist realm(that might include landmarks like bindpoints or small villages)?</b></i><br>
<br>
I haven't seen many maps out there.  Check <a href=http://www.daatlas.com/>www.daatlas.com</a>, I know they have some sketches of the Albion zones.<br>
<br>
<b><i>2) In terms of tasks, i'm really having a tough time locating a mob a guard tells me to kill</b></i><br>
<br>
You have to kill exactly what the guard tells you.  Sometimes, the guard will even try to fool you by giving a false direction, or so it seems.  Overall I think the kill tasks are very buggy, and not really worth the effort for a good solo class.<br>
<br>
<b><i>3) Is there an easy way to find out if there is a healer nearby?</b></i><br>
<br>
There are healers where there are trainers and every bind point (that I've seen).<br>
<br>
<b><i>4) Is the loot pretty much balanced that you've noticed? What i mean is do blue mobs all drop generally about the same? Or have you noticed some drops being much much better than others?</b></i><br>
<br>
It's not the same.  Certain types of NPCs will have special loot; others will never have special loot.  Some have tons of coin, others have very little coin.  Some have lots of annoying "junk" loot, others don't.  Know your NPC.<br>
<br>
<b><i>5) What is up with magic items? I've got a magic necklace(cant remember name) and cape(Rancid Fur cape) that just say lvl 7 'magic' as its description. How can i tell what they do?</b></i><br>

If you are in a gorup it will take alot of training.<br>
<br>
/sighs<br>
<br>
Now I know how EQ necros feel. ;) Actually can do LESS with a group. lol<br>
<br>
Anyway.  Here is how I do it:<br>
<br>
If solo super easy.  Pick the lowest level critter (quickest to pick off)  Swarm pets. I use at least 2 air here for one simple reason. It is imperitive that the creature you are attacking can't move far.  The other stuff in camp will agro on your pets.  BUT if the mob of them never gets within agro range of YOU they won't agro once the pets die.  <br>
<br>
So I send in enough pets to finish off the lowest level, running off a bit if need be.   Sometimes you'll get one critter chasing you after your target dies, so just sick more pets on that one and bang, they are dead too. Nice camp and grou bonus this way.<br>
<br>
Ifyou are ina group you can use the same tactic. The hard part is keeping hte bone headed tanks and trigger happy casters from doing ANYTHING.  If you can convince them to sit far away on their buts while you kill one you can then drag any adds to them for mop up.  Rinse, repeat.  Easy way to break even a very hard camp.<br>
<br>
I've used this tactic on the Filidh camp near the Prydwyn Keep Bridge.  Works like a charm. :) I can even kill the named mob in the very dead center of the camp this way. <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

About Red Dwarf Bandits....<br>
<br>
There are some just out of Camelot's North Gate.   Run west towards the hills and you'll see a guard tower and a lone gaurd(jergenson or something).   Just east from the tower a bit is a campfire with dwarves around it.  If you kill off the brawlers, and other ones milling about, a Red Dwarf bandit will show up.<br>
<br>
Spot two.. Cross the double bridge.  On the north side, head east along the water and up into a thicket.  You'll find a shaman there and Red Bandit Dwarves.  If you open a dialog with the shaman and follow it thru to the end, she'll summon a couple pets and if you are along and level 20 or less, you're going to probably die.   The pets spawn on you and unless they are grey, you're not going to have much of a chance.<br>
<br>
There are also random dwarves that appear on the road from the bridge to the gaurd tower where the spiders are.   These are very infrequent pops, so not worth bothering with.<br>

Unless the mobs are grouped (yes, mobs are sometimes grouped in DAoC...just like players are), only the one that was attacked should come. when it does, QUICKLY cast an earth pet and buff it with damage buff. With any luck at all, the earth pet will take agro when the ice pet dies.  <p>Geneze Angelfyre <BR>

<br>
The above-described method for handling camps is ideal, except I always go for the highest mob in the camp I can handle (not the lowest).  Just swarm it, move back a bit and sit.  Be ready to run if the snarling pack of mobs and elementals comes near you.  If it doesn't, and the mobs aren't linked, then the mobs aggroed on your elemental will just turn away when the elemental dies.  You WANT to go for the camps where you get camp and group bonuses...they can be more than half the XP award!<br>
