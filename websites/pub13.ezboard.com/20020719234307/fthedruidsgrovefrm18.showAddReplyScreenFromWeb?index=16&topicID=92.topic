<br>
You mean to say, it's useful for everything EXCEPT large single-target raids.  That's a lot more than soloing.  Mana-free and slot-free root is far more useful than you might think.  Certainly something you will <b>notice</b> in your gameplay, as opposed to stats, which you will never notice unless you look at those pretty green numbers to stroke your ego.  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt><br>
<br>
<b><i>in the high end game you cant afford to be sitting there with junk in a spot when you could have any one of a huge number of items to boost resists, hp, mana.</b></i><br>
<br>
You can't "afford" it?  What exactly you are doing in the high end game nowadays that requires all the special items?  Last I remember, druids can pretty easily hide from many AEs and melee, and mostly do spot healing, weak nuking (on non immune NPCs), a buff here and there, and of course play taxi before and after.  Has this changed dramatically?  If not, a little mana or resist here or there isn't going to mean much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/11/02 10:08:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=18>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of the Best: NECK</span><hr size=1> actually no, i said exactly what i meant.  and i know exactly how useful the warden symbol is, since i use one myself.  the long casting time makes it unfavorable to use for CC if you are grouping, not to mention the shorter average duration compared to the lvl 56 root.  as a root to stop runners its also unfavorable due to that long casting time, and the mana:damage efficiency of our 56 root is excellent for a small fast nuke.<br>
<br>
even soloing, i find myself using 56 root much more than warden symbol, mainly because with the symbol i <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> notice</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> i often lose more med time than i feel its worth.  one other thing i <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> notice</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is that it takes me slightly longer to kill things, since you are doing 10 dd instead of 190, and the 56 root damage adds up even after a couple roots.<br>
<br>
when it comes to hp, mana, resists, you can never have enough.  and that extra 10 saves may mean the difference between life or death when dealing with some of the nasty ae's we encounter.  an extra hundred mana can mean a cure on someone to save their life, and thus help prevent the raid from failing.  or even an extra root to get a mob off a cleric/enc and onto the tanks beating on it =) <p>-K<br>

<br>
Note the underlined words.  This is the same argument the stat worshippers used back in the day.  While theoretically, those things CAN and MAY affect your performance, how many times can you affirmatively say they DID they have an effect?<br>
<br>
<b><i>the long casting time makes it unfavorable to use for CC if you are grouping, not to mention the shorter average duration compared to the lvl 56 root.</b></i><br>
<br>
Things must have changed, because I remember root having a variable duration, and often breaking long before the maximum duration.  Each break, or resist, means you waste ANOTHER 75 mana or whatever it is.  That may not seem like much, but it does add up.  With an item, you can simply chain cast it and have a basically guaranteed forever root for zero mana.  Another bonus for the low level root is the super-low damage, which helps to prevent triggering of the summoning code.<br>
<br>
Also you're forgetting that items don't gobble up your recast time, and thus they can actually be faster when you want to cast a spell right before or after.  So let's say you want to cast root and then immediately winged death, with the root spell it would be 1.8 + 2.5 = 4.3 seconds for the root portion versus the casting time for the item alone, which I think is 4.0 (but correct me if I'm wrong).<br>
<br>
By using items and bypassing the recast time delay, you are also removing the period of vulnerability associated with recast time.  Unless game mechanics have changed, you are completely unable to cast a spell after you complete a spell and are awaiting the recast delay.  A lot can happen in 2.5 seconds, and it's frustrating to have to sit there and just wait.  With an item effect, you can rest assured that you can instantly cancel it at any time and start that heal on your dying group member.<br>
<br>
The items that give you clickable root and snare are far more useful than you think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uiisbliss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iisbliss</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 5:07:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=20>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of the Best: NECK</span><hr size=1> Well, Silver Charm would be my top choice, but since I dont have the right faction, the next best is Dreadgazer.<br>

<br>
an intelligent person will alternate their items and spells, no matter what root they use.  so if you use spell root, you do not lead off with WD next, because that would be stupid.  instead you would lay on drones, then WD/Boro, then scim if you have it.  with that setup you totally negate any recast time on your spells and allow for continuous casting.<br>
<br>
roots do have a random duration, however a lower level root has a lower AVERAGE duration, which is why we see symbol root breaking most probably in half the time as spell root.  also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.  if you meditate even for 24 seconds you regain all the mana spent on one 56 root plus some extra (counting only meditation mana regen).  besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?  with the warden symbol, you can combine casting and medding with careful timing so that there is no break in either your root OR your meditation.  if you are going to use the symbol for your root, at least do so with a little forethought so that you maximize your mana gain while you minimize your mana expenditure.<br>
<br>
im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.  are you saying that one should stick with the symbol even if items such as the silver charm are available to them?  because thats just silly and shortsighted. <p>-K<br>

<br>
They have a lower maximum duration, for sure, and that translates to a lower average duration.  I will also grant you that the higher level roots have a lower initial chance to resist.  But what is your evidence that, at each tick, the chance to break is higher for the lower level root?<br>
<br>
<b><i>also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.</b></i><br>
<br>
Well technically, you don't need to lose any meditation ticks when you use the item.  Just play the "canni dance" with it.<br>
<br>
<b><i>besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?</b></i><br>
<br>
If you need something to absolutely stay put, that is almost a 100% sure way unless (a) it summons (and even then it will take a while) or (b) you are extremely unlucky and get a long series of resists combined with an early break.  If you wait until it breaks with a regular root, it will have moved by the time you recast.<br>
<br>
<b><i>im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.</b></i><br>
<br>
1) Stats mean diddly on a per-item basis.  They're there mainly to make you feel good about yourself and not feel guilty about the time you just wasted getting them.  You will not notice the difference on even an uber item just because of stats.  Only in the aggregate (over many items) do stats mean anything, and the effect is still subtle.<br>
<br>
2) You will notice effects that are useful, because they affect your gameplay.<br>
<br>
3) Therefore, useful effects make an item far better than a no-effect, stat-laden item. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 10:36:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best of the Best: NECK</span><hr size=1> <b>Just play the "canni dance" with it.</b><br>

<br>
effects only make a particular item like the warden symbol better in SOME situations.  to ignore all other situations and continue in the same gear setup as you do in others is ignorant and lazy.  like those people who consider resist gear unneccessary for dragon raiding, you do yourself and your guild/group a disservice when you do not optimize yourself for the situation at hand.<br>
<br>
you go ahead and continue to wear your warden symbol full time.  i will continue to wear my charm and swap in the symbol only when i need it.  i am content with my &quot;pretty stats&quot; and the knowledge that i am optimizing my potential, and living longer too =)<br>

The added resists your gonna get with another neck piece instead of Tunares symbal is negligible in terms of added effectiveness.  The only thing your really getting is personal satisfaction in the numbers of that extra few pts of resist or whatever, which as a whole doesnt mean much.  Nobody really said much about swapping, since i believe Kalinn, your the one who stated that Tunares symbol was garbage for anything but soloing.  Personally, i think it has its uses in groups as well as possibly big mobs, but every druid does different things in groups.  I know my mana tends to go down pretty fast if i'm rooting alot of things, and a mana free version of that would be nice to have.  I also think root durations, until you get the 56 root, arent that far apart.  I'm sure the Tunare symbol root can hold as long as 44 root(whatever its called) on many occasions.  I've heard people state their able to get numerous lumi staff blasts in using tunare symbol root without it breaking sometimes.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 1:44:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> One thing i forgot to add is i'm sure we've been in situations where we're lom from maybe root parking, and trying to med to get enough mana for that next root or snare.

<br>
Once again, this neclace is a Godsend for soloing.  I'm sorry to hear Karana worshipers got the short end of the stick.  Maybe you could get a necklace with Invoke Lightning or Gate or something on it.  I know I would be upset if I didn't have access to this item.  Maybe this could be another thread?  I'm sure there are some good ideas out there.<br>

<br>
On the contrary, debate is what makes this board interesting (for some).  I know I would much rather read detailed pro/con arguments about whether X or Y is better over simple "use X it r0x0r" type posts.  Scirocco's initial post even invites debate, for this reason.  If it worries you that people are challenging your conclusions and assumptions, you could always concede the argument by ignoring it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unuviancaelestis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nuvian Caelestis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/bosses/hidonite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/12/02 11:51:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=92.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff7/faces/caitsith.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Saying the symbol is the best neck for druids is dumb to begin with due to the fact that a ton of druids can't even use it.<br>
<br>
And for the raiding druid, like me, the symbol sucks. I don't solo much at all, I'm always raiding. The only time's I've done exp since Luclin was out with ae groups, no use for it there.<br>
<br>
I don't see the point of it saving a spell slot. Hell the rare times when I do go solo in seb I keep soe memmed for when I gate out to refresh it. It's not like we're lacking for spell slots. <p><center>
