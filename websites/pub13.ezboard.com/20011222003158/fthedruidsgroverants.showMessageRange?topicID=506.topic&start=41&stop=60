Not once have a seen a polite, well mannered, or tactful post from you. You are insistant on flaming and being audacious in every post you make, ignoring the emotions of others. It is truly despicable behaviour and you should quite certainly, be ashamed of yourself.<br>
<br>
In responce to your last post, it would not surprise me if you did not do a single task you said you did. In fact, judging you from your downright-pathetic posts, you prabably told those people who requested a port to &quot;f**k off&quot; or something similar. Dont tell me I shouldn't &quot;judge a book by its cover&quot; (as says the old cliche) for I have read your numerous replies on this forum, and I became ever more revolted.<br>

Dude, realize something....  I know...we all know...you have a little trouble with words, and with your small 2 year old vocabulary, you probably can't read any of the links you click on with that thingy that looks like a mickey mouse hand *psst* it's a mouse.  But, before you enter a web page, you should look up two words, and try to understand why they go together, why you click on the word *Rants*....maybe you just enjoy the clicking sound, but in that case, maybe you should stick to the kiddie toys.  This is a FLAME BOARD.  Something you retarded home-schooled fucks don't understand is on FLAME BOARDS (come on....say it slowly if you're having trouble) is that you are not supposed to be candy-cane lane sweet on it.  You are allowed to voice your opinion, and that is what I have done.  Do you realize how boring this site would be without guys like me?  I know you are checking this web page every 30 mins or so just to see what I chose to post in response to your (again...as like every other poster here) weak ass flame.<br>
<br>
   &quot;...Not once have a seen a polite, well mannered...&quot;<br>
<br>
You want well-mannered?  Go to the @#%$ General -EQ topic board ya @#%$ moron.  THE WHOLE point of a flame board is to let it all out about whatever.  So in response to your weak ass flame<br>

Really quite pathetic. Rants does not necissarily equal flames, it's only trolls that make it that way.

And I think all this 'big talk' (commonly known as giving one's self an ego kick, self inflation, etc.) is just to compensate for something, as they say.<br>

I think Boofy had a perfectly good point back there, and I couldn't agree more, especially with the &quot;pay it forward&quot; theory.<br>
So what's with the sudden provocation?  What did he do?<br>
<br>
Not that I condone the response at all, even though I understand how it was so blatantly provoked.  Just because it's a rants forum, doesn't mean you shouldn't have at least a *little* bit of respect for the person on the other side.<br>
Perhaps you feel good flaming random people for no reason (or at least, an extremely trivial one) because you're hidden behind a keyboard.  If this is the case, then grow up. <p>-- <br>

<br>
  LOL. The truth of this whole thing is you get treated exactly<br>
  how you treat people. Honestly, the beggar gets the least<br>
  and the quiet person gets the most. If I'm in a newbie zone<br>
  I get about 30 tells asking for this that and everything else<br>
  but when I passing through and I see someone killing the<br>
  little mobs, wearing nothing and wielding that newbie weapon<br>
  I often stop and buff them. Needless to say they are happy,<br>
  gracious and polite that someone took a couple minutes out<br>
  and gave them a hand. On the opposite side - greedy,<br>
  demanding, rude, little beggars won't get anything. FYI,<br>
  calling someone names because they won't buff you won't<br>
  make anyone stop and say &quot;well gee, player XXX things I'm<br>
  a YYYY so I'll run over, buff them and they'll think I'm a<br>
  swell person&quot; it just gets you added to another ignore list.<br>

this is how i see this,,the exact minute i arrive in gfay, a lev 51 druid, no matter what im doing there, i get a jillion tells for sows, buffs, money, gates and free stuff, or the famous,,&quot;can you pl me?&quot; If a person asks me for a sow, and i give him one whether he asks politely or not,as i try to sit back down,  the same person asks me for a buff, after i skin him, i sit back down, the same person asks for a wolf form,,,i do this also, then sit back down. Moments later,, the same person is back with his friends asking for wolf form and buffs..If i were to sit here in gfay, &quot;doing my job&quot; sowing and buffing, wouldnt this take my playing time away from me? I would like to know if im to sow, and buff  everyone who asks, if i get up and gate off, will this mean im being rude because there was one person in the zone that didnt get a sow? <br>
I sow and buff and help out as much as i can, but i dont agree that it is &quot;my job&quot; as a druid to give everyone what they are asking, im not playing this game for everyone else, if i happen to hear someone needing a buff or sow, and i dont have it memmed, and im in the middle of gating or whatever, i will apologize to that person and tell him i dont have it memmed, or i dont have time at this moment. I have gotten a few rude remarks from a few who get upset because i dont take the time to help them, but i shouldnt feel guilty because they are in need of something.  When i was new to this game, i certainly didnt expect others to come to my aid everytime i needed something, i was very grateful if someone came by and helped me. <br>
I think its quite humorous that a few of you would actually expect us to drop  whatever we are doing  because someone yells for a sow on the other side of the zone, and its our &quot;job&quot; as a druid to see to his needs over our own,,,lighten up and get real :)<br>

Stunfuck was just sitting there.  If you had read my posts, you would of known that.  Other side of the zone?  I was standing 3 inches from him.  Again, if you had read my posts, you would of known that.  You would of also known that I asked &quot;Can I have a SoW?&quot;.  When Stunqueer said &quot;One sec..&quot; I said &quot;Thanks!&quot;  Then 2 mins.....NOT RIGHT THEN....2 Minutes later, he stood up, invited all his friends, and ported out.

Three sides to every story, he may have been mid-cast, he may have sat on his 'lazy' ass for two min.  Third side is the truth, which none of us will know.<br>
<br>
One point though, you mentioned being a druids job to sow ppl.  Even compared it to a tanks job of taunting (begging, disarming, generally building hate) in a group.  IMHO I dont 'owe' jack to anyone who walks up to me and asks for anything.  (especially if they dont even use please, in my book anyways)  That is a different topic than someone fullfilling their 'ROLE' in a group.  Helping someone just because, you arent gettn 'paid', its just for the sense of being nice and helpin another person out.  I do this quite often.  If I'm in a group, everyone better damn well be doing their job to the best of their ability.  They are getting 'paid', if not in plat or loot, at least in exp.  (hopefully)  I just think the two are like comparing apples to oranges, I (my opinion here) feel I owe a group my best (for warriors that would include your example of tuanting), but dont owe a person I dont know from adam asking out of the blue for buffs, plat, pl'ing etc... jack.<br>
<br>
Now I whole heartedly agree that what goes around comes around, but I must admit, when someone comes up and expects me to buff them, give them 1k pp just because I can make it back in a day if I chose, PL them cause all I'm doin is sittn in ec tunnel veggn anyways, or whatever I'm up to etc etc etc.  It rubs me the wrong way, and these types of people are less likely to recieve help from me.  I dont go to lvl 60's asking to be PL'd or ask for 30k cause they can make that back in one drop.  People need to play the game for themselves.  If you want sow all the time whenever, get jboots, play a dru/sha/etc whatever.  If you play a class that cant TP, you know that goin in, just like I dont get mana regen til higher up, its not a chanters job to give me CII.  Just my 3cp.  Broke now. =)<br>

You needed friends to do that? <br>

I've played a 51 warrior a 40 monk and finally a 55 druid.<br>
<br>
Ask me for a SoW, and if I'm not in a bad mood, you'll prolly get it.  But I don't owe you diddly squat unless you are in my guild/alliance.  Life w/o SoW sucks, yes, but I'm not the server SoW/Port bitch.<br>

I don't recall seeing that, I saw rants. That is completely different. You have attacked every poster on this thread with the single comment of &quot;I know you are checking this web page every 30 mins or so just to see what I chose to post in response to your (again...as like every other poster here) weak ass flame.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for being PLed to 50 in 20 days...thats worth bragging about? You are all about getting something for nothing, just like that guy that sits at an intersection holding a sign that says &quot;will work for food&quot; but has no intention on working but soley dependant on other's generousity and taking full advantage of it. You are a bum and although you are not on my server, there are plenty like you. Your comments on this thread are a direct reflection of you in real life... a neglected childhood whose parents never taught you anything about being polite, being responsible, working hard to attain things you want, setting goals and so on.<br>
<br>
You bore me<br>

If you think it doesn't get old fast it does. As others point out, in EQ, one nice deed deserves another hundred - all from the same person.<br>
<br>
I belive Boofy said he's in the 50s. If so, buying SoW potions should be a no brainer.<br>
<br>
I was talking with my friend last night about how EQ has probably caused more hurt feelings than any other game in history (he, except maybe risk lol).<br>
<br>
If you feel slighted or perturbed at someone in the game, just let it slide. Unless you are on a PvP server you have no way of exacting revenge. Yelling and name-calling won't make you feel better, probably make you feel worse in the end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthebouygezaire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thebouy GeZaire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/9/01 5:47:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Throw another log on the fire</span><hr size=1> LMAO this is a funny thread!!<br>
Personally I usually sow people 90% of the time but if I am busy or meding to do something I won't help people who I don't even know.<br>
I would always have time to drop a sow on a friend or guildie....but i don't Owe anything to anyone else out there.<br>
<br>
As everyone else I reserve the right not to have to sow anyone and everyone I see, so I can get on with what I am doing.<br>
If people want sow that bad:<br>
1) Play a sow class (or bard)<br>
2) get a second account with a druid/shammy<br>
3) Buy potions<br>
4) get Jboots<br>
If you are none of the above be grateful when you get sow :)<br>
<br>
As for everyone in this game it is your Job to enjoy yourself.<br>
Some people love going into newbie zones PLing, buffing and handing out gear,  Some people like sitting at Druid portals and Ganking people as they appear and taking their items (I play on Rallos :) )....Basically at the end of the day it is a game and you should play it in a way you are happy.<br>
In RL some people will help you at every chance others won't, sometimes even the people who help don't have time to help.<br>
<br>
Just thought I would give you another way to look at it ;)<br>
<br>
P.S Never put people on ignor....just let them talk at you and reply &quot;Really How interesting!&quot; everytime (Get a hot key).<br>
Trust me they will be getting really pissed off at their end and you will be chuckling ;)<br>

Petty Differences! =)</span><hr size=1> Ok in regards to what Zoofy said about being OWED a SoW. And during a group just sitting and letting the druid get Whacked, you are facing a double negative with that idea.  <br>
<br>
      FIRST once Druid IS dead say something unexpected pops on your group and he was your main healer?(Don't tell me this can't or won't happen cuase then your proving your stupidity even more)  YOUR SCREWED at this point in time and your dislike for this druid just cuased your Group to get slaughtered.  Or something gets away cause the Druid couldn't get snare(ensare i like more but hey) off, and a HUGE train comes back to greet your Group.<br>
<br>
    SECOND you have a druid that don't like you and possibly 4 other people that don't want to EVER group with you again becuase in their mind you can't do your JOB of keeping the casters ALIVE! And let's say the other 4 peeps go on to Join UBER guilds well from now on you will NEVER be allowed in their guild.<br>
<br>
The only time i Feel i OWE someone a SoW is when we are GROUPED other wise your well being is NOT a factor in MY Survival.<br>
