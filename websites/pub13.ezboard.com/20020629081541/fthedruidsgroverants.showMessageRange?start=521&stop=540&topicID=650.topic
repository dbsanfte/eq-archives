the petition. I think as a whole, druid's were shafted with SoL expansion. Four useful spells out of 11 or 12 is a pretty bad ratio. I commonly use SoE, Disjunction, Natures Recovery and Circle of Seasons. Moonfire would be nice but that I know of, ONE has dropped on Veeshan server. <br>
<br>
PotG is nice in groups where you don't have a cleric but it's more of a nuisance than anything on raids. Last night, I had to cast it on 4 people out of 36. Nice way to blow 4,800 mana... (tx wizards!) At least I got to damage shield the MT since there were no mages to be found. Was actually kind of confused when the MT asked for thorns... I had to do a /who mag to see if this guy had smoked crack prior to the raid.<br>
<br>
I'm not one to bitch. I take what's given to me and make the best of it but I do agree that I'd like to end one fight with some mana and feel like people would've noticed had I not been there.<br>
<br>
On a side note, there's a lot of bitching being done. How come no one has mentioned anything about our AC debuffs. We can debuff ac like it's nobody's business... Sure it takes 5 spells but if there's plenty of clerics and you don't mind aggro whoring, you can actually make a huge difference in a big fight.<br>

This petition does not (the Monk petition discussion was actually started by a Rogue). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> The discussion was started by Arafain, who wanted to know why Monks were being flamed into oblivion on the Safehouse. Without his incredibly well written inquiry, and phenomenal willingness to discuss the issues with us, there's no way in hell we would have had that petition. Still, I don't think I saw more than thirty members of other classes present during those talks. We certainly didn't invite the other class boards to participate until well after the petition was drafted. I suspect this is much like what happened here... How much input have you Druids had over the past few weeks of discussion from Clerics and Shaman? <br>
<br>
We didn't have the total support of any other community but our own, all the way through the petition process. We had ten flamers from the other classes to every one person from the other classes who did support us. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  2. VI gave Monks a specific place ingame damage-wise. The Monks simply gave damage ratios showing the disparity. Proving (quite simply) what was wrong. VI has yet to define the role of Druids by using such a claim. VI simply named them the Priest class (which implies healing to me). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well, that's true. What I see here are Druids showing the same sort of disparity but in terms of healing ability, not damage output. Shaman and Druids apparently should be tied as second tier healers, behind clerics. All other healers should be behind them. It's very clear to me that Shaman make better healers than Druids, so I see no reason not to give them a boost in healing power. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  3. Monks then came up with ideas that stepped on the toes of no one. Not only that, we got the ok from the Warriors and Rogues that visited and added to the discussion. The Druids here did no such thing. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well, not quite. We had the approval of a few select Rogues and Warriors who were quite happy to help out. If you check the boards there are similar notes of approval from some high level Clerics and Shaman here in the Druid signature thread and discussion pages. The majority of the other classes dislike the idea, just like the majority of rogues and warriors disliked ours. There were some truly capital flames on our signature thread, I had the pleasure of reading and responding to all of them. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  To the defense of the Druids here, they didn't get the input that the Monks got, and to hear it now is understandable upsetting. But, to compare the Monk petition to this is off-base. Heck... even the ideas that didn't make it directly to the Monk class, showed up in AA skills. Funny how VI works no? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I really don't know what sort of input they got because frankly I had heard nothing about this until two days ago. Really, I wouldn't have expected to. Monks don't have much say in this sort of thing, we aren't casters or healers. This thing has to be worked out between Clerics, Shaman, and Druids. I do agree about the AA skills... we thought we wouldn't be getting any defense upgrades but they later showed up there. Who knows how they plan to address this Druid issue. I wouldn't expect to see the fruits of it until the caster balancing goes in, and we don't know what they plan to do in Planes of Power either. <p>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>

I would rank a druids abilities as follows.<br>
<br>
1. Travel. there are the best class for traveling, with ports, sow, invis.<br>
2. Damage. They do comparable damage to the other caster classes.<br>
3. Mob movement.  They have the best root and snare spells.<br>
4. Healing<br>
<br>
It seems that healing is the 4th ability of a druid.  So why do people want druids to heal?  The problem probably lies in the fact that melees do so much more damage than casters that doing anything to keep melees alive for any amount of time longer is of more benefit that the damage a druid/caster could deal.<br>
<br>
Maybe all casting classes need to have their damage output upped for raid situations.  Maybe druids should be given some lure DD spells.  If the damage done by druids and other casters nuking make the mob die fast enough to not need so much healing then they would be asked to nuke.<br>
<br>
It just seems to me that druids are more of a damage dealing class.  Clerics are the healing priest, shaman the debuffing/buffing priest and druids are the damage dealing priest.<br>
<br>
Another thought I had was about some spell to help keep raid mobs positioned properly.  It seems that proper positioning of some mobs is critical to an encounter. Could some spell be devised to help with this, would it be useful? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utettsuo1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tettsuo1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 3:22:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=526>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~harulestokes/_uimages/StupendousManCharacter.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druids Role?</span><hr size=1> Rav,<br>

My point was, the success of the Monk petition was largely due to the input from the other pure melee classes.  Just getting it pass whatever the number of Rogues and Warriors that participated in the petition discussion meant alot.  If the Druids had that amount of support from the other priest classes, the success of the petition may have been greatly increased.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, the class involved is too close to the problems to see the benefits it has.<br>
<br>
Also note - The Monk petition actually benefited all melee classes.  Cross-class collaborations work, I just wish the Druids had the same support before the petition was finalized. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

Yes we have gates, sow and invis.  That doesnt make us the best at it though.  The majority of ppl i know would much rather have a TL (usually to bind) from a wizard, than a gate from a druid.  They already have sow (via innate run speed, tboots, jboots, or horse), wizards can provide invis, and TL to bind is usually to nexus, where they camp. /shrug  Personally getting gates to the moon is not in my primary focus, although it would be nice so that my friends would not have to wait.  However, not having them means I dont get requests for them too (bonus in my opinion =)) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukesselicewind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kessel Icewind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 3:42:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=528>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I'm pretty sure everyone will agree that druids, and shamans for that matter need some kind of boost in healing for high end game, no matter how minimal. The hard part is making is so druids/shamans do not infringe anymore on clerics, whether it be in aa/exp groups or raids.<br>
<br>
Although there are more issues than just healing brought up by this petition, it helps serve the purpose of making verant look and see that there is a problem, and unfortunately its not just with druids, but with all casters, especially concerning 55+ high end game/raids. If all verant has to offer us is mage focus items as their 'caster balancing' then I see no reason for me to start playing my druid again. The one class I started with and endured since April 99'. I'd rather quit EQ than level another  so-called 'needed' class. I have just as much right to the end game as every other class, no matter what path I chose to get there.<br>
<br>
Druids can solo pretty dam well but we're not the only classes so using that against us is getting very old.<br>
I don't want an upgrade in that respect so finding out how to increase our raid abilities without increasing our solo/group abilities is rather difficult.<br>
<br>
I can do without a new dot, without changing my epic, without ports to luclin but considering i'm asked to heal when I raid then to function adequately I need a little boost in that department.<br>
<br>
I'd be happy if they just removed the 10% penalty for healing. Least that would benefit shamans as well as druids. Then maybe our AA ability Healing Adept would mean we have to work a little bit to further increase our healing ability, even if only up to 10% more. I also think Natures Touch needs minor tweaking, like suggested. Reduce casting time slightly and refresh, even if it stays the same hp/mana ratio as cholorblast.<br>
<br>
I'm not advocation everything in the druid petition but some issues really need to be looked at and worked out a little if im going to continue to play. <p>Venerable Kessel Icewind<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> i would like to make a comment about the druid healling ability's, i personnally think they are fine. in my opnion druids are very comparable to clerics in healling ability. you may not be able to heal a tank with 5k hps on a raid that isn't your responibility, thats mine a cleric.  i have experiance on the high end games, so here is my hypothessis about what i am talking about.  first, clerics have one strength and that is their healling powers, it would be wrong for veraint to give you the better soloabilty which we lack, and than give ya more healing power.  second. druids are secondary heallers true, they usually are focused on the group at hand, if you have good aggro control no one but the main tank should be getting hit, which is where the clerics attention is at.  3rd a lvl 60 cleric can solo in the gray but that is one of the rare places a cleric hunts as most monsters there are light blue to a 60 and not worth the mana expenditure for the little xp we get.  as for the single potg buff i  have to agree the druid in my guild complains about me overwriting hers every time. as for the amount of mana you expend during a given fight thats all fine and dandy but where di you get your equations about what a cleric casts on these raids. i spend 450 mana every 25 to 27 seconds with a mana pool of 3600 give or take a few, even with specialization i only get about 10 to 15 complete heals. might i point out also that one of my most powerful non cheal spells is divine light which costs the same as a complete heal 425 mana.  so druids have a compareable heal to one of our lesser spells which we as clerics never bother to use, remedy.  by giving you another heal spell you could theoratically take the place of a cleric which shouldn't happen, not talking about a raid but when xping. in my opinion druids are one of the strongest class's on EQ. you have soloablity along the levels of a wizard, sow, teleportation, buffs, debuffs, and heals. clerics have buffs,undead killers&lt;if you can find any worth killing&gt;, and heals&lt;primary duty&gt;.  so druids are a strong class, and are needed in a big raid for there value in keeping that cleric or enchanter alive with there small heals. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59187">Mnayr, Lord of all EVIL</A> <BR>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> First off let me state I am a cleric.  I have been a cleric since Jul of 99.  <br>
<br>
This petition bothers me for a few reasons.  I will put them in sequence for ease of rebuttal or refute if you desire.<br>
<br>
1)  Direct heals.  Ok druids have a 10% penalty.  VI has given you the ability to counteract that via healing adept.  You can also increase the amounts you heal via healing gift.  I have healing gift and it crits enough to useful.  With some work you can heal better with your current spells at level 60.  <br>
<br>
2) Larger dots.  How exactly does this help in end game raid situations?  Seems like a way for you to solo even easier.  <br>
<br>
3) Heal over time-Ok druid heal over time isn;t so spectacular.  However, in many exp groups that is all clerics need to use.  That spell alone would mean many clerics get no group.  Add in the other nice druid spells like regen, thorns, str etc, who would want a cleric?  I realize many exp camps need cheal, but the easy grind spots would be taken from clerics.  Druids can and do heal in many of these spots as it is already.  <br>
<br>
Other things I agree with or want to point out eventhough others may have.<br>
<br>
1) Lure nukes-Giving druids spells that land on uber mobs would be beneficial if not too large.  Wizards should be the master of magic damage.  <br>
<br>
2) Debuffs.  Druids have massive debuff abilities for ac, attk, and fire.<br>
<br>
3)  Your proposed changes affect everyone(especially clerics), not just the elite.  Ancient spells should be the only way any of these changes are implemented.  If the end game druids have problems, fix them.  Don't make l33t drood__001 even better at hogging all the mobs in quadkite zone __002 or Farmfest__003.<br>
<br>
4) Druids have the option to solo for exp all the way to 60 in decent fashion if so desired.  You can even make good cash to buy things from group dungeons.  Cycles in Skyfire and Trak teeth immediately come to mind.  I, as a cleric, have soloed far more than most.   It is slow at best, even at 60(2 light/low blue mobs per mana bar at best).  Making druids exp group capable takes away my main source of exp, leaving me no real options.  You want the best of both worlds.  <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
By that same logic, wouldn't it be said that if we have non clerics chain healing the MT until CH's kick in while we bring a new MT up, we need to learn better execution?<br>
<br>
A raid should not be solely dependant upon perfect execution. There are times when the rampage tanks die, or get out aggro'd for a bit, etc etc. The fact is rarely, if ever, do the rampage tanks take every rampage for the entire fight. Frequently you'll have other melee casters who jump onto the list for various reasons for a short amount of time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Your understanding of rampage is flawed. The rampage list doesn't have the fluctuation that you seem to think it does. The rampage list is populated by the first people to get on the hatelist for a mob. Once someone is added to the rampage list, they are on it until they die. No one jumps &quot;onto the list for various reasons for a short amount of time.&quot; That is how many guilds have dedicated rampage tanks.<br>
<br>
Patch heals prior to a CH cycle getting started are a different thing. You are reaching, and not doing it very well I might add. There are several reasons why you have patch healers before the CH cycle gets going. Remember I said that CH was intended as a non time dependant spell? It's slow cast time means it cannot be cast at the start of engagement on the MT and land before he dies, but once the CHs start landing every 3 seconds, the cast time becomes largely irrelavant. (Do I have to belabor the obvious again?) It also allows early heal aggro to be spread among larger number of healers. Using patch heals IS execution. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt; Has it occurred to you that this might have been done specifically to increase the contributions of secondary healers of all types to a raid? &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok..maybe you aren't understanding something here. When raid leaders think of secondary healers, they think &quot;Druids&quot;. This isn't increasing our contribution..this is simply showing me that as my guild moves to tougher mobs in the months ahead..I'll be insufficient to heal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When you get to the point that a druid is unable to effectively act as healer for damage dealer/utility class groups a cleric would likely not be able to do the job either. It is either going to be a healing speed problem or a mana efficiency problem. Clerics really don't have that much better healing speed than druids do. Chloroblast is very similiar to remedy, and NT is very similar to DL. Clerics do have better efficiency than druids do with spells like CE and CH, as it should be. If your problem is that clerics can last a long fight better than a druid, that's the way it should be. If your concern is that people simply take damage too fast to heal, keep in mind no cleric is going to be able to keep up with that kind of damage output by themselves either. <br>
Unlike clerics and most other classes, when a specific role is not viable for a particular mob, druids can step up and fill other roles adequately. How many of the Luclin high end mobs do druids have problems nuking after debuffs have landed? How much damage can a druid do to the Luclin high AC mobs compared to most melee classes?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt; None of the secondary healers should be solely responsible for long periods of time dependant healing, with the exception of mobs that AE. That is the job of a cleric. As mentioned before, non clerics should not be healing rampage damage. Riposte damage is not time dependant, the person taking riposte damage can always turn off attack to avoid dying. If someone gains aggro from the highest end mobs, even if a cleric was in the group, they would not be able to put out enough time dependant healing to keep that character alive, not by themselves. That is the entire reason there is such a thing as a CH chain. (Sorry to belabor the obvious) &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Now that you are done telling me and my guild how things should and shouldn't be healing...have you every actually played a healing class on raids of this stature? Shouldn't be healing this, shouldn't be healing that. Guess what. We are healing this and that. Plain fact. With every guild.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
In an earlier post, I described how I played a shaman on an AoW raid. Due to the fact that my fastest and best heal was chloroblast, I wasn't even assigned as a healer, I was assigned as the dedicated shrinker (woot! I had a role!). I also contributed damage from the shaman cold nuke. <br>
<br>
I wasn't telling you how I think your guild should be playing. I was giving my opinion on what should and should not be possible in terms of healing from a balancing perspective. &lt;- Other than the rampage thing of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You missed the point I was trying to make. Secondary healers should be capable of healing incidental damage like riposte damage. They should not perform the function of primary healer on a raid. If a druid is healing someone who has gained aggro and maintains it for a long time, they have become a primary healer. That <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be a job that requires a cleric. In high end encounters, it usually requires at least <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> clerics. The exception is rampage damage, which IMO should require a cleric or 2 secondary healers. <br>
<br>
Are you arguing that a druid should be able to adequately heal a non warrior who has gained aggro from the AoW? No 2 clerics would be able to do that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt; Did it ever occur to you to wonder why druids are assigned as healers on raids? &lt;&lt; <br>
<br>
Because Shamans are busy doing Malo and Slow and that other shaman stuff and then usually dying. That is why. <br>
<br>
Oh btw, most groups now would rather have a paladin healing them on a raid than a druid. This is wrong. Plain and simple wrong. No hybrid should be able to out perform a pure class in their assigned balliwick. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, malo and slow...that will occupy 1 or 2 shamans. You just can't heal as fast with chloroblast as you can with NT.<br>
<br>
Most groups <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fighting AE mobs</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would rather have a paladin <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> in addition</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to a dedicated healer. The recast time on HWoP is 30 seconds. 594 points of healing every 30 seconds is just enough to keep up with AEs with good resists, but the paladin has no effective quick casting, stackable heal. We use sup heal for that. When I fight AE mobs as a 59 paladin, I have about 150 WIS plus about 200 mana. I can cast HWoP 3 times. I do not have enough mana to handle group heals and spot heals at the same time. Combine a paladin with a druid, and the group is just peachy. Paladins outperform druids in one very specific and limited area. We do not have nearly the range of healing skills that druids do. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

1- Introduce another heal at 60, that can heal 3K HP, takes 12 seconds to cast, 45 second recast time, for 650 mana. <br>
Basically a scaled down &quot;complete heal&quot; for a druid to use when we can't find a cleric. Call it:Rejuvenation of Tunare.<br>
<br>
2- Druids should have a port to somewhere in Luclin. Just one. Even if it's Grimling Forest, or another remote location. This will at LEAST give them a more palatable choice than Succor or Lessor Succor, and make it castable ONLY from within &quot;Luclin Dungeons&quot;. Remember Wind of the North and South? I thought so.<br>
<br>
3- Direct Damage - I think our high level direct damage spells need just a bit of tweaking on the resist rates, or give us an outdoor aoe lightning(magic) based upgrade. Remember, we're the priests of Nature. We can stop the rain but I'm surprised that Verant didn't give us a post 50 mighty strike from the sky to call our own single class caveat.<br>
<br>
4 - Epic - Considering I'm 2 mobs away from mine, and probably will have mine within a week or two, I'm finding it more and more disheartening to see druids not using theirs for the reasons mentioned. I think the suggestions made here for a change to the epic effect are good reasons to get it at least looked at. If it had the snare effect changed to a slow, that would shut most druids up I bet, and put the epic back in the Epic.<br>

<br>
&quot;We were not the best in any of these fields; such was the price we paid for our broad spectrum of abilities—we knew this and accepted it.  However, if Druids were not the best in these fields, they were second or third, otherwise we would not have been considered viable.&quot;<br>
<br>
No one should be a viable alternative to multiple other class.  That would make that class the most useful in the game.  What do you propose?  We give Druid CH, Ice comet, slow?  Give me a break.<br>
<br>
Notes about the end game for druid:<br>
1.  I see level 50-60 druids solo mobs that most other classes struggle with all the time.  So they obviously have the ability to do adequate damage.<br>
2.  In raids against mobs that AOE, druids are still extremely effective healers.  As well as providing great resistance buffs.<br>
3.  Last I checked Druids could port basically anywhere a wizard can.  The only exception is translocates (big deal).<br>
4.  Druids are still the 3rd best hp/ac buffers in the game.  PoTG is very nice.  You shouldn't expect to buff like a shaman or cleric.  A shaman or cleric can't solo as easily as you (or port).<br>
<br>
Just because the druid class had more advantages than other classes at early levels doesn't mean you have the right to ask for more advantages at the end game.  Druids are still useful they are just not specialized (you said that yourself).  The end game needs specialization.  The day druids get CH, can melee like a hybrid or get wizzy power nukes is the day I cancel all my EQ accounts.  It's ridiculous to ask to be a viable alternative to multiple other class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubatou062671.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Batou062671</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 5:31:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=535>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Druids Role?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Maybe the druids role shouldn't be as a healer.

Solution?  I'll even give you multiple choice.<br>
<br>
1).  Bring more healers to raid.<br>
2).  Make an online petition saying that 1 cleric can not keep his tank alive in all situations, and should be able       to, therefore clerics need more healing power.<br>
<br>
If you can't see the innate logic in that, I don't know how to explain it more.<br>
<br>
If you can't heal the AE damage, well then maybe you need more healers.  Most people I know are pretty realistic with regards to knowing how much damage one character can heal.  If you're taking more damage than you can heal, well then damn, don't ya think it's time to get more healers?<br>
<br>
Point is this:  A while back, necros formed up a list of stuff pretty similar to this, and VI said &quot;Look guys, we understand you're not feeling important on raids, but here's the problem.  You're one of the most powerful soloing classes there is....almost to the point where it's overpowered.   We're willing to help you guys out, but we're not going to increase your solo ability doing so.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, druids ADMIT, that they don't need any help in the solo department, they ADMIT that they don't need any help in XP groups, but they want help on raids.  Well that's where your problems are gonna start.  You're not going to get a new DOT, or a change to your epic effect, because those will increase your solo ability.  You're not going to get better heals that will make you heal better than a cleric in XP groups.  The real thing you need to look at is how you can help out the 10 druids on each server in the uber guilds, without overpowering every druid below you....and making things level 60 isn't going to help that fact. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubatou062671.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Batou062671</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/10/02 5:35:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=537>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No valid point</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just because the druid class had more advantages than other classes at early levels doesn't mean you have the right to ask for more advantages at the end game.

1)  We didn't even ask for lure anything because Verant has allready stated that they would never give another nuke out.  Also it was determined that the druid nukes were fine the way they were and needed no imporovement.<br>
<br>
2)  Debufs were brought up, however, the problem with the druid debufs is no one can prove they do a damn thing.  What is suspected is that the mobs attack and defense are so high that even with huge minues to them, no noticable effect is had.  Even then, the vaunted druid stacked debufs is allmost a stacking exploit, which in and of it self makes it a questionable thing to request an enchanment to.  We looked long and hard out our debufs before the petition, but the attack and ac just seemed to have no noticible effect.<br>
<br>
The problem is even if they DO have an effect, no one NOTICES it so no one thinks the druids did a damn thing for the raid so why should they bother with druids? <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I do not agree with many of the points brought up in the petition.  This will probably get rather lengthy...<br>
<br>
I'll start out by saying I'm a 59 paladin, and also have a 58 monk...I have numerous other characters as well and have played every class (except beastlord) to a certain degree.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding the petition....I will agree that in most every situation I can think of, the druid is considered a secondary healer, even *the* secondary healer of choice.  Your petition seems to fail to remember this point.<br>
<br>
A druid is not supposed to become a primary healer...at least not by default (they can function as such in many cases).  If you consider that you are a backup healer to a cleric, you should be able to handle filling in as needed no matter how many hit points the melee (based on the examples, I have to assume you are meaning &quot;warrior&quot;) has.<br>
<br>
Too often I've seen a 60 druid cast that heal just in time to save the warrior from going down and giving the cleric enough time to get CH off...<br>
<br>
Why do you compare an &quot;average level 60 druid&quot; with shamans with torpor (not what I would call &quot;average&quot;)?  Sure that shaman can heal 1200 hp over 24 seconds, but whoever just got healed for that is slowed AND snared...not always benefits to the person you are trying to heal.<br>
<br>
You also try to compare this to the paladin group heal?  Just how often is *that* useful?  Sure, it's a level 58 spell, and in places like the HoT in ToV it's very handy fighting AE mobs that are hurting your entire group...but otherwise?  unused...or IF used, it's not doing max healing since very few people in the group are hurt.<br>
<br>
Yes, last night in HoT the druid who was primary healer in our group wished he could heal like I was doing (Healing Wave of Prexus).  However, if a cleric had been in the group, his role would likely have been filling in the gaps while the cleric used his heal over time on group members, and I could have paid more attention to melee'ing.<br>
<br>
You compare a druid using 2000 mana to heal 4,400 points of damage whereas a cleric can heal 1,500 for 250 mana.  However, this is rather biased as a druid should, by your petition, not be required to heal 4,400 on one person.  Let me turn the tables on you slightly.  Remember:  focus = druid as a secondary healer.  Druid can heal ~1000 points in 5.5 seconds for 400 mana.  No shaman or paladin or cleric(!) can heal that many points on a single target in that speed (clerics can come close though with Divine Light).<br>
<br>
You state:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Druids are finding themselves in a position of having to use over half of their mana pool over a very long period of time to heal a single caster or priest, let alone a melee class.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again you are forgetting that a druid is a secondary healer, not a primary.  This would be more relevant if your role was as a primary healer...if you are fighting for that position, then please make it clear in the petition.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Druids are the class most called on to be secondary healers. Paladins are mainly a melee class. Shamans are usually busy with buffs, slows, and debuffs. Yet Druids find themselves behind both classes in healing ability.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I will never compare myself as ahead of a druid in healing ability.  If a druid thinks I have more healing ability, that druid doesn't know how to play their class.  (remember:  my mana pool is *trivial* compared to a druid.  I think my wisdom is regularly around 110 - 120 based on what I'm wearing.)<br>
<br>
Regarding your points...<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First, we would ask Verant to remove the 10% serverside healing penalty for all non-cleric healers. We wholeheartedly agree with the 5% bonus that clerics receive, but the penalty has outlived its usefulness. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm indiffirent to this one.  I don't see it making that much of a difference.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) Change the duration on Nature's Recovery from three minutes to 24 seconds and remove the recast time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This would be too powerful as it would bring you with a spell that's even more powerful than what clerics have.  Celestial elixer is ~1000 hp for 300 mana.  Again another example sounding more like you want to take over the role of primary healer instead of a secondary one.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2) Give Druids a group heal—something along the lines of 880 hitpoints healed per member for 900 mana.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->/boggle?  Clerics' Word of Restoration is a 750 group heal for 900 mana....<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3) Give Druids a larger direct heal. Nature's Touch is insufficient for our current needs; the damage-per-second output of mobs has far surpassed the ability of Nature's Touch to keep even ourselves healthy, much less an entire group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again, not sure how this fits in with an assumption of being a secondary healer...<br>
<br>
I like the idea of druids having a single-target version of PotG.  This makes amazing sense!<br>
<br>
I also like the idea that neither Aegolism or PotG overwrite each other....it would save a lot of headache.<br>
<br>
Your epic is your own <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Not going to touch that one...I do know some epics are more effective than others and a variety of &quot;fixes&quot; would make sense. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This brings us nicely to our third concern: DoTs. Druids don't receive an upgrade to damage-over-time spells after level 53. We would ask for an upgrade to Winged Death—something along the lines of 1950 damage over 50 seconds at level 58 or 59.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Just curious...why?<br>
<br>
Regarding teleports...you mention that evac off of luclin is the only way to remove from danger.  Don't forget you do have the ability to succor which generally does end up in a safer point of the zone... With the theory that druid ports are somewhat tied to druid locations, I don't understand how it would make roleplaying sense to port on Luclin.  A wizard's port to the Nexus makes sense in so far as there are wizard portals there (the structure).<br>
<br>
The cold debuff line makes sense, since you do have a fire debuff line.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your petition!<br>

I have a Level 50 Druid. I have lvl 44 cleric. I have yet to hit the high end game, never been on a raid to the plains yet. But I have been playing for 1 1/2 years. ( I have other Char's too ) I love my Druid, but I do not agree with the petition, why make a Druid a Cleric, which it seems the majority of the petition is asking for. WHY WOULD YOU DO IT? Well if I had never played a cleric then maybe I would agree with it, but since I have I would say, WHY MAKE THE DRUID INTO A CLERIC, WHY? Then there would be no reason to play a cleric, because frankly I love the fact that I can DOT, SNARE, REGEN, DS, TP, RESIST BUFF, DEBUFF, OMG IF I COULD HEAL LIKE A CLERIC EVEN at the high level then I would never want a cleric. Please stop this before there is no Druid to play. Cause as it is if cleric's did not have the rez ability, no one would play them. Druid are too fun, clerics are good at one thing HEALING and BUFF FOR MORE HEALING, and then against undead they are like adruid too, but this is not often, but change this then why be a Cleric.

<br>
First I do want to say I have read many of these posts from non druids and find many them intelligent and well thought out (but of course there is also a lot of &quot;we hate druids&quot; crap that is not worth too much attention). <br>
<br>
One of the better ones responded to the original petition point by point.  I wanted to throw out that the whole section on needing to heal 3 to 5 k dmg on a single target as a secondary healer really is valid.  Even a well run guild and a well run raid you will find someone (maybe a rogue, whatever) picks up agro and can't seem to shake it, and if you are the druid watching over them it is hard as hell (and it happens regularly).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I did want to suggest something that I have not stumbled across in the posts I read that might be acceptible as a short term measure for all:<br>
<br>
1) Remove the 10% penalty on healing from all classes that have it but increase the cleric to a 10% bonus (or even 15%).  The point here is that we don't care that clerics are ahead...we want to heal better under the conditions we are expected to.<br>
<br>
2) Make Healing Adept worth the trouble of getting.  As a druid, it is a low priority for me to pursue a whopping 12aaxp points for the end result of healing 10% better (taht is an extra 98 hp on my best heal for an investment of a huge amount of AAXP).  I am sure having read all the ratios for the other classes taht most clerics and shamans feel the same way.  Make this skill worth pursuing, and you will get druids (by definition high level ones, or well at least 50plus), shamans, and clerics ALL pursuing it.  Say first level 5% bonus, second 15%, and last 35% (actually I would go so far as to say 50% for the top level).  For a druid, that would mean the benefit of NT would go from 900 ish to 1200 ish, but clerics would be that much FARTHER ahead on their heals.  Again, this petition has nothing to do with druids compared to clerics.  It is all about druids compared to mobs.<br>
<br>
3) Give druids a group heal but make it for less HP than originally requested (if the original request won't pass).  I would be happy to be able to do Chloroblast level heals to the whole group at once for say 650 mana (no I did not do all the math to compare ratios to other classes but you get the idea).  It is clearly not as valuable as those clerics get (not sure how that stacks to pally), but WOULD be a huge benefit as a secondary healer where (hopefully and most of the time) you are dealing with people getting mostly AoE dmg.<br>
<br>
4)  Yes give us a better dot.  I don't care if it is not quite as powerful as requested, but there is a vast disparity in the effectiveness of druid dots vs other dot classes, and if you are playing a secondary healer a dot is usually all you can spare the mana on (if you do any dmg at all).  Verant IS looking at making changes so the same dot from different sources will stack (ie two druids could both cast Winged Death on the same mob).  This will be a huge increase in the raid contribution from necros, and also from druids and shamans.<br>
<br>
5) Epic was the one thing I really did not care too deeply about in the original petition.  It is great for solo but little else, but so is the necro epic.  Bugs me that necro epic bumps ours instead of just not stacking (ie whoever gets there first will have it stick).  Still, my favorite solution would be the mob is &quot;IMMUNE to the snare portion of this effect&quot; message which would mean you could still at least use it in raid situations.<br>
<br>
Anyway, heart of it is maybe the solution on heals can be found in AAXP, and one group heal.<br>
<br>
I still fully endorse the original post, but know that asking is not getting.  We do need some heal fix, and we really do need a way to be more valuable on high end raids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
