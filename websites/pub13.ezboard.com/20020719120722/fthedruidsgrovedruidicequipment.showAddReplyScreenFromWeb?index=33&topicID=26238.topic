there is nothing in the world more annoying than swapping gear in and out.  i rue the day i ever got es and ss boots, because now i feel compelled to keep them and swap them in and out for the effects when i need to.  the last thing i want is to waste 2 minutes an hour swapping bps in and out for the effect.  i'll wear the damn thing instead, i dont mind the slight losses for the time and aggravation it saves me.<br>
<br>
i also am the clickable queen.  i love effects, and out of 20 armor slots, 9 are clickables and 2 have static effects (3 when i finish my chardok faction), plus 4 more clickable and 1 static effect i carry to swap in and out.  things with effects, like the rotg bps, are more valuable to me than a bp without it.<br>
<br>
my entire goal with my gear is to seek out high hp/mana items with well rounded resists so that i never have to swap resist things in and out again.  i do not want to carry around a bag of resist gear, i hate it more than anything. <p>-K<br>

<br>
I don't think that the likening of nifty mana free spell effects to wearing armor for looks is really valid though. I would think that trying to pump seldom, or situationally, useful stats numbers really high would be more valid a comparison. =/<br>
<br>
<br>
And Kalinn... =)<br>
<br>
&quot;i also am the clickable queen. i love effects, and out of 20 armor slots, 9 are clickables and 2 have static effects (3 when i finish my chardok faction), plus 4 more clickable and 1 static effect i carry to swap in and out. things with effects, like the rotg bps, are more valuable to me than a bp without it.&quot;<br>
<br>
My kinda girl! =)<br>
<br>
I also wear around 9 clickables most of the time hehe, I do change my armor configuration several times a day, but 99 % of the time it's just to pass the time while waiting for mana or whatever kind of downtime is occuring.  <br>
<br>
Let me see if I can rememeber most of my clickies hehe....(some aren't worn, just hotkeyed from general inventory, and some are only worn when I feel like it hehe)<br>
<br>
<br>
Jboots, Manastone, Guise of the Deciever, NW's Boots (for no hassle sow requests, hehe),  NW's (Drones) Bracer, NW's (regrowth) Breastplate, Invis Cloak, Scale of Wolf Earring, Bracer of Hammerfall, Fungi Staff, Share Wolf Form bracer, Tunare Necklace (Unlim Grasping Roots), Silvery Mask (unlim Identify) I know I'm forgettign some but oh well hehe.<br>
<br>
As far as static effects, I gave my Fungi Tunic to my monk and my FB Earring to my SK who was too low to cast water breathing at the time. Recently got a fishgill necksash for EB but ended up also giving it to my monk, So for EB Im using the Anicent Fishing Pole for now. Really cool procs like Earthquake on the Hierophant's Crook also appeal to me, even if they are only good for clearing greens to build faction. Normally I carry a haste items around to wear when I use the crook, but I traded my SCHW's to a friend yesterday so I guess I have to go farm an fbss or group in velk's again hehe. I also carry a multi charge IVU potion and locate corpse wand and anything else I can find with useful or just fun effects. Oh that reminds me I need a new spyglass! hehee<br>

<br>
and exedor, thank you, i completely forgot about my wolf form bracer and disciple necklace (i kept mine at lvl 2 so far for the buff for raiding).  2 more clickables i carry around with me =P  i dont know why i even bother with the bracer, i havent used it in a good 3 months.  my hammerfall bracer is banked these days, and my boyfriends twink cleric stole my manastone, or i'd have even more heh.  oops, and my lodi shield, theres another static i wear that i forgot.  you should look into the earring of woven bark if you dont have it yet, just about same stats as twisted leaves, but has about a 4 second casting snare on it.  i havent memmed snare since i got it.<br>
<br>
hmmm heiro crook, i hadnt considered it, but i should find one for my chardok faction work.  i usually end up pulling baby trains with thorns and regen up, and taking them out with a bit of melee then an ae.  thank you for the idea =) <p>-K<br>

<br>
I simply don't have RoG (or regrowth) up most of the time.  I simply don't need it...*shrugs*  <br>
<br>
<i> I wouldn't give up having shatterning hammers hotkeyed...</I><br>
<br>
Heh...this exemplifies the differences between click addicts and the rest of us (well, me).  I also have the Bracers of Hammerfall, but they've sat in my bank for the past year.  No point in even carrying them.  Same thing with items with snare.  A waste of an effect, in my opinion.  <br>
<br>
My point above was simply that having click items for the sake of the click alone is pretty similar to having an item for the sake of the look.<br>
<br>
If RoG is needed, then pull it out and click away.  Then put the better armor back on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uremkar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remkar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/02 3:01:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26238.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weeeee.</span><hr size=1> I said:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Have you seen AC tests done? I'll try to look some up and &gt;&gt;&gt;post links to them. Unless you get yourself some massive &gt;&gt;&gt;AC, like 1400...<br>
<br>
Korwin said:<br>
**I would ask you the same question. AC doesn't reduce the **damage you take, it simply lowers the average damage **done (aka mitigation). Also, the benefit of AC scales. I **guarantee that 1200 ac is better than 1000 for a druid.<br>
<br>
Actually, there are supposed to be two types of AC, mitigation and avoidance. We don't get to see how much of each we have. Also, the tests I was referring to tested both avaoidance and mitigation. The 3 people that did the tests with different ACs kept track of swings, hits, misses, and damage taken each hit. And the % of times they got hit, as well as the average damage per hit were so close to being identical (actually getting hit a tiny bit more and for slightly higher damage at higher ACs using the same mobs) to at least lend some amount of credibility that small amounts of AC don't make much of a difference, and sometimes fairly large amounts of AC don't either.<br>
<br>
I said:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If I get Vyemm's aggro, I doubt 10ac or 30hps will help &gt;&gt;&gt;me, but the 30hps helps with AE damage that I take.<br>
<br>
Korwin said:<br>
**If you, or anyone in your guild has ever died to Vyemm's **AE then you're doing something seriously wrong. (not **counting 10k's). But name-dropping like that is kinda **cute, hehe.<br>
<br>
Hehe, I apologize, I have been sick with the flu all week, I wrote multiple messages that evening, and was actually writing them all at the same time, and I was talking about NToV dragons in at least 2 or 3 of them. (I was writing them at the same time because I was checking some other posts on other message boards to make sure my information was correct.) I meant Vyemm when I was talking about gaining enough aggro to be summoned and pummeled, hehe, but yes, his AE should not be the factor in getting anyone killed. ;)  I think you get my point, though. If I get aggro on a big dragon, AC probably won't help me, BUT, I should NOT be getting aggro on those mobs, however, it is certainly possible that I need (or am forced) to take an AE here or there. HPs help for melee damage and AE damage, while AC only helps for melee damage, and it doesn't appear to help much, unless, like I said, you get a VERY high AC. &quot;But name-dropping like that is kinda cute, hehe.&quot; Haha, thanks for the derogatory remark. =P /accepts his pat on the head for being cute<br>
<br>
Exedor said:<br>
<br>
&gt;And to adress Remkar's post...<br>
<br>
&gt;As far as AC really making no difference, well I don't parse &gt;everything to see percentages but I know that even when &gt;they are buffed to equal or greater hps, I tend to out tank &gt;most INT casters rather notably. Very often I go self buffed &gt;while the INT casters get aego / symbol and surpass my hp's &gt;but I still outlast them by far when taking hits. They just &gt;keep getting whacked for close to max dmg while a useful &gt;chunk of the time I'm getting hit for far less. So if it's not &gt;the AC doing it I don't know what it is :/<br>
<br>
Two things. One, each class has a different distribution of damage mitigation and avoidance AC. If you test a monk tanking something with 1300AC and a rogue tanking something with 1300AC, you will notice two things. One, the warrior gets hit more often than the monk, and Two, the warrior takes less damage per hit than the monk. <br>
<br>
Here are a couple of things taken off a discussion on another thread, and they fit with the numbers I've seen from multiple tests:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;If a leather bp is 50ac, it is as good as a plate bp with 50 ac. There is no difference between the 2.<br>
<br>
The only difference is that every class has a different soft cap on AC.<br>
<br>
Warriors have the highest, monks have a slight lower one than warriors, altho block &gt; parry.<br>
<br>
I think Rogues have a soft cap on ac between rangers and bard.&quot;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;How you get hit is calculated in 2 ways, mitigation and avoidance. Going from memory here so maybe not 100% sure but should be very close to the truth.<br>
<br>
Avoidance= This determines how much a mob will miss on you. The base thing it uses to determine that is your defense skill, with modifier for high agi or certain classes (monks).<br>
<br>
Mitigation=this is how much dmg your armor absorb when you actualy get hit. This is based on your base AC, not the one you see on screen, that's a mix of both mitigation and avoidance. By base AC i mean how many AC points you armor has.<br>
<br>
So for example a lvl 53 SK  can have a lower ac than say a 60 rogue, but can still tank somewhat better in certain situations. The sk would get hit more often (less defense skill) but would take less dmg per hit (mitigation usualy higher on sk cuz it's simply higher base ac on his armor).<br>
<br>
So the trick to how AC works is understanding that the number you see on the screen is a sort of average of your 2 defenses. So 2 people will same AC can tank very differently, depending on how that AC is split between mitigation and avoidance.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps...&quot;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Notice the line about different classes having different soft caps. It makes sense that Int casters have the lowest caps, therefore, just to make up some numbers, say you are grouped with an enchanter with an 800 AC, but his soft cap is at 500AC, and you have 1000AC as a druid, but your soft cap is 1000AC, then yeah, you should definately notice a difference. <br>
<br>
From what I can tell, for most classes, there appears to be ACs that cause huge jumps in effectiveness, and these seem to be 1200 and 1400. So, if you can get 1200Ac (I can only get to 1000 or so in current gear, unless I get all melee buffs, and switch out some gear, then I might be able to get near 1100), then you very well may notice a big difference. <br>
<br>
My point is, if your AC is not near one of these AC &quot;caps&quot; or whatever you want to call them, then I think hps are defiantely better than AC.<br>
<br>
I think my other point falls into my idea of a druid's responsibility. Personally, if a caster gets aggro, I see that as a bad thing. It is very innefficient if mana has to be spent healing a caster. I can do my job fine and put down alot of damage and use my debuffs and back up heal without getting aggro 99% of the time.<br>
<br>
Higher AC is definately not worse than lower AC, however, as a druid, I think HP, especially when not talking about extraordinarily high AC druids (i.e. 1200+), are better than AC.<br>
<br>
Btw, how many of you actually have 1200+ AC on a normal basis? I think the highest any druid in my guild has self buffed in my guild is between 1000 and 1100 in normal gear, and he has multiple NToV items and some other nice stuff.<br>
<br>
Hope some of this helps clear up my views on the AC/hp issue. Please post if you have any information to back up or refute anything I posted here.<br>

<br>
&quot;I logged ~400k intake from a Fungusbeast in Fungus Grove this weekend. Went from 1489AC -&gt; 977 in roughly 100 AC increments. Was the same fungus beast for the first 3 sets. Then I umm, died (dont ask!) and had to switch to a different fungus beast. This one had a higher max damage, so I'd assume it was a level higher. I switched to a different one that had the same max as the original for the 5th set. Agi was kept constant. Avoidance percentages were constant. Average damage per hit was constant, (within 2 of each other). Each set was about 50k damage intake.<br>
<br>
Basic assumption after this data, AC to tank a Fungusbeast caps lower than 1000 AC. Am going to move to Kael and try some of the higher level giants in Arena for the next set. Can email out logs with my notes (when I get home from work) if you want the raw data.<br>

Certainly at the stage of the game in which you're considering &quot;Best of the Best&quot; items for practical use, the chances are that you're already way over the amount of AC that your druid can use from items, despite that which the green AC number in the client is showing. :)<br>
<br>
For the traditional &quot;PROVE IT!&quot; responders, I'd invite you to parse a few damage logs.  You'll notice that you can remove almost 100 to 150 shown-item AC (200 to 250 displayed AC) from the &quot;top&quot; druids and still see no increase in the amount of damage taken.  <br>
<br>
If you're anywhere near the end-game, then HP/mana/resists are the contributing factors to item improvements, and most of your resists are unchecked for weeks on end given normal geometry use to hide from AEs.<br>

After all, the AC has to come from somewhere, and we cannot presume that all level 60 druids doing named dragon raiding all can get over 1000 AC (or higher) self buffed.  And some of the best AC items are found in the chest slot.<br>
<br>
In any case, it's going to be a druid-by-druid decision...does this particular item boost me over a particular AC level or not? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulotusflystewnicely.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lotusfly Stewnicely</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/02 11:54:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26238.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.prexus.com/ef/becky/snap.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An aside</span><hr size=1> Obviously. ;)<br>
<br>
My words of caution are to those that might, to pick a random example, choose to wear Gladiator Chain Sleeves when their equipment is already giving them all the usable item-AC that they can use without it.  In such cases, choosing the item for its AC is providing no benefit whatsoever, when a more suitable HP/mana item is available.<br>

At level 60, we got about 11 (I think) mana per wisdom, but from 201 to 255, we only got 2 (I think, maybe only 1, thought it was two though) mana per wisdom. <br>
<br>
So, once you hit 200 wisdom, it made more sense to get mana, hp, resist, ac, whatever items in its place, since going from 201 to 255 only added a max of 110 mana, and 110 extra mana is nice... but not for 55 wisdom, hehe.<br>
<br>
So, basically, in the beginning, all of our AC is counted as &quot;normal&quot;, but at some point, lets say 700 just to give a number, there is a soft cap... and maybe any AC above 700 only counts for 10%. So, (not worrying about mitigation and avoidance differences for this simplified example), if you were showing 1000AC... your &quot;real&quot; AC might only be 730... 700, + 10 for each 100 after 700. So, it would make sense, at that point, to not concentrate on AC anymore, and if you are worried about surviving hits, then you should build hps up.<br>
<br>
Does that help?<br>
<br>
P.S.-I'm not saying 700 is a druid soft AC cap... although I wouldn't be surprised if it was in the 700-800 range. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/02 12:54:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26238.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An aside</span><hr size=1> <b><i>What do you mean by useable item AC?</b></i><br>
<br>
Lotusfly's post was somewhat oblique, because I have yet to see someone who perfectly understands the mechanism.  But basically, armor class offers diminishing returns, and classes with lower defense skills probably hit these diminishing returns earlier.  For an example with casters (who have 145 defense skill), read <a href=http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=9&t=006280>this</a> brief study.  On top of this, a class which only gets damaged occasionally benefits even less from an armor class increase.  If you go for over 1000 armor class and ignore hit points and mana, you may be shooting yourself in the foot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uexedor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Exedor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.westol.com/~target/exepic/exedor.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/02 5:03:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26238.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.westol.com/~target/exepic/exedor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An aside</span><hr size=1> &quot;I wouldn't give up having shatterning hammers hotkeyed...&quot;<br>
<br>
I was being somewhat facetious with that comment; I apologize. If it didn't give me 40 hp's it would be bagged also. <br>
<br>
40 hitpoints seems pretty good for a bracer, plus it has the 3 wisdom, a tolerable 6 ac, and nifty effect, so i wear it :)<br>
<br>
BTW Scirrocco, regarding the revived best of the best's- please do keep 'em comin'! :) I was in my post 'popsicle-abortion debates' hiatus for so long I must have missed the originals =(<br>
<br>
<br>
-<br>
And back to the AC thing... <br>
<br>
Last night in seb, where I rarely go, I did some tanking, and I have to say, I really held up well. The 40 hp a tick regen probably helped a bit, though the warrior had just as much. I wasn't losing health much, if any, faster than the 60 war with 300 higher AC, and I was definitely out-tanking the blue anon ranger with 50 higher ac. At least vs the frogs and beetles, the golems however were pummeling me quite handily compared to the warrior, though still not as badly as the ranger. <br>
<br>
For reference, I wasn't even wearing my full ac gear, I was at around 900 with 2024 hp's and 125 agility, the warrior had just under 1200 ac with 92 agility and the ranger had 950 ac with 152 agility. Noone had any buffs other than druid and ranger buffs. Maybe 120 agility really is a big step up?<br>
<br>
The reason that I started rooting them and getting close to tank was basically because the warrior and ranger were getting beat down so fast that tanking for them part of the time and letting regen heal me was saving me alot of mana (as the only healer in the group).<br>
<br>
I'd be really interested to learn more about how this stuff works. That monk's post seemed to indicate that AC may cap differently depending on which mobs you are fighting. Which had never occured to me until he mentioned it. Perhaps as a product of the mob's ATK vs our AC?<br>
<br>
I wonder if there is a hidden racial mod involved? Wood elves are supposed to be nimble, and under the illusion that I generally keep up 24 / 7, a wood elf is what I actually am.<br>
<br>
Hmm... come to think of it, the illusion bug was preventing me from using the guise in seb and many other zones at that time, so  I was &quot;trapped in newbie form&quot; as I semi-jokingly refer to it. And I was also tanking better than I'm used to doing... HMMM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uremkar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remkar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/02 5:37:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26238.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An aside</span><hr size=1> Thanks Tudamorf!
