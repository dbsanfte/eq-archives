Today was the first day of the rest of his life, he had assured himself the night before.<br>
<br>
Ashen crept out of bed, it was just before dawn, and he didn't want to wake the family.  He slipped to the rack where his father's armour lay.  He slipped in to the armor, the chain suiting him well, and looking quite nice.  Ashen, grabbed his father's harpoon and sneaked in to his father's war paint.  e slowly applied the war paint in thin methodic circles about his left eye.  Last, he grabbed his father's shield before slipping quietly from the house.<br>
<br>
Ashen came to the lake which seperated Halas form Everfrost, and after greeting the merchants, and engaging in some friendly banter about the fishing, or the weather lately, or how his family was holding up, he waved good-bye, and dove in to the lake.  The freezing water was refreshing to the North &quot;man&quot; of 14 years.  It chilled his skin, but he liked that, most would be complaining of hypothermia, but Ashen remembered those days by the lake with his father, and cherished them the most.  He surfaced on the toher side of the lake, and shook his armor off, as not to let it rust, he used the heat from his freshly lit torch to dry up the water.<br>
<br>
Ashen after letting his armor dry, stopped at the vendors in the Everfrost peaks.  He had arranged for one to keep a stew, and his bags ready for him to let him get them int he morning.  So, he greeted these vendors, and again engaged in the friendly banter, before taking off to the peaks.<br>
<br>
He'd skipped breakfast, but figure'd he'd have a gran meal for lunch, the fires outside Halas would surely warm a bowl of stew, and perhaps some mammoth meat for him.  He set out, treading carefully through the tundra, he'd been tracking a bear steadily, from what he could tell it was chasing someone, and close on them.  He figured this was one big bear, almost mammoth calf sized.  He couldn't help but search for this bear, it'd surely make a great trophy!  Ashen only hoped he'd be able to kill it, he'd been tracking it all day long.<br>
<br>
Ashen following the tracks of the bear, surely found it just over a hill, the bear was unmoving right now, resting he presumed.  Ashen knew it was about launch, and he was famished.  He slowly raised his harpoon, and charged out.  He was only 15 yards from the bear, when it noticed him, and swung it's heavy head around to see his charge.  Ashen was intent on slaying this beast, he'd spent so much time on.  As he was preparing to slam his spear in to the beast's gut, a force of extreme preasure threw him to the ground on his stomach, his face skidding through the snow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are ye bloody daft, boy!?&quot;  Screamed a husky voice from behind him, presumably the one that had sent him reeling.  Ashen quickly scrambled to his feet, to look at the man, almost 10 feet tall, this man was a giant in his own right!  &quot;Wha...Why'd you hit me!?!&quot;  Screamed Ashen, disappointed his kill was ruined.  The man blinked for a moment, &quot;Are you clueless child?  My name is Jack, Tundra Jack.  This here, is Iceberg, the bear is my companion.  He'd tear ya limb from limb, too.&quot;  Ashen was astounded that the man was friends, let alone communicated with a bear!  &quot;I...I'm sorry, mister Jack...I didn't know honnest...&quot;  Ashen was respectful, and revearing as he'd heard stories of Jack.  He glanced toward Iceberg, nodding to the bear, an apollogy of sorts.  Jack nodded, and handed Ashen a bag of mammoth meats.  &quot;Here...It's obvious you been trackin' me and Iceberg all mornin'.  You got good skills for a Shaman, sorry for the ambush, just had ta make sure ye were pure in intentions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ashen talked with Jack a little while longer, before returning to the vendors, and cashing in some of the mammoth meat, but saving some for lunch.  He used the meat to make a thick, brothy stew, he added some carrots his father had picked up at the miller's in West Karana, recently, and some other assorted vegetables.<br>
<br>
After a hearty lunch, Ashen set out, with two backpacks to fill with skins and meats, he had to make up for his slacking, and horrid mistake earlier in the day.  He stalked bears, leopards, and mammoths, they were relatively easy fights, and quite profitable.  In particular now, he'd been tracking a mammoth that seemed quite large, but not so big as Iceberg.  As he came over a small rise, Ashen found a group of young travellers, crowded around, recovering from a battle.<br>
<br>
Ashen ran up to the travellers, 2 erudes, a Dwarf, a Gnome, and a Human were sitting in the snow, panting.  The dwarf and human had noticable gashes in their armor, and cuts and bruises that were no joke.  The Gnome was healing them slowly, though.  Ashen asked, &quot;What happened!?&quot;  The Gnome spoke in between heals, rather quickly, and it was hard for Ashen to keep up, but he managed.  &quot;This big huge, no wait, massive, yes massive...Mammoth!  That's what it was!  A mammoth!  He attacked us withoutwarning, he gored out friends here, and then and then&quot;  The gnome was distracted by his own thought...Ashen considered them wirey, annoying creatures, but just nodded.  &quot;Oh, yes, and then we ran off...it was too powerful...Be warned, not wise to follow, but we saw a crazy Half Elf running after it!  He's surely gone now, yup.&quot;  Ashen nodded, though a little confused, and thanked the group, before taking off after the mammoth.<br>
<br>
Ashen was smart, but to curious for his own good.  He eventually caught up with the mammoth, and tracked it a moment, falling behind it.  There was something wrong with it, it looked strange, different from others for some reason...It might fetch a fine price, he figured.  Always the opperunist.<br>
<br>
Ashen finally grew tired of tracking it and rushed the mammoth, it turned just in time to wail out in pain, as Ashen's spear slammed in to the side of it's ribs.  The creature was large, and now wounded, so would hopefully fall with ease, thought Ashen as he drew his spear from it's rib cage with a twisting yank.  Ashen leaped back as the mammoth's large tusks swung around, and just barely missed his head.  Ashen lunged in for another assault with his spear, but, his gut was caught by the mammoth's tusk, and hurled him a good 15 feet in the air, before letting him plummet to the soft snow.<br>
<br>
Ashen lay in the snow, his stomach nothing but a gaping hole from the tusk, now.  He lay, in a pool of blood, sure the mammoth would finish him now.  He clenched his eyes closed, awaiting the death blow.  Too his surprise, the pain in his stomach subsided, and all he heard was the wail of the mammoth before the crashing of the beast hitting the snow, dead.<br>
<br>
Ashen's eyes fluttered open to reveal a short Half Elf man, clad in green armor.  Ashen blinked, confused.  The man was shorter than Ashen, had pointed ears, crystal eyes, and brown hair.  Ashen slowly stood, slightly taller than the man before mummbling...&quot;Th...Thank you sir.  Who are ye, may I ask?&quot;  The man nodded with a gentle grin.  &quot;My name's Xican.  You sure are a crazy kid, you know that?  That there was a corrupted mammoth, an abomination of nature.  Very dangerous...They've been known to wander these peaks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ashen blinked taking in the information, and thinking for a moment.  &quot;Do you hunt the corrupted for sport?&quot;  Xican chuckled and shook his head, no.  &quot;No, I hunt these corrupted animals because the mighty Karana wishes it of me.  He's promised to bestow me with a mighty weapon should I cleanse this world of the corrupted beasts, which plague it.&quot;  Ashen nodded, though he had no clue what was going on.  Xican chuckled softly, bagging the meat of the mammoth and handing it to Ashen.  &quot;Here, kid.  It's all yours, and erm...take this as well for your bravery.&quot;  Xican handed Ashen 300 platinum!!!!  Ashen's eyes sprung wide as he looked at the massive amounts of money in his hand!  He couldn't believe it, and for a few moment's just stood staring at the money.  He looked up to thank Xican, but he was gone.<br>
<br>
Ashen took the money, and slowly returned home, this money would feed them royally for a year, he thought!  He slowly made his way home, after purchasing some flowers for his mom, and some toys for his brothers and sisters.  Ashen was the man of the house, now...And this was just the start! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63622">Xican's profile</a>

IC:  A scarred old woman bears the tattoos on her face of a generation past its glory. She has earned retirement to the shop she now owns in the way of too many scars and twisted bones that didn't mend quite right.  She bends over behind a counter and grunts as she lifts a wooden box from Freeport.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, it's finally here, and about time too.  I'll have to discount the price to a few young ones who will test it for me. Can't believe I didn't invent this one myself,&quot; she mutters to herself as she places the jars of Bixie Wax in neat rows on a shelf behind her, &quot;Guaranteed to protect armor from rust, doubles the lifetime of your shields...,&quot; she reads...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm, ya know ol' girl, if it DOESN'T sell for what it's meant for, I can just  see the youngins waxing their Dah's old shields and using them for sleds,&quot; she comments with a chuckle and goes back to stocking her shelves.<br>
