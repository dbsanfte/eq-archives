*******************************************<br>
<br>
Rain, Thunder, Lightning all raged above the rolling hills of Surefall Glade. The druids gathered among themselves within the safety of their haven to work what magic’s they could with the power of the storm, weaving it into tangibles they could call upon later. Cros stood outside the safety of the glade to watch the antics of Karana, though Tunare was his goddess, Karana always held some power with the druids of Qeynos hills, it was from him after all that they drew so many of their combat skills, and it was always with awe that the old druid watched the powerful storms build ebb and eventually burn themselves out.<br>
Cros watched on as the storm grew, felt the energies build in the air around him till it nearly crackled with its own electricity. Hours it raged, never slacking, a constant battering upon the land. Cros wondered what was taking Karana so long… this was far beyond a normal storm. He began to worry, and thought well enough to seek out the shelter of a wolfs form and den to weather out the spectacle.<br>
As the hours stretched on and no break was seen, Cros observed a change, the sky had been slowly changing colors, red seeped from the east, spreading out as bloodstain upon the sky, raging purple from the north flowed and stirred the clouds to meet it. Awed Cros watched the two colors roll and boil above him totally unaware that as they grew closer to each other so did the storm grow louder and closer to the glade. The clashing of lightning and thunder echoed the thrashing of the colors above, as if a great battle took place between them and the thunder and lightning was merely the sound of armies meeting in that battle. <br>
How long Cros stood there he knew not, totally enchanted by the spectacle above him. First it seemed red would win and then purple would gain the upper hand, then back to red and so on the cycle would turn. What it all meant he had no clue, merely that he was here and he would stay to watch what obviously was a battle between gods.<br>
At last the heavens shuttered and the red drew back as if thrown clear from the earthly skies and the purple spread out over Karanas’ land. The lightning still quivered in the background with after shocks of the elemental storm, seething in its own pent up anger at being challenged, after all, who would be daring enough to challenge the god of storms in his very own palace… it was a good question but one Cros did not figure on ever discovering.<br>
Counting the storm over, Cros headed home, his many hours hunched over had made his old bones stiff and he sought the warmth of the fire he knew Holly would have burning in the glade. Shaking out his fur he padded along the ridge of the hills, making his way back. Had he not been in wolf form, chances are his human senses never would have felt the static charge build behind him and he never would have turned in time to see the lone arch of lighting strike the ground silently without light nor thunder to usher in its coming. Walking back the way he’d come Cros found the charred earth where the lightning had struck and in its center was a child, nay, a newborn, for truly it couldn’t have been more then a few minutes old. Quickly shaking off his fur guise Cros bent down to the child picking her up and wrapping her in his cloak. <br>
Staring down upon her Cros was at a loss as to what to make of such a creature for surely though Half-elfs were common, this gift from Karana was beyond mere human making. Her skin was the blush of dawns first light upon cold winter clouds, her eyes were the very purple of the sky as it raged in its most furious moments not but minutes ago, and her hair was as white as summer daisy's, she was truly a child of Karanas’ making. As Cros looked up to the heavens the wind ruffled his hair, and upon its breath Karana whispered to him, “Care for her, she will need your knowledge and your love, she is my daughter Blurain, and I give her to you …for now….”<br>
Cros wasted no time getting the rain soaked child into the safety of the glade, though if he’d thought about it, he would have realized that a child of Karana was safe no matter what the elementals around her.<br>
As Blurain was being introduced to her new home, to the east whence the red had come, a woman lay dieing in the mountains of the Karana’s, an ancient Treant stood over her, the only observer to the suffering of this mortal vessel, and when at the last, when finally she would let him, he snuffed out her life for her, that pain would seek her out no more and peace would be found for her among Erollisi Marr, the goddess of love. For surely that is where this woman, who’s only fault it was to love, could go and find peace at last. <p><center><img src="http://gov.alaska.edu/home/images/2001_nav_images/editable_images/many.jpg"><br><font size="3" face="Monotype Corsiva, AGaramond, Garamond, Times New Roman" color="#42035F"><i>--Harm me not, for I am as volatile as Nature Herself--</i><br>ai...yiyiyiyiyi....erp!</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzantesdarkwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zantes Darkwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ye Olde Gimp</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/9/02 5:48:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=561.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.orderofseibwen.com/picstorage/americanflag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Rain</span><hr size=1> Bravo!
