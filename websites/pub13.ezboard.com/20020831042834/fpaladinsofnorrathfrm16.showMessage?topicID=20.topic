Does anyone know if the mage pet damage shield is dispellable?  You probably want to dispell all the buffs you can, since he'll be hasted and all that.<br><br>It might actually be a rare time where using mana for DDs (Flame of Light or stuns) might be worth doing, although I'm not sure how bad their resists are.  You might still be better off saving your mana for heals, but the damage shield should certainly be considered in that equation.<br><br>I'd probably want to mem root so you can try to root and heal.  Helm healing might be a good thing to have on hand in case you run low on mana, assuming you can root the pet and get out of its spell casting range/line of sight.  Flash of Light is probably another good thing to have on hand.  Once again, resistances will come into play on that stuff.<br><br>I'd also want to know if the magician is allowed to rebuff the pet after you dispell it--if you're truly fighting the pet only then I would tend to say no.  Otherwise I would think the magician should be fair game, and in that case forget about the pet and kill the owner.  In a one-on-one I did with an epic magi someone advised me to root the pet and then go after the owner, but I tried root and it wouldn't stick, so I just let the pet beat on me while I hacked down the magi.  Wasn't that tough of a fight, although the person wasn't experienced with PvP either.<br><br>Also note that they're planning some changes to summoned pets where they'll take on the resistances of their owner.  That means if the magician puts on resist items the pet benefits from them.  They said this wouldn't affect PvP, but I'd wonder if that also means duels on blue servers.<br><br>Potions and other right click items might be your friend if they are allowed and you can get your hands on them.  There is a right click snare item in FG, if that (or root) lands you could probably try jousting the pet, although the DS would still apply unless you can in fact dispell it and the pet won't rebuff itself with it. <p><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131249>Duke Aalek</a><BR>60 Crusader<BR>Reign in Power<BR>Torvonnilous</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubalidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 694<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/22/02 11:26:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://saedyan.freeservers.com/images/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> Most Mages I know cheat by buffing and rebuffing and giving elemental blankets/defenders/etc to their pets, as well as very low delay weapons.

I got low on life but I killed it. Although with new pet resist changes you might not be able to chain stun it. A month ago though they had crap resists and you could always land stun blind root and so on. If you can not land anything on it this will be a tough fight, Mages continue to whine and complain about their class not being powerful enough, when in fact its one of the best classes now. <br><br>Between the need for mage mod rods to kill many high end mobs, as well as CoH to make raids possible, plus since their pet is so powerful and all they have to do is land any lvl spell for 1 dmg and they get full xp when pet does all the work, they are getting xp much faster than anyone else. Top it all off with the new resist changes to pets making it so nobody will be able to root blind or stun Jabober anymore. Well you have one really good class. <br><br>So far they have made Wizards very annoying with MB, on Druzzil Ro they have pretty much monopolized all the Kunark Dragons outside VP, as well as having the ability to take on Sontalak. Now they are making mages champs at raiding, pvp, and solo. I wonder if they are gonna continue the trend over at VI and give enchies and necros control over an entire aspect or two of the game, well I guess you could say enchies already are already the best class for grouping, so that just leaves necros, then the int casters will rule EQ!!<br><br>Hmmm, well I have just noticed that I have been ranting, my apologies I did not wish to do that, I just get a bit annoyed when I think about how unbalanced EQ can be, IMO they should be working on Beastlords, they seem to be the most broken class. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utebin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tebin</A> at: 7/24/02 12:16:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unevroneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NevronEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Of the Realm</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 2:59:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> if you think Necros need a helping hand in PvP Then Sir you are clueless.<br><br>They are hands down the most hard to kill int caster ever, You could call them the int casters paladin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br> <p>Nevron Justicebringer<br>Knight of Tunare<br>Wolves of Retribution<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=206650>My l337 Gear</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utebin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tebin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 11:48:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> I dunno about you but I never had any trouble with necros in duels, they may not be easy but they are not gods of the arena at any rate. Of the 4 int casters they are the hardest, maybe after mage epic pet starts resisting root and blind mages will become the hardest. However the necro just didnt seem to do damage fast enough to kill me. I think I will be taking a break from the PvP world, which we can choose to do on a bluebie server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Its just getting messed up right now.<br><br>I play on a blue server, Druzzil-Ro, and I used to duel alot and get into as many arena fights as I could, I have stopped dueling as much because I got into a good guild and now if I am not raiding with them I am trying to lvl so I am more useful. <br><br>Anyway back to the point, it used to be that when fighting a magician all you had to do was root or blind the pet and then chase the mage around, the best thing a magician could do was try to stay as near to thier pet as he/she could then nuke whenever it looked like they had time. Now however, since the pets will have the same resists as the magician, there will most likely be no more blinding or rooting the pet, and unlike you the pet will not waste an attack on being out of range, it knows when its close enough to attack. So while you are chasing this magician around, getting the &quot;You are out of range&quot; message over and over again since the mage is flailing around like a madman, his pet is hitting you for 65 over and over again, then procing for a 250 dmg stun occasionally. This is very very bad, pretty much the only thing we have left at this point is to get the Holy Steed, and make big loops around the mage and his pet, basically jousting the mage and pet, only the mage gets to land 800 pt nukes while you run away from the pet. <br><br>Any other ideas anyone? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unevroneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NevronEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Of the Realm</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/02 12:37:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> Of course Necromancers are not hard when you fight in a closed area.

Okay so mages will continue to be wusses in PvP. And yes you can say that a necro is hard in an open area, but then you can say a monk is hard in a very small area. I get annoyed when casters insist on fighting in Great Divide or South Karana. Why is it that we must duel on the necros terms. I have fought casters however that let me pick a spot and they pick a spot and we have two fights. When this happens I usually find myself in someplace like the Freeport arena for my fight, and in Everfrost while its snowing for their fight. I like fighting in the Bazaar, its small enough that they cant just go hide somewhere and med to full then give it another shot, but its large enough that they have room to run around and stay out of range. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uandercross.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andercross</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/30/02 11:35:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/ander/anderwish.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> Never thought of get'n DS potions to use against them) I'll have to try that, Brell knows they kill me enough. <p><center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/andercross/fullsize/woushisig.jpg></center><center><b><a>Andercross Lightbringer<Br><i>Cavalier o' Brell Serilis</i></b><Br><b>Giliath Lang</b> VZ</a><Br><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163702>My Magelo Profile</a></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uglidreon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glidreon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/26/02 6:05:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm16.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Duelling mage epic pet..</span><hr size=1> Destroyed a mage with Epic pet 2 days ago he basical conseeded.
