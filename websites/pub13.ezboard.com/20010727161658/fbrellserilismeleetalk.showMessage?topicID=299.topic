But first, to answer your question, yes, Fenye is retired almost completely. I don't plan on playing her hardly at all.<br>
<br>
My reasons....<br>
<br>
Well, when I hit 46 I was so overjoyed I could finally go to the Planes with my friends I immediatly jumped into Fear, and won a pair of Val boots. I was esctatic, and very proud of them.<br>
By the time I was 49, I still had those damn boots, and nothing else. But I was stoked about my new spells. Was long awaited that I could revive ppl.<br>
Now I'm 51, and dozens of Fear raids later, I'm very sad.<br>
First of all, I haven't been able to join a good guild, and when I do finally find one I like, something prevents me from joining. Either no officers ever get around to speaking/grouping with me, they won't accept me.. etc.<br>
I am getting laughed at with the crap I wear now. I see much younger paladins running around with thier Soulfires, near-full Valorium, etc. Now I have newbies trying to buy off my gear when they see me.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I really wanted to get my Fiery Avenger, it's the ultimate goal for me (as is alot of paladins), but is just about unobtainable right now. If I was to continue playing Fenye, she'd soon be out of the max level limit to go on Dragon raids, and with all the guilds killing the dragons for those books, by the time I'd actually get those two books I'd be level 60. It just ain't gonna happen.<br>
<br>
Another reason, is something seems to be wrong with the Valorium Drops. Everytime I go, I swear, NO Val drops, or one piece drops, and 5 paladins are rolling for it. The same time, TONS of Thorny Vine, Vermiculated, and Umbral armor is just raining down. <br>
<br>
I feel almost cheated, or chained up as to what I could do. I can't really get better equipment (which is a large part of going to the high intensity zones - or building up yourself so you can actually survive there), and I would have to give up my biggest dream to get past level 52. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I nearly cry at all the time I spent into Fenye, and I just wanna drive down and car-bomb Verant (of course I'm not gonna.. just emotions here). I look at all the other classes. And now I know what they mean when they say the life of a paladin is not an easy one. <br>
<br>
All the other paladins who have been around for a long time have thier Valorium and thier Soulfires, the mass amount of friends and allies who would help them with things..<br>
<br>
I'm still wearing my TinkerToy(r) Armor of Ro and wielding my little Blade of Xalgoz. <br>
<br>
As to why I chose a SK, well, it's pretty simple.<br>
The whole time I played Fenye, I was the good girl. I helped ppl when they didn't ask, I offered to loan them money before they even asked me, I sat around newbie zones to protect the younger characters for hours on end. I led a guild of kind, considerate and caring ppl for almost 8 months. For just about all of Fenye's career I've been helping ppl. And now when I need help the most, noone was there to offer. <br>
So I gave up being nice, and put Fenye on the back shelf, and started myself the evil version of Fenye - Asramael, the Shadowknight. I still miss having healing spells, and good buffs, and those good-girl tendancies still linger, but it's such a relief being evil than it is to help someone out who's just gonna turn thier backs on you when you need it the most.<br>
<br>
So, to put it in the short, Fenye is screwed. I can't do anything with her anymore, and I don't know the right ppl to help me advance her. <br>
<br>
So Ryklith, that's the long and short of it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>

They are extremely fun the first 20 times you do them, but it starts to feel to much like work after awhile.  As far as being in a guild to get your armor, well, that can work both ways.  I've seen people come outta independant raids with more armor because they got lucky with rolls.  It just depends.  Myself, it took me from January 1, to the end of March to get full Valorium.  And countless deaths =).<br>
<br>
<br>
A different alternative:  Deepwater armor !<br>
<br>
Granted, 2 of the pieces are on EXTREMELY hard mobs, but the rest is obtainable =).<br>
<br>
<br>
Fiery Avenger:<br>
<br>
Well, this is a class defining weapon.  Stat wise, it's VERY nice, but there are other alternatives to this particular weapon as far as effectiveness goes.  <br>
<br>
Granite Face Grinder, Jade inlade cresent Axe....just to name a few.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heck, the Granite Face Grinder has a better dmg to delay ratio !  =)<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, although you can't get the &quot;best of the best&quot;  there are other alternatives that make you just as compentent as the rest of us.<br>
<br>
  And it's not only items that makes the character great, it's the player behind him / her.<br>

I have no clue as to what is wrong, but every other class has been having armor drops like crazy, while Valorium and Carmine isn't dropping hardly at all. Tonights Fear raid yeilded ONE pair of Val boots. The one before that, no Val. Same thing with the raids before that. In fact, I've been constantly doing about 4 fear raids per week for two months straight, and I've only got one peice of armor, Valorium is just becoming such a rare drop now. And when there is, there is like 5 or 6 paladins rolling for it. Some ppl say it took them 3 to 4 months to get thier full suit of Val, but I have only got one peice in two months, whereas I see a ton of SK armor drop -- just a little more incentive to build up my SK.<br>
<br>
But the Fiery Avenger is my ultimate goal, it's not only the class defining weapon, but a dream of mine ever since I've heard the rumors about it, and now that I am strong enough to do the quest, I have very little time to do it, as the level cap for Dragon raids is really gonna screw me.<br>
<br>
I recently joined Imperium, and i really like the guild, but this game is really eating away at me, cause it's just getting to be more of a chore than enjoyment for me now. I'd love to start playing Fenye again for xp, those post 51 spells look *really* neat - but that's a long way away from now. <br>
<br>
Oh well, guess I just wasn't destined to play the Paladin. <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>

<br>
So you can continue to get levels, and not worry about missing out on the oportunity of getting a Fiery Avenger, because either Verant will re-open the Dragons to 53+ characters, or the quest components will be moved.  (Probably to something easier as well)<br>
<br>
Valorium Drops:<br>
<br>
I don't see anything wrong with this, from the past few Fear raids I have participated on, there seemed to be a decent amount dropping, (usually 2-4 pieces).  (In your case, this is where time starts to come into play, and why I prefer a loot list over randoming, it favors those that put a lot of effort into the planes over someone who just hit 46)<br>
<br>
You can also get Valorium greaves up in the Plane of Hate...(Along with a Darkmetal Holy Sprinkler, Theologian Claymore, and Trueheart Shield)  Shield of the Immaculate too, but that comes off of Inny =P<br>

Been to fear 15 times now and have one bracer, only seen 4 pieces TOTAl drop even...odd thing is though that i have umbral platemail greaves and vambraces and i'm not even a sk! thats how much THEIR armor drops.<br>
<br>
doesn't verant want to keep people happy so they can keep making money? doesn't seem that way, does it? Rykilth: deepwater is barely an alternative to val being that it is so hard to get and it also kind of sucks (accpeting of course the AC). the spells it casts are a joke (what the HELL? i mean SOOTHE??) and parts of it aren't even acquireable. the greaves and BP drop off mobs that haven't even been killed on Brell yet (granted Ryk they will probably first be killed by either LoH or SR, but they are still fairly impossible for the average paladin to obtain). oh...and the only piece of DW worth a damn...the deepwater HELM. *and like a thunderbolt from the heavens, verant kicked paladins in the groin ONCE MORE!!!* it made soloing possible!! i soloed in dreadlands for days gaining a bubbler opf exp by myself. and NOW they make the casting time not even worth the trouble. wooooo-hooooo thank you corporate dicks!<br>
<br>
with all this brewing i am seriously thinking of quitting EQ. i mean people, LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR LIVES! how much time a week do you spend on this pointless search for electronic armor and weapons? when it all boils down that IS the point of the game. by the way, did anyone read ragunablades going away thread? it made me think about my life and how this stupid game is affecting me. (did you know that tested IQ's drop during elongated periods of non-use and raise again when something mentally stimulating occurs within that humans life? EQ is basically a mouth wide open, drooling while slurping down a coke and eating potato chips type of a mental activity. any idiot can do it, and the best of the idiots can do it WELL). anyway if you want to read ragunablades post it's on skyre draneths homepage...i DO suggest you check it out.<br>

<br>
Deepwater Armor:  You want to know the easiest way to get this?  PURCHASE it.  It's not no drop like Valorium, it's tradeable, so save up that cash, or when you win rolls on items down the road, sell 'em, and buy your armor.  I won't deny the fact that yes, the Breastplate and leggings come off MoBs that haven't been bested yet on this server, but they WILL be killed.  And as I said in a post above, Valorium leggings can drop in HATE as well as Fear. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Deepwater helm:  This is a nerf that was long overdue, and I think all the paladins knew it, but refused to believe it was going to happen.  Well, it happened.  Nothing much you can do here, except roll with the blows and continue on.<br>

<br>
You make very good point.<br>
<br>
I've gotten all my Valrorium in my first 3 raids, nothing on my very first fear, which was a LOH raid, not cuz you didn't want me to have any, nothing dropped.<br>
<br>
I have valorium boots, greaves, vambraces and two bracers. Deepwater helm, and gauntlet, all I want is the Vaolrium bp.<br>
<br>
The reason I want to join a big guild (I hope it wasn't a secret I am trying to join LOH) is that at this level of game play, you need more than just luck, you need organisation and help to do the big stuff.<br>
<br>
Going in sebilis, chardok, karnor, howling stone, and the dreadful Veeshan peak alone is simply suicide.<br>
<br>
I believe a good part of the fun of playing is being part of a greater whole, and for some people a big part of their fun is different than my view of it.<br>
<br>
Well, I must say someone like you Rykilth makes for two things<br>
<br>
1.Jealousy<br>
<br>
2.admiration<br>
<br>
I've seen you seldomly, but I've always felt awed at your sight. I like to think I could stand up with you against common foes ( a lot preferable than standing against you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
and be a good team mate.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree with Fenye on a lot of points.<br>
<br>
But this game has showed me one true thing.<br>
<br>
The effort and time you put in aren't transformed in reciprocal enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Still I love it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Keep/6130/greenhead.gif" height=225 width=225>

After 23 raids, I finally got my second piece of Valorium. I'm just enthralled. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No, actually, it just puts me at wits end. I lost a bet with Tanari, which was that if I didn't get another part of Val, I could leave EQ and play another game. Because she likes this game so much, we made that deal. well hellfire, I lost the bet by winning Val (ok ok irony .. NOW), but that's not the point. <br>
<br>
<br>
So I should get a part of Val every 20 raids. Makes sense. doesn't it? I mean...*twitches* you see.. *twitches* other paladins *jerks and twitches* go do 5 or 6 raids and come out with *convuleses* full.. *spasms* VALORIUM ARGH I WANNA KILL EM ALL<br>

<br>
Why not concentrate on YOU having fun, not on what armour or lewt every other Tom, Dick or Sir Harry is wearing?<br>
<br>
A large proportion of your frustration with EQ seems (from this and your &quot;bye&quot; thread, amongst others) to come from the fact that your armour isn't as top-notch as everyone else's (apparently).<br>
<br>
It seems to me (and I'm just a humble bard who talks too much <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , but even so...) that if you concentrated on the cameraderie, the new experiences (not exp points), the guild banter (as an ex-Imperium member myself, I know how chatty they can be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and the role-playing, you might just enjoy EQ for what it's meant to be. It's not supposed to be an online virtual mall for nice-looking armour: it's a role-playing game.<br>
<br>
I won't go on: this is just my 2cp worth - given free to you.<br>
<br>
It's not a rant, not harrassment, not a cheap joke.<br>
<br>
It is simply a suggestion, made in good faith. You can take it or leave it: your call. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - Jester of Avalon<br>

Anyway, stick to it, the planes tend to seem like more work and less fun when you've been to them 2394828034 times.  (Unless your the puller of course)<br>

I'm SURE to get this one mixed up..both Rykilth AND Brinklith posted right after me.. so le's get this started.<br>
<br>
To Brinklith the Bard, yes you are very right, I was just really sad when I wrote that post cuz I was fartin around in Freeport and two paladins ran by me, TOLD me I needed to get a BP and Leggings of Valorium, and ran off, thier soulfires bobbing up and down.<br>
It made me angry and ashamed, cuz I'm 51 and I am still using middle level armor. No big deal, I guess, but the fact that younger paladins had better stuff than I did (which still doesn't bother me) and flaunted it in front of me was not only wrong and mean, but it made me feel like I am not doing a good job with my paladin character.<br>
But I will try to take your advice, and stop focusing on loot, and try to enjoy the game and the people within.<br>
<br>
To Rykilth the Paladin, hehe, yes, I plan on raiding Fear as much as possible, and I'm trying to be on the pull team as well. I pulled in Fear for the first time, and I think I did a great job, as I only died once in the beginning, when I was learning how to kite them (I'm a paladin damnit, not a druid!). But other than that, I LOVE pulling Fear. it's an adreneline rush, and it makes those long ass hours  in Fear MUCH MUCH more fun. Plus I can pull the mobs I want to. :P <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>

I'm still hella proud about my Ro armor, and although it doesn't offer as much protection as I'd like, it is still a symbol of my dedication and hard work.<br>
<br>
You can just say I wear full Ro armor, and I've recently replaced my boots of Ro and my Vambraces of Ro with Valorium. That's my stuff. Oh, I use a Hero Bracer and a RMB. All that looks nice (gotta look good) but it can't hold a candle to some of the mobs I fight now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>
