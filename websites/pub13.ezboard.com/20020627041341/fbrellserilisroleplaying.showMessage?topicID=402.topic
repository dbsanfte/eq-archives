Her head still throbbed from the drinks she had the night before, celebrating her move to the fourth round. Werane was sound asleep still on her small pile of blankets next to Tilana's bed, and nothing seemed like it would wake the tiny elf.<br>
&quot;Mornin', Lady Tilana. Might I have a word with you before the fourth round begins today? I know it's a bit early-&quot; the bard said, poking his head through the cloth opening of the tent.<br>
&quot;Mmmrf.. the hell are ye doin in my tent. Blast the Tribunal.. what is it ye want?&quot; she said, still rubbing the sleep from  her eyes. The bard allowed himself in, averting his gaze away from Tilana's bare body.<br>
&quot;I know you are a fierce fighter.. tis the reason you are here, but I'm afraid I won't be able to hold my own against this next round. It seems a bit harsh, even for a bard of my talents.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's supposed to be harsh, ya sissy. That's why it's called the Nine Hells. Besides, I kin do nothin fer ye this next round. We aren't even fighting together. It's another one on one match.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, actually my Lady, there is something you can do for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Den what is it ye want?&quot;<br>
&quot;I want to fight you.&quot;<br>

<br>
Later that morning, when the crowds began to stir again, a light rain fell over the sky, and slowly began to dampen the ground. The soft, brittle sands soon turned into mud, and nearly everyone sat under cloth aunings. With a loud crack of thunder, the rain turned into a downpour, and soon the arena was a soggy mess. The announcer called out that the fourth round would still go on, and this time, each contestant would be able to choose his or her opponent. The best fighters of the third match chose first.. if they were not chosen already by another of higher ranking.<br>
Tilana was the third one to choose, and like they had planned, she chose to fight the bard. She didn't know what he was up to, but she was sure that if he tried to pull anything on her, she would not hesitate to make him a twin.<br>
As the first match began, a rather slim human stepped into the ring. She was small in frame, but her swords were sharper than the look in her eye. In each hand she boasted a long, curved falchion type blade, and she wore no heavy armor, only the light chain of an agile fighter. She had performed exceptionally in past matches, and everyone was betting on her to win, until they saw her opponent she had chosen - a rather large and angry looking Troll. <br>
The troll was enormous, her height and half again, and more than twice as thick. In many places his unkempt armor was torn, with a thick muscle bulging underneath it. For the most part, his armor was heavy steel plate, though he wore no helmet and wore no boots. Small metal spikes had been welded onto his breastplate, shoulders and gauntlets or added ferocity - and lethality. He was known as Redrum, the beserker warrior from Grobb. Noone has survived his matches.<br>
The human stood defiant of his taunts on the other side of the ring, confident she will beat this large abomination of a warrior. <br>
Bets were quickly reconsidered.<br>
Tilana sat and watched as the battle began. The troll not even paying attention to the small woman, and merely raising his arms and weapons to the crowd for support and a quick ego boost. The crowd began laughing, not cheering, and when he turned his back the woman was gone. He let out a loud guffaw as he laughed, assuming the woman had fled.<br>
A swift round kick to his jaw shut up him. She appeared right in front of him, and broke a tusk with her powerful kick. Normally that kick would have snapped a man's neck, but to this giant it merely made his jaw pop. <br>
Infuriated, the troll lashed out with one of his hands, catching the woman in the back as she restabled herself from the kick. He gave her a hard push, sending her face-first into the muddy arena floor. She rolled to her knees, weapons held out at arms reach ready for a counterattack, but the troll didn't follow through. <br>
He held his halberd with one hand, and used his other hand as a second weapon. Twirling the halberd for added momentum, he struck low hoping to make the woman jump.<br>
As she hopped over his blade, he snatched her by the arm with his fist, and with a loud cry, he broke the arm with a simple turn of his wrist.<br>
The woman staggered back after dropping the weapon from her broken arm, taking the few seconds to recover and push aside the pain while the troll laughed at the woman. She didn't have much time, as the troll began to lumber towards her with a steady gait, spinning his halberd in a deadly dance.<br>
Tilana felt for the woman, she admired her courage in choosing the most powerful target, but she didn't want to see her die to this beastly looking troll. She glanced towards Werane, in an almost &quot;help her&quot; type of expression. When Werane's eyes lit up, her expression changed to that of puzzlement. The little elf disappeared in the crowd, so Tilana focused her attention to the battle once again.<br>
The troll was swinging his halberd viciously at the human, but even with a broken arm, she seemed surprisingly agile. Though she hadn't landed a blow on the troll yet, she was doing a splendid job of wearing him down.<br>
The woman pushed off one leg and slid beneath the troll's legs as the halberd crashed into the much. She laid on her back as she pushed her right leg straight up into his groin, denting the metal plates so badly it kept constant pressure even after she moved away. The Troll fell down, coughing from the aching pain, and the woman backed off a little bit and began to cast a healing spell  on her arm.<br>
The light soft blue glow trailed off her fingertips and focused on her arm, mending the bone somewhat. Though her arm still was of no use, at least she wouldn't feel the immense pain from moving around so much. The troll had managed to rip the cup off his armor, letting his genitilia hang free, but at least he was free of the pain. Once again he began to advance on the woman, this time moving a bit more quickly, hoping to end this battle and save some humiliation. Tilana saw the woman turn towards the crowd, then she held an object to her mouth and drank deeply from it. She started to double over, but quickly shrank to a mere few inches tall. She was, to everyone else, invisible. <br>
The troll, befuddled at what happened, looked angrily in the muck to find the woman. In a few moments, he began to scream in blood curdling pain as his own blood started to flow down his legs from his groin area. Frantically trying to get off his armor, he finally rolled onto his back, swatting at his midsection. In a few minutes, he lay still, and a tiny woman covered in troll's blood emerged from the hole in the troll's armor. <br>
Laughing and clapping her hands, Tilana stood to cheer at the woman, who was announced as the victor. <br>
In the few moments that the grief workers carried away the body from the pit, Werane skittered up to Tilana.<br>
&quot;Nice work, sis.&quot; Tilana said, patting the elf on the back. &quot;Wish me luck.&quot;<br>
Tilana rose off her seat and headed into the arena, where she took her side. She called out that the bard was the person she wanted to fight, and he too, stepped out to accept the challenge. She hardly recognized him though. Dressed in full plate mail, he brandished a short, mean looking spear in his main hand, and a small hooked knife in the other. His armor was so dark a blue that it was black in this rain. For the first time in her life she felt that her skills were not enough to over come the task at hand. Regardless, the announcer shouted out that the match was to begin. Now.<br>
<br>
The bard burst towards her with near blinding speed, so fast she almost did not have time to react. His spear was blocked by one of her short swords, but it was still a mere three inches from an opening in her coif. His accuracy was frightening. His hooked sword fought against her other arm, leaving a deadlock with his spear close to her neck. Planting a foot on his chest, she kicked him a few feet away to give her some breathing room and a chance to compose herself. <br>
Not giving any time away to waste, he launched in again, this time his spear sinking deep into her shoulder, drawing blood and pain from the wound. She grunted, and slashed a long shower of sparks against his arm with her sword. <br>
He brought around his hooked sword to cut at her midsection, but she raised her knee and shunned the blade away with her legplate. Countering the attack, she thrust the remaining shortsword at him, missing his head.<br>
Another kick sent the bard rolling and gasping for air, and she thrust her blade downward into his back, pinning him to the ground like a showcase butterfly. She thought about unleashing her axe to end his traitorous life, but maybe mercy was his plan, no matter who the victor of the fight would have been. That way, both of them would live. <br>
Her hesitation allowed the bard to sweep out with his sword, catching her by the ankle and slicing the achilles tendon, dropping her to the ground. Both were nearly screaming in pain, but the bard was recovering faster, despite still being pinned to the ground. That is it, she thought, I'm ending this now. She reached down to her boot and withdrew a long bladed dagger. Tossing it and catching it by the blade, she threw the dagger almost as soon as she caught it. The bard's head jerked back as the dagger's blade sunk into his eye, right through the visor on his helm.<br>
He ceased to move.<br>
<br>
She was proclaimed the victor of the fourth round, and with the aid of the grief workers, she was helped out of the arena to cure her wounds for the next match.<br>
<br>
Even above the pain, she felt the cold steel touching her breast, reminding her of the pendant she always wore.<br>
