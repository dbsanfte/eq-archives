<br>
Wise, you got any idea what kind of mana regen shamans got with the Canni line? Seriously? Anyone who suggest CH for shamans need to go talk to their local shaman about it and when he stopped rolling on the floor laughing about having CH and what he can do with it so can you talk some about mana regen...<br>
<br>
Now, lets move on. Something I keep seeing poping up is druids saying they can NOT heal good enough to keep random_player_01 in. Usually they compare themself to healing the MT (lets say 6.5k for a easy low number these days) or rampage/secondary MT (also at 6.5k hp). Now, on a raid with something rampaging (Archie, Rhag2, anything that wont be slowed and cripple wont land on/stay on) big time so will ONE druid not keep it up, I would even dare to say two druids would have a hard time (depending on the magic dice, defensive yada yada yada) to keep it up. I dont think anyone is going to question that either. The thing that seem to be the common mistake though is saying this is ONLY about high end raiding or everyone will end up in high end raiding only. That is false, you will all end up doing exp for the simple reason you want to regain those four deaths learning mr AoW ver. 2.0 that decided to stomp your raid a few times before you killed him. Any form of direct heal will impact the regular exping, lets not stick this under the chair.<br>
<br>
The story behind CH was that it was intended as a non combat healing spell (therefor the long casting time) and it was of limited use (though I CHed that 1500hp monk when I got it and though I was mana efficent, those where the days), as everything moved on so did the tanks HP and it became a corner stone to cleric healing. Well all know what happend etc etc. Now, CH is not a true complete heal (aka 100% heal of target), it is a 10k heal (10.5k with the 5% bonus). Not knowing what VI can and can not do so will I make a assumption that VI can NOT make a true % heal atm. They can only do a coded number heal (aka you heal for 5k not 50% of target etc) so does that leave a problem. How do you make a heal (and healing is what usually is brought up) that dont balance regular exping (where single druid can do the job in most zones, shamans in even more and the idea was that two of them where suppose to replace a cleric which is not the case today due to "insert random long list of caster complaints on mudflation") but still bring them in line on raids?<br>
<br>
Some druids say they want CH, I say take it so I can do something else then sit in the CH chain. Let the druids do that (;. I am willing to bet most druids will be coming screaming after you done that for half a year or so. There is hands down nothing as boring as sitting in a CH chain and 99% of all tactics is based on some form of CH chain... But then I want to be getting some real solo/group abilities in return so I can bring something to the other spectrum of the end. I dont think many clerics would turn down trading "raid power" to be less of a demand raiding wise (guilttrips etc is daily for many clerics if they simply not feel like raiding that night) for some more group/solo power. Where druids got very good solo/group power (guess this will be flamed and nitpicked by two sides, you can quadders and the we can quadd but class X do exp faster) but want more raiding power. I love if I instead of having to bring my cleric to the raid this night could bring out my ranger because instead because we had enough clerics for the core healing needed and got enough replacement druids to take up the slack in the other end.<br>

Druids have always had DoT power fairly close behind shaman and necros.   Compare the DoTs available to the three classes at level 53, when we get Winged Death, for example.<br>
<br>
Now look at the DoTs that shaman and necros get at 59-60, where the damage is in the 2000-2100+ range.  A druid swarm upgrade at 59-60 in the 1950-1980 damage range puts us back to where we are supposed to be in relation to shaman and necros (based on where we have been from levels 1-53).   A DoT with this damage range is also right in line with our the progression of our swarm line.<br>
<br>
How maintaining one's relative position is stepping on someone's toes is beyond me.<br>

At last a cleric that understands that their CHs are the chains binding them, and that giving CH to other classes (like shaman or druids) would free them from the monotony of sitting in a CH chain.  A monopoly on CH => boredom in gameplay.<br>
<br>
And I agree that giving CH to the other priest classes would require giving clerics some enhancements in other areas.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ul1nd4r4.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L1nd4r4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 9:53:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What about this...</span><hr size=1> &quot;I think I saw this coming. Go read EQ Cleric. You will see an increasing number of posts regaurding clerics wanting more self-reliance (solo ability/utility) because thier grouping opprotunities are drying up slowly.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  What I saw with Luclin's release was the number of druids drasticaly decrease and the number of clerics drasticaly increase.  Many people had clerics as primarys but were at 60 and there wasn't any point in playing them so were off on alts and things they enjoyed more, like druids.  With Luclin's AA xp suddenly there are clerics everywhere as people were back playing their primary to get MGB and such.  Since Luclin a &quot;/ all cleric 60&quot; will pretty much always return a full list and &quot;/ all druid 60&quot; won't, which is the reverse of how it was before Luclin.<br>
 <br>
  So yes, clerics have a lot of competition for groups.  But is it any surprise?  A raid NEEDS 4 or 5 clerics.  People that don't even like playing clerics do it for their guild.<br>
 <br>
  Off topic but one thing that strikes me is that while meleers can bash high level mobs, stuns which were a cleric's domain for low level stuff has no effect.  I don't understand why clerics don't get high level stuns like enchanters get rapture and the high level mezzes.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Melee's are more and more being able to solo effectively, for exping people are prefering more small 2-3 man teams in &quot;safe camps&quot; where literally any healer will do up to an including paladins rather than hitting things like Ssra, new CT, etc.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A lot of time is spent in easy to get to xp grinds that are tedious, boring and easy, like FG, ME etc. where a meleer's power does mean any healer will do, yes, and often none at all.  Rangers and warriors can proc 50% slow, bards have slow, no idea what, probably 60%, and coupled with good AC and class damage avoidance/mitigation weak xp mobs are a pushover they can recover from easily with BPs or fungal tunics, lifetapping procs or whatever.  Monks who can stand the boredom of playing solo I have no idea why they'd ever group with anyone other than another monk.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Until recently I thought giving druids better healing would simply marginalize clerics in more zones (still probably will) and since it really is the thing we have going for us it puts a lot of clerics on the defensive.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Better healing on druids probably would reduce clerics grouping opportunites even more, although thats happening every day as more and more shamans hit 60 and suddenly become godlike.  However they'd still be required on raids and druids would still be something better left at the char select screen in favor of any other class.<br>
 <br>
  Clerics definetly do need to be looked at for a fun/playability factor.  I'll even agree they need more/better heals.  But for any zone where mobs actually hit hard you're going to want a cleric or shaman + paladin.  As for soloing though, clerics can do it.  Even before portstones clerics could solo.  The xp rate sorta sucks even more than the standard sucking of hours to get an AA point, but any class that can keep a nonsummoning mob rooted long enough to med back the mana it cost to root it can probably kill it.  Of course after the 5 minute fight you then get to watch TV for 10 minutes while you get your mana back. =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalyenatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talyena Trueheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 10:07:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What about this...</span><hr size=1> On DOTs, they would be great, they would make sense, they would do nothing to address the major problems that druids are having in the high end raiding game. The same druid that tags along to cast seasons could dot as well.<br>
<br>
Druids getting CH is the only real way to balance healing, but I don't see it happening and not really sure I would want it to. If it doesn't happen druids will always be way behind the healing power of a cleric. Perhaps if VI had thought about balancing before giving clerics CE, they could have passed a spell like that to the druids and given clerics a nice 2-3k heal that is much faster than CH. That would have given both classes a unique healing role while still keeping clerics by far the masters of direct healing. But that cat is already out of the bag and giving us something as good or slightly better than CE would upset the clerics to no end so that isnt an option at this point.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can see happening now is to tweak the basic high end heals and maybe removal of the penalty and looking a different direction for druids other than backup healers. Maybe by giving druids small lure type nukes we can secure a small spot as even better damage dealers just shy of what a wizzie can do. Wizzies would still be better with their specialty nukes, more crits, and skills such as manaburn, but maybe there is something unique damage wise that we could do to help out on raids. Other than that I am clueless as how you make druids more raid oriented without overpowering what is already a nice versitile class outside of raiding. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>

Me too. Over the past year, I have been watching melee get more powerful simply by leveling. Basically melee damage is unresistable and unlimited, disciplines are unresistable, and disciplines and aaxp skills are automatic upon reaching the right levels. <br>
<br>
Casters damage is resistable, limited by mana, based on arbitrary drops of spells. Only aaxp skills are automatic though. The only caster with enough damage potential to play at the high end is wizard because VI has specifically given then criticals and unresistable spells. <br>
<br>
All other classes have been relegated to finding some sort of role supporting the MA. Shaman slow, chanters buff, druids buff, clerics chain cheal. <br>

Clerics have the skills and the spells to be able to solo, be needed in exp groups, to make or break a raid and most of all have fun. It's up to the individual to not make themselves so restricted in their abilities.<br>
<br>
An example: There's a cleric in my guild who solo's whenever he gets the chance. He finds it relaxing to get away from raids and exp groups and enjoys the challenge of actually being able to solo as a cleric. We're constantly giving him new mobs to try and solo and crack up when he dies or gates but he gloats for days when he wins (rightly so!). On raids, he's not always stuck in the CH rotation, he nukes, stuns (when that's possible) and pulls off the most amazing saves at times. He loves AE groups, gets to ae stun, ae nuke, group heal and save our butts when we are about to die. He pulls out his pet (yes a cleric who actually uses his pet!) on mini bosses just for the fun of it. I teased him yesterday on our forums that I'd make him into a special news feature if his pet ever got the kill shot. Well, sure enough it got the kill shot on an Umbral rare last night. He'll be rubbing that one in my face for months I'm sure. Imagine our pet getting a kill shot (yeah right). He also gets to go to zones constantly that I'm only asked along on with my monk "bring Joolz, not the druid" for obvious reasons.  There's no other class that's power restricted so much in zones than druids. Clerics are restricted from no zones whatsoever. <br>
<br>
So, like I said..I don't buy it. If you're not having fun with your cleric you need to be playing something else. Like someone else said, since Luclin the increase in clerics has been huge. Before we were lucky to have 3 clerics per raid, now we have 6 or more and when we had 5 druids per raid now we have 1 maybe.  <p><br><br><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117440" TARGET="_NEW">Seriena,</A> 60 druid<br>

Sorry to burst your bubble Kahlus, but in Valoran there are only two druids with Moonfire as of yet.<br>
<br>
Granted, that is partially because we're busy getting melee_105 their ST key so they can have primal.  Druid damage doesn't matter. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

<br>
your post just prove how balancing is hard to do ;-)<br>
<br>
In some sense i agree with you i dislike the large raid<br>
idea, but this way of playing is now how people do.<br>
<br>
At some point years ago verant did a mistake, they made most of the high end encounters undoable by a 6 people group. <br>
<br>
The second mistake was complete heal that as you mentionned was not introduced as a combat spell but as a downtime reducer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Post 50 the major problem is that challenging encounters<br>
are Metal based (which mean you need clerics and may be a cleric chain, and sometimes slow, and melee damage dealer).<br>
<br>
This is not the case in the pre 50 game. <br>
<br>
This problem affect all the non holy classes (tanks, hubrids, monks, enchanter shamen clerics)<br>
and mage wizzard and druids are in trouble. <br>
<br>
<br>
Verrant effort to make mage and wizzard more usefull in typical post 50 encounters is clear, even if i m not sure that<br>
i would be happy to trade my druid for a mage .<br>
<br>
The picture is very complex, but what i m sure is that Verrant will never be able to balance the post 50 game if they don't include CHeal, slow and haste in their equations.<br>
