<br>
                          Prologue<br>
The peaceful tranquility of the night sky was suddenly interrupted by a flash of light, followed the sudden rumble of thunder not too far away. An owl watched from her midnight perch high above the streets below, sheltering her children from the coming storm. She nervously hooted, gazing along the ground and swiveling her head in all directions, only the instinct of her newborns kept her from fleeing, sensing danger all around. The thudding of guardsmen’s boots against the cobblestone marching in a steady rhythm was the only sound, save for the occasional crackle of the heavens, the guards finding the correct path, started towards a house.<br>
A mother, father and child lay huddled together in the darkness. Crack. Crack. Crack. The oak door that had protected their small three-room dwelling for so many years was now violently creaking inwards. The door suddenly burst inward, its iron hinges suddenly snapping from the force of an armored boot finally breaking through. A barbarous man looking crazed in the low light flowing through the broken doorlooked about wildly, and sneered when he saw inhabitants. The father of the family cringed. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Get up.” The man hissed, not asking for compliance, simply giving a command; motioning to the huddled family in the darkness.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The father slowly rose, stepping in front of his still shuddering family. He calmly looked to his wife and longed for just an extra second, and then looked to the family cellar which they often stayed during the harsh winter months. His wife nodded. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I ask of thee why thou should come upon us this night, as to why you interrupt our slumber.&quot;, said the father.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You will address me as ‘Sir.’” The guard replied. “I did not endure the hardships of military life to be talked down to by the likes of you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The father looked down to his wife, with a longing that only years of love could create. His wife started up at him, her eyes glazed over with tears. The father knew what he had to do.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I stand before thee sir, unarmed.” Began the father, emphasizing sir as best he could without sounding offensive. “Let us be, we mean no harm on such a stormy night, give us time to collect ourselves and let us meet in the morning.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His wife, hidden from view through her husband took one last fleeting glance at the man who she loved so dearly, and silently opened the cellar trapdoor beneath her. Still hidden from sight, she lowered her baby son through the floor to set atop a half eaten box of dried fruit; the last of the family’s resources for the coming winter. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You have failed to pay your taxes for the last time. “ answered the guard, completely at ignorance to the father’s statements. “It is my duty to apprehend you and your family and see that you are evicted, if you do not pay me in coin, your house and labor shall pay your debts itself in name of the King.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The King’s taxes are absurd!” The father shot back, “I will pay no such taxes.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then I am afraid to do this to such a man,” the guard answered, “I am afraid that is simply not acceptable. I have heard great stories of you, and although I am sorry to have to evict you, I have no choice. “<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I will not go willingly” the father whispered, slightly drawing forth his rapier from the scabbard.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then I will have the honor of dueling one of the greats, although I will hate to strike you down, I will love the popularity that this brings me.” The guard responded to the father’s challenge as code dictated, and pulled forth his sword as well.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Catapulted by the sound of the mother closing the trapdoor as she gracefully slid through the opening, the men drew their swords and charged in the few paces between them. The steel in her husband’s hands sung like the sun breaking through a cloud, but as she longed to watch her husband, to know if he would become victorius, she could not look back. She quickly began throwing boxes away from the outside cellar entrance, and banged on the outside door to the cellar which had gone unused for so long. Looking up through the cracks as she furiously threw herself against the barrier she could see her husband's feet shuffle atop the wooden slats and drop dust down below. Finally with one more blow she hurtled out of the storeroom gasping to catch her breath. Looking around terrified, she clutched her baby child in the moonlight tightly to her chest as she looked through the rain for somewhere to go. As her footsteps echoed in the lanterns and pouring rain she could still hear the clash of metal and shouts as more city guards stormed into the house that had sheltered her so long. She thanked the raindrops, for it was all she could to pretend that it was only rain that trickled down her cheeks.<br>
