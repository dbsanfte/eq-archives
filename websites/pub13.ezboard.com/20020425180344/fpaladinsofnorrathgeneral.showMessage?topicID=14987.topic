I've read in various places that there is a &quot;soft-cap&quot; of 1100AC, meaning that anything above that really doesn't help much, similar to the old 200 INT/WIS cap that they recently did away with (to some extent).  However, in the mid-level game you're usually not at that level, so a nice AC boost does help, a lot.<br><br>I've also seen posts that there are thresholds, like going over 900 or 1000AC can make a noticeable difference when fighting exp mobs appropriate for your level, although I don't know if these &quot;magic numbers&quot; have any validity.<br><br>In the high end game, it's not uncommon to have reached or surpassed the 1100AC mark.  At that point, other stats, hit points being a prime example, help a lot more than raising AC.  The high end encounters also change--when raiding, a paladin is often not the main tank, and if you don't get hit, well AC didn't help you much did it?  Many of these encounters have Area of Effect damage spells though, which again are not affected by AC.  Having higher hit points (and higher resistances) allows you to survive longer, higher WIS might give you enough mana to get off an additional heal, etc.<br><br>It also becomes increasingly common as you reach the high levels that you'll be with clerics who complete heal, at which point having higher hit points makes those complete heals more mana efficient.  Even if you're taking slightly more damage, your increased hit points might make up for it in those situations.  <br><br>If your hit points aren't at the level where complete heals make sense to use from a mana efficiency point of view, or if you solo or group with healing classes other than clerics, then AC (damage mitigation) would help more than hit points.<br><br>I think the bottom line is that AC is king up to a point--at that point it starts taking a back seat to other things.<br><br>Aalek<br>59 Knight<br>Reign in Power <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthorena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thorena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/22/02 5:46:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14987.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AC vs Stats revisited...not an equipment check :)</span><hr size=1> Based on what Ive been able to gather its AC vs Mobs Attack rateing.

Added HP and the reduction/elimination of being stunned from normal frontal attacks by many average mobs i.e. not bosses (the second point is debated but I have seen a large decrease in stuns<br><br>AGL if below 75 then 5 points are needed to &quot;fix&quot; the deficit.  The difference in AC made from 70 to 75 is often 40 to 60AC by the time you reach 50s.  Also further increases do increase AC but by such negligble amounts as to not be over concerning.<br><br>DEX is important to paladins since we get self procs and several of our holy swords make use of procs.  Also Dex helps in channelling spells.  A necro friend decked out in good dex gear is often quite able to still get barrages of spells off even with multiple dungeon creatures beating on him.<br><br>WIS is important cause we have some very nice spells which are VERY expensive to cast.  The healing wave spells are major mana hogs but are of such use on AE raids that they can literally turn a battle around.  Also we get many clerical buffs which due to hybrid penalty cost us 1.5 times the normal amount clerics pay.  And considering clerics complain about mana usage on buffs think of where that leaves us.<br><br>INT not so important to us but it does aid in the learning of skills.  If your working on a craft skill or even a weapon skill higher int has been linked to faster learning.<br><br>CHA Again not such a big deal for us except to make some extra money and get better deals off vendors.  However as Act of Valor is picked up as an AA skill I would like to see how CHA affects our chances of successfully coming back via the cleric Deathpact spell.  Awhile back there was heavy debate in the chanter and cleric forums that high charisma increased the odds that someone would bounce back after death from the Deathpact spell if they had higher CHA.  So this may end up being an important stat at the very end game.<br><br>Anyhow my point is while AC is indeed importantant if your faced with an armor choice where you could shave a few AC for some superb stats I would take the stats 9 times out of 10.  Couple that with the fact that most Velious and Luclin Armors come with stats anyhow it really become less of a sacrifice in the end.  Kunark armor was on the whole one of the silliest designs for armor I ever thought of, barring the BP legs and Helm (due to its effect). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubizomb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bizomb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 822<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/22/02 8:09:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14987.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AC vs Stats revisited...not an equipment check :)</span><hr size=1> Ac is king, but don't sacrifice all else for it. <br>Try to get as high ac armor as you can find.

Here FT items mean a lot more, anything that can keep you up longer means more.<br><br>A history of worth....in the very beginning it was ac(beta, early retail), back when most peole were going for stats. Then my focus shifted to getting more wisdom(level 50 fear era), then went on a hp craze(level 50 pre kunark). Then the shift was back to getting ac(mid 50s early kunark), then went on a hp craze(level 60 late kunark, velious era), now im back to shifting to mana/wisdom/mana regen again(late velious, luclin era). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utramausvoronadil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tramaus Voronadil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/22/02 11:32:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14987.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AC vs Stats revisited...not an equipment check :)</span><hr size=1> I have to say, I was getting a bit discouraged looking at all the high level profiles and then seeing my stuff. So I have to say your post did indeed give me a bit of hope, being I’ve been looking for that balance as of late (lack of money is depressing).<br><br>In any case since this isn’t an Equipment Check post/forum I won’t link my Magelo profile here (I’m still working on it anyway). But this AC discussion did bring up two questions:<br><br>There are two pieces of armor I’ve been thinking of replacing with better stats armor after I buy my FBSS (1.5K more to go (4K on my server)):<br><br>Deepwater Gauntlets – Gauntlets of the Black<br><br>Greaves of Ro – Crustacean Greaves<br><br>As a Half-Elf I NEED stamina, and the STR/WIS on the Gauntlets would be nice (and needed now that my Helm of Ro has been replaced with DW). So my question is this, I lose 1 AC on each of these items but gain stats that I definitely need. Should I go for this? I’m not going to ask for further suggestions because as I said, I’m just wondering if the above is a good example of “give a little AC and get back good stats.” Thanks.<br><br>Tramaus Voronadil<br>45th Paladin of Truth – Order of Marr <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/3.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?
