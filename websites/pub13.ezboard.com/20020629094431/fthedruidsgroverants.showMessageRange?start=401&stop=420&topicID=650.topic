align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I couldn't agree more with this (the petition, not the post above).<br>
<br>
I've shut my druid down, at level 52.  I don't see anything to look forward to in the levels ahead.  Sure, I get a dot upgrade at lvl 53, and some nifty buff spells down the road, but for the work required to level, it's such a diminishing return...<br>
<br>
Often, I am called on to be one of several backup healers on raids, or many times, the main healer in xp groups.  In the xp groups, I am barely hanging on....and this will get worse as the tanks gain in level, and the targets we face hit harder and harder.  As for nukes, dots, etc...I'm definitely not a viable second choice to handle these...in many cases, not even a third.  Wizards, Mages, Shamans, and Necros all have me beat by a good margin.  So why continue to grind away at xp, when it's only going to get worse?<br>
<br>
Any changes along these lines will help make druids 'groupable' again.  Good luck druids...hope it happens for us.<br>
<br>
Regarding the post above...shamans solo as well, if not better, than most druids.  Also one of the most desirable classes to have on a raid.  Being good at soloing and good at grouping/raiding should not be mutually exclusive.  There should be a difference in the proficiency of each class when it comes to soloing vs. grouping/raiding, but the balance should not be so out of whack that a class is incapable of one of the other. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujispstormcaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JispStormcaller</A> at: 4/9/02 2:45:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zannadar>Zannadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 5:39:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=403>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> eh</span><hr size=1> see...this is certainly what I do not understand, I have no idea why other classes come to this board to cry and scream about druids shouldn't get anything...I mean think other classes and the game could actually benefit from the druids maybe...Maybe it's gonna be an ability/spell you'll love, what's this crying about?

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Quad kiting and ports seem to be the reasons why everyone hates druids so much.  Let me tell you, quad kiting is boring.  It was nice to try it for the novelty and it is fun to be able to say you can kill 4 mobs at once but honestly I play everquest  as a social game not to sit alone staring at my mana bar.  I will not quad my way to 60 and if that means starting over than so be it.  I will stop playing my druid when I can't find groups any more, from the looks of this board that will be around 51-52.  WHY is everyone so jealous of quad kiting?  It is boring, boring, boring and not as fast as a good group.  <br>
<br>
Ports:  they are nice for a casual player like myself...when I only have 2 hours to play it is nice not to have to spend 30 minutes trying to get to my hunting spot.  However, I would gladly give self ports to every casting class if it meant getting something that would make me more desirable in a group.  I know this isn't going to happen and I am probably going to have to scratch my 25 days played and start a cleric or a shaman.  But really guys the jealousy over the ports is rediculous.  &quot;Sorry no one likes you at level 60, but guess what you have PORTS so that makes up for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
For those of you who say druids are a solo class:  Well I started my druid because I wanted to be a PRIEST of nature.  I knew nothing about ports.  I knew nothing about quad kiting.  I knew nothing about sow.  As a priest I should be able to HEAL and better than a hybrid class.  No I don't want to be a cleric.  I don't want Cheal, I don't want to be as efficient or as powerful as a cleric.  You know I like clerics but I do not think that clerics should demand that EVERY group need a cleric.  Sure they are going to be the most desirable healer no matter what especially since they have rez.  Just like warriors are still the most desirable tank even though a paladin or shadownight can tank fine in an exp group (and I've been in  groups with a MONK tank for goodness sake, but you don't see warriors complaining about not being wanted for groups), I should be able to heal a group when a cleric cannot be found.  <br>
<br>
As it stands, at level 41 with greater healing, this is getting to be difficult and waiting until 51 for my next healing upgrade is unimaginable.  The last group I was in, it took me almost as much mana to heal the tank in a single fight as it would for me to solo a single mob.  That is just sad.  You can forget using all my great utility spells--if lucky I was able to snare the mob before it died.  We recruited a 36 cleric who was really too low for the zone but could still heal better than me.  <br>
<br>
I know this particular petition does not ask for heals for exping (although I do think that druids need superior healing earlier), but I just wanted to respond to all the clerics who think that they are undesirable.  Clerics, I understand you are undesirable at aaxp grinds at level 60.  However this is due to the poor design of aaxp that leaves many 60s able to solo easily.  Getting angry at your fellow priests for wanting to be able to secondary heal at raids is not going to change the fact that 60 meleers can solo and don't need healers.<br>

As for the request made by the Druid Community they are inline with and not overpowering for End Game - Many things now can be released such as the 10 % healing penalty with AA points or Level Restrictions. Many of the other can be directed towards raid only Druids - <b>tho I do not wish that upon our Class</b>, it is up to Verant to allow or disallow such things - We present the petition, and as all petitions go we have strong advocates for it and against it, though you are in the minority and do get off on this entire conversation.<br>

I don't mean to demean you but you just need to relax a bit and look at the big picture - all your see'ing it from is your own part of the world - you can have 14 computers playing each class and claim your an expert - but growin up with the class understanding each change and how each spell is effected by all the different faculties of the game is something that you just can't do by playing a level 60 Druid that your friend let you borrow. I won't sit here and tell you my experience but you must know I am versed in many different classes... does this make me an expert as you claim to be?? Heck no - <br>

I can say the same thing to every single person that posted that Druids can do X.  <br>
<br>
I don't play a druid in EQ I am a druid in EQ.  I play a cleric, a bard, a mage, a sk, a monk, a warrior, a rogue ect.. but they aren't even important enough to me to make my sig <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My druid is the character I WANT TO PLAY.  Pardon me for wanting her to experience EQ the best it can be.  <br>
As to easy to play maybe /shrug I have over 100 days /played on my 54 druid and only 45 (?) days /played on my 53 cleric maybe someday they will catch up with each other I donno, if I continue to be requested to play a cleric on a raid then I'm sure the cleric will catch up.  <br>
<br>
As for clerics and groups at level 30 /laugh the only advantage a druid has getting groups then is the ability to port to another zone when its obvious every group has a &quot;healer&quot;.  Until lvl 39 and superior healing is given to Clerics the differences in the healing classes are not very apparent to non healers.  At lvl 39 is when no one /ooc looking for healer they start /ooc looking for cleric and continue that trend to level 60. <p><CENTER>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I've read a number of posts here. I have also read many of the opinions from the petition as to what druids need to be a balanced class. I believe that some points are being missed by many on both sides of the issue. One being that a druid petition, or any class petition for that matter, does not mean that another class does not have a valid complaint on how they stack up in the game. This is group of druids asking for changes to their class. Another point is that, while taken one at a time, any one of these changes would be a welcome addition to the druids abilities but all together it is to much to give to any single class. Let be break down my thoughts on this subject.<br>
<br>
Healing: By definition, of the class roles, the domain of the cleric. Paladins, being a warrior/cleric mix, share many of the abilities linked to their parent classes. Spells like group heal and complete heal are best left to the clerics. In no way should ether of these spells be giving to ether the shaman or the druid in any form. Shamans and Druids both have the regeneration line that the cleric class does not have. That being said I believe that Natures Touch should have its casting time reduces slightly. Maybe no more then 1 to 1.5 sec off. This would allow Druids to heal a caster who had gained agro fast enough to keep them alive without taking away from the clerics roll at keeping the tanks alive. No additional healing is needed for the druid. While your looking at casting times you may look at the 1.5 min recast time on our 60th level regeneration spell. A shorter recast time would add to the usefulness of this spell.<br>
<br>
Direct Damage: By definition, again by class roles, the domain of the wizards. Raw magical damage should always be left in their hands. This is not to say they should master every aspect of direct damage. The mage bolt line should always be left to the mages. I do agree that moonfire is a good addition to the druids spell line and, once the spell becomes more available, will give us all the direct damage we should have. That being said I honestly think direct damage, as a whole for all classes, is something that needs to be looked at. Mobs with 100k+ hit points are just laughing off all but wizards these days for direct spell damage.<br>
<br>
Buffs: Again by definition this has been the domain of the Shaman. While the Cleric hit point buff is the best in the game no single class buffs like the Shaman. The only real improvement I can see here, outside of giving us a single version of PotG, is allowing PotG to stack with both Cleric and Shaman buffs. As it is now the 450ish hit points on PotG does not come close to being desirable to most classes even with the 6 point mana regeneration. To many want the 1000+ hit points from the Cleric buff. And by stacking with everything I also mean the Cleric's self only mana regeneration buff. At 60th level are we really worried about the extra 6 mana regeneration unbalancing the high end game? An even better change would be a little farther in reach. Why does our shield spells change upon reaching higher levels? First it our buff just gave hit points and armor class. Later a regeneration component was added to it. With PotG this was changed from a hit point regeneration to a mana one. If stacking issues are involved thing why not go back and change all the druid group spells to add a small amount of a mana regeneration. Starting with flowing thought 1 and working its way up to the 6 point mana regeneration that PotG currently has. This would make druids desirable for normal group as well. For stacking issues a removal of the armor class bones could be removed or even the hit point component to people thinking it would be to powerful. I do also realize that this could anger many enchanters but for mana buffs that would stack with all forms of clarity I honestly do not see anyone picking multiple of ether class instead of the other. If we are honestly looking to make Druids more desirable on raids this will be one of the main areas that needs to be looked into. The biggest thing is that our skin line be allowed to stack with the Clerics line even if no change is made to the spell itself. In no way should we get a group strength or agility spell. Lets leave the group stat buffs to the classes that already have them.<br>
<br>
Damage over Time: By definition the domain of the Necromancer. If you look at all the damage that can be done over time, taking all stacking available for that single class, you can see how they are the masters of damage over time. Our own magic line is, in my opinion, just fine for our overall role in the game. I do believe, however, that our fire/debuff dot could stand one upgrade around the 58+ area. I am sure the number crunchers would have a better understanding of what the damage/mana on a spell like this would be. I'm just suggesting that an upgrade may be in order.<br>
<br>
Ports: By definition the domain of both the Wizard and the Druid. In reality the Wizard far outshines us in this area now. That being said I believe both Wizards and Druids should get group ports to different areas of the moon. Enough to allow us to get a raiding group back up there in the event that they wish to raid somewhere else. Even more practical is this would allow a single group to hunt a zone without having to deal with 15 min worth of downtime just to get back to the moon. Give a group port to the Nexus to the Wizard and one going to Katta to the Druid. Maybe add another Wizard one in Sanctus Seru and a Druid one in Shadeweaver's Thicket. This would give people options to move around a bit faster while still giving the Wizards sole domain over the Nexus.<br>
<br>
Debuffs: No real definition on whose class job this is that I could think of. Surly both the Enchanter and the Shaman bring many useful spells here to a group. I would have to say our one debuff spell is very useful in the right situation much the same as any debuff spell. While a cold version would be nice for us here I could see this more of a Shaman line as they have more cold based then we do. But again they have a few debuff spells to cast already adding another may be overall better going to another class. I would think, however, that any such spell would be similar to Ro's in ability and resists.<br>
<br>
Charm Animal/Plant: Clearly a Druid's domain. I don't think anyone can reasonably deny us this roll. The main problem here is mainly the lack of mobs that can be charmed. The one plant charm spell we do have is to low to charm even a mushroom in The Deep. Most would never even cast this spell by the time they get it. Our animal spells are actually very useful once you learn how to use them. While many argue that the animal should not attack us we must also look at the fact that we are bending their will to ours. I don't think any would say that it shouldn't upset them. At our highest we do learn to ask an animal for its assistance without angering them, provided that they were not angry to begin with, in the form of Tunare's Request. Outside of maybe an upgraded plant charm I can really see no improvement outside of adding more animals to the game that our abilities are usable on.<br>
<br>
Our Epic Weapon: This was a very useful item before making mobs completely immune to snare/root. I believe both Necromancers and Druids should have the snare effect taken off and allow their dots to stack with not only the other lines they have but with each other. I do agree that in no way should all but the biggest mobs in the game be resistant to an epic weapon. How would many other classes feel if suddenly there were mobs that were immune to their own epics? Tank classes would always miss while using it? The Mage pet would always miss and the mob would just ignore it? Mobs would hit the Wizard just as if the shield spell was not there? I do agree that any form of manaless damage makes an awesome effect but lets try and keep the epic weapons useful. Simply removing the snare component will keep them from being useless for many of this new breed of immune mobs.<br>
<br>
Utility Spells: Spells like Spirit of the Wolf, Damage Shield, ect. have become somewhat of a sore spot for many a Druid. Most classes now have some form of these spells that out does ours. Personally I can only think of one change that would make me jump for joy with this line of spells. Wolf form and agro. Every Druid here that has played the game since the beginning knows what I am talking about. Back when Kunark came out and wolf form was nurfed to make us kill on sight with most NPC's. Yet many classes now can use different illusions indoor and outdoor without lowering their faction. I believe that wolf form should be fixed to not give a negative faction it. If this means making it so we are kill on sight in zones like Unrest then so be it. But when NPC's attack just because your in wolf form that makes our group form all but useless in most cases despite adding to everyone's attack score. If the faction hit is to stay then I would say give us an indoor group wolf form, without the spirit of the wolf component, that would add to the attack of the party. Most indoor places everyone is kill on sight anyway so the faction hits would not be unwelcome as they are outdoors.<br>
<br>
I do realize that many will see this and disagree. It is not my intent to please anyone with my post. I simply am stating my views on what it will take to balance out the Druid class as the game is today. Sure everything listed in the petition would be nice to have. So would double attack and the Warrior's hit points. But let us not overlook the fact that many other classes need to fit in just as we do. We don't need to be specialized anywhere to be useful in a group. Groups just need to realize what we can do, the rolls we can fill, and to give many Druids the simple chance to learn how to fill these rolls in a group setting. Many Druids solo because they are forced to. While you may see Druids as a welcome addition many still see them as a waste of space and a burden that should be removed from the game. Everyone makes mistakes in a group when they first get into one. Even people who have been playing their class in a group for years will make them. Maybe instead of complaining that Druids have no idea on how to work with a group, the groups should help the Druids understand what they can do and how useful they can be to a group.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;I'm sorry, are you asking to form a Nature's Touch rotation on raids? No? Then wtf is your main problem in comprehending this issue? Is your group dying to AE? Then why don't you tell them to get the @#%$ out of the goddamned AE, or get better resist gear, or get off your raid. Please, list all encounters where the AE can not be mitigated by resists, or geometry, or intelligence.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
NT Rotation? Novel idea. Oh btw, more than one guild has used Chloroblast rotations for various purposes.<br>
<br>
As for AE's you can't avoid..I can think of a few offhand.<br>
<br>
Sont.  Kland.  Virtually every rooted dragon in NToV now. Arch Lich (for many classes).  Creator. Grieg. <br>
<br>
Just to name a few.  <br>
<br>
Resists? All but useless. The primary resist is simply level.  On raids with AEing mobs my resists are generally between 250-300 with AE Bard resists.  I still get hit for plenty.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;See, I keep hearing that this board is supposed to be flame free, but yet i see more &quot;stop being a moron&quot; posts from the regulars here than anyone else. Explain to me what is causing your group to take so much damage in ToV. Are they too low to resist the AE? Is their gear insufficient? Are they morons and standing out in the open? Explain it to me, because contrary to your belief, it is NOT SELF EXPLANATORY.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Only a handful of people in my guild are below level 60.  We have fairly good gear (Though we'd only killed Vulak once before they screwed us..Karana is a slow server sue us).  <br>
<br>
Um...Mr. Sharpest Tool in the Shed, most NToV Dragons are rooted now.  Usually in the middle of a large open lair.  Hiding is not always possible. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Wow, you suck at drawing analogies. I'm comparing YOUR HEAL to SHAMAN HEAL. Shamans do not get a direct heal. They get a heal over time. You get a direct heal, therefore you should not get a heal over time. Can you comprehend that, or is that still too vague for your simple mind?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok..lets try one for your simple mind.  Healing is all about ratio.  Timing is easily learned.  Shamans, btw, do get a direct heal.  Its called Chloroblast.  Its just like our chloroblast.  It has the exact same ratio as our Nature's Touch.  So, basically, they get the same direct healing we do and a HoT.<br>
<br>
If you think HoT's aren't worth as much as Direct Heals...explain why most clerics consider it a failure if they have to use any spells other than Celestial Elixer or Complete Heal?  They describe DL and Remedy as &quot;Oh hell, I screwed up&quot; spells.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I see this is a main stumbling block for all people that can't see this. I shall attempt to explain this another way. Clerics are the healers of the game. They are all powerful. They alone have the most powerful spell in the game...complete heal. No other class shall get this spell. After that, their 2 main heals are Elixir, and Divine Light...both of which are BETTER than the counterparts of the other priest classes...which are Torpor and Natures Touch. This is the way it should be. Clerics should ALWAYS be better healers than druids, and shamans for that matter. By increasing Natures Touch, you in essence, become a BETTER HEALER THAN A CLERIC in situations where CH is not necessary...&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
What you don't seem to understand is..at 400 mana with characters have 3000-8000 HP depending on the situation...CH is the primary heal clerics use.  Why the hell would they want to use Divine Light at 350 mana to heal less than 1k of damage when they can heal 10k of damage for 400 mana?  If they need to keep the tank up long enough to cast CH, they usually toss on CE.  The situations where clerics use Remedy and Divine Light...are slim, basically &quot;oh @#%$&quot; situations.  With CH, clerics will ALWAYS be the best healer. End of story.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;So, if it can't be snared, a druid usually wouldn't be soloing it right? And if you're in a group, having it snared isn't as big of a deal, right? So, again, where is the problem here? Please, ask your local necromancer how he feels about his epic. Any epic enabled necro loves it to death...he doesn't whine about the 1 mob in each zone that can't be snared, he avoids the mob. Take a hint. You're not supposed to be 100% effective against all mobs in the game. How does a necro feel against trakanon? &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Actually, bright one, Necro's have complained about the very same problem with their epic.  Our epic effect is a useless effect for us unless we are soloing.  You bitch because we can solo, then you bitch when we suggest we want some spells that will be of better benefit while raiding or grouped.  Why don't you just say &quot;I hate druids because I got KS'd by one 2 years ago at level 10&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> o you get a cold based Debuff at level 24 too? Then why should you get one at 60? I'm lost. You want a rain at 60? I guess that's what you're saying.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Druids have cold and fire based direct damage spells.  They gave us a nice fire debuff to help our fire based spells to land on high resist mobs.  Unfortunately Verant seems to enjoy making zones with mobs who are fire immune.  That leaves us with Cold based damage.  Guess what? They still have those nice high resists to cold to frequently and druid nukes are pretty easily resisted to begin with.  End result? We can't nuke the mobs for jack.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You have asked to be better than everyone. You have asked to be a better healer, which I demonstrated above&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
You didn't demonstrate much of anything, considering your arguments are flawed.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and you want ports in luclin, which wizards don't even have&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Newsflash buddy, wizards have both an evac to Nexus and a TL to Nexus.  Neither class can port to Luclin from Norrath, but that isn't what we asked for, at least not at the exclusion of Wizards.  Personally I think both classes should be able to port to Luclin from Norrath.  Further Newsflash.  For the first half of the game Druids were considered to be the Masters of Teleportation and it was accepted.  We gave that one up to keep the wizards happy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;A jack of all trades is one who can do all things ADEQUATELY and, i'm sorry if you yourself can not, but I know many druids that can, and do, on a daily basis.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I don't think you do.  Because we can't.  Not at the level of the game this petition is focused on.  We are not talking about raiding HoT or West Wing.  Hell's bells I can heal the MT by myself in those places on the yard trash.  We are not talking about killing Statue.  We are not talking about Xp groups.  We are talking about NToV and High end Luclin mobs. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;That shaman is chaining chloroblasts on your tank fighting the mob quadding for 600's. Druids are contributing far more healing power than shamans are on raids because they are doing it FASTER.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
One more time, say it with me.  NT and Chloroblast are for all intents and purposes the same damned spell.  If you need to chain heal..you don't use Nature's Touch, it takes too long.  You use Chloroblast.  Same mana ratio.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Torpor doesn't save casters&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Its saved my ass many times.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;My warrior has died before because my shaman couldn't keep up with damage output with just chloroblast. Druid could have with Natures Touch&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
No the Druid could not have.  Why? Its the same damned mana ratio and chloroblast casts faster...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;On a side note, lets take all Nature's Touch's out of druids spellbooks and place them only on guardian wurms in veeshan's peak.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
On second note, lets take Regrowth of Khawhateveritscalled out of Shaman spellbooks and place them as super rare drops off Juggs.  Sorry this arguement is bunk.  BTW, there isn't a level 60 shaman in my guild who doesn't have Malo and Torpor.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;See how many of them are still using Chloroblast because their heal wasn't a vendor spell at 60&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I use chloroblast at 60 as much if not more often than Nature's Touch anyways.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I wonder how many druids would be willing to give up their invis, their ports, their SoW, their damage shields, just to heal like a cleric&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I wonder how many clerics would be willing to give up Complete Heal and Rez's just to have invis, ports, SoW and Dam Shields...oh wait, clerics have dam shields now.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;This game isn't always about min/maxing. If you're not getting picked for pickup groups, chances are, you're a dumbass. If you know how to play your class, people will ask you to come group with them.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
How often do you get invited to pick up groups Mr. Necro?<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;My main hunting group is a 60 warrior, 60 shaman 60 druid 56 monk. Up until today, the shaman was 59...which meant no torpor. The druid healed just fine, on his own (oddly enough, if you believe half the bullshit spouted in that petition,) everywhere...we did seb crypt with a 51 rogue instead of the monk...and never had any issues. We've done top of skyshrine, we can do xp areas of kael, we can do Akheva. Yah, my warrior has 4500hp buffed, but the damage output in XP groups is not sufficient to warrant a better heal, and when the damage output is sufficient, a cleric is required...also negating the need for a better druid heal.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yes a druid can heal fine in an XP group in most places..so long as there is a slower in the group.<br>
<br>
On the otherhand, Seb is a joke.  XP areas in Kael are Tormax area and Arena for me.  I solo in Akheva on those occasions I feel like it.  <br>

Well, we don't want to heal tanks anyway, we want to heal our group, and we can't heal AE damage -- you shouldn't be taking it.<br>
<br>
We can't keep up with unslowed mobs -- well then slow them<br>
<br>
We can't slow ubermobs --- uber mobs shouldn't BE FUCKIN HITTING YOU SHOULD THEY?  THEY SHOULD BE HITTING THE TANKS.  TANKS WHO YOU SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAL.<br>
<br>
Jesus christ, stop running in circles.  This entire thread illustrates very graphically how there is absolutely nothing wrong with druids.  If there was something wrong, EVERYONE WOULD KNOW IT AND AGREE ON IT.<br>
<br>
We know what's wrong with necros...DOT's don't stack with other necros.  All necros know it, all necros agree on it -- VI is looking into it.<br>
<br>
Because you say VI is looking into &quot;caster balance&quot; does not mean that your petition makes druids balanced.  It in no way balances druids, it makes them overpowered compared to all other classes, by making them better than many different classes.<br>
<br>
The biggest issue with caster balance is that melee's stack on raids.  You can have 5 or 100 melees and they are all helpful.  1 Necro is useful, 1 shaman is useful, 1 enchanter is useful.  Add more of each class and you diminish the usefulness of each individual character.  Your petition adresses this in no way, shape or form.  Your petition would mostly impact the AAXP grind at 60, by making you have more powerful DOT's (which don't stack on raids) and better heals (of which you shouldn't be doing more than spot healing and helping out the CH rotation on raids)...thus making your petition total bunk.<br>
<br>
Of course, there's no convincing you of that fact.  If you think your toon is useless, you probably are useless. No amount of coercing from me will help that i'm afraid.<br>

<br>
And I agree.  But there's a difference between performing better and being necessary.  We didn't ask for a CH in the petition.  Until that happens, I don't see raids &quot;depend on&quot; druids.  With the petition, it merely increases our usefulness on raids, which is what we seek.  How is that asking for too much?  You provided you own justification on why druids will never take over clerics as the best healers.  <br>
<br>
If the cleric community feels that having their high desirability dropping at 60 is a serious issue, then perhaps you should draft up your own requests for balance.  Why instead prohibit another class from doing better?  (If you think we're so great already, read my original post)  Are you asking us to include in our petition &quot;oh btw, along with our healing upgrades, we petition to see that shaman and cleric healing abilities be enchanced as well.&quot;?  Be realistic.  Any change made to druids will not be a lopesided affair. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

<br>
We're talking about the high end game here.  For the vast majority of the people playing it XP isn't an issue anymore except AAxp.  <br>
<br>
Even if it were....Clerics have always and will always get in groups before a druid.  Can you do a group without a cleric? Yeah.  Do people want to? No.  They look for a tank a cleric and a mana regenner first and formost.  Then they fill in the rest.<br>
<br>
Clerics will always be wanted for groups.  With CH their healing will always be unrivaled.   <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

<br>
So basically what you are saying is you &quot;Worked&quot; for 15+ Days so that you can have fun in a game(Raid)?  The moment EXP feels like work, you should probably stop doing it.   As for how are Druids balanced raid wise.  You have the ability to fill holes in a Raid.<br>
<br>
Low on healers?<br>
Low on Wizards?<br>
Low on Damage Dealers?<br>
Low on Snarers?<br>
<br>
No Class can fill as many holes as a druid can.  If your raid has a sufficient number of people to fill those classes, then your role will be minimized.  Just like the 6th warriors role is minimized.  <br>
