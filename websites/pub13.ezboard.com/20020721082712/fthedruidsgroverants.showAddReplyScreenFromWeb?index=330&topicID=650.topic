If you can't see how spells used during raids are linked with spells used during xp groups, then there is really nothing we can do for you.  You are simply ignoring part of the balancing act that is EQ. <p><center><a href="http://www.immortalsrising.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.immortalsrising.com/sigs/crystalssig.jpg" border="0"></a><BR>

Shaman out solos a Druid<br>
Shaman more important to a Group (with or wo/ cleric)<br>

Monk outsolos a Druid<br>
Monk more important to a group (that has a cleric)<br>

Necro could be more valuable to a Group if they used the right spells.<br>

<br>
Yes, but what you want extends past raiding.  Also, many, many, many (druid) people are talking about how the improvements will help in higher level group, non-raid play.  I am addressing that.  I read all 74 pages of the petition, and I am adding my opinion here, as the moderators asked, instead of on that thread.<br>
<br>
Would you like it if I just simply said, as many others have: you are asking too much?  I am responding to the people who've said:<br>
<br>
&quot;It's sad to see a wizard chosen over a druid for their nuking ability&quot; <br>
<br>
(why, when this is what wizards are supposed to do best?)<br>
<br>
&quot;People would rather have a cleric than a druid in their group&quot;<br>
<br>
(well, yes, healing is what clerics do best...if I get the choice, and we need a healer, and have only one spot, yes, I want the cleric.)<br>
<br>
... etc.<br>
<br>
But then again, the only druid I've seen turned down for a group is the one who let her whole group die twice while she was on the phone with her boyfriend... not a fault of the class, but the player.<br>
<br>
Druids *are* jacks of all trades.  You have amazing abilities, and so many different ways to play your class.  You're great soloers, but you can also find groups - more-so than necros and mages.  MOST classes on upper level raids have the problem of &quot;we only need one or two of them&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Part of the reason you have gotten so many responses and /agrees on your petition is because it has been spotlighted on sites like Casters Realm.  I would be curious to see how many you would have gotten otherwise?<br>

Druids do have a role on raids. <br>
It is just not as defined as everyone elses role.<br>
Also there are way too many of us so we feel gimped once a druids show up.<br>
Mages, necro and  shaman i think are the only classes that really can say the same. The big difference is ther are far fewer people playing those classes in teh endgame. <br>
I think the group heal would be nice but it infinges on other classes. I think a better ratio heal can be worked in somewhere. I think the dot is overpowering. I think the POTG is the idea that makes the most sense.<br>

I think they should nerf mages and bards damage shields and just make ours all powerfull!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I've seen the druids claim that necros and shamans have the best mana regen out of any caster.  This is true, but look at what it costs us.  At level 8 we get the first of our mana regen spells and it has a conversion rate of 2 to 1.  This means that for every 2 hit points I burn I get 1 mana point back.  Not very efficient and faced with the fact that necros don't have many hit points we can easily kill ourselves.  At level 60 with the Ancient Spell: Master of Death for every 63 hit points we gain back 44 mana. The conversion on that is 1.4 to 1, which is better than 2 to 1.  Sure we have mana regen out the wazoo *sarcasm*, but if walk away from my system for than a few seconds I die from regenerating my mana.  This is called BALANCE.  Sure I get mana back all the while sacrificing my hit points to do it.  Oh don't forget that the instant a necro casts two life tap type of spells in a row we are suddenly put at the top of the hate list and we get aggro.  Everything that the tank isn't attacking right at that moment descends upon the necro and when your running at 20-40% health your dead very fast.  Isn't my mana regen wonderful? *sarcasm*  <br>
  <br>
I wish that my necro could have at least some of the abilities that druids have, but I also understand that necros have serious downsides.  My necro is a dark elf.  Gee I double screwed because I'm a necro and a dark elf.  I'm KoS to everything that isn't evil aligned.  I still can't buy and sell to the vendors in EC or WC.  Gee I wish my necro was well loved like the druids are who can go pretty much everywhere without being killed on sight.  Oh because I have faction with Freeport now doesn't mean I can just stroll through without any worries.  I have to worry about npc mages, wizzies, and chanters attacking me because I'm a follower of Innoruuk, a dark elf, and a necromancer.  I avoid the NPC mages like the plague and pretty much any good aligned NPC for that matter.  Druids have it sooo rough.  Play a necro to level 60 and see how easy druids have it.<br>
I checked the class server statistics last night on Guildmagic and I found some really interesting numbers.  On Lanys there are 5397 registered characters on Guildmagic and they provide the break down of how many of each class are played.  So here is this shocking revelation.<br>
Bards: 252<br>
Beastlords: 71<br>
Clerics: 505<br>
Druids: 727<br>
Enchancters: 387<br>
Magicians: 235<br>
Monks: 367<br>
Necromancers: 297<br>
Paladins: 299<br>
Rangers: 390<br>
Rogues: 283<br>
Shadow Knights: 259<br>
Shamans: 337<br>
Warriors: 691<br>
Wizard: 297<br>
<br>
As you can see there are in many cases 2 to 2.5 times more druids than any other class, excluding warriors.  Cry me a river and I might feel sorry for you.  Druids I wouldn't have to worry about losing any slots to the shamans because on my server you outnumber them 2 to 1.  In fact I wouldn't worry about losing your slots on raids either because you outnumber all the classes that specialize in the areas that your generalized in.  Show me some numbers backed up by Guild Magic on how your suffering for raids slots and I may feel sorry for you.  Quit asking for more power when you clearly dominate the game and let the other classes that are suffering to come into the limelight.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> This is not a direct comment regarding the petition, but just a few comments regarding posts made by a few people.<br>
<br>
I have read through almost all the posts here.  The most common comment is &quot;Druids are overpowered&quot; and then that is followed by a listing of our spellbook.  Then some would even throw in the good old &quot;well you have so much... you can solo already, and now you want to be good on raids&quot;.<br>
<br>
Let me give you some insight into the life as a druid.  For everyone who thinks soloing is so good, I hope you know already that I cannot solo in ToV to get my SS armor.  I cannot solo Faydedar to get my epic.  I cannot solo my way into VP or ST.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        In summary, I cannot solo any portion of the high end game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Otherwise the whole argument about a choice between solo vs. grouping classes may have a point.  It is also misinformed to assume that the druid is the best soloing class.  Ask a Necro how many mobs he can take down when the druid is sitting his ass down for 10 mins medding to full.  Ask the Wizard who can out quad me anyday with their superior nukes.  Ask a Shaman which dragon he took down when druids are kiting little wyverns in CS.  And before people start about soloing = best experience, I'll tell you that my friend did 3 yellows of 59 in 2 days of AE action in Sebilis (last I remember druids don't typically get invited into this kinda thing).  That's not even mentioning that quadding = @#%$ loot.<br>
<br>
On top of that, I can also tell you about the frustrutation I get sitting there at zone line LFG.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        If I was so overpowered, I would get 15 tells on my first ooc.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You can go through our spellbook and name all the spells you want, but in a group, the only reason we get invites is either:<br>
<br>
1) There's no cleric around<br>
2) The group needs an evaccer<br>
<br>
This has been the case since level 50.  Don't even start about druids main healing a group with Sup Heal and Chloro.  Been there, couldn't do it.  How can clerics simultaneously claim that they are now potentially left behind for AAXP grind groups and that druids have it easy from 1- 50 when they are THE most needed class for groups from 50-59 (if not earlier - and yes clerics can solo just as well as druids in the early levels).  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        I think it proves the point if I mention that as a group leader, the first class I look for is a cleric.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Having a cleric is the single biggest enchancement to my group IMHO, and I really wouldn't go into a dungeon without one.<br>
<br>
And raids.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        I would argue that this is probably THE goal of the game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I don't level to 60 because I enjoy sitting out in the middle of nowhere in TD and quad raptors.  I leveled to 60 to gain abilities which allow me to contribute to a raid in visiting uber zones, taking down uber mobs, and getting uber gear.  And for druids this has been an enormous disappointment (as are other classes such as Mages and Necros).  The druid's most important function today on a raid is porting everyone there and porting everyone out.  I don't think druids expected to be a raid bus when they chose the class.  As priests we try to be secondary healers.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>        How would druids, with our proposed healing upgrades, infringe on clerics' role as the &quot;best healer&quot; when clerics have the *exclusive* right to healing the most important person on a raid - the MT?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  As someone already pointed out, druids being secondary healers take care of &quot;everybody else&quot;.  Ever try healing a group when everyone's HP bar go down 1 bub every tick?  If we are doing our jobs just fine with our heals today, why do you think we bother to go through all this trouble and ask for an upgrade?  I certainly expect VI to rebalance any implications these changes have on a cleric's role in XP group.<br>
<br>
I think it is unfair to argue that since an upgrade to druids may step on other classes' toes, then we should get nothing at all.  Look at the Shaman, another priest.  They solo just as well as druids, yet they play a very significant role on raids.  Would you attempt a boss mob with no Shaman slow and Focus?  Would you attempt that same boss mob with no DS and PotG (druid's counterpart buffs)?  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      Balance is about having DIFFERENT classes with DIFFERENT abilities but an EQUAL opportunity via EQUAL contribution.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You cannot say that druids are balanced (or oh god overpowered) judging from how well we solo or the number of spells we get.  Soloing does not give us equal opportunity, and our list of spells does not give us equal contribution.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    This post is NOT intended for whining about what druids can't do and subsequently descending into class envy.  This post is however intended to correct anyone who thinks the druid is a godly class.  I'm speaking from experience.

Then maybe they should stop acting like it...  I'm embarrased to have a druid...<br>

<br>
So far Vaaxx - I agree with you 110% ...    I do think Druids need a bit of 'help' in the healing department....  But, I don't think they need to be made into Gods like this petition is trying to make them...<br>
<br>
I'd love to see druids get an upgraded 'share wolf form', maybe even an 'inside sow'...  I'd love for better heals (maybe not better - maybe faster - less taunt/mana for chain healing....<br>
<br>
But Verant is going to look at this petition, and laugh it right out the door...<br>

Will we get the upgrades we want?  dont know,  but I am sure we will get the upgrades we need.  If that means epic stays the same,  oh well.  If that means clerics get a better heal to compensate for a new druid and shaman heal,  then great!<br>
If that means we get a new job on raids, thats good too. <br>

Tons of happy druids ? That's why a bunch of high level druids got together and made that petition right ?<br>
<br>
And yes the warrior epic example is COMPLETELY irrelevant. Warriors do get lots of ubber weaps much better than their epic. Someone so used to the high end game should know that. Unless he wants to just throw arguments in the air for the sake of doing it. Like you ?<br>

&gt;How would druids, with our proposed healing upgrades, infringe on clerics' role as the &quot;best healer&quot; when clerics have the *exclusive* right to healing the most important person on a raid - the MT? <br>
Justification<br>
<br>
&gt;I think it proves the point if I mention that as a group leader, the first class I look for is a cleric.<br>
Yup your right that proves everything.  /Sarcasm off<br>
<br>
&gt;You cannot say that druids are balanced (or oh god overpowered) judging from how well we solo or the number of spells we get. <br>
There are 2 parts of Balance.   There is Raid Balance and EXP Balance.  I personally think you are Overpowered EXP wise and pretty well balanced Raid wise.  <br>
<br>
&gt;Surely if I was so overpowered, I would get 15 tells on my first ooc.<br>
Depends.  Are there 3000 Druids on or 3?  <br>
<br>
&gt;Balance is about having DIFFERENT classes with DIFFERENT abilities but an EQUAL opportunity via EQUAL contribution.<br>

Do you only find groups when there's no 60 druid around?  And what's your definition of &quot;a very easy class&quot;?  Does a level 30 cleric sit LFG all day?  I'd take a cleric over a druid to main heal any day when I play my chanter.<br>

No Cleric no raid.  Is that enough justification?  Or do you want justification on why MT is the most important person?  Next time have a SK be the MT on a boss mob.  Or do you want justification on why druids can't heal the MT?  I think as someone with CH, you understand that better than I do.<br>

Read my post again.  People exp to get to raids.  Do you see people say oh I just dinged 60 I think I've just finished the game.  And please enlighten me with some justification for how druids are balanced raid wise.  Maybe you know something I don't know yet after 60 levels playing a druid.<br>

I don't want to be more like clerics.  I want to be more like a priest.  What are you implying, that clerics should be the only healer in game and druids can't request upgrades to be better secondary healers?  It's like saying any hybrid class should never ask to do more damage or they'll become more like rogues, or any caster class shouldn't ask for a nuke upgrade or they'll become more like wizzies.  BTW you know you can outnuke me with Judgement at level 56 right?  Would you say that's &quot;too druid&quot; for you?<br>

<br>
No. It isn't.<br>
<br>
You want to be an "essential" class on a raid, go play a Cleric or something.<br>
<br>
You don't, go play one of the hordes of other classes that are not "essential" on a raid. Druid's aren't the only ones that get left out in the cold.<br>
<br>
Of course, then Verant makes *every* class absolutely 100% positively necessary on raids, and then no one raids. Our guild is not the smallest guild in the world, but I don't know if we could field a Druid, Necro, Shadowknight, Monk, Cleric, Beastlord, Chanter, Mage, Bard, Warrior, Monk, Paladin, Shaman, Rogue, Ranger and Wizard all at the same time. Certainly not without advance warning that the raid is gonna happen.<br>
<br>
So no more 'Oh look, mob X is up, let's grab 20 people and smack it"<br>
<br>
Druids are never going to be one of the many classes that raids depend on. Deal with it.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's not right, but I can't find a solution to that problem without creating others.<br>
<br>
Can you? <p>--<br>

As to easy to play maybe /shrug I have over 100 days /played on my 54 druid and only 45 (?) days /played on my 53 cleric maybe someday they will catch up with each other I donno, if I continue to be requested to play a cleric on a raid then I'm sure the cleric will catch up.  <br>

As for clerics and groups at level 30 /laugh the only advantage a druid has getting groups then is the ability to port to another zone when its obvious every group has a &quot;healer&quot;.  Until lvl 39 and superior healing is given to Clerics the differences in the healing classes are not very apparent to non healers.  At lvl 39 is when no one /ooc looking for healer they start /ooc looking for cleric and continue that trend to level 60. <p><CENTER>
