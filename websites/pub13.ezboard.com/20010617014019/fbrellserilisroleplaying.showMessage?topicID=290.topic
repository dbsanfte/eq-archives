<br>
<br>
She heard the thundering of running feet and screams of terror before she saw anything.  Coming up over the lip of the hill, she looked down into the vast valley spread before her.  The Overthere.  She’d been here before, but only to kill one of the chickens she’d heard so much about.  A tough fight, those were!  But good with a little elven wine marinade, slowly simmered.<br>
<br>
This trip, she was just here to have a bit of a rest.  She’d spent far too much time lately in the ice storms and bitter cold of Velious.  She was looking for sunshine.  Maybe get a tan….play some shuffleboard.  Damdor was off helping to organize the new guild he’d recently joined, so she was on her own.<br>
<br>
She’d gotten off the boat at Firiona, and hung around town a bit, talking to old friends.  She had a relative, at one of the shops, but the girl was such a snob, she would rarely speak with her.   High elves!   (A relative through marriage….Melba’s Grandmother – a bard – had married another bard who had been previously married [you know how bards are…]….to a high elf….so, this girl was….Melba’s 3rd step-cousin, once removed?  Or something….)<br>
<br>
Melba’s previous guild had made its headquarters in the Firiona Vie Outpost.  It was a second home to her.  “First home, now” she thought, as she remembered that Qeynos had recently been taken over by evil forces.  She was glad her parents were visiting her brother in Erudin, at the time, and had avoided the unpleasantries.  Although she was sure her father was sorry he missed it.  He loved a good fight.<br>
<br>
As was her wont, Melba camped under the bridge.  Sometimes she thought she had troll blood in her.  She loved to be alone, listening to the seagulls, the gentle lap of the waves echoing under the bridge, and none of those damn trackers casting all night.  And the Pilgrims!  Tromp tromp tromp, day and night, never resting, ceaseless in their pilgrimages.  Firiona was a busy place.<br>
<br>
Her first night back in town Melba had bought some food, built a little fire under her usual bridge, and lay back on the warm sand.  An owl hooted in the distance as the last of the setting sun disappeared with a pinkish orange glow behind the hills.  She could hear the delicate fluttering of drixie wings, and the occasional pained howl of a drolvarg as it was attacked by a roving gang of Pilgrims. Would those dogs never learn??  Melba smiled and crossed her arms behind her head.  She drifted off to sleep thinking how good it was to be home.<br>
<br>
The next day dawned crisp and clear.  The boat was in, with a fresh bunch of passengers from Butcher Block.  They were busy looking for binds at the bank, asking for SoW’s to get them past the Drachnids (“Ahh, the Drachnids!  How I’ve missed them!” Melba thought).  Some who’d had enough of the place were seeking a mystic portal “To anyplace!  Just get me out of here!”.  They’d be singing a different tune, if they went to Velious, Melba thought.  She shivered and remembered to be glad of the warm sun on her face.<br>
<br>
Standing outside the bank after she’d changed some money, she peered up at the giant statue of Firiona Vie.   She shook her head and smiled ruefully.   She remembered back to those days a few months ago, when she was trapped in the cavern in the Eastern Wastes….where she’d met an injured young girl named Firiona.   Could that really have all happened?  Had Tunare really appeared before her?  Had they really saved Veeshan, and thus the Thurgadin Dwarves, from certain death?  It all seemed like a made up fiction, now….<br>
<br>
Melba turned and headed for the main bridge out of town.  Her plan was to cross to the stream, head through the Lake of Ill Omen area, to the Frontier Mountains, and then on to the Overthere.  She’d heard the sun was warmest, in that region.  She ached in her bones for a bit of warmth….<br>
<br>
The drixies flitted by her, and the pilgrims tromped on, as she crested the hill that lead to the stream.  No one seemed interested in the spiders.  And it was no wonder….she’d heard stories of a high level Necromancer who liked to waylay travelers along the stream.  “Get a job” she thought to the Necro, shaking her head, “Attacking people just for crossing a stream….”.  She proceeded cautiously, anyway. <br>
<br>
She reached the Lake zone, easily enough.  She’d hope so! after all the time she’d spent here.  Wading up through the creek, she was surprised to feel a small nipping at her heels.  Water dogs??  Her imagination astonished her sometimes.   She sloshed to shore, but the nipping continued.  “Sturgeon!  Get outta here!” she cried out, to no one in particular.  “Since when??”  she laughed and whacked the sturgeon’s head off.  She carefully packed it in her pack, for later barbequeing.  She hoped she had some lemon and an onion with her….<br>
<br>
Heading across the hill, she stopped to gaze fondly over the Lake.  Much the same as it was, last time she was here.  “Happy Times” she thought, as she was whacked from behind by an Iksar Pariah.  “Do you creatures never learn?” she asked it before dispatching it with three blows of her axe.  She felt sorry for them, and their lemming-like, pariatic need to attack anything that came near them.  Like crazy little rabid sturgeon, really.    She laughed and left the body on the gentle sloping hillside, to rot in the sun.<br>
<br>
Continuing on, and around the hill, she came to the Iksar fortress.  Memories flashed back to her, more strongly than ever.  She and Damdor and Ainasa and Keera and Banlaen and others of her close friends had all “grown up” here.  She missed them all terribly.  A sigh caught in her throat.  Why can’t we stay young forever?<br>
<br>
Turning her back on her melancholy, Melba trudged on.  She came to the Frontier Mountains zone and paused.  More memories, through here.  Stronger ones, probably.  Well, it couldn’t be helped.  The sun wasn’t at all warm enough, by the Lake.  Certainly not in the Mountains….<br>
<br>
The first thing she heard when she crossed over was a barking.  Burnai!!  Yip yip yip!  And then silence.  Someone had defeated one of the little badgers.  Good!  That yipping…those beady little eyes…one less badger.  Good.  She couldn’t see who had done it, though.<br>
<br>
She headed off down the steep hill that lead to the gorgeous forest valley, with it’s glacial peaks and snarling forest giants.  A goblin ran past her, and doubled back towards her.  “Oh no you don’t…. you little green …..” she said, and caught it with a snare.  She cast Stinging Dog (or whatever it’s called, she could never remember) on it, and watched it die slowly.  She took its whip, tied the weapon around its dead neck, dragged it to a tree, and hung the goblin from a low branch.  Melba felt refreshed.<br>
<br>
Onward she trudged.   She’d passed the valley that lead to the Overthere three times before she found it.  Why did they have to hide it from her?  It was the trees, she thought.  They were against her.<br>
<br>
Almost to the zone, Melba paused.  There was a dull throbbing in her temple, and she thought she’d better rest a bit.  She started a fire, and gutted and cooked the sturgeon.  Night was falling, and she thought she’d better camp here, in the relative safety of this little valley.  Tomorrow, she’d head immediately for the warm, sunny plains.   She’d feel much better, then.<br>
<br>
Her sleep was plagued with nightmares.  She’d dreamt that most of her friends had died.  And those that lived still, hated her and thought her a traitor. They were chasing her, hunting for her, with one thought but to kill her!  She woke up in a cold sweat.  The fire had died down, and the wood snapped and crackled weakly, giving off almost no warmth.  She felt like that, inside.  Perhaps she was ill.  Perhaps the sturgeon had been off. <br>
<br>
The next morning, only vaguely refreshed, Melba headed up the side of the valley hill, and crossed over into the Overthere.  Ah!  The warm sun on her face felt so welcoming!!  But the screams…that wasn’t a good sign.  She sidled up the hill a bit further, and paused at the lip.  Here, she heard rather than saw the passing of many people….dust was kicked up, and fell slowly back to the ground.  Was it a stampede??  She lifted the visor of her helm and peered into the valley.  All was quiet now.  Around her, down the hill, on the ledge that looked like a common passageway, bodies were littered.  At least 10 of them.  What had done this??  Certainly not the chickens.<br>
<br>
She left the visor of her helm up…it was so hot here!! Glory!  And started down the hill.  One of the corpses rose up a bit, and moaned.   She ran to him.<br>
<br>
“What happened here?” she asked, kneeling beside the injured monk.<br>
<br>
“Dragoon….” he moaned.  The last word he ever spoke.<br>
<br>
Melba remembered the Dragoons.   Her encounters with them had all been brutal.  As a little girl, she’d been threatened by one.  Later, attacked by one.  Another time, her husband Damdor had ambushed and killed the one who had threatened her, as a little girl.  It had spat out at her “I should’ve killed you….” before it died.  She hadn’t understood pure, malevolent Hatred, back then.  She did, now.  <br>
<br>
Melba closed the monk’s eyes, and tried to say a quick prayer to his god.  Unsure of who his god was, she asked Tunare to watch over his passage to the next world.  Tunare didn’t seem to hear her, though, as one of the large chickens came over and started pecking at the back of her helm.  clang clang!  the noise reverberated in her head.<br>
<br>
“Shoo, damn bird!” she said, and waved her axe at it.  It cackled at her, and began to pick at the monk, instead.  Melba gaped.  “I can’t stop it,” Melba thought.  She watched for a bit, and then backed away.  She turned and headed down the path, no longer thinking where she was going.  Just walking.  What a horrible world Norrath could be.<br>
<br>
“Dragoon….” she thought to herself as she walked down the hill.  She stopped and peered around.  “I don’t see any Drago……” <br>
<br>
Thwap!<br>
<br>
“What the?”  she turned quickly, slapping her visor down.<br>
<br>
Thwap!<br>
<br>
“Who the blazes are you???” she asked the heavily armored gentleman currently trying to knock her block off.<br>
<br>
“Do not interfere with me, Melba,” it said to her.<br>
<br>
Thwap!  Clang!<br>
<br>
She tried to Root the thing, but to no avail.  “Don’t make me kill you!” she growled at it.<br>
<br>
It laughed at her and hit her again.  At this rate, she’d be dead soon.<br>
<br>
Clang!<br>
<br>
In sheer frustration, she ripped her helmet off her head and hurled it at him.  “Stop it!” she screamed.  <br>
<br>
He stopped mid-clank.<br>
<br>
“What?”  <br>
<br>
“I said, Stop it!  You can’t just go around whacking people for no damn reason!!  Why do you do it?  What sort of sick, stupid agenda do you Dragoons have, anyway?  Let me see it!  I want to see your job description!”  She was ranting.  She knew it.  She could hear herself.  But she couldn’t stop herself.<br>
<br>
“I…” he paused.  “What do you mean?  I don’t have it ON me, stupid woman.”  He swung his broadsword up into the air, ready for another blow.<br>
<br>
“I’ll wait!” she hollered.  She pointed at him.  “Who’s your god?”<br>
<br>
“Who do you think?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“How should I know.  Why should I care?  Does you god rule over you?  My god does NOT rule over me.  She guides me.  I respect her.  I praise her.  I pray to her.  But she does not RULE me.  I am not BLINDLY LEAD by what she says.  Are you?  Are you blinded by your god??  Because I can think of NO other reason for a man like you to go around mindlessly whacking people.  Especially with no warning.  How fair is that?  How sportsmanlike is that?  Is your god, then, utterly evil, contemptible, corrupt, and ignorant?”  She was going to lose her voice, at this rate.<br>
<br>
“Yes, most likely,” he said, darkly.  “But not ignorant.”<br>
<br>
“Prove it,” she said.<br>
<br>
The Dragoon stared at her.<br>

She herself felt that something had changed within her. Her eyes burned, her mind was in turmoil, and yet…she felt no fear.  Only…something else.  Frustration?   Sadness?  Anger?  Something.<br>
<br>
“Proof, you want,” the thing hissed at her.  “Ok, then, human.  I arrest you in the name of General V’Deers.  Please drop your weapon and prepare yourself for binding.”<br>
<br>
Melba’s axe fell from her hands, and dropped into the sand with a thud.  The Dragoon stepped forward, grabbed her shoulder, and whirled her around.  He wrapped a golden cord around her wrist.  “It’s not a rope….” Melba thought, turning her head over her shoulder to watch.   <br>
<br>
“Eyes forward, prisoner.”  The Dragoon held a gauntleted hand in front of her eyes, forcing her to turn her head to the front.  <br>
<br>
She heard the two ends of the binding clank together, and the binds tightened on her wrists.  A magical bind of some kind!  She felt a slight buzzing that, while not painful, was not comfortable.  Like the small shock one got from Wisps, if you touched them while they lived.<br>
<br>
“What about my helm?” she asked.  <br>
<br>
“We have no need of it.  The chickens will roost in it, now.”<br>
<br>
“Oh fine….” She said through gritted teeth.  “That was a gift, you know!”  He didn’t care.<br>
<br>
“You’ll take my axe with you?” she prodded.<br>
<br>
“Your weapon now belongs to the Indigo Brotherhood.  They will use it as they see fit.”<br>
<br>
Melba laughed.  “You should know, sir, that you cannot use it!  I thought they taught you about weapons at the Dragoon Academy….”<br>
<br>
“We will melt it down and use it as a weight when we drown a prisoner…..” he snarled, and pushed her between her shoulder blades.  “Walk.”<br>
<br>
They trudged on in silence.  <br>
<br>
About a mile into their hike, Melba decided it was time for some fun.  “What’s your name?”<br>
<br>
“The prisoner will remain silent.”<br>
<br>
She kept walking, but looked back at him.  “Who are you trying to impress?  There’s no one for miles! The chickens don’t care if you tell me your name.  Look!  Look…” she said pointing with her head “that cactus with the glowing yellow eyes?  He doesn’t care if you tell me your name.”  She tried to look into the Dragoons eyes, through the slit in his helmet.  Nothing but darkness.  She faced forward again.<br>
<br>
A mile later, he spoke.  “I am Dragoon Tvem of the Indigo Brotherhood, Servant of Innoruuk.”<br>
<br>
Melba smiled.  Melba – 1; Dragoon - 0.  <br>
<br>
<br>
They walked for another hour or so.  She’d never been to the Outpost in the Overthere, for obvious reasons.  She was almost pleased to be able to walk into it without having to sneak or camoflage herself, or anything.  She was a guest!  Well, of a sort.<br>
<br>
Tvem hadn’t said another word to her on their journey, and she began to feel that maybe he realized telling her his name gave Melba just a tiny bit of power over him.  Poor thing.  She wanted him to know that she meant him no harm, that she was just curious.  And still, getting that answer from him had given her a bit  of power, and she liked that.<br>
<br>
She was led to a tower just on the other side of town, and locked in a cell.  Tvem removed her bindings with, she thought, a gentler hand than when he had put them on.  Perhaps he was just tired. <br>
<br>
The truth was, he was confused.  He’d never actually spoken with a human woman that showed no fear at confronting him.  Or was she just stupid?  That could be it.  Maybe she was addled.  <br>
<br>
He was also impressed by the fact that she didn’t whine and complain on the long walk to the Outpost.  Most women whine, he knew.  Also, the binds hadn’t pained her, as they did most Followers of Light.  Or if they did, she didn’t say.   Perhaps, he mused, she could be made to turn to the ways of Innoruuk!   That would certainly be a notch on his belt, he thought.  He’d bring it up with the General at her trial.<br>
<br>
<br>
Melba had been on her knees for 10 minutes, now, and they were starting to ache.   Last night, the cell had been cold and damp, but at least there’d been some straw to sleep on, and an itchy but warmish blanket.  But here, in the Hall of Innoruuk (really just a stone shed attached to the jail, which was also a stone shed), on her knees, waiting for the judgment of the General, Melba felt discomfort.  <br>
<br>
The General had been talking at her, all this time, about how the Brotherhood would soon wage a full-scale war on the Followers of the Light (“mindless lemmings”, he called them), and how unless she repented her ways and saw fit to join the Dark ones as a slave, she was damned to eternal pain and torment.<br>
<br>
“Look,” Melba interrupted while the General was taking a breath.  “I know what you’re talking about.  I understand what you’re asking me.  There’s no need to go on for so long.  I’m not going to turn into a spy for you.  And I’m certainly not going to turn into some type of personal slave, if that’s what you’re thinking ….” She cast a glance over her shoulder at Tvem,.  “I only came here on holid….”<br>
<br>
“Silence!” the General barked.  She sighed.  “You will be persuaded.  Or you will die.”<br>
<br>
Melba grimaced.   “No, I’ve made my decision.  Kill me now.”  She bowed her head.<br>
<br>
The General was silent.<br>
<br>
“Well??” Melba asked, looking around her.  “Tvem, you were more than happy to kill me, out in the field. Why do you hesitate?”<br>
<br>
The General looked at his Dragoon.<br>
<br>
“She knows your name?”<br>
<br>
“I….Yes Sir.”<br>
<br>
The General nodded.  “Brilliant.”  <br>
<br>
Melba took a breath.  “May I speak?”<br>
<br>
The General, in a quiet voice, said “You’ve already sealed your fate, and TVems.  You can’t possibly do any more damage.  Speak, woman.”<br>
<br>
She took a deep breath.  “I don’t have an agenda.  I’m not here to playact this good/evil thing with you.  I’m here purely as a tourist.  I do my thing, you do your thing.  If your thing involves killing me, I understand!  It’s part of your whole….thing.  However, my thing involves wandering the lands, looking for some sunshine and relaxation in between bouts of furious killing, which I'm sure you can relate to.&quot;<br>
<br>
She struggled to her feet, and the General did not try to stop her.<br>
<br>
She continued.  &quot;The ONLY problem I have right now is that YOUR man, here, General, whacked the back of my head with NO provocation.  I was wearing a helmet.  There was NO WAY he could’ve known what was inside that helmet.  Am I not completely covered from head to foot?  Well, except for my helm, which T-Fal here left out on the plains to rot, thank you very much.  My question is, how did he know I was NOT a Tier D’al?  How?  Do I smell?”<br>
<br>
The General looked from Melba to his Dragoon and back.<br>
<br>
“Do you see?” Tvem asked. <br>
<br>
“She asks too many questions,” the General answered.<br>
<br>
“Yes Sir.”<br>
<br>
“I….”<br>
<br>
“Silence, prisoner”.<br>
<br>
“.....” Melba clammed up.<br>
<br>
The General walked to his desk and took out a piece of paper.  “The Law is pretty clear, when it comes to your offense, Dragoon.”<br>
<br>
“What?”  Melba looked from the General to Tvem.  “His offense??”<br>
<br>
“I told you my name,” Tvem muttered. “I broke a fundamental Dragoon Law.  I will be punished.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, that’s just silly,” Melba said to the room. <br>
<br>
“You are hereby sentenced to be bound together, in the desert, until the elements or such creatures as may find you have destroyed you utterly.”  The General sighed.  “I’m really very sorry Tvem.  But you know there are many who would take your place, here.  And telling this follower of the light your name was a grave mistake.  But it’s done.  And so are you.”<br>
<br>
Tvem looked silently ahead, still at attention.<br>
