Faint light from the moon and stars filtered through the leafy canopy above, though most of the light in the tree city was from torches and glowstones. A few people were walking around for various reasons at this hour. It was still quiet and lonely enough to find a private spot along the railing. I needed some time alone from the crowd. I could still hear the voices of friends from the building behind me, mostly they talked in subdued tones. I looked out over the railing to the trees around me, looked down to the ground below at a creek making it's lazy way through the forest, yet I didn't really see them. My eyes were turned inward, on my memories.<br>
<br>
My name is Thamin, and I remember the day I left my home in search of adventure. The world was a wide open and dangerous place, but I was ready to make my mark in it. I found many friends to carry me through the days. I am a forest ranger. Lightly armored, my home is the outdoors, and I fight to protect sacred lands. The friends with me on this night are of my nature. They are good people, and we have seen each other through many good times and bad. I care greatly for them, but this story is not for them. My thoughts tonight center around the one who we mourn. One of our good friends, and one of the best people I could have the pleasure of knowing, has left this world for another. It is on these memories that I walk through on this night.<br>
<br>
I remember joining an old friend of mine near an oasis, out in the eastern desert. I and a few others jogged over to find this spot he wanted to show us. It was a place where orcs traveled in small groups, and it turned out to be a good ambush site. During this time we were introduced to a wood elf friend of his, Willowbee. I remember having a lot of fun with this young lady, and before you knew it she had joined us for several more adventures.<br>
<br>
How could I describe wood elves? They are in turns serious, yet mischevious; fiercely independant minded, yet loyal to friends; but overall fun to be with. Willowbee was a mixture of all of these. In times where my other friends weren't available, I spent time learning new tricks from this young maiden. I never thought I could face down a hill giant until she showed me the trick. She would cast her spells on it, slowing down its movements, and slowly burning it. It lumbered after her, never catching her, when I would leap from hiding to hack at it's back. I was gone as soon as possible, leaving the slowed giant to try pursuing my friend again. Willowbee kept its attention, and between her spells and my sneak attacks, we brought the giants crashing down.<br>
<br>
We taught each other a lot. Truth be told, I think I learned more than I could teach. Months passed and I spent lots more of my time hunting with her. I never thought I could be so in tune with a hunting partner. We talked a lot, but when battle came I began to know her movements and change strategies even before I heard her shout to me. The days found us fighting pirates on a isle in the ocean, killing goblins in a dungeon together, chasing down more giants, and eventually getting so strong as to kill wurms in the newly discovered continent.<br>
<br>
We had other good and true friends that joined us, but even though I love all my friends, I felt I spent the most time with her. Loved hearing her approach, and the accent in which she talked. &quot;Allo!&quot;<br>
<br>
Like myself and many of my friends, she displayed a generous nature as well. We acquired a great many magical items or things of worth in our travels. Many times were weren't in it for the treasure, just the fun and adventure. When we found ourselves with an overabundance of items we couldn't use, I remember finding young warriors and adventurers and distributing the wealth. Many times this was a part of games we set up, minor quests for them to complete in order to get a really nice item. We found ourselves swarmed with beggars at times, but those that begged the most often found themselves turned away. When I think back I try to think of how much Willowbee gave up to her friends and other young people, and I can't calculate figures that high.<br>
<br>
You can begin to understand the emptiness in that part of my heart, when I learned of her passing from this world forever. Her friends have all gathered here to toast to her honor, and share remembrances of days past. We shall miss her company, but we will always treasure her time with us. I am better for having known her. It also makes me think of the others that are lost to this world. I fondly remember the ranger that insisted on wearing black armor for a time, saying how good he looked in it. I remember the couple that passed recently. The knight with slightly greying hair, and the maiden who's songs could stir a party to greater heights. I remember that dark elf rogue, and wonder how strange it is to have had a friend as such as a dark elf rogue! And the blonde barbarian warrior, and the one-eyed rogue, and the snobby Erudite wizard, and...and...and...<br>
<br>
Notice how I don't say anything about death, for I believe in more than one world. She and those others passed from this world, but one day so shall I as well. Somewhere out there in another world we may meet again. It may be a different name and face, but it will be the same soul. I look forward to when that day comes Willowbee, for the person I knew in this world is a rare enough treasure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Author's note: Willowbee retires from Everquest on April 21st. And she will be missed greatly. I expect my own days to draw to a close too before the year ends. This is much more than a game, it is friends and new faces, and I have had many good days here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usildaardm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SildaarDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/17/01 11:48:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Farewell Good Friend, I'll Miss You.</span><hr size=1> Well said my friend.

Willowbee is one such soul that will bring light and happiness to anyone who has the good fortune to spend time with her. She will be missed, and my heart aches at the thought of letting her go.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umelbatoast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melbatoast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/17/01 12:25:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://64.87.94.26/bowser/vales.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Farewell Good Friend, I'll Miss You.</span><hr size=1> A lovely tribute. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uemersum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emersum</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.flspot.com/loa/mb/loa_icon.gif WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=17 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/19/01 6:51:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Farewell Good Friend, I'll Miss You.</span><hr size=1> /cheer Thamin.<br>
