<br>
In other words, Zesty posts a plan for new raid rules.<br>
<br>
70 people vote on it. 55 vote yes.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that 55 people get to say what the guidelines are for a server with over 5000 accounts?<br>
<br>
So how many votes, total or for one side should it take to make an &quot;official&quot; change?<br>
<br>
Also, what percentage should it be to make an &quot;official&quot; change? Simple Majority (49/51%)? Vast Majority (2/3s or 3/4s)?<br>
<br>
I think before we continue on with any other planned &quot;official&quot; voting that these questions be answered. Otherwise you run the risk of losing your credibility (the Mods, this Board, this Website, etc...). <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

<br>
As for the comment about 55 ppl out of 70 voting setting policy for the whole server of 5000, that argument could be used against this whole board even if the voting turned out to be 500.  I mean how many voted in the last huge one?  I don't think it was anything near 500 - I could be wrong..still far from any type of majority of the server.  I think what we are shooting for is hoping that the guild leaders that frequent here will uphold the system in place.  If a few fall out, that is all she wrote for the present system. Having simple majority is a good way to probably edge towards the falling out part if enough people dissent the change.<br>

<br>
We also had over a 66% majority decision.<br>
<br>
I think these numbers represented a good percentage at the time of raid capable and active raiders (say 46th level and above).<br>
<br>
Bahd: I don't believe 1 vote or mere 50% percent majority would cut it. If an &quot;official&quot; rule were to be voted on and say 20 people won with 51% majority, I would laugh at the idea and certainly wouldn't uphold it if I didn't agree with it. Not to be arbitrary, but for the fact that few can not have a say over the many (not that few against that many).<br>
<br>
I think you all ought think about the mechanics of making this work over the &quot;great ideas&quot; we have to implement. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

How many people do you know in-game Kruunch?  Wouldn't you let them know there was a vote going on if you were concerned about the issue?  Wouldn't anyone else that's concerned about the issue do the same?  If you didn't and the vote didn't have much participation wouldn't it be your fault?<br>
<br>
If you want more people to vote get off your ass and publicize it.  The excuse &quot;I'm not gonna obey that rule cause not enough people voted or it was too close&quot; stinks.  If either happen it's nobody's fault but your own.<br>
<br>
Apparently there's not much interest in this subject either Kruunch, cause there's 81 views and only 5 responses.  Oh well, apathy strikes again.<br>

Just as you see a +/- margin of error in media based polls and surveys (because those are samples, too), we will have a margin for error here.  Therefore, it should be a good idea to increase the percentage needed to change an existing rule to offset the possible negative margin of error, 66% sounds good.  <br>
<br>
Even though some may think the higher level community is legislating the playing of several thousand people on the server, I think it would be safe to say the majority of the server (let's say under 40) do no play by our rules anyhow (they should play by Verant's), as they do not engage in anything this board attempts to regulate (planes, uber-bosses, dragons).  There's no sense trying to drag them all here to vote on stuff they will likely not see. <p><p><font face="Arial">Hawkline Monster<br>

I guess its a hard one, but still I would say that any post with over 150 unique voters could be used to make a rule for the whole server. <br>
<br>
And  i would say that 51% for or against should be enough to change a rule. No sense in waiting for 66% or even 75%.<br>
Lets say a rule pissed ppl off...would we really want to wait untill 75% of the voters are pissed off before changing it ? <br>

The topic should not be so contriversal that it only barely passes with a few votes or so.  Two thirds is a good number.  Also, even though it limits us, any future votes should be of the yes/no variety (this will require you to have faith in the moderators...something that is sorely lacking).<br>
<br>
On the whole legislation of all by the few (readers of this board).  Well you are on one side of the fence or the other.  Any amount of discussion on this is kinda pointless because the numbers probably won't ever change much, and their is no comprimise on the subject (the rules must apply to everyone).  So choose your side.  We know which one verant is on... and we know on which side the vast majority of plane raiders are on (for the moment at least).<br>

<br>
I've been going by simple majority of all votes cast....if you guys wanna do something different, discuss it and do whatever it is that needs to be done and we'll make it so.<br>
<br>
Frankly speaking, we have entirely too much legislation for a damn game already. <p><BR>

<br>
Just like elections in RL.  You don't vote, oh well.  The votes that are tallied are what matter.  Even if it is less than 25% of the population.  Lots of RL elections where done on less than that.<br>
<br>
I agree with Zesty, there is too much legislation here, it's a game after all.<br>

If we didn't use simple majority, we'd still have an Intentions board.<br>
<br>
If a simple majority can decide the president, I imagine it can decide what is the next mob to get moved off the Reservations boards.<br>
<br>
I think the discussion is moot anyway -  ever notice how this board gets as many views in a month as Rants gets in about 2 hours? Weird, eh? How many people who know about the Brell boards even care about how things are handled?<br>
