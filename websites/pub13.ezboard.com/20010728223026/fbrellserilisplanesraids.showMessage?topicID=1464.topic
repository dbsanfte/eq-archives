Some say that the whole plane is reserved and after a raid is complete, nobody may interfere with the plane until the next raid.  This preserved repops and give the next raid a shot at a full plane.<br>
<br>
But now, the boss mobs are very hard.  Some have said you need to be 57+ to participate AND know the strategy.  Level 57 is above the average level for our planes raiders.  Thus, Cazic (and maybe Inny) are going to remain dormant for weeks if nobody is permitted to intervene between raids to kill him.  Cazic and his cousin would be unharvested and wasted.<br>
<br>
But some people are concerned that what SR did will lead to FFA, a degradation of the server, or a lack of respect of the rules.  They argue that the rules work fine now and that in a few months, more raids will be able to kill the boss.  They don't want interventions, they want people to be patient, even if that leads to waste.<br>
<br>
Most of SR is in their end game.  They have done pretty much what they can accomplish.  The sleepers tomb is left, plane of mischief, and some other places are left as well.  Cazic was something they could do.  They find having to wait weeks to do what they can do (and nobody else can do) to be not only silly, or wasteful, but unfair.  Why get to the endgame if you can't play the endgame?<br>
<br>
The reservation system was set up when level 46-50 was the endgame.  Dragons and the planes.  Those rules have extended beyond kunark, and beyond the level 50 level cap.  They have not extended into Velious.  <br>
<br>
The question now is are those rules going to extend beyond the upgrade to the old world planes.<br>
<br>
I do not think that the rules created for a world where the level cap was fifty should apply anymore. Yes, keep the reservation system, but we must allow for intervention.  There is no reason why we can't balance the competing interests.<br>
<br>
Proposed rule:  The raiders next in line to an old world planar raid have a right of first refusal to kill the <br>
boss(es) of that plane.  It attaches at the start of the previous raid.  However, if that right is waived, the intervenors may attempt to kill the boss.  The right is non-assignable.<br>
<br>
It is a delicate and ephemeral right.  It attaches at the beginning of the previous raid.  Intent to preserve the right may be noticed in the post announcing the raid.  That will be suffcient to prevent a waiver.  <br>
<br>
To obtain a waiver, the subsequent raid leader, or one of his/her designated agents, must give it.  Designated agents must be posted in the post announcing the raid.<br>
<br>
Now there are some problems with this rule.  <br>
<br>
Q:  Some raiders a raid or two down may be able to kill the boss.  Is this fair to them?<br>
<br>
A:  They too could petition for an intervention.<br>
<br>
Q:  Some raiders may sell their wiaver to the highest bidder.  <br>
<br>
A:  Crass, yes, but so what?  But if it offends some, and it certainly might, then the rule could state that the waiver cannot be auctioned.<br>
<br>
Q:  What if people who have no realistic chance of taking out the boss refuse to waive?<br>
<br>
A:  There is always that chance.  Let them commit mass suicide.  You can petition the next group of raiders, and the next group, until you find someone reasonable.  Most of us are.<br>
<br>
I do not like adding rules or modifying them.  Prticularly useless rules.  Unnecessary prolix to a set of rules is an evil to be eshewed.  But the circumstances now require change.  This is the best solution I can think of to this problem.  I thank you all for the time you spent reading this post. <p>Chants Evensong

<br>
I would like to see to it that selling the waiver be frowned on, but how to implement a down side to this is the one question I have on it, or are we going to worry about that?<br>
<br>
So far the fact that it's frowned on has been enough I believe. <p><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" font color=#8A2BE2>Bristlebane's best to you all,<br>

<br>
Yes, our goal is to get into Sleeper's.  However, we have yet to be done with:<br>
<br>
Velketor (we've failed like 7 times)<br>
The Dain<br>
Yelinak<br>
85% of ToV<br>
Phara Dar (yes, we're nowhere near done with VP and it looks like we're the only ones still planning on going there)<br>
PoG (although, this zone sucks)<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
There's plenty of content left for us to keep busy with.  Although I'm perfectly at ease with our decision to kill CT, I doubt we'll see much arguing over him in the future.  Let's let the server play with him a bit to see what he's capable of, then we can start talking about waivers.  It's entirely possible that he'll be killed everytime he's up by whoever's raiding the zone.  It's also possible that no one will touch him, aside from two or three guilds.<br>

They have extremely stringent rules on taking non-guild on their raids.  Most of them have full planar gear.  So they clear Fear, lots of armor rots or they get backup pieces and then they kill the mini-bosses and CT.  That is unfair to those of us who are NOT &quot;done&quot; with the old planar stuff.  Personally I had no problems when they came in and put the smackdown on CT saturday.  As puller for the sunday raid I was better off without him around.<br>
<br>
So I guess what I'm saying is, if some of the higher level guilds, like SR, are only interested in the big mobs, why can't they at least bring some lower people...strangers (/gasp) to gain experience from them and some of the old planar armor?  I have signed up for more SR raids over the last year than I can remember and never been picked.  Skyre Draneth is the only large guild that has ever taken me (several times /thank Skyre).  <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

CT will be up a lot.  Until it's shown that other groups can take him out as well, CT should be considered separate from a regular Fear raid.  If you want to try &amp; kill him, sure. . .  But I don't think it's going to happen. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1467.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1459.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1464.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1464.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1464.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
