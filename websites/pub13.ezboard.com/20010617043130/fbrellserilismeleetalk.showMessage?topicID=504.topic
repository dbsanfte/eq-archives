We had healing power equivalent to druids and shamans, although usually not as much mana, we had buffs that were only one buff line less powerful than clerics, and we could dish out alot of damage, while still taking quite a bit. <br>
<br>
Paladins reigned supreme in places like Kithicor woods, Plane of Hate, and Lower Guk, where our Ghoulbanes dished out 162 damage each proc, and a 15dam 34delay sword was a very good sword to wield. Paladins were welcomed into groups with open arms, as they were very good at controlling aggro with thier stuns (and sometimes, undead nukes) and rooting, and thier ability to Lay Hands was a great boon to the group. A tank with two lives or the ability to save another with a touch of a button was a great asset indeed.<br>
<br>
Then we hit level 51, and 52, and 53, and so on. With each progressing level, our power was quickly fading, and we became unwanted in groups. Rangers had roughly the same AC as us, but dealt out massive amounts of damage, overshadowing a paladin completely. ShadowKnights were the kings of taunting, with thier line of necromantic spells. Warriors were vastly stronger than paladins, in nearly every area of a tank. What could we do then? We couldn't back up heal anymore, as Greater Healing and Superior healing was nothing but a bandaid to warriors. Our buffs were completely useless, as every group basically demands a cleric. We have two group friendly spell buffs.. Divine Glory and Divine Strength, but those only gave an extra 100-200 hp, and the Ranger line of group buffs (STR of Nature) was far more in demand, with giving 75hp and 25atk. <br>
The only thing we were good for, was our Lay of Hands, and that actually became a failure to groups. Once we used our LH, we couldn't do it again for another 72minutes. And often times, when the situation called for the Laying of Hands, the group was in so much trouble that everyone was going to die no matter what.<br>
<br>
On raids, we don't hold a candle to anyone else. Enchanters mana sieve and mez extras, as well as hasting the party. Druids could nuke and dot. Rangers, rogues, monks and warriors did damage. Wizards and mages nuked. Necromancers dot'd and summoned corpses. ShadowKnights pulled the area clean and once raid started, did thier damage too. Paladins? Know what I did my last raid? I was the sacrifice. The raid sent me out to die, because that was all I was useful for. I ran out, and placed Divine Aura upon myself, and let Trakanon follow me to the back of his lair before killing me in a matter of seconds. That's all paladins are good for now. Dying so the others can live.<br>
<br>
I have no pride in my class anymore. I used to be such an avid supporter of Paladins.. but I am just too depressed about them now. I sit at sebilis for hours, and sometimes wouldn't find a group in DAYS. I am not lying. I have been leveling so slowly, my friends pass me up. They are out there winning all sorts of really nice equipment, gaining levels 10 times as fast as I am, all the while I'm sitting at the zone LFG.<br>
<br>
What is there to be happy about in being a paladin? I have a nice sword, yes, but it's not that great now that I look at it. It's so slow, when I miss a swing, I lose out on alot of possible damage. I end up doing so little damage in fights, that I can barely taunt things anymore, especially if a ranger is in my group. My offensive spells are pathetic. I can stun a mob, and keep him stunned for a little while, but then my mana runs out after a few fights. My only dd does a pitiful 125 damage. All of my other equipment downright sucks at my level. I'm level 58, and have been playing for two years. I took my time to go to raids, and win my Valorium, and for awhile I was &quot;well equipped&quot;. But now, I pretty much need BETTER than that to be on par with the others at my level. Up until a few days ago, I still wore Adamantite Epaulets. Now I have an obulus death shroud. It's ok, but nothing like I wanted. I could raid the Hole for Granite Spaulders, but I'd never get that.<br>
<br>
I have tried to go on raids, but I just don't get invited. Nobody wants a paladin around, and although there will probably be some sympathy posts on this thread, everyone knows it's true. Paladins are useless.<br>
<br>
I'm level 58. A worthless, level 58 paladin. How I got this far amazes even me, and although I have alts, I don't care to take the time out to level them up high enough to replace Fenye.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't think I can find one thing useful about the paladin class other than being the &quot;lamb&quot; of the raids. <br>
<br>

Maybe it's just burnout or something but I swear it seems to happen to every class.<br>
<br>
Anyway, back to the paladins, the paladins' ability to stun might seem small to you, but imagine a ranger or rogue who has majorly aggroed the critter and getting pounded, his jolt was resisted or getting interrupted or evade not working, who else can get that critter off their backs? The paladin can either root or use his stuns to buy them time to either back away from the critter or for the healer to get a heal in. Sure SKs can also land a major taunt spell and get the critter to turn on himself, but my point is that paladins can do that too, and they have the AC and HPs to tank. Warriors on the other hand can only keep hitting that taunt key and hope that by some miracle he will shoot to the top of the hate list.<br>
<br>
As for the heals, sure, it's not as good as the other heals, but it's still good enough. So, no I do not think paladins are useless, I'd group with one any day. <p>Thormiel Stormblade <BR>

They really serve no good purpose in a group.. you cant say 'hey lets get a paladin for more damage' or 'that paladin can taunt off the ranger, lets get em.' In higher levels the way the group set up is essential to whether we're doing a cr soon or not, and it is most important to have only the most necessary classes. On my cleric I always thought it was nice to have a paladin that healed, they could take over during downtime and also keep the enchanter alive during the fight.<br>

Same with Karnors.  I, being a rogue, often judge a tnak by how often I have to evade, or how often I get hit.  With these two Pallys, I almost never got touched.  And, what's more, our group NEVER worried about a MOB healing itself, or gating.<br>
<br>
If I had to guess, I would say that Paladins don't have a specialized function, like many classes.  Instead, they can do several things, fairly well.  Another thing that I think may SEEM to make a Paladin worthless is the skill level to play one.  I have grouped with many paladin's that made me thing &quot;we should get someone else to fill their spot&quot;.  But when you group with one that knows their class...it's magic I tell ya!<br>

<br>
but hence, this is the way loosers go.<br>
<br>
Good players can do most stuff, replacing the Cleric by Paladin and Druid/Shaman, the Enchanter by a Necro/Bard and so on. Yes, it's a lot harder than the standard way, but it works, it's up to you to convince people. In high end game, it's all about having a puller of highest level possible, not even Monks are needed anymore. So much about exp groups.<br>
<br>
In raids, every class has their place, the taunting abilities of a Paladin is much better than the one of a Warrior, so i'd choose a Pally as main assist over a Warrior anytime.<br>

I can agree and relate to many parts of your post.  I've been playing my current character for a full year now.  I have a 52nd level human pally (retired), and my current is a 52nd level High elf pally.  I have always been fond of the paladin class.  I didn't like always being blind as a bat, and having low mana, so I created the high elf instead and focused more on cleric type skills.  <br>
<br>
One thing that I pride myself in is being a class that can do a little of everything.  We can't heal and buff like clerics, and we can't tank like warriors.  But we are probably the most well rounded class when it comes to those skills that respectively define those classes.  No other class can really stack up to our versatility.  Certainly, Lay on Hands is one of our defining traits, but we all know it's use is limited.  I believe our role is clearly a utility character.<br>
<br>
Frankly we don't go into every fight looking to tank like a warrior.  Rather a paladin has to adapt to the group which he/she is in and determine which style best suits that particular instance.  If your heavy on tanks, then a paladin may very well assist the cleric on healing and buffs.  If your group is caster heavy, then the paladin switches to tank mode and takes the brunt of the damage.  No other class can be as flexible, IMO.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on, but it's not going to be anything that hasn't been said before.  The paladin class is not useless as everyone seems to think.  IMHO, I think we will see a few more big changes to the class balancing within the next few months.  Perhaps this will change the way Paladins are perceived across the servers.  I guess we will just have to wait and see.  <br>
<br>
Good luck to you on your way to becoming a Crusader.<br>

to this one for the fellow paladins that are still<br>
playing.<br>
<br>
Playing a paladin is not all about the damage you can<br>
deal or sustain.  I enjoyed playing a paladin because<br>
of the many skills we had to choose from.  Granted we<br>
cannot out do a class that specializes in our skills, but<br>
within any group you get in your able to play with<br>
a set of skills to better the group. <br>
<br>
If you're looking to become more of a fighter than cleric,<br>
a group savior, or a battlebot tank, I'd recommend working<br>
towards getting more haste.   At my peak in gear, I enjoyed playing a part in Kill stealing.  I doubt the times have changed that much that people aren't using paladins.  <br>
<br>
As a High elf though, you're always going to be more inclined on the wisdom side of things versus having an<br>
advantage in tanking I would suspect.  Unless, you're really decked out with AC and haste.<br>

<br>
One great advantage to paladins is the mana-less heal from the deepwater helm.  Sure, its useless during combat, but during dowtime they can get the entire group to full health in good order.  Many times we use a druid as main healer, and they often are stretched for mana (as opposed to a cleric).  So this is a great feature of the class.<br>
<br>
But, giving it all a cold eye, many classes could make the same type of complaints.<br>
<br>
I am sure I could write an extended list of faults with warriors and mages.<br>
<br>
Play the class you like.  The game loses all fun when people start calculating that class A is 5% more effective then class B. <p><center><a href="http://pub66.ezboard.com/bsubatislowtomidlevelraidboard"><img src="http://www.dalbers.homestead.com/files/subsig2.jpg"></a><p>

I love paladins in my group. More so then ShadowKnights. They help me with healing a lot. While I'm trying to Get CHEAL off, they keep the tank alive. They are great with taunting and LoH is very useful.<br>
<br>
I rather have a Paladin in my group then a ranger or a ShadowKnight.<br>

<br>
A few are actually smart enough to play the class well, and are a huge asset to their group.<br>
<br>
I won't go off on a long ramble about how I see the Paladin's role on raids and in regular groups, but suffice it to say that at least 80% of Paladins I see play to about 30% of their potential abilities.<br>
<br>
It's those Paladins that give the class a bad name.  Nothing wrong with the class at all.   <p><html>

I wasn't paying attention to all the flames on you in the past that got you the rep you have today. I was of course neutral towards you since I didn't know you at all. I only noticed the turn around and everyone helping you and your attitude getting better. Then I saw you in CS a couple nights ago. You were dead and trying to get past the sirens to get into SG. I charged through and pulled the sirens and proceeded to lay waste with my group coming up behind me.<br>
<br>
I noticed Tanari was also trying to get through and sadly fell just as she got out of the water however I continued on. Things were going well and Foreman joined me in hacking the wenches to pieces and when he was charmed and started attacking me, the damage began to take it's toll. I called for a heal and Vidril and other's answered the call and I was soon fully healed with only 2 sirens left. At this point I was charmed for about 1.5 seconds and your heal hit me which I thank you for. However, your spell did not stick and you said something to the effect of &quot;the idiot went LD&quot;.<br>
<br>
I asked who you were refering to and you said it was me. I informed you that when charmed or feared, it will appear that way and all you had to say was &quot;oh&quot;. Never got an apology from you and I certainly don't expect it.<br>
<br>
I never was one of the ones bashing you. I just simply didn't know you. Seeing your attitude in action, though opened my eyes. Perhaps you need to work on it some more is all I can say. You'd be suprised how many people will want to group with you when they're not in fear of being called childish names. <br>
<br>
Just a suggestion...<br>

I mean, &quot;the vision&quot; according to Verant is an attempt to keep all classes as closely balanced as possible. BUT if at some point you think your class sucks and you have no fun playing it anymore then stop playing that class. Make a new charatcer. If you don't want to give up your old character cause it takes to long to get that far with a new one, then suck it up, keep playing your main and find a way around the problems. Sending an e-mail to Verant saying you can't get a group won't make them change anything. I've had lots of friends that just became dissillusioned with the game and stopped playing for like 6 months! They came back though, they exp hunt sometimes, sometimes they hunt for trade skill materials. But if your sole purpose in this game to get exp as fast as possible, then sometimes you are going to have to accept that you won't find a group (at least not in some of the highest traffic areas). Everyone is entitled to get frustrated, but bitching about your class doesn't solve anything *shrug* Find solutions instead of pointing out problems. It can be done, those 60th lvl Paladins out there are a testament to what a Paladin with perseverence can do. <p>Scaleroo Lizziekins

Paladins are supposed to be part cleric part warrior, i guess verant intended at 50+ for them to be the weak parts of those classes.<br>
Fenye herself is a good tank, i grouped with her once and she did very well.<br>
I agree, paladins should be more powerful, after all, they're KNIGHTS and CRUSADERS! <p><img src="http://members.home.net/cgoebel5/sig/Yshaasig.jpg"><br>Yshaa Suppaheala<br>

Groups with a warrior may not want to recruit a paladin since they have a tank, but just adapt.  I'm a little cross at my damage output, and I'm wielding a 32/36 axe with dragon haste... but that hasn't stopped me.<br>
<br>
Also, Granite spaulders in the hole isn't so rough, it's just lucky.  Kaycee and I decided we needed those shoulders and out of 3 trips to the hole in one week, we looted 2 shoulders which we were after.<br>
<br>
The key is to not give up, tenacity makes up for a lot of other failings.<br>
