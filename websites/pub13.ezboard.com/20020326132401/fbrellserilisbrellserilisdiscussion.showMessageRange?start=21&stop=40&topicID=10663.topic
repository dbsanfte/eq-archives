Got tired of Pre-pubescent kids and the whole attitude of PVPers.  (Thats why I never went to DAoC as well).  With a couple real life friends we planned our group - Cleric, Warrior and my mage.  We liked the idea of an extra tank and a blaster in one for our group.<br>
<br>
We all met in Freeport and played.  The cleric left the game, the warrior is a retired character and only Madrix still sees playing time.<br>
<br>
We chose Brell because of lower population. <p><p align="center">

A small knot of us decided to play it and wanted to go PvP.  So I created a cleric named Solitaire in a guild named Blood Coven on Rallos.  I had fun and ran my cleric to 23, but quickly grew tired of the stress.  This was back when folks would charm you and make you fight guards and naked casters ruled the day.  I then noticed that Brell would be opening soon, and it got that unofficial tag as an RP server, so I made my plans to leave.<br>
<br>
The day Brell opened, I created my first bard, Jesip, Half Elf male.  I ran him up to 23 too, then decided I did not feel comfortable playing a male character and decided to recreate myself into Tatter.  You can only emote grabbing your crotch so many times. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I chose a bard from the skill set listed.  I would be able to do alot of different things, but would not be the &quot;best&quot; at it; and it's worked great so far.  I enjoy being the glue for most groups.<br>

I knew nobody in EQ, looked at the server list, went from the top down, didn't like how Bertox sounded, so just clicked Brell.<br>
<br>
I started as a rogue thinking they'd be similar to a rogue in Diablo.  I quickly learned it was a completely different game, and at level 5 decided to trek to Freeport to see the fabled commonlands.  When the boat pulled up a monk ran off and I thought he was the coolest looking thing in the world (why? who knows, was just in leather).  So went and made a monk. Why human?  Wasn't much a choice, Iksar were fugly :P<br>

So i started up, I made a rogue and lasted until level 15 or so, i just liked the idea of them with being sneaky and stuff. Then i read this book and monks look really cool. I always enjoyed safe fall on the rogue and i thought that i could use all the disciplines (round kick, tiger claw, eaglie strike, etc.) at the same time. That sounded cool to me. So after i was proven wrong at level 10 or something, i still decided to play him coz i was poor as hell and i liked punching things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So that was that, Niteraptor is still here to this day.

I grew rather dis-enchanted with him and decided that I was going to move to the first new server that they brought online..  As luck had it, it was Brell.<br>
As far as choosing a cleric, I had played a Dwarf Paly in beta and grouped a good bit with a high elf cleric named Bmills.  It didn't take long before I realized how valuable an asset a cleric could be, so thus Truedy was born.<br>
I have always liked the Dwarves as a class and the starting area was pretty good.  That and I had a good idea of who what when where and why to kill to get to level 30 or so and never leave home.  (not that I followed that plan, just that I had one at the time, haha)<br>
As far as the name Truedy, to be honest I am not sure where the hell I came up with that, and 50% of the ppl I meet think Truedy is a Female...  arghhh  <br>

<br>
I chose a gnome warrior because I wanted to hunt with my friends that were high lvl and fighting at orc hill. I didnt like the helms of the Wood elf warriors nor did I have any desire to be a tree stump(dorf) so I chose a Gnome. <br>
<br>
If was tough coming up as a gnome warrior because there really wasnt any around and people didnt really know a gnome could be a good warrior. Gnome warriors were always pigonholed into the &quot;slash an dash&quot; as opposed to the true warrior. Even in the threads and that talked about what race makes good warriors people talked about gnome warriors they were comic relief as opposed to being a true warrior.<br>
<br>
Well they were wrong. I would never trade any warrior for Anshar. I know my stats maybe be a tad lower than most of the people I raid with but fully buffed with 6k in HPs and 1600AC Anshar can hold his on. <br>

In fact, I think I was the highest for awhile.<br>
<br>
The account my Shadowknight was on (Karjia) was also being used by Raylen after he saw me playing the game for a couple of months. I gradually grew disinterested in EverQuest so I let him take over my account until I decided to come back.<br>
<br>
Well September of 2000, I was debating with the notion of coming back or not. Debating, Debating. I never followed through with it due to lack of money. Cause I'd have to buy a new account due to Ray being such a high level.<br>
<br>
Around CHristmas I got some money, so I went out and got a new account and everything. Raylen said his guild &quot;Skyre Draneth&quot; needed some Cleric's. I never played a Cleric before so it seemed fun. I wanted to be a Gnome or and Erudite Cleric but Ray said no, their wisdom sucked and told me to make a HIgh Elf. So I did.<br>
<br>
I still regret to this day on not being a Gnome or Erudite Cleric =( However, I don't regret coming from Fennin Ro to Brell. I found out later that Fennin Ro has turned to @#%$ and that even the Guide's and GM's hate working there. <p><center>OMG Miltant Penguins!~!~@@~ We are all going to DIE~!~!<br><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~rt924/Tigbanner.JPG"></img><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63137">~My Icky Stuff~</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushadextinkerdink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadex Tinkerdink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 4:02:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10663.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   well</span><hr size=1> I came to brell because rl friends made me.

I played up to around 6 or so, but I couldn't really get into the game.  I tried some other low level characters, played them up to 10 or so, then finally got sick and quit.  I came back a few months later, picked the server with the fewest people (Brell) and started playing a gnome mage, Magnitanis.  I got him up to 12, then I introduced my friend to the game and he started a gnome enchanter (Balren).  We levelled up in crushbone to around 12, then my friend made a gnome warrior (Zaniken) and I made a halfling druid (Punca) and brought them up to around 5.  We were in Crystalline Guard at this point... that was when Zan called it quits and made his war a dwarf with real stats!  His name was, incidentally, Anihhillus.  we got up to around level 12 and were running through BB and hunting at the chessboard when we saw this tall black guy in a dress (Invertigo) who invited us into a new guild full of uber peeps! Imperium!  And... um... we hung around in there into our 40s, then I decided to play a rogue, got him up to 52 while ani got to 54 then we moved to Order of Eternity and there we are now!  In between I have played all manner of alts and levelled a lot of junky characters even into the 20s and then deleted them.  I have played every single class, and many times multiple races of the same class.  My current favorite is my Monk.  They're just so much fun! <p><br>Pokis - 52 Rake<br>

A RL friend told him about brell so he switched. He made a halfing druid because they could cast spells heh. Then he told me I should make a character, and at first I wanted to make a warrior dwarf but he told me palys were better cause they could cast spells( was he right, who knows ). <br>
<br>
So Meevroy(dorf paly) and Cettun(halfing druid) were created-on the same account. At first I kinda thought EQ was stupid, cause up to that point I was never into computer games. Well eventually I we grew into our characters, made friends, learned skills, and learned to be a good auctioner(well my brother is good at it at least). I made my current main Luchang, after seeing Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon, cause i wanted to kick ass like those guys in the movie did hehe. So i lvled him to 20 played other chars eventually came back to luchang and continually lvled him up to 52 where he is today. I still enjoy playing luchang, but its tough competing with all the great, and some VERY twinked monks, of today. So when im sick of him i log on my shaman Maximon, 34 ogre whom i have a lot of fun with. We both kinda play the same characters now which also makes lvling em easier. Thats about it here....<br>

I had just finished reading one of the Tolkein books so I decided to be a halfling. I wanted to be a meleer and chose warrior. I chose Fennin cause I thought a high population was better. I played a few months there and got to level 17. I was getting bored with that server and decided to move to a new one. During that time I saw EQFest 2000 being advertised, and I live in Houston so I decided to sign up. I decided to move to Brell because the organizer (Ron Pinkerton, Guntar) was on that server. I created a paladin and got him to level 12, and I was in envy of all those necromancers soloing those guards, so I created Vumyan, DE Necro. I loved it and stayed with it.<br>
That's about it.<br>

<br>
Back before everquest I played a game called Legends of Kesmia (LoK for short). I had made alot of really good friends on that game. One day the people of Ultima Online came along and bought out LoK, then decided that the few hundred people that played it should be playing UO. So they shut down LoK and sent us all a free month of UO and a disk (whoopee). Well about a month or two before LoK was completly lost forever the brell server opened, and my guild leader and a few friends started playing EQ. Well I decided to stay with LoK to the very end, but was told if I ever wanted to play EQ to come to the Brell server because a few remnaints of my guild and a few others were there..... As you see, I am now on brell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
As for my character choice, I astually started as a Human partially because my good friend and former guild leader (Renzokuken btw.) said not to pick a human LOL. I had started as a human paladin but he met with an accident at 4am when I thought the delete key was the exit button... luckily he was only level 10. So I started an enchanter because I knew a little about the game and liked the jewlery idea (I was a newbie, what do you expect?), but since I had never been past EC or N ro I went with what I knew and made a human enchanter.<br>
<br>
Well there is alot more to it all, but that was the condenced version, and that all happened almost 2 years ago... I have been happy here ever since, made good friends and plan to stay another 2 if I can.<br>

They all talked about moving to Brell when it opened and the &quot;unofficial RP&quot; appealed to me. Created a woodelf druid, levelled to 15 and quit. I was one of the first people in Children of the Mother when it was formed,(was supposed to be in the first 10 to create, but rl kept me from being logged in at the time) but didn't really play long enough to get to know anyone. <br>
<br>
Came back last fall and didn't know anyone playing anywhere except one friend on another server (never found out which one) and one on AR. Decided I didn't want to pick a server based on where my friends are (they don't play all that much) so I researched who had a better sense of community. The Brell boards are some of the most active of any server and the fact that everyone could come together and make rotations for the high end game led me to believe that the friendliest people were on Brell. Restarted my druid as a human (love playing druid, but like to be different, hehe how is that possible). Had a blast ever since and even got one of the friends to switch servers. <br>
