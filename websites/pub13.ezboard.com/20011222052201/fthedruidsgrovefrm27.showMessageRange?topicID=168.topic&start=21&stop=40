<br>
Point 1 is basically that Mythic doesn't want you to take up server resources unless you are actively playing the game.  However, alt-tabbing out and back in is no different than going AFK, or doing something else while your character stands or sits there in the game (e.g., read a book, watch TV, etc.).   While I understand the business and financial motive here, it has nothing to do with "cheating."<br>
<br>
And while I agree that you shouldn't be running other applications that take up your comp resources while playing DAoC because it can impact the performance of the game for you, if you are alt-tabbing out, that's not really a concern, is it?<br>
<br>
BTW, if they want to get rid of "sitting in our game taking up our server's cycles and bandwidth that other, more active players could put to better use," then they ought to make horses run faster...much faster. <br>
<br>
In addition, I don't know if this program "hacks the client" or works more "between" the client and the OS, as Tudamorf described.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulilwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LilWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/8/01 10:30:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I have to agree with Scirocco</span><hr size=1> I don't think its cheating at all.<br>

Come on.  My computer can handle the bandwidth and the background processes.  I can set it up so that all background processes get equal attention.  <br>
<br>
If they don't want to waist their server bandwidth.  Great, dont.  How about when it's minimized, it doesn't update but once every 30 seconds or something.  <br>
<br>
I get a little annoyed when companies (Verant) think that the only thing I'm interested in is looking at a spell book when I'm waiting.  Come on.  DAoC has taken care of a bunch of downtime issues.  Decreasing it was great.  But still.  <br>
<br>
I'm a programmer with a family and no time.  I get maybe an hour here and there to play.  I would love to have a text editor running so I can program in the background.... or worse yet, a development system (ok, jbuilder is a resource hog also.... but I should be able to choose).  How about just starting a CD?  <br>
<br>
I can understand that they feel that if its minimized (or windowed?  does your solution put it in a window?) then they feel like we are cheating them.. but we really aren't.  I wouldn't care if we didn't get updates as often.  Worse come to worse, you die every so often.<br>

<br>
You don't necessarily have to violate the agreement to get banned.  The relationship between you and Mythic is a voluntary one on both sides.  "Banned" is just a colorful way of saying they've decided not to sell you any more services.<br>
<br>
Of course, we don't know at this point how Mythic would respond.  As far as I know, they've never claimed that minimizing the game would be cheating, only that it facilitates cheating, so therefore they've designed the game to disallow it.  Personally, I like playing the game and don't feel like suing my way back in, so I'll wait before trying out any minimizing utility.<br>

<br>
True, with one caveat:  if they do it in bad faith, they have a lawsuit on their hands.  Not to mention some very pissed off customers.  Neither are exactly the ideal situation in this precarious and competitive market.  Also, I'm sure M$ won't be pleased that a game designer using their API and OS is crippling the OS and terminating player accounts for using legitimate M$ OS features.<br>
<br>
If I were Mythic and had a bit of common sense, I would look at all the bitterness towards the other MMRPG game companies and try to come out as the good guy.  That means compromising my (Mythic's) position where it's a feature the consumer wants and would have no practical effect on gameplay or the bottom line.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately (?) for me, I use the "multiple boxes" method of multitasking -- and probably will unless AMD comes out with a 20Ghz nanotransistor CPU soon.

Do you feel the same way about your obligations to Mythic?  If you cancel your account without a good reason, would they be justified in suing you for bad faith?  Or do you feel that you can cancel your account whenever you choose, for whatever reason you choose?<br>
<br>
As for pissing off their customers, naturally they've got to be worried about that.  At the same time, they've got to be worried about how pissed people will be if cheating becomes widespread.  I don't necessarily like their alt-tab policy, but I understand their rationale.<br>

<br>
The issue isn't whether you have a "good reason", but rather whether you are doing it for a "bad" reason.  Terminating users who are just using features of their OS (not in violation of the agreement) would be a "bad" reason in this case.<br>
<br>
As for the user, given the nature of the subscription, it's rather hard for them to cancel in bad faith.  I suppose if someone found an exploit that allows them to get more than one free month, and they cancel on the 30th day to prevent detection, that would be bad faith.  But usually, it will be because they don't like the game any more, which is as valid a reason as any. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 5:48:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Technically, it's the "covenant of good faith and fair dealing," and it's implied by law in all contracts.

In contracts where one party has "sole discretion" to do something, or the right to take unilateral action, this is usually interpreted to mean that the party with that discretion will exercise its discretion in good faith.  "Sole discretion" is usually determined to just identify which party it is that is expected to act in such a manner; it doesn't relieve them of the obligation to act in good faith. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulilwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LilWolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 8:29:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My main question</span><hr size=1> If I use a program so I can get work done on my downtime, or start another CD is Mystic going to come looking for me?<br>

<br>
It’s really not that universal.  It appears that Virginia, for instance, where Mythic is located and whose law governs the EULA, does not recognize such an implied covenant in ordinary contracts.<br>
<br>
And even if it did, good faith is actually a pretty low standard of conduct.  A “bad reason,” as someone put it, really isn’t enough – “bad motive” would be closer.  You can be dead wrong and still act in good faith.  You can be objectively unreasonable and still act in good faith.  As long as Mythic sincerely believes that they’re acting for the good of the game, they’re probably in the clear as far as “good faith” goes.  Disproving that would be an awfully tough task, unless you’ve got some peculiar circumstances (e.g., Mythic employees have a personal grudge against you).<br>
<br>
<b>As for the user, given the nature of the subscription, it's rather hard for them to cancel in bad faith. ... But usually, it will be because they don't like the game any more, which is as valid a reason as any.</b><br>
<br>
So do you think that Mythic has a valid reason for cancelling your account if they just don't like selling you the game any more?<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you're using a double standard for this "good faith" obligation.  When discussing Mythic's actions, you suggest that they have a "bad reason" for canceling if the user is "not in violation of the agreement."  But when discussing the users, you say that they can cancel just because "they don't like the game any more," which has nothing to do with whether Mythic has violated the agreement.<br>
<br>
Can one party cancel the agreement in good faith even if the other party hasn't violated it?  If so, why can't Mythic cancel for use of a minimizing utility (even if it doesn't violate the agreement)?  If not, why can the user terminate in good faith just because he doesn't like the game any more?<br>

<br>
Point being that they don't necessarily have full rights to drop everyone's account if they want.  They are still bound by the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<br>
<br>
With regard to Virginia law, two points.  First, you are presuming that Virginia law will apply.  That may not be the case, since the sale of the game actually took place in many states.  And I don't know about you, but there's no-click-through-EULA when I start DAoC (and even if there were, the validity of such clickwrap licenses remains questionable in consumer transactions).<br>
<br>
Second, Virginia law does appear to be unsettled on this point.  Several cases do say that there is no implied covenant where there are binding and valid contractual rights expressly created, but others say something along the following lines:<br>
<br>
<i> While this contract does not fall within the scope of the Uniform Commercial <br>
Code in effect in Virginia, that code does legislatively impose a duty of good<br>
faith on the performance of all contracts falling under the U.C.C.  <=73> <br>
Virginia Code @ 8.1-203. One circuit court in Virginia has stated broadly that<br>
every contract contains an implied duty of good faith in its performance. <br>
 <=74>  Stepp v. Outdoor World Corp., 18 Va. Cir. 106, 111 (1989) (real estate<br>
 contract) . Michie's Jurisprudence uses similar broad language:  <=210>  "The<br>
law implies a  covenant of good faith  . . . in every  contract  . . . ." 4B<br>
M.J.,  Contracts,  20 (Cum. Supp. 1993). This is consistent with the Restatement<br>
(Second) of Contracts @ 205 (1981), which states the majority opinion in courts <br>
nationwide. In addition, the legislature in Virginia in essence has mandated<br>
that an insurance company act toward its insured in good faith.  <=75>  Va. Code<br>
@ 38.2-510(6). Provisions of the insurance sections of the Virginia Code have<br>
often been ruled to be implied conditions of an insurance contract by the<br>
Virginia Supreme Court. See, e.g.,  <=76>  State Farm v. Duncan, 203 Va. 440,<br>
125 S.E.2d 154 (1962). The Fourth Circuit found that the responsibility set out <br>
in  <=77>  Virginia Code[**31] @ 38.1-52.9(6) (now @ 38.2-510(6)), parallels an <br>
insurer's contractual duty of good faith.   <=78>  A & E, supra, 798 F.2d at<br>
676.<br>
<br>
   Based on much of the authority cited above, the Fourth Circuit opined that<br>
the Virginia Supreme Court would imply such a duty of good faith on [*568] all<br>
contracting parties in performing duties under an agreement.   <=79>  A & E<br>
Supply Co., supra, 798 F.2d at 676.  <=211>  Bad faith conduct gives rise to a<br>
contract action, not a tort suit, as the duty arises from and extends only to<br>
the agreement itself.   <=80>  Id. at 676.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
An interesting legal issue...at least for the Virginia lawyers.<br>

We heard this type of reaction in EQ, AC, AO and now DAoC. Does anyone know if anyone EVER attempted to launch a class action against any of the aforementioned games? Nope, sure haven't, even though we see threats like this on a weekly basis in EQ. Any lawyer would laugh even a possible client out the door due to the miniscule payout. If anything you'd, at the most, get your monthly fee back. How much of that would actually see your wallet? Nothing, in fact I can guarantee you'd be broke due to the largish legal fees affiliated with class action suits.<br>
<br>
So what was the point of the above? Take the EULA/TOS and understand they can ban your account for anything they deem fit. The only people who are even affected by this are the crackers and people playing at work. Need quest info? You sure don't need to tab out to find it, /yell for info. Need a map? Print it up before you go ingame.<br>
<br>
They created the client they way they thought would reduce cracking and cheating. If alt-tab is blocked to prevent that, then you either suck it back and deal with it or quit playing. Feel the need to attempt a class action? Like I said, go talk to a lawyer, you'll get laughed right out of his office. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 5:31:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ;)</span><hr size=1> EQAquinas says:  <b><i>So do you think that Mythic has a valid reason for cancelling your account if they just don't like selling you the game any more?</b></i><br>
<br>
Yes.  For example, if sales were low and they decided to discontinue the service, they wouldn't be acting in bad faith.  Or, if they decided to cut 10% of their play base (randomly chosen) to reduce costs, they wouldn't be acting in bad faith.  Hence, no double standard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueqaquinas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQAquinas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/9/01 8:31:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Scirocco: We'd best just agree to disagree.

<br>
Huh?  I am neither playing at work, nor a cracker, and it affects me.  I like to listen to music while I play games.  If I want to change the song that's playing, I can't alt-tab out to do so.  If I want to use an instant messenger during my downtime, I can't.  If I accidentally hit the windows key, minimizing DAoC, I'm screwed.  There is a plethora of legitimate uses for alt-tabbing; just because you don't have any doesn't mean that no one does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/10/01 2:40:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> Um, Griif, lots of people use their computers for things other than getting info about a game they're playing on it.  Given the fact that the game does have down time, or that circumstances frequently arise where you need to turn your attention to other things briefly (e.g., your spouse asks you to check to see if an email has come in), then alt-tabbing out and in is certainly legitimate.  <br>
<br>
<b>Like I said, go talk to a lawyer, you'll get laughed right out of his office. </b><br>
<br>
I don't need to do that.  I can laugh in my own office. I AM an attorney, after all (intellectual property and commercial litigation).  The fact that I came up with a quotation from a Virginia court pretty quickly should have told you that).  <br>
<br>
We don't need to get into legal technicalities, of course...unless someone else brings them up by making unsupported assertions about how some game company can do whatever they want.  My point is that, legally, that assumption is not warranted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uexquisitesin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Exquisitesin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/10/01 4:14:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alt-tab (background) functionality restored</span><hr size=1> if it helps any of those that use winamp, you can download a plug in called SneakyAmp which I have - it allows you to give basic commands to Winamp - whatever piece of software you are running.<br>
<br>
For example if I'm playing DAOC or Q3 or something, if I press FFGGH - where FF stands for activation, GG stands for next track and H confirms, Winamp will skip to the next track on my play list.<br>
<br>
I customed those commands myself, you can set them waht you want<br>
