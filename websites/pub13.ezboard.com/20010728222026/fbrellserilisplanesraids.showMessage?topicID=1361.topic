I will try and clear the whole issue by doing this.<br>
<br>
Please stay truthfull.<br>
<br>
<br>
Zesty first please answer this:<br>
<br>
When you made the rules for FGs did you or did you not believe FGs was a 8 hour spawn?<br>
<br>
If you believed the spawn time was 8 hours then by tamianx assumption the raid difference should have been 10 hours to leave time for the random spawn cycle that he talks about?<br>
<br>
If this was not made it must have been the intent of the rules that FGs are a set spawn that makes them all spawn at the exact time?<br>
<br>
Tamianx please answer this:<br>
<br>
Did you or anyone on your raid run past the bridge that leads to the FGs at exactly 9 pm EST to check if the Fire Giants had spawned?<br>
<br>
At exactly 9.40 pm EST Kityania send me a tell saying you were still sitting in stoney room waiting for people to log off and clear lagg. This infact is a much later delay of the raid than you by your own words estimated that the FGs was spawned at. How come if time was so important to you, that you wasnt even ready to charge in when you knew the FGs 100% was fully popped all the way through?<br>
<br>
Exactly what people on your raid was not able to go or meet up and participate in the FG raid cause of our actions?<br>
<br>
<br>
Saphia please answer this:<br>
<br>
Have you or have you not participated in a fear raid that Pushed the spawn of Europa Tribes raid with more than 8 hours?<br>
<br>
If this is so, have you ever apoligized or in any way explained why you participated in making this delay on the ET raid out here in puplic?<br>
<br>
<br>
Its all very simple Questions where I think the answers by themselves should clear the matter. If anyone feel this whole thing is so important that you should disclude ET members from raids then please feel free. Im tired of argueing against people with a problem that never eksisted in the first place..<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

<br>
<br>
Since you are asking...man I thought you took enough punishment for one sitting....<br>
<br>
Did you honestly read the thread?  Really?  You would see that I was not on this particular one.  I in fact do have fg's scheduled and also have been apart of the fiasco that your guild caused with AOW's fear raid (needed to learn how to add better in order to figure in repops).  I have also SEEN what you have written here about the FG's.  I also was talking to Tamianx here and there about your reservation.  It is no secret that you find this board's rules non applicable to you.  You even state so much as that in Tamianx screenshot that is now in rants.  Yet you call Tami a liar saying you never said such things.  No one needs to be subject to your stomping of raids in order to know what you did was wrong.<br>
<br>
I don't OWE you an apology or ET.  Fact: Tami posted his intent and TIME to do fg's.  You posted AFTER tami with not enough time for repop - pushing his raid out.  Look at the screen shot and then tell me who should apologize.  Period.<br>
<br>
If you had come to the thread and explained some things, you may have not been flamed so bad, but the fact is you didn't.  You made ridiculous excuses and false accusations and called everyone liars.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think you've shown your true colors.  I'd quit while you still have a following.<br>

Since Lanos is comparing the fg's to AOW/ET mess I wanted to state this for the record.  In that raid, ET scheduled their raid 12 or 13 hours after AOW's. If any little thing went wrong, the mobs would not be repopped for ET's.  AOW's raid was delayed significantly about 2 hours if I remember right due to no shows, and cr, and the by the time cazic repopped, the raid had just gotten to the nw corner about an hour after the actual start of the fighting.  The raid leader of ET's raid WAS consulted, and told AOW that it was OK for them to continue the raid.  The raid leader ET even posted it on these boards that he consented when this issue came up in rants.  AOW, was not up in fear more than 12 hours.  The difference between this issue Lanos, and AOW's issue, is they did not schedule their raid exactly 12 hours or less before your raid and intentionally cause your raid to be delayed. ET scheduled the raid 12 hours after them.  What is also different I think (not sure from not reading all the threads) is that AOW consulted the raid leader who gave AOW the ok to continue the raid.  I think AOW at least showed respect to ET, even though you or some other members did not like it, they made a good faith effort to discuss the matter with the raid leader.  To me it was more of a breakdown of communication between the raid leader and the other members of the raid, than an intentional disregard of the rules at the expense of someone else.<br>
<br>
I personally hold no grudges, nor am I upset about anything that happened after that raid and subsequent rant.  I just do not think your comparing apples to apples here.  Please note that some of my comments are not implying, Lanos did not make a good faith effort to work it out.  I am not trying to imply or insult anyone, other than to state that the aow/et incident was a totally different animal to this, and as such should not be part of the argument.<br>

<br>
You started killing after CT popped the zone even before talking with Ryen, he said okay to 3 or 4 hours delay as you said it would be. But you delayed our raid with more than 8 hours.<br>
<br>
There was an exact 15hour and 30 min time difference between AOW's raid and ours.<br>

If you wanted to know Zesty.<br>

I still believe that the 8 hours rule was made by the assumption that the FG spawn was 8 hours when this was voted on. Tamianx made another assumption which is the reason that he is flaming us in the first place, Im merely trying to prove that he is not right.<br>

<br>
While I don't feel complied to answer to &quot;bend the truth for you to look good&quot; questions, especially after you so fragrantly broke the FG rules on both of your last two posts, and denying the fact of your statements.  You stated I was the liar, hrm .. I think I proved it was the other way around.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
Did you or anyone on your raid run past the bridge that leads to the FGs at exactly 9 pm EST to check if the Fire Giants had spawned?<br>
-------<br>
<br>
I corrected your very inaccurate times of where we were and when we went in.  Before you state timings, you might ask the same question to yourself that you ask Saphdia .. were you there? NO!<br>
<br>
-------<br>
At exactly 9.40 pm EST Kityania send me a tell saying you were still sitting in stoney room waiting for people to log off and clear lag. This in fact is a much later delay of the raid than you by your own words estimated that the FGs was spawned at. How come if time was so important to you, that you wasn't even ready to charge in when you knew the FGs 100% was fully popped all the way through?<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Again, permitting your ignorance, FG's are a 6 hour spawn with a factor.  We did not move into Stoney until about the time your claiming (the half hour your stating now, not the 2 hours you stated in previous posts), as we staged entering to allow a 6 hour window (Which was 9:30 based upon your last kill).  As I am sure your not aware this FG raid was a raid training session for the new GR folk (including younger additions.  Stepping through the raid, AS WE SEE FIT, is our business.  Logging to clear lag is OUR BUSINESS.  Sitting in Stoney to do this is OUR BUSINESS (which, I still ask how you managed to turn our 15-20 min in stoney into 2 hours /shrug).  I will say this, the arrogance, breaking the rules, and treading on others examples you set did help us show our folks the impact of what happens if they did the same.  I think the learned it well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
-------<br>
Exactly what people on your raid was not able to go or meet up and participate in the FG raid cause of our actions?<br>
-------<br>
<br>
Why would this be relevant?<br>
<br>
-------<br>
ohh I did try and work it out with Tamianx he was the one that refused to work anything out.<br>
-------<br>
<br>
You must be, by far, the most ignorant individual I have ever met on this sever.  You break the 8 hour rule of the server, continue killing FG's until 5:30 hours before our scheduled START time, claim that because we move in a half hour later than our start we are wrong for being upset, book a entire day of FG's not a day later, respond 'you did not agree to the rules', made no compromises, and have the guts to say &quot;I refused to work anything out&quot;.  <br>
<br>
You came here and tred to point out that I am wrong .. you failed.  YOU broke the rules, I did not.  I AGREE with the rules .. YOU DON'T.  YOU talk out of your ass (see quotes re-epic, times, etc.), I DON'T.<br>

<br>
Um...<br>
<br>
-----<br>
I still believe that the 8 hours rule was made by the assumption that the FG spawn was 8 hours when this was voted on. Tamianx made another assumption which is the reason that he is flaming us in the first place, I'm merely trying to prove that he is not right.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
What assumption was that?  That the RULE states 8 hours?  Hrm .. I would go check it, Lanos, before you stated that.<br>
<br>
<br>
---- ADDED ----<br>
<br>
-----<br>
the screenshot proves nothing other than the fact that Tamianx threaten me with ruining our fear raid and used Caps when talking with me.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Ok .. I figured that would come up so lets talk about what was said before and after the screen shot.  Basically we bantered and no effort on Lanos's part was made to stop running into our scheduled time.  He mentioned the 6 hour spawn, which I reiterated the 8 hour rule .. nothing more than I had done.  Statement back is they are 6 hours, 8 hour rule basically did mean anything .. you can see that for yourself in one of his responses .. as to how he feels about rules period.<br>
<br>
The Fear statement was to point out that fear is scheduled on a daily basis, but an argument that it could be used twice a day could be made under the arguments he made.  On that basis, and as symbolic, why should not GR break the rules as Lanos did, run an earlier raid, and say oops when he is impacted by the same issues and responded to him in the same manner he did us.<br>
<br>
/shrug .. don't see anything wrong in that.  As for GR ever doing that, I more than clarified that in another thread.<br>
<br>
As for using caps .. /shrug .. if I was face to face with you, I would have been IN YOUR FACE .. just making a point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You need to grow up or something.. Seriously, I can understand anyone disagreeing. This whole issue with Lano's and Fg's people will disagree.  Thats ok, really it is.  You on the other hand offer NOTHING to the thread.  you do NOTHING to help the situation.

<br>
You keep personal attacking me instead of actually talking about what damage was done.<br>
<br>
you keep refering to rules that was passed by a vote that less than 1% of the server knew about and that had false information to vote for in the first place.<br>
<br>
Since the 3 FGs inside naggys lair are a 5 hour spawn I think. Then the last Giant was killed about 5 hours and 50 minutes before your raid.<br>
<br>
The first 3 giants including the roamer(which is also a faster spawn) was killed 6 hours and 15 minutes before your raid.<br>
<br>
Since you are not able to start with the Last giant but have to start with killing the first giants. What does it matter when the last one died?<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the only delay to the raid that you talk about are 30 min that you allowed to pass cause you wanted to be sure that there would be no spawn issues.<br>
<br>
But this is something that you choose to do. No one forced you to do this. If you had proceeded with your raid at the exact stated time, what are your proof that you would have had any spawn problems all the way through the raid?<br>
<br>
<br>
Your posted screenshot proves exactly how you handled the situation all the way through our tells. I tried to explain to you very calmly what was the reason for our delayed raid and that it would indeed be very close to yours but I think it would work out. All you did was use caps and tell me how you would get us banned from everything on the board and on the server. Even your own screenshot shows your methods of negotiation, by threatning with ruining our fear raid the day after.<br>

Lanos the answer to your question would be in being able to tell time correctly. If you plan on killing Ragefire within 6 hours of a scheduled FG raid, then you need to coordinate with the raid leader.<br>
<br>
If it's not going to be within 6 hours, then kill away.<br>
<br>
And I don't wanna hear about the time zone bullshit. <br>
<br>
(We killed the Fire giants 6 hours and 15 min before a sheduled raid)<br>
<br>
Basicly all of Tamianx flaming is cause of a theory that he have with the intent of the set timer for FG raid. The flame was not made cause of any problems he encountered with the raid he had after ours. I am still missing proof that our raid in any way interfered.<br>

-----<br>
Tamianx I keep reading your post and the only arrogance I find in all these are by you.<br>
<br>
You keep personal attacking me instead of actually talking about what damage was done.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Lets face it, I am pissed.  You come to these boards, I stated the details, and you whisk them off.  Your attempting to post things in a light that makes you look good.  The facts are still there that you lied, broke the rules, stated you don't agree with the rules, and continue to demonstrate that. <br>
<br>
We have a phrase &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot;.  Your now experiencing the bliss part .. you only see that your right, and don't see that your actions impact others.<br>
<br>
------<br>
you keep referring to rules that was passed by a vote that less than 1% of the server knew about and that had false information to vote for in the first place.<br>
------<br>
<br>
So, I think we further see that regardless of the rules you will find issue with them and ignore them to your benefit.  Seems what your saying Lanos.  If you are not comfortable with the rules, the correct action is make an attempt to change them .. not to break them.<br>
<br>
<br>
------<br>
Since the 3 FGs inside naggys lair are a 5 hour spawn I think. Then the last Giant was killed about 5 hours and 50 minutes before your raid.<br>
<br>
The first 3 giants including the roamer(which is also a faster spawn) was killed 6 hours and 15 minutes before your raid.<br>
<br>
Since you are not able to start with the Last giant but have to start with killing the first giants. What does it matter when the last one died?<br>
------<br>
<br>
<br>
First, it sounds like your not even sure as to the spawn times.  If your not EXACTLY sure, don't use them to your benefit.  The BEST I understand and have experienced has been 6 hours with a plus/minus time factor.  Those are what I see folks continue to say, and those are what I will raid by.<br>
<br>
Second, why would I choose to subject newbie raiders to re-pop issues when I don't not have to.  <br>
<br>
Third, why should I have been affected in the first place.  YOU should NEVER have posted a start time 6 hours before ours. Period .. end of that subject.<br>
<br>
Further, the last one was killed (per one of your own members) 5 hours and 30 min prior to our scheduled start.  By your own words, FG's are a 30 min raid (maybe for you, but not newbies).  Factoring in the time you started, the factor of the respawn, issues that may have occurred, time of kills you stated,a factor of time for insurance, and dealing with other issues (that would have been delt with earlier had we started on time) I belive we stated at the most effect time for our raid.  That was one hour AFTER our scheduled start (I actually belive it was a bit later after factoring all the re-pop concerns .. but hell .. I toss ya a bone).<br>
<br>
I would have had no issues with starting later.  But don't come on this board and say you made a good faith effort.  It was your actions that prohibited a reasonable compromise.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
Your posted screenshot proves exactly how you handled the situation all the way through our tells. I tried to explain to you very calmly what was the reason for our delayed raid and that it would indeed be very close to yours but I think it would work out. All you did was use caps and tell me how you would get us banned from everything on the board and on the server. Even your own screenshot shows your methods of negotiation, by threatening with ruining our fear raid the day after.<br>
------<br>
<br>
You don't negotiate by starting off in the wrong (6 hour start post), make no concessions, state you don't agree to the rules, and then expect someone to be gracious enough to push their time out.  The fact is you posted for 3PM EST, you started then.  How can you state that anyone impacted your raid?  You mentioned the Koreans .. the only thing that I see that could have happened is they scheduled theirs to fairly let you start at 3PM EST.  Don't blame others for your mistakes.<br>
<br>
Hrm.. let me put it a different &quot;Symbolic&quot; way for you .. Simple minds need simple examples:  You (Lanos) can not cut in line, between two folks (Koreans and I) at a grocery store, because your boss says if your late you will be fired, say 'oops .. forgot an item', then turn to the person in front of you (who is in a rush as well ) and ask thatt person (Me) to go get it for you.  That person (Me), who sees that your only out for yourself, is going to tell you to get it yourself and get in the back at the end of the line.  Not a perfect example, but one that will do if you sit and think about it for a minute.<br>
<br>
Negotiation takes the effort of both parties.  You bash Saphdia, yet she has negotiated and compromised her FG raids with both Harpers and Guardian Revelation.  No issues, no rants, just plain being fair.  Guardian Revelation offered our scheduled FG raid as part of it.  Note that please, Lanos.  <br>
<br>
You don't ask for compromise without being respectful and willing to compromise and give of yourself.  You will always lose.  You may have gotten the FG's and we had to delay ours because of it .. but your colors show here, and that makes you the loser.<br>
<br>

Quote krunnch: &lt;not repeating it&gt;<br>

<br>
No offense to Krunnch, but Krunnch is not the Rules.  If Krunnch did this, I would be here ripping Krunnch.  If Krunnch said the same things as you, I would be here ripping Krunnch.  Hell, if Krunnch did this to you, I would have been agreeing with you.<br>
<br>
Again, no offense to Krunnch, I don't care what Krunnch says .. The Rules are the Rules.<br>

No, I am flaming you for the following:<br>

1) Posting against the 8 Hour &gt;&gt; RULE &lt;&lt;<br>
2) Blaming it on the Koreans<br>
3) Used TZ as an issue<br>

5) Stating you negotiated .. I stated above why that is not negotiation.<br>
6) Continued your raid<br>

You are WAY out of line trying to bring AoW into this.<br>
<br>
What happened wiht AoW and ET on the fear situation is the fault of ET.<br>
<br>
Raids posted first have the right to do their raid.<br>
<br>
You cannot post after someone elses raid for a time that conflicts and expect the first party to adjust to you.<br>
<br>
Even as s show of good faith AoW even contacted YOUR raid leader and let him/her know what was going on and was told it was ok.<br>
<br>
<br>
GET OFF AoWs BACK<br>
<br>
Do not try to use them as an excuse to continue dispecable acts of thoughtlessness.<br>

<br>
You cant pick and choose which rules you follow. Rules state it's 8 hours between raids...so its 8 hours. Which part of that is hard to understand?<br>
<br>
Your main argument is that its a close to 6 hour repop. Whats your point here? Old style planes are 12-14 hour repop, but done daily..are you going to start farming them after 12 hours and hope they are respawned for the next raid? Maybe use the famous &quot;you'll only have to wait an hour or two&quot; excuse?<br>
<br>
If you don't think the FG's should be 8 hours, then ask for it to be changed..but you do that first, not ignore the rules then try to reason afterwards...people will be quick to jump on you then (as you may have noticed)<br>
<br>
One thing I havent heard, was the raid afterwards missing FG's as they started? If not its a moot point.<br>

Actually I did answer it .. We dealyed our raid and staged going in to make sure that all the FG's had repopped.  Lanos does not see the fact of this being a delay to us, and finds it acceptable.<br>

I posted that I would do them that day BEFORE 3 pm cause I had beliefs this was the deadline. Meredette went to the board and misunderstod the post by not reading it exactly and just looked at the 3 pm. Of course it was probably bad writing by me. Problem with meredette's raid was that they did not clear it all the way through so our intent with the FG raid(To check for Ragefire) we couldnt even have done earlier.<br>
<br>
Like I said it was cutting it very close but with little to almost no problems for the next raid. Since crusher I think who was posted as leader was not on at the time we started raid I would make sure we did it as fast as we could and tell him afterwards that I think to get a normal spawn all the way through he should start killing them maybe 15 min past the sheduled time. From what I could read on your post you were meeting at the posted time and buffing and such would taket he raid atleast 30 min above posted time before you did your slaying which would make sure there was no issue all the way through.<br>
<br>
Like I said the rules doesnt always make it easy on people in other time zones. I would love to just be able to wait till someone cleared the FGs for me and just have them send me a tell wether or not Ragefire was up, but I dont have that luxery.<br>
<br>
The FGs are in sense just an annoying factor in between what I was seeking. We half solved it by moving down a monk alt with a fungi tunic to stay in the lair. Then we could just log in with him to check if anything had spawned.<br>
<br>
But then again comes the other problem with the FG raids. Since they are in the middle of the night about 90% of the time I will have to make sure I can kill the FGs early enough that day to not interfer with the raid after. If we mess up the Ragefire Raid we might even put the next raid in problems if respawn occur and we have to kill some of it. Also the reason of why I wanted to post a time period of 8 hours to make sure that none booked raids that we could interfer with. <br>
<br>
You could say when I know ragefire spawns I could set up the raid for the day after, but we all know that if ragefire is up its pretty much known all over the server and the chance of him living the night over is slim to nothing. Since he is FFA there would be nothing we can do about it.<br>
<br>
I could of course contact the raid leader and hear if he would be okay with us maybe interfering with his FG raid. But by your own actions the chance of anyone allowing this is pretty much highly unlikely.<br>
<br>
Since ragefire is a random spawn between 24 to 72 hours I think it is. The chance of me booking some FG raids are almost impossible since I would have to block out 3 whole days, which I will just get yelled at for doing. Just look at Zesty response to the fact we booked just 2 raids to cover a 16 hours spawn period.<br>
<br>
<br>
You all say why do you care so much about the ragefire..its just another epic. That is very true but its also an important peice of higher lvl raiding and anyone saying different I will not believe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It cuts down huge amount of down time and makes the raid more fun for everyone. With often very little time to actually get something done at evenings this is like a present sent from the gods.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is due to the random spawn very random who gets. Often the people that have FGs will send a tell to someone that will then get it. I would like to atleast be left with the chance that he should spawn at our time the chance to take him out. The reservation on FGs is what makes this hard if you have to leave a 8 hours spawn hole. Often it can be done, but sometimes it will get very close.<br>
<br>
<br>
If I cant be cut a loudsy 15 to 30 min then what should I expect for co-operation. Everytime any raid cut just 30 min into any of our raids should I then come here screaming?<br>
<br>
I cant cause all I would get told is that I am the person with the problem and that it was my job to not post raids so close to the raid before starttime. But since 13 out of the 14 possible plane raids all have american start times what are my options? To never raid or keep ranting Verant for refusing to put up a european server?<br>
<br>
All I ever asked for was a little understanding and maybe help in trying to get this system to work for us aswell. In return I get flamed out of the board of breaking the rules that people have voted in as if that was going to make it fair for everyone. Cause of 15 maybe 30 min of spawn time that probably would have been used for buffing anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
I feel like the one black guy voting against 49 white, about weather or not black people should have the right to use the only bench in the park.<br>
<br>
My chance of winning that vote is about as big as the chance I ever have to change any rules on the brell board. But that doesnt mean they are fair and working perfectly for me or my guild.<br>

Ask yourself, do you want to change our system so that the europeans have the same chance to schedule raids as the North americans do? <br>
<br>
Why should we adjust our system for such a small group of people? <br>
<br>
Aren't we being uber as a server for not giving the smaller minority a fairer chance and just doing whatever we please without regard for them, making them fend for themselves.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we do accomidate them but it should give you the oppertunity to see yourself as a member of an uber population. And how you feel about those smaller then you.<br>
