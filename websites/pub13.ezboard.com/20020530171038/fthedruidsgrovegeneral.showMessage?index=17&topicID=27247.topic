Thanks for stopping by.<br>
<br>
I disagree with your assessment of the value of a petition.  The amount of work and contribution of the community to arrive at the Druid petition was phenominal.  Hundreds of ideas were not included simply to bring Verant's attention what we felt were the MOST important aspects.  What could be better than to have a community band together in a constructive tone and help you weed through all chaff by using the form of a petition?<br>
<br>
I'll conceed that there are those that signed that didn't agree in whole to the petition, but that's what community is about: compromise and debate.  If your concerned with people agreeing with all bullet items simply to sign an petition, implement something like the bug parade at the Java Development Connection and have people vote on specific features, bugs, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/index.jshtml">developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/index.jshtml</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
And last but not least, I feel it's illogical to say a petition is not the right communication mechanism because you might have to respond unfavorably .  I'd be overjoyed that people took the effort for such an endevour and instead of telling them they did it wrong by creating a petition, I'd treat them with the courtesy of a well written, appreciative,  and thoughtfull reply explaining any differences of opinion.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

It seemed many people who /agreed were agreeing with the discontent in hopes that VI would reconsider the &quot;druids are the most perfectly balanced class&quot; stance expressed many times for the past several expansions/balancings. Many people's comments in the /agrees were simply &quot;Something has to be done&quot;. I think nothing else could have gotten this point across more effectively. <br>
<br>
But that may be the point. The petition was too effective. The reason VI have people like Absor is to act as an intermediary between designer and public... to protect the designer's &quot;fragile little minds&quot; (*in Cartman's voice*) from the often harsh opinions of the public, and to bolster public relations. Absor cannot do his job nor feel accomplished unless all requests are routed through the dev corner.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are in our world now&quot; says it all, I think. It is their world and their vision. Changes in the game (such as designing encounters that diverge from the typical tank/healer paradigm) could possibly make the petition's suggestions moot. I can't know what VI is thinking collectively until the next balancing/expansion. I'd just like to know what the vision is, and how 58+ druids fit into it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucclothar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ccLothar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/30/02 9:45:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27247.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:not dirrected at us</span><hr size=1> Good to hear Alan.  <br>

As for ideas, I disagree with Alan. How can making suggestions stunt the development of good ideas?

<br>
I would guess this depends on how many letters they get.  At some point it would simply not be feasible to sent a personal acknowledgement to everyone who writes in.  <br>
<br>
This is a mechanism for feedback on the game, not personal validation.<br>
<br>
As for businesses' ignoring the plight over 1 over the plight of many, I can guarantee you that most businesses will take the single complaint of a well-spoken customer over the aggressive representation of a person or small group of persons who claim they reperesent a large group of people.  It comes across as a threat and sabre-rattling.  And just is a very ineffective way of communicating.<br>
<br>
Finally, did anyone miss the part where inevitably petitions have both good ideas and bad ideas.  Every class petition I have ever seen in EQ has had multiple bad ideas in it, plus several that were less than key.<br>
<br>
You simply can not effectively distinguish key issues from peripheral issues when you lump them all together.<br>
<br>
I have always disdained class petitions in EQ.  If people believe they have to result to hardline, aggressive tactics to get developers to change a game, then perhaps it is time to find another game.<br>
<br>
Finally, I would bet that If someone wrote up a Quiz based on the druid petition that 50% of the people who signed it would fail the quiz.<br>

The petition was not aggressive in wording or tone. <br>

Again, not much choice there. I'd like to sit down with Jahaar to talk about issues, but that's what fan faires are for -- if you can get a question or comments in. Other times I had met these guys, there was no way in hell I was compromising my job to foreground a player issue. :D <br>

Personally, i didnt agree with parts of the petition.  His scenario where people gave signatures even though they werent in full support, because all they could do was agree or disagree, definitely represented my signature.  I definitely feel we need healing upgrades, i think its silly for them not to realize this.  I dont think we need a new Dot, it was silly for us to ask for that.  Regardless, i supported it.  So i agree, the petition as a whole isnt representative of the community's thoughts.<br>
<br>
Its harsh when people put so much time and effort towards something, and the response is blunt in stating that the means of which you went about it was wrong.  I dont like the 'send in to the Dev' idea either because i think good ideas get lost amongst all the bad ones.  I can see them getting tons of emails with ideas, and just shuffling through them without really reading or taking everything too seriously.  A daily dose of mass emails asking for changes has to get old after a while regardless of what they say.  A great example of how silly what they choose to respond to was that response they recently posted from an email sent in by i think a lvl 30's wizard who was complaining Wizards cant do damage.  That doesnt give me too much confidence in what Verant chooses to take seriously.<br>
<br>
Anyways, i think the response in a nutshell is to send in ideas to the Dev board, and thats our best bet.  Theres really nothing to argue about.  I dont have faith in the seriousness they claim to take everything sent in so i dont think its worth wasting my time.  Verant may be teddy bears, but theyre teddy bears with big ego's in regards to what they think is best for the game.  With that mentality i dont think they take most of whats sent in too seriously.  <br>
<br>
Oh well, the petition made some great points, and i would have loved to hear them directly respond to how they've given evrybody SOW-like, and traveling abilities, which in the past were perks for playing a druid, without compensating druids for that loss.  Regardless, they'll probably choose to respond to an email sent in by a lvl 30 Druid complaining he has a hard time getting places.  You guys at Verant dont give players too much confidence with some of the stuff you do :/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=27247.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=27247.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27247.topic&index=30><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~msippel/thedruidsgrove/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=27247.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=27247.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27247.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27247.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
