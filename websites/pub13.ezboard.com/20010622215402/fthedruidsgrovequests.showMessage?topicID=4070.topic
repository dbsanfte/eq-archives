<br>
<br>
<><br>
<br>
<><br>
<br>
<><br>
<br>
<><br>
<br>
<><br>
<br>
<br>
ok.  here we go.  first a complete step by step.<br>
<br>
first, talk to loremaster borannin in the thurgadin library.  say "what brewing?" (continued from the 3rd shawl).<br>
<br>
You say, "What is brewing?"<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh yes good to see you again Clairan. I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil on one of our best. He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and had not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?"<br>
<br>
You say "I will accept this mission."<br>
<br>
Loremaster Borannin says "The council will be pleased to hear of your acceptance, Clairan. Scour the region surrounding the city of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell protect you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
now head to eastern wastes and the kael ramp.  Tanik is a triggered spawn.  the way to trigger him is to run up and down the kael ramp.  (worked best for me when i ran zig zag).  he spawns down towards the bottom of the ramp and is laying on the ground.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, "hail Tanik Greskil"<br>
Tanik Greskil says "Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help."<br>
<br>
You say, "i will help"<br>
Tanik Greskil says "Quickly, give me a vial of Veluim Vapors so I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from our clerics."<br>
<br>
You say, "what velium vapors"<br>
Tanik Greskil says "Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now outlander, you're my only hope."<br>
<br>
<br>
so now you have to run back to thurgadin.  Frundle can be found in one of the three buildings across from the paladin guild (near the library).  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You say, "what velium vapors?"<br>
Frundle Frenkler says "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret."<br>
<br>
You say, "what velium vial?"<br>
Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet."<br>
<br>
<br>
she will give you a 4 slot purifier.  it is a container, so you will need an open inventory slot.<br>
<br>
now you need to collect your ingedients.  go to CC.  everything you need is there.  hunt the miners up top for the small pieces and small bricks of velium.  then drop (make sure you have lev!) down to the bottom, run through the dorf town, and into the hall with the velium crawlers, spiderlings, and webmasters.  the spiderlings die in one nuke (688).  the crawlers die in one nuke and one ES dot (688+300=around 1k HP).  webmasters are tougher and i avoided them.  in about an hour, i had a stack of these and gated out.<br>
<br>
head back to thurgadin.  go in the bank.  the vendor on the very left sells crystal shards and HQ firing sheets.  buy 2 crystal shards and 1 HQ firing sheet.<br>
<br>
go click on the pottery wheel in the bank.  put the items in like this:<br>
<br>
crystalline silk<br>
crystalline silk<br>
crystalline silk<br>
glass shard<br>
glass shard<br>
small brick of velium<br>
<br>
do not stack the silks.  also, even though all other pottery i've done always requires a water flask, do not use one.  i tried and it didn't combine. so NO WATER FLASK!  i'm around 100 in pottery and it was not trivial.<br>
<br>
you will get an unfired velious vial.<br>
<br>
right next to the pottery wheel is the kiln.  combine the vial you just made with a high quality firing sheet.  this will produce a velious vial.  it was trivial at 100.<br>
<br>
<br>
now, open that purifier box that you got and put in the vial, and 2 small pieces of velium.  make sure they are not stacked.<br>
<br>
small piece of velium<br>
small piece of velium<br>
velious vial<br>
<br>
hit combine and you will have a vial of velium vapors.  this looks like it can be used by characters as well.  it has one charge of "thurgadin gate" and apparently will gate you to thurgadin, although i didnt try.<br>
<br>
<br>
now run back to eastern wastes and find tanik again.  give him the vial of velium vapors and he will thank you and then poof, leaving you a note to deliver to loremaster borannin.  go back to thurgadin and turn your woven shawl along with the note to loremaster borannin and you will get faction and your shawl will be updated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://clairan.50megs.com/shawl.jpg><br>
<br>
:)  good luck<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  WORDS OF WARNING!  when trying to make tanik pop, there is a chance that instead of tanik, you will trigger the kromriff death squad.  this is a group of very nasty giants that have high MR (even after my group debuffed him, i couldn't land a snare).  they also run at nearly sow speed.  if anyone has ever fought warden bruke in EW, it's like having a handful of him all spawning on you at once, except they have more HP and see through invis.  our group (ranging from mid 40s to 50s) had trouble killing one.  we finally succeeded and got a nice large class only woven vest (18 ac, 10 str and some other attributes).  my friend had between 8-10 spawn on her at once.  she got a message of "you have been giant ambushed" and they killed her in seconds.  i took a screenshot of the dead one we killed if you need proof...but i don't lie.  so be careful<br>
<br>
also, the quest once again stop at this point.  figures.  now we wait another 2 months for them to add the 5th part.  wow, by Christmas this shawl will be worth wearing!<br>

anyways, some more info.  <br>
<br>
All the velium stuff and the silk also drops from the mobs at the entrance to Velks.<br>
<br>
I got Tanik (and also the Giant Goon squad) to spawn at neg6800 2920.  So, the triggering trap is probably like those in DN, ie it moves arround.<br>

so i went to CC.  6 people in zone.  either hunting named orcs or the spider queen.  spiders have less hp, hit (and usually miss) for a lot less, and drop silks with much greater frequency.  <br>

Invis, levitate.<br>
<br>
He appeared not far from bottom but out of reach of guardsmen. A senetence appeared that said something like:<br>
&quot;a snow thing pop and you see a dwarve emerge..;&quot;<br>
<br>
About the POTION;<br>
<br>
Its a gate to Thurgadin, put you at entrance in the middle of the entrance bridge (right where the dwarves can hit you with their crossbows if you are KoS)<br>
<br>
If you do the shawl quest, gather 2 times the components, make one potion, ask a second purifier. When you find Tanik, give your potion, combine the new one and gate back to Thurg also :)<br>
<br>
I think a lot of melee character will and should do that part of the quest as its a very cheap and easy gate potion to have.<br>
<br>
The casting time of the potion is around the casting time of a group gate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubraidfreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>braidfreak</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/15/01 5:23:16 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/braidfreak/cat1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Complete 4th shawl quest spoiler!  </span><hr size=1> i had to go up and down the ramp about 8 times before he popped. <p>check out simplekill...a band that's about to explode and squash queer bands like korn

the vial of velium vapor is also lore, so you can't carry a bunch of these around with you...although that would kick booty.  you could "technically" carry two with you.  one vial of velium vapor...and then also carry the 4 slot purifier box with the nigredients in it...so when you use the vial, you can hit combine and have another one. <p>check out simplekill...a band that's about to explode and squash queer bands like korn

<br>
The Death Squad is random.  First time we ran the ramp, the squad appeared.  Only two giants though.  Second time, Tanik spawned.  Third time Tanik spawned again and my buddy and I both got the quest finished.<br>
<br>
Our approach was to have my friends mule, the barbarian warrior used for the other broodmother quest, to run the ramp.  She was only dubious to the giants so when the squad spawned they ignored her and I was far enough away not to aggro them.  They despawn pretty quick.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<br>
1) to make the velium vial just follow the recipe give to you...you do NOT need a vial sketch to make the vial.  Both making it and firing it were trivial to me at 135... but that didn't stop me from failing once...GRRRRR<br>
<br>
2)Bricks of velium often for sale on the vendors in Thurgadin bank...take a peek<br>
<br>
3)The added Cold resist when I am already up at 200 surely trumps the extra 1 wis on the cords (I am on RZ...resists are key), so this is now my primary wis shoulder<br>
<br>
4)Yes the gate potion is usable by PC's.  I did it.<br>
<br>
5)I suggest camping Crystal Cavers for all velium pieces and bricks and the silks.  2 of you at the miners and spiders there will have plenty in a heartbeat.  Or just root dot...if you have ES vams goes really fast.<br>
<br>
6) No there is definitely not a 5th quest yet.  Grrrr....<br>
<br>
7) The Dwarf can spawn anywhere around Kael, just run around the area.  I saw a message like &quot;you knock over a pile of snow and uncover a Coldain!&quot; and there he was laying there actually on the ramp.  Also saw him just south near the ulthork/walrus farm.<br>
<br>
8) Just added this one: DO NOT HAND IN YOUR SEAL.  Don't need to, just the note from the dwarf and your woven prayer shawl.<br>
<br>
9) I have never seen a &quot;Death Squad&quot;. <p>Neek Neekerbeekers<BR>

suckers. way to much work.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
uh...it took me all of two hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
but i guess if you'd rather do the freeport muffin quest 400 times in an hour, that's your shoice.  personally, i like quests that are actually a challenge, and this one isn;t really all that difficult...mean, same night of the patch and i post a complete spoiler.  how is that way too much work?  even if you've never worked on pottery, you can get from 1-85 in about 30 min without ever leaving thurgadin for less than 10pp.   <p>check out simplekill...a band that's about to explode and squash queer bands like korn

<br>
Any truth to this?<br>

<br>

<br>

After you get the +4 shawl, is there any indication of a continuation?<br>
