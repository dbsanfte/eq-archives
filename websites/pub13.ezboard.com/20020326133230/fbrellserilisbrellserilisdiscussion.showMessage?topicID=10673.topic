Everyone please read this.</span><hr size=1> I am posting this here and in the rant site. This is my last effort to return some equipment that was stolen by a former guild member (that I kicked out) for transfer stealing. I got the equipment back...just need help locating the person who it was stolen from. I know this is will be hard to do, but I have to try. Listen to my story and see if it sounds familiar to you. Please E-mail me at GinaMT73@aol.com if you can help me find this person.<br>
<br>
About two months or so ago, there was this guy in my guild who asked in guild chat what would happen to him if he were to steal a transfer. I told him that I would remove him from my guild if he did that and I found out about it. He said that someone gave him a bag full of bard stuff and asked him to transfer it for him. The next thing I know, he logged off. I ran really quick to the zone that he was in, looking for a newbie bard to find out what happened. I found the bard and told him that I thought he equipment was getting stolen. I invited him into my guild and told him I would help him get it back. Well, Gilthanin and I got this guy banned from EQ for 7 days for transfer stealing. When this guy got back from being banned, I tracked him down. He joined a new guild, and with the help of Tengis, I got all the stolen equipment back. Well, this is my problem...the bard who got this stuff stolen from him, doesn't play anymore. I don't know the name of his main. I only know that he had (at the time) a 41st level Wizard. If you know who this happened to or can help me return this stuff to it's rightful owner, please e-mail me. I don't want to hang on to this stuff forever. To claim this equipment, I will need the following...<br>
<br>
1) the name of the bard<br>
2) the name of the wizard<br>
3) a description of the items that were stolen.<br>
<br>
I tried going through a GM to return the stuff, since I had the guy's bard's name. The GM said to me...and I quote...&quot;Sorry, that's not my problem. I'm too busy to worry about this stuff.&quot; I know the GMs are busy and I guess it's not really their problem since the person who stole the equipment was punished (at least in their eyes). Anyways...I know the guy has a mid-to-higher level wizard, at least higher than 41. I will hang on to the equipment a bit longer. I just really want to return it to it's rightful owner. So, if you can help, please do.<br>
<br>
I will appreciate any and all help in returning this equipment.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Everyone please read this.</span><hr size=1> Well...it was Oribi that told me she was too busy to worry about such things. I doubt she'd try to help now. I got the items back about a week after the guy who stole it came back from being suspended. So, I petitioned a GM to tell them about getting the stuff back. I told them that I had the name of the guy's bard. Oribi said she wouldn't give me the name of one character's alt, which is completely understandable. I then asked if I could give her or another GM the bag and they could retrun it to him. She wouldn't respond to me. As far as they were concerned, the matter had been settled after the theif got suspended. It's really impossible for me to find this guy. He had a 41st level wizard at the time. Most wizards stay anon or roleplay. I asked a number of wizards that I could find, with no luck. <br>
<br>
It's not like the items are anything really great. It's just that point of the matter. The guy who got this stuff stolen told me, while he was playing his bard, that he got the Lambent pieces himself, without anyone else's help. That's not exactly easy to do alone at level 41. I just want him to have it back. So this is the only idea I have left in finding this guy. Thanks for your help though.<br>

Everyone please read this.</span><hr size=1> Yea thats extremely nice. I had Sebilis Scale items given to me by a level 60 Necromancer when I was an 18 Shadow Knight. His name was something that had to do with gouls and ghosts &amp; stuff like that, but spelled like he sounded it out (of course because he couldn't get the original spelling as a name). I think he retired a while ago and he gave me a boat load of shits and some punk stole it in a transfer to one of my other characters. I wish someone in his guild would have done that for me. <p>------------------------

Then when I found out that he joined a new guild, I talked with higher level people in his guild. That's when I finally convinced him to give it all back. But getting it all back, doesn't do anything, unless I can actually return it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the compliments though. I don't like people who try to give my guild a black eye by doing stuff like that.<br>
