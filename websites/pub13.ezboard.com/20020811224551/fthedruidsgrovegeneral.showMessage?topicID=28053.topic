My first reaction to your post was incredulity at the arrogance it takes to imply that people need to be taught how to play the game. I realized, however, that this is my own subjective opinion, and that high end guilds often are established enough to expect a certain level of play. <br><br>Shouldn't that come from grouping with and raiding with that guild, to see if the person is worthwhile? If they're not willing to invest the time in bringing fresh blood into the guild, then why should they reap the benefits of Ye Olde Guild School? It's laziness. Vive bourgeoise. <br><br>Plus, I tend to think anyone who would go &quot;oooh! I wanna be in X_Guild, just because they're powerful! I wanna go to guild school so maybe I can be good enough to join them!&quot; smacks of patheticness. Yep, I'm getting too old. <br><br>The reason I say this is not to be harsh--hey, if it works, all power to you--but to demonstrate the reaction of a number of people. This has the potential of making it difficult for you to recruit people for the Guild School. Getting it off the ground--AND having enough members to make it something worthwhile (oh, look, we have..one enchanter in the guild and he's on vacation...hmm...so much for Raid_Lesson_04)--is going to be a major challenge for you. Be prepared for a negative backlash from people.<br><br>2. I've dealt with plenty of idiot players in my time. It's part and parcel of the game. Many can be taught. Many are wonderful *people*, and have become good friends, even if they occasionally annoy me with their inability to learn more efficient play styles.  Teaching them, and being patient with them, and applauding as they DO get better--that's a reward. <br><br>What does your guild school do if someone is a slow learner? It's not as if being intelligent is a requirement for leveling. What if they've shown steady improvement, but suddenly hit 50 and have to leave the guild?<br><br>Not everyone picks up &quot;how to play EQ&quot; in a week and a half. I know people who take months. That doesn't mean they don't play at a more-than-accepted level of play now..but whew, if you'd see 'em a while back..<br><br>That's a problem. If you assume that everyone between a certain level range has a fixed learning curve, and you kick 'em out at a predetermined level, you're going to screw yourself. That's why the &quot;keep 'em til 59&quot; is such a good suggestion. I heartily agree.<br><br>3. More on the level range: For normal xp grouping, you have to realize, not only can you throw together a 6-of-any-class group, but that you don't have to be a great player to succeed. What you seem to be looking for is a way to train people for raids, epic encounters, and so on. For that reason, getting people as early as level 30 is futile. It doesn't matter how much your cleric learns at 30, when they scribe Complete Heal and Celestial Healing, life changes. A druid that's ill-equipped with Greater Healing at level 45 isn't going to have an idea of his role as a bridge healer post-level 51. What would he learn? <br><br>I feel that if you want it to work, grab people when they can start experiencing these encounters, and use it as an education program based upon skills they possess. 46-59 is the best range from which to do it. <br><br>That's the range where a lot of people leave guilds anyway, in search of different content. Therefore, you won't be infringing on anyone, and when a person says &quot;well, now I can raid..and I'd really love to get in An_Uber_Guild_01&quot;, they would have somewhere they could go--Guild School. <br><br>Starting the levels earlier just wouldn't accomplish much.<br><br>Your skill ranges (level 1, 2, 3) do not overlap as the classes progress in power. To continue the cleric example, a cleric at 39 has Complete Heal. They will learn far, far more by healing a level 45 tank repeatedly than a level 31 one, I feel--plus, the difference in aggro, taunt, etc..different.<br><br>If you’re tuning people for the high end--then tune people after they’ve reached raid level. If you’re looking to teach people how to play the game, then starting at level 30 means you’re going to waste a lot of very teachable levels. Decide what you want to do with it. <br><br>4. Giving people quests to develop their skills..I'm really curious what quest you could give me, for example, that would develop my skills. That's not sarcasm; I'm being straightforward here, because I'm not sure what you mean. <br><br>5. There can’t be only one grand master per class, ever. People quit EQ. It’s a fact, for a variety of reasons. <br><br>6. You mention this: <br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> would you see the most powerful person of your chosen profession being someone who has not obtained that for which is the defining stature of their class?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Or, maybe, they're smart enough to realize that for many classes there's no need to waste time on an epic time sink. An epic doesn't make someone &quot;the most powerful person of a chosen profession&quot;, not to mention, they couldn't be the most powerful person if multiple people have epics anyway. They'd just be &quot;shared power people&quot;. *grin*<br><br>Epics require time and, mostly, lotsa people. Neither is indicative of any great player skill to click up and loot an epic piece, or to accompany 60 other people on a PoA raid and win a /random.  I would hazard a guess that most guilds know this. :)<br><br>Though I disagree with certain principles behind it, I salute your initiative and original thinking.<br><br><br> <p><table width=460><tr><td align=right><img src=http://www.greendragoons.com/hrettsig.gif></td><td align=left><p><b>E'ci:</b><font size=0><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=85371" target="_blank">Hrendra An'ei</a> • 46 Erudite Shadow Knight<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42837" target="_blank">Hraina Tempest</a> • 37 Half-elf Druid<br> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220798" target="_blank">Hrett Mai'ru</a> • 35 Dark Elf Magician <br>Hraven Fiuri • 31 High Elf Cleric </font><p><b>Kane Bayle:</b><font size=0><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280563" target="_blank">Nari Hibiku</a> • 24 Human Monk</td><td align=left><img src=http://www.greendragoons.com/hraibluesig.gif></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubigemnoseandhow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bigemnose andhow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333399>(8/2/02 5:09:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28053.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something very different looms in the air!</span><hr size=1> Wow.  I love it.  Finally somebody is thinking!<br><br>Your ideas are great... and help a lot.  When I started this discussion, everything was up in the air, but I had to put something on paper to get the ball rolling.  So I did.  And, I got feedback which caused me to change some of the things.  And again... and again... and again.  This is going to be a long process of revisions before it becomes something that will please most of the people.  The mission will never please all of the people, but that is ok.<br><br>I totally agree with you on the 46 to 59 part.  I keep struggling with getting rid of the 30 to 45 group of people because I do not want to look like a jerk that comes along and takes people from their happy guilds at level 46.  That is why I wanted to include people from level 30 up.  But, the more I think about it, the more I believe that the guild school should concentrate only on levels 46 to 59.  I will give this a great deal more thought before I decide though.<br><br>Also, you showed a lot of anger towards the idea of creating uber guild ready players.  I can understand this because I have some what familar beliefs.  That being said, I wanted to point out that guild school is not about creating mindless players.  There will be those that graduate from guild school and do not go on to &quot;uber&quot; guilds.  Not because they are not good enough, but because they do not choose to play in an &quot;uber&quot; way.  There is nothing wrong with playing in a family style guild, and I would like to think that when people graduate from guild school, they would have the opportunity to choose whether their information be submitted to an &quot;uber&quot; guild or a &quot;family&quot; guild.  Game play style is always the players choice.  The guild school is just there to help the players develop their skills to function in a guild more effectively.  There would never be any time that an officer would tell a member of guild school how to live their life or anything like that.  The officers would simply instruct the members of guild school on how to setup for certain types of raids, how to react in a situation gone wrong, and so on.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubuzweaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>buzweaver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid of The Grove</span><br>  Posts: 508<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 11:35:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28053.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.100megsfree.com/ktcrhp/druid.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something very different looms in the air!</span><hr size=1> I don't think its all about the End Game.  <p><center><b>BuzzFelinous (13 Bard)<br>BuzzVar(30 Shaman)<br>BuzzSilverThor (60 Hierophant )<p></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucronuus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cronuus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333399>(8/4/02 7:57:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28053.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mm-tn01.sac2.fastsearch.net/thumbnail?cmd=key&param=1402775 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something very different looms in the air!</span><hr size=1> Hehe, leave at level 50 to join an uber guild, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Cronuus Cloudgatherer</b><br><u>Level 60 Hierophant </u><br><b>¤Proud member of <i>Exiled Alliance</i>¤</b><br>Ayonae Ro server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorrun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Venerable Hierophant<br><center>of The Grove</center></span><br>  Posts: 1887<br> <font color=#333399>(8/5/02 12:05:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28053.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something very different looms in the air!</span><hr size=1> I think this idea is has potential but is incredibly arrogant... <br><br>This is similar to the guides on EBAY about how to play a class... very little about EQ from 1-53 (my current level) has been rocket science so what do you hope to teach anyone by 50 that they wont learn on thier own?
