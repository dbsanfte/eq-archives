I felt her.<br>
<br>
Shimmering, blackness upon blackness, a frosted shade manifested and quivering in the darkness.  I could feel her arms of arctic ivory, soft and numbing wrapped around me, her breath a wave of ice sliding along the nape of my neck.  Glacial.<br>
<br>
&quot;My son.  My one true believer.  My task I set before you, and you obey.  Such is my will, and such is your faith.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her wintery words blew gales of her will though my heart.  I heard her command: I obeyed.  Calling forth the shadows about me, I set forth immediately to Castle Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
Castle Mistmoore in the autumn.  I stood before the gates of Mayong's Bastion, the fallen leaves spinning in the unquiet air.  He was not home, and I was glad of this: I had no business with him.  Through the gates my shadow passed, silent and unnoticed by his guard.  I passed his servants, his courtiers, all the while drawn to the palpable aura of the one I was sent to find.  I could taste him in the damp air of the granite castle, his spirit pulsating an angry red in the darkness: a light only I can see, and I saw it through the stone walls and tapestries of castle.  I was drawn to him.<br>
<br>
An empty corridor with no outlets, no doors.  &quot;How subtle,&quot; I smirked to myself underneath my shroud of shadows.  I felt the one marked by the Walker behind the wall before me, and I prepared myself to meet him.  The dead rose for me silently, scattered chips of bone upon hard stone.  I stepped through the wall, and he was there.  He was trollish in his features, giant plates of steel strapped to his grotesque form were his armour.  He was a Knight of Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
<br>
&quot;Xicotl,&quot; I whispered quietly.  &quot;You have been called home: you must return forthwith, as is your duty.  And I am the road you must take.&quot;  He raised his blade above his head, brought it down upon me viciously.  A skeletal hand stopped the blade with its palm inches away from my shoulder, and my crimson hand reached out to touch Xicotl's chest.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go home.&quot;<br>
 <br>
A flash of light: he flew backwards to strike the wall with a clatter of metal.  He did not rise again.  My work was done.  My work was not as stealthy as I was hoping it to be, and I turned to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;You kill my private guard, and do not choose to acknowledge my presence?  I should be insulted.&quot;<br>
<br>
A voice in the darkness, soft and feminine, spoke to me amid  soft splashes of water.  I turned around to see her there before me, alone and nude in her bathing pool.  Her pallid back was to me, her head half-turned to face me, a mane of snowy hair dripping beads of water in the dim lighting.  She was beautiful far beyond any mortal comprehension.  She exuded beauty in palpable waves: wave after wave of attraction.  Tidal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I came to perform the wishes of my master, and my work is finished.  I mean Lord Mistmoore no ill-will.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not Lord Mistmoore you have insulted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I am Lasna Cheroon.&quot;<br>
<br>
She rose up from the waters of her bath, firelight from the candles behind her causing the water to fall from her like a cloak of diamonds.  The soft music of water in the silence as she rose up before me.  I held my breath as she turned to face me, and averted my gaze from her as she reached to pick up a soft linen robe, which she lightly draped over her body.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have insulted me.  Xicotl was my servant, posted under my will to guard me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked down upon his wasted body, the skin once brown now white and drained of life completely.  She looked into my eyes, and I gazed back.  I was consumed by the cold fire burning there behind her lidded eyes, and she beckoned me to her with one hand upraised.  She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;You will do, D`Estain.  Now help me from my bath, please.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did as I was told.  She pressed her body against mine in the tranquil darkness of her bath, and her lips were incandescent upon my neck, an inferno setting my cloaked body alive in a holocaust of my own mortality.  My arms encompassed her, my crimson hand flaring hotly against the small of her back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, young one..,&quot; she whispered, her pale lips quivering lightly against my neck. &quot;You will do.&quot;<br>
<br>
     ---------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I stayed with Lasna for centuries, it seemed.  In fact it was only days.  Her love was cruel in its fierocity.  I was burned by her.  Upon the last night I stared into her furnace eyes, my heart set reeling by the light I felt there.  She bent her head to kiss my neck again, as was her wont, and as her lips found me I felt a surge of darkness cascade throughout the whole of of the castle, like mist over dark water: complete and blinding in its intensity.  Her head reared back, and she had changed.  Her eyes glared hot white light in the darkness of her room, sending the shadows fleeing from under her gaze.  Her white hair fluttered back with a wind I could not feel, a wind I knew was not there physically.  Her entire body blazed with light above me, and as she opened her lips to speak these words I saw glistening under her full lips the bone-white of two long fangs.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord Mayong has come home.  And I am his.&quot;<br>
<br>
She smiled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Go.  Now.&quot;<br>

Why I'm writing all these stories I have thought up for my character I dunno.  Maybe I'm just bored with EQ?<br>
