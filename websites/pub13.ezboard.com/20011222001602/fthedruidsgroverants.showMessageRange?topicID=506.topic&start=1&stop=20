<br>
the pure stupidiy and number of morons in Everquest seems to be growing daily. Take this for example last night, I just had dinged to 29, and went about and got my GG's, and my other spells...<br>
<br>
now, I'd been waiting quite a long time for these spells, and I planned to use some of the money I got with GG's towards GEB's... because I allready have 4k in the bank, and my items really cant be improved until level 45+ (Level 29 with Paw of Opolla.... LOL!) Anyawys, I did a GG to WC, and was making a run to WFP, to pick up some more travelers. I got there, and got my group together for the GG. My spells were a bit out of whack, because I had just got my new ones, and, unless grouping I dont keep SoW up, just Wolf Form...<br>
<br>
Now... I'm sitting there, with the group of 3 I'm GG'ing to BB, and a level 22 comes up to me... Heres how the dialogue goes...<br>
<br>
Him-Can I get a SoW?<br>
Me-A little busy, GGing at the moment. Sorry, but you can probaly find another druid in here.<br>
<br>
Now, I was typing while the GG went off, so I GG'ed, and then the messaging started up agani..<br>
<br>
Him-WTF<br>
Me-My Friend? What ales you?<br>
Him-Stuipd lazy ***** Druid<br>
Me-Now, why do you say that?<br>
Him-Its your job to SoW me.<br>
<br>
Now at this point I looked at my screen, and allthough the fury was building inside of me, a slight grin cracked my face.<br>
<br>
Me-Do you realize I dont OWE you ANYTHING? you didnt even saw Please, you just said an I Sow you. I dont have it memmed.<br>
Him-Wouldnt have taken more than 2 seconds to mem the spell<br>
Me-So I should have canceled my GG, sat down, memmed SOW, cast it on you so y ou could run away without saying thanks?<br>
Him-Ya.. I have a level 51 Druid and I accept I owe people SoW<br>
<br>
Now, I discovered he was a fraud.<br>
<br>
Me-LOL! If you were a 51 Druid you would know how to ask a Druid for SoW, becuase you would know how annoying it gets to get asked for SoW over and over again.<br>
Him-Whatever... You give Druids a Bad name<br>
Me-You know what? You give HUMANS a bad name... And no, not in the game.<br>
<br>
I personally liked that last remark, as he fell silent for a moment<br>
<br>
HIm-Whatever.. you druids are all stupid.<br>
Me-Whatever man, you have proved to be a moron and incompetent three times allready this evening, I hope you enjoy giving Mankind a bad name, keep up your hard work. Btw... Welcome to my ignore lislt<br>
<br>
/ignore<br>
<br>
You know.. just the brashness of him to EXPECT me to CANCEL my GG, Mem SoW, just to cast on him for no reason? LOL!<br>
<br>
I dont know wether I should be pissed or if I should laugh.<br>
<br>

And then I took him out and Pled him against the &quot;mighty emerald drakes&quot; LOL. My regular healing spell would bring him up all the way.. he was level 5 :-P<br>

I then proceeded to give him a Platnium Jasper Ring, which of course meant the world to him.<br>

Get your facts right, and stop lieing to the nice people here....<br>
<br>
1) Zoofy (my secondary) is level 40...not 22<br>
2) You were sitting there waiting for your friends to arrive....they were not there yet, and you were not in the middle of casting your tport.<br>
3) I asked you for a SoW yes....  You said, no, I don't have it memed...then, about 2 mins later, began casting your tport<br>
4) I said WTF...yes<br>
5) I called you a lazy druid....yes.. You are a lazy druid....deal with it.<br>
6) You told me that if you ever need help, you'll ask your guild....LOL....You guild is pathitic!  Like 5 people on, and none over level 45....LOL<br>
7) My druid is level 52....yes, I get tells like that all the time, but YOU never said that, as well as 1/2 the things you told me....and I ALWAYS sow anyone that needs it, de-meming spells and all<br>
8) Understand this retard:<br>
    What if clerics stopped rezzing?<br>
    What if druids stopped SoWing?<br>
    What if tanks stopped tanking?<br>
    What if rangers stopped dieing?<br>
    What if wizzies meleed?<br>
<br>
EQ works on a balance that everyone needs everyone else in order to work.  Now you said yourself that you can solo, so you have no need for tanks or wizzies or anything....  Well, answer this wise guy....  How are you going to get your planer armor?  How you gonna get Dragon Loot?  How are you gonna get anything in this world that cannot be soloed?  What, you gonna perma camp Pzjyn and Hadden and trade for it for the rest of your life? LOL....I hope so.<br>
<br>
Next time, remember that my level 40 warrior....not 22.....40....my end up in the same group as you one day (god fearing) and what if I remember what an ass you were huh?  You go pull Frenzy in guk or something, then automaticly expect me to taunt it off you....  Oh wait...I don't OWE YOU ANYTHING....which means I can sit there and let you die....because I can be just as big of an @#%$ as you.<br>

It is not that big of a deal to keep it memmed.<br>
<br>
And if you do not want to cast it or do not have the time, just go on and do not try to justify your actions. You will never win that argument.<br>
<br>
Same thing almost applies to teleports. When I got my brand new teleport spells, I was very proud of them and also thought they would be a nice money source!  I teleported for pp for a while to buy my spells but soon enough the attraction diminishes.  Accordingly, the higher you level, the more blase we become and casting SOW, a few buffs, or shipping someone off to Cobalt Scar just become routine.<br>
<br>
All classes have their own little problems... Cleric have rezzes, chanters have c2 issues, Shamies have buffs and the list goes on.  Just remember that non-casters REALLY like our buffs and abilities. And after all, playing without gate, unbuffed and sowless is NOT that fun. <br>

SoW please? You're asking someone to do you a favor. Taunt when we're fighting? *That* is your job, Mr. Warrior. The druid's job is probably to keep the mobs snared, and whatever else the party needs. Druids are not responsible for making sure that everyone has SoW on demand.<br>
<br>
To the druid with 4k and a Paw at 29: really though, how hard is this: duck, /book, mem, stand, cast, re-GG. You and your groupmates will still get there a lot faster than if you took the boat. Ya know, you'll probably have to mem sow once you get there, unless you're planning on drinking at the BB ring or something. (Not that there's anything wrong with drinking at the BB ring.)<br>

A SoC(i interchange with Gate indoors) will save your butt alot better than a SOW mem will.  And if you have both of those mem'd i'll guarantee your leaving out a very usefull spell.  I dont even have enough spell slots for myself, let alone a buff for others.  I'm not saying i dont ever SOW people, but its usually after i'm re-SOW'ing myself or i'm feeling generous enough to mem the spell to SOW them.  The thing is i'll usually do that for people that come to me in obscure uncrowded places.  But i'll usually ignore them if i'm in a crowded zone like EC.   <br>

I think a nice way to handle it is say 'i'm busy'.  Then if he says anything smart back just /ignore.

Thanks for showing what a complete and utter moron you are. In a battle, your JOB is to taunt creatures off a druid, as you can take the beating. OUR job is to keep them Snared, Rooted if need be, DoTed, Healing... etc.. we have MANY jobs to do,  you have ONE. And, SoWing you is not my JOB, its a FAVOR I can CHOOSE to do for you.<br>
<br>
Do not EVER lecture me on how to play, you are a warrior, what are you asked to do? Melee, thats it. you have NO other abilities besides in a fight. And fighting is the ONLY thing you can do.<br>
<br>
And, if your level 40, and not 22, then I would expect you to know the Word PLEASE, and not say &quot;Can You SoW Me&quot; ,I would expect &quot;Can You SoW me Please My Friend?&quot;<br>
<br>
Those simple words and I would have memmed it.<br>
<br>
To the other Druids reading this board, its not the fact that I didnt want to memm the spell, its the fact that he couldnt be bothered to say please, so why should I be bothered to mem the spell? Zoofy, its all in how you ask.<br>
<br>
And to the guys who HAVE backed me, thank you. <br>

maybe you do have a 51 druid, i know a lot of people who have ebay'd druids in there back pockets as port bitches, doesnt make them druid massiah's to preach on how one should act.<br>

how about lesson learned, and just remember to ask people politely in future... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxiggin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xiggin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/27/01 9:01:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Okies!</span><hr size=1> Broomhilda said:<br>

<br>
First off:  That genius's idea of /disband then Gate, just so he can leave someone in a danger area to die....  Are you that stupid?  Do you realize that if you arn't blacklisted for that already, you will be as soon as you do it?  That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard....  I wouldn't suggest doing it, espically if you truely have characters at that level.  Because if you do...  pulling a stunt like that probably means ditching a level 50+ character to die....someone who probably has a few friends...<br>
<br>
Second off: Warrior have one job....fight?  Are you that stupid?  Do you think a warrior just puts on autoattack then grabs a coke?!  What planet are you on freak?  Attack, Taunt, Kick, use Disc, switch targets incase dumbass casters (like your case) aggro other monsters, pull, FD pull (monks and Shadownights only), among other individul things, like monk special attacks, Shadownight spells, HT from Shadownights, LoH from Paladins, spells from paladin, ranger snare (yes, you will learn that at high levels, rangers should snare, because snare creates alot of hate, which keeps taunt on tanks) as well as other things.<br>
<br>
Third off: I did not get to level 52 as a druid because I refused SoW to people who forgot to insert &quot;please&quot; in their question on whether I will SoW them or not.  I did not attain level 52 because when I disagreed with a member of my group, I disbanded then gated out.  I DID however....attain level 52....by helping others, even when they were not &quot;Candy-cane-You are god of all&quot; sweet-talking me.  I made friends, and I had no need to solo to 52....unlike what you, mister Stun-gun, will have to do.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact....I had enough friends to be powerleveled from level 9 to 50 in about 20 days.<br>

PS: Hey Stun gun....  How did you know I wasn't going to say thank you after you SoWed me?  Infact, if you want me to, I will pull up the log of that conversation, and let everyone know how much of a bullshiter you really are....  If you remember right....I asked you &quot;Can I have a SoW?&quot; and you said &quot;One Sec.&quot;  Then I said &quot;Thanks.&quot;  Then you said,&quot;Don't have it memed, man.&quot;  But if you wish, I can email you the log, or I can post it on this topic...I just have no wish to ruin your reputation as a druid...  I said thanks, even before you sowed me....but you still didn't...  <br>
<br>
Yes Stungun....open mouth....insert foot<br>

He said himself the warrior said<br>
&quot;Can I get a Sow&quot;<br>
<br>
He didnt say  &quot;Gimme a Sow&quot;<br>
Didn't say  &quot;Sow me&quot;<br>
<br>
He said &quot;Can I get a Sow&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a polite way of asking, &quot;Can I get a Sow&quot;.<br>
Everyone who has posted that a &quot;please&quot; is needed in that statement needs to pull their heads out of their ass to see the light. A &quot;please&quot; is nice but saying you won't sow someone for not saying please is pretty high on the Lame-o list.<br>
Next are you gonna require them to call you Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms  before you will accede to their requests?<br>
<br>
The guy shouldn't of taken it to tells afterwards, but then again, he shouldn't have needed to. He should have been off and running with his sow, shouldn't he?  <br>
