<br>
Compare the number of cleric epics you see running around to the number of druid, magician or necromancer.  How about Rogue?  Those quests are so much easier it's a joke really.  The Druid quest is not bad except for the fact that Faydedar is a weird spawn and unless you can leave your computer on for hours at a time, or have a 2nd &quot;twink&quot; to watch the spires, then you'll never see him.<br>
<br>
Somehow I doubt the vision for the druid epic quest included a bunch of 1st lvl toons sitting at the spires in TD.  Call me crazy... <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=13578">Feral Nightstalker</a><br>

<br>
And showing our kiting skills by kiting a MOB for 3 hours?  Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.  I'm sure the clerics showed their healing abilities by healing something for 3 hours, the enchanters showed their abilities by mezzing the same target for 3 hours, the rogues picked the same lock for 3 hours .... bleh.  Our epic and the mage epic are some of the hardest in the game.  I think ours wins for monotony, though.  <br>

Having the Druid epic on my server actually means something.  It means you had the desire, patience, persistence, and the friends necessary to accomplish it.  Faydedar's difficulty makes it that much more special.  The druids on Prexus with the epic are far and away the best druids on the server in my opinion.  Only a few of the great druids on the server still do not have them.<br>
<br>
I'd hate to see such a rare item that sets druids apart reduced to yet another item that 200 druid on each server carry around.<br>
<br>
I completed the entire epic quest except for the Venril stone (because it used to be a rare drop) in under 10 days.  Now that the Venril Stone drops twice every three days, the quest is even easier.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, Faydedar is the only challenging part of epic quest.  It's the only thing keeping the servers from being flooded with druid epics.  I hope it stays the way it is.<br>

However, I do believe that camping for 100+ hours for a random spawn that despawns in 3 hours is a little rediculous.  I guess I don't believe that the only people who should get Faydedar are the ones that have 2 computers, 2 accounts and can be around for days on end w/out taking a break.  Yes, I know of those who haven't camped for long or whatever, but who can deny the majority of those who see faydedar have sat around for 12+ hours in one sitting and are ready to take an uzi to the local minimart out of frustration?  That doesn't make a game fun...<br>
<br>
I'd like to see him be the random spawn he is, but not despawn.  That way the once in a blue moon spawn he is would at least not go to waste just because the kiter died and didn't have someone else close by or it was during off hours and the camping druid was passed out drooling on their keyboard while their bait go steped on.  It may not solve the endless hours of camping, but maybe it would make a few more druids happy.<br>

I also think it should remain the way it is now. With only a few easy steps you, too, can get your Epic. These are:<br>
<br>
<br>
First and foremost...<br>
<br>
- Quit your job/school/etc., anything that might require you to leave your PC. Very important!<br>
<br>
<br>
For all us "grouping" Druids...<br>
<br>
- Appologize to all your friends that you can no longer group/raid w/ them anymore because you need to go practice "kiting" to hopefully stand a chance against all those soloing "dr00ds" out there competing for Faydedar. Don't even attempt to answer their confused queries concerning why Faydedar is not a triggered spawn (so that they can all come and assist you now while they are all actually <i>online</i>). Save your breath.<br>
<br>
(<i>Please</i> do not try to contemplate just how a soloing "dr00d" will manage to amasse a force out to TD to help kill the dragon. Instead direct your focus on the intriguing Bermuda Triangle; at least the mystery of how this phenomenon manages to suck people in is easier to understand. Rawr!)<br>
<br>
For practice, I suggest going to Timorous Deep and kiting one of the raptors out in the middle of the ocean. To give some fair semblance of what it will be like kiting Faydedar I suggest snaring yourself first. After 2-3 hours of this take a break, don't wear yourself out. Let your wrist take a rest or the cost of medical treatment will totally outweigh the expected cost of kiting Faydedar.<br>
<br>
<br>
You'll want some insurance to be sure death does not occur, otherwise someone who just watched you die will likely step in and take over. Or worse, Faydedar will despawn. Some in-game items (aside from MR/FR gear which you should already own, unless you're a soloing "dr00d") to help prevent this:<br>
<br>
- Acquire a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic. After kiting Faydedar for several hours (and of course factoring in lag/warping/etc.) you're bound to take a few nasty hits and won't be able to stop and heal yourself. This will help. (Approx. cost 40,000-50,000 platinum pieces.) Easy.<br>
<br>
- Acquire a Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring. It has an instant cast of "Grim Aura." Yes, the effect is useless to a Druid but it does give you a junk buff for Faydedar's dispelling. (Approx. cost 5,000-10,000 platinum pieces.) Easy.<br>
<br>
- Camp the AC, and do the Jboots quest. Yes, you can cast sow but you won't have time to do so when Faydedar dispells you and starts beating/breathing on you. Just skip a night's sleep in the hopes that no one is camping it the wee hours of the morning (not likely), or you can just be a "dr00d" and <i>take</i> the AC when it spawns. Piece of cake.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you plan on sitting in Timorous Deep yourself...<br>
<br>
- Run out to your nearest quality office supply store and purchase a really comfortable chair. You're going to be sitting for a <i>very</i> long time. Don't skim. (Approx. cost $99-200.)<br>
<br>
- On the way home from the office supply store you will want to stop by EB and pick up a brand new PS/2 w/ a few games. You won't be playing EQ so might as well. (Approx. cost $299 w/ games $400-500.)<br>
 <br>
<br>
There is an alternative to this:<br>
<br>
- Visit www.dell.com and purchase a 2nd PC for the explicit purpose of camping a "dummy" character in TD to camp for you. A little more costly but will actually allow you to play the game while you wait. (Approx. cost $899-1500 does not include shipping costs to your state, or applicable taxes. Approx. cost for 2nd copy of EQ $29 + $10/mo. for 2nd account.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Before I forget...<br>
<br>
- Stock up on antacids of your choice. I would highly suggest a month's supply worth. The constant stress of knowing that the moment Faydedar spawns a dozen or so Druids will suddenly appear in a furious frenzy and attempt to KS each other will eat a hole right through your stomach. (Approx. cost $10-35.) Valium(tm) can also be substituted, but may impair your ability to drive. See your Doctor for prescription.<br>
<br>
- Invest in a lucky charm. Rabbit Foot, Horse Shoe, Dashboard Dancing Hula Girl, whatever. I cannot stress how important this is. You'll need all the luck you can get to avoid Faydedar finally spawning after your 200+ hour camp only for it to be at four in the morning when everyone you know is in bed, <i>asleep</i> (where you should be).<br>
<br>
<br>
And last, but not least...<br>
<br>
- Throw out all your RPing sentiments toward this game. After all, there isn't anything RP-ish about doing any of the above, now is there?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. For the younger players reading who may not have caught my feeble attempt at sarcasm... PLEASE do NOT - repeat - DO NOT ever quit school for Everquest. If I hear of someone sacrificing a valuable education over this game I will literally /cry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care, and good luck. <p><br><br><br>

Nice post Sippy very moving.<br>
<br>
To all those Dr00ds who are lucky enough to have the 2 comp's and now have there Epic and are siting around saying &quot;oh i think Faydedar is fine as he is&quot; I got a big middle finger waiting for you.  <br>
<br>
I agree the quest is easy, VS is a wuss now, some of the tainted/corupted require 2 or 3 people but that's nothing.  Obviously we all know the quest is FUBAR'd, and I hope Verant realizes that to by now.<br>

<br>
I'd like to see Verant put &quot;epic&quot; into the druid epic.  <br>
<br>
If you really think about it.  The druid epic is VERY easy on the diffaculty scale but EXTREMELY boring due to the camping factor.<br>
<br>
I agree with most the posts that I really don't want to suddenly see every druid with their epic as standard equiptment.  That wasn't the intent.  I also agree that the quest as it is today it just a tedius long boring camp from beginning to end.  Changing Faydedar only solves a very small peice of the over all problem.  <br>
<br>
I don't know the solution.  I just hope Verant can come with with a good solution that doesn't ruin the quest and make it stupidly easy and therefore the druid epic becomes common and all the other classes have yet another thing to add to the bitch about druids list.  The other concern is if the quest goes under a major change what of all the druids that have quest componets already...  <br>
<br>
I don't see an easy way out...<br>
<br>
Maybe if Faydedar did become a triggered spawn, he should certainly get a good buffing.  ie.  level 60+ dragon, more hitpoints etc.  His loot drop table is already very nice.  Waterdragon Shield is on par with Serv and Talendor shields.  But Serv and Talendor are level 60 dragons.  /boggle<br>
<br>
Camping is what make the druid epic hard.  That really needs to be changed to less camping but harder things to kill imo.<br>

How many people are impressed when they see a high-level rogue with a Ragebringer? (no one)<br>
How many people are impressed when they see a high-level cleric with a Sprinkler? (not many)<br>
How many people are impressed when they see a high-level druid with a Nature Walker's Scim? (almost everyone)<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally, I thought the whole Faydedar thing was very in-character, and very fitting to the quest.<br>
<br>
The corrupted portion of the quest starts with low-level mobs, and builds up to the epic, Faydedar.  Most who have actually camped and killed Faydedar will agree that the hours that follow his initial spawn are by far the most exciting moments of their entire EQ carreers.  And the final moment when he dies, and you loot the Pod are the ultimate climax to the epic quest.<br>
<br>
His elusiveness, and the small margin for error are what make him so difficult.  If he were as simple and predictable as a triggered spawn, it wouldn't be nearly as exciting.  There would really be no climax to the epic quest.<br>
<br>
The Faydedar kite is the ultimate test of a druid's kiting ability.<br>
<br>
Kiting Raptors is an excellent way to pass the time while waiting for him to spawn if you don't want to use  a mule.  After each kite, take a 30 second run south of the raptor island and med out on the water while tracking for him.  If it winds up being a 1-week camp, at least you'll gain a level or two.  There's also so many people out there with 2 accounts and 2 computers, you could probably find a friend who would be willing to put a mule on the spires for you.<br>
<br>
There really are options to this.  You could camp him an hour or two every couple days.  Eventually he'll show up.  There's no need to make it a marathon camp.  I work an average of 61 hours a week (No, not all of us are losers).  I camped him a couple hours a day until he finally showed.  It was a good time to catch up on paperwork, house cleaning, etc.<br>
<br>
Don't beg for a shortcut for this quest.  Complete it the way it is.  When you finish it, the elation you feel will make it all seem worth it.  If Faydedar is handed to you on a platter, the quest and the Nature Walker's Scimitar become something less than impressive.  The weapon itself is not awesome.  But it's a symbol that tells everyone, and especially yourself, that you were able to complete the greatest quest you may ever come upon.  Don't focus on the stats or the effects of the weapon itself.  Think about what it symbolizes. <p><center><a href="mailto:twygg@prexus.com">Twygg</a> of <a href="http://www.prexus.com/">Prexus</a><br>

<br>
and no, when i see a druid with an epic i am not really impressed to be honest.  i congratulate them on having it, as it is a nice weapon but i am not impressed.  it just means they were lucky enough to find a dumb dragon, keep him up long enough to get xx number of players there and take him down.<br>
<br>
i think its a much more viable solution to change the faydedar part of the quest.  to make it so that not every druid has one, make the guy that triggers the last corrupt mob (faydedar or whatever they want to rename it) spawn once an EQ week or something.  if they put a little thoought into it, they could actually come up with something that fits the storyline.  for instance:  there are twin brothers.  one has been corrupted by inno.  the good one (make him a druid if you want) wants his brother to be released from his corruption.  he has this key he found in his adventures that is no use to him because he doesnt konw what it is.  ( its the key to faydedar's &quot;cage&quot; - to make him spawn).  he will give you said key upon proof of his brother's demise.  make the corrupted brother a spawn in hate or something perhaps like the pally item required there.  he drops his head upon death.  you take the head to the good brother, he gives you the key.  you then take the key to an NPC that &quot;releases&quot; the corrupted dragon to be killed.  *shrugs* at least it fits the story.  heck make him level 60 if you want the difficulty.  <br>
<br>
this type of scenario would add two dimensions to the quest:  requires a planar trip hence making it more difficult to obtain (need a raid) and adds another mob to make it enter the world at a slow rate. (isnt that the vision (tm)?)<br>
<br>
besides everyone pays their 10 bucks a month.  what makes one person more deserving than another for a pixel on a computer screen when they pay the same amount of money? *shrugs* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugalaintreeavenger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galain Treeavenger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/27/01 5:36:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faydedar gettin nerfed o rsomething.</span><hr size=1> I don't think Fay should be made 'easy'.  I am all for making him on par with the other Kunark dragons.  Or at least Zordak.  I just don't see how you can think that sitting in one place for hours, and then running in circles for a few more hours, makes the quest 'epic'.  I say buff him up.  He is too easy to kill.  He is just too hard to find.<br>
<br>
And it is ridiculous how much competition there is for him.  That is, if you count who can sit in one place the longest or be the most antisocial as competition.  That competition results in KSing a lot.  I could go on but I'm turning my rant switch off. <p><HR>
