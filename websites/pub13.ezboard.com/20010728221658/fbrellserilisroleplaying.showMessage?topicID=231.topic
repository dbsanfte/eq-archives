<br>
The sun burned hotly above the many people waiting in the lineup.  Raff wiped his forehead with the back of his shirtsleeve and shifted wordlessly.  He'd been in line now for over 3 hours, but at least he was nearing the front.  After two more people it would be his turn.  He placed his large wooden staff firmly on the ground and leaned on it.  I'm too old for this he thought to himself as he looked around at the others waiting patiently in line.  His face had a slightly leathery appearance, but overall he didn't look anything near his age.  At 35 he'd seen more than his share of the world, and during the last few years, his lifestyle had extracted a great toll from him, but there was a spark of life in his eyes that made most people think he'd just spent too many years in the desserts of Ro where the wind swept sand turned a boys face to a man's in a few years.   When he moved it was the motion of an older man - a careful confident movement that suggested his body had been everywhere before.  The unaware would think they were dealing with a man well into his 40's until they saw his eyes.  When they did, they knew there was much more to this man than they expected.  Raff had the kind of eyes that warned fools off, deterred would-be swindlers, and forced thieves to consider easier targets.  Now he turned those eyes on the young men and women around him.<br>
<br>
Ahead of him were two young boys, both blonde haired blue eyed.  They shifted excitedly, occasionally looking around as if they didn't belong here in the Academy of Arcane Science.  The first boy was answering questions quietly, his voice breaking occasionally in nervousness.  There were four representatives questioning him, asking him about various things including his parentage, his skills in other areas, and his motivations for wanting to join the guild.  Raff watched detachedly as the boy nodded his head and bowed, barely concealing his excitement.  It appeared, from the boy's reaction, as if he'd been accepted.  A moment later the boy left, flashing a quick smile to his twin. <br>
<br>
Raff and the boy in front of him waited patiently as the four men at the table discussed amongst themselves.  A short while later one of them, a gnome, turned to the boy and asked him to step forward.  Raff moved forward, taking the boy’s place and leaned once again on his staff.  As he waited he considered what he was about to do.<br>
<br>
After four years of alcohol-induced gambling, fighting and whoring he was finally going to do something with his life.  The pain of his wife's death still burned deeply in his heart, and he knew he'd never be completely rid of it, but he felt the time had come for him to find a way to go on with his life.  He wasn't doing it for himself because, truthfully, he didn't give a damn about his life.  Instead he was going to make something of his life because he knew that Glorias would be furious with him if he didn't.  Even dead his wife was a source of motivation for him.  Besides, he thought, if Erollisi ever found her way to see the two of them reunited he'd have a lot of explaining to do, and, even in death, he didn't relish explaining to his wife how he'd managed to waste the years of his life following her death.  And so, magician school was his ticket to a new life.<br>
<br>
Raff looked past the balcony he was standing on and gazed at the water below.  He slowly ran two fingers along his thick moustache and sighed.  This is the right thing to do he said to himself reassuringly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; a voice shocked Raff out of his thoughts.  He turned to the speaker and blinked.<br>
<br>
The four men behind the large wooden table were all looking at him.  The gnome who had spoken to him has a bemused look on his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Were you applying for the janitor position?&quot; the gnome said.  The four men laughed loudly at the remark and glanced knowingly amongst themselves.  The gnome put his hands behind his head casually and leaned back in his chair.  In spite of himself, Raff felt his face flushing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pardon me.&quot; He spoke carefully. &quot;I was lost in thought.&quot;  Raff bowed stiffly and tried to compose himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;And what can we do for you&quot; said an older brown haired man at the end of the table.  He still wore a large smile from the previous joke.  &quot;If it's not for the janitor's position, then what are you here for?”<br>
<br>
Raff cleared his throat and spoke carefully.  &quot;I wish to apply for entrance into the Academy of Arcane Science.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; Said the gnome, his hands still behind his head. &quot;And what is it that makes you think we'd be interested in someone as old as you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff licked his lips. He was prepared for this.  &quot;I believe that the school judges people on their abilities and not on their age.  In fact, the older a magician is, the more powerful they become.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome pointed a tiny finger at Raff and leaned forward. &quot;Old magicians are powerful because they started young Raff.  Look around you. Do you see any other old applicants?  There's a reason for that.  You can't learn all the subtleties of our art in a few years. It takes a lifetime.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other three men nodded in silent agreement.<br>
<br>
Raff nodded at the men before him.  &quot;I understand that, and I know my path will be a hard one, but I've considered this at great length and I firmly believe it is the path for me.  I simply must work harder than the younger students to make up for lost time. However, I will have experience as an advantage. I know much more about life and it's struggles than any younger pupil. I'm no stranger to hard work, to trials and tribulations, or to failure. I know these things all too well.&quot;  He bowed his head solemnly. &quot;And I will do what must be done to be successful.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gnome leaned forward, clasping his hands together and leaning on the table.  &quot;Raff,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;We know all about your experience.&quot;  He spoke as if he didn't want to have the words in his mouth too long lest they foul him with their taint.  He glared at Raff and hissed, &quot;Your experience with whores and vodka won't do you any good in my school, and we won't have you or your kind taking the position of a younger, better, honest and more capable student.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff's head snapped up and his eyes widened at the gnome’s words.  The tiny magician narrowed his eyes and leaned back into his chair slowly.  Raff blinked and turned his head slowly to the others.  The brown haired man looked embarrassed and held out a hand as if to calm everyone.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Look,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I don't think this has to become nasty.&quot;  He looked up at Raff.  &quot;Raff, I'm afraid I have to agree with Dooly.  Your reputation does precede you.  Surely you had thought about this?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff opened his mouth and stood in stunned speechlessness.  His mouth worked as if he was about to talk, but he couldn't find the words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Raff,&quot; began a middle-aged man as he looked between Dooly and Raff.  &quot;The School has a certain reputation to uphold.  We have to consider what allowing you in would do to our status among the other guilds in the Academy.  You must understand that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What must I do to prove myself then&quot; Raff spoke, his voice barely audible.  &quot;Surely you must understand my behavior over the last few years was a reaction to my wife's death at the hands of the orcs.&quot;  There was no response from the men at the table.  He leaned forward and spoke quietly, his voice tight with anger.  &quot;You can't do this to me! I've finally taken the steps to improve my life.  Look at me!  I'm not the same man I was a month ago!  You cannot deny that!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's true Raff, but...&quot; began the brown haired man.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine Raff.&quot; Interrupted Dooly.  &quot;You're not the same man now.  How long will it be before you revert to that man?  How long before the stress of training causes you to break and once again go on a drunken spree of thieving and whoring?  Or, Brell forbid, what happens when you snap once we have taught you some of our secrets and use them in your rage?  What then Raff?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you will deal with me as you would any other student. I would be punished, perhaps expelled.  But until that happens, you have no right to refuse...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot; Dooly slammed his small hand down upon the table.  &quot;You will not be a member of the magician's guild.  Begone!&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff started in surprise.  He looked at the other three men carefully.  None would look at him.  Slowly he turned his gaze toward Dooly who had once again leaned back in his chair casually.  Raff trembled slightly with the anger building within him and leaned forward with deliberate slowness until he was mere inches from Dooly's face.  His hands gripped the edge of the table and he glared at the gnome. Dooly returned the fiery gaze with his own, but he was unprepared for what he saw.  In Raff's eyes he saw the smoldering fury of a man who would stop at nothing to seek vengeance.  The gnome knew such a man was dangerous and he swallowed slowly in spite of himself and prepared himself for a blow.  For a moment everything was silent.  The people waiting in line who had been chatting stopped.  Those with a gift for magic could feel Dooly drawing upon his magical energies.  <br>
<br>
Then Raff said quietly &quot;I suppose we'll see about that.&quot;  With those words he stood, turned and strode away quickly.<br>

These thoughts were firmly in the front of Raff's mind as he tried to calmly walk past the Dragoons guarding the entrance to Neriak.  They scowled at him, but didn't move to attack.  Raff was betting his life they wouldn't regard him as dangerous, and this day, his gamble paid off.  If they decided to destroy him then and there,  he could do little to stop them, and this time there would be no temple of Marr to resurrect him;  death would be permanent.  He managed to keep his breathing controlled as he walked into the darkness that was the city of the dark elves, but his heart was racing.<br>
<br>
Raff had heard many times how the depths of Neriak were dark, but he was unprepared for the utter blackness around him.  He waited just inside the entrance for his heart to slow down and his eyes to adjust to the change in lighting, but it was useless. Long after his heart had slowed he still couldn't see a thing.  He had prepared for such an event, and fumbled around in his backpack searching for one of the torches he'd brought with him.  Once he had one in hand, he retrieved a tinderbox and lit it.  The weak light of the torch was like a bonfire in the thick darkness, casting flickering shadows along the smooth walls and by its light Raff noticed he was not alone.   Not far from him, resting on the floor, two Dark Elves were speaking with each other quietly.  As he walked past them he noticed with some relief that they didn't seem concerned enough to even lift their heads.  <br>
<br>
Good he thought.  They don't see me as a threat.  It was true of course; Raff wasn't a threat.  A single human in the underground city of the Dark Elves couldn't possibly be a threat.  In fact, Raff was the one feeling threatened, and with good reason.  He knew all too well the stories about what the Dark Elves did to intruders.  He turned and looked back at where he'd entered Neriak and noticed with some concern that even though he'd progressed only a dozen feet or so, the entrance was completely enshrouded in darkness.  He turned his head forward and continued on.<br>
<br>
His progress was slow and often he had to stop and bring his torch close to the ground so he could see the floor beneath him.  He knew of the dangerous drop offs and sheer precipices found in Neriak, knowledge that forced him to proceed carefully.  In the distance he could make out a strange red and blue glowing object.  He saw no better destination, so he continued his slow pace toward the object.  <br>
<br>
He began to think, not for the last time, that his judgment was impaired when he chose to come to this place.  For the hundredth time in the last day he considered his plans.  After the way the Academy of Arcane Science rejected him, he felt he didn't have many choices left.  So.  According to the Academy he was no good for them; he wasn't the type of person they needed in their school.  Fine.  Raff wasn't about to give up.  He had been through his options as many times as he could, and there weren't any alternatives.  At least no good alternatives.  He had to do something with his life, and he wasn't about to return to the life of scraping and saving for years to build an inn.  He was too old to start over.  What he needed was something lucrative - something he could make a living off of now, not ten years from now.  And, there was no doubt in his mind that danger was something he wanted.  As far as he was concerned, his life was barely worth living.  In fact, the only reason he had to go on was the memory of Glorias, and how she'd react when he met her again.  He didn't relish explaining to his beautiful wife how he'd wasted 40 years of his life because he was feeling sorry for himself.  He sighed heavily as he trudged along.<br>
<br>
He was nearing the glowing object when his torch burned out.  The red and blue glow played eerily along the walls giving them a magical look.  He rummaged through his pack to find another torch, silently cursing himself for not watching the first one more carefully.  Hopefully this is the last day I need to light a torch he thought as he cursed quietly.  The strange lights made it difficult to find anything in his pack; they were bright enough to confuse his human eyes, yet weak enough that they didn't help him discern anything.  Finally, after much feeling around in his pack, he retrieved a fresh torch, lit it, and stood up, slinging his pack back onto his shoulder.  He held the torch high and tried to make out his surroundings.<br>
<br>
From the little he could see, he thought he was standing on a bridge.  He heard the faint sound of running water, but there was no way to tell how high above that water he was.  He swung the torch around, trying to see more, but his eyes were denied so he continued toward the glowing symbol.  The walkway he was on sloped upward and he soon realized he would pass underneath the glowing object.  He stopped and looked at it a moment, holding the torch away from his eyes so that it's light didn't interfere with the object's magical glow.  After a futile attempt to comprehend the object's meaning he decided it must be a Dark Elf symbol of some type.  He brought his torch back toward his body, turned his head back to where he was headed, and froze.  Less than 10 feet away from him were two Dragoons.  They weren't moving, but their mere presence drove a dagger of fear into Raff's chest.  He willed himself to breathe, slowly working air into his lungs.  The guards didn't seem to notice him, but he couldn't escape the feeling that they were somehow laughing at his fear.  He swallowed and forced himself to look past them.  About 20 feet behind the guards there was a large metal gate.  He walked up to it cautiously, somehow finding the strength of will to force his feet to move past the ominous guards.  He found the mechanism that raised the portcullis and pulled on it.  It moved with remarkable ease, and the gate lifted into the surrounding rock with a dark metallic clanking, driven by some unseen force.  Raff looked to his side and noticed with great relief that the guards were still ignoring him.  He continued on.<br>
<br>
The glow produced by the strange object quickly faded as he walked deeper into the subterranean city, and a few footsteps later he was once again straining to see his surroundings.  From the information he was able to gather, he thought the commons should be nearby.  There he would find illumination sufficient for his human eyes, because the commons was home to many races, including humans. A short while later his prediction was confirmed when the sounds of busy people floated down the passageway.   A long passage and three turns later he could see the glow he was looking for.  The random flicker of light shed from torches and lanterns danced along the walls of the cavern ahead of him.  He rallied his nerves and strode into the open commons area in a manner he hoped looked confident.<br>
<br>
The cavern was enormous; the ceiling vaulted high above Raff's head and disappeared in the obscurity of darkness.  All around him there were shops, street vendors, and taverns.  People of all races, from human to gnome bustled around moving from merchant to merchant, all intent on their own business.  The dull hum of hundreds of voices mixed easily with the chaotic jumble of smells from bakeries, taverns, leather shops, and smithies. If it wasn't for the deep darkness surrounding them it could easily be an ordinary scene from Freeport.  Raff thought this might be what Freeport would look like if its people were nocturnal. As he looked around his stomach grumbled in protest of the smells surrounding him and he realized he hadn't eaten since he woke up 5 hours earlier.  Cautiously he placed a hand firmly on his belt pouch and checked to make sure his knife was within easy reach.  Years of living on the streets of Freeport had taught him well..<br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of the way, ya daft bugger!&quot;  Raff felt a hand on his back and was roughly shoved forward as a group of humans moved past him, intent on quenching their thirst at a nearby tavern.  Moments later he was bumped to the side by a Dwarf wearing a gleaming blue set of full plate armour as the powerful warrior walked past. He was quickly shoved back by another and then another until he was pressed against the wall of the cavern.  Resolutely he began working his way through the sea of people to the opposite side from where he'd entered the commons area.  The process was slow, and he had to pause more than once to allow people to squeeze past him before continuing on.<br>
<br>
After he crossed the open market square he stopped to determine where he was.  He unrolled a small map from inside his pack and examined it briefly.  He figured the mages guild was nearby, and began walking in its direction, rolling up his map as he went.  From what he knew of the Dark Elves, they would accept him into their guild as long as he was willing to do what was necessary.  He was grimly aware that he might not want to do everything they requested, but was absolutely resolute to do whatever it took to secure a position within the guild.  Visions of horrible requests had filled his head over the last few days, but regardless of the cost,  he had decided he was going to be a mage.  He would not let Glorias down; he would do something with his life.  It really didn't matter to Raff anyway. As far as he was concerned, his life was worthless, and there was nothing anyone could take away from him that hadn't been taken long ago.<br>
<br>
He found the ramp leading up to the mages guild and walked up it, his torch held above his head.  The light here was less than in the commons area, but still much greater than the utter blackness before the commons.  As he reached the top of the ramp, he noticed an iron gate blocking his way.  This time there were no Dragoons standing beside it.  He took a deep breath and reached out to pull down the lever that worked the gate.  Again the gate disappeared into the ceiling effortlessly, this time with the dry rumble of stone on stone.  Raff found himself wondering if every gate had it's own unique sound.  He walked into the room beyond the gate thrusting his torch ahead of him.  <br>
<br>
As he moved forward he heard the unmistakable sound of a magic spell being cast. To his right he saw the floating wisps of magical energy coalescing into the hands of a Dark Elf. He turned to face the caster and started to bow in a formal greeting.  He had barely begun to bend at his waist when a bolt of fire shot out from the hands of the dark elf and struck him squarely in his chest. The heat from the magical fire seared his flesh and he cried out in pain as his body was enveloped with hot licks of flame.  He dropped his torch and fell to his knees, his hands gripping his thighs tightly as his body shook with pain. The pain remained after the brief flash of fire, but a moment later he was able to open his eyes.  He looked down at his hands and noticed they were reddened but still functional.  The hair along his arms was singed and shriveled, and he found himself reaching his face to feel if his eyebrows were still there.  The pain was subsiding as he confirmed the presence of his eyebrows and moustache.  His tunic was blackened and burned where the bolt of fire had struck him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are weak, Dog!&quot; a voice said above him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shall I burn him again and end his intrusion once and for all?&quot; said another.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let us see what he has to say on his own behalf,&quot; said the first voice.<br>
<br>
Raff felt a boot on his shoulder and looked up from his chest where he was examining his burned tunic.<br>
<br>
&quot;What are you here for, human worm?&quot; asked the owner of the second voice.  He was a shorter Dark Elf wearing a reddish gray robe.  His long white hair was a stark contrast to his blood red eyes and dark blue skin.  &quot;I asked you a question, human. If you should wish to live more than a moment from now, I would suggest you answer immediately.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff swallowed and struggled to find his voice. He was nearly paralyzed with fear and knew the tiniest mistake now would cost him his life.  He managed to speak slowly, his voice remarkably even considering his hands were shaking against his thighs.  &quot;I seek entrance to your guild. I wish to learn the ways of the Teir'Dal, and learn the skills of a magician.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second Dark Elf pushed against Raff with his boot, causing him to topple from his knees.  &quot;Master T'Rald, we do not need any more initiates, especially one as useless this one.  May I destroy him?&quot;<br>
<br>
Master T'Rald looked down at Raff as he returned to a kneeling position.  &quot;Get up.&quot; He said simply.<br>
<br>
Raff moved to his feet as calmly as he could, trying to appear under control.  He recalled that the Teir’Dal despised weakness and forced himself to return the Dark Elf's gaze.  Master T'Rald looked older, even for a Dark Elf.  His black eyes were set deep into his head and topped with bushy white eyebrows.  His short hair was white and stood out sharply next to his dark blue skin.  He wore a full-length blood red robe with many yellow markings along the collar and cuffs.<br>
<br>
&quot;So human,&quot; he spoke quietly and looked unblinkingly at Raff, &quot;What makes you think we would want to train you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Show no weakness! Raff thought.  Just answer his question. Although he was shaking inside, Raff forced his voice to speak clearly.  &quot;My own people, of Freeport, have deemed me unworthy of their school.&quot;<br>
<br>
The second Dark Elf scowled. &quot;And you feel we would find you worthy where mere humans have not?&quot;  He stepped forward and slapped Raff across his face.  &quot;Now dog, I shall take pleasure in causing you great pain before I kill you.  And when I am done with you, I shall find your woman and see if she's worth my time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff grimaced and gritted his teeth.  His hands closed into fists and suddenly his fear was gone, replaced by a cold anger.  He turned to look at the younger Dark Elf, a look of deathly seriousness in his eyes.  &quot;You will regret that,&quot; he said quietly, his voice strained with anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough Kezlat.  There is fire in this one.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Kezlat opened his mouth to reply, hesitated, and then moved back from Raff to stand beside the other Elf.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name, Human?&quot; asked Master T'Rald.<br>
<br>
Raff's willed his hands to unclench and his arms to relax.  &quot;Raff, Master.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is a simple name, Human.  We do not just let anyone into our guild; you must prove yourself to be worthy of our teaching first.  Do you know of our Father, Innoruuk?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff nodded.  &quot;Yes, I do know of Innoruuk.  He is the god of Hate, and the father of your people&quot;.<br>
<br>
Kezlat narrowed his eyes.  &quot;And what could you possibly know of Hate, dog?  You are a mere human.  You are not worthy of the father's strength.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff sneered and turned to face Kezlat. &quot;I know I hate you,&quot; he said coldly.<br>
<br>
Kezlat watched Raff carefully, noticing the menacing look in the human's eyes.  He turned to look at T'Rald.  &quot;Master,&quot; he sneered, &quot;I ask for the chance to test this one.&quot;  He turned back to Raff, his own sneer spreading across his face. &quot;I wish to prove him unworthy to serve the Father.&quot;<br>
<br>
T'Rald nodded at his student. &quot;Very well, Kezlat, you shall get the chance.&quot;  He turned to Raff. &quot;In order to be accepted into our guild you must pass a test of worth.  Every initiate must pass this test, and it is quite simple, really, but few actually pass it.  All you must do is kill one of us in combat.  Those who volunteer to battle prospective initiates are most often new to our guild, but there is no restriction.  Any one of us can challenge one requiring initiation, but most often it is not worth the time for our advanced students.  Kezlat here is much more powerful than most initiates, and has already learned the basics of elemental summoning, but since has requested to be the one to test your worthiness, he shall be the one to do so.  Most initiates are tested by those students who have not yet learned the art of elemental summoning.  This shall be an interesting test indeed.  We shall soon know of your strength, human.&quot;<br>
<br>
T'Rald turned and strode away, his robe fluttering about him.  &quot;Come this way. We shall end this now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff followed after T'Rald quickly. Kezlat scowled at him as he walked past but then fell in behind him.  As they walked along they passed a number of students who questioned the presence of an unknown human in their guildhalls. The students rapidly exchanged whispers as they passed, often falling in behind the three.  By the time they reached the open area they were being followed by over a dozen young students, two of which were human.<br>
<br>
Raff looked around in the large cavern they'd entered.  He assumed he was standing in the space where he would soon be battling Kezlat. It was a large flat area surrounded by smooth stone walls rising over thirty feet above the battleground.  Above the walls, overlooking the battle area were rows of stone platforms, much like benches, where the students sat in order to get a good view of the upcoming fight.  Raff estimated this amphitheatre could easily hold 300 people.  The entire area was lit with a diffuse light provided by hundreds of glowing symbols similar to the one Raff had seen when he first entered Neriak.  When he completed his visual survey of the arena he noticed Master T'Rald had taken his seat in a dark polished stone chair raised about ten feet above the field.  Large stone steps, inlaid with the same strange glowing symbols he had noticed earlier, alternating between red and blue, lead up to the chair.  The chair, or throne as Raff considered it, was itself lined with blood red and deep dark purple glowing lines.  The lights helped give the entire area a surreal look, and Raff felt as if he was in a dream, regardless of the great peril his life was currently in.  He noticed there were four blood-red squares set into the stone floor, glowing dimly, one along each of the four sides of the area.  The Dark Elves seemed to have a fascination with the color of blood.  Raff considered that it might make clean up easier after a challenge.<br>
<br>
More students had filed in, and now the seating area held over 30 spectators, most of them talking quietly amongst themselves, no doubt speculating upon how quickly Raff would be destroyed by the more powerful Kezlat.  T'Rald cleared his throat and a blanket of silence fell upon the assemblage.  The Dark Elf master leaned forward in his chair, steepled his fingers as if in casual discussion, and then began to speak with a clear resonant voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are here this day to witness the test of worthiness of the human Raff.  He has requested that we admit him into our guild and train him in the ways of the magician.  Although Raff has no magical training whatsoever, Kezlat, a magician of the first rank of the second circle, has requested that he be the one to test the depth of Raff's strength.  In accordance with our customs, any other may test Raff if they can best Kezlat in combat first. Is there anyone who wishes to challenge Kezlat for the task of testing this human?&quot;<br>
<br>
T'Rald slowly scanned the crowd and waited patiently before speaking again.  Raff could feel a droplet of sweat roll down his forehead as he stood rigidly.  He was rapidly considering his alternatives, and there seemed to be few.  Escape was completely impossible, even if he would have considered it, and he would not; his path was laid out before him, and behind him there was nothing.  Slowly he clenched and unclenched his hands, allowing his right to fall closed on the handle of the knife he kept in his belt.  Gripping the handle tightly, drew the long knife out of it's scabbard slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Since there are no requests to challenge Kezlat,&quot; continued T'Rald &quot;I shall now allow him to prove the worthiness of this human.&quot;  He turned his head and spoke directly to Raff.  &quot;Now, human, you must know the rules under which this challenge will take place.  You will take your place opposite Kezlat, on one of the red squares.  Once Kezlat has reached his square, he will begin summoning an elemental.  It is his duty to destroy you, and it is your duty to destroy him.  His elemental will make things difficult for you, but, if you are strong enough, that will not matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
He turned his dark eyes upward and looked out across the arena to the crowd.  &quot;You may begin now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff watched as Kezlat bowed deeply before T'Rald and then he copied the Dark Elf, bowing deeply toward the throne.  As he did he removed the blade at his side fully from its scabbard.  His heart was racing in his chest, pounding insistently.  He stood stiffly and turned to see Kezlat's back as the Dark Elf walked toward the red square at the far end of the arena.  Raff's mind was whirling.  Once Kezlat reached his starting square, he would begin summoning an elemental and once the elemental appeared, Raff's death was assured.  Raff knew no magic whatsoever - no summoning, no protection, and no attack spells.  He glanced at the red square Kezlat was walking to, and then to its twin across the arena.  The distance was nearly 100 feet.  He knew if he tried to close that distance he would die before he was halfway to his enemy.  He knew at that instant, there was only one course of action open to him.  <br>
<br>
He turned toward Kezlat who was over twenty feet from him now and sprinted toward him.  He could feel the eyes of every person on him and Kezlat as he closed the distance between them.  Kezlat heard the scrape of Raff's boots on the stone floor, stopped and turned around to see what had caused the noise.  He had barely turned fully around when Raff plunged his knife deeply into his chest.  He clutched feebly at the knife, his eyes wide in shock, but Raff pulled the knife out as soon as it entered the Elf and brought it down again, harder, burying it to the hilt.  Raff's face was contorted in a sinister snarl as he viciously drove the knife again and again into the Dark Elf's chest.  He stabbed continuously until the Kezlat flopped to the ground, lifeless.  Raff looked at the dead Elf at his feet, and then at the blood slicked knife in his hand.  He was shaking with rage as he sheathed the knife, distantly aware of the blood spatters on his robe. He turned and walked back to the large black throne and bowed stiffly before T’Rald.  The arena had become utterly silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've done as you requested, Master.  I have defeated the challenger.  May I be granted admission to the guild?&quot;  He looked directly into T'Rald's face.<br>
<br>
T’Rald returned Raff’s gaze, his face unreadable. &quot;You have made a mockery of our custom human. You have killed a young magician by attacking when he was unprepared.  For this you request to be granted admission?&quot;  T’Rald’s voice was perfectly calm, belying no emotion whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Raff ‘s eyes burned with intensity. &quot;You asked me what I knew of Hate, Master, and I have this answer for you.”  He paused and looked around him at the stunned students, then slowly brought his gaze back to T’Rald.  “I hate losing.”<br>
<br>
T'Rald stared down at Raff for a long while, his face impassive.  Slowly a smile spread across his dark blue face, and finally he laughed.  &quot;Perhaps there is something to you after all human.   Perhaps you will have what it takes to be a magician of Neriak.  You have passed only one trial, Initiate Raff.  There will be many more, and they will be much more difficult.  May Innoruuk lend strength to your hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this he stood and walked gracefully down the steps, strode out of the arena, and disappeared. Minutes later the audience was gone as well, and Raff was the only person standing in the eerie blue and red glow.  <br>
<br>
A devastating feeling of utter aloneness washed over him and he fell to his knees and wept.<br>

<br>
&quot;Do, you have a question concerning the power of Hate Chaydar?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff sagged in his chair and groaned to himself.  If there was one thing he'd learned over the last two months in Neriak, it was to never, ever, get involved in a conversation with anyone about Innoruuk, the god of Hate.  The dark elves loved to pontificate endlessly on the wisdom of a life based on hate, and master Y'Ran was a priest of Innoruuk, and one of the most adamant teachers in Neriak.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please forgive my ignorance, master Y'Ran, but I only wish to learn more about the Father, and I don't have the benefit of growing up in the Teir'Dal society,” Chaydar said quietly, his eyes never straying to master Y'Ran's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;The error would be if you refused to learn about Our Father, and thus remained ignorant.  Ask.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chaydar cleared his throat nervously. &quot;Aren't some people, such as the Fier’Dal or the Koada'Dal, motivated by kindness?&quot; Chaydar paused while Master Y'Ran pursed his lips and stopped pacing.  &quot;I'm not suggesting their way is better, and in fact, I'd say they're foolish for allowing such silly notions to cloud their thoughts, but...&quot; Chaydar was speaking rapidly now, his words bumbling amongst themselves as he spoke.  &quot;I mean...&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Y'Ran raised his hand calmly and Chaydar fell silent.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a typical view of humans, caused by a gross misunderstanding not only of Innoruuk's teachings, but also your own motivations.&quot; He paused, his hand remaining up, but with only one finger raised.  &quot;The Fier’Dal and Koada'Dal might think they are motivated by kindness, but in fact, they are not.&quot; Master Y'Ran smiled slightly. &quot;Take, for example, food.&quot; He turned his red eyes on Chaydar. &quot;Why do you eat Chaydar?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... I suppose... because I'm hungry?  And eating makes me feel good?&quot; Chaydar answered, unsure of himself. &quot;Food tastes good?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Y'Ran's voice resonated clearly in the room. &quot;This is a typical answer from one who lacks knowledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chaydar lowered his head and said weakly, “Forgive me Master, I wish to learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Y'Ran returned to his slow pacing, waving his hand at Chaydar dismissively.  &quot;It is not important that you do not know, but instead that you will know.&quot; He clasped his hands behind his back again and continued. &quot;You must approach this in terms of Hate Chaydar.  You must always think as Innoruuk instructs us.  You do not eat because it makes you feel good, but instead because you hate being hungry.  If you ate because eating made you feel good, then you would never stop eating.  Instead, you eat until your discomfort - your hunger, and your hatred of that hunger - is gone.  You are motivated by your hatred, not your pleasure.&quot;<br>
<br>
Y'Ran paused and turned his head slightly upward, a thoughtful expression on his face.  &quot;Initiate Raff, what are the prime emotional motivators?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pain, suffering, and misery, Master Y'Ran.  And our hatred of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very good Raff.  And why are we motivated to drink?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We hate the sensation of thirst,&quot; Raff answered crisply.<br>
<br>
&quot;And why do we try to increase our power and influence?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We merely hate the feelings of helplessness and weakness.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What of sex and love, initiate Raff?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff fought a sickening feeling in his stomach.  &quot;It is the hatred we feel for irritation in the loins that drives us to copulate and love is an emotion inspired by self-hatred, the most powerful distillation of hate.  To love someone is to hate yourself enough to subjugate your mind to the will of another.&quot;  Raff spoke in a slow monotone as if he had recited the same sentence a thousand times.<br>
<br>
Master Y'Ran allowed a small smile to creep into his features.  &quot;Excellent Raff, as always.  You continue to grow in your knowledge and understanding.  Had you been born a Teir'Dal, you might have been able to be truly great.&quot;  He paused a moment to allow the compliment time to sink into the other students.<br>
<br>
&quot;You should all pattern yourselves after Raff, for he excels in his training.  In fact, right now you should be feeling a burning sting of hatred for him because he makes all of you appear weaker and less worthy.  Raff deserves your hatred!”  Master Y’Ran grinned at Raff.  “Raff, your excellence drives your fellow students to improve themselves.  You are a child of Innoruuk now.”<br>
<br>
He turned his gaze from Raff and looked among the other students.  “Now, for motivation and reinforcement of what you have learned, you should all go and destroy someone weaker than yourselves.  It is the natural order of life and Hate that the weaker will be destroyed by the stronger.  Only the strong deserve to continue in Innoruuk’s world.”<br>
<br>
“I want you to all go into Nektulos and slay some of the disgusting halflings that often camp at the edge of our woods.  Today, only Raff shall be allowed to deliver the killing blow because he is the most worthy among you.  The rest of you may only render your enemies unconscious and offer them to Raff.”<br>
<br>
He turned to Raff again.  “Raff, I want you to develop your keen sense of hatred and rightness further, so you will only kill with a blade this day.  You may use magic to subjugate your foes, but I want you to experience the feelings of complete control and power over another being.  When the other students have rendered the halflings unconscious, they will tie them up and deliver them to you.  You will awaken them by whatever means necessary and then sacrifice them to Innoruuk.  You will make them beg for release before you kill them so that you and your fellow students can see the futility of pleading and how it arises from weakness and inferiority.”<br>
<br>
Raff sat still, his face emotionless.  His mind was screaming at him, urging him to run from the room, to leave Neriak and never return.  For the thousandth time since he began studying amongst the Dark elves he felt nauseous and feared he would vomit.  He swallowed slowly and clenched his fists tightly.  Somewhere in the distant corners of his mind, he knew he was slowly losing a battle for his sanity.<br>
<br>
“I will be nearby to witness the development of your skills.” Y’Ran unsheathed a long silver knife from a black scabbard on his belt and offered it to Raff. “Today you will use my own knife, Raff”  <br>
<br>
Raff took the knife obediently, and spoke quietly.  “I will use it for Innoruuk’s work Master.”<br>
<br>
Y’Ran spoke to the group.  Go forth and spread hatred, students of Innoruuk&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Master&quot; the group of students stood and responded in unison.  &quot;We go to do the Father's work&quot;<br>
<br>
The students left the room orderly, but quickly.  There were halflings to kill and torture. <br>

<br>
&quot;I secured it in the guild library last night before I retired.&quot;  Konkir sat in a chair before Dooly, his hands fidgeting at his sides, betraying his nervousness.<br>
<br>
Dooly rolled his eyes and sighed, pushing his tiny body back from the desk.  &quot;Why wasn't the library secured?  Why did you allow such a precious scroll to go missing?&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir glared at the gnome and pointed a slender finger at him.  &quot;I most certainly did make sure the library was secured, and don't you dare suggest it is my fault the scroll is lost!&quot; His voice was cracking.<br>
<br>
&quot;This isn't the first time you've blundered Konkir!  I remember a certain supply of malachite that went missing the day after...&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir leapt to his feet.  &quot;You know that wasn’t my fault!&quot;  His thin frame was shaking with rage as he squeaked his indignation.<br>
<br>
Dooly stood up and returned the glare across the desk, tapping his finger on the desk for emphasis.  &quot;I wasn't the last one to use it, and I wasn't the one who left the library unattended, so I figure that...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Enough!&quot;  Tara declared.  She had been sitting quietly in the other chair in the room listening to the two mages argue with each other since Konkir entered the room to inform Dooly of the missing scroll.  &quot;We have a problem, and we need a solution.  We do not need the two of you fighting like children.&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir breathed deeply, trying to calm himself.  Dooly scowled at Tara.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Sit down. Both of you,&quot; Tara repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;We need more than a solution. We need to make sure this doesn't start again so we should ...&quot; Dooly started.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said SIT DOWN!&quot; Tara roared.  Tara Necklene wasn’t about to let Dooly or anyone else ignore her commands.<br>
<br>
Dooly opened his mouth and closed it wordlessly.  His face was now bright red.  Tara narrowed her eyes and returned Dooly's stare.  After a moment he shrugged and sat down slowly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now,&quot; Tara began, &quot;which scroll are we talking about?  Is it an important one?&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir looked over at Dooly and then turned to Tara. &quot;It's the new scroll our expedition to Velious found.  As far as we can tell, it's a new summoning spell.   Something we've never seen before.&quot;  He shrugged.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's huge,” added Dooly, pursing his lips at Konkir for emphasis.  &quot;And now it's gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara glanced at Dooly, a warning in her brown eyes, and the gnome was silent.  &quot;So. It's important then.&quot;  Dooly nodded, resisting the urge to speak again.  &quot;Do we have a copy of the spell?&quot;  Tara asked, turning to Konkir.<br>
<br>
Konkir sighed and worked his hands nervously in his lap.  &quot;No.  We had just started deciphering it. It was written in Elder Dragon, and was extremely difficult to work on.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara steepled her fingers, placed her index fingers to her lips and thought for a moment.  &quot;Is there anyone who might know about this spell?  Somebody who would know we have it in our possession?&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir and Dooly looked at each other reflexively then dropped their eyes.  Tara watched them and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Well?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
Konkir looked up, his voice low. &quot;We have reason to believe the Dark Summoners in Neriak have taken this half.”<br>
<br>
Tara narrowed her eyes in confusion.  &quot;I'm sorry?  This half?  What does that mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
It was Dooly's turn to sigh.  &quot;The original spell was torn in two, supposedly in order to protect it's secret.  We’ve been working on the first half.  We believe the Teir'Dal managed to find out about the spell and steal it, and now that they have the first half, they’ll be after the second half.”<br>
 <br>
Tara cocked her head sideways slightly, a finger rubbing her lower lip lightly.  “And what gives you reason to suspect the Teir’Dal?<br>
<br>
“We were effectively in a race to reach the scroll in the first place.  When we arrived in Velious there was a Teir’Dal party already there, preparing for their exploration.  One of our party overheard the Dark Elves discussing a few of the possible locations for the scroll… the same locations we had discovered in our research,” Konkir explained.<br>
<br>
Dooly rubbed his bald temple and sighed.  “But we beat them to it!  And now the bastards managed to steal it from our own library.”  He sighed again and leaned back in his chair.  “And now… we only have half a spell.”<br>
<br>
Tara looked at Dooly and then Konkir.  “Where is the other half?”  She asked slowly.<br>
<br>
“Oh don’t worry about that, we’ve hidden it very carefully, and it’s under secure lock.”  Konkir replied.<br>
<br>
“How do you know it’s secure if the other half was stolen so easily?” Tara asked.<br>
<br>
“The first half was locked in the study area of the library because it was being researched.  We were only working on the first half, so the second half was, and is, safely stored in our vaults.  They’re too heavily protected for anyone to attempt a theft.  It would be suicide.” Konkir said confidently.<br>
<br>
“Then why the hell didn’t you store the first half in the vaults as well?”  Dooly accused, his eyes flashing at Konkir.<br>
<br>
“Dooly, be silent.  Your infantile accusations aren’t helping this situation.  You know very well material being researched isn’t placed in the vaults because it takes hours to safely remove the  protection spells.”  Tara’s look silenced any response the gnome considered. Instead he allowed a sour look to spread across his face as he folded his arms across his chest.<br>
<br>
Tara was silent while she considered the problem facing them.  “So, I take it the second half of the spell is useless without the first half?”  Konkir nodded.  “How far did you get on researching the spell Konkir?”<br>
<br>
“Not far enough to complete the spell with just the second half, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Konkir said.<br>
<br>
“So, we need the first half back.  Perhaps we can use the second half as a bargaining chip, and make a trade with the Dark Summoners then.”<br>
<br>
Konkir nodded.  “That might work.  They might go for that.”<br>
<br>
“That would mean the Teir’Dal would get a complete copy of the spell then”  Dooly complained.<br>
<br>
“Do you have a better solution Mr. Jonkers?”  Tara asked.  Dooly stared at Tara for a few moments and then sighed heavily.<br>
<br>
“As I thought.  So.  What are our options?”  Tara looked at Konkir.<br>
<br>
Konkir looked at his feet a moment and said quietly.  “Well, I suppose we could make a copy of the spell for them, but change a small piece to confuse them.  They would find out eventually, and solve the problem, but we might get a head start that way.”<br>
<br>
“A good suggestion.  Could you make a copy authentic looking enough to fool them?”  Tara asked.<br>
<br>
“I think so… it might take a while, but I think I could.”<br>
<br>
“But how do we contact the Dark Elves?  We haven’t had any contact with them for over a decade.  They’d kill any of us who attempted to contact them.  They’ve all but sworn to destroy anyone from the Academy.  And it’s almost impossible to hire a rogue these days to enter Neriak, and even if we could find one brave enough and skilled enough, they’d probably screw us over for more money.  You can’t trust anyone who associates with them.”  Dooly’s voice became more agitated as he talked.<br>
<br>
“I can think…” Konkir started.<br>
<br>
“True Dooly.  But we might have to resort to an extreme measure in this extreme circumstance” Tara noted.<br>
<br>
“I can think…” Konkir tried again.<br>
<br>
“Any Dark Elf would screw us.  Period!”  Dooly repeated.<br>
<br>
“I can think of someone who might be able to help us,” Konkir said quietly.<br>
<br>
“Yes Konkir?” Tara invited.<br>
<br>
“There’s someone who is attending the Dark Summoners right now, and I think he’d like to get out, and finish his training here at the Academy.  He’s not a Dark Elf, and I’ve heard he absolutely hates it in Neriak,” Konkir offered.<br>
<br>
Dooly’s eyes opened wide and his face flushed red.  “No!  Absolutely NOT!”  He waved his had and held it up toward Konkir.  “I will NOT have that bastard working for us – he’s nothing but a …<br>
<br>
“Fortunately, Dooly, it’s not your decision to make,” Tara interrupted.  <br>
<br>
Dooly scowled at Tara, his cheeks crimson.  “This is a terrible idea Necklene.  Mark my words,”  he was tapping on his desk again with his tiny index finger, emphasizing each word.  “We will regret this decision.”<br>
<br>
“Then it will be MY decision we regret,” Tara said, a finality in her voice that made Dooly realize the discussion was over.  She turned to look at Konkir.  “Send a message to Raff informing him that we wish to speak with him, and that it’s extremely important.”<br>
<br>
Dooly muttered under his breath and folded his arms again.<br>
<br>
“I will send the message immediately Tara,” Konkir said as he rose from his chair.<br>
<br>
“Good.  Inform me as soon as you receive word from him in any fashion.”  Tara rose from her chair.  “We are done here then.”<br>
<br>
Konkir followed Tara out and closed the door quietly behind them.  Dooly leaned back in his chair, turned his face to the ceiling, closed his eyes, and shook his head silently.<br>

Raff stood at the gates of Freeport, a crumpled note in his hand.  He stared into the distance at nothing in particular while he considered the possibilities his future might entail. What in hell do they want from me? He thought.  He looked down at the parchment in his hand, slowly opened it and for the twentieth time, read it.<br>
<br>
To Raff, onetime resident of Freeport, widow of Glorias:<br>
<br>
The Academy of Arcane Science requests your presence as soon as possible to discuss an urgent task.<br>
<br>
Although we have had tense relations in the past, the Academy wishes to start anew.<br>
<br>
We look forward to seeing you again.<br>
<br>
Raff crumpled the note in his fist and breathed deeply.  Whatever this is about, they must want it pretty damn badly to need someone who they couldn't associate with two years ago. On his way from Neriak to Freeport he had tried to think of what the Academy could want from him, a mere apprentice magician, but he couldn't think of anything he could do that could possibly interest them. Well, he thought, no time like the present, I suppose.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
As Raff entered the city, walking under the stone archway above the entrance to Freeport, a Dark Elf appeared suddenly just outside the gates directly in front of a city guard.  The guard’s head snapped toward the Dark Elf and he scowled.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you, and what business do you have in Freeport Teir'Dal?&quot; The guard spoke in a low gravely voice.<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf watched Raff disappear down a side street, his eyes never straying from him.<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Kezlat Human, and my business is none of your concern,&quot; he said while beginning to cast a spell. Three seconds later, he vanished.<br>
<br>
The last thing the guard saw of Kezlat was the beginnings of a broad smile spreading across his dark blue features.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Raff arrived at the Academy of Arcane Science after a short walk.  Two members greeted him as he walked through the large stone archway that marked the entrance.  Beyond the archway was a narrow street ending in a teleportation platform.  Raff stepped on the platform and immediately found himself inside the Academy facing two female members wearing purple robes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello Raff,&quot; the first woman spoke brightly &quot;It's so nice to see you again.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;I doubt it,” he said firmly.<br>
<br>
The woman blinked in confusion.  &quot;I'm sorry...?&quot; she said, more as a question than a statement of sorrow.<br>
<br>
Raff looked around casually, noticing some younger members having a discussion a few feet away.  &quot;I know as well as anyone I'm not wanted here, so don't insult me with your pretentious blathering.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman gaped at Raff, her mouth open in surprise. &quot;Well... I didn't mean to ... uh... blather... uh, I was just...”<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you've picked up some Teir'Dal habits Raff.  I hope you still have some feelings for your own race, my friend,” said a woman stepping forward from a stairway leading upward.  She walked forward with a confidence long nurtured in a position of authority. She bowed before Raff.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the habits you refer to are my ability to tell when someone's wasting my time with lies and pomp and my refusal to waste time, then you'd be correct. They're habits most humans would do well to learn.&quot;<br>
<br>
When the woman smiled at Raff he was instantly aware of her beauty. Her smile seemed to touch her brown eyes and Raff found he liked her.  &quot;I couldn't agree more Raff,&quot; she said lightly.  &quot;We could use a lot more candor in this place.  My name is Tara Necklene, and I'm one of the senior instructors here.&quot;  She bowed again.<br>
<br>
Raff found himself fighting the urge to bow.  &quot;What do you want with me?&quot; he asked coldly.<br>
<br>
Tara smiled again and glanced around the room.  &quot;Let's go up to my office.  I think we'll have more privacy there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara turned around and went up the stairs with Raff following her as she walked three flights up into the Academy. When she finally stopped on the third floor she paused and turned to Raff.  &quot;There are two more people I'd like you to meet.  Well, that's not entirely true; I believe you've met one of them before.&quot;  She walked down a short corridor and opened a door at the end, then motioned for Raff to enter. &quot;After you,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Raff entered the small room and glanced at the large wooden desk that dominated the office.  In front of the desk were three chairs, two of which were occupied. He paused momentarily as his eyes locked onto the gnome sitting in the chair furthest from the door.  He had no trouble remembering the gnome's name:  Dooly Jonkers.  &quot;I see the Academy still maintains a staff of arrogant bastards,&quot; he said as he stared at Dooly, his face impassive.  Dooly started to respond, but stopped, apparently thinking it wasn't the best time for comment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please Raff, have a seat.&quot; Tara motioned Raff forward, casually trying to break the tension.  As Raff moved toward the nearest chair she walked around the large desk and sat down behind it.  Raff went behind the closest chair but made no move to sit down.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please Raff, sit down,&quot; Tara repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather stand, thank you,” he said formally.<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish.&quot; She replied and smiled.  &quot;Allow me to introduce Konkir, our chief researcher here at the Academy.&quot;  Tara indicated Konkir with a wave of her hand and the thin man stood and bowed. Raff merely nodded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe you know Dooly here,&quot; she said nodding at Dooly.  &quot;Dooly is in charge of admissions and student relations.&quot;  Dooly glanced at Raff and licked his tiny lips, but didn't acknowledge him in any way.<br>
<br>
Raff looked at Tara and said, &quot;Yes, I've had the great displeasure of meeting him before.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara continued, unshaken by Raff's blunt comment.  &quot;Good.  We can begin then.  Now, to answer your question. Why are you here? The answer is both simple and complex, but since you seem like a man who prefers straightforward answers, I'll be brief.  Essentially we need you to act as a go-between for a small trade we need to do with the Dark Summoners of Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.  And what is the item to be traded?&quot; Raff's voice was calm and quiet.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a scroll, Raff.&quot;  Konkir's voice was high pitched, a perfect match to his frail build.  &quot;We have half of it, and the Dark Summoners stole the other half from our library.  We found the spell in two pieces in Velious a while back.&quot;  Konkir was speaking rapidly, his interest in the spell obvious.  &quot;It's quite and interesting spell, actually, and when we get both pieces back, it'll will be a great spell!  In fact...”<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you Konkir, that's all we need right now,&quot; Tara interrupted. She held her hands out in front of her, palms toward each other. &quot;So, all we need you to do is take a copy of our spell and trade it for a copy of the other half.  That way both guilds will have a copy of the spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff looked from Konkir to Tara. &quot;Why me?&quot; he asked quietly. Dooly muttered something under his breath.<br>
<br>
Tara shot a warning glance at Dooly and then turned back to Raff. &quot;To be honest Raff, you're the only one we could think of that might have sympathies for both the Teir'Dal and the Humans. Would you be willing to do this for us?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff stood silently for a while, looking at the others in the room. He sighed and slowly sat down in the chair Tara had offered before.  He rested his hands on the arms of the chair and looked up at the ceiling.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll do this for you on three conditions,&quot; he began.<br>
<br>
&quot;What three conditions?&quot;  Dooly spoke for the first time, his words dripping with condescension. &quot;Two bottles of wine and a mug of ale?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No... No, not that Dooly&quot; Raff stood up slowly and moved to Dooly's chair.  As he did, Dooly stood in response, his arms folding across his chest.  When Raff was directly before him Dooly's head came up to Raff's waist.<br>
<br>
&quot;What then Raff? Maybe two bottles of wine and a bar slut?” Dooly shrugged and chuckled. “Of course, you might be spoiled by now. I hear Neriak prostitutes excel in their craft.&quot;  Dooly laughed.<br>
<br>
Raff smiled at Dooly and then struck him hard across the face with a solid fist, his weight fully behind the blow, sending the tiny gnome flying into the chair and toppling both over.  Konkir and Tara jumped from their seats to intervene, but Raff calmly turned and moved back to his chair and sat down.<br>
<br>
Dooly scrambled to his feet, disentangling himself from the chair.  &quot;Why you stupid little bastard,&quot; he growled, his face bright red with anger.  &quot;What the hell was that for?&quot; He put his fingers to his lips and when he pulled them away they were bloody.<br>
<br>
&quot;That,&quot; Raff said calmly, &quot;Was condition number one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly glared at Raff but the human ignored him.  Konkir looked to Dooly and then to Tara, who sat down quickly, fighting the smile that had just started to form on her face.  Konkir watched Dooly sit down and then did so himself, a stunned expression on his face.  The gnome took a handkerchief from inside his robes and wiped his mouth gingerly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alright Raff, that's number one.  What are the other two conditions?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Second is that I get to learn the spell before I take it to Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Out of the question!&quot; Dooly said, his tiny fist thumping on the arm of his chair. He wiped his mouth again.<br>
<br>
Raff sat in his chair and spoke quietly.  &quot;That's what it's going to take for me to do this. If you want someone else, go ahead and get someone else, but if you want me to do it, I'm going to have access to the spell to learn it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ridiculous!&quot; Dooly affirmed.  &quot;There's no way he deserves to have access to such a rare and powerful spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Raff, I mean no offense,&quot; Konkir started, &quot;but I don't think you'd be able to understand it.  You simply don't have the skills yet. You might one day, but not now, I'm afraid.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That would be my problem, wouldn't it?&quot;  Raff said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dooly,&quot; Tara began, &quot;It's true. Raff probably won't be able to understand the spell anyway.  What harm would there be in allowing him to try learning it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly turned his eyes away from Tara and folded his arms. &quot;Either way, it's a bad idea,” he said, half mumbling to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Konkir, what realistic chance does Raff have of understanding the spell?&quot; Tara asked.<br>
<br>
Konkir thought a moment. &quot;Virtually none.&quot; He said. &quot;If he did manage to learn the spell he'd be the most gifted magician I've ever heard of. I'm quite sure the Dark Elves don't teach much differently than we do, and even if they did, the spell would still be greatly beyond his capabilities. I'm sure he couldn't even muster the mana to power the spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara nodded at Konkir and said, &quot;Very well then Raff, request granted. What is the third condition?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll need at least two full days undisturbed with the spell so I can work on learning it.&quot;  Raff said.<br>
<br>
&quot;That shouldn't be a problem.  Now, what is the third request?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to be paid 1000 platinum for my time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly snorted but remained silent.  Tara looked at him questioningly.  He waved his hand dismissively.  &quot;I really don't care how much we pay him,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
Tara looked at Konkir and he nodded.  &quot;Alright,&quot; she said, looking back at Raff. &quot;1000 platinum is fine. Do we have a deal now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff nodded and stood up. &quot;Yes. We have a deal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tara stood and moved around her desk to offer her hand to Raff. They shook hands briefly and she said, &quot;You can come by tomorrow morning and start learning the spell. The following day you may come back and continue. On the third day you will leave in the morning with our copy of the spell. When you return from Neriak with the other half, we'll pay you the money. How does that sound Raff?&quot; She asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's fine,&quot; he said and turned to leave. He opened the door and turned back to her. &quot;I'll be here at dawn tomorrow,&quot; he said, and then he walked out of the room, closing the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Tara leaned against her desk, her hands gripping the edge.  &quot;Comments?&quot; she asked.  Konkir shook his head.  Dooly remained silent.  &quot;Alright then, make sure you two have the copy ready for the day after tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir stood up and nodded. &quot;That won't be a problem Tara.  I'm almost finished a copy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good then. That's all for now.&quot;  She stood back up and walked around her desk to sit in her chair once again.  Konkir bowed and then left. Dooly stood and followed Konkir silently, closing the door behind him.<br>
<br>
If Dooly or Konkir had thought to look behind them as they walked back to their offices they might have noticed a slight movement of a few tapestries moments after they passed them.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Kezlat appeared from nothing a few feet from the entrance to the Academy of Arcane Science, chuckling quietly to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, dear Raff. You've managed to stumble on a new spell! Your luck is truly amazing, but it won't do you any good whatsoever.&quot; Kezlat chuckled again to himself. <br>
<br>
An elderly man dressed in a collection of rags and shreds of leather walked up to him.  &quot;Could ya spare some coppers?&quot; he asked obsequiously.<br>
<br>
Kezlat's smile grew into a large grin. &quot;Certainly I can, Human,&quot; Kezlat said brightly as he opened his belt pouch and removed a few copper coins. &quot;Here you are,&quot; he said as he handed the man a handful of coins.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you sir,&quot; the old man said, bowing deeply repeatedly. &quot;Much appreciated, it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man turned to leave just as Kezlat spoke again &quot;Oh, my, I forgot. There is something you could do for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The beggar turned back to Kezlat. &quot;Yes sir?&quot; he asked. &quot;What kin I do fer ya?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kezlat continued to grin as he placed his hand on the old man's shoulder. &quot;Oh, nothing really, something quite simple, in fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man looked at Kezlat with one eye. His other appeared badly damaged, perhaps in a fight in the distant past, and was now virtually immobile. The Elf could smell stale sweat, urine and alcohol in the old man's clothes and he noticed he had few teeth left. Kezlat removed his long knife from his belt, looked deeply into the old man’s good eye and spoke softly, &quot;Just one little thing, old man.&quot; He pulled the man's face to his chest firmly, burying his grizzled face in his thick robes, and put his lips close to his ear. &quot;Die for me,” Kezlat whispered.  He pressed the knife against the old man’s side and drove it in to the hilt, twisting it once he had it embedded fully.  The old man convulsed and tried to remove himself from Kezlat's grasp, but the Dark Elf held him tightly to his chest, smothering his attempts to cry out. He twisted the knife viciously in the man's side and held him tightly until he stopped struggling.<br>
<br>
He released the old man and allowed his body to fall to the ground. He bent and wiped his knife on the man's dirty clothes then replaced it in his belt. &quot;For you, Father Innoruuk,&quot; he said quietly as walked away.<br>

<br>
Kezlat sat quietly sipping a glass of wine in a secluded corner of the Blind Fish tavern. He was in a especially good mood tonight, even though he was out a few platinum he'd paid for the teleport to Nektulos forest.  Every once in a while, between sips, he chuckled out loud in spite of his efforts to remain silent.<br>
<br>
Another Dark Elf slipped into a chair across from him quietly, placing a mug of ale on the table. His long white hair and red eyes made him look remarkably similar to Kezlat, even though Kezlat looked much younger, lacking the maturity reflected in the other Elf's features.<br>
<br>
&quot;You wanted to speak to me?&quot; the second Elf asked gruffly.<br>
<br>
Kezlat smiled broadly. &quot;Yes, Zalar, I did. I am glad you came brother.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zalar frowned. &quot;Out with it Kezlat, I do not have time for Koada'Dal pleasantries.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you heard, dear brother, of a new spell acquired recently by the Dark Summoners? A spell originally from Velious, but most recently from the Academy of Arcane Science?&quot;  Kezlat spoke conspiratorially, his face still grinning.<br>
<br>
Zalar took a sip of ale, his face betraying no emotion. &quot;Perhaps. Why do you ask brother?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kezlat drew his finger along the rim of his wine glass slowly. &quot;Well, it just so happens I know somebody who will be carrying the second part of that particular spell from Freeport to Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zalar considered. &quot;And who is this person?&quot;<br>
<br>
Kezlat laughed darkly. &quot;My good friend Raff.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zalar raised an eyebrow.  Kezlat looked up from his wine glass, grinning, and nodded his head in response to his brother’s unspoken question.  The older Elf sucked at his lower lip and leaned back in his chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear the Commons are dangerous this time of year... anything could happen to someone traveling through on their way to Neriak.&quot; Now it was Zalar's turn to smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;The person who learned this spell would gain great respect among the Dark Summoners,&quot; Kezlat added.<br>
<br>
&quot;And after they learned the spell, they could sell its secrets for a premium, I would suspect.&quot; Zalar took another drink of ale. &quot;When?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Two days from now. I will meet him in the commons and persuade him to donate the scroll to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Will you kill him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, that might cause complications.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Complications? How?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As an official member of our guild, he has had his spirit bound in Neriak. If I killed him, he would most likely be resurrected in Neriak before I returned. Even though it would cost him a great deal of money, there are those loyal to him in the guild that would offer to pay. I do not need to remind you that there are many who believe he will become a powerful magician, and thus wish to keep him in their fold.&quot; Kezlat placed his hands on the table palms down. &quot;No, as much as I wish to destroy Raff, this is not the best time. It would be better if I just allowed him to return to Neriak on his own.&quot; He smiled at his brother again. &quot;That way you can learn the spell before he returns, and then we can present it to Master T'Rald.&quot;<br>
<br>
Zalar drank deeply from his mug and sat back thoughtfully, rubbing his temple absently. After a few moments he looked at Kezlat and nodded. &quot;Yes, I think, brother, that you will do the name of K'Rin proud with this plan.&quot; He reached forward for the mug, drained it in one swallow, and then stood up, pushing his chair behind him. &quot;I will secure a copy of the second half tonight and begin studying it. Notify me immediately when you return to Neriak with the other half.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kezlat watched as his brother left. He sipped slowly at his wine, savoring the wine's flavor and his own brilliance.<br>

<br>
&quot;If you need anything, I'll be in the main room.&quot; Konkir said as he stood by the door to the private reading room.  <br>
<br>
Raff sat down at the large desk and laid out the scroll using two polished paper weights on each end to keep it flat. &quot;Thank you Konkir. I should be fine though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; Konkir said as he closed the door.<br>
<br>
Raff got up and moved to the door. He placed a large bar across it, effectively securing it from outside entry. The room was windowless, and thus protected from prying eyes. He went to the desk and pushed the large scroll to one side, retrieved a tightly folded scroll from inside his breaches, unfolded it and placed it beside the other scroll. He also put an inkpot and a sharpened quill beside the scrolls, and brought one of the magical light sources closer to the desk. When all was arranged properly he sat down and began the arduous task that would consume the next two days.<br>
<br>
Even a cursory look at the scroll told Raff t hat he didn't have a chance of understanding it. He recognized some words and symbols, but the scroll's deeper meanings were lost to him. That didn’t matter to him, however, because he’d never intended to learn the spell. He knew it was beyond him at this time, but he also knew that one day it would be well within his abilities. His plan was to have the scroll available to him when that day arrived.<br>
<br>
So, with the future in mind, he began the painstaking task of copying the scroll out word for word, symbol for symbol. It was extraordinarily difficult work because he didn't even recognize some of the symbols in the spell, so he had to copy them as perfectly as possible. He worked non-stop for the entire day and after ten hours he’d copied over half of the spell and the smaller scroll he'd been writing on was full on both sides.<br>
<br>
He rose and stretched slowly. His wrist ached painfully and he rubbed it lightly. He spread some drying sand on the scroll to prevent the ink form blotting, folded it carefully and then placed it back inside his breaches where it couldn’t be seen. After the scroll was safely hidden away he rolled up the original and placed it back in its case.<br>
<br>
He removed the brace from the door, and left the room, massaging his wrist absently. He called out for Konkir and was startled to see the slender human standing three feet away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, you are done?&quot; Konkir asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, for the day. I'll be back tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Any luck?<br>
<br>
&quot;No, not really.” Raff sighed in feigned frustration. “I can understand some of it, but most is completely unintelligible to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir nodded his head. &quot;I expected as much Raff. Really, I don't think we would have let you in there if we thought you could really learn it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, I figured so. But you can't fault me for trying, can you? Raff laughed lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Raff. Perhaps you'll be a good librarian some day. You seem to have the patience for it.&quot; Konkir smiled kindly.<br>
<br>
Raff laughed again. &quot;A librarian? Somehow I can't see myself as a librarian, Konkir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you'd be surprised Raff. You never know.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raff nodded. &quot;No, I suppose you're right Konkir. I'd never have guessed I'd be studying to be a magician in Neriak either, so who knows?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Well, goodnight Konkir. I'll see you tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Goodnight Raff,&quot; Konkir said as he walked into the room where Raff had been working. He went to the case where the scroll was kept, opened it quickly, and removed the scroll so he could inspect it.<br>
<br>
He heard Raff's voice coming from across the library &quot;Don't worry Konkir, it's still there.&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir smiled as he examined the scroll carefully. When he was positive it hadn't been tampered with in any way, he rolled it up and placed it back in its case. Once the scroll was secured he left the room and closed the door, making sure all the locks were in place.<br>

<br>
Dooly looked up from his desk as Konkir entered the room. He leaned back in his chair and watched the frail man close the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot; Dooly asked. &quot;Is the copy prepared?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Dooly,&quot; Konkir said as he sat down across from the gnome. &quot;Everything is ready now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And? Did you make the changes we discussed?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Dooly. The spell will still function, but not the way it was intended.&quot;  Konkir rubbed his hands nervously.<br>
<br>
&quot;And? Just what exactly will the spell do now?&quot;  Dooly sat up in his chair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, as we discussed, I re-wrote the second half of the spell to summon a creature without the control. I'm pretty sure it'll work, but I was working from memory of the first spell, so I'm not positive.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly rolled his eyes in disgust. &quot;I don't want excuses, I want an explanation.  What exactly will the spell do?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well...&quot; Konkir started.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assuming you've recalled the first part correctly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... it should summon a powerful creature, just like it should, but now, if my changes are correct, the summoner won't have control of the creature.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly smiled. &quot;And what can we expect a creature will do under these circumstances?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... it really depends ... I mean, if you summon a beetle or some other non-aggressive creature, then probably nothing. But... if you summon an aggressive creature, for instance a bear, then that creature, the bear, will act as it normally would.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And it will attack the summoner, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's quite possible Dooly, yes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Excellent Konkir. You've done well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir smiled weakly and looked down at his hands. &quot;Thanks Dooly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly waved his hand casually, and then leaned his elbows on his small desk.  &quot;Now. What about Raff?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can he learn that spell?&quot;<br>
<br>
Konkir shook his head. &quot;I really can't see how he could, Dooly. I mean, he's just barely learned to summon food and water. He only knows the very basics of summoning and he has no idea how to summon elementals.&quot;  Konkir shook his head again. &quot;No, I just can't see it Dooly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dooly smiled and leaned back in his chair again, placing his hands behind his head. &quot;Good. Anything else to report?&quot; Konkir shook his head. &quot;Good. I'll let you get back to your library then.<br>
<br>
Konkir nodded, stood up and walked out.  Dooly watched him leave and then closed his eyes, a broad smile creeping across his face.  He sighed happily, the sigh of someone who has just completed an important task well. <br>

<br>
Tara handed the small metallic cylinder to Raff. “Here’s a copy of the scroll Raff. We’ll pay you the one thousand platinum when you return with the other half.” Tara smiled at Raff, her expression comforting. “Are you set to go?” she asked.<br>
<br>
Raff accepted the scroll case and examined it while he spoke. “Yes Tara, I think I’m ready.” He turned the case over in his hand. It was shiny, perhaps made of steel, he thought, and he could see his warped reflection in it’s curved surface when he held it before him. The image was a grotesque-looking man with an enormous head and arms that disappeared into tiny sticks as they went further from his body.<br>
<br>
“Were you able to learn anything from the original?” Tara asked.<br>
<br>
Raff was staring intently at the scroll case. One end was completely sealed off, the metal rounded perfectly. The other end had a lid made of the same metal on it, but it was covered with some type of waxy substance.<br>
<br>
“Raff?”<br>
<br>
Raff looked up from the cylinder and blinked. “Sorry?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Tara laughed lightly. “I asked you if you learned anything from the original scroll.” She smiled again.<br>
<br>
“Oh,” Raff replied and looked down at the scroll case again. “No,” he said. “I didn’t really. It was too hard for me to make anything of it.” He ran his finger along the waxy ring on the scroll case. “What’s this?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“The seal? That’s a wax seal Raff. It’s so the Dark Summoners know the scroll hasn’t been tampered with.” She took the case from Raff and turned it halfway around until an impression in the wax could be seen. “You see?” She pointed at the impression. “That’s our guild insignia.”<br>
<br>
Raff nodded. “That makes sense.” He took the case back from her and placed it in his backpack carefully. “Is there anything else I need?” <br>
<br>
“No Raff. That’s all you need. There’s a letter inside explaining what we want in return for this scroll.”<br>
<br>
Raff pulled his backpack on and tightened the straps. “Well, I suppose I should get going then. I have a long trip ahead of me, and you want your scroll back as soon as possible.”<br>
<br>
Tara smiled again. “Good journey to you Raff. I hope we’ll see you again soon.”<br>
<br>
Raff simply nodded and then walked out of her office. Ten minutes later he was at the gates of Freeport, and on his way to Neriak.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raff stopped to rest after a few hours on the road. He wasn’t particularly tired, but his curiosity was getting the best of him. He knelt down by the side of the road, placing his backpack in front of him, and retrieved a flask of water and a slice of fresh bread. As he chewed on the bread he pulled the scroll case from his pack and examined it again. His fingers traced along the waxy impression slowly and he chewed thoughtfully. What did they write to the Dark Summoners? He contemplated. Perhaps something like ‘please kill this messenger because he knows too much’? If there was one thing Raff had learned in his 39 years in Norrath, it was to never, ever trust anyone. He couldn’t trust the Summoners, and he certainly couldn’t trust the Academy. Sighing heavily, he allowed his fingernail to scrape the wax impression off the cylinder. The red wax peeled and flaked as he pressed along the rim. He put the last bit of bread in his mouth and, grabbing the cylinder with both hands, twisted the lid off. Reaching into the case, he pulled out a thick tube of paper and carefully rolled it open. As he did, another scroll slipped out and landed on the grass. The larger scroll was the spell itself, and the smaller one appeared to be the letter Tara had mentioned. Raff put the scroll case down on the larger scroll and opened the smaller one. He was almost afraid to read it, fearing what it might say.<br>
<br>
For the Dark Summoners<br>
<br>
On behalf of the Freeport Academy of Arcane Science, I wish to offer the Dark Summoners a trade. We are well aware that you have in your possession the first half of a previously unknown spell. This spell was taken from our private library a short time ago. We are well aware that it is now in your possession.<br>
<br>
Inside the scroll case you will find the second half of this scroll. We offer this to you with the understanding that you will offer us in return the first half. We further understand that you have no reason to return the first half of the scroll to us, so we have rendered this half of the spell useless. There are a few key parts missing. There is no doubt that you will, in time, decipher the scroll and determine the missing elements. However, if you were to return the first part of the scroll to us, we will supply the correct scroll in its entirety. If you should choose to keep both halves, you will undoubtedly be closer to complete understanding, but still considerably distant.<br>
<br>
I am sure, when you consider the alternatives, you will agree to return the scroll to us.<br>
<br>
Tara Necklene, on behalf of the Freeport Academy of Arcane Science<br>
<br>
Raff laughed lightly and shook his head. One day these people are going to drown in their own deceit and subterfuge he thought. He grabbed at another piece of bread and flask of water and lay down on the cool grass, the letter still in his hand. As he ate, he lay deep in thought, slowly tapping the letter against his leg. He popped the last bit of bread into his mouth and washed it down with some water. Getting up, he brushed some breadcrumbs from his tunic, and, folding the note up tightly, placed it in his backpack. He reached into his breaches, retrieved the scroll he’d carefully copied down, opened it up, and placed it beside the one he was supposed to offer as a trade and sat down again. The symbols meant no more to him today than they did two days ago, but he placed a finger on each scroll and carefully traced his way along the writings, comparing one to the other. It took him over half an hour before he found any discrepancy in the first scroll. He wasn’t able to discern what it meant, but he could tell there was a significant change – much more than just a few symbols.<br>
<br>
He was about to throw away the incorrect scroll when something made him stop. He couldn’t quite place the feeling, but something told him to keep the first scroll. He considered his options for a while, running his fingers through his moustache as he thought. Finally, he took the Academy’s scroll and placed it back in the scroll tube without the letter and then spent a few moments removing all traces of the wax seal from the shiny metal before he put the case back in his pack. He folded the letter up with the scroll he’d copied and returned it to his breaches. Standing up, he slung his backpack over his shoulder and looked down the road, into the distance. Looking at the sky, he figured there was another six hours of daylight from the position of the sun in the sky. He drained his flask and continued on his journey.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raff watched the sun as it was fading on the horizon, bringing darkness with it. He had stopped a little over half an hour earlier to make camp by the side of the road. His little fire was burning down so he placed a few dry branches on top of it and watched the flames lick hungrily along the wood. The new branches cracked and spat in protest. As he emptied a flask of water into a small pot he heard a footstep nearby, the telltale snap of a twig. He dropped the pot, leapt to his feet and turned to face the noise, his hand falling on his dagger. The unmistakable shiver of magic fluttered through him and his feet were rooted to the ground where he stood. He overbalanced and fell to his hands and knees, his feet unmoving.<br>
<br>
“Well, well, well. If it isn’t my good friend Raff”<br>
<br>
Raff looked up to see a large irregularly shaped conglomeration of earth and rock floating inches from his face, flexing its stony arms. He struggled to stand up but the end of a staff pressed to his back pushed him back down.<br>
<br>
“Kezlat,” Raff said as he twisted around to see his attacker, trying to get to his feet again. “Didn’t I kill you once already?”<br>
<br>
A brown blur flashed before Raff’s eyes just before he felt the boot strike his head. He fell to the ground again, bright flashes of light exploding in his eyes. He felt blood flowing from his nose.<br>
<br>
“Human Dog!” Kezlat snarled as he grabbed Raff’s hair, yanking his head back painfully. “You have no idea how close you are to death,” he hissed. “It would take but a word from me and my elemental will kill you instantly.”<br>
<br>
Raff’s voice was hoarse. “Still can’t to do your own dirty work, huh Kezlat?” He coughed. “So, how much do you still owe for your last resurrection? I bet daddy wasn’t very happy with you at all, was he?”<br>
<br>
Kezlat swore and slammed Raff’s face into the gravel of the road. “If I had the time, Human, I’d show you how well I do my dirty work, but I have a scroll to deliver.”<br>
<br>
Raff coughed again and lifted himself slowly to his arms. He could only open one eye, and through it, saw blood on the gravel below him. “What scroll are you talking about?” he asked weakly. He could hear Kezlat going through his backpack.<br>
<br>
“Don’t presume I am as stupid as you Human. I know very well what scroll you carry.” <br>
<br>
Raff heard Kezlat move toward him, and then saw the Dark Elf’s feet before him. “This scroll, fool,” Kezlat said as he squatted down in front of Raff. He grabbed Raff’s hair and pulled his head back roughly, causing Raff to grunt in pain. With his other hand he held out the scroll tube. Raff could see his reflection in the tube, but this time he could barely recognize his blood and gravel covered face. <br>
<br>
“This scroll will bring back much honor to house K’Rins!” Kezlat exclaimed. <br>
<br>
Kezlat shoved Raff’s face into the gravel again and stood up. “Thank you, my dear friend, for going through the trouble to get this for me,” he sneered as he walked away. “Oh, my!” he said brightly, then stopped and turned back to Raff. “I almost forgot! You should have a nice long rest, so you don’t get any silly ideas and try to get this scroll back.” He waved his hand and a guttural noise came from the elemental beside Raff. It floated to him and began clubbing Raff with its rocky fists.<br>
<br>
For Raff, darkness came before the sun was down.<br>

<br>
“Brother, it is good to see you,” Kezlat smiled.<br>
<br>
Zalar looked up from the scroll he was studying, a dubious expression on his face. “Save the pleasantries for your dealings with the Koada’Dal, Kezlat.” He pushed a few stray hairs away from his face and narrowed his red eyes at his brother. “Do you have the scroll?” he said gruffly.<br>
<br>
Kezlat continued to smile. “Yes, brother, I do.” He held out the scroll case.<br>
<br>
“Good. I’ve learned all I need to learn from this one.” He reached out a hand toward Kezlat, his gaze returning to the scroll before him. “Give me the second half.”<br>
<br>
Kezlat pulled the cylinder away from his brother’s hand, tapping it lightly against the palm of his other hand. “I am wondering what you have said to master T’Rald, Zalar.” Zalar looked up slowly, his red eyes flashing anger. “I have heard rumors.” Kezlat continued. “Rumors that suggest you have neglected to mention my part in acquiring this scroll when you have spoken to our Masters.”<br>
<br>
Zalar narrowed his eyes. “What does it matter Kezlat? You are in my house, we share status and power equally.”<br>
<br>
Kezlat frowned in mock disappointment. “But, brother dear, you know as well as I do that it does not always work that way.”<br>
<br>
Zalar slammed his hands on his desk and stood, his face twitching in anger. “Foolish child!” he spit furiously. “I could destroy you with a wave of my hand!” He pounded his fist on his desk to emphasize his point. “Now give me the scroll before I prove it to you!”<br>
<br>
Kezlat smiled calmly and sat down in the chair opposite his brother’s desk. “Oh, I don’t think you will do such a thing brother,” he said with a half-chuckle. “Not when you do not know where the scroll is.” He twisted the top of the scroll case off and tossed the case onto the desk casually.<br>
<br>
Zalar snatched the case from his desk and looked inside. His eyes returned to Kezlat an instant later. His brother smiled brightly at his glare. He dropped the case back onto the desk and sat down slowly, considered the grinning Elf across the desk. Slowly a smile crept into Zalar’s face and he threw back his head and laughed. “Well, brother, perhaps you will one day earn the right to call yourself a K’Rins!” he said as he laughed. “Where is the scroll?”<br>
<br>
“It is in a safe place,” replied Kezlat. “And once I have been given the credit I deserve, it is all yours.”<br>
<br>
Zalar folded his arms, smiling. “Very well, brother. Let us go and see Master T’Rald.” He rose and moved to the door, opening it for his brother. “After you brother,” he said pleasantly.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raff wakened with a groan and slowly pulled himself into a sitting position. His head was pounding insistently and when he took a ragged breath he coughed painfully. It hurt to breath. Running his hand along his face, he felt a mass of dried blood mixed with dirt, gravel and hair. He looked around for his backpack and saw it a few feet from him. Unable to summon the strength to stand, he pulled himself along the ground. Dragging his body the five feet to his pack.  Once there, he reached inside, looking for a flask of water. When he found one he rolled over onto his back and opened it. He took a small sip, swallowing with difficulty and then poured some water on his face, wincing in pain as the water washed away some of the dried blood and exposed his wounds to the air. He let his hand fall to the ground and drifted into blackness again.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
“Master T’Rald, it is good of you to see us,” Zalar said as he bowed before T’Rald. Kezlat mimicked his brother, bowing in deep respect.<br>
<br>
T’Rald stood before them, his hands folded calmly at his waist. “I trust that you have good reason to disturb me?”<br>
<br>
Zalar licked his lips and straightened. “Yes Master. My brother and I have discovered an important piece of lore that will bring great power to the Dark Summoners.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald looked curious. “Indeed? What is this great power that you speak of Zalar?”<br>
<br>
“We have managed to obtain a copy of the second half of the new summoning spell our researchers have been working on.” Kezlat said, beating out Zalar.<br>
<br>
“And,” Zalar interrupted Kezlat, “I have mastered the spell in its entirety,” he said with obvious pride.<br>
<br>
“And what does this have to do with me, Zalar?”<br>
<br>
“We wish to demonstrate the power of this spell to you first, before any other Summoner, Master T’Rald. We wish to bring honor to you, as your students,” Zalar explained.<br>
<br>
Kezlat spoke up. “And Zalar will demonstrate this new spell tomorrow morning, for your satisfaction, if you wish Master.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald looked at both of them carefully, as if determining the level of truth in their proposal. “Where and when?” he asked.<br>
<br>
“Tomorrow at noon, Master,” Kezlat said. “In the commons, at the edge of our forest.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald nodded silently. “Very well. Tomorrow at noon, in the commons. I will be there.” He turned to leave and then paused. “I trust you will not waste my time,” he said, his voice threatening, then turned and walked away.<br>
<br>
Kezlat grinned at his brother. “Now, let us go get the scroll that will allow bring pride back to our name, good brother.” Kezlat walked away briskly.<br>
<br>
Zalar scowled and followed his brother silently.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raff woke to a stabbing pain in his head. Bright sunlight stabbed into his open eye from the sun overhead. He lay on his back for a good twenty minutes, trying to remember where he was, and what he was doing lying on the side of a road. Slowly his memory sifted back into his consciousness and he struggled to get to his knees. He picked up a flask of water lying on the ground beside where he had been sleeping and drained what was left of it. Slowly, agonizingly, he lifted himself to his feet, his breath coming in painful gasps. Grimacing, he lifted his backpack onto his shoulders and looked down the road before him with one eye. Grunting in pain, he started walking toward the Nektulos forest.<br>

<br>
Kezlat paced nervously. “Do you have it Zalar?” he asked impatiently.<br>
<br>
“Shut up Kezlat,” Zalar growled. “I cannot concentrate with your childish gibbering” He was sitting cross-legged on the ground, staring at a large scroll in his lap.<br>
<br>
Kezlat looked at the sky nervously. By his estimation it was nearly noon. T’Rald would be coming very soon. He continued pacing back and forth, working his hands nervously as he did. He muttered something incoherently to himself.<br>
<br>
Abruptly Zalar rolled up the scroll and stood up. “I am done,” he announced.<br>
<br>
“Are you sure, brother? Do you know it for sure?”<br>
<br>
“Kezlat, do not anger me. I am in an excellent mood this day, and I do not wish to spend my time throttling you.” He looked at the sun, glowing hotly in the sky. “Master T’Rald should be here any moment,” he said thoughtfully.<br>
<br>
Kezlat grinned evilly. “Yes! And soon the house of K’Rins will rise to its proper place of power!” His eyes were distant as he fantasized about their future. He was snapped out of his reverie by Zalar’s announcement.<br>
<br>
“Here he comes Kezlat. Regain your wits. He turned toward his brother and snarled, “And this time, do not speak!”<br>
<br>
Kezlat scowled at his brother, but remained silent. Zalar waved his hand at the two figures approaching. A few moments later T’Rald and another Dark Elf arrived. Zalar and Kezlat bowed deeply before them.<br>
<br>
“Master T’Rald, how pleasant to see you,” Zalar said. “I trust your trip did not take too long?”<br>
<br>
T’Rald waved his hand dismissively. “Fuulik here was generous enough to teleport me nearby, thus my walk was short. However, the greatest threat to my time is you and your demonstration. I trust you are ready, and I will not be kept waiting with idle talk.”<br>
<br>
Zalar bowed again and said “I am ready Master, and I believe you will be impressed with the power of this spell.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald raised an eyebrow at Zalar. “Indeed? What is it that you plan to accomplish with this spell?”<br>
<br>
“We magicians are considered by all to be the masters of summoning,” he said as he swept his arm at the sky with a flourish. “But our summoning is limited in many ways. For instance, we are able to summon only four types of elementals to command.” He paused and held up a finger. “But now, I have the power to summon any creature I choose, and become its master instantly!”<br>
<br>
T’Rald glanced at Fuulik and shrugged. “Very well, Zalar, please demonstrate for us.”<br>
<br>
Zalar nodded and held his hands out from his sides. “Now I shall call upon a great beast of the air, the griffon, and, if one is near, it shall become mine to command!” He closed his eyes and was still for a moment, as if in concentration. Then he began to move his hands slowly. Lines of living magic, balls of colored light, began to coalesce around his hands and flow into his body, emanating in a circular pattern around him.<br>
<br>
Kezlat looked on, a broad grin on his face.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
Raff moaned painfully as he gingerly pulled his backpack off his right arm. His face was a purple swollen mass of bruises, caked with dried blood. Wearily, he poured water into a basin and dipped a cloth into it. He began dabbing the cloth to his face, watching carefully in a mirror on his nightstand. His eye was swollen shut, and ached painfully. “Why is it,” he said to no one in particular, “that even when I’ve been sober for years, I still manage to get beat up?” He rinsed the cloth in the basin and placed it on the rim where it could dry properly, then carefully removed his tunic and breaches. After he replaced them with clean clothes, he took the scroll he’d copied in his hand and left his tiny room, heading toward Master T’Rald’s offices.<br>
<br>
The trip to T’Rald’s offices was a short one, from Raff’s small apartment in the dormitories. Three flights of stairs and one short passage later found him standing outside T’Rald’s office. Even though he was a powerful magician and a highly respected teacher, T’Rald preferred to work out of a small office near the campus. Raff had heard that his residence was extraordinarily opulent and more like a mansion than a house, but he’d never been near it.<br>
<br>
“Master T’Rald is not in his office at this time,” a younger female Teir’Dal said as Raff entered. She smiled pleasantly, and Raff couldn’t help pondering the benefit of wealth and power in the Dark Elf society. Her clothes, if they could be called that, barely covered the essential areas.<br>
<br>
“When do you expect him to return?” Raff asked.<br>
<br>
“He said he would be back within the hour,” she replied. “If you wait here, though, I can let him know you’re here when he returns.” She smiled again and shifted her hips seductively. “Who should I say is calling on him?”<br>
<br>
“Raff. I am a student of his.”<br>
<br>
She smiled again. “Oh yes, Raff, I have heard about you.” She tilted her head slightly and giggled. “Does your face always look like that?”<br>
<br>
Raff sat down wearily, wondering how unpleasant his wait would be.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Zalar was surrounded by swirling strands of liquid light – the living form of a spell as it undulated around his body. At once all the glowing balls and wisps of light entered him and his body shimmered amidst a bright glow. The glow pulsed  and then ebbed. Instantly a massive creature, half lion with the wings and head of a bird appeared before him. It flapped its powerful wings, forcing a massive blast of air at the four Dark Elves. From a beak larger than a human head came a shrill piercing cry that nearly deafened Zalar as he stood directly in front of the beast. He turned his back to the griffon and bowed in triumph. “And, now you know the true power of this spell,” he shouted, barely audible over the griffon’s squawking and the drum of its wings.<br>
<br>
Kezlat moved beside his brother, his face etched with obvious pride. Zalar looked at his brother and raised his hand to place it on Kezlat’s shoulder. It never made it to his shoulder.<br>
<br>
With a horrible screech the griffon grasped Zalar’s forearm in its beak and shook its head violently. The sickening crack of breaking bones pulled Kezlat out of his reverie and he turned in time to see his brother’s arm dangling lifeless at his side as the huge beast landed on the Elf, knocking him to the ground, its powerful talons deeply embedded in the Dark Elf’s shoulders. Zalar screamed until the griffon grasped his neck in its powerful beak, crushing it. Kezlat watched in horror as the creature strained its powerful muscles and pulled up on his brother’s head, ripping it from the Elf’s body like a raven feeding on a dead animal. Kezlat screamed and ran at the griffon, blind with rage. It moved with amazing speed, considering its size, and gored him with its claws, ripping a deep, bloody gash across his chest from his neck to his groin. Kezlat fell unconscious as the bird grasped him in its beak.<br>
<br>
Once Kezlat was dead, the bird turned in the air to face the remaining two Dark Elves. The time it had taken the bird to kill the two brothers was enough time for Master T’Rald and Fuulik to prepare themselves. T’Rald had summoned an elemental and ordered it to attack the griffon. Once it had engaged, Fuulik began to draw upon the immense magical powers at his disposal and struck the bird moments later with an intensely cold blast of magical ice. The creature fell within seconds.<br>
<br>
T’Rald and Fuulik walked up to the two dead brothers and determined that Kezlat was dead. His brother didn’t require any confirmation greater than his head lying five feet away from his body. T’Rald shook his head and frowned. “Thus the way of fools is a road well traveled,” he said quietly. Fuulik also shook his head.<br>
<br>
“They will be resurrected?” he asked.<br>
<br>
T’Rald nodded. “Yes, their family has a small amount of wealth.”<br>
<br>
“Should we carry the bodies back to Neriak then?”<br>
<br>
T’Rald shook his head. “No. Let them walk here and learn a lesson.” He looked thoughtful. “Although, I believe these two do not learn with any rapidity whatsoever.”<br>
<br>
Fuulik laughed. “Shall we return then?”<br>
<br>
“I do not see any reason to remain here,” T’Rald said, shrugging slightly.<br>
<br>
Fuulik started casting a portal spell to return the two to the Nektulos forest.<br>

<br>
“So,” the young Dark Elf asked, kneeling at Raff’s feet, “is it true what they say about older humans?”<br>
<br>
Raff frowned at the young Elf. “You mean that we get gray hair?” he asked. <br>
<br>
She giggled. “No silly!” She ran a finger down Raff’s arm lightly and lowered her voice. “I’ve heard that you humans get more durable.”<br>
<br>
Raff looked at her finger on his arm. “What on Norrath are you talking about?” He folded his arms, putting an end to her touches.<br>
<br>
She pouted teasingly. “I heard you humans can last longer, you know, in bed, as you get older.” She lowered her head and looked at him from behind veiled eyes. “Is it true?”<br>
<br>
Raff groaned internally. “Yes, of course it’s true,” Raff said confidently. “In fact, most of us charge more as we age.”<br>
<br>
“Charge more?” the girl asked, the sultry tones in her voice instantly gone.<br>
<br>
“Yep,” Raff answered matter-of-factly. “Actually, we often charge more for younger people too. I would have to charge someone as young as you quite a bit for any sexual services.”<br>
<br>
Her eyes grew wide, and then narrowed. “You would charge me?” she said in disbelief. “You would charge me?” she repeated, louder.<br>
<br>
“Well yes,” Raff said with mock surprise. “What did you think?”<br>
<br>
“What did I think?” she sputtered and stood angrily. “How dare you!” She stomped back to her desk in the corner of the room. “Just for that,” she said flippantly over her shoulder, “I’ve just doubled my price, for you!”<br>
<br>
Raff looked at her, his face frozen in astonishment. “You mean you wanted me to pay you? Oh well, I’m sorry,” he said slowly, emphasizing the words, “I just assumed, since I’m an older human, that you’d be wanting to hire me.” He paused, as if considering. “Well, I suppose, also because of your looks.”<br>
<br>
“What about my looks?” she spat, her eyes narrowing in anger.<br>
<br>
“Oh, nothing,” Raff said off-handedly. “Just forget I said anything.”<br>
<br>
She scowled at him furiously. “What about my looks, human?”<br>
<br>
The door opened before Raff could respond.<br>
<br>
“Cyrindl,” Master T’Rald said as he entered the room. “Are you fighting with my students again?”<br>
<br>
The girl’s demeanor changed instantly, going from an aggressive, angry woman, to a meek child. “No Master,” she said as she lowered her head, averting her eyes from T’Rald. “We were just having a … a discussion about… about hate.” She looked over at Raff, her eyes flashing angrily. “Raff is here to see you.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald glanced at Raff, a small smile forming on his lips. “Raff. What brings you here to see me?”<br>
<br>
“A small matter you might be interested in Master,” Raff said bowing deeply.<br>
<br>
“Indeed? Well then, come into my office,” he said, gesturing to the other door in the small room.<br>
<br>
Raff stood up and followed T’Rald into his office. After he closed the door, he glanced around while Master T’Rald took a seat behind a large wooden desk. The room was opulently appointed, with elaborately carved polished wood bookshelves on all four walls. Raff easily recognized many common symbols of Innoruuk and the religion of Hate carved into the bookshelves. T’Rald indicated a large leather chair in front of the desk with his hand. “Sit, Raff.”<br>
<br>
Raff sat down and wondered if he’d be able to leave it, considering how easily his body sunk into its soft cushions. The door opened and Cyrindl entered carrying a small tray with two glasses of brandy. She placed them both on T’Rald’s desk and left silently. T’Rald watched her appreciatively as she left.<br>
<br>
“She is short on brains, but long on legs, is she not?” T’Rald asked.<br>
<br>
“I’ve seen more intelligent spiders,” Raff replied.<br>
<br>
T’Rald laughed. “And I suppose they are also long on leg, are they not?”<br>
<br>
Raff laughed lightly. “Yes, I suppose they are.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald reached for one of the glasses on the desk, nodding toward Raff, indicating he should do the same. He took a long sip and returned the glass to the desk. T’Rald looked at Raff’s glass. “Is there something wrong with my brandy?”<br>
<br>
“Although I’m sure your brandy is excellent, Master, I do not drink.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald pursed his lips, examining the human carefully. “Well then, Raff. What was it you wished to speak to me about?”<br>
<br>
Raff thought for a moment, and then said, “I’ve managed to obtain a new magic spell from the Freeport Academy of Arcane Science. I’m not skilled enough to interpret it completely, but, I understand that it allows the caster to summon another creature to control.”<br>
<br>
T’Rald frowned. “It doesn’t work Raff.”<br>
<br>
Raff blinked. “Pardon, Master? It doesn’t work? But… how could you know?”<br>
<br>
“I have seen the spell being cast, Raff. Not more than one hour ago, I witnessed Zalar casting this spell you speak of.” He narrowed his eyes and reached for the glass of brandy. “It failed somewhat spectacularly.”<br>
<br>
Raff shook his head, puzzled. “That doesn’t make any sense … I just got the spell two days before. I’m the only one who has it, except …” Raff’s eyes grew wide and a smile began to creep into his bruised face. “Master, does this have anything to do with Kezlat?” He asked.<br>
<br>
T’Rald tilted his head to the side, a curious expression on his face. “Yes Raff. He was there. Zalar, the magician who demonstrated the spell, is Kezlat’s older brother.”<br>
<br>
Raff’s smile had spread into a wide grin. “What was the, uh… outcome of the casting?”<br>
<br>
T’Rald raised an eyebrow at Raff. “As I said, it failed somewhat spectacularly: Zalar tried to summon a griffon in the commons. He succeeded in the summons, but failed in the control. The griffon destroyed him, and his brother before we could kill it.” <br>
<br>
He paused as Raff exploded in laughter, nearly falling from his chair. <br>
<br>
“There appears to be more to this than your simple rivalry with Kezlat,” T’Rald said. “Explain Raff.”<br>
<br>
Raff tried to control himself, gasping for air in between waves of laughter. Slowly he managed to calm himself enough to talk, but he was still giggling in between words. “Kezlat stole that scroll from me, Master,” he laughed. “He attacked me on the way back from Freeport and took the scroll from me.” He chuckled again and then wiped a tear from his eye.<br>
<br>
T’Rald looked at Raff, mildly irritated. “That would explain the bruises on your face. Why were you carrying a faulty scroll, and why would you suggest I would be interested in such a dangerous spell?”<br>
<br>
Raff waved his hand to indicate T’Rald was misunderstanding. “The Academy had deliberately tampered with the scroll so that we wouldn’t be able to use it properly.” He slapped his hand on the arm of the chair and he laughed again. “Kezlat is so stupid he just took the wrong scroll!”<br>
<br>
“The wrong scroll?” T’Rald said, his voice terse. “My patience is quickly coming to an end. Explain clearly.”<br>
<br>
Raff  quickly calmed himself and explained how he’d made a copy of the scroll so that he would have a copy for himself in the future, how the Academy had sought to trade information with the Dark Summoners, and how Kezlat had taken the incorrect scroll. He showed T’Rald the scroll he’d copied and explained that it was taken from the original scroll. Finally he told T’Rald about the deal he’d made with the Academy for the first half of the scroll. When he was done he was still smiling and T’Rald was leaning over the copied scroll on his desk.<br>
<br>
“Raff, you never cease to surprise me,” T’Rald said, a small smile on his face. “Then again, neither does Kezlat.”<br>
<br>
“I hope it can be used to aid our research, Master,” Raff said obsequiously.<br>
<br>
There is one difficulty, however” T’Rald said.<br>
<br>
“Yes?”<br>
<br>
T’Rald sat down behind his desk again. “You have a deal with the Academy to return a scroll for payment,” T’Rald reminded him.<br>
<br>
“Oh, yes, I do,” Raff answered. “I have a suggestion for that as well.”<br>
<br>
“Somehow, Raff, I am not surprised. What do you suggest? Keep in mind, of course, that I have no wish to aid the Academy in any way, and that I owe you nothing.”<br>
<br>
Raff nodded. “I would like to return to Freeport with a copy of the first half of the spell and claim my thousand platinum. However, I’d like to give them a subtly inaccurate scroll, something that will require them to spend a great deal of time solving.” He grinned to himself. “Maybe something that would attack gnomes on sight.”<br>
<br>
“Pardon?” T’Rald asked.<br>
<br>
“Nothing” Raff said, laughing.<br>
<br>
“Well Raff, this is the situation.” T’Rald rolled up the scroll carefully and stood. “I have no need whatsoever to provide you with a way to make one thousand platinum. As far as my concerns go, you do not factor into them.” He looked at Raff, intensity in his eyes. “What I do wish, however, is to thwart any attempts the Academy makes at researching this spell, and I believe that can be accomplished best by falsely leading them down the wrong path with a cunning diversion.” He indicated at Raff with the rolled up scroll. “This scroll,” he said confidently, “it just that diversion.” He moved to the door and opened it. “Come back in two days and I shall have a modified copy of the first half of the scroll ready for you to return to Academy.”<br>
<br>
Raff rose quietly. “Of course, Master.” He bowed and left quietly, knowing instinctively it was time for him to leave. <br>
<br>
Just as Raff reached the outer door, T’Rald said, “Oh, and Raff?”<br>
<br>
Raff turned and said “Yes, Master?”<br>
<br>
T’Rald smiled. “I am sure the costs for the resurrection of Zalar and Kezlat will be extremely high.” He paused. “Perhaps higher than normally is the case.”<br>
<br>
Raff smiled in return. “My thanks, Master T’Rald.” <br>
<br>
He left the building and walked back to his room, his face hurting whenever he smiled. His face hurt for the rest of the day.<br>

<br>
Raff held the bag of platinum coins in his hand, surprised how much the thousand small coins weighed. He tied the pouch carefully on his belt, inside his tunic so that it wouldn’t be ‘borrowed’ by any passing thieves. He bowed to Tara and said, “I believe this means our business is complete Tara.”<br>
<br>
Tara moved from behind her desk and approached Raff. “On behalf of the Academy, Raff, I thank you for you help in this matter. Perhaps this will form new lines of communication between Neriak and Freeport,” Tara said, smiling. “You have done both guilds a service this day, Raff.” She leaned back against her desk,  half sitting on the front of it. A few moments earlier she had taken the scroll from Raff and passed it to Konkir for immediate study.<br>
<br>
Raff bowed. “I am merely a messenger, Tara.”<br>
<br>
Tara laughed. “You are anything but a merely a messenger, Raff. Don’t ever forget that.” She paused, watching Raff carefully.  “What are your plans for the money Raff? That’s more money than most people see in a lifetime.”<br>
<br>
Raff looked down thoughtfully and thought a moment before looking up at Tara. He spoke quietly. “Tara, I have seen far too much hate in the last while – more than you can imagine, I’m sure. For a while, tonight, I plan on balancing some of the hate in my life, with some kindness.”<br>
<br>
Tara smiled again. “Going to buy something nice for a lady friend, Raff?” For a moment Raff thought she sounded a bit disappointed.<br>
<br>
Raff nodded slowly, a far away look in his eyes. “Yes Tara. A lady friend.” he said. “Something like that.”<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Raff stood quietly in the dark alley, listening to the light pattering of rain on the rooftops overhead. He was sheltered for the moment, standing under the eaves of a large house. He watched the water running down the dirty streets, swirling along the cobblestones on its way to the sewer, carrying away all the dirt and grime. Dirt and grime, he thought. How much dirt and grime have I sat in – no wallowed in - over the last decade? How many times have I wished I could just be washed clean, like these streets? He stepped out from under the eaves and turned his face to the sky, allowing the rain to splash against his skin. Through the rainy mist he could see the moon, risen fully in the sky. He wiped his face with the back of his sleeve slowly and sighed. Time to wash away some grime, he said to himself as he stepped out of the alley.<br>
<br>
He walked purposefully in the rain toward a large house near the docks. As he approached the tall building the sound of laughter and revelry drifted through the white noise of the falling rain. Standing outside the door to the house was a large burly man with thick black hair. His face was heavily scarred, including one that ran from above his right eyebrow to his jaw line, leaving a dark empty hole where is eye used to be. He turned his remaining eye to Raff and spoke gruffly. <br>
<br>
“Whatcha want? You looking for a good time?”<br>
<br>
Raff nodded silently.<br>
<br>
“You got money?”<br>
<br>
Raff nodded again and shook his belt pouch to emphasize the point.<br>
<br>
“OK, you get in.” he said, motioning with his head toward the door behind him. As Raff walked past him, the large man grabbed Raff’s shoulder in a meaty grasp. “I don’t want no trouble outta you. You hear?”<br>
<br>
“There’ll be no trouble from me, friend. You can count on it.” The other man grunted and removed his hand from Raff’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
The sounds of laugher and clinking of glasses were much louder as Raff walked up the narrow staircase to the main floor of the old building. Interspersed with the party noises Raff heard the unmistakable cries of passion, making the nature of the building obvious to anyone who approached it. He reached the landing and entered a doorway into a crowded room. Before he walked two feet inside the room a scantily clad woman draped herself over him, her hand roaming across his chest.<br>
<br>
“Hey there fella,” she slurred, obviously drunk. “Looking for a good time?” She was fairly tall for a human, and Raff thought her blonde hair suggested some high elf in her past. Her breath reeked of alcohol, and from her behavior, it looked like she’d been drinking for a long while. <br>
<br>
Raff pressed a platinum coin in the palm of her hand and said, “Yes, sweetheart, but not from you, I’m afraid. I’m looking for someone in particular.” He frowned in mock sadness and she responded in kind.<br>
<br>
“What? Am I ugly?” she asked, her eyelashes batting.<br>
<br>
“No, gorgeous, you’re just too good looking for someone like me.” He smiled, supporting her as she staggered. “I’m looking for Melissa. Is she around?”<br>
<br>
“Oooooh,” she squealed. “Like ‘em young, do ya?”<br>
<br>
Raff forced himself to smile even though his gut twisted at her suggestion. “Something like that beautiful. Where is she?”<br>
<br>
“You don’t need her!” she said putting her hand on his chest. “You won’t get anything out of her! She’s got no experience.” She ran a finger down his chest seductively. “You need a woman not a girl,” she slurred.<br>
<br>
Raff took her hand in his and held up another platinum coin. He pulled it away as she reached for it. “This is yours if you take me to her.”<br>
<br>
She smiled brightly. “OK, hon, follow me.” She turned and walked to a banister staircase. Her attempts to be seductive combined with her intoxication, making the walk look ridiculous, and Raff found it hard to keep from laughing. He followed her up the staircase, stopping to support her twice on the way up. At the top of the stairs she turned and walked down a short hallway to a closed door.  From the sounds around him, Raff thought business was good that night.<br>
<br>
“Here ya are sugar.” She smiled at him again. “This is her bedroom. She’s been pretty busy tonight, though, so you might need to wake her.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you,” Raff said as he gave her the second platinum. She took it and stumbled past him to the stairs.<br>
<br>
“If you change yer mind, I’ll be downstairs big spender,” she called to him as she started down the stairs.<br>
<br>
Raff waited until she was gone and then took a deep breath. Carefully he opened the door to Melissa’s room, trying to be quiet, and slipped inside.<br>
<br>
It took a few minutes for his eyes to adjust to the dim lighting inside the room, but years in the blackness of Neriak had heightened his night vision, and the light from the full moon shining through the window allowed him to see well enough. The room was bare except for a dresser, a night table, and a fairly large bed. He could make out the shape of a young girl under the covers, and he moved stealthily toward her. Before he dropped off the bag of money, he had to be sure that the girl was who he thought she was. He had managed to watch her over the last few days, and by talking to some of the girls around this house, he managed to find out enough to convince him this was the girl he was looking for. His questions had confirmed that her father had died about five years ago while attacking the man who had fired him from the bakery the day before. The bakery owner had also died in the fight, and the following day the owner’s son had avenged his father by killing the girl’s mother. Once the girl had recovered from the brutal beating she’d received from the son, she started a new life living on the streets. A few years later she was convinced to enter prostitution. The thought of someone so young turning to the life of a street prostitute sickened Raff to his core.<br>
<br>
 When he reached her bedside, he looked down at her. She was lying on her back, an arm across her chest. Her long blonde hair cascaded down the pillow and off the bed. Raff gasped in surprise when he looked at her face. She looked to be about 12 years old. Has it been that long? He asked himself. He looked to her right hand and saw, glimmering in the moonlight, a silver ring. Raff didn’t have to look at it to know it had the markings of Erolisi Marr on it. For years it had been his most prized possession. He choked back a sudden cry and pressed his hand to his mouth as his body shook with an uncontrollable shudder. His eyes flooded with tears and he reached out with his other hand to steady himself against the night table. He slowly sank to his knees and covered his head with his hands. He knelt there many long minutes, the girl a footstep away from him, sleeping peacefully. The moonlight silhouetted his body, casting a shadow on the floor, as he stayed there, hunched tightly, tears running down his face quietly. Years of repressed sadness, anger and bitterness leapt forward to consume him. He rocked on his knees slightly as his body trembled with memories long sealed away in the fortress of his heart.<br>
<br>
With immense difficulty he managed to remain quiet, even though he continued to cry for over five minutes. Finally, he managed to calm himself enough to wipe his face and open his eyes. He moved to his feet slowly, a man four times his age, and retrieved the large bag of platinum from under his tunic. He placed it on the bed beside the young girl carefully, not wanting to wake her. Then he removed a note from his belt and placed it on the nightstand. Breathing deeply, he walked quietly out of the room and locked the door from the inside before closing it.<br>
<br>
He stood out in the dark hallway wiping his face carefully on his tunic to remove all trace of his tears before heading downstairs. When he reached the bottom of the stairs he made his way through the crowded room, looking for his earlier assistant. She saw him before he saw her, and pushed her way to meet him.<br>
<br>
“That couldn’t have been enough time for a strong man like you!” she said seductively.<br>
<br>
Raff turned and looked at her with dark eyes, utterly devoid of mirth. “Listen carefully,” he said. “I need you to do something very, very important for me. If you do it, I will pay you ten platinum for your work. Do you understand?”<br>
<br>
The seriousness in Raff’s look made the woman pause before she responded with her usual suggestive answer. Raff knew fully well that ten platinum was more money than the woman would make in a month.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I understand. What do I have to do?” she asked meekly. Raff was impressed by how fast she seemed to sober up.<br>
<br>
“I do not want Melissa disturbed tonight, for any reason.” He stared at her with eyes that suggested she didn’t have a choice in the matter. “Do you understand?” He asked again.<br>
<br>
“Y… yes, I understand,” she said, her voice timid.<br>
<br>
“Good,” he said. “Here are three platinum coins. You will find me tomorrow at the Jade Tiger Inn. When you come tomorrow, I will give you the other seven coins.” He started to give her the three coins, but pulled his hand back as she reached for them. “There’s one more thing,” he added. She nodded silently. “You are to under no circumstances, ever let her know that you saw me, or who I am. Is that clear?” When she nodded again he gave her the three coins. “Good. I will expect to see you tomorrow morning then.” She turned to leave and he put his hand to her chin, turning her head toward him and glared at her intensely. “And one other thing. If I ever find out you haven’t followed my orders, I will kill you without a thought. Understand?”<br>
<br>
The woman swallowed and nodded.<br>
<br>
“Good,” he said, and left without another word.<br>
<br>
Outside the rain was falling harder now, and the water was pooling in parts of the streets where traffic had worn the stones down more than others. As Raff trudged through the wet alleys, his head was down. He was watching the water as it ran along the stones, carrying away the dirt -washing the streets clean.<br>
