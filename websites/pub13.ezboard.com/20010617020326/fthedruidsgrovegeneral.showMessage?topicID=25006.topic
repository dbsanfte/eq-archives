Druid vs Wizard?</span><hr size=1> Hi again. Today was our Second Guild Anniversary, my guild the Blades of Light on Solusek Ro is 2 years old now, and to celebrate, we had a big dueling fest in the EC Tunnel. Anyways I was pitted against a wizard same level as me, 31, and needless to say I lost. His nukes were doing a ton of damage, even with the buffs I cast beforehand. I thought I would interrupt him using my l33t melee skills :) and the spell Dizzying Wind. It came pretty close though, the duel came down to who got the last nuke spell of first. Just want to know, what would be the best way of dueling a wizard? What spells would you guys use? And was I doing wrong? I like to duel a lot, so the info would help me out a lot in the future.<br>

<br>
If you were a little higher 45+, it would be very simple. Stand there, take his nukes, heal heal heal, he runs out of mana, and then you just es arms his ass to death. Wizards can't do jack without mana. Druids can dot with es arms or quest bracer and DD with lum staff. Well, I should say most wizards, especially around level 45. Later they get things like a quest robe with a DD on it, tho the cast time is 20!!! seconds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujinrei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JinRei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/5/01 3:38:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> imo</span><hr size=1> Personally I think you should start with standard buff stacking  mem heal spell (chloroblast if you have) mem a gate spell and a self port spell. other than that mem nukes not dots (dots are dispellable but wizards cannot heal so nukes are fine) before the fight bind somewheer semi close and leave the dru ring on the opposite side of the battlefield , then start tracking the wizard then accept the duel . Plain nukes til you both get low in hps cast gate then heal then resume the fight. or alternate way if you are higher level with good resist gera just heal while they nuke they should go oom first (heal being unresistable and nukes not so). last note never use snare and root . they are so crippled in pvp 70mr will usually stop them cold. jyaa nee.<br>

Start with snare. Get out of range and then nuke/dot to your hearts content while he tries to get within range of you. Get out of range, heal if needed, mix-repeat. Use any of the winds spells that interupt casting if needed. <p><P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#2F4F2F"></FONT>

Druid vs Wizard?</span><hr size=1> A decent Wizard will hand you your rear on a silver plate unless you can get out of range *fast* and start dropping DoTS, and then nuking while he tries to dispel.<br>
<br>
They have one spell that gives them a huge advantage over every casting class: Shock of Lightning, their level 12 lightning DD.<br>
<br>
Why? Because it is unresistable, guaranteed knockback unless you are up against a wall, or in a corner. You might resist the damage down to 40 or 50 points, but if he's geared, that adds up, slowly but surely. Typically, they just open with that, and keep hammering you with it until you die, or get so low on health that they can finish you with one of their bigger nukes, or just smack you around with one of the more powerful Lure spells, which cuts through resistances like a knife through butter.<br>
<br>
Good way to counter this unresistable knockback is to wedge yourself in to a corner, or, barring that, get up against a wall. Now the knockback does nothing, and they are pretty much wasting their mana while you nuke the hell out of them. Once they switch to their big guns, just heal yourself. Due to the PvP damage reduction, your heals will be far more efficient than his nukes, and unless your gear is very poor, he will run OOM long before you do.<br>
<br>
Now, keep in mind that wizards are fragile, very fragile, and they have to rely soley on resists, the level 12 dd, and sheer overwhelming damage to stop you. <br>
<br>
Basically, you just have to run. Run run run. Use your speed advantage. If you're in a large enough area, SoW will eventually give you enough breathing room to cast a DoT (don't waste mana on snare, they'll resist it every time with decent gear), and then go pure offense while they try to dispel. If they don't dispel, run them around and keep out of their nuke range until they die from your dots. Dead wizard.<br>
<br>
If you're in the Arena, then Levitate becomes your best friend. Scramble up those pillars. Bind on top of one before the fight if you can. Get up there, and you are usually out of their spell range, unless they are fairly high level, in which case you're going to eat an Ice Comet, or possibly something much, much more nasty.<br>
<br>
Once on the pillar, drop dots and start blasting, until they come in to spell range. Then you run again.<br>
<br>
It's all about exploiting the fact that we move faster than they do, even if they have Jboots. They stop to cast, we run away. Unless you started running when you were very close to them, you'll be out of spell range before their nukes land.<br>
<br>
All in all, Druid vs Wizard is usually either very one sided (if the wizard uses his lvl 12 DD, and druid doesn't counter it, or if the wizard doesn't use said DD at all, in which case he's toast), or it's a very long and involved fight that usually drains both casters nearly dry, and often comes down to who has the larger mana pool and better resists.<br>

Druid vs Wizard?</span><hr size=1> How lame is it to just run away...face them like a man, or dont face them at all, running around and kiting is lame.<br>
<br>
A wizard has Very few HP.  PvP DD does not do 100% and is less mana effiecant than healing...Did any of you compete or watch the bobt?  How long did the ones who straight nuked last? about 1 round max. <br>
 I wrote this thinking you were 50+, but some applies to all lvls i guess, so take it for what its worth:<br>
<br>
Your Nukes will take mana and will not be nearly as efficiant as doting, but remeber a wizard has low HP.  Best damage/mana ratio is Winged Death with right click Arms, because they are almost NEVER resisted even with 255 MR.  1 Winged death, traped under 2 crap buffs and your garenteed the winner if you can heal yourself.  Ro's, dot arms, then winged death, and the nasty DoT is very hard to dispell.<br>
<br>
Winged death does about 1k dmg in pvp, thats a large portion of a wizards HP bar.  Even if you dont think you can handle them with DoTs, or arnt of sufficent lvl to have Winged death, if they straight nuke, and you straight heal, you will have more mana in the end.  <br>
<br>
Think about it, wildfire, IF it hits for full in pVp is about 600ish damage and it rarly hits over 400 if that (with decent resists).  Thats 320 mana for 400-600 damage.  Your heal (choroblast? Didnt read what lvl you were), is 480ish HP for 175 mana.  Thats almost 1k of healing per same amount of mana as 1 of their nukes.  <br>
<br>
Even consider melee, it isnt huge, but epic is 20/30 other weapons are decent i guess, but any damage has  a chance of interupting their spell, and it does do some damage, so it cant hurt. <p>-ArK<br><br>

That was in the Arena.<br>
<br>
Rigged from the start if you ask me.  No offense to the participants, but 2 druids fighting in a 100 by 100 square?<br>
<br>
Duel?? use everything at your disposal, every tactic you got.  Run away, inter zone gate if you can.<br>
<br>
Use hide, use /all. Use every dirty trick you can think of.<br>
<br>
Use all your click toys(arms especially), when you get the chance.<br>
<br>
Have your resists as high as you can go.  Not like you need ac.<br>
<br>
He will most assuredly have his MR up(for we will not want to be snared or rooted), use that knowledge against him.<br>
<br>
But, telling a druid not to kite a player because it's lame is silly, though I would not kite a wizard.  Kite melees though.<br>
<br>
Be like Mel Gibson in the Patriot, dirty, stealthy, and mean.  Those Redcoats will die, you will win.  &quot;Pride will do&quot;.<br>

Druid vs Wizard?</span><hr size=1> Yea, the healing thing doesnt work with the wizards standing toe to toe, they have their stuns, and a few very fast casting damage spells, do about 480 per pop (about 2.5 sec cast time it seemed) in PvP, if I remember my two duels right that I had with a wizard.  <br>
<br>
The first time I fought the wizard, I tried to go toe to toe, and heal myself, couldnt get a heal off, too damn slow casting, and kept getting stunned.  I died pretty fast.  <br>
<br>
The second time, I ran a little, hit with a magic debuff first, to cancel the armor skin, or whatever it is.  Next, I snared and rooted, ran a little more.  Hit with a blind (cheap cost, but got her timing off on her spells).  Every time I heard her casting, I hauled ass out of range, kept just on the edge of range from her, when she hit me, I ran out of range and healed myself.  <br>
<br>
I would run in, hit her with something mana cheap, and run back out of casting range to heal.  Finally, I ran in, and she didnt cast, she was out of mana, dead wizard.  So basically, run the wizard out of mana, by running in and out of casting range, in casting range to take a single hit, out of casting range to heal yourself, your mana will outlast their mana this way (healing more efficient than damage).  When they stop casting when you run in, they are out of mana, and time to kill a wizard.  <br>

<br>
I think xashran the lost or whatever has hit the nail on the head.  And after 2 years of fighting wiz's everyday and some very good ones on the dirt hole called rallos zek...the tactis he described are the only way to go.<br>
<br>
Especially if you can get a ro's into him then sink a WD under buffs while he's runnen after you.  Then its game over.<br>
<br>
Moral of pvp with a druid is this-  You start thinking your a wizard or to much of a cleric and your gonna be very dead very soon.  Play like a druid on the other hand and you'll win the majority of the time or be able to get away if the tides turn.<br>

Go down to that level and look at the spells. and come up with a good tactic.<br>

By the way, I cant wait till 34 so I can get Fury of Air. That seems like the best spell to use against him in my opinion.<br>

<br>
Just cast the 12th level wind spell.  This will interrupt him every time.  Wait for him to cast.  After a few interrupts, if he slows down, throw in a DoT, then interrupt...<br>
<br>
If you are lucky, he will slow donw because of his lack of mana.  <br>
<br>
If you get a DoT to stick, run in and melee.  But get ready to turn it off and interrupt again.  This will probably get him to start running (wiz hate to stand infront of someone else, especially if they cant cast).  If he tries to shadow step (or wizards equivilant) find him and continue.<br>
