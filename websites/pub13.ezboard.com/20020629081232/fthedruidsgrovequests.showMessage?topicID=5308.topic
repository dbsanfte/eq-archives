"Oh, hello Cryth, welcome to the New Thicket Inn! If you'll excuse me, I'm a bit busy copying this new [scroll]. I'll be with you in a moment to chat, or to trade if you've come about the [earring]."<br><br>You say, 'What scroll?'<br><br>Rebecca Cabbageleaf looks up again with a quiet smile, "I'm making a copy of a new Protection spell, it's very exciting! The druids of Norrath have just completed an important ritual, and the gods have blessed us with this new spell! I'd be happy to scribe you a copy, if you were to fetch me the [ingredients]."<br><br>You say, 'What ingredients?'<br><br>Rebecca Cabbageleaf says, "Oh, let me see... I'll need a sheet of fancy Blessed parchment, a small flask of Dark Root ink, and of course a large quill. I think a Stormraven's quill would be best, certainly better than this one I've been using so far. Bring those items to me and I'll be happy to make you a copy for yourself. I'm not sure where you'll find all of those, I seem to have bought up the last of the stock in several places. Someone's bound to have them for sale, good luck with it!"<br><br>Rebecca Cabbageleaf smiles warmly, "Brilliant, you've brought me some more supplies! Here, please take this last copy I've made. I'd planned to use it for myself, but I'll let you use it so you don't have to wait for me to make a new one. I do hope you enjoy it!"<br><br>You gain experience!<br>-------------------<br><br>1. Blessed Parchment is purchased in Rivervale. The merchant's name is Byl Babbinsbort at loc -140, -120.<br><br>2. Dark Root Ink is purchased in Greater Faydark at Kelethin. Near the druid guild is a store called Bilrib's Smithy. Instead of going through the door, edge around the right side of the building where you'll find Bilrio Surecut at loc 645, 385.<br><br>3. Stormraven Quill is purchased in Surefall Glade in the druid guild. The building has a sign which reads Jaggedpine Treefolk. At the back counter is a merchant named Sequea Erthinon who sells the quill.<br><br>I paid roughly 284pp for the parchment, 252pp for the ink, and 261pp for the quill. This was with 100+ charisma and with apprehensive, ally, and amiable faction respectively. (I'm a Wood Elf so naturally the Kelethin folks will like me more).  <br><br>Your price may vary depending on charisma or faction, but expect to pay between 750-800pp for this spell.<br><br>The reward is a spell scroll:<br><br>Protection of the Cabbage (NO DROP)<br>Level 59, 500 mana<br>Single-target version of Protection of the Glades<br><H3>TRIVIALS</H3><br>As of 6-7-2002, the final combine is still a no-fail proposition while each of the nine gifts' combines is at 250 or ABOVE.

The costs below only include Store Bought Components, it assumes you've foraged and farmed anything that is foragable and farmable (except gems). It also assumes NO fees for enchanter services and subcomponent pottery combines etc.<br>The absolute minimum cost, assuming bought gems, is about 2.5K with no failures anywhere. If all the gems are farmed (good luck), the minimum can drop to below 1K.<br><br>Here's some notes:<br><br>1st Gift of Elves - Demi-Sec Champagne<br>A 250 brewer has a 95% success rate. Cost of materials per champagne is about 35pp<br><br>2nd Gift of Elves - Mistletoe Cutting Sickle<br>A smith with effective 255 skill seems to succeed 1 in 3 (based on 24 combines, 8 successes). Often 1 subcombine failure in the attempts. This works out to a raw cost in materials of about 1200pp for a success.<br><br>3rd Gift of Elves - Golden Idol of Tunare<br>Trivial at 242 pottery skill, success rate at 250 pottery a little better than 50%. Cost per attempt about 225pp, but be prepared to provide 3 sets of components, or just pay the potter 2-4K for a finished idol (market price depends on server). 200 skill potters have about 15% success rate.<br><br>1st Gift of Man - Blessed Fishing Pole<br>Raw cost per attempt is about 175pp. Not a lot of data on this. Guessing about 50% success rate for a 200 skill fisher.<br><br>2nd Gift of Man - Star Ruby Stein<br>Raw cost per attempt is about 75pp. At 250 pottery skill success rate is about 50%. Be prepared with 3 sets of components or just pay the potter 1-4K for a finished stein (market price depends on the server). 200 skill potters have about 10% success rate.<br><br>3rd Gift of Man - Ceremonial Solstice Robe<br>About 300pp for first attempt, 40pp per attempt thereafter. Could get really expensive since there are not a lot of 250 tailors out there. Guessing about 1K average for a 200 tailor. I've heard of a 232 tailor charging 1K for success if you bring components.<br><br>1st Gift of Halflings - Lotus Pie<br>Raw cost per attempt is low (50pp?). I've seen people selling finished Pies for 500-1K, seems to be standard on our server.<br><br>2nd Gift of Halflings - Misty Thicket Picnic<br>Raw cost per attempt a few pp (approx). I've seen finished ones sell for 500pp-1K. However, after patch the quantities have increased, hence the price should be lower by now.<br><br>3rd Gift of Halflings - Lucky Cabbage<br>Raw cost per attempt < 10pp.<br><br>So the conclusion is... farm and forage everything, pay the cost of gems and other store bought materials, find 250 skill tradeskillers for each item, and you should be able to get away with about 3.5K average cost. <br><br><h3>FOR NON DRUIDS</h3><br>If you are not a Druid and you've completed the PoTC quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.<br><br>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another earring after verifying your loss.<br><br>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the "out of charges" bug. <br><br>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged Xanthe's earring back.<br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxiggin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xiggin</A> at: 6/16/02 7:47:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/13/02 1:50:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5308.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Complete Spoiler Protection of the Cabbage!</span><hr size=1> <H3> COMPONENT LOCATOR </h3><br>Second Volume:<br>Soda: Shadow Haven (River Mudhands in the Dorf cave off the spires)<br><br>Third Volume:<br>Celestial Solvent: <br>-The Bazaar off the spell component vendor<br>-Shadowhaven, off spell component vendor<br>Mistletoe: Shadow Havem - Kolburn Inglewort (176, 632), Zimloro Jalobottle (-414, 1426) <br><br>Jar of Acid: various smithing merchants (NFP for sure, 2 Smithy named vendors in ShadowHaven, Sateal Deirosap (-670, -35) in the Bazaar.<br>Gems: jewelcraft vendors<br><br>Fourth Volume:<br>Poison Vial: various poison merchants (Dagnor's Cauldron for sure)<br>Mortar and Pestle: Sold in Dagnors and in Thurgadin<br>Lead Sulfite: N.
