At any rate I again want to state I am truly sorry Nathren will have to wait until a later day to get his epic.  I and We as a guild followed the reservation system to the best of our knowledge.  I also feel by speaking with with the guild leader of watchers BEFORE rage even popped to avoid a possible conflict, We tried to make the best of a bad situation.  The fg/rage bottleneck is a pain in the ass for a lot of clerics, and I feel sorry for them.  Regarding this particular case I guess I am left wondering if there was a better way all parties could have handled it.  What that is I don't know, seems to Me We tried our best to be diplomatic about it.  Sorry again Nathren hope You get Your epic soon.<br>

<br>
1) That the FGs would no longer be considered reservable by those whose sole purpose was to block people from going after Ragefire.<br>
<br>
2) That a camping cleric who spots Ragefire via feigned monk or Ranger tracking can step on the FG raid inorder to take down Ragefire.<br>
<br>
I would hope to see one or both of these in the FG rules section so that when rule 1 is violated a guild could just invoke rule 2.<br>
<br>
By putting these in the rules it would become more clear cut and someone who camps Ragefire is told he is SOL your 22 hours means nothing.<br>
<br>
It would keep FGs reservable to those that need training and leave the option for a camping cleric to take them down if Ragefire is up.<br>
<br>
More of these and other FGs abuses will only continue as people no longer respect a person camping a non-reservable mob and other don't view the FG's as reservable. If you want to keep FGs reservable try to think of rules that are not very complex and get them put in. Saying something is understood to be this way or that way only leads to grey areas and further arguments. <br>
<br>
Now as for my stating how long I was there in ooc I did that everytime one of your raiders claimed Ragefire. I could not get up and just leave (without training you) and I did not like having Ragefire being claimed by your raid being rubbed in my face. I did not log on about the same time to camp ragefire as Puma and Rinivi did. So while Puma did default a camp to Rinivi he never camped him for 20+hours seen Ragefire spawn the defaulted to Rinivi. Don't make his actions sound so noble.<br>
<br>
At least I am glad of one thing. It was Puma that got it. Why? We go back a long ways and were even in the same guild together at one point.<br>

Let me (politely) suggest a different scenario, and you can tell me where I err:<br>
<br>
In my scenario, FGs aren't reservable.  Nasren has been there for 18 hours, Puma walks in and shouts &quot;camp check!&quot;  Nasren shouts &quot;Ragefire!&quot; and Puma goes to Wakening Lands or something.  2 hours later Ragefire pops.  He calls in his guild, they commit Giant Genocide, and kill Ragefire off too.  Epic done.<br>
<br>
You might suggest that Puma will also sit down in the lair at hour 18.  At hour 20, they both shout to their guilds and a mad dash ensues.  The battle starts, both guilds jump in, one group gets the exp.  Cleric X joins the group real quick, loots the heart, and everyone walks away angry.  While this is possible, I don't think it it will happen!  In general this server is pretty good at walking away when someone is there already.  In particular, I'd point to an example like Lord Grimrot. He is another irritating and long-running quest that clerics do.  Cleric A is sitting at the ruins.  Cleric B walks up, chats for a minute, and then goes on his way.  No hard feelings.<br>
<br>
In my scenario, Ragefire is camped almost constantly.  The Naggy raid ends, and someone shouts, &quot;Ragefire!&quot;.  Or maybe someone has left their monk-alt in the Lair from before the Naggy pop.  In my scenario, the next epic goes to the most masochistic cleric.  This isn't perfect either, but I think the rules are more straightforward and understandable.  They lead to fewer hard feelings.<br>

You can make up as many theoretical reasons why fire giant reservations do not interfere with the cleric epic as you like Nico.  All I can say is if the reservations did not exist Nasren would have his epic right now.  He was in the lair from the time the last raid killed Ragefire.<br>
<br>
What is the right thing to do?  We have rules about fire giants but not Ragefire.<br>
<br>
Who owns the Ragefire spawn?  Is it the raid that reserved the fire giants or the person that has been waiting in the lair for 22 hours?<br>
<br>
I hesitate to say it because I am 100% against adding more rules to this game, but if we are going to have fire giants reservable we need to clarify exactly how Ragefire works too.  There can be no gray area here unless we want to promote people fighting with each other all assuming they are right.  You have no idea how many made up rules I heard over guild chat this weekend about Ragefire.  The fact exists that there are no rules and until there are we're going to have his problem each and every time he pops.<br>

If someone was indeed rubbing it in Your face as You say, than I strongly disaprove of that.  Really not more to say about this situation I guess.  I tried My best to resolve a potential conflict before it happened, tried to follow the reservation system as best I could.  But it is as Bahd says, there is to much grey area, and many people have many different interpretations of the rules and these conflicts are going to continue to happen as long as the system remains the way it is.  I'll end My side of this discussion by saying once again I am sorry that Nathren will have to wait any longer to get his epic.<br>

<br>
I think rage should be treated like naggy , as in naggy raiders can stomp fg raiders.<br>
<br>
so if you use method 1 or 2 ( monk fd , ranger track ) when rage pops you get your crew there and kill him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
next part is about the nasren , puma debate.<br>
<br>
when the rules of the game change so dont the players that are involved ... <br>
<br>
if puma knew he couldnt rely on fg reservation he would have changed his tactics. (ie he would not have been 1 hour late)<br>
so who knows who would have had rage first.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont think you should beable to reserve FG so you can block people from rage. that is why I believe you should beable to stomp a FG raid IF rage is up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
after reading the second half of the thread it seems people dont want to get rid of fg reservation but they ( they as in clerics) want to come to a clear understanding on what rage is...<br>
<br>
is he campable? <br>
is he FCFS?<br>
is he FFA?<br>
<br>
no matter what he is I dont think it should interfere FG reservations at all as long as it is understood that when he pops all fg reservations are null and void until rage is killed.<br>
<br>
I think campable is the way to go really... with the understanding that your crew needs to be there in less than an hour or rage becomes fcfs?<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont know , I am not a cleric .. these things should be worked out by them....<br>
<br>
all I know is ever since the epics came into the game people that play this game have changed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 748<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/4/01 12:38:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm FG´s :)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> after reading the second half of the thread it seems people dont want to get rid of fg reservation but they ( they as in clerics) want to come to a clear understanding on what rage is...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I wouldn't make this assumption.  Based on the vote almost 50% of the server does want to remove fire giant reservations.  The attempt to establish a guideline for Ragefire is only necessary because, as close as the vote was, maintaining the reservations won and we still want to honor the reservations even when we disagree with them.<br>

<br>
The problem is you're both assuming Nasren would have been first there IF FG's weren't reservable... I submit that's the flaw.<br>
<br>
So, Puma logged in at his raid time... well, that makes sense in a reservation environment.  Remove his somewhat 'safe' reserved raid (safe in the sense that the target might be there when he goes there) and why would he be logging in then?<br>
<br>
Realistically, without that reservation, pressure would have been there for him to potentially be there before Nasren sent in (or logged in) his alt... so no, without FG reservations there is NOTHING guaranteeing Nasren would now have his epic, other than what you wish had happened.<br>
<br>
So, yes I'm creating alternate scenarios... but so are you when you're claiming with certainty that Nasrens epic was ONLY interfered with by FG reservations... the difference is I'm acknowledging any of my scneraios may or may not have happened (which includes the possibility you are right)... you are dead set that it could only have happened ONE other way, that's simply incorrect.<br>
<br>
Nasren's point about clarifying 'who has rights' is the real issue.  It will be a real issue whether FG's are or are not reserved... the various 'possible' scenarios I outlined of what might have been included several different interpretations people could have had over 'who is right.'  THAT is the problem right now...<br>
<br>
Is it the first Cleric in the zone 'claiming camp' that has rights?  If so, why should a fully ready to roll raid WAIT on that in an FCFS environment?  It's not the standard for other FCFS... and there is certainly Epic greed on the lines... frankly I don't see that standing cleric (or other class) getting their way regularly on that one... someone will 'roll over their ragefire camp' (as quoted from another source in this thread).<br>
<br>
Is it the first raid on the scene?  How long does that raid have to be there...<br>
<br>
I don't think you'd find many Fire Giant Reservation proponents (and I'll acknowledge I'm probably the loudest of them) that would assume that a true FG raid should have precedence over Ragefire (I wouldn't and don't)... but I do think that the situation over 'who is next' wouldn't be civil in FCFS.<br>
<br>
I can think of a single guild (last memorial day weekend) that had made plans to camp Ragefire all Memorial Day weekend, and work around FG raids as needed)... drop FG reservations and that's 10 Clerics every friday (or earlier) claiming camp rights... and you thought the VS list was long... /chuckle...<br>
<br>
The real question right now shouldn't be about FG's... the real question should be among Clerics over how Ragefire should be handled on this server... once that's figured out... I suspect an easy compromise would work to appease the one Fire Giant raid every 8 to 10 days that actually wants Fire Giants... Make a Ragefire reservation (or something)... let interested Fire Giant raids (like mine) coordinate with the designated Ragefire camper... hell, I don't mind that... do something about Ragefire... and understand FCFS isn't the answer... take a long look at the number of guilds with 55+ Clerics that don't have epics... remove that FG reservation bottleneck and every single one of themm will be shooting for that camp and staying on it till every single one of their clerics has it done... if anything, this FG 'bottleneck' just mixes up the deck and gets some different folks than just members of {a guild}.<br>
<br>
But stop assigning incorrect blame, and start looking for a Ragefire solution... everything else will fall into place.<br>

They are a good group of people and are using the FG reservations the way they were intended and I know that no one is disputing that. I'm glad I am getting these opportunities because I would like to leanr how to not only pull the FG's themselves but I am trying to gather as much knowledge for when the time comes for my guilds Nagafen reservation. Regardless of how much I like these FG raids, or how much  I desperately want to learn how to be a good puller and learn SolB, I do not want to stand between a cleric and his/her Epic Weapon.<br>
<br>
I firmly believe that Ragefire camping clerics and their respective raid crews should be able to come crashing through and stomp the FG's down and get the cleric their epic. As well, in loo of that, it would also be nice of the cleric or a rep from the Rage killing crew to talk to the person who had FG's reserved and let them know that their raid will have to be postponed because Ragefire had spawned. That's only polite after all.<br>
<br>
A comprimise can be arranged, we just have to try. I sincerely sympathize with the clerics of Brell due to this bottleneck. I hope we can work out something that will make us all happier and more comfortable with the situation. <p>Scaleroo Lizziekins

People will stop reserving FG's for a chance at rage once they realize that nobody will honor that reservation.  We don't need to make more GD rules for it, just act.  People will learn the rules.<br>
<br>
Quite honstly, watchers tripped over themselves by letting their ragefire get stepped on.  Nasren had been there for 22 hours, watchers knew about Ragefire being up before Puma even logged on.  It's a simple operation in my opinion, walk into Solb, kill the FG's (since one more cleric epic is indeed more valuable than the crap the FG's drop).  Apologize to Puma but make it clear in your statement that you would have respected his reservation had it been legitimate, but since he reserved the FG's in order to attempt to reserve ragefire, his reservation was not legitimate.<br>
<br>
Change the rules from within the game, don't rely on this board to do it.  This board already does to much.<br>

Veldan,<br>
Sorry, but Watchers respects the raid reservation system.  We will not run over someone elses reservation just to get what we want.  You either adhere to all the rules or none of them.  You can't selectively apply them when it's convenient.<br>
<br>
Nico,<br>
The problem is you're assuming Nasren would not have his epic if the fire giant reservation didn't get in the way.  I believe you are wrong the same way you keep telling me I am.  He was there for 22+ hours from the time that Ragefire was killed the day before.  If the person camping the spawn did not have to respect someone elses fire giant raid Nasren would have his epic right now.<br>

If that means bending the system a bit, so be it.  The system needs to be redefined.  It's not going to happen through this board, because people here can't agree on the smell of sh*t.<br>
<br>
So you have two choices.  Go through yet ANOTHER FG vote here, or change the system from inside the game.  Perhaps being a young buck I have yet to learn to give the necessary respect to the established rules of this server, and have not realized yet the sacrifice that went into making them, and preserving them.  One thing I do know though, is that people reserving FG's for Ragefire are thumbing their noses at the reservation system that Watchers still respects, perhaps even more than myself saying that you should walk over illegitimate FG raids.<br>
<br>
Firegiants for Ragefire are NOT in the spirit of the rules.  Work to reestablish the spirit of the rules. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uveldanlionsfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldan Lionsfury</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/4/01 7:13:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 751<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/4/01 9:17:59 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm FG´s :)</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
When we talked, it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> AFTER</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Nasren had spammed guildchat that Ragefire had spawned.  In other words, when we talked, Ragefire was already up.<br>
<br>
The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ONLY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> reason Nasren didn't get his epic, was because I told the guild to respect the board policy of the Fire Giants.<br>
<br>
Believe me, they gave me enough suggestions that we could have went in, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> interfereing with your FG raid, and taken Ragefire.  <br>
<br>
I chose to take guild ridicule over the boards. <br>
<br>
I'm already regretting that choice.<br>

It starts with the Nagafen list, giving the guild up for it 48 hours to complete the raid. This is a 48 hour delay on ragefire i.e. 2 wasted ragefires between 2 Nagafen spawns. Second the reservability of FG's delays the kill of ragefire, which causes the same scenario on a lower level. Its a fact that on Brell we are wasting 3 if not more cleric epics a week, just do the maths. Under FCFS Nagafen AND ragefire would be killed on pop. Just do the maths.<br>

Ignoring the rules causing this issue will keep the system in place.  Following the rules to the 'T' will lead to the systems demise.<br>
<br>
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.  But at least nobody can't point fingers at me and say I've never offered up one bit of help in keeping this dinosaur running. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uveldanlionsfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldan Lionsfury</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/5/01 5:47:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubraddox1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Braddox1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/5/01 7:22:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm FG´s :)</span><hr size=1> Rykilth, perhaps You knew ragefire had spawned but I did not.  Either way the fact remains I still feel I did the right thing in trying to reach a diplomatic solution to the problem.  If You recall our conversation I said to You I have no wish to deny anyone their epic, and that if Puma wasn't online 30 min past the scheduled time of his raid I had no problem with watchers taking over the raid.  You agreed to those terms and as fate would have it puma signed on about 5 min before those 30 min were up.  I am sorry You regret Your decision because whether or not Your guild agrees with it, I think it was a noble one.  Oh, and since some nitpicking about the events has begun I better correct Myself on something.  I contacted Stamen who put Rykilth in contact with Me.  <br>

<br>
Really?<br>
<br>
How?<br>
<br>
How long has Ragefire ever been left standing after a spawn?  More than two hours and I'd be quite surprised...  If Rage has ever been up half a day then I'd perhaps concede your point... but I just don't think that's happening.<br>
<br>
Fire Giant reservations are changing WHO gets Ragefire, that I'll agree to and agree THAT needs to be looked at... FG reservations are NOT bottlenecking Ragefire, they have nothing to do with Rage's spawn, they're NOT keeping him from being killed...<br>
<br>
As for your Nagafen point... that I'll concede.  Every day Nagafen is up is a day Ragefire can't spawn... I'm not opposed to seeing a lot of those reservations go away (Dragons etc.) including FG's, but the reasons better be the right ones... trying to mask the Cleric bottleneck with Fire Giants is laughable.<br>
