I have found a lot of people almost taking offense to a druid that would wear it. They tell me that because of the +int only SK and necro should be allowed to roll, but then the ac and strength comes in and some tanks might want it, then the saves come in and everyone wants it. <br>

I think with stats like those, anyone who CAN use should be allowed to roll, its no drop anyways so they can't turn around and sell it. I think the only class up there that it isn't good for (I am not saying the best) is monk because of the weight. I know as a druid who is in all black (coldain skin gloves/boots, giant scalemail arms, and gnome skin tunic/legs) I wanna keep that look till 60 but wanna upgrade from gnome skin. I think this armor is a great black upgrade with lots of stats, and the added graphics in the black! So if a roll on this is CAWU, druids can use, and in my case I would use as my primary, it would be an upgrade to my primary, which makes me eligable for CAWU on it, or does it? <p>Tilerin Tidestream<Br>48th season Druid<Br>Twilight Marauders<Br><img src="http://207.206.24.253/til1.jpg" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualenen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>A Lenen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/6/01 6:59:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'd roll on it</span><hr size=1> There are a lot of people who don't know what makes things good to us.

<br>
any time you are dealing with no drop items, you should always look at longevity.  an item that one class would use as primary gear and never upgrade should go to that class first, then other usable classes behind that.  the gloves are ideal for druids who have very few options when it comes to gloves, however you will get competition from chain tanks on those, and from anyone who wants them for resists.  also look at what is available to those people there.  anyone who is hunting vindi or pom, druids have decent gloves from those places also, and can give up the paebala gloves if needed. <p>-K<br>

A druid won the roll and the raid leader said &quot;the preferred classes for this tunic are monks, rogues, ranger&quot; (there were no sk's or necros there) So, the druid passed it over to  the monk who rolled 2nd highest. Now, I completely disagree with this and made my opinion known to the raid leader (not that it made a difference). Personally, at lvl 56 this tunic would have been a great upgrade to the shroud of nature I'm still wearing and it would have been a nice upgrade for the 55 druid that had won the roll. IMO, if the druid was going to wear the tunic she should have had an equal chance as the other classes listed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=faynedethe>Fayne Dethe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/22/01 12:31:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Flayed Paebala not for druids?</span><hr size=1> Hmm people are crazy if they dont think the Flayed Paebla Skin Tunic is good for druids - there are very slim pickings for breastplates for druids that are any good aside from Velious quest ones, and Flayed Paebla is highest AC tunic for druids aside from North wing of ToV/PoM ;p.  I used to wear one all the time until I got ToV BP, and now I use it for resist gear ;p.  I really dont see why a monk would ever want this - it is heavy and the tunic that drops off Lord Dojo is easier to get and far better stats for a monk (lord dojo is a set spawn and seems to drop tunic majority of the time while the paebla drops are incredibly random ;p).  Tunic is quite low AC for all the other melee classes.  Really I could only see druids and necros fighting over it and most necros seem to revert back to robes after wearing tunic for novelty sake for a bit.<br>
<br>
The legs on the other hand is a more contestable issue.  I dont see druids as necessarily one of the best classes for this as there quite a number of easy to obtain and nice alternatives for druid leggings (gladiator and kromnif).  Also, paebla legs would be awesome as resist gear for almost any class as high disease resist items are hard to obtain unlike poison (plus DMF helps alot with achieving decent poison resist making tunic less needed as resist gear). <p>Fayne Dethe<BR>

My opinion.   If you *WILL* use the item on your *MAIN* you can roll for it nuff said.<br>
<br>
To me ANYBODY that tries to start the &quot;you can't roll on this item because it is better for X class&quot; argument is just trying to limit the playing field to improove their chances to win an item.<br>
<br>
I also detest guilds (and will never be a member of one) that for most things operates in the &quot;who can and will use get to lotto for it&quot; then suddenly when an item drops that is either really nice or that an officer wants, the lotto system changes to &quot;arrange&quot; a default winner of their choice.   Seen it happen way to many times.   <br>
