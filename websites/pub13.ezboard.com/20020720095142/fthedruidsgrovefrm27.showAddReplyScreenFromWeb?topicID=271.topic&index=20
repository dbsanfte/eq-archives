So in other words, you are saying that YOU want to pay for other people's stupidity when you buy that cup of coffee, and expect the rest of us to follow suit.  Note that the coffee isn't any safer now; there's just a warning for the idiots and a higher price tag to cover the cost of the lawsuit and more insurance.  Call it a "moron tax" if you will.<br>
<br>
A lot of this could be avoided by simply doing away with juries in most civil cases.  What function do they serve anyway?  They don't understand law or the broader ramifications of the awards they are giving, and they only serve to perpetuate an area of law that is artificially kept alive by huge jury awards.  Don't tell me huge jury awards are necessary to keep society in line, because apparently every country outside of the United States seems to do this quite well without resorting to litigation. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 2/13/02 6:03:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utandaina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tandaina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/13/02 8:30:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Have to agree with Tudamorf.<br>

You can't protect people from their own stupidity. You know what coffee is hot. If you spill it you might burn yourself.  You mother teaches you about scalding liquids as a kid for heaven sakes.<br>
<br>
If you buy a cup of coffee and choose to drink it while driving you are taking a risk.  Not only are you taking you rmind off the road you probaby arn't focused on the coffee either. <br>
<br>
A person with even AVERAGE intelligence shouldn't need a warning label on their coffee telling them its hot and could burn them! Sheesh.  We live in a society so wrapped up in law suits and blaming other folks for our own stupidity.  Take responsibility for yourself.<br>
<br>
As for buying items online for games.  I don't know.  I think its a bit cheap. But I agree that you shouldn't have to spend HOURS camping an item to get it.  Not all of us have that sort of time.  On the other hand do  I want to go into RvR against someone who spend hundreds on just hte right equipment. I don't know.  I guess its their choice if that's how they choose to spend their money.   <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn - Warden of Connla<BR>

I've always questioned why we can't counter-sue people for clumsiness.<br>
<br>
If five thousand people walk down my sidewalk per year and one person trips, I would posit that the person who tripped by definition has a proclivity to tripping.  Why should I be held responsible for this?<br>
<br>
What happened to the concept of personal responsibility anyway?   I mean, why can't Micky Dees sue the broad who spilled the coffee for being an idiot?   There is ALWAYS assumed risk in anything that you do.  If you drive and drink coffee in the car, you assumed some risk.  You also increase your risk of getting in an accident.<br>
<br>
Suppose, instead of spilling it on herself, she dropped the coffee and it harmlessly fell on the passenger seat, yet was spilling onto the cloth.  She reaches over to pick up the cup, takes her eyes off the road, and slams her car into a bridge abutment and gets decapitated.   Who's fault is it now?   If it were caught on video tape, there'd probably be a law now that drive-thru's are illegal and some snake lawyer would be negotiating on his second yacht.<br>
<br>
I think there needs to be some legislation put into effect that essentially states. &quot;If you are NOT encapsulated in a steel capsule in a geologically stable region with food, supplies, sewage and air that will last your lifetime then you assume risk doing anything.   If you chose not to accept these risks, please enter your capsule post haste as no one is going to pay your for your own stupidity&quot;<br>

Having said that, my understanding of the evidence introduced at that trial is this:<br>
<br>
1)  McDonald's brewed their coffee about 16-20 degrees hotter than the industry standard. <br>
<br>
2)  The two reasons for doing this were: a) they thought it tasted better; and b) there were fewer refills for patrons who drank their coffee in the store (hotter coffee to longer to drink)<br>
<br>
3)  McDonalds knew that the increased temperature of the coffee was causing more serious burns on those occassions when it was spilled<br>
<br>
4)  Depspite this they decided the lower cost/inreased profit margin was good enough to continue brewing it at higher temperatures<br>
<br>
5)  Most of the verdict was based on punitive damages, which are only awardable based upon conduct which amounts to something more than simple negligence, typically willful, wanton, reckless or intentional conduct. <br>
<br>
6)  While I don't recall the original verdict, it was in the neighborhood of 2.5 million.<br>
<br>
7)  The case occurred in a jurisdiction where culpability on the plaintiff is not a complete defense.  The jury apportions negligence to each party and then the final verdict is reduced by the same percentage of negligence as was attributed to the plaintiff<br>
<br>
8)  The trial judge reduced the jury's verdict on the grounds that he found it excessive to something around $300k<br>
<br>
9)  The judge further reduced her verdict by the percentage that jury attributed to the plaintiff for that event.  <br>
<br>
The jury system will always create results that you don't agree with, but so will any other system in place.  In general I think it does a pretty good job, although I see results all the time I think are wrong.  <br>

<br>
Perhaps, but a bunch of untrained joe-blows are the <i>worst</i> people to have deciding something like punitive damages.  Punitive damages have nothing to do with deciding who's telling the truth or what really happened.  If McDonald's should be punished (and I'm not necessarily saying they should), the person deciding the punishment should be someone intimately familiar with the industry, economics, and the broader ramifications of such awards in the aggregate.  You wouldn't hire joe blow to chair the Federal Reserve Bank or to take over as CEO of a major company, and this is no different.  Also, there is no reason on earth why the plaintiff, or her attorney, should get one cent of that money.<br>

Punitive damages are considered taxable income under IRS regulations.  So to the extent the verdict provided punitives, that portion would be taxable.  Just a further FYI.  <br>

<br>
So?  The plaintiff is still getting about 33% of the it and the plaintiff's attorney is getting about 17% it.  If someone just dropped $10 million in your lap for being a total idiot, would you really start complaining that the actual award was $20 million?  I think not, you'd take the money and run, realizing you nearly stole that money as you didn't deserve it.  I don't think either the plaintiff or the attorney should get $0.01 of punitive damages.<br>
<br>
To put it differently, if it's truly "punitive", it should be a fine, and collected for the benefit of everyone.  The current system is sort of like paying your speeding ticket directly to the police officer who arrested you (for his personal use) instead of to a court.  Do you think that would be a good system? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaurincotg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saurin CoTG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/13/02 12:17:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Tuda I was not trying to argue the issue for or against your point, just supplying some additional information.  However, if I were to argue the point it would go something like this. . . (all in good fun and playing devil's advocate here :-))  I actually think there are some very good sound policy reasons that support your position. <br>
<br>
From a policy/PR perspective this particular case is a bad example to argue as to why the plaintiff/attorney recieve some benefit from the punitive damage award, so I am going to change it up on you for just a second and use the Ford Pinto case.  <br>
<br>
Back in the 70s the Pinto had a dangerous habit of exploding when rearended at even low and moderate speeds.  Why?  Well the design of the car had a metal rod which would puncture the gas tank with moderate body damage causing the explosion.  <br>
<br>
Now in order to prove their case, the plaintiff had to spend a substantial amount of money in costs. (court costs, expert witness fees, testing and so on) Costs in these matters are not recoverable, nor do you get to inform the jury of what they are or how much they are and if you lose or your verdict is not sufficient to cover them, you eat those costs.  In a motor vehicle product liablity claim, those costs can easily be several hundred thousand dollars.  So there can be a significant degree of risk associated with the plaintiff bringing the claim in the first place and thus the benefit accrues to the person that engaged in that risk. (so the argument goes)  <br>
<br>
Now you may not agree with it, and that is fine, many people don't.  The realities are, however, that punitive damage are rarely awarded and even more rarely upheld (there are Constitutional restraints on punitive awards), but when they happen they tend to get a lot of press.  <br>

You do not own anything when you play MMOG's, it is clearly stated as such in the end users liscence agreement for mmog's. Since what is on your char, and even your char, are all intellectual property of the developer. As such, this reasoning about how one charges for ones time is moot. Your time might equal $$$ for you but you are still selling of a companies intellectual property to someone else, be they a player of that game or not.<br>

VI had a little problem trying to clue in EBay, until they realised this corporation has a fairly substantial legal team backing them and I doubt the same could be said of EBay or their legal team realised they were &quot;screwed&quot;. The outcome will be no different than the VI/EBay. These &quot;salespeople&quot; agree to the same terms we all agree to and are bound by it. Some lawyer realised he'd make a nice chunk of change even if it was only his fees on a loss. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=griifrine>Griifrine</A> at: 2/13/02 7:34:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalbor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malbor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid in Absentia<br>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 10:07:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/malbor/malbor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> <br>

Not True.  I'm not selling the little data bits off of Mythic's computers.  I'm selling my access rights to those bits.   The rights to those bits are awarded to me via access fees.  <br>
<br>
I really don't see what the big deal is.  I don't buy or sell anything on Ebay, but frankly, who gives a rats ass anyway.   If I had never once heard of Ebay and unless someone told me, I could spend 10 years in DAoC, EQ, AC, etc and still not be able to objectively quantify how exactly it is that Ebay affects my character.   No one can, they conjecture, theorize and claim it's bad, it causes camping, it does this it does that.  They can't prove it causes anything, no one can. I think Ebay is just a nice friendly scapegoat to lump all the ills of the world upon.<br>

What some people fail to realize is that demand will always exceed supply.   When supply exceeds demand, demand disappears.  This means that coveted items will ALWAYS be camped if they are campable.  ALWAYS.   Ending Ebay won't end trading of items or characters, there will always be a medium of exchange.<br>
<br>
The argument 'well, they don't deserve it, I did it legitimately and camped  the frenzied for 36 hours straight myself' doesn't hold much water either.   It comes down to people comparing themselves to others constantly.  I can't stand in town in AC for more than 5 minutes without at least one person examining me.    People seem to want to &quot;be better than the other guy&quot;.   Frankly though, someone else having the ultimate sword of whoop-ass doesn't detract from my accomplishment of beating Bael Zha'ron naked in the slightest.   The moment I'm more concerned about what someone else has or  how they got it, is the moment I've given over my locus of control to others, why on Earth/Norrath/Dereth/Etc would anyone do that?   *shakes head*<br>
<br>
I've never figured out why people care.   Try this experiment.  Make a character in whatever game, talk to the fewest people possible and level them from 1 to 50/60/126 and make no mention of Ebay or trading or whatever.  When done come back here and quantitatively state how it was that Ebay affected your game?   Bet you won't be able to state one example of where it affected you.  Oh and anecdotal 'We went to the hand and it was camped, so it must be Ebay' doesn't work.<br>

You're not? Wow didn't realise all that data was stored client side :rolleyes: And as stated above, you have no rights to those &quot;bits&quot;, since those bits are mythic's intellectual property. All your fees allocate to you is the ability to store your &quot;data&quot; in their database, and again that data does not belong to you since mythic is in charge of that database not the player.<br>
<br>
It's still remarkably assinine to purchase DAoC items due to decay. What is the point? As for selling accounts, they take the same stance that VI/SoE do, it's not allowed and accounts have allready been banned due to attempted sales. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalbor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malbor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid in Absentia<br>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/14/02 3:36:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/malbor/malbor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
I never said they were stored clientside.<br>
<br>
<br>
The following statement is in direct contridiction to the one below.<br>
&gt;&gt;And as stated above, you have no rights to those &quot;bits&quot;, since those bits are mythic's intellectual property.<br>
<br>
Ok, no rights to them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; All your fees allocate to you is the ability to store your &quot;data&quot; in their database,&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Now we have rights to them.  You and YOUR indicate ownership of a right.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;and again that data does not belong to you since mythic is in charge of that database not the player.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
And again, I don't claim ownership to the data.  I claim ownership to the right to access that data.  That right is what is in contention here.<br>
<br>
Here's a metaphor.   I buy a ticket to a baseball game.  I now have a right to access that football game.  I am allowed to sell that right to another person as long as I don't exceed the face value of the ticket.   I don't own the players, I don't own the stadium, but I do own the right to be there and the right to consume what's there(i.e. game)<br>

<br>
Which you are if you sell items from your account or your account. Where else do you think it's stored other than their databases?<br>
<br>
&quot;Now we have rights to them. You and YOUR indicate ownership of a right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Language that I use does not indicate a right nor ownership. You pay for &quot;storage&quot; you don't pay for anything else. YOU can access that data to your hearts content, not anyone else...you.<br>
<br>
And metaphors like the one you used are never a great way to try to get a point accross because it's all apples and oranges. You don't, in essence, digitally sign your rights away on certain aspects of the game when you enter the park or buy a ticket, or at least I have never had to sign a waiver to get into a ballgame. EULA is an agreement, that states in pretty clear legal terms what you can and can't do with any mmog. In EQ you agree to it every time you login. Although I play on Pendragon, so I don't see the EULA popups as much as when I login to a production server, but you also have to agree with this at least once in DAoC to even gain access to login. But by even installing the software (client) you agree to the TOS and EULA, that my friend is legally binding. And again is why I don't understand how other than some greedy assed lawyer needing to make some quick cash, this case even made it this far. It's a waste of court time and it's a waste of the peoples tax money that pay for the legal system to operate so imbeciles can sue each other over the most mundane and assinine reasons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27>General - DAOC</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
