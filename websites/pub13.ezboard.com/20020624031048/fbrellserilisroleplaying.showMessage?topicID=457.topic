<br>
ogre 1: ah we gut un <br>
ogre 2: dads gut cause me very hungry I says we et im now (I found this bit rather worrying but nothing I hadn't encountered before I must point out)<br>
ogre 3: hey deres musrums in der basket we can eats dem too<br>
ogre 2: me no like baskets tem got da bits dat get stuck between me teet<br>
ogre 3: not da basket yu stupid ogre dem musrums<br>
ogre 2: oh those squissy thingies that go on dem posh sandwiches<br>
ogre 1: ya know we ken stuff dem gnomy wit da mushrooms<br>
ogre 2: yah, my mum always made stuffed froglok anna she put da stuffing up da frogloks bum (at this point I was starting to get really really REALLY worried)<br>
ogre 3: yu stupid orribel ogre I'm not gonna put my hand up gnomy bum dads very unhyginical ding yu just feed da musrums to da gnomy like dey do with da goose<br>
ogre 1: okay me can do dat<br>
<br>
At this point the first ogre firmly tucked me under one arm and started to force feed me the mushroom and I had to swallow them if I didn't want to choke (I swear I will never eat foie grass again) and he continued doing so until the basket was empty upon which they firmly bonded and gagged me so they could make the preparations for their meal and I was left to myself and while I was seeking for a way to escape I was starting to feel a bit dizzy and this feeling only increased and I started to feel strangely exhilarated and then I noticed my nose starting to turn green but the last thing I remember was the sound of tearing cloth and breaking ropes but after this I must have had a blackout because I really can't remember what happened next all I know is that I came around wearing just some tattered shorts and feeling very tired also I was surrounded with bits of my former cloths, all ripped open at the seams and at first there was no sign of my assailants until I heard a whimpering sound that I could not locate until I looked up and saw all three ogres at the top of a big tree where they started screaming when they saw<br>
me looking at them and they attempted to get even higher into the tree well I just picked up my belongings and made a quick departure before they came to realize that whatever scared them up that tree but forgot about me was gone and that I had escaped<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS I had my pet chop down the tree a bit later it made a very pleasant scream when it went down <br>
