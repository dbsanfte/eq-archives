<br>
That's what you said over on KTF's boards.  I brought it here because those boards are specifically NOT for flames and the like (although you've chosen to insult numerous people with your comments).<br>
<br>
Who the fvck are you?  You think you are somebody?  You are the epitome of nobody.  You surround yourself with the trappings of a person of note, but the only note you play is a minor seventh chord.<br>
<br>
Some of those "nobodies" who enjoy the rotations of these mobs, are starting to kill the early NToV dragons - did you ever do that prior to hanging out with DD, Eryl?  Somehow I doubt it, since you've never lead a failed raid, right?<br>
<br>
Or did you instead just print out pictures of them and hang them up next to those of your non-namesake (you know, the ones over your bed...)?<br>
<br>
These "nobodies" are *current* Guild and Raid leaders who are trying to deal with the current situation as best they can, without the worthless dribble that you have to contribute causing them any more hassles.<br>
<br>
It's the holidays, Eryl, something that I trust even a dimwit such as yourself has noticed.  Thus, there are many people away or otherwise busy who would normally be playing.  That means that the ability to hold out against FCFS is reduced.  If you want to flame some guilds for adjusting rotations schedules because of Christmas, cast you mind back 1 year and then flame Unity, KTF and EA.  Yup, flame us for understand that real life and real family comes before a computer game.<br>
<br>
How is it you've become familiar with the recruitment rates of Stasis?  Been following them and considering your own options, eh?  It stands to reason - you are, after all, a petulant child. <p><i><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1764>

You dont have to agree but that is how I feel and so I said it.<br>
<br>
I stopped reading your little rant because it quickly seemed to not understand what I was talking about.  Maybe you and a few others need to stop flying off the handles, I myself am sick of the rotations and the results they are giving.  <br>
<br>
The rotation is making life easy on Stasis, and fostering this image that they are so strong and thriving in a FCFS environ when there is no FCFS environment.<br>
<br>
They have 1 guild to compete against, when 15 should be.  Wake up, realize what is going on and then talk to me.<br>
<br>
Almost forgot, Christmas?  I am at work now, not really a christmas at the moment.  <p><br>

I went to the KTF board and read the entire thread. I really think you are taking Eryl's post the wrong way.<br>
<br>
I took it as he is saying that everyone is respecting the rotation and they are being penalized for it because of the FCFS guilds who have no competition.<br>
<br>
I don't see anywhere that he claims to know the recruitment of Stasis. The situation of guilds missing their chance for the mobs and Stasis getting several in a row is causing many guilds to lose their high level players to the FCFS guilds. It may not be right, but it is reality. And it doesnt take a brain surgeon to figure it out when you see people in KTF, Unity, SA, CC, EA one day and Stasis the next.<br>
<br>
Everyone has the right to play the game the way that makes it fun for them.<br>
<br>
Technically, the GM's only support a FCFS basis. I could be mistaken about this one, but I am pretty sure that is the only thing they honor.<br>
<br>
So if you have all the guilds on the rotation following the rotation and taking turns, and one or two guilds are going in under FCFS and taking the mob from those on the rotation, then what good is the rotation? It is only hurting those who are being respectul and trying to adhere to it.<br>
<br>
If all those on the rotation would do away with it and also FCFS those mobs, then the one or two guilds who are currently FCFSing would have competition and not be getting 2 or 3 in a row.<br>
<br>
I dont think Eryl was flaming anyone, and most definitely not those using the rotation. I think you really misunderstood.<br>
<br>
And where does he say anything about Christmas? Or even adjusting the schedules today? Or even this week? Or even next week? Where did he flame anyone for adjusting rotation schedules during the holidays? All he did was state what he felt regarding the situation. The exact same thing everyone else in the thread was doing.<br>
<br>
Perhaps it could have been worded a bit better. But it is hardly fitting to flame like you did. Especially when you make a point to flame him for it being Christmas when you are doing even worse on the same day....and all because you misunderstood the post and didnt have the maturity to simply ask what it meant before you over reacted.   <br>
<br>
I honestly would have exected much better from someone who has played so long. <br>

<br>
Perhaps you should have read Creac's post a little closer.  When he mentioned Christmas it had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> nothing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do with how Eryl should act.  He only pointed out that it's Christmas time and people do not have the time they did before, for obvious reasons.  <br>
<br>
As for flaming on Christmas... guess you haven't noticed that people really don't care what time of year it is to choose how they act.  Christmas is supposed to be this happy time of the year - have you been out lately?  Just how many people do you see actually happy and cheery?  Most everybody is just bitter, pissed off, mad, frustrated, and in a hurry for this season to be over.  It's no longer this happy, cheery, fun time of year.  Just a more significant day to reflect back upon all the bad stuff that has happened this past year and years before.<br>
<br>
And it's no longer Christmas Day for Creac.  Hasn't been for a while.  He's nearly 18 hours ahead of US time, not that that should be relevant at all.  <br>
<br>
As for if Creac had reason to flame Eryl - check out the rest of the threads in this forum.  Even if Creac did misunderstand Eryl's post or didn't - it doesn't matter, it's a Rant Forum... if somebody sneezes in the wrong direction people can rant about it.  <br>
<br>
Oh yea, before I forget.  As for Creac's &quot;maturity&quot; on how he reacted to the situation - if you've seen any other threads you'll know that Eryl and Creac have gone at eachother before.  But don't you dare sit there for one second and judge Creac for reacting the way he did.  I don't believe anybody died and left you to do so.  <br>
<br>
Then again, go ahead and judge him.  Think what you would like of Creac.  Meanwhile, the people who do know him will get a good laugh at the people who don't but choose to think they may have even the smallest insight of who he is.  <br>
<br>
There you go, take it as you will.  For the record, I played for over two years - should you have expected more?   <br>

Officially, noone has quit KTF to go to &quot;greener pastures&quot; in Stasis. Well, other than the ones who ebayed their accounts and the new owner is now using that character in Stasis. I dont think many other guilds also have seen people get up and leave to go to Stasis because they are so FCFS powerful heh.

anyways.. eryl,<br>
we dont brag about killing trak do we? not that i have seen.. we have our reasons for killing trivial mobs we dont do it for the hell of it.<br>
<br>
and if you refer to stasis as a bunch of noobs or nobodies or whatever ya wanna call us just think twice about the facts instead of your opinions.  I dont like to brag at all..  but go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.stasisprexus.com">www.stasisprexus.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->  just read up on our news every few days or so and check out the stuff we do.<br>
nobodies cant do just about everything we do..(thought horror overfiend,even the pre-nerf itraer Vius )  yes Trak is trivial but we dont brag about having to kill the pos over and over in order to get into another zone.<br>
<br>
nobodies cant stick together and play how they want having tons of fun and accomplishing alot even if they are defying a whole server.<br>
<br>
Stasis people are people too.. they have jobs and lives as well..  we are not nobodies..<br>
<br>
why would you call us nobodies Eryl?  im curious for a valid reason as to why you would call Stasis nobodies.<br>
<br>
what is a nobody?<br>
are you a somebody eryl?  and why?<br>

if you werent refering to us as the nobodies in your post then im sorry for goin overboard with the whole thing.. i just really wonder sometimes.<br>

<br>
I honestly believe that Eryl's post was completely misunderstood, and I stand by that.  Should he have worded it differently? Yes. Is his opinion wrong? No. It is an opinion.  There are no such things as right and wrong opinions.  And honestly, his is an opinion I happen to agree with.<br>
<br>
I believe Creac thought Eryl was calling those who do use the rotation nobodies.  But he is not.  He was referring to those who are FCFSing and ruining the rotation for all of the guilds who are following it.  And he was making a point that as long as guilds are going to FCFS in the middle of the rotation or even calendar for that matter, then those methods are useless.  In the case of the rotations (because of certain guilds chosing to use FCFS), all guilds would benefit from doing away with the rotation method and going to FCFS for those mobs.  <br>
<br>
As for judging, I judge no one.  I do not know Creac.  He could be a mass murderer or even a priest for all I know.  It doesnt really matter because I will likely never know him as RL person.  I only know his online persona.  I do believe he was imature in this particular post.  No one is perfect.  We all make mistakes.  I felt he misinterpreted what Eryl said, so I spoke up.<br>

I respect you for standing up for your friend.  But just as he misunderstood Eryl's post, I believe you have misunderstood the intent of mine.  And, no, I did not expect more from you.  <br>

<br>
Eryl didn't read my entire post (his own words) and then chose to comment.  You can draw your own conclusions as to the validity of any comments he makes.<br>
<br>
Eryl didn't start a discussion, he started a flame.  Read his very first sentence.  Launching a verbal attack (albeit a rather bathetic one), is not the way to start a serious discussion.  I know we might normally excuse Eryl for not knowing this because he's a dipshit, but I think the time for excusing his behaviour is long since past.<br>
<br>
Stasis hadn't FCFSed all that much since their initial onslaught.  The run up to Christmas, with fewer people available because of RL functions and such, has seen them able to take a few spawns.  It's annoying and it's childish on their part - they want their toys now damnit and they won't share.  Such is life.<br>
<br>
Moving to full FCFS would simpy deny many people, through no fault of their own (ie no lack of skill), the opportunity to play certain parts of the game.<br>
<br>
Livi - I don't know who you are, but I'll start off and say nice to meet you.  That said, I think it's important to correct a few of your more glaring errors (I can't correct them all - I have things to do next year...).<br>
<br>
Read Eryl's comments again.  Read his very first line.  Tell me that's not a flame?  Referring to people as "nobodies".  OK, he was referring to Stasis, but then he goes on to admonish the "whining" that comes from the FCFSing and thus is attacking those who complain about it.<br>
<br>
Livi, he then goes on to say that he's seen people join Stasis - well how would he know that unless he's followed their recruitment?  Come on now, a little logic goes a long way.<br>
<br>
As for people leaving guild for Stasis?  Please name a single Unity or KTF character who has done this (and is still being played by the original owner - ie not a Ebay character).  You can't.  Thanks for lending so much credence to your arguement...<br>
<br>
As for what the GMs and Guides will do - I could bore you at length with what they will do, but it has no impact on this matter.<br>
<br>
Eryl said nothing about Christmas, but most of the recent posts concerning this issue have raised the matter of lacking of number because of the holiday season.  Typically, Eryl has failed to take this into account in his comments.  Therefore I referred him to a previous Christmas in which Unity, KTF and EA agreed to make allowances in the rotation.  It might be hard for you to grasp this concept, since you seem to support Eryl, but I was providing some contructive reference and additional material.<br>
<br>
Eryl has displayed his lack of taste for such things in an earlier thread about his name.  There he quoted from www.everquest.com in support of his arguement, but failed to quote (from the very same section of the page) the portion that showed his arguement to be false.  When challenged on this, he became silent.<br>
<br>
I didn't flame Eryl for it being Christmas.  If you're going to refer to things I have said, at least make some basic attempt to understand it.<br>
<br>
What's more, why should Christmas be different to any other day?  Dawn makes a very salient point about the lack of good will that seems to abound at the moment.<br>
<br>
Why is it that we need to be peaceful on Christmas Day?  Should we be peaceful every other day of the year?  If our entire view is that we need special days such as Christmas in order to behave peacefully or with good will, then we are doomed.<br>
<br>
Let me quote John Lennon.  "So this is Christmas, and what have you done, another year over, another just begun".  Exactly - what have you done or what has anyone done?  We need to be thinking about getting it right every other day of the year, not just one (it's the 26th December here, BTW, as Dawn pointed out).  Lennon also wrote in that song "war is over, if you want it".  And my isn't that just the most insightful thing that's been written in a long time.  *if you want it*.  Think about that before discussing the matter of being peaceful over Christmas.<br>
<br>
Finally, Livi, as Dawn asked, what does the length of time I've played have to do with any of these matters?<br>
<br>
Eryl - name some of the KTF and Unity people, who are original owners, who have moved to Stasis.  Please.<br>
<br>
Well, I had enough of a chortle at all this whilst there's been breaks in the cricket because of rain.  Off to see LotR in about 90 minutes.  Flame back if you want, but please do me a favour and make it worth reading? (or at the very least base your comments on a few facts!) <p><i><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1764>

Simple, they talk big, claiming how they will FCFS you all!! But have no competition.  You are not a FCFS guild like you say you are.  You are scavengers, that if Venril and Trak were not on rotations Stasis would get very few of them.<br>
<br>
I wish we had it as easy as you Stooge, where we could walk in when all the rest of the server will do nothing at all because they respect an agreement you do not.  You are weak, you can't do any thing but bottom feed. <p><br>

And Creac has a right to disagree with Eryl's opinion and come here and post about it, right?  I can see how Eryl calling somebody a nobody is okay, but when Creac calls Eryl a few names it's immature. <br>

I think Creac touched about everything else!<br>

WE DONT..  we dont believe in the rotations.. we kill mobs if they are up... this isnt anything new<br>
<br>
We fcfs trak because we want VP keys..  call us impatient.. but we arent nobodies..  we dont talk big about killing trak.. in fact we fvckin hate having to kill the PoS to get into a new zone.<br>
<br>
 that is not a valid reason at all for calling us nobodies..   i dont see where we brag about killing trak and VS all the time..   <br>
<br>
  the only thing we talk big about is when we drop mobs like Itraer Vius(prenerf) Thought horror overfiend.. thats just SoL..  not to mention all the velious things we have taken down...  zland kland sontalak telk gozz statue vindi the 10th ring war... not to mention the joint raids with unity killin almost everything we havent alone like tormax, ST raids.. <br>
ya we got 12 ST keys.<br>
<br>
and yet.. we still dont come out and brag about it..  nobody cares what we do. and we dont care what people think about out accomplishments and failures..<br>
<br>
<br>
and about the competition thing... we never said we went Fcfs for competiton.   for one reason....we went Fcfs because we are sick of having to wait months to get into VP..   which is pretty much going to be a trivial zone when we get all our keys done.  other reasons are too hard to explain in posts.. nobody seems to understand us, but its ok.<br>
<br>
<br>
  dude you have no valid reason for calling us nobodies.. for calling us weak.. for calling us noobs.. or whatever.<br>
<br>
  forget trak and VS for a second.. realize that WE KNOW THEY ARE TRIVIAL POS MOBS...   WE DONT FCFS FOR COMPETITION..  <br>
<br>
look at our other accomplishments.. and call us nobodies bud. <br>
<br>
ill say it again...your all opinion and little fact.<br>
<br>
<br>
and i still want to know how your a somebody if we are nobodies?  <br>
<br>
i know im in no position to argue on prexus.com because im an officer in a guild that pretty much defy's this server's wishes even tho alot of people dont realize where stasis is coming from and why they really do the things they do.....and i understand you will most likely always be back for the last word...  but you lost this one pal.<br>

Get your little peons to shut the hell up about how tough and bad Stasis is when they have no competition and maybe I wouldn't call them all nobodies.  I don't care either way, the server is about to fall into FCFS status which will likely hurt Stasis, the competition will make it hard I am sure. <p><br>

i do not like leaving threads with heated posts i guess<br>
<br>
i would like examples of people braging about us killing Trak or VS..<br>
<br>
yes soon the server will prolly fall to fcfs or something.. who knows...   and your assumption that it will hurt stasis is a little off hehe..   <br>
we have enough to raid VP and clear it now.. its a matter of time and pos camps to finish.. and a good night to do VP.. which will prolly be soon after the holidays..<br>
<br>
i just dont see where you get that we think we are all bad for killing VS and Trak alot..  we dont look for competition first of all..<br>
yes all guilds have their guild clowns.. who will always talk a bunch of crap or whatever...  but i honestly dont remember seeing people from Stasis brag about taking down VS and Trak and acting like tough guys.. lol even i think thats kinda dumb to brag about....  it is fact that trakanon and venril sathir are trivial mobs to stasis.<br>
<br>
the server going Fcfs wouldnt hurt Stasis one bit to tell you the truth... Stasis's main goals happen to be mobs that are already Fcfs.. and mobs that most guilds can't kill regularly.. with the exception for 2 guilds =)   dude we really arent the noobs people think we are.. we have some high expectations and we have failed things alot in order to accomplish much more.<br>
<br>
we would still get the occasional trak here and there for teeth for new members and for our lower level guildies that will level sooner or later..etc...  would get the occasional VS for the wizards that wants their epic's..   we would probably get the same amount of trak's and VS's as we were getting when we were on the rotation a while back.  <br>
<br>
nobody acts like a badass for fcfs'ing things on a rotation..  we never even successfully killed CT or Dain..and in my opinion as a raid officer in Stasis we could.   and they are both rotation mobs... still rotated regularly... and someday we will try again and again until we get it right..  we have come too close in the past to not have those battles under our belts.<br>
<br>
so to end this post..<br>
<br>
-Stasis did not go fcfs for the competition<br>
-Stasis are not nobodies <br>
-the server turning FCFS would not hurt Stasis<br>
-Stasis has no right to brag about fcfsing trak and VS since we have no competiton and they are trivial mobs to us.   yes i admit this =)  and still would like to see examples of members of stasis braging or acting like they are tough guys because of this,....because i dont even think our guild clowns even care to brag about that kinda stuff.. its not even something to brag about.<br>
<br>
those are the facts<br>
<br>
and like i said before everyone has their opinions of stasis.<br>
wont get into those =)  heard most of them already in the last couple of months =P.<br>

<br>
Creac - First, thank you for coming back and explaining your intent in further detail.  Now I understand a bit better, even if you did have to result to insults.<br>
<br>
I simply felt that you did not understand Eryl's post.  After reading your more detailed post, I understand what you were attempting to say.  And I honestly think the two of you have many of the same views on this issue, and of course some that differ.  There is a lack of understanding because of past arguements and current frustrations.  Too sad.<br>
<br>
We do seem to agree on the effect that a few guilds FCFSing mobs which the remainder of guilds are trying to rotate has on everyone.  We just have different opinions on what should/will happen, and that is fine.  That's why they are called opinions.  And I do respect your right to your own opinion, even if I don't agree with your approach.<br>
<br>
