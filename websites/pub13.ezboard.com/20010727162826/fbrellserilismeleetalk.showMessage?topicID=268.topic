<br>
Since Verant has blown us off again, I'm seriously thinking of retiring my bard and choosing another class.  Just wanted to let my friends know that I'll be hard to find for the next few days; and maybe forever.  Just have some thinking to do.<br>

<br>
I see only the following problems with bards as a whole.<br>
        1. I can't really camp much of anything. Even that silly ogre camp whacks me silly<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
        2. I pretty much stink at soloing...the whole kiting thing is just tooo boreing.<br>
        3. My hand tends to go numb after 3-4 hours of grouping and my brain soon follows.<br>
        4. My exp bar is permanently broken..at least I think it is.<br>
        5. My 51st song makes me run faster then anything in Norrath...but no one can see me as I am also invisible<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
        <br>
<br>
However, I also see the following as being what makes good bards incredible..<br>
        1. I can't camp crap so I never get a bad rep as a farmer and no lil kiddies want to be bards cause they can't camp crap. You'll also prob ever see my name ranted for KS'ing anyone.<br>
        2. I get to group all the time since I can't solo and I have the privilage of meeting some of the best people in the game. People who can solo often miss out on this part of the game.<br>
        3. My hand and brain are constantly getting stronger due to the immense amount of training i have been putting in.<br>
        4. My exp and most other bard expometers are broken. This scares away all the people who just want to PL and not enjoy the whole exp of EQ.<br>
        5. My lvl 51 song does have invis which is a good thing, because if i was smacked running that fast that high in the DL I would definately fall to my death.<br>
<br>
Honestly, as far as I can see the bard class is the hardest and most painstaking class to play. The whole twisting thing is a lot harder then people percieve.  I see this as a good thing. The high lvl bards in the Brell Community are generally some of the most dedicated, kindest and most helpful people you will find. <br>
<br>
It's funny, out of the blue I get a tell from Kalysre who I have not had the pleasure of meeting yet, and he grats me on making 50. I am lucky enough to win Naggies drum the other night and first tell I get is from Katran heckling me. It is this type of attitude that makes being a bard better then being another class. The bards are definately their own community. <br>
<br>
So please Tatter don't give up. See the class's difficulty as being a good thing. I'd be willing to bet that most of the super twinked bards below lvl 30 &lt;who have better armor then me at 51..errrrr&gt; never make it to the lvl you have attained<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1) Bards were the only class that could regen mana.  Enchanters never had clarity all through Beta.  It was a bone they were thrown as they were perceived to be a &quot;Broken&quot; class.  This reduced the importance of Bards in groups.<br>
<br>
2) Lucid Lullaby could stop a train cold.  It worked great.  Then GZ announces that a secondary resist is being implemented on the song.....but don't worry it only affects 32+ level MOB's.  Song is forevermore broken. The same secondary resist is added to Pixie Strike, thus crippling a Bards ability to do Crowd Control with anything other than Charm.<br>
<br>
3) Selos was horribly nerfed as it used to break root which was called a bug by Verant.  Also a speed cap was placed in the game which nerfed high level Bards with Naggy Drum.<br>
<br>
4) Consonant Chain was mistakenly broken when the fix for Strane went in. Verant says it was an accident and they will fix it. 4 months later song is declared too powerful and is now working as intended. Funny it made it through beta and over 1 year on live servers without a single complaint.<br>
<br>
5) Bards were promissed by GZ that we would be the only class able to buff an entire party at one time.  No other casters would be allowed to do this.  Well you can see were we are now to find out how bad Bards got the shaft on that promise.<br>
<br>
6) The haste component on Verses of Victory was stealth nerfed by Verant and never admitted to.<br>
<br>
I could go on but what is the point.  I play what Verant gives me.  The day I no longer enjoy my Bard is the day I quit EQ. Simple as that. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

/agree Kulanae<br>
<br>
Aye what made me stick to my Bard is the fact that they are prolly the hardest class to play. I got 3 50 plus chars on Brell but NONE of the other classes comes even close to the difficulty level of playing a Bard. Yes they r nerved, yes I wouldnt mind some enhancements but Im also proud that I made it past 50 and still enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
So stand proud and think about it... when tanks regen hps... when casters regen mana... (and therefore do nothing)<br>
.. what are we doing? Twisting Nivs, Hymn and Clarity. So playing a Bard well means CONSTANT action. The day I ether break my fingers or want lay back and just watch my screen will be the day I quit playing my Bard. <br>

<br>
Lullaby used to be a litte too powerful when a bard could mes 20 mobs at once using no mana and relatively little threat so they nerfed it.  Unfortunately they went a little too far and now its almost useless.<br>
<br>
Selos used to break root, but I dont think that it was ever designed to break root, it was just a side effect so they decided to fix it.  The speed cap was a bummer.  I had a selos drum at level 50 before and after the fix and there was only a small drop off in speed but it was enough to upset alot of bards.  This was done because &quot;players movement rates&quot; were client side and not server side and people were hacking the program to make them as fast as they wanted.<br>
<br>
I never remember Verant saying they would fix the chain nerf.  I seem to recall them saying that the nerf was accidental and that they would look in to it.  Of course upon investigating they discovered it was too powerful and that they would not revese the accidental nerf.  I think what bugs most bards is that Verant found the bug accidentally and decided to keep it in place even though they just happen to stumble upon it rather then there being alot of complaints.<br>
<br>
I am also not sure about the haste nerf on VoV.  I know there was a lot of discussion on a downgrade in VoV but there was never anything concrete offered for evidence.  Im not saying it did or didnt happen, I just never saw anyone with statistical evidence proving one way or the other.  VoV has always had a lower haste % then SLTW.<br>
<br>
*  Some other nerfs include the DDD.  That didnt always have a mana component.  It used to be re-castable.  <br>
*  Charm was capped based on level of monster.<br>
*  And there have been a number of temporary nerfs that we have had to live with because Verant did not anticipate the effetcs on bards when making large who scale changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all Bards are fine and I am happy with the changes they are working on.  Especially the Bard FA, SS BP, SS Pants and boots, as well as fixing alot of bugs that have been around since day 1.  The few things I would vote to see change with the bard class are...<br>
<br>
Specialization:  Bard should be able to pick 1 class of songs (Perc, String, wind, brass) and speicalize in it.  You dont read stories of bards being great in 4 different instruments.  Around level 35 bards should be able to pick which way they want to go with their songs.  Songs would do more dmg or more healing or lower resist rates when you specialize in that class of songs.  Of course you would also need more wind and brass songs to balance this out.<br>
<br>
Better DD's:  We dont have to be uber nukers, but I think we should have better DD's.  The problem is the no mana clause.  Since we dont use mana, its hard to give us any DD of power.  But I think bards are more capable at magic then rangers, yet their DD's as well as some of their spells are considerably more powerful than a bards.<br>
<br>
Useless skills:  We have such a wide range of skills with such low caps they are rarely used.  Forage, Sneak, Hide, Lockpicking, Safe Fall, Disarm traps, Instill doubt, throwing, and meditate, all need to be raised or replaced.  Each of these skills even when maxed serve little or no benefit to the bard.<br>
<br>
Like most classes, bards have some nice features and a few places they could use some work.  All in all I would have to say Bards are fine.  Now, I have experimented with other classes but Bard is the only class I have played past 20.  Its also the class I will continue to play.<br>

<br>
I used to think that a bard was hard to play; I'm not so sure anymore.  Why?  Every class which uses a spell in some form has to choose which 8 to load in their gem slots.  Typically, your group and environment will drive to you select certain spells for these slots.  Timing...Spell classes all have a timing issue in one form or another.  Nukers have to allow aggro lists to build and nuke toward the end of fights.  Healers have to know how to time their spells.  Bards have to be able to twist.  It all boils down to timing.  Twisting is mostly limited to lag, imho.  Healing can have the same trouble.  So I don't claim to play the hardest class anymore.<br>
<br>
Bards are versatile though.  Be can plug holes in ANY group.  Shoot, I've even been the healer in a Karnor's group before.  Talk about fun.  We get to do a little bit of everything.  We just can't do any of it very well.  Which can be fine.<br>
<br>
Bards have got to be the toughest class to balance though,  due to our no mana use.  That is a very dangerous combination.  Being able to strike at distance, relatively safely, and with no downtime.  If they were to strengthen our distance strikes, DDs and such, we would be too powerful.<br>
<br>
The one thing I would like to see, if it's not a coding issue, is the ability of our group songs to stack with spells.  I would even be willing to have a line of spells designed specifically for this purpose with lesser pluses.  Especially when it comes to haste.  Keep our current haste songs at their current level, but add a couple of songs which stack with spells but with a lesser haste effect.  That way, instead of (item + spell/song), we could get (item + spell + song.)  This would give us some of our versatility back.<br>
<br>
I would also like to see them work on fixing our vertical aggro range.  I hate using an AE song and pissing off mobs on levels above and below us.  They already have line of sight limitations on our songs, but not on some caster spells.  We even have some of the vertical limitation on us during melee.  Can't hit a mob which is on a slope and is too high or low.  They should be able to do this with our songs.<br>
<br>
On the charm issue, I rely on our 39 charm.  I only have trouble when the mob is higher than I am in level.  Plus there are some mobs which just resist charms in general. <br>
<br>
