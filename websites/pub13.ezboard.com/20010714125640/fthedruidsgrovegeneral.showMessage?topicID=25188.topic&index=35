<br>
At least 6 times.<br>
<br>
Each time, they were EXTREMELY polite, and very helpful.<br>
<br>
Once to report that a quest mob was bugged. GM checked, sure enough my items had vanished. GM replaced items, and apologized. No muss, no fuss. Took 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Got trapped under the world once in that &quot;zoning in Unrest&quot; bug and fell and fell. GM got me out and fixed me. Took about 20-30 minutes. Body was gone, no prob.<br>
<br>
Recently, as a test to see if all the bitching and moaning I hear on the boards was true, I tried an experiment. I reported missing NPCs in Kael twice, and twice via e-mail. One time a guide checked into it, one time a GM. Both times they said yes there was a problem, and that it was being looked at. Each e-mail was responded to by CS rep, and they politely referred me to Ester the Testers' In Development page.<br>
<br>
And, 2 nights ago, in Dragon NEcropolis, a 2nd group who was sort of with us died, and forgot what they did to bodies. Or, forgot where they died. No necros would come summon. They petitoned. Not one but 2 GMs appeared, chatted with us at zone (we had to succor). Remembering my recent test, I figured I'd try the question about NPCs again. GM paused for a bit, and returned and informed me that it was being repaired.<br>
<br>
     So- each time I have had a problem, and have been polite in asking, I personally have never had a bad experience with a VI rep. They assisted me, and they answered my questions. What more can I ask for? This was in the process of normal day-to-day casual gaming. <br>
<br>
Ok, this wasn't power gaming, and it wasn't a big raid in a so-called &quot;uber&quot; zone against an &quot;uber&quot; mob.<br>
<br>
But that being said, there are a lot of us who DO have problems in the normal course a gaming session who DO get help when needed. There are also &quot;uber&quot; guilds who are successful in these areas who have been able to do so without bad experiences with GMs (Paradigm on Sol Ro for example). <br>
<br>
So, as fun and satisfying as it is to repeatedly bash a faceless enitity, or &quot;The MAn,&quot; (ie- Verant), remember that there ARE people how there who have had good experiences. I don't care how many people complain. One angry guild or a few angry people on a public BBS is NOT indicitive of a population of 300,000+.<br>
<br>
Just a little perspective for you.<br>

And this is because, they are typically unhelpful.<br>
<br>
I can't remember when was the last time I called a Guide/GM in game.  I find it more relaxing and less stressful to simply lick my wounds and go on even If I THINK it was bug.  I have had items poofing while zoning, bags disappearing while trading and never got anything replaced. However, that has never been my beef with VI.<br>
<br>
My problem has been that it virtually impossible to resolve small problems via email.  I posted earlier that I had been billed for 6 accounts although I owned only 5.  I sent out email to correct this and got caught in a loop of emails for about 5 weeks.  I would supply all the information and they would ask for more. I would do it again and get the identical &quot;canned&quot; email back.<br>
<br>
I finally called LONG DISTANCE from overseas and stayed 45 minutes on hold to discuss the problem. It was solved in 5 minutes and I had indeed the pleasure to talk to a very polite young man.  However, the billing reappeared the following month.  During the same converstaion, I tried to update the REGISTRATION information and I was told that it was not possible but that this information was not relevant.  The CST informed me that the original information or the original CD key was not important for maintaining your account.  Well, that was obviously WRONG information as in case of a lost pw, VI will send a new one to the REGISTERED email - versus the current one in your station info. Good luck to talk your way out of that mess!<br>
<br>
This is an example of CST mismanagement. VI should have all this billing information ONLINE and allow people to make changes to THEIR personal information.  Oh well, I almost forgot that, according, to VI's vision, we lost the right to our personal life when we signed up for EQ. <br>
<br>

<br>
Time and again, veRant's laughable idea of customer service has been rude, inconsistently and apathetic.<br>
<br>
I could dig out screenshots of GMs telling me that they knew all the bugs and that therefor I didn't die to a bug (anyone remember dying to the quest giver on sister isle in OOT?  The one that attacked you for killing pirates near her, when the quest she gave was to kill pirates?  That was fixed not long ago, but that was months too late for me).<br>
<br>
Or GMs giving warnings, and promising emails to document it, which never were sent (and yes, my email is kept current).<br>
<br>
Or the head GM on the server taking TWO POINT FIVE MONTHS to respond to emails (I emailed weekly, ended up posting the entire set of forwarded emails to the CS forums, and it still took them another two weeks to get Shiften to get around to blowing me off.)<br>
<br>
Or Buggy quests that eat the items, and the lack of response from VCSR (the KML quest in GD, I've done it, SO went to do it and the mob that drops the leggings never spawned in any form, the rest of the quest went fine.  Guide responding said he'd escalate the issue to the server GM, who responded to my email with 'Sorry, never heard about it, won't do anything about it, have a nice day')<br>
<br>
Petitions never answered, or responded to 6 hours later with a 'Hi, friend!  Hope your problem worked out okay!'  Funny thing, if someone is shouting obscenities at the zone, they respond in minutes to the /report &amp; /petition.  (Try it sometime, /petition that someone is emoting sexual acts, or shouting same at the zone.  Less than 5 minutes later, you will get a response.  /petition about losing your body when a zombie climbs onto the boat in Erud's Crossing, and see how many _days it takes them to respond)<br>
<br>
And no, I don't start out rude to CS, that's silly.  There is no point in aggrevating people you are hoping to get assistance from, particularly when they may have no hand in making policy, or no choice in how to respond.<br>
<br>
veRant CS has a reputation of considering 'customer = liar', 'customer = thief', 'customer = enemy', _for _a _reason.  This wasn't collective 'sour grapes', it was a realization based on _thousands of encounters.  <br>
<br>
Sure, there may well be as many good encounters as bad, but that doesn't excuse veRant CS. <br>
<br>
As things stand, I only bother to contact VCS to get a merchant killed and returned to his bind point, that's the thing they can seem to do with any speed.  And I wholeheartedly agree with the two points brought up in this thread:  Respond to veRant CS as you would hostile airport security, and _never admit anything that can be misconstrued against you.<br>
<br>
Oh, and all the (examples) above are taken from my personal experience, and are just the ones I pulled off the top of my head, I could post a frigging phone sized set of examples, all witnessed first hand, or at most told to me by people I trust who had it happen to them.  The number of times I've actually gotten a useful response to my problem has been .... 3.  6 if you count having a merchant killed, and one of those 3 was a response that made me happy and would have gotten the guide fired if I were stupid enough to post the details where veRant could read them.  Been playing since May of '99, the game has a lot going for it, its just the people behind it that are the problem.<br>

Volunteer Guides. That means they don't get paid. So when it takes hours to get a response, it's entirely possible it's because no Guides are on, or the one who is on is simply swamped. Sure, there's many Guides and I'm sure if Verant scheduled them they could have at least 1 Guide online at all times, 2 or 3 during prime time. But would you follow a schedule someone else set for you, if they weren't paying you?<br>
<br>
Ok, if you want to get technical, they do get paid. They get one (that's one, no more) play account free. So they get $9.95 a month. But if I were a Guide, and Verant tried to tell me when I HAVE to be on, I'd tell them to shove it. Ten bucks a month ain't worth them dictating my personal life.<br>
<br>
I agree, not all Guides or GMs are good, but you should keep in mind not all are bad either. And if they're doing it for free, don't expect them to show up the second you petition and kiss your feet. You'd have to pay me at least 12.95 for that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/21/01 5:25:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dealing with VI</span><hr size=1> I'm not paying the guides to do anything.

I have to agree with Scirocco.  We pay verant to play the game.  We expect to get decent CS, does not have to be great but decent.  It goes with the idea of value added service.  In other words something you do to make the custumer happy so they come back and spend more money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udreth1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dreth1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/22/01 6:20:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dealing with VI</span><hr size=1> Well Blackwulf, many of us have had POSITIVE experiences with them time and time again. <br>

Human nature being what it is, many people don't bother to report a postive experience, because a)unhappy people tend to speak out a lot more, and/or, b)people expect the answer or response or assist. And when they get it, it's merely what they expected, so why bother saying/posting anything?<br>
