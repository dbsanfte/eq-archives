This is actually reposted from the Vault Brell board, and is over a year old.  However, With my application to a local rp guild I finally finished this story arc, and now complete I want to get it out to those who may appreciate it.  If comments and response is good and encouraging, I will post the other chapters<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (end ooc)<br>
<br>
The wind breezed through her fur, soothing her as it cooled.  Even though she could now travel by teleportation, the wolf inside seemed to prefer keeping all four paws on the ground.  The time alone gave her time to think, to reflect, and given the events of the recent past, Sylvania needed the time to straighten out her thoughts and feelings.  Her emotions were tearing her apart.<br>
<br>
Of course, she couldn't find herself too lost in thought, or the Kithcor undead would tear her apart, and no matter how much she hurt, she would rather let the emotions do the deed.<br>
<br>
Sylvania sighed as she entered the forest.  She had once loved this land, roaming for hours along the various paths.  Now evil walked the paths she once traveled, and at times she wondered if the trees themselves were possesed.  By instinct she left the path, and after a quick scent check, skirted the the forest.  While not safe, she knew her chances of an unwelcomed encounter were lesser the farther from the forests dark heart as she could be.  As the rain began, her wolf blood took over the navigation, and her mind lost itself in memory.<br>
<br>
The storm whipped the leaves off of the trees in the Lesser Fay.  Lightning struck the tower repeatedly, illuminating momentarily a solitary wolf, braving the elements with a infant wrapped for travel strapped to his back.  Inside the tower, Wolves of every kind surrounded the young mother, as fey guards stood ever watchful.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is my child?&quot; the weary mother asked.  &quot;Please let me hold my baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wolves exchanged nervous glances.  A calm in the storm lent itself to the silence of the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn you all.  Where is my child!&quot;  The tired lass felt fear.  The bond of motherhood is strong, and although these wolves were her only family until now, her child was the only thought on her mind.  Finally, after a period of timelessness, one of the Conclave of Wolves stepped foward and spoke, hesitant, yet firm.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sylvania.  You are weakened from the birth.  Rest, and after we will speak of the child.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Give me my baby now.  I may be weakened, yet my love is strong.&quot;<br>
<br>
The wolf of the mist sighed.  &quot;Sylvania Wolfaykin, you are our childe.  Found in this forest, we have raised you as our own, teaching you the ways of the mother, creating for us an elven champion.  You grew up with us, trusting our judgement, learning the way of the wolf, learning the way of the Fae.  We love and honor you, you have made us proud beyond our hopes, and to see you hurt pains each of us tenfold.  But you will not see your child now, if ever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvania, eyes tearing then flaming, shouted &quot;What right have you to...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The childe was born dark, dark skinned and dark heart.&quot;  The wolf's voice shouted as his eyes betrayed the pain ripping his heart apart.  His voice softened.  &quot;I would like nothing more than to present to you your child.  I would love to welcome him to our society, to train him as we trained you.  But it will not be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark or light, matters not to me.  No one is born with a heart of darkness.  Hate is learned.  Give me my son!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your son is gone Sylvania.  We have sent him to Neriak as an orphan.  Take comfort that we did not kill him.  We love you far too much for that.  Eziakel has sworn to deliver him there safely.  But you must be seperated from him.  Already this situation has caused too much damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;His father will not stand for this.  He will not see our child raised in hate!&quot;<br>
<br>
The elder wolf adverted his gaze.  &quot;Your lover will never see the child.  Or anything else.  His blood covers the walls of the Third Gate, executed as a traitor to the drow.&quot;<br>
<br>
At this Sylvania could no longer hold back the tears.  Her mind raced over thoughts of her love.  The enchanter.  Sent to trick her, to corrupt her, he took the guise of a wolf, and then an elf to win her heart.  At that he had succeeded.  However that he himself may feel love never crossed his mind.  Their love blazed bright and hot throughout Norrath, until one eve after Syl told him she was pregnant.  On that night, her love had revealed his secret, and begged forgiveness.  His black heart had been changed, and love had defeated hate.  But Syl foolishly scorned him, crushing his new found soul.  After reflection, she had sent word to him in Neriak that she had reconsidered, that their love could breath again.<br>
<br>
As if reading her mind, the wolf spoke.  &quot;The drow are rarely in the dark.  Your last letter was intercepted.  Thank Tunare you made no mention of being with child.  Now mourn your loves death, but put it behind you.  You are alive.  For now at least.  Word is D'Vinn has offered ten platinum to the orc who brings him your head.  If only we had allies who would work as cheap.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvania was silent.  The tears had stopped, but her heart still cried.  If only she had accepted his true form at first, perhaps....<br>
<br>
Sylvania's thoughts were broken as she reached the forest border.  Once again the Kithcor had been safely crossed.  She thanked Tunare as she crossed into the Western Commonlands, and the past once again overwhelmed her mind.<br>
<br>
She remembered a few days after the birth.  Her strong will had overcame her senses and she had made the trip to the Nekolous Forest.  Her son she would find.  <br>
<br>
What she found shook her soul.  For not ten feet from the path, impaled upon a stake, was the corpse of Eziakel.  Or what she thought was a corpse, for as she approached the grisley sight, the shadow wolf wearily raised his head and coughed blood.  The maggots already were eating his flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Syl....leave this place...save yourself...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Eziakel.  You were my mentor, my friend.  It kills part of me to see you suffer, yet still, I must know what has become of my son.&quot;  As she spoke Sylvania began the gestures of casting, calling forth the power of the earth to heal her friend.<br>
<br>
The spell seemed to have no effect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Syl...I am already dead.  They have.... cursed me, bound my soul into my broken body...preventing me from my rebirth.  Syl, you son..he has been adopted, adopted by he that...he that did this to me.  Your son has been named, Khamael.  Syl, they kept me there, they read my mind.  They know of you, and of him.  Syl...forget him.  Even if what you say is true..and hate is learned not born, syl his mentor is hate incarnate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvania's tears flowed both for her son and her friend.  &quot;Eziakel.  You have no reason to lie, and I accept this as truth.  My son, my son is dead to me then.  But you, what can I do, I can not see you like this, is there nothing I can do to save you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill me once again Syl.  Burn me and scatter the ashes, so that my soul may live again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish, my friend.&quot;  Her tears ran as rivers down her face as she began to cast the flame.  &quot;Goodbye friend.  If Tunare wish, may we meet again.&quot;<br>
<br>
The spell coursed through Eziakel's battered body, his howl of pain shaking the foundations of her soul.  Almost immediatly the flames consumed him, reducing him to ash.  As she collected the ashes, she thought she heard them speak two words.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you&quot;<br>
<br>
And after scattering the ashes, Syl set out to forget her son, to forget her pain.  Although still distrustful of all save wolves, she directed her rage towards the racial divisions.  She would bring all the races of Norrath into communion, all iton peace, so the pain that burned her would never be felt by another.<br>
<br>
Sylvania was brought back to reality with a jolt.  Around her, in the commons, lay the corpses of many of her beloved bears.  The slaughter was disgusting.  This was not pelt hunting.  The bodies lay where death struck them down, turning the commons into a mass grave site.  A grizzly, engulfed in darkness, staggered towards her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grizlebangreaflae,&quot; calling the bear by name, &quot;who did this to you and our kin?&quot;<br>
<br>
The bears last words will never be forgotten.  As his dying eyes looked upon Sylvania, he spoke quitely.  &quot;Syl...my friend and kin...a master of death has visited his trade upon us.  He claims to kill in your name.  To spread your hate, to be your avatar.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me his name so that your death may be avenged.  His blood will fertilize the trees and his flesh shall feed your young.  Who is this abomination?  This plague, this black death, WHO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Grizlebangreaflae collapsed.  And as he drew in his last breath, he forced out his last words, in a gurgle of blood.<br>
<br>
&quot;His name is Khamael.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
(ooc)  Sorry for the length all.  Hope you like.<br>
<br>
