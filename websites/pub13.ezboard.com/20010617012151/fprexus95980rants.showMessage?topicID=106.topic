This is why I have no hesitation in sending any of your details to verant for them to deal with. I do not trawl the bay searching for you but if someone posts links to your auction on the bay then tough you are fair game. You are lower than all the KSing, training, spammers on Prexus put together.<br>
<br>
If you think that you have 'worked hard' to get your account up to a saleable level I have got news for you EQ is a game not a job. maybe you should try a job so you know the difference.<br>
<br>
What really amazes me is how the same people can support one person because they WERE a respected played and in the same breath condem someone they have never heard of for Ebaying. You are the height of hipocrisy.<br>
<br>
If you have to have the cash to sort out real world issues maybe you should realise that it was your addiction to this game that got you in the @#%$ in the first place, and deal with that.<br>

Not entirely so. Personally, I've come across more clueless people that haven't been ebayed. The majority of ebay'd characters are bought for utility, not for normal play.<br>

NOOOO again totally relevant.  Evolution, as in life, is inheriant by design to occur in EQ.  Evolution in EQ is the burn out of high level characters, and the addition of Low Level &quot;newbies&quot;.  If EVERYONE sold their characters on the Bay then the high level population becomes saturated with players that should really be low level.  Sure this might not impact established high level people. HOWEVER it does impact the guy that bought EQ in May and is now just hitting 50.<br>

that's about as much of a stretch as Zuk's liar commment. <br>
<br>
since we are only talking about Prexus; and since Prexus has only been online for 15 months.  The Maximum you could be out is what... 200 bucks?  <br>
<br>
Real Money has no place in EQ.  I can just see the auctions in your world Yurian.<br>
<br>
Ebay01 auctions WTB FBSS 10k Plat or 200 American Dollars, send a tell.<br>
<br>
I'm torn still regarding this issue.  I understand people like Citron selling their accoutns in order to get back on their feet.  However, I would never be so pathetic as to let my life rocket out of control because of some stupid computer game.  Most Ebayers I feel sorry for.  They get minimal money for the time and effort they have put into their charcters.<br>
<br>
I don't think the reward is worth the time and effort needed to be put forth to attain the reward.<br>
<br>
Some of use still try to make this game a role playng game.  I'm not saying that EQ is anything like Pen and Paper games; however it has it's own roleplaying style.  Powergamers never understand rolepalying, they think it's stupid and a waste of time.  Most people that seem to support EBAY, or at least not take offense to it, are Powergamers.  Not Roleplayers.<br>
<br>
Roleplayers understand why other Roleplayers hate EQ so much.  Powergamers don't understand this at all.  Powergamers seem to think along the lines of &quot;Well there are only a few high level enchanters and clerics, so the less we lose the better!&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't crap on the people that I know are EBAY characters.  I'm also a roleplayer.  This issue however does not need to be black and white.  While I may not hate those who EBAY, it's not like I go out of the way to help them out; like I would say a low level newbie.<br>

<br>
This does not have an effect on the &quot;level playing field&quot;. There is not a line in the sand where in order to attain something you must purchase it on Ebay. Ebay can make the process faster for those who wish to waste the money. Note: I say waste, as that is what I think it is. There is no difference between this and a small group of people who monopolized certain spawns to the extent that allowed this sort of thing to take place in mass quantities. Its like inbreeding, might be fun while it lasts but eventually it comes back to bite you in the ass. Zukhov's statement also assumed that only kids use ebay, which is a poor representation of the people who are more in the demographic for purchasing these items realistically. Ebay has less of an effect on this situation then established twinks intermingling with &quot;newbies&quot;. There is an infinite amount of potential items in this game, someone buying one or fifty on ebay has no effect on this.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Evolution, as in life, is inheriant by design to occur in EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
Aside from tunings and fixes, there has been no evolution in this game whatsoever. If Verant had any desires to facilitate a real economy, items would decay or require replenishment. The passing of older characters has not happened and it is not due to Ebay. Habitually on each server the first groups to establish a foot hold of &quot;power&quot; (there is no real power or power base to be had in the game) exploit all the resources in a self-perpetuating twink cycle until the point where they burn out, in many cases explosively. <br>
<br>
Denying that there desire to earn hard currency while gaming is to deny the entrepreneurial spirit inherent in our race. There will always be people trying to earn a buck no matter how it can be done. In this game, it is quite simplistic.. the kids (in general) have the time to harvest the crops and the adults (in general) have the money. If you were 14 or 15 years old and suddenly had an item you knew you could get $400 for and you are saving for that PoS first car, where do you think the temptation will lay? Additionally, alot of people put a dollar value on their time, yes even in recreational activities. <br>
<br>
People put different values on activities, you cannot sit back and pass your hand in judgement over them if they do not conform to your take. If Zukhov wants to sit there and play rat on everyone he finds out is Ebay'ing, fine.. I find it laughable, but what ever floats his boat. You can go back and re-read the news messages since about January or so and what you will find is an ever increasing amount of statements from VI stating they will not intervene in a bad Ebay trade. They finally got so hassled with this situation they just decided to &quot;ban&quot; the activity from the game to completely remove themselves. It would be akin to a drug dealer going to the cops after he got his buy money got stolen. They simply dont care, in line with their first comments about Ebay when it first became an issue quickly after the game was launched. <br>

<br>
I still don't understand why people say that Verant only don't like Ebay because of the fraud involved. I think that was only part of the reason. You only have to read whineplay to understand that.<br>
<br>
People do feel betrayed when someone Ebays a well equiped character. They did not 'earn' that stuff on their own. It takes a lot of people. Most of those people who helped probably got actual pleasure from someone being rewarded with a nice item. Then feel gutted when it turns up on he bay. You don't see many olympic medalists selling off their medals after a few months, maybe an extreme example but the principal is there.<br>
<br>
And for every 10 people who buy an ebay account and play it well with respect for others there are 2 or 3 morons that think its a licence to be an @#%$.<br>
<br>
You encourage others by example, i.e 'such and such has sold his or her account so therefore its OK for me to as well. <br>
<br>
If you loose control of your life to such an extent that you need the really rather small amount of cash you get from ebay then your a pretty sad man.<br>
<br>
If you put time and effort into leveling up your character and then someone picks one off the bay for a few quid then it does cheapen the experiance. Instead of having something that you feel is unique and you can take pride in you have something that anyone can purchase.<br>
<br>
As for saying'its my account I can do what I like with it' you specifically agree not to sell when you play the game, so you do not have the right to sell as you waiver this in order to participate.<br>

That's like a drug addict saying they have to sell their stash to get back up on their feet again.  First off, if caught by the authorities (Verant in this case) they will be shown no mercy due to their extenuating circumstances or attempt to fix their lives.  Second, the commodity is illegal.  If it's not causing problems in the originators hands it'll bring trouble to the inheretor (if Verant catches it after the account has been transfered they may decide to terminate, and the inheritor loses their money).  Not to mention the fact that the purchaser may have a reputation attached to that character which could prove *very* negative.  *coughSMOOKEYcough*.  BTW I met the latest incarnation of Smookey, seemed like an ok fellow even though he was still getting used to the game I think.  Nice of course, as opposed to his previous 30 incarnations who were all a waste of water, much less other biological materal.<br>
<br>
Also if these individuals are so worried about money then why on earth aren't they out doing something to improve their income if they aren't happy with it?  I work my ASS off so I can get a bigger paycheck and feel more secure financially, I don't go on planes raids and rub my hands greedily every time a piece of Valorium drops.  I don't worry if my character is only worth 2c when i quit.  So be it.  I got what the game was designed to provide, fun and entertainment out of it.  <br>
<br>
On point four.  You are seriously trying to tell me that you do not understand how prolonging the life of a higher level character and keeping them active and in the game longer does not cause population problems?  Right now America's population is growing quite a bit.  And it's not because people are having more kids, in fact they are having fewer and fewer.  The real problems come from the fact that our population is aging.  <br>
<br>
Technology is prolonging the life of people more and more, and thus as more people are born fewere are dying.  With ebay and EQ the same thing is happening.  Characters with higher levels are having a much longer lifespan than anticipated and are staying active in raids and other high level activities past a &quot;normal&quot; lifespan.  When one player quits the game and leaves that makes room for another to rise up the ranks.  However instead of leaving gracefully people decide to ebay and refuse to make way for those just coming of age, and refuse them space.  Come on Yurian I know you have a logical, thinking, scientific mind.  How could you have stated that...<br>
<br>
Another thing you have to consider Yurian is that Prexus still has relatively little problems with overcrowding of the higher level characters.  How do you think EBay would effect certain other servers who have guilds dedicated to harvesting items and splitting the profit?  Do you think that if you're one of several hundred high level...  Oh...  Warriors...  And you will have to wait months and months to get a single chance at a Trakannon raid, your chances of ever getting a Cobalt bp are good?  If you site overcrowding as being the problem there then how do you justify extending the life of higher level characters even further through ebay?  It's a catch 22. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/umaddiefaye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maddie Faye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/14/00 9:31:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Evolution</span><hr size=1> Evolution in the Game:<br>
<br>
I disagree Yurian.  I think the game has evolved substantially.  Perhaps not in the way you are thinking; however there have been a number of posts in the General forum about &quot;are you old school&quot; and &quot;remember when&quot; type comments.  I think I've seen you post on the threads.  <br>
<br>
Players are becomming more powerful at lower levels twink or otherwise.  This shows evolutioin in a game.  Bronze armor for the 30s is a thing of the past, for the most part.  Kunark has made Lower Guk drops not as hot as they used to be.  Many items have fluxuated in price over time.  (Serp Bracer and Black Pearls would be a fine example)<br>
<br>
Along with this type of evolution; should also come death.  Death in EQ is an endless loop until that character is no longer played.  Then he or she is truly dead.  As pointed out by Skyfire, without death you have overpopulation problems.<br>

One thing I will say, I thought a couple of things about Smookey. One was that he was sort of incredibly arrogant - and nice, it was sort of fun, like a roleplaying wizard thing. Another is that for nothing but to be nice, he gave a RL friend of mine who had started playing, he have her abotu 100pp of items to get her started in jewelcrafting - just nice of him. So whatever else he did I saw some nice things.<br>
<br>
I guess I'd just rather see the real insults saved for the people I saw do things like basically training and getting low levels killed and cussing out everyone who says anything and such. <p>Level 56 Conjurer, collector of robes<BR>

Smookey #1, or maybe it was 2, or 3, hell, i'm not sure...  I'll call him Smookey 1 because i'm unsure of what the number of the owner was...  <br>
<br>
Anyways Smookey 1 begged for a healer, any healer in live tower.  He was there with a chanter, a monk, and me.  We got in, camped for a while.  He was 50 and basically farming the place with a bit of help.  We stay for 30 min, the enchanter dies...  Ok, that's lame.  Smookey says f*** this, later gang, and invisis himself and leaves the other 3 of us to die, because without clarity he can't clear all the spawns and get the phat l3wt (HIS words, not mine).  Didn't bother to invis the rest of us.  Monk feels bad and tries to help me to the zone, I make a wrong turn, end up getting closer to king than the zone.  Monk feels real bad for me now but has to log so he can't help me with cr.  I get my 21st level necro (who died about 10 times but I don't really care that much, never play him :P) to pull my corpse.<br>
<br>
Next Smookey incarnation I met was a ksing evil bastard who jumped 2 spawns a group of mine was camping in the lower tower.  I was soooo tempted to use fear to break his roots and get him (and probably myself as well) killed.  I didn't though and when we left he claimed the whole tower for himself and ksed everyone he could who tried to move in on 'his' spawns.<br>
<br>
The last Smookey I met was in freeport.  I was fighting a guard and lagging out, and just about to die.  Thankfully he blasted it to pieces.  It was blue and I didn't get the exp but I didn't really care, I was just happy I wasn't going to need a res <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .

We ended up not buying it but I will post the reasons that even got us to the point of thinking about buying it. Maybe it will offer a view different from the &quot;kid with rich daddy&quot;-thing...<br>
<br>
I have been playing since August 1999. Part of the reason I am only level 46 (besides loving to hunt in Mistmoore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is my limited play time due to real life reasons. Most of my friends in-game are in rather small guilds and we rarely are able to field what would be considered a balanced group. On top of that we mostly play off-peak hours - which is fine, most of the time, but does pose additional difficulties when trying to form a pick-up group.<br>
<br>
To me Everquest is still a game. A game that is usually no fun if there is no risk involved, which means I die quite a bit. Due to the reasons mentioned above I don't have a lot of resurrections to my name. It sure would be nice to have a Cleric at my disposal at all times...<br>
<br>
So here is what we would have done with said character (which was a Cleric):<br>
<br>
1. We would have used it as some sort of insurance that would always have been available for resurrections.<br>
<br>
2. We would have brought him along to go places where it *really* helps if you are able to bring along a Cleric - and there are a lot of those in Kunark. I was imagining taking it easy first, e.g. going to places we were able to do without a Cleric to get the feel for the class a bit. Later we could have started pushing our limits a bit further.<br>
<br>
3. Once we would have felt comfortable with it we might have let him group with other people or even taken him on a raid if an additional Cleric would have been needed. <br>
<br>
<br>
I absolutely do not see how me and my friends buying that character would have hindered other people's enjoyment of the game. None of the reasons stated in this thread seem to apply - either that or I simply fail to see them.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so why did we not buy the character? There are various reasons, the biggest probably being that there are signs of my and some of my friends' EQ-&quot;career&quot; drawing to an end. This might happen in a month, maybe not until next year, but the end will come and we know it. <br>
<br>
Another major reason was the limited play time I have mentioned before. What good would a Cleric do me if I would subsequently have to split the time between two main characters? I would not get anywhere at all with either of them. <br>
<br>
Obviously money was a concern, although living in a place where my EQ-related phone bill regularly runs to $200 a month it was not as big as some might think. EQ is an expensive hobby where I live and a couple hundred bucks would not have made that much of a difference.<br>
<br>
Lastly the view expressed on this board were an issue as well. It would not have influenced us enough not to buy if it had not been for the other reasons. But admittedly it was a factor in the decision making process.<br>
<br>
<br>
I did not hope to sway any oppinions with this post. All I tried to achieve is that maybe, like with other things, it is too easy to condemn Ebay to be &quot;evil&quot;. There are two sides to every coin and Ebay is no exception.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/umaddiefaye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maddie Faye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/20/00 2:28:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hmm</span><hr size=1> I am going to change my tune a bit in relation ot this thread.

ran into Polli the other day... who's name is now <br>
Polli Da'Origonal.  hmmmm should be Polli da EBayed.<br>
<br>
I checked out this auction on EBAY one day... one person, had about 50 different auctions on 4 different servers going on.... that is annoying.<br>
<br>
People who sell their accounts, then run around saying it's me it's me I'm really back.. well they annoy me.  I'm not sure why.. I just find them annoying.  Mostly perhaps because I know one day they will leave the game again and then EBAY all over again.<br>
<br>
Few people have the time to dedicate to bringing up a character to post 50.  It's annoying that people who EBAYED and left, now come back and raise another high level character to 50+ to only sell again.<br>
<br>
Yurian, do you see now how that makes the high level players on the server top heavy?  These are only two examples of people that I know.  How many other people out there powergame themesleves to 50+.. sell the account.. and start all over again.. thus creating a top heavy high level population.<br>
<br>
Annoying?  Very.<br>
<br>
Evil? hmm no... not evil.<br>
<br>
immorale?  I think that is a stretch.<br>
<br>
I find people that EBAY annoying.  Buyers or sellers.  They successfully drive the final nail in roleplaying's coffin in EQ.  There is no roleplaying where there are characters purchased for IRL money.  There is no way that you can roleplay that without it just sounding funny.<br>
<br>
I don't hate people that EBAY.  I don't hate people that buy accounts on EBAY. <br>
<br>
I find you annoying.<br>

PS: Armathien.  If you would have bought that cleric you would have not had a reason to interact with another cleric in the game.  PArt of this game goes beyond pressing buttons; it goes into establishing relationships.  You would not have the need to establish outside relationships with other clerics if you had one at your disposal.<br>
<br>
EBAY doesn't hurt anyone directly. Indirectly in compromises the integriy of the game.  Just like bugs and other exploits. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/umaddiefaye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maddie Faye</A> at: 9/20/00 2:31:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uquezplectic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quezplectic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/20/00 3:52:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Verant</span><hr size=1> Why doesn't Verant do anything about eBayers?<br>

<br>
Personally, I consider ebay to be akin to paying a major league baseball player to play on your kid's little league team. Stacking the cards in your favor because you can afford to. While EQ isn't quite as directly competitive, other games and other analogies can be drawn. Either way, as far as I'm concerned, no &quot;game&quot; (outside of gambling games) should at all be influenced by how much money you have in your bank account. If you can't play the game normally then bugger off and find another game you can play. Buying your way to the top pisses me off, no matter how you try to justify it, because getting level 50 or 60 and all sorts of nice items should be a symbol of how dedicated you are to this game, not how much of a rich snot you are that you can afford to pay some schmuck a shitload of money on ebay or whatever other website is the flavor of the month. <p><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Fdor><img src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></href></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/4/01 2:17:55 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/craig234/eq/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Verant</span><hr size=1> One of those unusual opportunites I get to say /agree ididar.<br>

I was in Paw one day with my second when low and behold an Ebayed character I knew zoned in and headed to the back to go after that summon corpse spell. He was there to pharm for Ebay and I pretty much knew it. This was before Kunark and he was level 50. Suddenly the group hears all kind of racket from the back of the dungeon and I do a / and he isn't in the zone. He was in HH, LOL. Massive greenie death. So this moron comes back and dies again getting his corpse.<br>
<br>
Later that month I did a /w XXXXXX and he is level 48. LOL he was a topped out on exp character when he was sold. This guy had the idea of buying a level 50 character and using it to pharm stuff to sell on Ebay. Later he was never heard from again. The word was, &quot;banned for excessive Ebay activity.&quot; LOL Kind of backfired on him to say the least.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showMessageRange?topicID=106.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showMessageRange?topicID=106.topic&start=41&stop=45>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showMessage?topicID=341.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showMessage?topicID=64.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.emailToFriend?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.threadControl?topicID=106.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=106.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=106.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980grouping">Grouping<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants>Rants and Flames</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.free-irewards.com/cgi-bin/ezboard/games.html?id=ouuIcESe" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/banners/iRewards120x30-08.gif"></a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=7279965&siteid=33932331&bfpage=expertc_tax" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
