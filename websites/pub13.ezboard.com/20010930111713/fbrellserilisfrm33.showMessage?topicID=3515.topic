All through high school I worked at a pizza joint as a pizza and sandwich construction engineer.  After my first year of college I went back to the pizza place where I started as a pizza and sandwich delivering and scheduling agent.  These are all based on real life experiences.  <br>
<br>
1.  We, at the pizza joint, will make fun of you if you ask for or say something dumb.  Some things we will make fun of you are (note, these ALL happen/have happened -- do not do these):<br>
   -tell us you threw up from our last pizza and demand another<br>
   -use coupons from other pizza places<br>
   -demand a refund for a pizza we didn't give you<br>
   -demand refunds from someone who is not a manager -- they work at a pizza place, they push buttons<br>
   -ask if we deliver to a city 35+ mins away and get pissed when we say no<br>
   -ask if we deliver to your city when there is another store of the same company IN your city<br>
<br>
2.  Ordering.  A good rule of thumb here is to tell us your REAL address in your REAL city.  The computers are very smart, they can tell if you are lieing.  We will NOT deliver to you if you are NOT in the delivery area.  Simple as that.  Its pretty black and white, no grey area.  Don't try to bargain with a 16 year old who works at a pizza place, they push buttons.<br>
<br>
3.  Delivery en route.  A REALLY good idea here is to have the address ON your house or mailbox.  Another idea, if it is dark, is to have a light on, both on your house and where your address is located.  You don't know how much it helps when we can SEE your address.<br>
<br>
4.  Recieving your pizza.  A good idea for this one is answer the door.  Having your doorbell working is a good thing too.  Have your money ready when recieving your pizza ESPECIALLY when its raining.  In this case make haste.  Delaying answering the door because you think its funny to watch me get soaked is not funny.  Stop laughing.  <br>
<br>
5.  Oh yeah, and uhh... tip your pizza guy.  Thankyou is good too.  Both are really good.  Neither is bad.  Stiffing and then being a smartass is really bad.<br>
<br>
I thank you all for reading my guide and I hope none of you had to learn anything new.  If you did, I suggest you pick up on my sarcasm and rearrange your pizza ordering ways. <p>Clubbin Dusktyme <Alat-Seldi><BR>

<br>
A: I have been a cook most of my life.  I would NEVER do anything to anyones food, even if they had insulted my mother.  I would rather go out and punch someone in the face than @#%$ with thier food.  That is truly sick...  Some people take cooking seriously.  I consider it an art form and I really enjoy it when someone likes the food I create.<br>
<br>
B: Tip your delivery drivers.  I am serious.  or don't order from the same place twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I drove and managed a  pizza place.  They remember your address.  They remember your phone number.  And they certainly remember whether or not you tipped.  This goes two ways.  either you get your pizza the last run of the trip, or you get it first.  Besides, it help to circulate the drug money.<br>

ps: actually, I usually don't take it bad when someone insults my mother.  She can whup some ass.<br>

Actually, the computers are not very smart.  Papa Johns is a block away from my house.  I live in Milwaukie, OR.  I called them, ordered a pizza and they argued with me because their computer said I lived in Oak Grove, OR.  OK,  Oak Grove isn't really a city anyhow, and I was like &quot;dude, If I wasn't so lazy I'd walk down and pick up my pizza...just drive up the street to the first apartment complex on the left.&quot;  He insisted I lived in Oak Grove, so I told him that he could put whatever he wanted into the computer, just so long as I got my pizza.<br>
<br>
On a side note:  I ALWAYS tip the pizza guy $5.  They used to fight over my house because it was so close and I tip. My pizza was always hot, always fast, and the people were always very nice to me.  TIP, TIP, TIP!<br>

<br>
Be scrupulously polite to anyone who's handling your food where you can't see it.<br>
<br>
If you have to complain about anything beyond &quot;This is bleu cheese. I orered ranch. Could I please get another salad with ranch?&quot; asked with a smile, then accept no further food. Your meal is done. If you have to say &quot;Your service stinks&quot; or anything like that, you're done. <br>
<br>
If the waitresses screw up majorly and know it, be gracious about it. Not only will they bend over backwards to make it right, but your meal's likely to be free if you handle it with grace. <br>
<br>
Once a waitress dropped a ketchup bottle which splattered on my khaki pants. This was in Fargo, ND, and it was my last meal before leaving the hotel to return home to St. Paul, MN. It was my last pair of clean pants. <br>
<br>
Lots of club soda later I smelled only faintly like tomato and vinegar, and walked out of the restaurant, my wife, kids and I having had a good meal without paying a dime.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usindarreofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sindarre of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Hero of Brell Serilis<br><font color=#A0B0E0>&lt;Silent Redemption&gt; </font></span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/24/01 12:12:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clubbin's Guide to Ordering a Pizza</span><hr size=1> Have done the bartender thing.  Tipping is good.  I am always polite and always tip 20%.  If you really really suck.. but are nice.. I will still tip 20%.  If you are rude and do a great job or if you rude and do a sucky job.  You get nothing.  I don't like rude people.<br>
<br>
There is a local restraunt in town here.  I know the bartenders by name.  They know me by name.  I always get my drinks and chips fast and with a smile.  They already know what I want to eat so they just ask if I'm hungry.  They always get 20%.  More on Holidays.<br>
<br>
Be good to the people in the service industry.  Watch the beginning of reservoir dogs if you don't get it.  People who don't have the courtesy to tip immediatly bump a few notches lower on my opinion scale.  People who are deliberatly rude in their tipping habits &quot;That XXXX doesn't deserve a dime!!!&quot; usually drop to the bottom of my opinion scale.  <br>
<br>
On pizza.  All of the above is good.  The harder it is for pizza people to get to you.  Or the incentive for them to not really try to get your pizza to you.  The colder it is when you get it.<br>

There was a restaurant I used to go to right next to the movie theater, so I was there at least once a week.  Then one night I was there and I was waiting and waiting for my food, and it'd been over an hour since I'd ordered, no salad, no bread, and I had to leave to see the movie, so I just asked for the check so I could pay for my drinks and go.  No complaints, just a request for the check, but I had to ask the host, because the waitress was nowhere to be found.  Instead of bringing my check, he brought the manager, who also didn't bring my check.  Then the manager asked us to hold on, and came back AGAIN without the check, and basically accused us of lying, that the waitress said it hadn't been anywhere near an hour (since I was on a schedule for the movie and I'm anal like that, I knew EXACTLY how long it had been since she'd taken our order), so he leaves, comes back again with the check, and says &quot;Oh, you just had sodas, I suppose we can take care of that.&quot;  And I was late for my movie and haven't been to that restaurant since. <p><center><img src="http://ravenous.disassociative.net/fae53.jpg"><center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uclubbindusktyme.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Clubbin Dusktyme</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/24/01 12:56:03 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ballericons.com/icon/93.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clubbin's Guide to Ordering a Pizza</span><hr size=1> To clarify:<br>

Now when it comes to bars i don't understand why people will walk to the bar and stand in line for 10-15 min (on Sat's it gets like that) and tip the bartender, but when they are lazu and they want ME to go and get their drinks in half the time they won't tip me. We will sell Long Island Ice Teas for $2.75 and there are people that will argue about getting their quarter back (i've started picking up the 3 bucks, smiling, saying thank you and walking away). I will say thank you no matter what. <br>
<br>
HOWEVER on a Sat night it gets different, i'm too busy to smile, i have people STANDING asking me to get them drinks (to which i reply - you'll be standing right here when i get back ? If they say no i ask them to ask me again when they are done dancing), i'll have a tray that's WAY too full of glasses and be at a table taking orders so 3 other people feel the need to give me their orders as well, then none of them tip............. i just don't understand why you'll walk to the bar and stand there, but when I have to you don't want to tip me. <p>  Ariannda Kusanagi<br>

<br>
I have ordered Papa Johns 30 times since mvoing here (April 2001) and I've gotten 30 different delivery folks.  My pizza is always $11.30 and I give em $15 and say keep it.  But the tip only serves to make me feel good.  It does no good in regards to the service I receive IMO. <p><TABLE border="1" width="400" BORDERCOLOR="gray">

Come on, do unto others, etc.<br>
<br>
As a side note, Arbys has mega fallen from grace and they do suck quite badly now.  When I worked there, Arby's was # 3 with only McDonalds and Burger King above them.  I never go there now because they charge as much as portillos (very high quality fast food place in Chicago) and the food is not even close in quality.  If I have to request hot fries every time I go there, that should indicate to them there is a problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugarrdor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garrdor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/24/01 3:20:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clubbin's Guide to Ordering a Pizza</span><hr size=1> Arclan is on a first name basis with the pizza guy, hahaha.<br>

Tips in UK go to: taxi drivers (ie: cabbies, not psychos with mohawks: David Beckham's rich enough as it is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and waiters/waitresses get tips. Bar tenders generally don't. Tipping isn't traditionally as big in UK, but in the last 10-15 years it's becoming more widespread and more 'the norm'. It's not that we're tight-fisted, it's just a cultural thing.<br>
<br>
What amuses me: I earn a reasonable salary as a 30-year old professional. I work in Construction in basically an Architect's role: I'm a consultant, and the builders are a different firm employed directly by the Client. We finished a fairly small project in an off-license (liquor store) just before Christmas. Client was happy with everyone's work: mine, the site staff, the construction firm boss, etc. Job finished on time below budget, to high standard of design and workmanship. The Client gave the workmen a bottle of whisky each, and to the boss of the construction firm himself: very generous. I got a thank you, a smile and a hand-shake (and a 'Merry Christmas'), but I didn't get a bottle of Diet Coke, let alone whisky. Fair enough, you say. Yet the site workers earn at least 25% more take-home than I did at the time...<br>

I know here, the norm is for waitresses to actually earn, per hour, slightly less than minimum wage. They're expected to exceed minimum with tips. Some restaurants pay a little better, some a little worse. <br>
<br>
In my previous job, I helped pull together a couple of business plans for different restaurants that were trying to get opened. In each one, the bartenders were paid good money, plus tips. The waitresses... less than minimum and tips. Nothing against bartenders, but still.<br>
<br>
My father is an incredible tipper. He tips pretty much everyone. The paperboy, the guy who wipes down the car after it gets out of the carwash, the attendant at a full serve gas station... etc. I'm not nearly as good as he is (I forget for ones other than waitresses and waiters and delivery folk all the time).  <p><center><a href="http://ang.mux.net"> <img src="http://ang.mux.net/newishsig.jpg" border=0></a><br><img src="http://ang.mux.net/highbs.jpg" border=0> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxetan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xetan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grumpy Young Man</span><br>  Posts: 793<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/25/01 5:46:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Clubbin's Guide to Ordering a Pizza</span><hr size=1> OK now that we are talking about tips I have a question for everyone.
