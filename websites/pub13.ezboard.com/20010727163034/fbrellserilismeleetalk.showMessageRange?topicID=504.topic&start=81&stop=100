<br>
Part of your problem with the paladin class is you are being shortsighted about some of the equipment.  The boots and the arms are pretty useless.  The helm is awesome.  It reduces downtime faster than healing with mana and medding.  Only level 60 priests and level 39+ clerics heal better.  Don't hero yourself.  Use the daring helm instead.  So, you lose about 300 or so HP from not having the top of the line hero spell.  You make a tradeoff for having mana efficiency.  Same goes for the gloves.  What spell do you pull with?  Why not pull with the cancel magic gloves?  They save you mana, and a spell slot.  And as for the bracer...you couldn't be more wrong.  Go scroll up and read what I wrote about how good the bracer is, especially for your weapon selection.<br>
<br>
As for stats, stats don't matter as much as AC.  Keep your stamina over 100, your agility over 75, and don't be encumbered by your own gear, and you are fine.  Paladins are defensive tanks.  Make your AC appropriate to your level with better gear.  Go to icewell and get the boots, gloves, and helm with about 30 minutes work.  Get 1 DW bracer to have options for your role in combat.  Get some guardian armor for resists and AC and some stats.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The ac would be nice.. but I really need to keep my stats up. Not to mention the vast mana loss I would take.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Paladins don't rely on their mana except for backup heals and stuns and stuff.  If you are worried that you don't have enough mana, then IMO you aren't grouping with the right people.  Healers heal.  Paladins tank with option of backup heal. <p>=============================

I'm most of the time medding up to keep my mana high. That puts the gloves in the useless catagory.<br>
<br>
The bracer takes 6 seconds to cast it's 3 second stun. During that 6 seconds, I could have already swung once, or twice if hasted. I could also use the tiny bit of mana (30) to cast the stun spell instead, and it only takes 1.5 seconds to cast. My mana bar doesn't even move when casting it, and if I have c2 on, I gain back the mana before it even recycles. That puts the bracer in the useless catagory.<br>
The helmet CAN heal, but the daring buff takes a LONG time to cast, and only heals 120ish hp. That takes forever if you are trying to fill up even one bub of a warrior. I've used the damn thing, and it's junk. You have to have a daring line of buff or less to be able to use it, and barely anyone wants to take some crappy daring buff over hero or Natureskin. That puts the helmet in the useless catagory.<br>
<br>
Deepwater armor is crap. the ac is great, but the effects are ludicrously stupid. I'm not being shortsighted about this, I've tested ALOT of different tactics, and so far, the way I'm set up now is I have 175wis with a 149str and a 98sta. My big supply of mojo keeps me and the group going for a long time without having to break. I have enough mana to where if the healer(s) need a few minutes to med break, I can take over as primary healer. yes, I've done it before in places like disco and guardian, and never had any problems. When the healers are good on mana, I go towards stunning and nuking. I keep my 3 stuns loaded, as well as my Flame of Light. I time my casts with my swings, and I do well.<br>
<br>
The only area I'm suffering in is AC. I am having a hard time finding decent equipment to replace Valorium that has better ac. To the guy who posted about bracers, yes. Most bracers have the same ac as thier plane bracer. Lambent and Imbued have 10ac. Ro and Valorium have 10ac. etc etc. But the other armor slots are lower than planer armor.<br>
I dont want to kill the dwarves in Icewell because there are good quests there, and it's nice having a city where I can rest at in Velious.<br>
<br>
My only other options are to kill the giants in Kael and get thier armor, but it's so rare that I get to go on a raid there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucharlam00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Charlam00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 763<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/28/01 3:02:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> Kill the dwarves, Icewell Keep, the boots and gloves are quite nice, Bind in front of Thurgadin and you should ahave NO problems, same with front of Kael and/or Skyshrine.

Oh, factor on the DW bracer, recast is INSTANT, meaning you can activate it while waiting for your mana based stuns to cycle, it may reduce your overall damage, but stun's a good taunt, and if that mob ain't hittin' it's letting your damage dealers do THEIR job more efficiently.<br>
<br>
The kunark armor in general has one thing over your planar set, and that is AC, but when your job is to get hit, HP and AC is all that really counts neh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Some mobs can use a cancel magic every fight.  Necromancers with the dshields come to mind.  If you don't have a slower in group, dispelling the hastes from the shaman is useful.  If you don't have a snarer dispelling the sow from a frog is useful.  If you can't find a use for free dispells, then something is seriously wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;The bracer takes 6 seconds to cast it's 3 second stun.&quot;<br>
That's a 50% slow.  Togors insects is 60%.  Togor's insects doesn't keep casters from casting.  Togor's insects doesn't stop runners from running away.<br>
<br>
&quot;During that 6 seconds, I could have already swung once, or twice if hasted.&quot;<br>
You aren't an offensive tank.  You are a defensive tank.  Learn your role in the group.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could also use the tiny bit of mana (30) to cast the stun spell instead, and it only takes 1.5 seconds to cast.&quot;<br>
And it has a recast delay of about 10 seconds, making it useless to chain cast.  If you want to chain cast stuns, you need to cycle through your 3 stuns, which ends up costing you 30 mana plus 60 mana, plus about 100 mana.  That's a hell of a lot of mana to do what you can do for free with a bracer.<br>
<br>
Something else that also works is to bracer, then stun with a spell, then bracer, then stun with a spell.  You end up keeping the mob stunned for about 5 seconds at a time, while only marginally reducing your attack rate.  You don't see shaman complaining that they don't get to melee enough while they do the slowing for a group.<br>
<br>
&quot;My mana bar doesn't even move when casting it, and if I have c2 on, I gain back the mana before it even recycles.&quot;<br>
And what do you do when you don't have c2?<br>
<br>
&quot;That puts the bracer in the useless catagory.&quot;<br>
That puts you in the shortsighted category.  The bracer is PROVEN to be useful in combat for slowing and taunting and keeping casters from casting a thing in combat.  If you can't see that, it's no wonder you can't get into groups.<br>
<br>
&quot;The helmet CAN heal, but the daring buff takes a LONG time to cast, and only heals 120ish hp. That takes forever if you are trying to fill up even one bub of a warrior.&quot;<br>
It takes longer to use greater or superior heals and meditate the mana back.  The daring helm with its long cast time is faster healing than any level 59 or lower shaman or druid can do.  It's a fact.  3 darings and you've healed over 300hp.  You can't get back the mana to cast gheal in 30 seconds of sitting and meditating.  It takes longer.  It's a matter of mana efficiency.  The helm is more efficient than using mana to heal.  When I have a paladin in the group with the helm, I INSIST that they don't give me anything but free daring buffs.  It heals faster than anything but a cleric healing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've used the damn thing, and it's junk.&quot;<br>
Shortsighted.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have to have a daring line of buff or less to be able to use it, and barely anyone wants to take some crappy daring buff over hero or Natureskin.&quot;<br>
Education.  Lots of people think that if your yellow bar empties in combat you become less effective.  Lots of people thought that dex makes you hit more often.  Fallacies.  If you don't have a cleric in party for cheals, then max HP doesn't matter nearly as much.  If a 5-10% bonus in your max health is the difference between life and death wherever you are hunting, then you are taking on a place much too tough.  Use daring, and the daring helm, and be a better addition to your group than you would otherwise.<br>
<br>
To tell the truth, every time I see your lack of DW armor while your at the zone in Seb makes me think your equipment is less than appropriate.  I've partied with paladins that use DW armor, and the armor and spell effects add a lot to the group.  I've played a paladin with DW, and I KNOW how good the spell effects are.  If I had to pick you, with your total lack of DW armor, and a low 50s paladin with a few pieces of DW armor, I'd take the lower level one, because he actually knows what he's doing concerning his armor.<br>
<br>
Paladins are defensive tanks with backup heals and utility spells.  Paladins should have high AC, high resists, and use their spells to reduce damage and downtime taken by their group.  They control the aggro much better than warriors, allowing for other damage dealing classes to do their thing (keeping monks and rogues and casters from being attacked).  This is what good paladins do.   <p>=============================

Juujuu, you don't realize that even without c2 or even clarity, I have enough mana to maintain the chain stunning. I'm not shortsighted like you say I am, I have done my research, I know what I'm talking about. Quit downsizing my intelligence and debate this like a normal person would. You say one thing, I'm defending the other side. I say that the DW bracer is useless. If you are trying to maintain aggro, then it is stupid, just plain idiotic, to try to cast a spell that takes 6 seconds to cast. A mob can get in 3 swings on you, and most likely is going to hit you. <br>
<br>
I can easily get my ac over 1100, without clerical buffs. <br>
I've already debated the bracer, and have proven if you have the mana, DW is a worthless item to get, unless you don't care about stats and love the ac.<br>
<br>
And as far as a level 50 paladin knowing more about his armor than I have, I got to kind of smile. And if you want to choose a level 50 paladin because he uses DW armor over someone like me, who already has more ac than a paladin in DW anyway (thanks to Nature's Defender), well, your call. but you are going to have one lousy tank in high intense areas, and I gauruntee I'll perform better in ANY situation than a low 50's paladin with a few pieces of that precious deepwater armor.<br>
<br>
I've done my testing with the helmet. You want facts, then here we go.<br>
Superior healing takes 250mana (half a bub from me) and heals 600hp. The DW helm heals 120hp and takes no mana, but casts 6 seconds longer (the Daring taking 10sec to cast, Sup heal taking 4.5).<br>
Greater Healing only takes 150 mana but heals at only 300hp.<br>
<br>
Sup heal is mana efficient over Gheal. Now here is the kicker.<br>
<br>
With clarity2 on, I will med up the lost mana faster than it would take me to stand there and cast five darings (each daring 120hp.. 5 x 120 = 600, or one sup heal). That's 50 seconds to med. 50 seconds is a long time to be sitting, and I easily gain a half bub, EASILY, when I'm medding. Hell, even with normal clarity, I can get a little under a half bub in 50 seconds.<br>
<br>
Well, shaman, this paladin knows her @#%$, has done her testing, and have given the ball to you now.<br>
<br>
I've proven how ineffective DW is. The legs and gauntlets being the most useful perhaps, but everything else is second rate to Valorium. You lose valuable stats and resists when you de-equip your valorium in favor of DW. I've shown you my ac, and I have more ac than many warriors (it just so happens the ranger I was comparing myself to was some stupid uber ranger with ac out the ass). <br>
<br>
Maybe if you were to get some nice valorium pieces on your alt paladin, you would see the difference it makes.<br>
<br>
Almost none. Except higher stats. I only notice big melee changes when you hit the next centigrade ( 900, 1000, 1100, etc). With Valorium, I can keep well over 2000 mana, good stats (for a high elf anyway), and very good ac AND still maintain a good offensive edge.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You still want those half DW covered paladin newbs in your groups?<br>
<br>
<br>
fine, I'll take a real shaman who knows how to utilize other classes in more ways than one. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A> at: 5/30/01 6:49:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utanluas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanluas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://gucomics.everlore.com/strips/gu_07162000.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/29/01 7:33:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> no,no,no Fenye.

Her arguments are solid and accurtae, and her equipment choice is excellent.<br>
<br>
Fenye, one change, perhaps a Golem Tear ring (AC 2 Str 2 Wis 6 Mana 10) from Chardok would make a good replacement for your Velium Wis ring?<br>
<br>
Also why do you prefer your neck item to an old world PMT?  Just curious.<br>
<br>
And for general knowledge, there are in my opinion two ways of playing a paladin: a way that ephasizes the Cleric nature and a way that emphasaizes the Warrior elements.  Both are effective, and both have their uses.  HE Paladins can, generally, emphasize the cleric nature of their class more effectively as they have more mojo to use their spells.  Conversely the Dwarven Paladin as a general rule of thumb can more effectively emphasize the Warrior element due to the natural stat bonus in Str and Sta.  Though these things can even out over time, typically players grow into thise rolls over time and have a difficult time adjusting post 50.<br>
<br>
If a player can adjust they have a highly adaptable Hybrid with many twists and skills that can be exploited.  It takes creativity and flair to really play a paladin well, as well as a great deal of experience.  Frankly if you have not played a paladin for a long period of time, it is dificult to appreciate the nuiances of the class.  <br>
<br>
One can subtely but effectively manage Hate with Stuns, Flame of Light and the DD line of Undead spells.  Though inferior, paladins are OFTEN asked to shoulder the buff burden to take presure of the cleric, and when no cleriuc is available the Ac and Symbol lines of buffs are indespensible.  <br>
<br>
Crowd control with non summoning mobs is Highly effective with root parking, as is pulling when Hich AC and Hp are needed to surve long run outs.  I can control a three mob pull without a mezzer by soloing/root parking 2 mobs easily, keeping them on me and myself alive while the rest of the group concentrates their fire on the primary target.  <br>
<br>
As a back up healer a paladin will save a group from a wipe out.  I have lost track of the times I have dumped all of my mana into heals and saved agroup when the healers are agrod/oom/dead/camped whatever.  I do not cound loh here, simply Gheal which is enough to barely stay ahed of a mobs damage output in many situations.<br>
<br>
And finaly, though rare as hell, paladins have one skill at the end of the game that is clearly highly desireable.  We can rez at 59.  Only a handful of palaidns ever gain this skill.  Most give up before they reach 59.  But what an amazing ability.<br>

And I wasn't going to add my opinion but figured I will anyway.  First off the question are Paladin useless, the answer is No.  And I'll do my best to explain why I think this.<br>
<br>
Now I looked at you equipment and it's all great equipment, but might not be best depending on what you you are going to have to play in the group.  Don't get me wrong it's great stuff and I'd love to walk around carrying that kinda items but heres why I think this way.  A Paladin can preform different tasks and in each group it could, and probally will be, different.  We can tank and heal, and crowd control to a certain extant.<br>
<br>
In a tank heavy group (this includes other pallys/sks/warriors) we need to be healers.  So drop the ac down a bit and get more wis, and a DW helm.  I say this because although we are a tank in this group let someone else take the hits, unless of course your all hybrids and you have more hp/ac then the others in this case let someone else be the main/back up healer.<br>
<br>
In a healer heavy group your expected to tank, drop that wis, you don't need it.  Throw on you ac gear and get hit.  If theres a lot of healers you shouldn't even need to mem your heal spells, although it's a good safty precaution.<br>
<br>
In a caster heavy group (This mean no healer or perhaps a druid/shammy healer), well this is the toughest kinda of group for us to fight in.  Not only are we expected to tank, but heal as well.  And in this type of group I would assume you shine in, cause with your stats I assume you can do both and still make out pretty well.  <br>
<br>
And last but not least the perfect group.  Now there will be a Warrior/Cleric/Chanter in this group.  And in all honesty we preform best in this group as well.  Now in this group, ac is nice but not king like most people think.  To a warrior is ac is always king, but here your spot on the hate list is far more important then anything.  Whenever there is a warrior in the group you arn't main tank and shouldn't be getting hit like you are.  Instead your job is to prevent damage to the warrior all while keeping under him on the hate list.  But controling the hate list is far harder then some think.  While a warrior can only hit the taunt button and use his fastest weapon, we have spells, so use them wisely, don't get above the warrior on the hate list.  Instead stay right under him so if you do feel the need to take a hit for him while the heal is comming all you need to do is hit the taunt button once.  And don't be afraind to turn you attack off, your not here to do large amounts of damage, you here to prevent the damage.  Stand back if needs be, but whatever you do chain stun him while the warrior/wiz/rogue/ranger/mage does damage.  <br>
<br>
Now onto the issue with DW and it's worth.  Now in some groups it's ac is second to none (Well it is to some of the Velious stuff, but really how many people get that) and in certain groups you'll need the ac.  And in some group you'll need the stats of the Valorium.  Now I'll agree with you, some of the DW effects are as lame as can be, but personally I would invest in atleast the DW bracer and helm.  I'm not saying wear them all the time, just be sure to have them if the group you in calls for you to have a role in which they would benefit you. <br>
<br>
3 more things to mention before I shut up.  One, you didn't say whats on your back, I would suggest trying for a Lod shield if you don't already have one.  And second, Why no Range item?  You could easily obtain An Idol of the Thorned (Ac10 Str7 Sta10), better then nothing.<br>
<br>
And lastly, are paladin useless?  No, we all may feel useless at times, but so does every other class out there.<br>
<br>
That's my 2 cents.<br>

<br>
<br>
My back slot item USED to be a hiero cloak, and my ranged item used to be a medicine totem (loved the ac and wis), but I got depressed one night and sold all of Fenye's no drop equipment. So now I use my old Aegis of Life on the back slot, and nothing in the range atm.<br>
<br>
Lod shields are always camped, and I simply cannot find the people willing to camp it with me, and I don't have the patience to kill him multiple times and watch other people win his scale (needed for to turn in for the shield).<br>
<br>
I haven't thought about golem tear rings, and I've just recently started camping howling stones (I've only been there once - hard to find groups there). That would be a nice addition though.<br>
<br>
And you are right about the DW gear. It's a tough call though, because the Valorium helm gives a whopping 13MR, while only 4ac less than the DW helm. I'm still unsure of the tradeoffs. The bracer is 6ac more than Valorium bracers, and I would probably go ahead and try to get a few of them for ac purposes. <br>
<br>
I have other gear I swap out for when I tank, and for when I'm healer (mostly jewelry, but I carry adamantite epaulets for the wis when I go healing).<br>
<br>
but all in all, I really don't see a huge difference in the damage warriors take compared to the damage I take. Our hp bars seem to go down just as fast for the most part, although the warrior does have a higher damage output.. most of the time. hehe. Nature's Defender really packs a wallop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uquierov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QuieroV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 221<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/31/01 10:49:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1>      I just wanted to point something out reguarding the bracer, you said that it's a 6 second cast and that it's a 3 second stun and that slows the mob by 50%.  6 second cast time + 3 second stun time = 9 seconds, with the mob not attacking for 3 seconds of that which would mean that it's really only slowing the mob by 33%.<br>
<br>
<br>
     Anyway reguarding gear, I don't think your doing too bad.  The main thing I see is your low amount of sta and in turn hitpoints.  Like other people suggested I would swap the 7 wis ring out for another Velium Fire Opal ring and pick up an Idol since you can camp it solo, it just takes some time.  Also switching your earrings out for electrum black sapphire earrings might not be a bad idea. <p>Quiero Venatissimo, Level 60 Warlord

I said the stuns that you cast are much more efficient than the bracer. You take 1.5 seconds to cast stun (for a measly 30mana) and it is stunned for 3 seconds. 10 second recycle on Stun. While that is going on, you swing once, cast Holy might (for 60mana, 2.5 secon casting time). With just these two spells,  you can keep a mob stunned for well over 50% of the time, providing you don't get resisted. The bracer just gets in the way. Too long to cast to be useful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufantamosaxefist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fantamos Axefist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/1/01 12:57:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins... useless?</span><hr size=1> wow I read all of this  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Every single word.

Like that old post from Plainswalker asking if rangers had outlived their usefulness. Anyone remember that one? I do and Fenye was the first one to say rangers sucked the worst post 50 and the only good rangers were the ones she &quot;trained&quot; to be good rangers. Fenya sorry but that was a crock and this is too. Looks like you hit the hybrid pinch and don't like it much. You probably made it farther then most of the other paladins though before realizing you had to change your role just like all the rangers did. Paladins aren't useless and neither are rangers. No class in this game is useless if the person behind the keyboard knows how to drive em. Sure your damage outout may pale by comparison but SK damage output isn't all that great either. Your still a tank but now you need to figure out the best way to be that tank and not be a &quot;lamb&quot; for raids, just like the rangers had to figure out how to still do lots of damage and be able to survive without being a mana drain to the healers. We had to futz around with weapon and spell combos to do that, maybe that's what you need to do. Like some thers have said grab some friends, go somewhere and figure out what you need to do to be a needed part of your group and lvl some instead of moping about thinking your useless.<br>

<br>
And maybe, just maybe, before launching into me like that, you should have read my post in the whole on that particular ranger thread. Did I say rangers were useless? nope. Did I say the only ones that were good ones were the ones I had &quot;trained&quot;? nope.<br>
<br>
What I said was that the rangers who nuked, dual wielded procing weapons and wore fast haste items were retards if they wanted to survive. And that pretty much summed up the lot of you. <br>
<br>
But..<br>
<br>
Funny how after my rather harsh post regarding some advice on how to fix your ranger aggro problems, everyone pretty much did what I said. Got higher ac items, dropped the haste items or dropped the procing weapons, casted less.. etc.<br>
<br>
Ask Tanari. She followed my advice. She's doing better than almost every ranger I see now.<br>
<br>
And once again, don't bring up past incidents when 1) you can't remember anything about the post other than your disgruntled feelings towards it, 2) have nothing new to say about it, and finally 3) are just looking for nothing more than to try to start trouble. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleewei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leewei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 624<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/1/01 10:48:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Something to consider</span><hr size=1> The critical arguments at work here seem to be two things:<br>

Let's compare paladins to warriors.  According to what I've heard, a paladin is supposedly capable of achieving 2/3 of the melee damage of a warrior when hasted and wielding a good weapon.  Paladin AC and HPs are inferior to warriors as well, however they are by no means negligible.<br>
<br>
Paladins have mana, largely usable for stuns and backup heals.<br>
<br>
When protecting a soft point (i.e. non-tank), the 1.5 second stun seems to be a very ideal means to peel a mob off of a caster.  A heal thrown onto the caster could well save the him from death and simultaneously draw a mob onto the paladin for more effective tanking.  Warriors have Taunt and melee damage, but the advantage when keeping other groupmates alive is clearly the paladin's.<br>
<br>
Now let's compare the paladin to a cleric.  High level cleric heals and buffs are unmatchable by a paladin.  The paladin has melee damage that will certainly exceed what the cleric is capable of.<br>
<br>
When a cleric heals someone and picks up too much aggro, a paladin is still very handy.  Stun, heals, root are all good methods to use when peeling a critter off of someone.  The cleric gets to return to medition that much faster.<br>
<br>
Hopefully these two comparisons will show where paladins really shine.  I've grouped with many high level paladins who were all very good at keeping a mob's attention and surviving.  In light of this, I don't think badly of the class at all!<br>
