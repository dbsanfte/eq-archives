<br>
To use the 3 Veilous ports, Great Divide, Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar, you need a tooth from that ring. The tooth is a ground spawn in the center of the ring it is for. In other words, you have to walk there once, pick up the tooth off the ground, and from that point on, you can port to that ring (the tooth must be ON you, not in the bank).  The Great Divide tooth will allow you to port to only Great Divide. The Wakening Lands tooth will allow you to port to both Wakening lands AND Great Divide. The Cobalt Scar tooth will allow you to port to ALL 3. <br>
<br>
Everyone in the group must have a tooth, or they will not be ported. <br>
<br>
The teeth are also soul bound. In other words, when you die, the tooth stays with you, not your corpse. So if you die in Cobalt Scar for example, you can still port back there to get your corpse. <br>
<br>
Finally: Zoning into Cobalt Scar from Skyshrine requires a CS Key. This is not to be confused with a CS tooth. The CS key is obtained either by killing a 35ish drake, or completing a simple (but somewhat expensive) quest. The key will allow you to zone an entire group into Cobat Scar, but only from the pool room in Skyshrine. It is not a &quot;port&quot; it is actually a key that unlocks a &quot;door&quot;. The tooth is a key needed for a port. Everyone has to have their own tooth for the port, but the key only requires one person in the group to have it. It also doesn't require a spell to be cast, like the port does, so anyone can use it. You do not need a CS Key in order to port into CS, only a CS tooth. <br>
<br>
One word of caution: The Wakening Land port is guarded by a level 65 dragon on Claws of Veeshan faction. If you are KOS to CoV, you will probably die. The Cobalt Scar ring is guarded by a couple of Cobalt Drakes, also on CoV faction. They are more along the lines of level 42 or so, but still dangerous. The dragon in WL (Wuoshi) sees invis.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

I was told about the same thing that Robert Defuego mentioned, and tried it.<br>
The rider was indeed ported.<br>
I got the message in red &quot;That zone is currently down, sending you to a safe point in this zone&quot; (or similar wording).<br>
I was in front of Kaladim, the port had taken place from the BB druid ring. So, we chuckled about it, he said his friend had ported him that way about 3 times with nothing untoward happening.<br>
So, I tried to sit to mem the Ring of Toxx...and got the message &quot;you cannot use that command while casting&quot;. I tried sitting, same thing happened after I stood. I tried to cast another spell and got the message &quot;you haven't recovered yet&quot;. I attacked a snake to see if the weapon would work, and it did. Forage worked as well.<br>
I finally had to camp to the character selection screen to clear it.<br>
Not a big problem, just letting you know that it happened.<br>

I think anytime you do something not as it was intended the situation can get buggy.  For example, the trick where people use to stack treeform and lev and could  walk around but sometimes would  fall through the planet to their death.  I guess it falls under the category of &quot;use at your own risk&quot;. <p>Robart Defuego <BR>

What is the default faction standing with CoV? Threatningly or Scowls?<br>
I read the quest needed to complete for getting the SS to CS key, and it seems like I need to find someone in Kael Drakkal and give him 200p and the note from the guy that gives the quest in SS. It seems more expensive and risky than killing a Lvl 35 Drake, so where do I find this Drake? Can you spare more details about this way of getting the CS key?<br>
And another thing, I found out porting or getting ported to WL is risky no matter what your standing with CoV, since Woushi uses AE spells, which will kill you in seconds even if he's attacking some nearby mob or player and not you directly. So better just find out whether he's up or not.<br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukatlynel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katlynel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/26/01 10:16:38 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.asianavenue.com/indiegrrl/faedrake.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: correction to my previous post</span><hr size=1> Wuoshi's AE does not actually do damage; it has a poison-based stun component and the usual dragon fear component. But yes, you would be stuck standing there until he killed the other player or NPC and stopped aggroing. (theoretically. I haven't tried it.)<br>
<br>
The default faction to CoV is scowls, at least it was for me. The easiest thing to do would simply be to kill the key guy. If you're lucky and there's a group exping, they might kill the guy for you. Or, if you don't feel the need to have the key, i.e., you're planning on porting in to CS, then you could probably ask someone who's hunting in the courtyard to group you real quick and click the portal to zone you into Cobalt Scar.<br>
<br>
If you want to do it the hard way, then here goes. Ziglark Whisperwing is the drake you want to kill. Invis and zone in to SS from WL. Go through the gate and turn right and around the corner, and you'll be in a room with a room to the left and a hallway to the right. The room to the left should have Ziglark Whisperwing and maybe a couple of sentry types. Whisperwing will be way green and a pretty easy kill, the golems around him don't stay rooted very well though.<br>
<br>
Once you have your key, reinvis, go back to the gate area, only turn left instead of right.  Take the first left you can take, then turn right and go up the stairway, and go straight through two gates and you'll see a courtyard with a big pool that has an urn thing in the middle of it.  Click your key on the urn to zone in to CS.<br>
