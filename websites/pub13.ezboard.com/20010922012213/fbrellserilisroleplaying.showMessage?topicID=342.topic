<br>
here's what someone did for a summary<br>
===============================<br>
The log of the Steamfont event basically says this:<br>
<br>
1) Lanys T`Vyl has the first piece of Malevolence, an ancient artifact of incredible evil power that was dismantled long ago, and is currently looking for the second piece which is presumed to be in the possession of the Ring of Scale. The third piece, a gem, was given to Mayong Mistmoore for safe keeping.<br>
<br>
2) Mayong Mistmoore is not allied with Lanys, Neriak, or anyone else.<br>
<br>
3) There is no Norrath-wide war approaching. <br>
<br>
Lanys' forces and the armies of Neriak are preparing to fight one another, not the forces of light. <br>
<br>
The Cazic/Tunare/Firiona event is unrelated to the Qeynos/Bloodsabre/Bertoxxulous event. They are not all connected; the rumors of them being so are just that, rumors, with no basis in fact.<br>
<br>
4) Lanys would become a nearly unstoppable power with the whole Malevolence in her grasp.<br>
