<br>
I do find it kinda absurd that a level 40ish Wizard mob can nuke for 300 to 600 damage, and melee for as much damage as a 40ish warrior. <br>
<br>
I do see the point about mind numbing exp camps as well though, but you had choices. You could do a single group grind in Velks or FG and go insane, or you could take your 58+ group to Akheva/acrylia/chardok and crawl. Some of the crawling oppurtunities are gone, if you have to use excessive mana per mob to mitigate damage and overcome new obstacles.<br>
<br>
I don't see it effecting AE groups though, unless they can kill the puller before he gets back to AE stun radius.<br>

<br>
If caster mobs had HPs and melee stats similar to PCs, they would be absolutely too easy to kill.  I don't think it would be difficult enough if a high level wizard NPC had 1000 hit points and hit for max 15s.<br>
<br>
I think the same sort of thing applies to their ability to land spells and which spells they can cast.  There are plenty of NPC spells that PCs can't cast.  Would you like to say they should only have spells PCs get as well?  Maybe we should say they can't land spells on PCs more than 6 levels above their own level too.  Would you like fries with that?<br>
<br>
I think the way to think about NPC abilities is what makes the mob difficult enough to kill but not overly difficult.  Putting arbitrary limitations on NPCs because &quot;they shouldn't be able to do things PCs can't do&quot; would make balancing encounters a lot more difficult. <p><BR>

It's bad enough that in allot of places (ME for example) if your not careful Dark blue cons will wipe the floor with you. I do understand why the do it though. With the decent drops there you should be made to work harder. With No named mobs however being 100% Melee and 100% caster that's ridiculous. On named or Epic mobs I can see the point. No PC's have this ability why should mere Dark and Light blue cons be able to. again I play at off peak hours this meaning lots of soloing. This will at the very least make things allot more interesting. and increase down time quite a bit. I'm all for balance but light blues with abilities like this that's not balance.<br>

This will make us more valuable, and I feel most useful when fighting either casters or mobs. Rarely can a blue mob get a spell off if I'm fighting it, and that makes me feel very useful. I soloed Brother Jentry (40th level I think) the other night while friends killed Lucan, and he barely hit me and never got a spell off. Serving a useful purpose makes the game FUN.<br>
<br>
I agree that this is a nerf. Mobs just got tougher for everyone and only some people (through focus items) became a little more power. For everyone else, downtime and danger were increased. I don't think there's anyway to logically claim otherwise, but I also haven't experienced the new casting AI myself, either.<br>
<br>
Those two views are not inconsistent. A nerf can make the game more fun - or at least make ENCOUNTERS more fun. If it's too much of a nerf, then levelling will become too painful and it won't be a good trade for more fun encounters (unless you are finished with levels and AA...).<br>
<br>
Also, I have to say that claiming &quot;you're 60th level so you just don't care that others have it hard - delete your character and start off if you don't think it's bad&quot; is one of the goofiest ad hominem arguments I've ever seen!<br>
<br>
First, you make the irrational assumption that they feel that way because they are 60th level. Unless I missed something, there aren't a lot of people running around with all the AA skills they want. This nerf will take it longer to get AA points, just as it will (might) slow levelling.<br>
<br>
Second, challenging someone to delete their character is just a straw man argument. Why would someone need to prove to you, especially in such an extreme fashion, they they don't care about the increase in difficulty? You are just poisoning the well by attempting to claim that if someone doesn't do as you ask, then they are wrong. This is 2nd grade logic.<br>
<br>
Third, if you didn't level through the times when we were outright gimps, your complaints about this increase in difficulty can be hard to take seriously. Many of the people on this board were already high level when the level requirement for bash was dropped, when we were first given a range attack (I was 17th level before I could pull at range), etc. etc. By arguing that a 60th level character is just happy because they didn't have to go through this much harder levelling experience, you denigrate the labor they went through to get where they are.<br>
<br>
You are certainly entitled to your opinion and I don't believe you should go away because it differs from others. However, you can't expect people not to take offense when your opinion, as it was stated, is inherently insulting. You are the one who tried to say that others' opinions weren't as valid in your original post.<br>
<br>
Anyway... it'll take a little time to see what the effects of this change are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aeka>Aeka</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight of the Realm</span><br>  Posts: 1426<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/7/02 8:11:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good and bad</span><hr size=1> Go Romidar go! ^_^<br>
<br>
I don't know how this topic got off into bad feelings.  I simply suggested that &quot;hey!  this is interesting!&quot;  The same old Sebilis was pretty much the same old Sebilis released in Kunark.  Instead of completely redoing the zone like Chardok, why not tweak the template of monsters that spawn.  I am all for revamping old zones but I want them to also seek &quot;retweaking&quot; some of them too.<br>
<br>
I think what Verant noticed is that classes have gotten strong enough that some where AE-ing in places they shouldn't be in older zones like Sebilis for fast and easy exp.  It was starting to cause grief and problems again.  If their intent was to retune the zone then they got part of the solution: put appropriate strength spells on the caster monsters.  However this has to be done gentily or it quickly becomes unfun.<br>
<br>
If Verant wants to make smarter monsters they should pattern what the player choose to do.  An Enchanter monster should preference to strip and debuf a target before messing with it.  Why don't high level Warrior monsters have /disc defensive(hello??  easy caster balance thing right here!!)?  Why doesn't a Cleric monster use Divine Intervention in a last ditch effort to get away?  This isn't as bad as it seems if you properly debuf...a dispell will stop it.  Of course if monsters start acting like this I expect the exp value of them to go way up. ^_^<br>
<br>
I guess my other point is that players are resilent that many think.  If new behaviors are introduced that are &quot;playable&quot; people will figure out new ways to attack them.<br>
<br>
To reiterate: New behavior to same old moldy zone is a good thing.  However making it too hard isn't.  I'm willing to give Verant a little leway if they are willing to continue to tweak the situation.  Unresistable charming for instance is unfair.  However an Enchanter monster probably should get a shot at charming any player.  The players should get a shot at stoping said monster from doing it. <p><font size="+1">

Why would you want to fight a caster mob that can melee almost as good as a melee mob, but also drop and Ice Comet on you?<br>
<br>
I remember back when I was in about my 30's I would try and stay away from caster mobs, because they hit so hard and could cast.  Fighting stuff in FM with my bard friend, if we aggroed a caster most of the time we would just zone, because they where not worth the trouble.<br>
<br>
I would like the changes more if they made the caster more in line with how PCs are.  Obvisouly dont give them PC level melee and hit points, but have the ratio similar.  So if a PC caster has on average 40% less HP than a melee, then a caster NPC should have about 40% less hp than a NPC mob.  Maybe it doesnt have to be exact, but somewhat similar.  That would be a big improvement.<br>
<br>
Basically what they have done is totaly messed up the balance by making all caster NPC much harder.<br>
<br>
However even with these changes, it is still easier to level than it was back in the day.  40% exp penalty, unbalance 2h weps, small mana pool, that thing that re set attack when you would cast a spell.....Im only 59 (and lots of these thing were fixed when I was mid levels), anyone who made it 60 with all those issues (not to mention way crappier gear) deserves some serious respect.  Complaining that game is too hard to level now is nuts and insulting to those people who leveled when it really was hard, IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzarraa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zarraa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/7/02 9:40:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Here we go again...</span><hr size=1> I thought we were past that stage If you read my above post I apologized.

<br>
Caster MOBs have always been a joke if single pulled. And lets face it, for your average group single pulling or crowd control is well practiced. Arcane casters drop faster and hit for less than warrior MOBs.<br>
<br>
I don't think there should be any reduction in their AC or damage. If that was done a full group could drop them before they got more than two or three spells off.<br>
<br>
I also think the idea of MOBs being able to land spells on higher level PCs is a good idea. By reducing the 'level' based effect on resists, you can take some of the 'easy money' out of bottom feeding/farming without upping the danger level for PCs of the appropriate levels. Lets face it, if a very green MOB is casting on you, then 90% of the time you've done something directly to it.<br>
<br>
BTW, I do agree that some long time lvl 60s start over ( make an alt, don't delete anyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but for a much nicer reason. A lot of content and power has been added to the game. The days of a crowded SOLa are long gone, but that just means there are a lot of dungoens/zones that brave parties can battle through in peace. There are a lot of wonderfull lowbie zones now and you don't know what you're missing (bring friends though, dungeon groups are hard to find).<br>
