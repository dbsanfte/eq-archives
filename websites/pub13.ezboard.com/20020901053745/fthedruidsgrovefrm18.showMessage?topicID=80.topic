<br>
Another important aspect of being a druid has been inflicting damage: DDs, AoEs, PBAEs, and DoTs.   I don't really see any major holes with our area-effect spells, based on what we've been able to do historically.   With the new Ancient spell tweak for our fire based DD, and with expected fixes to Moonfire for our cold based DD, I think our DD line has received all the attention it's going to get right now.<br>
<br>
That leaves DoTs.  There is a fairly big hole in our DoT line at the upper end.  We've gotten insect-based DoTs every ten levels, with two fire-based DoTs tossed in, but they stopped at 53.  That leaves room for a nice DoT at 59 or 60.  For the sake of argument, I'll use 60, since both necros and shaman get big DoTs at 60.  And since our insect line is resisted less than our fire lines, let's go for the former.  <br>
<br>
Let's call our imaginary level 60 DoT "Winged Fury" for now, for ease of reference.  First, we'll see where it fits into our current DoT line.  Second, we'll compare it to what the necros and shaman (the two main DoT classes that we closely follow) have, to make sure we don't step on any toes.<br>
<br>
Step One: DoT Analysis<br>
<br>
Stinging Swarm: 117 pts, 65 mana, 1.80 dam/mana<br>
Creeping Crud: 210 pts, 100 mana, 2.10 dam/mana<br>
Immolate: 240 pts, 120 mana, 2.00 dam/mana<br>
Drones of Doom: 340 pts, 141 mana, 2.41 dam/mana<br>
Drifting Death: 650, 200 mana, 3.25 dam/mana<br>
Breath of Ro: 920, 	250 mana, 3.68 dam/mana<br>
Winged Death: 1287, 350 mana, 3.68 dam/mana<br>
<br>
Duration is 10 ticks for the first and last spells, 11 ticks for the others, of course.  Also note that I am using the LISTED damage numbers for the DoTs to make comparisons easier.  I do not include any server-side increase (which would apply across the board anyway).<br>
<br>
As you can see, there is a steady increase in mana cost and damage/mana ratio, and thus an increase in damage.  Also, as noted, the duration is fairly constant.  So, let's assume that there is a 450 mana cost, and increase in the damage/mana ratio to 4.4.  We then get:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Winged Fury: 1980, 450 mana, 4.4 dam/mana<br>
(duration 10 ticks)</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Not bad, but how does it fit within the limits established by the necro and shaman DoTs?  Answer: very well.  <br>
<br>
Necro DoTs:<br>
Lvl 56-Cessation of Cor: 1000, 250 mana, 4.0 dam/mana (10 ticks)<br>
Lvl 58-Pyrocuror: 1998, 400 mana, 4.995 dam/mana (18 ticks)<br>
Lvl 60-Funeral Pyre: 2160, 450 mana, 4.8 dam/mana (10 ticks)<br>
<br>
Shaman DoTs:<br>
Lvl 56-Bane of Nife: 1648, 425 mana, 3.88 dam/mana (7 ticks)<br>
Lvl 59-Pox of Bert: 2090, 430 mana, 4.86 dam/mana (20 ticks)<br>
Lvl 60-Scourge of Nife: 1955, 425 mana, 4.6 dam/mana (7 ticks)<br>
<br>
<br>
As you can see, Winged Fury does its job of keeping druids in third place on the DoT ladder.  The closest analogue is Funeral Pyre, which costs the same mana and has the same duration, but does 180 more points of damage (and thus has a much higher damage/mana rate).  The level 58 necro DoT beats Winged Fury as well in total damage and efficiency.<br>
<br>
The level 59 shaman DoT does more damage for less mana (and has a high efficiency).  While the level 60 shaman DoT does a little less total damage, it does that damage in 70% of the time, so the damage per tick is quite a bit higher.  Shaman also have a mana savings.<br>
<br>
So, overall, Winged Fury would not challenge either of the top two shaman or necro DoTs.  <br>
<br>
There is, in fact, some room for Winged Fury to do more damage and have a slightly better efficiency (say, 4.5 or so), without infringing on shaman or necros.  However, that would push the damage over the 2000 mark.  My gut feeling is that there might be some psychological resistance to a druid DoT doing more than 2000 listed damage.   <br>
<br>
Besides, 1980 was a good year...:) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A> at: 2/25/02 3:16:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubaubenpeachins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BaubenPeachins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 6:28:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What would a druid level 60 DoT look like?</span><hr size=1> the lv60 druid DoT looks like this:<br>

Nice analysis too.  Here's another idea:<br>
<br>
<b>Gale of Karana: 1650, 375 mana, -30 CR, -60 ATK, 11 tick duration</b><br>
<br>
Gale is a cold-based counterpart and upgrade to Breath of Ro.  It brings a 4.4 damage/mana ratio without the big damage of Winged Fury, but also provides a few nice debuffs.  The cold-resist debuff would help land spells like Blizzard and Frost.  It would be a high-maintenance ATK debuff, hopefully stackable with FoR and RSD.<br>
<br>
I'd be happy with either of these DoTs.<br>

However, why not formulate one for level 58 or 59, then let it grow a bit as the druid levels up to 60?  Being level 60 isn't essential for being in the high end raiding game, except to the extent that our spell line up makes it so.  So why dig a deeper hole for people who are 59 and four yellow bubbles?<br>
<br>
I also have a small quibble with this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Another important aspect of being a druid has been inflicting damage: DDs, AoEs, PBAEs, and DoTs.

<br>
While what you say is true of our DD's and targetted AoE's, I don't think it's true of our PBAoE's.  There our last spell is Upheaval at level 51.  Upheaval is very slow, especially with respect to its 24 second recovery time, and also inefficient.  I would like to see druids have something meaningful to contribute to an AoE group.  That's not going to be a useful stun.  If it can't be a heal, then why not an improved PBAoE?  The ideal case, in my mind, would be that we could bring flexibility to such a group.  We would get an upgraded PBAoE that was still inferior to a 60 wizard's, and a group heal that was clearly inferior to the cleric's version, but we would have the opportunity to choose which was most appropriate at the moment to add survivability to the group.<br>

I do think you are aiming a bit too low with the damage/mana ratio (4.2 vs. my 4.4), and we don't have any dots with 9 tick durations, so go with 10 or 11.  Interesting that we both derive the same damage/tick (198)...:)<br>
<br>
I did consider doing an upgrade for the Immo/BoR line, but I decided not to for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
1. The swarm line has a super-low resistance rate.  That's a big advantage for a high mana cost spell.  As Tudamorf says (his post is in the Archive under the DoT thread), this potentially makes the druid the king of DoTs.<br>
<br>
2. The swarm line is simpler to consider and put into effect.  It does damage, that's it.  You don't have to consider the effects of various debuffs (all of which will increase the resistance rate as well).  It is also easier to make a case for higher damage with swarm because we don't have any debuffs.<br>

3. We do have a swarm line history to build upon.  In contrast, we really don't have a BoR line.  Thus, the case for an advancement in the swarm line is easier to make.  It is a natural spell that follows several previous spells.<br>
<br>
4. We just got a combination damage and debuff spell, RFD.  I consider it a bit of a push to ask for another debuff spell this soon, even with DoT damage.<br>

<br>
1. This is precisely why I am more interested in an upgrade to the Flame Lick line.  Our DoT should NOT be king.  The low resistability makes Wings of Death somewhat viable in it's current form, whereas Breath of Ro is a waste of mana unless you have an excess of healers (hah) and an extreme need to debuff AC.  A very large dot (near 2k) which is as unresistable as our Swarms would be, I think, a bit unfair to shm/nec.  Hence my slightly reduced numbers versus yours.<br>
<br>
2.  Granted.<br>
<br>
3.  Again, this is exactly why I would prefer the Flame Lick line upgrade.  If our spell lines were all just fleshed out fully, I think a lot of druids would be happier without new types of spells.  Right now, while we are supposed to be versatile, we are just limited to a couple of spell lines which are close to being developed -- Wings of Death, NT/CB, Wildfire (in conjunction with Sundering).<br>
<br>
For instance, consider the following spell lines that we have 1 or 2 spells in and that's it:<br>
<br>
Beguile Plants -- a steady progression of this, perhaps quested like the original spell is, would make us be able to have fun with various fungi in Luclin zones.  Servant of Nature (Dire Charm) should also work against plants.<br>
<br>
Careless Lightning --   Ever since they reduced the mr on many mobs and instead made them immune to slow, clerics and enchanters can nuke better on many mobs than us due to our lack of an indoor magic nuke.<br>
<br>
Fury of Air -- the one and only stun we get.  Upgrades to this would be most excellent, for stun value and for indoor magic nuke value.<br>
<br>
Fire DoT line -- should continue as shown in my first post.<br>
<br>
Glamour of Tunare -- would be nice to get one that it to Glamour that Tashanian is to Tashani.<br>
<br>
Share Wolf Form -- a form of this that adds atk, similar to Form of the Great Wolf, or even one that adds mana like Form of the Howler.<br>
<br>
Wake of Karana -- one that stops snow.<br>
<br>
Summon Drink and Food -- Abundant Drink and Food<br>
<br>
Spirit of Cheetah -- something that parallels max bard speed with the best drum, for 30 seconds, or something<br>
<br>
Sunbeam -- a single target version, and indoor version, whatever<br>
<br>
Upheaval -- definately some upgrade here, that clerics do not receive, but still inferior to mage PB AEs<br>
<br>
etc. etc. etc.<br>
<br>
So many spell lines that were just thrown in and never received any upgrades, and so we outgrow their usefulness quickly and bury them in the back of our books.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Disjunction sucks.  The increased resistance check makes it useless unless you cast sundering first.  If you are going to cast sundering first anyway, you might as well just save mana and cast fixation after, instead of Disjunction.  Unless, of course, you mean to stack Fixate and DJ, which I highly doubt is intended.<br>

<br>
Sorry, Xaviel, you're wrong.  Go and actually test the spells instead of relying on the listings at various sites, which also are wrong.  <br>
<br>
Or you can rely on the fact that I actually have tested each of our DoTs, and have confirmed that the durations are 10 and 11 ticks of damage.  See the Spells: DoT thread in the Archives for those testing results.<br>
<br>
BTW, I do know the source of the listing problem.  They presumed that our DoTs work like the DoTs of other classes, where there is an initial application of damage followed by damage per tick over time.  So when you see a listed duration for Winged Death of 9 ticks, what they really mean is 10 applications of damage: the initial plus 9 subsequent ticks.<br>
<br>
Our DoTs don't work that way...there is no initial damage.   Instead, the first application of damage occurs at the end of the first tick.  And subsequent damage is applied at the end of each tick.  The last bit of damage for Winged Death occurs at the end of the 10th tick.  The last bit of damaged for Drones of Doom, in contrast, occurs at the end of the 11th tick.  <br>
<br>
Believe me, I have sat and watched each bit of damage each tick for each DoT take effect (testing on myself).  I know for a fact that the duration is 10 or 11 ticks, not 9.<br>
<br>
I also know that the listed damage is wrong.  But that's another story.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxaviel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaviel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 9:41:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Well enough, then.

I still hold to the rest of my post, though... I think the upgrade to BoR with a standard resist and fizzle rate would serve us better than an upgrade to Wings... both would be logical and ideal, of course. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1638<br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 9:52:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Scirocco says:  <b><i>Winged Fury: 1980, 450 mana, 4.4 dam/mana<br>

<br>
You're conveniently dancing around the resist rate factor, which you <b>know</b> skews those numbers.  Normal DoTs are usually resisted at least 10-15% of the time against average resist targets, meaning their efficiency will be significantly less than what is listed, whereas swarms are resisted no more than about 5% against any NPC, even ones with very high resists.<br>
<br>
Necros and shamans do have a low-resist "comeback" for the low 50s -- splurt and the shaman epic effect -- but if you give druids a low-resist level 60 DoT, necros and shamans will be left wanting, like children who were passed over for the lollipop.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, as High Priest of PvV you should be painfully aware that any such discussion will focus everyone's attention to the ultra-low resist property of the swarm line, a fact which is relatively unknown to other classes.  This may engender envy in some members of those classes, who will scream for a nerf to the already supremely overpowered Everquest class (druids).  You know what will likely happen next -- an across the board nerf to everyone, as Verant suddenly realizes that DoTs aren't "working as intended".  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 2/25/02 6:53:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 553<br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 11:37:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> i'm going to touch on not just dots here, but this has bothered me for a while...<br>
something commonly overlooked is our lack of damage spell upgrades.  we have received.... NONE since kunark (except moonfire and i will refuse to acknowledge its existence until it becomes a viable spell that is at LEAST better than our lvl 49 cold nuke).  enchanters, clerics, shaman, necros, wizards, magis, you name it, have received upgrades dots or dds or in some cases both.<br>
<br>
DDs:  we need to make an argument to remove the outdoor only restriction from BoK.  ideally they would get rid of all non-movement outdoor-only restrictions on spells, since the game has grown since release to the point that the high majority of high level hunting is now indoors.  druids are really the only class crippled by stepping foot into a dungeon.  BoK is important as it is our only higher level decent damage magic check nuke.  against mobs that are only magic susceptible, we cant nuke at all.  i would also advocate removing the stun portion of the spell as that increases the resists, and would be an easy price to pay to make this spell indoor usable.<br>
<br>
<br>
**important thing to note here**<br>
as for dots, i would really prefer a swarm line BUT.... and i havent see anyone mention this yet.... we have to look at stackability.  if its swarm line, that means we are stuck with it and boro, yes?  uncomfortable idea in my eyes.  i would rather have an upgrade to boro, with or without the fire debuff since im not sure what would be best, and use that and wd as our top dots.  plus as the flame line, which is evocation, it would give a slight edge to our evoc brethren over the nothing bonus that 99% of us get from the winged line.  and it makes little sense to me to replace the higher level higher damage spell with an upgrade when we could instead get rid of that bitch of a spell BoR.<br>
<br>
as for dot level and damage, i think i would rather see it at 58 or 59... mainly because they've started doing some really nasty things with our lvl 60 spells, and i'd rather see this spell come in and be achievable by the majority of druids than see it stuffed onto a remote lvl 70 mob somewhere in the depths of luclin as &quot;loot&quot; where only 5% of us will ever see it.  the damage should at least be somewhere in the 1700-2000 ballpark to make it much of an improvement over either the lvl 52 or 54 dots. <p>-K<br>

<br>
I'm not sure that I buy into the notion that the swarm series really has a super low resist.  True, I rarely see it resisted.  But I also have to observe that it's not flagged in SPDAT as having a low resist.  Personally, I think that spells with multiple resistable effects do have increased opportunities for resists.  Regardless of whether they do or not, though, let's assume that they do and compare like to like here...<br>
<br>
All shaman DoT spells have multiple effects.  Further, I'm thinking that they're probably also &quot;all or nothing&quot; spells, at least to the extent that if the initial damage component is completely resisted the rest of the spell fails as well.  I don't think we can fairly compare resists on Shaman and druid spells.<br>
<br>
The same applies to a lot of necro spells.  The disease and poison spells seem to be little different from shaman spells, and the darkness series includes a snare component.  The two spell lines that appear to come close to druid DoT's would be the Leach series and the Heat Blood series.  My experience with my necro is quite limited (level 13), but I seem to recall these spells being among my favorites because they had lower resists!<br>
<br>
So, Tudamorf, I guess I would have to say that I don't buy the notion that resist factor is a problem.  Low resists for druid swarm dots are normal across all levels, but I think it's simply the mechanics of how the spell works.   I would expect an upgrade to also be low resist, while still preserving about the same damage proportion relative to other classes that was seen at lower levels.  I hardly think that keeping a spell line proportional across levels is unreasonable.  And let's face it...  An upgraded swarm dot isn't much of a lollipop when it comes to druids in the high end game.  Looks to me like a reason for one druid to be at the raid, since DoT's don't stack.<br>

They're favorites to be used in pvp (as your mr stat doesn't help in resisting), their only downsides are that they are so easily removed (pumice, dispel), which make them useless against an experienced player..<br>
