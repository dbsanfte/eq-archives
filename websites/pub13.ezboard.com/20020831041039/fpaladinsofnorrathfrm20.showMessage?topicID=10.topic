If your group is in their 30-40s, I suggest two groups to be safe.  At least that has been my experience in the few times we have killed him.  I dont think 27, 31, 47 and a cleric are going to be enough to kill what you have to get through to find him, then have enough to kill him and the couple of others that seem to come with him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 883<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 9:29:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xicotl...

SK of Mistmoore</span><hr size=1> If you intend on living in the zone, you will eventually run across a group or guild that is going in there to raid.  My suggestion would be to ask if you might join them or if you might loot the Hilt should they kill him.  It will be totally up to them. You will probably find they are higher level than you and possibly will refuse you as a mana drain on their clerics; however, when we have been there hunting, he has spawned several times and often adds with other pulls and needs to be killed several times over.   Once the pally in the group (me) had the first hilt, we shouted to the zone that the Hilt had dropped and we had several pallies that came up to the room through the back way and looted the hilt. If you are deadset on killing him yourself, you will need levels and more group members.  If you don't mind a donated Hilt, and are in the area, listen for the shout and up you go. Not sure if the DEs on the way can see invis, but its worth a shot to carry some potions.  If you know the way and can run up there quickly, you won't find a ton of really hard mobs in the way.  Check to see if invis works.  ITU will do nothing to protect you in there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaragirlancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aragir Lancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 886<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/1/02 11:23:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Throw Xicotl from the catwalk!</span><hr size=1> Whoa!  don't give up, that's FAR from what I'm saying.<br><br>But you need to be aware of the specific... challenges... that you are facing with him.

You may have read about the hideous trains in mistmoore.  They can be extreme indeed, so make sure to have an enchanter there to mez the adds (there will be adds) and you should do fine.<br><br>There is an issue invising up to where xicotl spawns because there is a mix of reg. mobs and undead mobs that roam that area, that's why you pretty much have to clear the way to him, but you can usually invis all the way to the library inside the castle before that begins to be an issue.<br><br>When I got my soulfire at level 45, I was an extremely happy paladin.

The pathing is simply obscence and the size of trains coming from inside the castle is unbelievable. My main is a level 55 necro and he's had to gate out before, although it does get a lot easier as you learn the pathing. I even know a lvl 59 ranger that died in MM. So don't feel bad that you're having trouble, your in a zone that most players are simply too afraid to go to. Although it is where my necro spent a lot of the 30s-40s whenever I could drag some friends over to group with me. <p>Rhadamanthus Level 52 Exp Leech (Necr0)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usanthebmoonstare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santheb Moonstare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 12:32:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xicotl...

Think we had a wizzy too.  Well finally Xicotl spawned when I pulled a train and ran in on us, the 56 ranger started tanking him and I was killing casters and I died lol (level 38) and then the ranger kills Xicotl and ranger gets nuked.  Druid and necro left and thank god for this guy (if your on Bristlebane and you see Marvel/Mervil/Mervin, tell him hi for me cause I dont see him very much.  GREAT guy in my opinion)...he sacrificed his druid to rez me with some rez spell necros get.  I loot the corpse and yay after 3 hours we get outta MM.<br><br>So I am going to turn in Hilt and didnt check faction, think I was amiably though cause I follow Nife and I never messed with faction.  I was like the big newb of all time cause of this.<br><br>We found Bro Hayle, I killed his little pals around him and handed in the note and got whatever back and then I did this..<br><br>I thought that my ACG was a Brilliant Sword of Faith so I put ACG, the hilt and the rest in the trade window and hit trade.  Didnt get it, got pissed.  Later on that day a newb SK inspected me and said what are the stats on that sword and I said the stats of ACG and he ran off.  I noticed the sword was glowing, I looked at it and read &quot;Brilliant Sword of Faith&quot;.  I was like holy crap...no.<br><br>Quit my pally then and didnt play him for 2 months and then sold everything on my twink druid and got him back in action hehe.<br><br>Later on I just took a 45 paladin and a 56 cleric and we ganked Xicotl...waited 3 hours on New Years lol, I got another BSoF, and did the quests again and made sure I handed in everything right, and got SoulFire.  <br><br>Total time quested: I am gonna say 15 hours <p>Santheb Moonstare--53rd level Cavalier of Rodcet Nife.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthaedson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaedson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 7:56:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xicotl...

Piggy backed behind a level 60 Paladin who was working on faction and killing everything that moved inside of Mistmoore.  My wife and I followed her in and camped out the Bath while the killing machine took out everything in the vicinity.<br><br>  Three pops of &quot;Mistmoore Guard&quot; and Xicotl appeared.  It was exciting, the Harm Touch is kind of scary when your LOH is gone, but he dropped.  Got the hilt, ran to Felwithe and logged for the night.<br><br>  On Saturday I went to Splitpaw and walked back to the prison invisible.  Hayle shares his cell with a couple Gnolls so I killed them first.  Conned Hayle and showed up &quot;warmly&quot;... praying to the gods I gave him the Note and he gave me back a piece of paper.<br><br>  I then turned in the paper, the Sword of Brilliance (Lucan), my testimony and the hilt.
