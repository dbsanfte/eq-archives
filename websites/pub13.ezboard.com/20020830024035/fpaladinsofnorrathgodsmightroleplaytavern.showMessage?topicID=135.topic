A candle. In this house, the a man known as Glorek was sitting on a chair next to a bed on which his wife named Joleila, a beautiful Elven woman was laying. He was holding her hand because she was feeling pain. She was about to born a child. After some hours of pain it happened. The child saw the light of the world. The father took the child, washed it with a smile on his lips and after that, he gave the child to Joleila. It was a cute little boy and Glorek and Joleila already had a name for him: Khalim.<br>
The years passed by and Glorek was working in his blacksmith shop as he did before Khalim was born. Khalim of course grew bigger behaving like every other child at his age. He loved to play with other childs in Qeynos and he always was a nice young boy. He never felt very bad and when he got injured while playing, his wounds healed very fast. Faster than wounds of others. Everything seemed wonderful but one night when Khalim was sleeping, he had a dream. It was a more like a nightmare. He saw people of many races. Small people with long beards, bigger people with ears like he had and humans like his father was. They all were wearing Shining armor and were wielding swords that were burning. These people were in the middle of a big fight. Ugly Monster were trying to slay these people. It was brutal and bloody and many people went down, blood dripping out of their wounds. Many were screaming in pain, others shouting something like: &quot;Watch out!!!! Behind you!!!!&quot; The other turned around, swinging his burning blade in his hands, cutting the head off of a monster looking like foul beast. Others were kneeing next to fallen comrades, that just got brutally slaughtered by these beasts, whispering words that noone could understand. Then the fallen opened their eyes, breathed a big time and stood up. Others were standing next to the one that just stood up and whispered words too. Suddenly the wounds stopped letting blood. The man's lips fromed to a smiling mouth and he charged the monsters again. Then someone stepped away from the battle wandering to Khalim. He smiled at him and started to speak. The man had a nice light voice but something was different. The voice seemed to be in Khalim's head. The man asked Khalim: &quot;Do you see these brave men?&quot;, &quot;Yes, M'Lord!&quot;, was Khalim's answer. &quot;There are not many of these brave people all over Norrath, little boy. These people sacrifice their lives for the good and the right. I, Rodcet Nife lead these men and women to protect the the ones that need help. To protect the good. To beat the Evil. And you, my son will be one of these brave men too! You are a chosen one!&quot;, &quot;Why?!&quot;, Khalim asked but the man was already wandering back to the battlefield, his hands shimmering in a beautiful blue light.<br>
Then, Khalim woke up, sweating and feeling cold. It was day already and so he decided to get up. He played with the other childs in his neighborhood as he usually did. He became thirsty and went back to home to grab something to drink, as his father suddenly opened the door! He then ran into the kitchen and Khalim wondered why Glorek was so hasting but then he looked at the surface and saw blood. He ran into the kitchen too and saw the cause for the blood on the surface. A huge wound in the arm of glorek was bloodying very strong. &quot;What happened, father?!&quot;, Khalim asked. &quot;When i was grabbing a sword out of the shelf, another sword fell down and sliced my arm.&quot;, Glorek answered. Khalim of course was feeling with his dad and then he touched his fathers arm to stop the bloodying. He wished the wound would disappear so his father would feel good again and then it happened: A light blue shimmer surrounded Khalims hands, Small lights jumped around and wandered over Gloreks arm, letting the wound disappear....<br>
Only a small idea from me.<br>
