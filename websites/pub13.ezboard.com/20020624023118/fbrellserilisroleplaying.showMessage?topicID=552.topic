It was demeaning, that a War Wizard of the Empire and Chancellor of the Imperial Council should have to skulk about in the drainage system like a common thief. But, this city was the home of the long dead Human Paladin Antonius Bayle, and there were many traps and spells to detect those of the Darkness with it’s walls. So the group of Teir’dal traveled through the maze of damp, underground corridors, until they eventually found the route to the surface. Tzlar would not even have come on this trip, except that he had a hidden matter of the Tower of the Spurned to attend to. Once on the surface, the Harvest did scout the city, to learn what it needed to know for future endeavors. After some time, and the extermination of several wandering sentries, the Harvest found itself by the docks. As they discussed their further plans, Tzlar judged his place in the city, and his vicinity to where he needed to be. He needed to draw the attention of one particular member of the Wizard’s guild. While he engaged her, the other agents of the Tower would be able to obtain their objective. But first Tzlar needed to draw off the guardian of the object. Then, as if Solusek Ro himself had intervened on his behalf, the Wizardress appeared at the docks.<br>
<br>
Her eyes narrowing in anger she said, “We knew one of you would come to steal the Artifact, knew it was a matter of time. Now Dark One you shall pay for your evil folly”. Tzlar merely snorted in disgust and stood straight in arrogant defiance. Tzlar knew she was more powerful then him, knew he faced her on her home ground. As the other members of the Harvest rallied to the attack, Tzlar knew it was hopeless, knew they would all be defeated. He felt no guilt or sorrow for the sacrifice of his fellow guild members though. This was a matter of the Arcane, and for the Art all were expendable, even those who were his closest allies. Besides, it was their honor to die in the service of the Empire, whether they wanted to or not. He need not win this battle, only survive for a long enough time. Drawing a small enchanted glass rod from one of the many pockets of his robe, Tzlar spoke the magical trigger and snapped the rod in half. Thus, had the signal been given to those hidden nearby. As the battle raged, the members of the Violent Harvest fell to the tremendous magics of the female Wizard. True to their honor, they did not flinch or run, but stood and fought till their tragic end. At last, only Tzlar and the Wizardress stood facing each other. They both cast their spells and, as Tzlar was struck down, the last thing he heard was a magical voice in his head saying one word…”Success”. Thus, while the guardian was off slaying her enemy, did her enemy achieve victory over her and all the other sub-races of Norrath.   <br>
