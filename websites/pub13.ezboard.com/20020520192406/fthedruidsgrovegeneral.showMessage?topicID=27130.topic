Gives more flexibility/options/power.<br><br>Also, it is easier to say &quot;Any druid who has obtained item X is likely in this echelon, therefor item X will be given focus ability Y, instantly improving all druids with item X&quot;, than to tell all the druids &quot;You have to get the rare spell drop Q off mob Z to become effective, the fact that you would likely have spell Q if we had thought to add it sooner is irrelevant, your previous work means nothing to us&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxicantempestwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xican TempestWolf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/14/02 9:16:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27130.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Weeeee.</span><hr size=1> Without pain, it's not really 'healing' though, then is it?  =P <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63622">Xican's profile</a><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=108458">Ashen's Profile</a><BR><i>It's better to swallow blood than pride.</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufiremynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Firemynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/15/02 5:40:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27130.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weeeee.</span><hr size=1> People keep talking about AoE dmg from dragons and such.

It would be a &quot;heal&quot; in the same way that shammie slows are considered &quot;heals&quot; (eg dmg prevention rather than dmg cures), so it shouldn't step on cleric toes.<br><br>It would also fit right in with our role as fire/cold buff/debuff.  If I'm understanding this correctly, it would be something like a chanter rune spell, only for cold/fire based stuff?<br><br>Sounds like a wonderful compromise to me. <p>Jinjre Meadowdancer<BR>Dancing in meadows since April 22nd, 1999<BR><BR>Money can't buy you happiness, but it can make you more comfortably miserable.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unabopolasser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nabopolasser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/15/02 10:44:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27130.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Weeeee.</span><hr size=1> The problem with simply an AoE resist only line is that as Verant gets more and more &quot;clever&quot; with their end encounters, you are going to run into mobs with AoE physical attacks, etc.<br><br>I fully support, love, endorse, etc., the idea of a druid being able to save the life of myself and others on a raid.
