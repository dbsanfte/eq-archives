Why? I find myself so irritated that I have to get this &quot;magic number&quot; just to be apart of something I think would be fun and entertaining. <br><br>I can remember back in Dec 1999 when I started my Erudite Wizard and I joined Azure Sky. I was in the teens level I think. The reason I joined was because I had a real life friend in it. Back then, I wasn't really aware of any guilds that had the minimum level requirement. Of course, to be honest, I wasn't really looking for a new guild. There might of been but that's not my point.<br><br>Am I then considered a inexperienced player because I am under level 35? I think so many guilds are missing out on some great friends and possible great guild officers/members when they reject them because of their level. I do like how some guilds invite me to talk to other members and group with them. But um, I do that anyways! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>I just feel like I am being labeled &quot;incompetent&quot; and not worthy enough. But it is their guild, who ever it is. This is just my opinion and I have never been a guild leader so maybe this is installed because of certain reasons. Correct me if I am wrong but I think they just don't want a lot of people in their guild that are &quot;useless&quot; to them. Or perhaps they see other guilds doing it so they just adopt it without fully considering the repercussions.<br><br>What do you think? Am I totally wrong? Do I have a point?<br><br>P.S. No where in this post did I mean to offend or discourage people from joining guilds. My main purpose for this post was to make guild leaders/officers think about this and to see it from a lower level person's point of view. I doubt any change with come out of it.<br><br>-Sanwise <p>Sanwise</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukralthan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kralthan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/18/02 4:23:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about guilds</span><hr size=1> It really depends on what you are looking for in a Guild.  Your typical &quot;Uberguild&quot; only cares about 2 things.  Raids and phat lewt.  If you arent lvl 60, then you arent going to be much use to them as they run around the world trying to FCFS each other on Gods, Dragons, and anything else that drops something the rest of the server drools over.  If you want planar armor, you need raid numbers all above lvl 47.  If you wanna kill Gods and the like, you need 5 or 6 teams of people 55-60.  So the &quot;uberguilds&quot; dont care about you until you are in their raid size.<br><br>If your looking for cool people to hang out with, talk to, and level up with size isnt as big of an issue.  But the smaller Guilds who dont require huge lvl requirements never get to kill Gods or raid planes.  So they tend to lose their high lvl players to the guilds that are doing this.<br><br>My Guild is a good example of this ... we dont have a huge minimal lvl requirement.  We only ask the character be lvl 10 or better, so that we know the person is satisfied with the class and will play the character.  But we dont raid the planes every day.  We havent killed a God yet, and our number of Dragons killed is pretty small.  And 85% of our member who hit lvl 50+ within the last year left. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uacinotna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acinotna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/19/02 2:41:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about guilds</span><hr size=1> EXCELLENT question.   The reason Protectors of The Balance requests 30+ is for a few reasons.  One is because we (and myself) have loved a char till 30 and has become boring at that point (because of whatever reason).  Thsi shows you are actaully interested and enjoy your character.  The other reason is becasue when people have a "main" that is lower or around that level, they are VERY inexperinced in ways of agro management, pulling, assisting etc.  I for one LOVE teaching these things.  But when you have someone lower in level (and it goes back to point one,) they seem to get too discouraged and start a new char.  Another reason is becasue this guild does do raids that are in the 30's+ area.  Most of the 30's raids are more to get people used to raiding and how we do it.<br><br>Yes, we are missing out on some nice and good people, but at the same time we(as a guild) are having the good and nice people that can actually stick with a character, which is what all guilds really want.<br><br>When it comes to joining Guilds, it's not just what you are looking for but at the same time, what the guild is looking for as well.  If both of these are not teh same, then someone is leaving.<br><br>We have not done Planes yet(stll need more people i the 46+ range) but we did take VS down Thursday with 17 people, so it's all what you tre looking for and the guild is looking for.<br><br> <p><img src=http://users.erols.com/acsinva/Ace1.JPG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umistovan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>mistovan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://angelfire.lycos.com/images/images3/lightnin.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/22/02 12:05:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://revelers.itgo.com/ppic3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about guilds</span><hr size=1> Excellent question and superior responses!!<br><br>In the Revelers, we ask a minimum of 25 for the most part because it is relatively easy to attain and gives you time to get really familiar with your character. Also, by that time, you will have established a reputation for yourself and we are looking for people that will fit in with our easy-going ways.<br><br>Our guild is attempting to grow into a raid capable size over time. Our planes capable members want to be able to do the big stuff, but we are working at patiently helping our folks to grow to our level ranges so that we can breach those challenges. <br><br>One thing that we are doing as well is making exceptions to the minimum requirement. If one of our members knows someone in RL or has grouped with a person often and has glowing words of praise for them, the minimum can be waived to keep from missing out on the company of these quality individuals.<br><br>Good hunting to all. <p><center> <img src="http://revelers.itgo.com/EQRevelSig.jpg"> </center> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaquilaswiftspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aquila Swiftspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/27/02 11:26:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.harmonyofsouls.org/pics/hosicon_flag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question about guilds</span><hr size=1> I think guilds with most members 50+ that like to exp group together as well as raid together find that folks much lower level get frustrated at never being able to join in guild activities.  In some cases, then the guild may actually be considering its lack of ability to provide a range of exp group, raid, and fun in the level range, and may feel that people in that range are more likely to be unhappy.<br><br>If you're in your 20s, for example, you should get to go be terrified in tough zones, learn them, gain confidence in them.  A guild with most people 50 or so can't help you with that.<br><br>Unhappy people in a guild can adversely affect the guild all the way around.<br><br>Finally, most guilds gain new members through folks the members get to know experiencing, raiding, and cooperating on camps.  Most guilds like to get to know folks before they become members.  A large difference in levels makes this familiarity very difficult, as you won't be hanging around in the same area very often.  <br><br>At 35 or so, a char can gain exp in a group with 50+ people, so that makes a logical minimum for some guilds. <p><center><img src="http://spin.emich.edu/sig/aq4.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showPrevMessage?topicID=303.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showNextMessage?topicID=303.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=303.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.threadControl?topicID=303.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=303.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=303.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home<option value="prexus95980frm22">Neverwinter Nights</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980guildrecruiting>Guild Recruiting</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script --><div align="center"><script language="javascript"> document.write(adbottom); </script></div><!-- End BOTTOM AD Script --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
