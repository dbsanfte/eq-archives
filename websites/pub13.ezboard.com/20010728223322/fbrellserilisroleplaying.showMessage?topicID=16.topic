I find my connection to this place troubled more as of late and so I have been distant, and my mind does strange things. Lyrics come to me now:<br>
<br>
Fairblade is Raining while<br>
Baen'Blade rumbles<br>
<br>
Darkwind is Silent while<br>
Darkwind has minions<br>
<br>
Spiritslammer is Legion while<br>
Thundercat cries out HO!<br>
<br>
D'Estain brings death while<br>
D'Insidious charms the rest<br>
<br>
Crimsonfist rallies the Legion while<br>
Drinkingfist lies down in a dress<br>
<br>
Hand me some more of the rabbit, the day is cold out indeed. But the tales we spin warm the soul. Let the Skalds continue with their song and let the tales live on.<br>
<br>
Ulver Stonemace<br>
Legion of Heroes<br>

P.S. I have been having trouble getting online lately IRL so I haven't been on as much. This is being addressed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uhumwawa.showPublicProfile>Humwawa</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of Brell</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(3/27/00 9:35:22 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   A song and a death</span><hr size=1> The two men sit near a fire, one noticeably cold, the other feeling nothing except the heat of a breathing being close, with life still flowing through his veins.  Both friends.<br>
<br>
The Kithicor is dark with the shades of evening: a sign to most that it is time to retire home.  These two have no home.  The campfire is their resting place, and it always a brief one for an adventurer.  Still they sing songs to eachother to pass the time.<br>
<br>
Ulver finishes his song, his rough highland tones shaking thunder from the skies as he sings of his friends.  The D`Estain remains silent all the while, a small smile playing upon his indigo skin -- a rare sight.  Humwawa stands, wrapping his black robes around him, with firelight burning like lust or rage in his crimson eyes.  He opens his lips and breathes deeply of the night air, and remembers when it was necessary for him to do so.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I will sing you a song now, Stonemace.  But it is not my voice you will hear.&quot;<br>
<br>
The D`Estain's eyes roll back into their sockets, and the wind rises through the trees of the Kithicor.  He chants softly, barely audible under the roaring winds.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I hear the souls of a thousand men crying here,<br>
   Enslaved my the Prince of Hate: Innoruuk, the Father.<br>
   I hear the cries of the ravens of war, their beaks smeared with blood,<br>
   And I hear no more.<br>
   I hear the steps of a man in black, revultant.<br>
   His will a blade -- his touch, poison.<br>
   I hear those I joined with for a time, to slay<br>
   And break asunder the lives of many.<br>
   Their heroism shall be immortalized in song,<br>
   As will my villainy.<br>
   I hear their songs, then I hear no more.<br>
   The Walker has stopped walking, and Dawn rises before me:<br>
   Dosoloth has come.&quot;<br>
<br>
Humwawa looks down upon Ulver, a soft smile contorting his face.  He turns to the darkness of the Kithicor, away from the fire and speaks softly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;He's here, Ulver.  He's come for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He sighs.<br>
<br>
  &quot;And I am glad of it, my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
The D`Estain speaks still softly, yet louder than before, and the howling of rabid angels lingers in the depths of his voice.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I hear you, young one.  I taste the scent of you, as I have consumed your being once, in the darkness of the Fens of Innothule so long ago.  And I know why you are here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ulver rises, the storm that is his strength blazing around him, a thundercloud of palpable will.  The D`Estain raises his hand, a gesture to calm his friend, and before them a man stands, obviously Teir`Dal from the style of his midnight armour, a drawn blade in his left hand.  Humwawa spreads his arms wide, black robes drawn out as the wings of a raven.  The knight moves as a serpent, his body fluid, envenomed, and hungry.  The cruel blade tears forward.  Humwawa falls.<br>
<br>
The woods return to their silence: the wind has fallen down.  Ulver speaks a few words of healing, but they are wasted upon dead flesh.  The knight wipes his blade upon the dark, bloody robes shrouding the fallen man, sheathes it, and removes his helm.  His face is sharp-featured, his cheeks like razors on his face, his jaw stark and bladed in its angularity.  He is young -- not yet in his twenties, but his pale blue blaze with an ire far exceeding his years.  His face twists into a contorted smile, diseased and rotten with corruption, and he looks upon Ulver.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps&quot;, he said quietly, &quot;Perhaps his burning touch lacked its fire just once.  And perhaps his touch was....not as thorough as it should have been.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dosoloth's smile grows wider.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps he showed me how it should burn, and how to use it, by turning his touch upon a young man walking the fens in search of vengeance for his people&quot;<br>
<br>
He spits in the direction of the fallen man, and walks away, his fading form emanating a palpable aura of fury that has been finally appeased but has yet to be consumed.<br>
<br>
Ulver sits alone by the fire, his hands clenched in fury.  Yet he knows that any action he could have attempted to prevent his friend's death would have been disastrous.  His ancestor spirits had whispered their wisdom to him: &quot;Let this pass.&quot;<br>
<br>
The black-robe loses all of its texture, fading from cloth to shadows, and sinks into the soil.  Humwawa's body is gone.<br>
<br>
A cold, steel-gloved hand falls upon Ulver's shoulder.  He starts, then composes himself.  He feels hot breath upon the back of his neck, and Dosoloth's voice whispers quietly to him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Know that all actions are to the satisfaction of the Fates, and that you and I will be allies, perhaps friends along this road we both walk.  Hate me now, sir: it appeases the Father&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ravens sing behind Ulver, and the furtive flailings of a murder of ravens' wings cut the silence.  Dosoloth is gone.<br>
<br>
--The D`Estain<br>
<br>
PS Yup.  Humwawa is now retired.  Kilmarny Dosoloth takes his place.  I hope you enjoy him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=14.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=6.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
