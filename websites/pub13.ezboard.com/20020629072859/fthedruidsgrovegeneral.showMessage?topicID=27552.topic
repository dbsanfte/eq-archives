Please look into this.<br><br>Secondly, please recall that most damaging spells are balanced with a player harming an npc with npc level hps in mind. An npc casting these spells on a player is doing damage that is a much larger percentage of the target's hps than when a player is casting on an npc. There is a reason that spells are &quot;nerfed&quot; in pvp combat. Please consider reducing the damage that npc spells do to players in a manner similar to the way they are balanced in pvp.<br><br>Third, the price that players pay for being able to cast spells is in hitpoints, armor class, lack of melee ability, and a limited mana pool. While npc casters have a somewhat limited manapool, most don't seem to have any of the other disadvantages that pcs pay to be casters, thus making them essentially warriors who cast. I would ask that you consider scaling down the hitpoints or melee ability of casting mobs, as an npc who can cast for 1200dmg and hits for 250 just like the non-casting warrior npcs in the same dungeon, is over-powered.<br><br>Thanks<br><br><br>Actually, that’s a ‘sort-of-a-bug’ thing… Because NPCs were so stupid about casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities to make them relatively better casters. Some of those casters might be too good now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis.<br><br>Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their ‘level’, and special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate. Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.<br><br>We’re not forgetting any of those things: we know NPCs have relatively more hit points than PCs, we know they do more damage… we know that stuff.<br><br>You have to keep in mind that these NPCs, though smarter, still don’t have the advantages of being played by human beings. The players get to pick the odds for the most part, they get to pick the timing of the fight and they get to choose from a wide arsenal of classes, spells, items, abilities etc. And a human can put all that stuff together in ways that even our AI code can’t (though I’d love to see NPCs splitting PC spawns.  ).<br><br>That’s the price that NPCs pay, and it’s a pretty big one.<br><br>But we’re keeping our eyes on it, playing against these nifty NPCs ourselves and all that. We’ll make further changes as needed.<br><br>Alan<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I thought this was a well written from Ghanimaa but Alans responce was very disturbing.

In recent history, the first time The Grey was nerfed, the changes were too strong, and they went back and toned it down. The Siren's Grotto entrance was something of an issue once, and that was changed; inside, the zone was too "difficult" and changes were made. Velketor's Labyrinth was once a rather deserted zone due to the overpowered "greens." <br><br>I don't know if this mob tuning will make druids more desirable in dungeon-crawling groups, but it would seem possible for xping. Like I said elsewhere, xping was about the most boring, safe, predictable, and mind-numbing experience next to farming greens for tradeskills -- a lot of people could go afk during xp groups and not worry about it -- but yes, it is not fair that -60 wizard mobs cast Sunstrike, Garrison's, or Elnerick's on you. It's also pretty overpowering for caster mobs to melee like champs (it's nothing new). All in all, some change was needed to make fights harder, but some of the changes were overtuned. :) <p><center><img src="http://www.cityviewsoftware.com/jennifer/forest2.jpg"><br><font size=1>G&nbsp;w&nbsp;y&nbsp;n&nbsp;h&nbsp;y&nbsp;f&nbsp;a&nbsp;r&nbsp;&nbsp;F&nbsp;o&nbsp;x&nbsp;f&nbsp;y&nbsp;r&nbsp;e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hierophant&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;absentia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;o&nbsp;l&nbsp;u&nbsp;s&nbsp;e&nbsp;k&nbsp;&nbsp;R&nbsp;o</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useriena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seriena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/7/02 7:51:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27552.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: VI new responce to NPC high end casters</span><hr size=1> Didn't you know that caster balancing meant NPC caster balancing?

Some of the changes are a bit overboard and need to be toned down but over all I don't think players can complain to much.<br><br>What I think it means for druids though is an even harder time finding groups since people still aren't going to say "We're going to OS, better bring a druid for CoS!".

The Holy Trinity just got stronger imo.

Need 5 pallies.<br><br>Alan is rationalizing a BAD THING and not doing a very good job of it. Not at all.<br><br>Granted, NPC casters didn't always choose their attack spells sensibly. Their &quot;AI&quot; was a combination of randomization and pre-selection (small lineup of spells assigned to them by designers, to make sure they didn't randomly spawn with nothing but utility spells from their 'class' e.g. enduring breath, which NPCs don't need anyway).<br><br>Each NPC spawned with any/all of the following: a pre-selected set of buffs already active; pre-selected set of spells with which to buff themselves and other nearby NPCs; and pre-selected set of attack and debuff spells to use against player characters. <br><br>But NPC casters were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  already</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> &quot;balanced&quot; by virtue of the fact that they:<br>- have as many hit points as NPC melee classed counteparts, <br>- melee as well as NPC melee classed counterparts,<br>- have resistances that were as good or better than NPC melee classed counterparts,<br>And they:<br>- have channeling skill suspiciously far above PC casters can ever achieve,<br>- have the odd ability to instantly regenerate hundreds or even thousands of hit points after a successful gate_spell to their spawn point.<br>- have innate RunSpeed3 long before level 51.<br><br>I dare say that if player casters had the first two advantages NPC casters have in the list above, they'd never again mention caster balancing with the degree of desperation you've seen since Velious. But we haven't asked for the same combat and health as melee classes, because we realize those are the disadvantages to having magical abilities. Unfortunately that principle has been so utterly abandoned for NPC casters, that player casters are at an unfair disadvantage.<br><br>Alan:<br><br>You state that player casters have the &quot;advantage&quot; of being controlled by human beings. I have to ask you -- what good does that advantage do player casters when 1 or 2 nukes from a blue-con NPC can wipe out a PC caster's entire health bar in less time than a heal can be cast on them?<br><br>We're not just talking about a planned encounter where the caster is with a raiding party which has buffed and prepared for a big battle; we're talking about a caster who gets jumped by an NPC caster that spawns on top of them while they're simply trying to get from point A to point B in a regular hunting zone.<br><br>You want case-by-case? Okay in Maiden's Eye, take a goranga spiritseer for example. This is a non-named, regular-exp, regular-spawn NPC in Maiden ... which happens to nuke for 800-900 damage, and chain nukes. Now tell me, if a 60th level shadowknight with over 1400 armor class and 140+ MR gets nuked by that mob for over 800 damage per hit, how long is a 55th level pure caster going to last against that mob?<br><br>Bad AI is always going to be a poor excuse, considering AI is the basis for NPC encounters in this type of game. The designers could easily choose a better set of spells for NPC casters to have at their disposal commensurate to level, and the designers could easily add a more sensible specific order in which spells would be cast during an encounter, and could easily add more sensible NPC caster responses to situational variables. <br><br>Instead, they take the easy way out, and artificially enhance the casting ability of NPC mobs beyond the proportion of their actual levels.<br><br>Maybe those same designers should be placed in charge of player caster balancing.<br><br>/shrug<br><br>~Firemynd <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufiremynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Firemynd</A> at: 6/7/02 8:28:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufiremynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Firemynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/7/02 11:33:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27552.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladins and wizards &gt; Druids</span><hr size=1> /ooc <br>By the way, if you're using Internet Explorer, you can right-click that screen shot and Zoom Out, to bring the page to a more comfortable reading width.

In most high level dungeons, the mobs were casting spells 30 levels below them and usually stuck to 1 or 2 of their arsenal of spells.  They were casting slows on non-melee players, and casting pets when they should have been nuking, etc.<br><br>So, in one respect, I think Verant had the right idea.  Unfortunately, they over-reacted of course.  NPCs should only cast spells appropriate to their level - I don't care what Alan says.  They already have the HP advantage, massive channeling advantage and mana pool advantage over players.  Let's not have level 55 mobs casting 60 spells in addition to that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Plus, you take into account that resists in EQ don't really work that well most of the time and it's really really tough to resist a caster spell.
