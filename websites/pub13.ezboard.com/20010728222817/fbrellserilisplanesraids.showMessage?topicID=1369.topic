Now being Hate/Fear are reserved it limits me to going about once every 3 weeks to a month.  What I've been thinking is taking some of these friends from smaller guilds on a raid to PoG.  Nothing big just 3-4 hours tops.  Just kinda pop in for a few hours kill a few things to have fun and a large raiding experience and maybe get a few items for someone (even though thats not the motivation).  If you could answer a few questions I'd appreciate it:<br>
<br>
1) What is the minimum amount of level 46-52 players that you recommend?<br>
<br>
2) How many mobs are able to be taken down by, say, 12 to 18 level 46-52 players?<br>
<br>
3) What portion of the zone are these mobs in and what are they?<br>
<br>
4) What kind of tactics, other than what you would use on Fear/Hate type mobs, would we need to know?<br>
<br>
5) Whats the deal with the Protectors of Growth?<br>
<br>
Thanks.   I'm hoping to take 12 people (lvl 50 average) into PoG for a few hours sometime and just want to have a feel for what to expect.  <p>Twiggie Tymberwolf

First time you get 2 pog (Protector's of Growth) your in for trouble without some more robust tanks.  Protectors have a good level range around 54ish I think, can't be mezzed, and high MR.  They are very annoying little bastards.  They also have a zone wide agro, so once they pop they are coming for you.<br>
<br>
Pull group does more kiting then mezzing.<br>
<br>
My raid crew to PoG: 18-24 People<br>
Min: 50+, have an average crew around level 55.<br>
West Side of Stream: Constant Killing as long as pull can keep up.  Very easy.<br>
East Side of Stream: Dealing with mostly lv55-60 mobs.  Pulling slows down some with a raid crew of 20ish.  Raid crew between 46-52 will get stomped eventually.<br>
Bring a Rez-Stick with you.  <br>

Come scout for us sometime Twiggie, will give you an idea of whats going on. <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>  Posts: 1816<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/15/01 5:56:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/itsme.jpg height=153 width=142></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Nillon, Maya, anyone that knows a bit on PoG...</span><hr size=1> well 6 level 55 can do it just fine, with level 50s i'd take 18 or so.

Not really looking to even go far in.  Just figured it would be fun for those friends of mine that don't get picked to go on raids and such.  Just killing the west side stuff is what I was looking for.  Really didn't intend on putting much of a dent in the zone.   Was more for the planar raid experience for them than anything.   If we get a few drops great but mostly just looking for a few hours of something new.<br>
<br>
Are the PoGs similar in difficulty (other than the agro) as Thought Destroyers in Hate?<br>
<br>
Most of the tanks I would be taking are in the 51 to 55 range but the casters and such are the ones in the 47 to 50 range.<br>
<br>
I'd love to come scout for you.   <p>Twiggie Tymberwolf

<br>
From experience, I can say <br>
<br>
1) The POGs are AT LEAST as fast as a 59th level druid with SOW, but they aren't that much FASTER.  The problem comes with them casting.  Since they are so fast, its very hard to oval.  You sort of have to &quot;square&quot; kite them to prevent them from cutting you off on your turns.  I couldn't honestly tell you whether they're slightly faster, or they're the same speed.  But I can tell you definitively that they are no <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> slower</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than SOW.<br>
<br>
2) Tenil would have to confirm this BUT...I think he snared one after multiple attempts.  It was, if I'm not mistaken, however, a classic case of &quot;too little, too late.&quot;  If they do snare, they sure don't snare easy. <p><BR>

<br>
PoGs do NOT out run sow OR Jboots.  Dulcineia was kiting them for a long time during our first CR using Jboots.  She would actually gain ground on them even when they didn't stop to cast.   Using Form of the Great Wolf I could easily catch up to them and even her.  You can oval kite them as long as they are close to you.  Problem is when you get ahead of them a bit from being a bit faster and take the turn before they start to turn and they cut you off.   From following them around I would say they run just as fast as any other fast mob.<br>
<br>
Now the tranquil treant WAS faster than the PoGs but NOT as fast as Jboots or Wolf form but alot closer.  She barely gained any ground on the treant but the treant seemed to want to stop and cast debuffs and dots on her alot so she stayed ahead of it fairly easy.<br>

<br>
They also do not out run SoW, as the only way I was able to snare it was to get some room to cast.<br>
<br>
Im glad I didnt read that they couldnt be snared before I tried it myself, because with my weak hp and AC is I believed that they ran faster than SoW and couldnt be snared there is no way I would of tried to kite the bastids for CR.<br>

I am beggining to wonder if they are naturally just slower than Jboots.  I'm guessing that when they spawn and a KoS player is in the zone they IMMEDIATELY go for the player without buffing themselves but at other times when the zone is empty of KoS players they buff themselves with SoW making them faster.  That could explain how we have different people seeing different things.<br>
<br>
I followed them every time they spawned and came straight at us. They weren't faster than Jboots. I didn't follow them around during plane break when they had been up a while so I'm not sure how fast they were.    <p>Twiggie Tymberwolf
