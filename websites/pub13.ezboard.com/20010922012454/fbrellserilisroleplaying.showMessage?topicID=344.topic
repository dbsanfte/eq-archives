The rogues knew something was up, but they needed more information.  They hated to do it, but the bard was the perfect choice to scout as she could move faster than any of them and had enough skill to move quietly.<br>
<br>
She watched closely during the days and read histories at night.  The bard was trying to find a reason to stop the fear in her heart.  Except for the one man that warmed her heart she could let no others get physically close without fear causing her mind to race.  As a bard she could let no emotion go unchecked as it influenced her music too much, so she must learn to control it.  They way she figured to do that was to put a face to the danger and an explanation to the emotion.<br>
<br>
Kestri put face to the guards and people that visited the guilds, reported them carefully to the rogues but what began to intrigue her was the why.  Why were certain ones evil? Why did some worship Fear and Hate?<br>
<br>
As she read the histories she heard of the first shadow knight who killed his brother for a woman and whose soul was taken by the God Innoruk and made his own Knight.  She read the histories of the Teir'dal, Ogre and Troll races, and in these she found understanding of their actions.  Kestri searched for the stories of the lizard race called Iskar but found little information and what she did find was jaded to the3 conquerors, like most history was.  The necromancer’s art frightened her and she could not comprehend the reasoning behind it at all.<br>
<br>
But she grew intrigued by the way that the evil races were treated in this world and found a strange kinship with the ogres, trolls and iskar.  They were not welcomed many places and those who worshiped the Gods of light often looked down upon them.  Listening to the conversations they had she began to understand their speech and made mental notes to help her comprehend.<br>
<br>
She found the Iskar to be very quick witted and quick to anger.  They ate indescribable things and talked of the attempted destruction of their race.<br>
<br>
The ogres seemed the least inclined to hate but quick to hunger for flesh of the smaller races, especially gnomes and halflings.  They seemed to enjoy playing with others and intimidating people, but never to hurt them.<br>
<br>
The trolls seemed to take pleasure in everything and were protective of their friends.  They joked a lot and laughed a lot, and made fun of them selves and others.  Their appetites for the flesh were strong also, but seemed to not be as voracious as the ogres.  She heard the trolls speaking of the beauty of their women and blushed to hear of the activities they shared.  But she couldn't help but compare them talking to those conversations she heard from her own friends.<br>
<br>
But she could not comprehend the Hate and Fear worshipped by the humans.  To her the other races were scorned and they found solace in their makers and Gods, but the humans and dark skinned erudites frightened her more than anything.  She should not comprehend turning from love and light to fear and hatred.  Kestri spent long hours trying to open her heart and see the truth, but she was never able too.  <br>
<br>
Whenever one of these humans came close to her she would have dreams of pain and torture in the evening.  The fear became so great that many nights she would never have slept at all had not a sleeping potion been made available for her.  Then one day in the bard guild she heard a human bard named Sevin talking of the Plane of Hate, where he had killed minions of the God Innoruk and made away with armor specially designed for him.  <br>
<br>
He left the guild and moved to the bank where he began talking to a druid that spoke of the plane of Fear where the God Cazic Thule slept and of the conquests that went there.  The brave adventurers who killed his minions and destroyed the Fear set in their hearts.<br>
<br>
That night Kestri dream of that place and using her skills to kill minions of Hate and donning the armor that would block the Hate and Fear from her soul.  She saw the golden bright armor that spoke of good and armored her from her own dark emotions as well as damage to her body.  <br>
<br>
The next day she sat with Eilisi and told her of her problems and her dreams.  Elisi called forth a shaman to listen to her and advise her as to what they may have meant.  The shaman listened closely and did not need his powers to interpret the meaning for him, he could see the determination her eyes and the armor around her heart with out calling for the Tribunals powers.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Lass, you are now driven.  One day you must venture to these places and do battle with Hate and Fear or you will never find peace in your heart.  The humans that scare you may become your allies someday, but you will never fell comfortable with them as they affect your emotions in too negative of a manner.  So now you must leave Freeport and learn how you may access these places.  Gather your friends to you when you go and use their love and strength to bolster your emotions.  Fight with honor and love and you will succeed.&quot;  He smiled at the small bard the only came up to the middle of his chest.  He leaned forward and kissed her on the top of her head.  <br>
<br>
In that instant they both felt a shock of emotion so strong.  In his mind the Goddess of Love spoke to him, &quot;Chancee you are to be her protector and friend.  Help her to find her way and fight beside her when you can.  I am one of your races creators and by that, I ask of thee to take care of my daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the same instant Kes reeled into a dream state.  Erollisi Marr walked to her and took her hand then led her into gardens.  &quot;My daughter, you have been set on a dangerous path.  It is a lot to ask of one so young, but more forces are at play here than mine.  This barbarian will protect you, and you him, but be gentle with his heart.  From this day forth you will see my children, the barbarians as your friends and strongest allies.  Many among them are strong and will protect you and I choose to leave you in their hands.  Be kind and good and they will stand by you always.  One day I hope that my gift will touch you, and until it does please treat those who look upon you with my eyes as carefully as you can.&quot;  She sat Kestri by a pond in her garden and showed her the lands she should travel to in the pond, she pointed out landmarks and people to look for but one spot she left blank, the point where she would find her Father.  That she wanted the bard to find out all on her own.<br>
