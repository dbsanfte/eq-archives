Frontier Mountians Cycle &quot;Trigger Sweep&quot;<br>
<br>
FM for items. Though there are some nice items here, do we have a plan on acquiring them? May I make a suggestion called the Trigger Sequence or FM Cycle? I will include a little info below for those not familiar with it as well as links to print more inforamtion. <br>

=======================================<br>
<br>
<br>
The &quot;Trigger Sweep&quot; is one of the best areas to get really good loot in a short amount of time.  I promised I wouldn't publish this until I saw it on another board somewhere else.  You will want to do this ASAP, because you know that Verant is going to Nerf this as soon as they can.<br>
<br>
Use the chart to the left to determine which critters to kill and the map on the right to determine areas.  I recommend that you not do this with less than 3 50th level and Up druids, a Chanter with Crack 2, and 2 supporting Charactors.<br>
<br>
We pulled 16 items in 3 hours first night, 32 Items second night in 4 hours, and 20 items the Third night in 3 hours.  Almost all items dropped are lore.<br>

<br>
Here's the skinny: <br>
<br>
I've been hunting the FM area for about two months, and have learned three of the four mob cycles there pretty well. Here are my observations. Please keep in mind that I've never ready any boards (other than this one) on the cyclic spawns, so this is all straight from what I've learned by doing it over and over again, and some of it may be incorrect. <br>
<br>
First, the mobs: <br>
There two basic cycles running in this zone. There's the Sarnak cycle, and the giant/goblin/burynai cycle. I'll break down each here. <br>
<br>
Goblin: <br>
Cheiftan, Iksar Slayer, Blutgin, prospector, Rockwolfe, dustscryer, wandering stone healer, trailblazer, headhunter, herbcollector, a goblin raider (note: regular goblin raiders won't have the &quot;a&quot; in front of their name. They'll just be &quot;goblin raider.&quot; The one you're looking for is &quot;a goblin raider.&quot;). <br>
<br>
Giant: <br>
Krenlek, Gromlok, prospector, Overseer Miklek, Miner Bordakn, Goblinstomper, a mountain giant hillock (you'll know this last because he's much easier than the other giants in the area, and spwans directly after the goblin kill.). <br>
<br>
Burynai: <br>
Burynai treasure seeker, grand cenobite, Bonedigger, Dustback, Gemeye, Eboneyes, squad leader, Stonegrinder, Burynai miner (look for the capital &quot;b&quot; in Burynai for the rare miner. The other miners will be just &quot;a burynai miner&quot; where the rare will be &quot;a Burynai miner.&quot;). <br>
<br>
<br>
Sarnak: <br>
Varithyx, Clazxiss, mystic, goblin coward, warlord, Bloodscale the Vicious, Slithinis, scavenger, rebel, mangy brute, rabid brute, Joojooga, Boogoog, diseased brute, Draketamer (maybe more. This is the hard-to-figure-out part.). <br>
<br>
The Places: <br>
Now that you know what to look for, here's where to go and look. <br>
<br>
Goblin: <br>
Southwest corner. The place you wanna look is at almost exactly the center of the triangle made by the LoIO zone, the southwest corner (almost on top of the Dreadlands zone), and the Mines of Nurga. There is a big mountain, and the goblin pop can be anywhere near the mountain. I haven’t located the exact spot where the gobs spawn simply because I haven’t had the luck to actually be standing in that particular place when they spawn. To get a better understanding of this little verbal diagram, go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/frontiermtnsmap.html">www.eqatlas.com/kunark/fr...nsmap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and check out the map of the zone. There is no easy med spot for this section of nameds: I normally just head up to the very top of a zone wall and be sure to keep camo up. There normally are no giants in the area to see though it. <br>
<br>
The Giants: <br>
Southwest corner. If you're sitting on the roof of the Burning Woods zone, you should be able to track the named giant after the goblin kill. They actually spawn on an outcropping of stone (the zone's floor, normally grass, turns to stone for some reason) at roughly (2000, -3000). They can wander, however, up the large mountain nearby. The safest place to med up nearby is the roof of the Burning Woods zone. No wandering mobs to contend with. <br>
<br>
The Burynai: <br>
Northwest corner. This is the hardest area, and the Burynai named spawns are the easiest to kill. The area is very mountainous, and there are plenty of pesky giants to see through your camo. The area you're looking for is at roughly (2000, 2000). The Burynai actually spawn in a valley closer to the western wall, but roam more towards the middle of the zone, ie. into the mountains. This area can be tough simply because you can't see the giants before they're on top of you. The mountains give them cover. I've only had one death in this zone, and it was in this area. The closest available clear med spot that i've been able to find is the Overthere shelf... the tunnel that leads to that zone. No mobs that I've seen roam around up there. <br>
<br>
Sarnak: <br>
All over. All the rare brutes (which are a part of the Sarnak cycle: it's how you get the Sarnaks themselves to spawn), are in the SW corner. All the Sarnaks, however, are up in the NW corner, just south of the Burynai spawnpoint. This is the cycle that I'm not yet sure about. I've seen the named sarnaks up, as well as the rare brutes, and I kill them everychance I get, but I haven't been able to spot the pattern in it. It's close, though... I feel it burning, like a lash caught in your eye. <br>
<br>
Order: <br>
When starting out the cycle for the night, I just run to every spawn point, and kill the first rare I see to give me some kind of cohesive idea on where to start. The order goes like this: <br>
<br>
Burynai (NW corner) <br>
Goblin (SE corner) <br>
Giant (SW corner). <br>
<br>
As soon as you kill Dustback in the NW corner, the headhunter pops in the SE corner. As soon as he drops, Goblinstomper pops in the giant area in the SW corner. Dig? <br>
<br>
The order that I presented there isn't actually the order they'll spawn in; that's just an example. I don't think there is a pattern to which named spawn in each area. If there is one, I don't see it yet. The only certain thing is that you will see a goblin rare after a burynai rare, a giant rare after a goblin rare, and a burynai rare after a goblin rare. <br>
<br>
As I've said, I havn't found a pattern to the Sarnak cycle yet. However, I haven't read any of the boards on this (fine, fine) site, or any other. All this stuff is based on my observation. <br>
<br>
Strategy: <br>
<br>
Goblin: <br>
Kill them fast. =) That's basically it. The Iksar Slayer is a necro, so watch for that dot that reverses sow (clinging darkness?). The Cheiftan and herbcollector hit like a truck, so root and plink/nuke, if you've got the juice. The wandering stone healer does in fact heal himself, albeit with shaman heals, and casts shamanic spells. The main thing to think about with gobs is to get them off that damned mountain. The z axis messes up the range of melee weaponry, and there's always the chance of levitate wearing thin at the wrong time. <br>
<br>
Giant: <br>
Root and plink/nuke. That's about all you can do with these fellows. None of them cast to my knowledge, and all of them have mass hitpoints compared with the other rare types. The two hardest to kill are Miner Bordakn and Overseer Miklik. Take them out like you would with any giant: at range. Remeber, snare after you root. The two spells do stack now. Other giants will agro in this area, so pull them to the most open place you can find. <br>
<br>
Burynai: <br>
These guys are cake, unless you're lucky enough to have the Grand Cenobyte spawn. All of them can be killed straight melee with snare only with a minimum loss of life. The Grand Cenobyte does heal himself, and casts smite, as any good cleric does when he's in deep. Again, the main thing to remember about this area, the NW corner, is that it's very very mountainous, and the giants seem to come out of nowhere. Also, of note, burynai cenobytes that are just cruising by will heal your kill when he's low. Try pulling the burynai rares to any valley in the area. That should work... always has for me. <br>
<br>
Sarnak: <br>
These guys are the hardest kills of the rares, and are in the easiest areas. The brutes in the cycle are in the SW corner with the gobs. Snare and fall them. Super easy kills. The Sarnaks are a different story. They're the hardest rares, but are still in a managable area. I believe Bloodscale the Vicious is the hardest hostile mob in the zone, so be ready for a tough fight. They all hit hard, move fast, and have wicked regen times. The only strategy that I could find for the harder ones (Bloodscale, warlord) is to snare pull them to the Temple of Droga zone, and let the goblins there eat away at them. The Sarnaks will kill all the gobs there one by one, but will be at least half dead when they finally get through. This seems like cheating, but I'm not inclined to count it as an exploit. The only Sarnak I've personally had to pull over there was Bloodscale. He's tough at level 45 or so. Still yellow to me, but managable: the only buff I had that didn't come out of my bag of tricks was clarity. <br>
<br>
Drops: <br>
Here's what each rare set drops. <br>
<br>
Goblin: <br>
Headhunter - Spear (vendor fodder) <br>
Chieftan - Chieftan's Headdress <br>
Herbcollector - Junta Scythe (vendor fodder) <br>
Dustscryer - Dustscryer's Ball (range,+int) <br>
Blutgin - Medicine Totem (range, +wis) <br>
Wandering S. Healer - Goblin Soul Caller (+wis, cleric) <br>
Trailblazer - Trailblazer's dagger (vendor fodder) <br>
The rest are plat only, if I remember correctly. <br>
<br>
<br>
Giant: <br>
Overseer Miklek - Gem Encrusted Circlet (+int, wrist) <br>
Miner Bordakn - Plat and gems, some rare. <br>
Krenlek - Skullhelm of Krenlek (decent headware) <br>
Gromlok - Gromloks Basher (fun 2hb, war/shd) <br>
<br>
Some other stuff. I think all the giants have rare drops, and I don't think I've seen nearly all of them. <br>
<br>
<br>
Burynai: <br>
Dustback - Dusty Breastplate (plate bp, 22ac) <br>
Grand Cenobite - Belt of the Cenobite (+wis, small chain/plate) <br>
Gemeye - Gem Finder (vendor fodder) <br>
Eboneyes - Ebon Razor (9/25, saves) <br>
Stonegrinder - Stone Thunder (hammer, vendor fodder) <br>
Squad Leader - rusty mining pick (let it rot) <br>
<br>
<br>
Sarnak: <br>
Varithyx - Sleeves of the Ancients (nodrop, good ac, cha, str) <br>
Slithinis - shield (vendor fodder) <br>
Bloodscale the Viscious - Blood Splattered Veil <br>
Clazxis - Windetched Staff (nice proc, bad ratio) <br>
rebel - Necklace of Defiance (8ac, neck) <br>
<br>
The rest of the Sarnaks have rares, I think, but these are the only ones I've seen with my own eyes. <br>
<br>
<br>
One last bit: <br>
<br>
There are other named/weird mobs in the zone, but to my knowledge don't have anything to do with these cyclic mobs. These are: <br>
<br>
a goblin legate - (nasty cleric) <br>
a goblin adept <br>
Snaorf - Burynai (Iksar war. quest, underground) <br>
Eldak Howlingbear - nonhostile giant <br>
Mentrax Mountainbone - nonhostile giant <br>
<br>
There's also a high elf that's standing in the bindabe circle that has nothing to do with the cyclic mobs. His name begins with an &quot;F,&quot; and is something like Finlan. I just can't remember it for the life of me. <br>
<br>
Advice: <br>
Stay out in the open, keep levitate on, and always re-camo yourself immediately after you loot the bad guy you just killed. Also remember, if you play in quarter-screen first-person, you can hit &quot;i&quot; on your keyboard (inventory hotkey) and check what's behind you in the little window. This is the reason why I do the cycle in that crappy little quarter-screen mode. Always keep root up, and make sure you aren't eight miles high when levitate decides it needs to wear off. Don't take on a giant unless you're sure that you can take him. <br>
<br>
And above all, enjoy yourself. This is a great place to make some cash, and if you're smart about it, a spot of experience. I work with two other rangers most of the time in this zone. Thanks Anayana and Weneras of the Keepers of the Fiery Myste for showing my how things are done. =) <br>
