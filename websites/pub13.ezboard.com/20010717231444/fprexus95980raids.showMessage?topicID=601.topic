<br>
Number one, Plane of growth hasnt been put on a reserved rotation yet.  This means noone is gonna check to see if you have it reserved, thats like trying to reserve a seat at McDonalds.  They dont take reservations.<br>
<br>
Number two, if you knew anything about that Plane, you would know that it can easily support 2 or 3 guild raids at once.  I was there myself for 10 hours, we cleared about 30% of the plane, and by the time i left there was respawn.  We had killed maybe 3 rare guys, and at least 10 or 12 were left in the zone for anyone to come in and get.  That place is HUGE, and we didnt tell you to get the hell outta the plane.  We simply asked the people that showed up not to hang right around us, its dangerous if you cant hear our guildchat (to hear incomings, camp, etc) and we dont wanna be wiped out by people just hanging aorund the camp.<br>
<br>
Number three, like i stated above, if you had talked to any of us instead of seeing us in growth and coming to post this, you would have known that sharing that zone is possible, and we could have worked something out.  Instead you were quick to pull out the flamethrower, which not only wasnt deserved, but also demonstrates your unwillingness to share and be cooperative in general.   This is exactly what you are trying to say we did, and it makes you hypocritical.<br>

I also remembe Trana asking me for help to get him out of the zone that nite, and I tried hard to get him out and he eventually did.  So if you guys DO plan a raid, I would think you would try getting EVERYONE out safely, no?  Also I remember Unity not caring for those of you that wanted to stay around with us also.. so wth are you rambling about?  It seems you are the one who is ignorant..

<br>
peopel need to under some stuff here. POG is that big that CAN support multiple raids up there, but how many raids do you know of that people share a zone in? im not talking LGUK or some pharm hole place like that..i am talking a plane. how many times have you shared a plane with another raiding party? you havent. so when people zone in to a plane and see another guild there, they are going to be upset becuase they arent use to sharing. you may know POG is a huge zone, but how many of them know it? after all, SOV just came out and people are still camping mobs 20 to 30 levels below them in hopes of getting that uber drop.<br>
<br>
BTW..not to flame Unity or anything, but those are pretty brave statements that you are saying about Unity and not respecting the boards. when you say you dont read it or care about it, you are saying you dont respect it.<br>
so is this supported guild wide? or is just these people that belong to the guild Unity speaking for themselves?<br>
<br>
i am just curious. if a guild doesnt respect a server wide raid calendar( as much as it is failing, its still there), i think it should come forward and and state it. this goes for any guild on this server. let the leaders of the guild step forward to represent thier guild and state that their guild does not respect the calendar and lets get FFA or FCFS going on this server and see who is Uber in the end.<br>
<br>
tho, we all know what will happen to that.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Phul<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW..yes i do want to hear about all the guilds not respecting the calendar. make a new topic and just state those words. so all of Prexus can see what guilds are FFA and such. that way when some guild is doing a plane raid or a dragon raid or what not, some other guild can come in and take over and noone can come to the board and bitch and moan about how much this guild and that guild sucks because they got thier plane taken away. it doesnt bother me if the server goes FFA, FCFS or if it stays the same. i read the board and sign up for raids i want to go on. its not hard. but i also understand some poeple just arent too bright to understand that.<br>

This was my first raid (running one) and I am in complete awww for the people planning raids.. WHAT A PAIN!<br>
<br>
Unity was correct in that PoG in mamoth... It would easily suppoer 2-3 raids at one time. That is if the server can handle it..<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I offended anyone that night but I messed up and zoned in on accident and couldn't figure out to get out.. Durden was nice enough to come get me and port me to safty later that night..<br>
<br>
So let me just say I am sorry if I pissed anyone off that night and I most def. didn't mean for it to endup up here with people getting upset..<br>

I have done PoG acouple times now and have a good feel for it so the next raid (if the people who sign up show up) will not be so stressful to deal with..<br>
