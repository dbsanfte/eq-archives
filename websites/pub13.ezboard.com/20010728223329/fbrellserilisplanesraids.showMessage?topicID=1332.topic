A Council of Brell (for lack of a better title) to help decide on some of the issues that we've been tossing around.<br>
<br>
Initially I didn't see the point a council would make other than be yet another forum for arguing however something that Justise said made some sense to me. And this was; &quot;We don't have a very good way of implimenting new ideas...&quot; and I think this is very true.<br>
<br>
I noticed that ever since the one vote was initiated by Vumil, now every little thing we are talking about gets called to be voted on. I think it is making people think that the voting criteria is very arbitrary, and thus the voting process is arbitrary.<br>
<br>
Another good point was that why should level 30 players be voting on issues they have no experience on? Not that I want to exclude anyone's opinions on a subject, but a VOTE should be by those that are going to be affected in the present (at least in my opinion).<br>
<br>
So my idea (Mavrin's really) is that we form a council of prominant raid leaders, and guild leaders (basically active people in those areas that are troublesome; i.e. the higher end spots) to decide on what should be a voted topic and what should remain discussion for now. Say 12-24 people that could meet once a week in chat (and/or have their own message board) to talk about any problems or potential problems in a civilized atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Who and how you want to pick people for this council (if anyone thinks this is a viable alternative to the decision making processes we have now) I will leave up to you guys.<br>
<br>
Remember, the idea for this &quot;council&quot; is just to ratify what the council (through general consensus) thinks is an appropriate topic to be voted on, as opposed to the arbitrary voting we have now. They would also be responsible for setting up the rules for voting (level limits, explanations, etc...) on any particular topic.<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?<br>
<br>
P.S. - and no, I do not wish to be part of this &quot;council&quot; should the idea take off, for various reasons. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

<br>
The question is who is going to represent Brell?<br>
<br>
The 24 oldest people? <br>
A random pick of 24 people?<br>
One from each of the 24 most powerful guilds?<br>
Ask people to step up to the task?<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
I can see benefits and downfalls in each area. <br>
<br>
If you randomly pick 24 people, well, you get what you pay for...<br>
<br>
Anyone who would volunteer for the job is either truely passionate about this, or sees a certian degree of power (trust me there is NOTHING like false power to drag politics out into the open. I've seen it in the most innane places).<br>
<br>
The 24 most powerful guilds send a representative? There are many benefits here, but then you have the onus of deciding &quot;powerful&quot; and then identifying the guilds that match that criteria.. <br>
<br>
The oldest people? Age is not necessarily wisdom. Nor is level commesurate with maturity.... One GM stated they had logs of someone leveling a character to 50 in 6 or 7 days (I honestly don't remember)... So going based on level is dubious at best.<br>

<br>
I just threw out a similar notion in this thread.<br>
<br>
I disagree with you on the level 30 issue though.  <br>
<br>
I've stated a few times that if a level 30 is trying to tell you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> how</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to kill MoBx, they're pretty much talking smack.  Levels gives you an insight into tactics, equipment, and class/skill capability.  It doesn't give any real insight into scheduling or some notion of 'fair play.'<br>
<br>
The second problem of restricting input is simply that you're going to have a hard time getting buy into a system that people aren't represented by.  When guildx gets up to a level that they can/will do things, what exactly is the reason that they should abide by a decision that they had no voice in?  I'm not speaking for/about my guild here, hell I don't think the majority of them want to get to those levels, but I can see what happens in the zones I work in... there are guilds building with pretty obvious intent of becoming planar/raid eligible.<br>
<br>
Next point, is that a few of the more levelheaded people I've seen on this server, and hence probably the right people to help set a solid framework aren't in the level range you're looking at.  Again, not talking about me or my own (I'm a somewhat opinionated type), but grabbing Evoluxa as an example there's an example of a not quite planar guild (members, yes) that has some of the more level headed people on the server.  From what I'm observing from the top levels, is there any chance you could get some of the polar opposites to agree on anything without a 'neutral' position.<br>
<br>
Which is the next point.  Having an uninvolved view provides one advantage.  They aren't voting on what's best for them right now.  Phat lewt, access to a raid, whether that mamber of {Bob's guild} pissed them off isn't as likely to be a factor in their votes/discussions.  Sometimes being distant from a problem helps more than it hurts.<br>
<br>
/shrug, I'm probably going to be flat out ignored or overlooked on this one, but I think you'd be overscrewed by not getting a mixed bag in your council ideea.  You have to involve big guilds, small guilds, and independants, or you're at best creating an uberguild by proxy, at worst creating an impotent beuracracy.<br>

The other part to that is to be able to identify potential problems in raid type environments, which a level 30 isn't going to have insite into.<br>
<br>
I'm not just suggesting high level people. What I am suggesting is high level people who are active, objective and INTELLIGENT people. People who aren't extreme (i.e. people who can compromise and not ultimatum) and people who care about our server. Sort of the same reason a presidential candidate needs to be 35 years of age or older, I think the council need to be 49th level or higher.<br>
<br>
While this shouldn't be a guild issue I can certainly see where having a few people from one guild on the council would be a conflict of interest. So I would suggest no more then two people per guild. I would also suggest a few Indies.<br>
<br>
While I don't know how you would want to pick those people here are some of the people I think would make good thinkers for the server (and keeping within the one person per guild idea):<br>
<br>
Sindarre<br>
Ulver<br>
Barrin<br>
Maryinn<br>
Adune<br>
Kayd<br>
Blyte (or whoever Fengar is playing now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Danni<br>
Okansu<br>
Melea<br>
Vulgarr<br>
Grummble<br>
Thorondar<br>
Cartumandua<br>
Groul<br>
Kemwen<br>
Justise<br>
Plainswalker (if he's still playing)<br>
Talurok<br>
Greyson<br>
Bronto<br>
<br>
There are quite a few others that if I took more then 10 minutes to think about it, I would probably recommend as well. The main criteria that I would look for are people who have the following attributes: level ranged from 49+, active players, active raiders, non-extreme personalities, and have shown leadership ability and the ability to be objective.<br>

But for something like this, I think many would agree (and if you don't I understand), there are a lot of people who would place the server's interests first. <br>

It's unfortunate, since I could easily add about 5 other SR members to that list. Same with Watchers, Blood Inferno, Thunder Legion, Legion of Heroes and so on.<br>

However I think it's VERY important that the council be and appear as objective as possible so no one can raise that gripe. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If the point of a council was to discuss the problems of a riad environment, I'd probably agree.  However, looking at the issues boiling folks on the server right now I don't see tactics being a discussion:<br>
<br>
- Should Fire Giants be reservable: (issue being recommended by several people to be revoted on) Problem: MoB spawns every eight hours, Raid is in the way of Dragon-raid which is schedulable, MoB requires coordination to take out below level 50.  Sorry, I don't see how any level acquired in EQ applies to understanding this problem.  In fact, I think a large portion of the problem here comes from the disconnect that people too high for the encounter have.<br>
<br>
- Should PoG be reservable/FCFC/mixed: (issue being involved in a number of rants and discussions).  Problem: Zone larger than any existing plane.  A single raid is highly unlikely to clear all the MoBs.  Faction issues apply meaning not 100% of the eligible raiders will hunt here.  30 hour spawntime creates an issue of overlap problems somewhat new to the raiding environment.  Once again, not exactly an issue that level provides an insight on.<br>
<br>
- What should/was/could have been done with the intentions board: (resolution now the issue).  Problems: reservation != intention.  Different people have differnt values with respecting intentions.  Some people are sick of scheduling everything.  Additional content added to game with Velious might make it less an issue to honor old intentions (i.e. there's enough to go do).  Again, this is an hours/people dilemna, not really a &quot;do I need three or four groups of level x&quot; issue.  Knowledge of MoB resists and zone layouts isn't quite the crucial knowledge here.<br>
<br>
- Should a unique encounter that respawns seven days after a succesful raid have a time limit imposed on the list for raids, if so how long... Problem: long lists of people that want in on dragon raids, leveling of old raid leaders has caused a lot of less well organized raids and a lot of failures have happened.  Once again, this isn't something that requires a first hand, been there knowledge to grasp.<br>
<br>
- Should Velious be a FCFS continent.  Issues: many people sick of scheduling everything would like to have one place to play without having to reserve/book.  Velious is a large continent and currently heavily underutilized (i.e. some zones/creatures currently completely untouched for days/weeks at a time).  Much like the other issues, I don't think a level 60 whatever has much more of a grasp on this than a level 10 whatever.<br>
<br>
- When/How should a vote be presented.  I'm not even going to touch the issues here, I'm just going to observe that the highly experienced upper levels have done such a wonderful job to date with this one as it stands, the harmonius eminating on this forum is practically overwhelming.  Most certainly lower levels wouldn't possibly know how to present an issue for people to talk about and vote on.<br>
<br>
- Raid board camping.  Problems: because the established rules for creating a raid date are timebased, the concept of camping the boards is becoming common.  Many people find this issue tedious or sickening, but necisary...  There are x guilds/groups wanting a crack at y zones over a z day window.  Again, this is not something that levels gives you any insight into other than frustration.<br>
<br>
I have a hard time thinking that Izdaari, Vaal, Charlam, Rothsamus (who now would be eligible to have an opinion on some of these issues), Relbeek, myself, or any number of people that follow these boards that aren't level 50+ couldn't identify the core problems of these issues.  <br>
<br>
This hypothetical council isn't exactly going to be coordinating mutli-guild raids on the stuff Brell hasn't dropped, they're going to be involved in some very sensitive issues that transcend level.<br>
<br>
I think disregarding the voice of the non-planar guilds is pretty much a guarantee of every one of these issues cropping back up once every two or three months (as new guilds enter the planar community).<br>
<br>
But, once again, I'm just a clueless &lt;50... (and that's not a jab at you Kruunch, just a general comment on the views of far too many of the 'informed' members of our server).<br>

Man, was that idea shot down hard.<br>
<br>
Of course, I kinda like the premise of a council -- it's much more organized,  I like the fact the only purpose is to decide what everyone should vote on ...but I'm not sure how well the idea will come off.  Not to mention, you basically have to have a large consensus on so many things - <br>
<br>
1. Should there be one?<br>
2. How big should it be? (I'm for a larger than 16 member one, if we have one at all, which I'm not too sure about.)<br>
3. Who should be on it?<br>
4. Is it going to lead to some kind of &quot;uber&quot; ness of the people on it?<br>
5. How do you REALLY get consensus? Invariably, you will have a group of people who are the &quot;have-nots&quot; in all of this.<br>
6. How do you represent Indy's and/or small guilds? With ~4000 people who actually play on Brell, though it might seem otherwise, there are far more people in smaller guilds than those who are in a premier guild..or even come to the Brell site.<br>
<br>
The more people you have on the council, the more representation you have, and thus, the more general consesus is given, and thus validation to the proposals.<br>

As Justise (if I remember right) pointed out, a true democracy is not an efficient way to get things done.  By limiting the number of folks taking part in discussions and making decisions, a great deal of efficiency is gained.  The trick is, though, to not only get &quot;level-headed thinkers&quot; but also people who are approachable so that people can provide them with input so that the members of the council are representatives of not only their own interests, but are also by proxy representatives of the server population at large.<br>
<br>
I think we need to keep the number of folks involved down closer to 12 than 24, and I also suggest having an odd number of folks involved to avoid stalemates, but the idea definitely has merit.  As far as the composition of this group goes, I personally would be much more concerned with how long they've been playing EQ on Brell than what level their &quot;main&quot; character is.  I'm sure there's lots of folks out there who started playing on Brell at around the same time that many of the level 60 folks did on Brell but for whatever reason simply haven't levelled as fast.  We need level-headed thinkers who have a good feel for the Brell Community and who are committed to helping make Brell a better place.  The idea of having a non-voting chairman involved to keep these meetings/discussions from rat holing may be something to consider as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
I do agree that just because someone is or isn't planer or just because someone is or isn't a power gamer or raid leader doesn't mean that they can't offer valuable insight when presented with straight facts.  We wouldn't want a council with totally like minds, or they will always agree on everything, and not necessarily look at all sides.  Diversity and objectivity would be a must.<br>

If you have guilds send members then you would need to have allow every guild to send someone.  You'll end up with 100 people (that many guilds listed on the bs.net guild page).<br>
