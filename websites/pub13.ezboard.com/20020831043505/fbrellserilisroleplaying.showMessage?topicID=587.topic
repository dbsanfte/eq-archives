Not just your regular dark nights though.  This one was much darker than the rest, and for the past five years, nights had been just like this.  Bolts of lightning crackled, and were thrown down towards the defenseless earth.  Thunder rolled about the lands, as if drums to a war.  There was a cold wind that particular night.  It swirled around the sky, eventually darting down towards the earth.  It whipped through trees, and by people's faces in the Eastern Commonlands, causing them to look upwards and rub their arms from the icy feeling.  The wind carried on, and dashed through the window of an inn, and on towards the forests of Nektulos.  Through the forest it blew, whipping by an occasional adventurer.  Eventually it reached the tunnels of Neriak, and assaulted a figure that seemed robed in darkness.<br><br>The Teir`dal traveller held his cloak closely around him as the harsh winds rushed by him.  He demounted, and walked towards the Neriak tunnels.  A dragoon turned his head and said, &quot;Halt.  Name yourself, or taste my steel.&quot;  The traveller looked towards the dragoon, and his eyes seemed to burn with hate.  He replied, &quot;I will pass.&quot;  The dragoon's knees buckled, and the only thing he could manage to get out was, &quot;Uhm.. yes..&quot;  The traveller entered the dark tunnels of Neriak.<br><br>Siphan tapped his foot with impatience.  Where was he?!  The king had ordered him to appear in three hours, and it was well past five.  &quot;This acquaintance of yours, Siphan, where is he?&quot; asked the king.  &quot;I do not like to be kept waiting.&quot;  Siphan nervously answered, &quot;Uhm.. he will be here, m'lord, I apologize.. he is not the most punctual of Teir`dal..&quot;  The king seemed satisfied for the moment.  They waited for another ten minutes before the dark robed Teir`dal traveller finally arrived.  The doors to the throne room opened, and he was escorted inside by two elite dragoons.<br><br>Nicobolas scanned his surroundings as he entered the throne room, and immediately noticed the gaudy throne that the King of Neriak sat upon.  &quot;Hello, mage.  I heard you had a proposal for me,&quot; said the king.  &quot;Ahh, yes, I do.  You, no doubt, are not very fond of Tunare.  Well, I believe that I have found a way to dispose of her.  There is an artifact of extreme power that I have recently acquired.  As you know, it is extremely difficult for us Teir`dal to enter the Planes of Growth, now that Tunare has placed wards against us on it.  This artifact, I believe, has enough power to destroy these wards, as well as the entire plane, if placed in the proper area once inside.  The artifact can create a negative field of energy that actually rips a hole in the fabrics of time.  It sucks anything within it's range into.. well, utter destruction..&quot;  The king raised an eyebrow. &quot;If you have the artifact, what do you need my assistance for?&quot; he questioned.  &quot;Ah, well, you see.. the artifact has much power, however, I am not able to control it as of yet.  My body cannot channel it's power without literally being disingrated.  Therefore, I need a few of your most powerful mages to come with me to help me channel it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If I give you these mages, what shall I be rewarded with?&quot; the king asked.  &quot;Why, the destruction of Tunare,&quot; replied Nicobolas.  A grin spread across his face.  &quot;Do we have ourselves a deal?&quot;  The king raised himself from his throne, and walked over to Nicobolas.  He nodded.  &quot;Yes, I believe we do.&quot;<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>End of part one.
