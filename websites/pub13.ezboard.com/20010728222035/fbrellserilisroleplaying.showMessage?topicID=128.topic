Lord Sylvanar, attired in his formal armor, was a spectacular looking man.  Cerres fretted  that he often grabbed his armor willy nilly, selecting the best weight for the battle at hand with no thought for fashion.  But his formal attire had been carefully selected by her mother, the green of the tunic setting off his eyes, the deep red cape draped over his shoulder accentuating his commanding presence.  <br>
<br>
It seemed all of Norrath had arrived for Cyris' ordination.  Cerres peered through the crowd to see if her mother was there.   She sighed as she heard the distant howl of the wolves of Tunare, answered  in a chorus announcing the arrival of the druidic priests.  Mother was undoubtedly among them, but Cerres would never be able to find her.  Father could always pick mother out of the pack, but Cerres could never much tell one wolf from another.  Oh, sometimes their eyes were different, and the shapes of their ears, the way they held their tails.  But the differences were so subtle that only those who traveled with the wolves could identify them.  Cerres longed for the day when she would be allowed to howl at the moon, kill with her teeth, and taste the blood of her enemies on her tongue.  <br>
<br>
But today was for Cyris and Cerres turned her attention once again to the well wishers.  A slight sorrow filled her when she realized that she would never share a day such as this.  As the failure clouded her spirit she pushed it aside.  &quot;Today is for Cyris&quot; she told herself, banishing all other thoughts from her mind.    <br>
<br>
A young novice approached.  &quot;Excuse me, Lord Sylvanar, but Cyris would like to see his sister before the ceremony.&quot;  Cerres patted her father's arm and ran off, following the novice into the sanctuary.  She waited in the reception room  to the side of the altar; a room where kings had waited to be crowned.<br>
<br>
Cyris entered looking beatific in the undergarments of the priesthood.  He had finished his  preparatoins  to receive the mantle of authority.   &quot;You look wonderful!&quot; Cerres said as she hugged her brother.  &quot;I'm so happy for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you tell Father?&quot;  Cyris said sternly.<br>
<br>
Cerres blushed and looked at the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted you to tell Father before the ceremony.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I tried.  I just couldn't.  He was either busy or distracted.  I couldn't find the right time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then tell him now.&quot;  Cyris stuck his head out the door and asked the novice to bring his father.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not today!  This is your day and I don't want to spoil it.  Please, Cyris.  Not today!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyris smiled at his sister.  &quot;I want you to give me an ordination present,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have one.  But you have to wait.&quot;  Cerres grinned mischeivously.  &quot;I'm not going to  give it to you until you're a priest.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nope, I want it now.   I want you to tell Father now, before the ceremony, and I want you to do it as an ordination present to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
A lump rose in Cerres' throat and she bit her lip, her eyes pleaded with her brother.  She knew she could not turn him down.   She stood silently begging for reprieve as he watched her, the set of his jaw her only answer.  She turned to the door when Lord Sylvanar entered.  His stature filled the room.  He was bigger, somehow, standing in the resplendent room with its brocaded cushions and massive tapestries.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Son, I couldn't be prouder of you.&quot; Sylvanar hugged Cyris surprised to have to reach up to hold his shoulders.  &quot;When did you gain such height?&quot; he asked.  <br>
<br>
Cyris laughed and slapped his father on the back, &quot;You're just getting short, Dad&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sylvanar noticed the tears welling in the corner of Cerres' eyes.  &quot;We're not losing him, Cerres.  You look as though the world were coming to an end.  I'm sure the two of you will be off fighting together soon, just as you used to.  Only Cerres with real swords instead of that rusty old broadsword you found in the alley.&quot; Sylvanar laughed, putting his arm around Cerres shoulders and pulling her to him.  &quot;I will never forget it.  That thing was twice your size and there stood Cyris, praying for Tunare to give you strength.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I still pray for Tunare to give her strength,&quot; Cyris remarked, a slight edge in his voice.<br>
<br>
Sylvanar looked first at Cyris and then at Cerres, recognizing the empathic communication between the twins.  &quot;Oh?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Panic welled inside of Cerres.  &quot;Go on,&quot; Cyris urged firmly.<br>
<br>
Cerres blurted the words out all at once.  &quot;Daddy, I failed.  Master Songweaver has expelled  me from the Academy.  I'm sorry, Daddy.  I'm so sorry.&quot;  Cerres buried her head in her father's shoulder.<br>
<br>
Sylvanar held Cerres and stroked her hair, comforting her.  &quot;Shhh.  It's okay.  I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.  I'll talk to the harper in the morning and we can get this all straightened out..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Father&quot; Cyris said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Son?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Father, Cerres has asked me to be her spiritual advisor.  I've thought about this a lot and I really think it best if you don't interfere.  She needs to work this out with Master Songweaver herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well.&quot; Sylvanar stepped back, the bench caught  his knee and he fell into the seat, stunned.  &quot;So, I am supplanted as a father.  How long have you known about this, Cyris?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Two months.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And you didn't tell me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was not my place, Father.  I instructed Cerres to tell you herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cerres?&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;I couldn't tell you, Daddy.  I couldn't!  I'm just so ashamed.  I didn't want you to be disappointed in me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I am,&quot; Sylvnar said, looking grave.  &quot;I am very disappointed that you didn't come to me.&quot;  Sylvanar sighed.  &quot;So, what did the harper say?  What were his reasons?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He said that if Cerres can learn humility she can re-apply.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sylvanar laughed half-hearedly.  &quot;Well, so much for her career at the Academy&quot;.<br>
<br>
Cerres stomped her foot, &quot;Daddy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cerres!&quot; Cyris barked so sharply Cerres jumped.  &quot;You have shamed our father with your failure and disappointed him with your silence.  Must you compound it by acting the petulant child!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres looked at Cyris, his anger unmasked.  The lump in her throat threatened to choke her.  &quot;Forgive me,&quot; she whispered. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is not I you have wronged.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres knelt before her father.   &quot;Father, please forgive me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, son,&quot; Sylvanar said, looking up at Cyris and  raising his eyebrows in mild surprise.    &quot;What do you suggest we do with her?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyris winked at Sylvanar, his boyhood features showing through a mischeivous smirk.  &quot;I was thinking the cloistered sisters of Tunare might be able to teach her humility.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres took an audible breath and looked at her father in shock.  Sylvanar instantly rearranged his face to hide his mirth.  &quot;An interesting choice, son.  A very interesting choice.&quot;   Sylvanar reached out and patted Cerres' head, a slight smile escaping.  &quot;I will leave you two to discuss this further.   I suspect it is time to start bringing people in for the ceremony.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres turned to Cyris and pleaded, &quot;You can't send me to the cloister.  Cyris, please.  It's all old women.  I'll shrivel and die.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyris knelt down next to Cerres and looked her hard in the eye.  &quot;You asked me to become your advisor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, can't I stay here?  I could learn just as well and at least there's boys.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to choose me.   You can return to Uncle Fastiblyr and wrap him and Father around you little finger like you always have.  And never return to the Academy.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;There must be an easier way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyris sighed.  &quot;Downhill is always the easier way, sis.  But eventually it leads into a pit.  You can wait for Dad to rescue you like always, or you can grab the rope I'm tossing you and start climbing.  The choice is yours, as are the consequences.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cyris stood up and strode toward the door to the alter and paused, looking back at his sister with compassion.  &quot;If you do choose to be my supplicant, I could use some help with my robes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres watched Cyris as he quietly left the room.  When he was gone, she hugged herself and let the weight of her shame and confusion bear down upon her, crumpling her into a ball.  She rocked herself back and forth and slowly began to sing.  &quot;Tunare, Tunare, ashveat bi menacar&quot; (Tunare, Tunare, give me strength).   She sang from a deep emptiness in the core of her being,   Selo's Last Lament.    <br>
<br>
Cerres began the arpegio,  letting the lament sing through her:  <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Brit beamat baearg<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Spillmean treaes fler<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Shanti  strearg<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp (In days of sorrow<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Leaves of fear<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Peace tomorrow<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
As she finished the final descension, her voice softened into a rich, clear pianissimo.  &quot;Sham aftra rait trer&quot; (The path is clear.)  Cerres rose unsteadily.  Her legs trembled. Taking a deep breath, she followed her brother to help with his robes. <p>Cerres Swiftfyre <BR>
