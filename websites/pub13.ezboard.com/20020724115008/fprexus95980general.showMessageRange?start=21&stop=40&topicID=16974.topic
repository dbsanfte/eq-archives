<br>
Couple tips:<br>
<br>
Never, ever under any circumstances hold anything for anyone.. if they don't want it anymore let them throw it out, if they're afraid of getting caught with it, tough... it is NOT your problem.. don't make it your problem<br>
<br>
Never, ever under any circumstances interfere with an arrest. Stay back, never approach an officer unless you are in full view and ask permission to leave. <br>
<br>
Stay the @#%$ away from drugs. Don't do them and if you are hanging around with someone and they're holding.. leave. <br>
<br>
I'm not suprised with anything anymore, read in the news a few days back they caught an 8 year old dealing in elementary school.. of course he was also carrying a gun. <br>
<br>
Hope that cop scared the @#%$ out of everyone involved and gave them a few lumps to remember.<br>

Don't take advice from anyone who posts on this message board and for the love of god don't take it from me.  I could be smoking crack right now and you would never know it.<br>
<br>
Your attorney is the only person legally obligated to protect your interests over all other interests.  You and your friends need pictures, written documentation and need to see lawyers.<br>
<br>
Talking to your school counselor about this is terrible advice - they work for the institution at which these events took place.  They have their interests to protect here and if their interests conflict with your interests then your interests will likely not be protected.<br>
<br>
As for police, cops don't serve you as an individual - they serve this nameless intangible entity called the public.  They also have careers to protect and families to feed.  Personally, if I were a cop I would lie to protect my job and family's source of food, clothing and shelter if the situation called for it.<br>

<br>
I'd suggest telling your friends to make SURE they tell the full truth to the attorney they have. They are covered under confidentiality to speak with them and should. Many people are afraid of telling the full truth fearing somehow someone else will find out, its very important that they express exactly what happened and why.<br>
<br>
As for you whitnessing these acts, I'd suggest telling the parents of your two friends (because they are going to have to deal with the lawyer too) EXACTLY what you saw. While some of it may be bad for your friends or may not look &quot;as bad&quot; as you'd like it to for the cop(s) it's important that you be honest and clear with them.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to give a speech about drugs, though I think any smart person realizes that they arn't harmless nor are they the bane of all existence, these are type of things that can happen when your involved with drugs. And sometimes innocent people get caught up in it and ARE going to get hurt or arrested for doing things like carrying it for a freind or hanging out and being in a very suspcious situation with someone who does.<br>
<br>
Good luck though and feel proud for going ahead and behing honest and forward about what you saw, its a measure of a true friend to do that in face of cops or adults who might label you &quot;just another punk&quot;<br>

<br>
All of these friends were hanging out talking @#%$ being cool to each other, some of them were talking about drugs, but it was obvious that they were all friends and hanging out ... no matter what exact wording was of everything they said I could easily see why the officer would think it reasonable that all of them were involved with drugs. ... and if one of them is in the bathroom, while the officer runs in, you think he could flush the drugs down the toilet? Got to move fast there I bet, I doubt the officer had any intention of hurting the kid but was in the hurry to find more drugs<br>
<br>
So your sister was &quot;repeatedly asking&quot; was she? Not getting an answer? Standing quietly on the side, away from the officers, not hysterical or screaming, quietly and calmly asking why her husband was arrested, and when receiving no answer, asking again 2 minutes later, and  for this an officer walked over to her and started beating her ?<br>
<br>
Yeah like hell.<br>
<br>
I have friends that have been arrested, and I've even witnessed what has happened twice, and, frankly, the story my friends tell later, to justify what they did, making the police look bad, was so far from the actual truth of the incident it wasn't even funny<br>
<br>
Pardon me for disbelieving 99% of what people say when they come and state cases of police brutality, most of the time people are just lying like hell<br>
<br>
Of course, if @#%$ happens and there is a case, police officers support each other too, but guess why? It wouldn't have a thing to do with almost all cases against them being completely groundless and most people lying like hell to try to make a case? Nah, not at all<br>
<br>

If arrested or detained do not speak with the authorities without someone present, lawyer and/or parent, to protect your interests and keep you from saying the WRONG things.  be AWARE the authorities can do alot with just one YES or NO from you.<br>
<br>
RESPECT the law, respect the officers that administer the law.  If someone is known to be violent tempered or violent during arrests inform the superior officers and let them investigate.  <br>
<br>
I STRESS:  you may have seen alot, heard alot but do not spread stories about the law, their rep is not BAD for the reason you think but the reason of a few rotten apples ruin the barrel.  you can't assume that ALL law officers are mean, violent or anything from one or two in your area.<br>

This may have been somewhat true in the past, but from my experience as a Police Officer in California, those cops who lie for another no matter how menial the incident...gets FIRED.  Honesty is a highly stressed throughout a Police Officers training and development.  We are not taught to lie in the Academy.  From day one, I was always taught to be truthful from Academy teachers to Field Training Officers, to fellow collegues.  <br>
<br>
The backgrounds investigation to a potential Police Officers application is extremely thorough, and a potentially dishonest background (asides from criminal arrests, credit check history etc.) will get an applicant washed out of the selection process.  Anyone who has either tested to become a Police Officer or is one now, would agree with me.  We are NOT taught to be racist, we are NOT taught to violate peoples rights.  Those very few who do deserve no special treatment imho.  <br>
<br>
And no, I am not exaggerating.   Just about ALL of us out there don't think it's worth lying for another cop because 1) It's immoral and 2) It's not worth losing your house and job over trying to cover for someone else's foul up. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying I'm more special than anyone else.  I do my job to the best of my abilities and try to give us a good name.  But you wouldn't believe how often I'm stereotyped as a bad person because of the uniform I wear.  I treat everyone just the way I would expect to be treated...as a human being.  <br>

Legal advice based on what you hear on the street is misleading. I think that every law student who takes Criminal Procedure sits there the whole semester and says, &quot;WTF?!!! The police can do that?!!!&quot;  (even the REALLY conservative kids scratch their heads in disbelief sometimes)<br>
<br>
1.  You do NOT have to be read your Miranda Rights when you are arrested.  Nor do you have to be read your Miranda Rights before questioning.  In fact, the police NEVER EVER have to read you your Miranda Rights. They only have to read you your Miranda Rights if they want to use what you say in court. They will never, under any circumstances, be punished for violating this rule, which the Supreme Court has over and over again called prophylactic (of course individual departments might punish them and state constitutions may proscribe such behavior).  The only real &quot;punishment&quot; for such behavior is the exclusionary rule, which prevents any illegally obtained confession or the fruits of an unconstitutional interrogation from being admitted in court.  The only exception to this is the attenuation doctrine (a constitutional violation does not prevent police questioning ad infinitum).<br>
<br>
2.  As for reasonable suspicion, definitely.   Under the jurisprudence of the current Court, there was almost certainly probably cause to arrest as well.<br>
<br>
3.  There is no constitutional right for a minor to have an attorney present during questioning.  Only if a minor invokes his or her Sixth Amendment rights are the police required to provide an attorney (and even then it's only if they want to question the person).  Of course state constitutions and even statutes differ greatly from the federal constitution and may be more restrictive.  <br>
<br>
The sad truth is that the police can do a lot of crooked @#%$, and the Supreme Court looks the other way.  It sucks, but it's the way it will be as long as people keep electing Republican Presidents (If Clinton hadn't been elected, there would be no Roe v. Wade anymore).  If you don't like some of the underhanded stuff that police do while arresting and interrogating suspects, pray that Bush doesn't get reelected.  Justice Stevens is 83 now, and won't live much longer.  And that 5-4 majority giving police much more expansive power can quickly turn to a 6-3, which will lead to even more police power. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I'm sure from his point of view this is what happened but take someone else who doesn't know anyone involved and have them watch the same incident and you will get a different story.  Hanging around drug users may make you think you are cool but when I was in high school the drug users weren't that cool, most people knew they were wasting their lives and remaining few live brain cells.  This isn't about whether or not you are a responsible drug user, the kids in this story were selling drugs in a high school.  In my opinion that is the lowest of the low.  You may personally think marijuana is the best thing in the world and does no harm but as of right now it is against the law.  Not everyone is a major league baseball player making $10 million a year and thusly immune to the laws of the country.<br>

<br>
All of us aren't out there screwing people up, and smoking massive amounts of weed.  They're just the ones that get the attention.<br>
<br>
Intelligent teens don't attract attention, that's the problem.  The whole world sees only the idiots who cause problems, and they stereotype all teens to be &quot;hooligans&quot; or &quot;ruffians&quot;.<br>
<br>
The generation I belong to doesn't respect intelligence.  Teens today don't understand the power that knowledge and intelligence can bring, and they ostracize those that have intelligence.  I have had people try and start fights with me, and after I verbally bitch-slap them, they say &quot;You stupid smart kid&quot;.  /boggle.<br>
<br>
Learn who you are stereotyping before you do please.  The majority of teens today do deserve the bad reputation they get, but those of us that don't shouldn't be put into a group with the others.<br>

From the way he explained it, the kid knew the other person had drugs and did not make an attempt to stop or report him.  In my eyes that is an arrestable offense.  Drugs are bad, I don't care what the users that posted on the 420 post say.  I have seen what these drugs can do to people.  And no I'm not saying that alcohol is good.  <br>
<br>
I am a teen myself, and I am guilty of what I stated before.  I have been around drugs, I see them almost every day.  Why don't I report it to the police?  It's their life, let them ruin it.  I've never smoked a cigarette in my life, let alone a hit of weed.  I stay clear of their business and they steer clear of mine.  However, drug use, and drug selling are 2 totally different areas.<br>
<br>
WHAT THE HELL WAS HE DOING WITH DRUGS AT SCHOOL!  THAT SELLER IS THE BIGGEST DUMBASS I HAVE EVER HEARD OF!  NEVER SELL DRUGS OR ANY ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE AT SCHOOL!  WHY!?  CUZ THERE IS ALWAYS AN ADMINISTRATOR OR COP ON DUTY!  <br>
