I have read posts where several bards seem to feel that a bard using his weapons is something to cringe at so I have been experimenting with a variety of different attacks. Thx to the Bug groups who have put up with my experimenting.<br>
<br>
First off the weapons I use are the sionachies partisan and the crystaline short sword. <br>
<br>
I have tried the chants and cessation approach and it slows down the groups kill speed greatly. We as bards just do not inflict enough damage with these dots. Also while I twist these dots, using selo's drum, I have a very difficult time adding in any songs that benefit the group as a whole. Hence I am currently leaning away from this attack approach.<br>
<br>
Secondly I lowered my charisma and raised my str. I then concentrated on VoV, cessation, and clarity, while I hammered away on whatever poor bug entered my killing field. This worked extremely well. Surprisingly I hit, with VoV on, relatively well. Yes most hits where in the 20-40 range but they were accumulating very quickly.<br>
<br>
Lastly in a group rich with casters I tried Jonathons Provocation on the monk while singing clarity and cessations. That was rather funny actually as Leewei raged last night. This also worked rather well as the prov apparently has a small dmg absorption to it. Couldn't get confirmation on that out of Leewei though.<br>
<br>
What is interesting is our group killed extremely fast when I broke out the tin toys. When I tried the chant-cessation route I negatively impacted the group and we had more down time building up mana. The prov-cess-clarity route was just funny as hell didn't seem to make much difference either way.<br>
<br>
So that leaves me wondering....<br>
<br>
Why exactly do some bards get uptight about laying the smack down. Many times it is the best method of approach. <br>
<br>
I will agree though that some of the 50's songs definitely lend creedance to sticking to instruments and I expect I will be going that route when I get the songs. But so far at lvl 51 I still am finding that given the bug a good whack may be whats in the best interest of your group.<br>

P.S. If you end up in a group with only one tank that 45 Song rocks. Just sit back Prov-Cess-Clarity with horn on and watch the Tank RAGE.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uhagum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hagum</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ualr.edu/~jmglidden/skull.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#CC9900>(10/12/00 11:36:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.ualr.edu/~jmglidden/skull1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Another age old bard debate</span><hr size=1> Do you mean to say Celerity or Clarity? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udabard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dabard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#CC9900>(10/12/00 12:20:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Another age old bard debate</span><hr size=1> Ummm clarity.

In the Caster heavy group I would play Chants non-stop.  The reduction in the MR/CR/FR in addition to the DoT's will greatly reduce the resists your casters will be seeing.  In Tank heavy groups I tend to play VoV, CoB and Niv's usually.  It depends.  If we do not have a Shaman I will replace Niv's with Largo's.  If we have a Chanter the whole scheme needs to be re-thought as they do so many of our functions in a group and better.  To all things there is an answer. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

Why?  Due to the range of some songs, I need to be closer to the action than a caster wants to get typically.  I tend to tell clerics to let me know when they hit 40 and druids( if no other healer) 50 mana. I then back out of the fight and sing mana song exclusively.  I prefer to keep my healers happy.  Other casters should know how to manage their mana in battle.<br>
<br>
For crowd control, I tend to use charm only.  Don't trust Mez any more.  I'll charm one and snare another if I have to control 2.  Make the charmed one fight the snared one and that usually gets me enough time to keep the 2 mobs fighting each other.<br>
<br>
As far as other songs during fights, really depends on group make up.  Though there are no longer too many songs to choose from, there are enough that decisions need to be made.  I think I am down to only using about 13 songs out of the 51 I have to choose from at this point.  There are about 5 more that I wish were still usable though. =(<br>

SInce I am in BnB more often then not I generally have a group in a packed spot. Hence singing mana in battle generally covers the whole room as long as I stay in the center of the room. This works since the Mob is generally within striking range if I am in the middle of the room.<br>
<br>
I am sure this will prob change when I move to more unfamiliar territory.<br>

Testing on the manasong was done ages ago by Concert Hall bards (Rokenn or Kaeria, possibly both of them!) which determined you could twist the manasong and one other song with little to no effectiveness lost on clarity.  Three songs reduces clarity a little further, I believe it was 70% efficiency but I can't quite remember.<br>
<br>
I know sometimes it's nice to take a twisting break and actually hold a conversation or two <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but if you can be bothered, throwing in hymn, or that other extra song isn't going to hurt those manahungry casters.<br>
<br>
Now, tell this to your group.  Tell this to your friends.  Tell the world, so we don't all hear<br>

sometimes in a group where no one is slowing, ill use damage shield song with VoV and usually heal song.. good amount of dmg output (using weapons)<br>

now that our mez is fixed i have been sticking to a lot more charisma gear. <br>

my current weapons are evensong and jagged chokadai spine, they are good, but not the best a bard can use, and i usually get pretty good dmg, my ATK is up to 912 buffless.<br>
