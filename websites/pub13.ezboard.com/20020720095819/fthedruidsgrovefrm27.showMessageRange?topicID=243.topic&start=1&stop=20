Unlike many of you, I've been on Albion as a Friar.   He's level 29 (would be MUCH higher if I weren't a guildmaster, sheesh, it's alot of work)<br>
I also have an Armsman and a Cleric although much lower.<br>
<br>
Last night I went to Igraine and made a Stungard dorf healer.<br>
<br>
Several things I found already.<br>
<br>
I started fresh, by myself, no money, nada.<br>
<br>
By level 2(less than 3 minutes), I was covered head to toe with leather.  While it has crappy AF, it's got that absorb that works fine.<br>
<br>
By the time I was 4, I had amassed 25 silver.    When I dinged five, I was half covered in store bought(don't recall the name of the stuff), and had a decent orange hammer and I _STILL_ have about 10 silver left.<br>
<br>
This all in the space of under 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
The places I fought right around Mularn had consistant color spawns and there was plenty of prey.   There were no red or higher roamers amidst a sea of blues like there is in Camelot hills with the bandits.<br>
<br>
All the mobs seemed drop more loot than Albion and the loot they did have seemed to sell for about double similar items sell for in Albion.   I recall lots of &lt; 10 copper items off skells  and such in Albion.   The stuff around Mularn was selling for 15-30 coppers off level 2-3 mobs.   I would like to see loot drop percentages and sale value, kill for kill in all the realms.  I suspect Midgard has an edge here.<br>
<br>
My Armsman in Albion took an hour or so by himself to get to level 5.   He started with 10 gold(it took about 20 silver to completely outfit him) and even having this advantage, his funds after 5 levels hadn't even broken back over 10 gold.  He got ZERO armor drops.<br>
<br>
I've read that others have found the same thing.  Now I'm a believer.  If the trend continues, then what others have said is true; It is easier to level in Midgard.<br>
<br>
I'm going to work on this guy over the weekend and see what I end up with.  I suspect he'll get 12(where my armsman is at) much quicker as He was mowing thru stuff just using his chumpy hammer.   My cleric had it much rougher for some reason.<br>
<br>
If I can level this one like I suspect, I'm going to have renewed interest in the game(close to cancelling).  At 29 on Galahad, I'm outgrowing the crowded catacombs and I'm a bad backup healer in the barrows.   Llyn barfog has greened out and Lyonesse is hugely purple.    In the snow frontier I'm archer bait while trying to get experience and forest savauuge just sucks.  The mobs in the forest go from very grey to very purple in a hurry and they are mostly trees which really smack leather wearers around since it's not a slash attack.<br>
There is a very narrow band of things that I can fight and it's mostly in cornwall, which by the volume of people there indicates I'm not alone.  <br>
<br>
Ah well, that's my babble for the day.<br>

I did find armor in my location in midgard harder to acquire than hibernia.  the only thing i found that dropped it was wildlings which were not that plentiful.  i did manage to get a full suit by level 3 (with a few woolen pieces thrown in though) just by concentrating on greens and trying to get wildlings to spawn while in level 2.  <br>
<br>
however, as you said you got alot of money, i didnt.  there were mostly animals near vasudheim, and they didnt drop much in the way of loot.  the loot they did drop was selling for approx 20 cp, give or take though.<br>
<br>
by level 5 i had a yellow sword (actually looted this off a thrall as a rare drop though), beginning cruddy AF armor, and a whopping 25 sp.  i promptly trained in armorcraft at level 5 though and used all that 25 sp to train armorcraft to 115ish and make myself new armor.  so i am decently outfitted for level 5, but only because i spent an hour or so doing armorcrafting.  currently i am broke because i didnt want to do consignments with my former laggy system for a few measly coppers and so i just power skilled.<br>
<br>
right now i am finding it hard to find things to fight (that dont have faction hits, trying to steer away from ruining too many) that actually drop very much to sell.  mostly what i find that i can fight are animals, which is the same scenario i was in to start with.  granted if i went exploring more i am sure i would find something /shrug<br>
<br>
overall, i found it easier to level in midgard, but more money in hibernia.  ease of level could be my class choices though and since i have only played a druid and bard in hibernia and skald in midgard, this isnt exactly scientific =)<br>
<br>
perhaps the area i was in just wasnt as good as the area you were in.  <br>
<br>
i do have to say that the graphics in midgard look much nicer to me.  overall i get a general feel that things were worked on more than in hibernia.<br>
<br>
i have been getting in that same rut as you, getting close to cancelling, out of boredom.  thats why i made the skald.  actually found myself tempted to check out sol in EQ too, so you know the boredom was setting in =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/28/01 10:23:15 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I sampled the dark side</span><hr size=1> Llyn Barfog doesn't even come <i>close</i> to greening out at level 29.  If you go to the bwgan camp by the lake, I don't think you even see a green until level 30 or 31, and even then it takes a few levels for all of them to green out.  Easy solo area and enough rapid spawns to satisfy a mid 20s group or 1 or 2 level 30 soloers.  Great coin from these guys, but no other loot.  There are also bwgwl skeletons above at around the same level range, and they have same loot.  When you have exhausted those, there is a fort of undead near the very top which has NPCs in the low 30s, perfect for a small level 30 group.  All this time, there is an extremely convenient vendor by the lake to sell your goods.  After you've exhausted the fort, you'll be in the prime level range for Barrows or something similar.<br>
<br>
Your experience in Midgard is interesting, but have you considered that maybe only the starting area you chose there was better than your Albion starting locations.  I do vividly remember Campacorentin Forest sucking pretty badly as a starting location, but it got a lot better as I moved out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalbor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malbor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druid in Absentia<br>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/28/01 10:41:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/malbor/malbor.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I sampled the dark side</span><hr size=1> <br>
&gt;&gt;Llyn Barfog doesn't even come close to greening out at level 29&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yeah, it sorta does.  The Bwgans are mostly green.  The Bwgan elders are the only thing left that's blue and they are only 20% of the population.  The hobgobs, Cythrauls(cept that one mean one) and boars are grey or green.   The Dinos(alfanc) in the water Are mostly blue, but unless you get a pristine alfanc hide, the loot sucks and besides...fighting in the water sucks.   The monks are yellow or orange, but perma camped and come in groups of 3.  If you group to kill them, you need a tank that can tank 3 and then he's not getting good exp.   There are a few rare singles, but they aren't regular fare.<br>
<br>
The Cyclops are still red/orange but only 3 of those on a slow spawn.<br>
<br>
The Bwgals are red, but where is there a consistant group of them?  I only see one on occasion and I've been around that whole area many times.<br>
<br>
I guess what i meant by 'greening out' was that it's not nearly the target rich area it was at 25/26/27/28.   I got most of those levels in Llyn Barfog solo or with a partner.   It's so-so exp solo and not worth it for any group that can take the bigger ones.<br>
<br>
I'm just finding the whole Midgard experience to be much more kind than Albion has ever been.  I'll post a followup in a few days and see if the experience holds true.<br>

<br>
No, I think you haven't been looking in the right areas.  Look at my crude map, shamelessly ripped from daatlas.com:<br>
<br>
<img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/barfog.txt><br>
<br>
In the circle marked "A" is a bwgan camp that has about 6 to 8 lake-side fishermen spawns and 4 spawns (3 linked) a bit further in, including a level 30 quest NPC named Ifor.  If you're soloing as a friar, stick to the lakeside spawns which are not linked for the most part.  (You'd swear they were linked by their proximity to one another, but only very rarely will even two be linked.)  The fishermen in this camp are levels 26 to 31, considerably higher than the low 20s bwgan you see wandering elsewhere, such as the few that normally walk the coastline.  They are also physically bigger.  If you feel comfortable handling 4 at a time, you can also pull the Ifor camp.  Altogether you have a ton of great NPC spawns in a small area.<br>
<br>
Now just up the hill from spot A, the oval I marked as "B", is an area where bwgwl spawn.  You really shouldn't need to go here if you're soloing, but if you're sharing the bwgan area, consider it.  A minimum of 6 high 20s bwgwl spawn in this area, usually walking near the edge of the hill.  Very often they will be linked, though, even in groups of 3.<br>
<br>
Now at approximately "C" is the undead fort containing the low 30s undead.  This area is usually camped more than the others, but with some sort of crowd control you're in business.  And sorcerers are attracted to Llyn Barfog because the bwgan camp is one of the few excellent soloing spots for soloing sorcerers.  Easy, reliable experience. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxzzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xzzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/28/01 12:34:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I sampled the dark side</span><hr size=1> > All the mobs seemed drop more loot than Albion and the loot they did have seemed to sell for about <br>

<br>
Heh, coming from a hippie who's experimented with midgard a little, I found midgard loot to be much poorer than hibernia. ;) A newbie can easily get two full suits of armor by level 5, ranging from cloth to leather. Newbie areas are much more densely populated than the ones I saw in midgard, as well.<br>
<br>
I don't recall how long it takes to get up to that milestone first gold, but I do know I was never hurting for cash until the 20's when dropped armor was getting hard to find and player made was getting expensive.<br>

It seems like when I explored last there all I found where grey devil thingies and grey bwgan roamers.<br>
<br>
The Monk section is too hard solo(can't do 3) and last time I tried those fishermen, I wasn't able to find any that weren't linked.   I have no ability to pull other than inching forward and hoping the camp doesn't come running.<br>
<br>
I also didn't realize there was a concentration of Bwgals up on the hill behind the camp.  If there's a steady enough diet of those, that's ideal for a small group.<br>
<br>
The Bwgans, Cwr Annan's and such I was referring to are on the south-SE side of the lake with the 3 cyclops.   Those blue bwgans award me 500k(plus bonuses) or so per kill.   The Alfanc's are 500-700k(plus any bonus), but you have no option of running if you are in the water and get an add.  The bwgans do on occasion drop fellwood shields as well as reasonable silver(5-15) and other gems and such.<br>

Starting is Vasudiem you go towards the big city of Jordiem to find rattling skeletons for armor drops in the beginning.<br>
Vale of Mularn was where I went to hunt with my 2nd char sticking mostly to hobgoblins  for faction considerations, those and of course the woodeaters.<br>
Got a couple good drops off the hobs including a decent hammer.<br>
<br>
Up until lvl 8 or so with my primary character I was too proud to take any handouts from guildmates and was soloing.<br>
Knowing where to hunt would have made a huge differance. I scrimped and saved going with all storebought armor and the gift of a lovely hammer the weaponsmith refused to take payment for (went to the big city and auctioned for it at lvl 5).<br>
<br>
With my alt char I dropped her in Mularn, did the newby quests then went to town on skellies for armor then hobs for cash and exp.<br>
Knowing where to go made all the differance in the world in leveling time.<br>
<br>
Just as Mal was able to point you towards a good hunting spot here. The mobs are there you just have to explore a bit to find them.<br>

Minor Update here.<br>
<br>
I got home tonight and finally found Rana the Healer trainer.  I was looking for her last night when I went to bed.<br>
<br>
All I gotta say is SHEESH.<br>
<br>
Now granted, I checked out what Mid Healers get, but @#$%.<br>
<br>
I hadn't trained anything until 5 and at 5, I went 5 points into augmentation since I wanted the run buff.<br>
<br>
So, I spent half an hour killing greenies testing out spells and stuff.<br>
<br>
My healer gets:<br>
<br>
AF buff<br>
Haste Buff<br>
STR buff<br>
CON buff<br>
<br>
He gets a free dmg add.  Similar to what thurgs and wizards get, but this one is a conc based so costs no additional mana.<br>
<br>
Free Run speed like a minstrel<br>
<br>
The best heals and some instant ones later on.<br>
<br>
Single target stun.  AOE Stun.   Single Target mez and hatelist management.<br>
<br>
This guy is a chain wearing Minstrel/Theurg/Cleric all rolled up into one.   The only lack is the weapon, but with the bonus dmg, that helps things a ton.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just disgusting me.<br>
<br>
My friar gets a haste line.   Once that costs power constantly and would last 2-3 minutes tops at 29...not a permanent buff.  It also doesn't stack with his End buff that also costs power constantly.<br>
<br>
This guy gets chain, my friar gets leather.   Friar's are a 2h class, this healer gets a shield.<br>
While friars can SORTA use a shield, the only one they can equip is the starter shield.  It's still bugged, even though they are supposed to be able to use a shield.  The weapon would be useless since friars can't train a 1h.   Friars have no range spells.   Healers do.<br>
<br>
To top all this off....the healer gets a power regen spell!!  SHEESH.<br>
<br>
crowd control, best buffs, best healing, range attacks and chain armor.   No doubt about it...Mid Healers are the closest thing to a tank mage going.<br>
<br>
Grr.   I can't believe how gimped friars are.   Sure, my friar can dish damage...he just can't take it.  If I use my best styles, they are higher aggro even if less damage than an Armsman.  I think someone got beat up by Monks as a child and took it out on Friars in this game.<br>

Wanted to throw in my 2 cents on this.  I play a 44 druid.  Started a healer for fun.<br>
<br>
The first thing that got my attention was the dwarf race.  Base con - 80.  Base Pie - 60.  Wow.  I bumped up con by 15 pts and threw the rest in to piety.  Where is the weakness of the dwarf?  The weak stats (dex and qui) are both at 50.  Firbs get 40 in dex and qui for 90 str...  :(  Should be 90 con.<br>
<br>
I started near Jordheim, dunno the name of the town.  Found the loot to be OK but with the insane amount of con I ended up with, yellows are no problem.  I imagine that an augmentation healer could do blues pretty easily.  Easier than my regrowth/nurture druid anyway, w/the pure con buff that healers get and everything else.  Doubt there are a lot of augmentation healers with the pacification line the way it is though (kind of like nurture druids :P )<br>

At level 15 I still can't afford even con armor (not that it really matters as a caster) and I'm wearing mostly green with a pair of orange con gloves.  I never had any trouble buying level appropriate gear in Hibernia with either my druid or my ranger, and that was with buying arrows all the time with my ranger.  I haven't played much of Midgard other than briefly in beta, but even then I did notice the great deal of money/loot that I could get.<br>
<br>
(One thing that I think really helped the money situation early on in Hib is the fact that level 5 - 7 mobs were dropping treasure chests, which would have anywhere from 70 cp to 12 sp in them - I've only found one mob so far in Albion that drops them and those were the scrags in the Avalonian Marsh that were level 8 - 9ish) <p><b><font size=3 color=0066FF>Salicia Swiftfoot</b><br></font><font size=2 color=red><i>Theurgist to the Stars</i></font><br><font size=3 color=0066FF><b>Galahad Server<br>DAoC Moderator for <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/29/01 1:55:32 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I sampled the dark side</span><hr size=1> Salicia says:  <b><i>level 5 - 7 mobs were dropping treasure chests</b></i><br>

You get treasure chests in Albion if you kill a group of linked NPCs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujalia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jalia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/29/01 4:40:24 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.sprynet.com/~nausicaa/minifigures/doll16.gif width=54 height=147></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I sampled the dark side</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
Not to overstate the money thing too much -- hard for me to compare anyway, since I've mostly played just in Midgard -- but there are a lot of nice quests for nice items in Midgard, which is another big help when it comes to keeping yourself outfitted in good armor.  From what I've heard the Midgard quests are generally better in all respects than elsewhere.<br>

Another update...<br>
<br>
I spend most of today installing a heater in our bedroom.  The rest of today however I levelled my Mid healer to 7.  While the speed of levelling has slowed a bit as normal, I'm not dying.  That's a good thing :)<br>
<br>
I've hit the cash crunch though.   I'm broke now.  I'm keeping my chest piece yellow or orange(it's 70% of your armor, there's a page about it) the rest is quickly turning an ugly grey shade of green. heh<br>
<br>
I've spent prolly 3 hours to get from just in 5 to 4 bubs of 7.   It seems again, so far, that there is better low levelling in mid.  It took me about two weeks to get my arms up to 12, but I have a job, a wife, and duties outside of the game.  I'm thinking I'll have a 12 healer by late sunday....<br>
<br>
I'll be sure to add to this post ad naseum.<br>

update again...<br>
<br>
Well into 7.  Not the 12 I was hoping for, but what can you do? heh.  I havn't played my dorf since we've had some rather fun RvR wars.  Hibs took Benowyc and 3 hours later we took it back.<br>
<br>
Gotta say...enjoying my Alliance.  I'm a GM of my guild of about 60 people on Galahad Albion.  We're in prolly the largest alliance on the server....we marshalled our forces once we organized(and got the 50s  around) we took over.  Loved it :)<br>
<br>
It's good to be the King!<br>

Knights who Say Ni Scirocco.<br>

Yeah, I know...silly name.  I wasn't around when the guys made it...but became the GM thereafter.  It wouldn't be my guild tag had I choice in the matter.<br>
<br>
We're allied with The Black Watch, Defenders of Order, The Ancient Order and Circulus Trium.<br>
<br>
Rageous kept the invaders at bay by himself at Sursbrooke.  Course...he's a 50. heh.  <br>
<br>
And yes...In any game I play I'm Malbor.   I invented the name in 97.  I was Malbor the Small. in Diablo.    Turns out Malbor is an Evil spanish god or something.   It has nothing to do with smokes though.  I was MALcontented and BORed and I thunked up the name.   Now here I am. heh.<br>
