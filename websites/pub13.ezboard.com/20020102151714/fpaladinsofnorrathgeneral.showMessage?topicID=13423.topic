<br>
At the release of Shadows of Luclic Thunder of Karana was seriously unbalanced. Three or four paladins could relatively easily shut down all special effects of  an ¡¥ueber¡¦ mob by chain casting ToK. Examples are 12 people slaying Sontalek or a Lady Vox/Gorenaire fight that was reduced to the difficult of fighting a giant in Kael. Action had to be taken quickly and the spell was changed to a mana sieve spell. <br>
<br>
Discussion of a Workable Silencing Spell<br>
<br>
The paladin community started discussing a fair replacement spell that fulfilled the original intend of the spell: to give paladins a specific raid role by granting them the ability to counter gate and complete heal spells of dragons. Dragon¡¦s AoE breath weapons and special procs should not be silenceable. <br>
<br>
We discussed different options and we came to the conclussion that only a spell that was chainable by several paladins would fulfill the hopes of us paladins. We were hoping that a raid force desired to have more than just one paladin for Divine Strength on a raid. A chainable spell would accomplish that. Secondarily, silencing a dragon for only one spell duration would only mean that a dragon would gate or complete heal after the six seconds passed. Only a chainable version of a silence spell would make a noticable but not encounter changing difference in a battle.<br>
<br>
The original spell statistics for mana, duration and recast time were perfect. Thunder of Karana would have found good but not unbalancing use in raid scenarios as well as regular fights in places like Sebilis or Karnor¡¦s Castle. The resist levels were well balanced for single or chained use of the spell. Only the inadvertant AoE breath weapon or special attack silencing has to be corrected. <br>
<br>
Implementation of a Working Silence Spell<br>
<br>
From there we discussed different implementations that would allow AoE breath weapons and procs to continue but regular spells like Complete Heal and Gates to be silenced. We understand these special attacks of dragons are coded as spells similar to any other spell.<br>
<br>
In the selection of the approach we tried to find a method that would not require extensive programming, reviewing each mob's spell selection or time intensive flagging of mobs and spells that can be silenced. Only an approach that could globally be applied and does not require review of all mobs in Everquest would be feasable. There is a general concern in the paladin community that any complex implementation would be discussed but due to time and cost issues never implemented. <br>
<br>
There are a few approaches that could be used to restrict the repertoire of a silenced dragon¡¦s spells to only AoE or proc weapons without excessive implementation cost. Restrict the spell list of a silenced dragon to only spells that:<br>
<br>
o have a cast time of less than 1 second <br>
o have zero mana cost<br>
<br>
Or alternatively lower the channeling skill of a dragon by 95% when the dragon is silenced. This would similarily to restricting the spell selection list allow fast casting AoE weapons and procs to succeed but gates and complete heals to be interrupted.<br>
<br>
We believe that the suggested implementation options would fulfill the great initial thought of  the Thunder of Karana spell and give Paladins a specific and accumulative raid role they lack so badly. The risk of introducing an unbalancing spell with this implementation is low, so is the development cost.<br>
<br>

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, <br>
<br>
At the release of Shadows of Luclin, the paladin spell Thunder of Karana was seriously unbalanced. Three or four paladins could relatively easily shut down all special effects of an uber mob or high level encounter by chain casting Thunder of Karana. Examples are 12 people slaying Sontalek or Lady Vox/Gorenaire.A fight that was reduced to the difficult of fighting a giant in Kael. Action had to be taken quickly and the spell was changed to a mana sieve spell. <br>
<br>
Discussion of a Workable Silencing Spell<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The paladin community started discussing a fair replacement spell that fulfilled the original intent of the spell: to give paladins a specific raid role by granting them the ability to counter gate and complete heal spells of high end encounters and mobs. Dragon AoE's, breath weapons and special procs should not be affected by the silence. <br>
<br>
We discussed different options and we came to the conclusion that only a spell that was chaincastable by several paladins would fulfill the hopes of us paladins. We were hoping that a raid force desired to have more than just one paladin for Divine Strength on a raid. A chaincastable spell would accomplish that. Secondarily, silencing a dragon for only one spell duration would only mean that a dragon would gate or complete heal after the six seconds passed. Only a chainable version of a silence spell would make a noticable difference, but not trivialize the encounter.<br>
<br>
The original spell statistics for mana, duration and recast time were perfect. Thunder of Karana would have found good but not unbalancing use in raid scenarios as well as regular fights in places like Sebilis or Karnor's Castle. The resist levels were well balanced for single or chained use of the spell. The only thing 'wrong' with it is the component that prohibited the mob from doing special attacks like AoE's, Breaths and procs. (Dragon roar comes to mind). <br>
<br>

---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
From there we discussed different implementations that would allow AoE breath weapons and procs to continue, but regular spells like Complete Heal and Gate to be silenced. We understand these special attacks of dragons are coded as spells similar to any other spell.<br>
<br>
In the selection of the approach we tried to find a method that would not require extensive programming, reviewing each mob's spell selection or time intensive flagging of mobs and spells that can be silenced.

<br>
There are a few approaches that could be used to restrict the repertoire of a silenced mob's spells to only AoE or proc weapons without excessive implementation cost. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    a)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Restrict the spell list of a silenced dragon to only spells that:<br>
<br>
o have a cast time of less than 1 second <br>
o have zero mana cost<br>
<br>
In other words, Thunder of Karana would only silence spells that have a casting time greater than 1 second (AE's and procs are instant), and cost mana (So skills like Lay hands, Harm touch, and death touch will still be able to be cast).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    b)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Lower the channeling skill of a dragon by 95% when the dragon is silenced. This would similarily to restricting the spell selection list allow fast casting AoE weapons and procs to succeed but gates and complete heals to be interrupted.<br>

ToK should stop spellcasting, not special abilities that obiously aren't spells.  LOH, Dragon Breath, Death Touch, etc...these are not spells that are cast by incantation, they are inate abilities.  Don't think we all care HOW it's done, just make it so silence cancels spells not abilities that don't require speech <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I go relatively close to the implementation ideas since it will get programmers to think if that works or not, or maybe spawn their creative juices to come up with a working solution.<br>
<br>
Just trying to lay the way for them as much as we can with our knowledge we have of the spell system and engine. Some things are rather easy to guess how it is implemented when you see that all dragon special effects such as AoE are in the spell book.<br>

Bein able to debuff channeling would be useful. It would have to be enough to noticably increase interrupts on tha target. Like setting channeling to between a 0 and 10 flat skill.<br>
<br>
Ah also think inducing extended casting, recovery, or recast times on spells be interesting. So tha dragon wants to roar or cast CH? Now it's spell takes +6 seconds to cast, or +6 seconds to recover from, or +6 to 12 seconds to recast. Each of those adds a different flavor of impedement that can affect only one or all spell abilities. <p>Wulfhere Hausakliufr<BR>

I would guess it would also be a MUCH easier change to code than checking spell cast times, after all, they have all these new items with skill bonuses, so they have the skill bonus alteration routine already written.  That means debuffing channeling won't require any extra work on the part of their programmers (who must be swamped fixing SoL bugs as it is).<br>
<br>
In addition, a six second channeling debuff (-90% or -95%) should reduce channeling to between, say 13 and 26.  What chance do you have of channeling through a single hit with a channeling skill of 26 even?  I don't think I regained concentration and continued casting until I hit 50 or better in channelling.<br>
<br>
BUT, and here's the key part to the channeling debuff, that shouldn't prevent zero cast time spells from going off.  For example, you can LOH even with a lousy channelling skill.  HT and procs probably land with lousy channelling.  And if you aren't getting hit at all, then you can still cast, even with zero channelling.  If AE breath weapons and innate abilities function as skills (like LOH), then debuffing channeling is the answer, IF mob channeling checks are handled similarly to ours. <p>Aragir Lancot<BR>

i wouldnt believe 12 people killing sontalak unless i saw it, or a very reputable guild said they did it...<br>
<br>
i mean... its about a 100k mob...who dispells his buffs if he can cast..<br>
<br>
ok.. <br>
<br>
so you want it toK'd all the time,  ok.... youd need about 4 paladins minium then leaving 8 people<br>
<br>
off hand i dont recall exactly how debuffed he must be for slows, but to be safe i'd assume you would need the following classes:<br>
you'd need a warrior, i assume a shaman to get its ars slowed...probably a chanter for haste/c2..... bard for occulsion..leaving 4 more people..... which i'd assume would be clerics. at least 3 of...<br>
<br>
you would have to get ToK to land basically every time, because once he's not tok's he'd gonna be dispelling the MA and his debuffs as well... i find it very unlikely 5 melee  (ok 6 if you count bard) being able to take out a 100k mob w/o mistiming a tok, or getting a resist...i suppose it would be possible to miss a tok and him not dispell his buffs in the time for the next one, but if sont dispelled himself just once, my guess is it would be all over for those 12.... because he'd be back to quadding unslowed for 450ish (not  abig deal) but those 600+ procs with flurry tend to own people very fast.<br>
<br>
i just dont see it being a very doable thing with 12 people.... now 20ish... that would be another story.. =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utaliewin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taliewin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/13/01 12:57:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Submission Made</span><hr size=1> OK,<br>

Maybe the intent was never to have PvP, but the fact is that is there now. Maybe there aren't as many of us as there are in PvE but that doesn't mean we should be disregaurded simply because you don't play it. We pay the same money you do. The spell should benifit the whole Paladin comunity, not just the majority. On a different thread you commented on getting the shaft as a Paladin, why is it you wouldn't mind the PvP Paladins getting shafted? <p>Patryck

I mean it is not like PvP don't have PvE as well.  Or are high end raids non-existent on these servers? <br>
If they are then that is a fault of the PvP system, and it should not be allowed to inhibit those of us who can high end raid to not have a spell/ability for that.  If PvPer's do high end raid then it is a gain for everyone.  <br>
<br>
The whole reason this spell is being discussed is the benefit it can bring to Paladins on high end raids, if we want a spell that increases PvP effectiveness then that should be a separate issue.  Please don't add one issue to another.<br>

<br>
taliewin said it how i meant it. if a spell would benefit us PvE'ers, then it should not be turned down because it doesn't work against PvP. the game was intended to be PvE, therefore i feel wether is works in PvP is irrevelant, because the game wasn't created or balanced with PvP in mind. i think they should have seperate pvp skills/spells for jsut the pvp servers, cause it's a totally different world.<br>
<br>
i didn't mean it to come out that pvp pallys should get the shaft if it helps pve pally's, i just think that since the game was designed with pve in mind, that negative effects from pvp shouldn't affect us pve'ers, if that made any sense.<br>

Wulfhere, what resistance checks for MR does have a chance on pvp? Pretty much lure type only? <br>
<br>
Just wondering if you ever stick stun/root in the typical pvp encounter. <p><H3>Senchy Solariatus</H3>

This includes just aboot e'ery offensive or crowd control spell we have that ya might want ter cast in pvp... Root, Enstill, stuns (Cease, Desist, Stun, Holy Might), Flash of Light, and wards (vs undead pets).<br>
<br>
To resist these spells 50% o tha time requires only 60 magic resist. To resist them aboot 80% of tha time requires only 75mr. To resist them 95% o tha time requires only aboot 90mr. All paladin spells ifn not resisted will break almost instantly with that much resistance.<br>
<br>
Most o ma offensive spells be resisted 90% o tha time now a days. This has come to limit paladins as weak offensive warriors who can heal, cure and dispell themselves to some degree in pvp encounters on tha Zeks.<br>
<br>
Paladins have no innate way to do range damage from 30th to 50th crew and Flame of Light, which gets partial damage like typical DD spells. In tha mid ranks oor bow skill be too low to actually hit even a naked caster with regularity.<br>
<br>
Ah would like to see 1 or 2 spells in tha 49+ range that would help that situation some and provide worthwhile offensive or crowd control choices to tha paladin class. So far we have received nothing for oor lost defensive abilities from Poe's Stacking Rule.<br>
<br>
ToK and QWoT both could be made suitable for pvp ifn their resist rates would allow them to land. Ah believe capable pvp players and UNBUFFED uber beasties tend to have similar resistances in tha low to mid 100s (like 125mr etc). So a spell designed to help in uber raids and in pvp would need to have Lure 1 or 2 resistance. Certainly no worse than magic+0.<br>
<br>
QWoT indeed be havin magic+0 resistance but high mana cost and low dmg return make it unsuitable for most anything. Ah repreat in this thread that it should have aboot tha same stats as cleric Sound of Force with a recast delay. Instead we continue to get tha triple penalized cleric spell variations.<br>
