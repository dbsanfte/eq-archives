I have played almost all classes above level 20...1st toon level 20 dwarf cleric..*yawn* extremely boring. next was a halfling druid that at the time I did not know how to play the class and did not like it. I thought I was a meleer and so you get the picture he was level 21. Troll shaman level 15 *yawn* more boring stuff. DE warrior level 20 NO hp NO str got wasted. *should have made an Troll *love that regen* Most played toon Taiggy level 33 DE necro. For you warriors out there.. example of how druids are not the ALL super class you seem to think they are. I'm at the recently upgraded paw outside. I was level 28 and a druid was level 28 and he was trying to kill a gnoll. Now, I see him try to snare, gnoll  resists. The gnoll *I swear these are faster than sow* catches him and starts to beat him bad. Snare again resist again, same old same old. poor druid *a friend btw* runs over asking for help I *level 28 necro* say &quot;sure&quot; darkness, pet, fear gnoll dead I didn't get a scratch... hmmmm same level same gnoll I kill it easy Druid can't because of resists. If I get resisted pet steps in..the druid does not have this same luxury unless he has charmed a critter but this is risky becuase if charm breaks druid has 2 pissed off mobs after them.  <BR>  <BR> These gnolls are blue btw..same place same levels. Troll warrior shows up about level 30, 29 maybe. pulls a gnoll with bow whack whack whack gnoll dead troll barely scratched....hmmmm YES he had nice equipment with high dex and agil. So what happened here? These are pretty high levels late twenties 30ish people...Yes if the druid is not resisted he/she can snare dot run and med maybe..but with everything(mobs) at this level being faster than sow usually how does the druid stand up? IF spells are not resisted then you have a pretty easy fight even with yellows...reds no way not after patch I'm sorry I have watched to many high level 40+ druids die to trying to fight reds after patch. PLEASE PLEASE for the sake of this great game stop., STOP whinning and bitching about how &quot;my class sucks compared to this class&quot; Just because a necro can summon a pet should a warrior be able to? NO that is NOT Role-playing nor is it the way in this &quot;World&quot; we are in that it is supposed to be...Druids get sow and teleport..fine warriors do not..shamans get sow why are you not complaining they are too powerful..I have seen shamans at 34+ with pets do some amazing things that druids and necros even could not becuase of debuffs and such. Necro/druid + shaman/enchanter combo WOW!!!! <BR>  <BR> If you feel your class does not &quot;stand up&quot; to the rest then ask what can be done to IMPROVE your class not bring the rest down.

Heck (edited for you youngens out there) I even run around giving it to anyone I see even other druids who seem to be memming (why? heh less mana burned by them).  But there is this one situation that really ticked me one day and added a little halfing to my list of non buffing.  I was level 15 fighting a caimen in Oasis and I had it down to about 75%. Along came this halfling and started attacking my caimen.  She took it out quite quickly and I never got the experience for it (she was dealing out way more damage then me)  Then turned to me and said &quot;well now that you aren't busy SoW me' huh?! You just walked up stole my kill and expect me ME Ginian to give you a SoW.  'If you don't I will take all your kills'  Well little did she know but I was in a group and they were just resting by the docks and I decided to go after a caimen.  So I told her just try and then the rest of my group  consisting of a Paladin, an Enchanter,  and a dwarf cleric walked up.  I think it is this that makes alot of druids really act they way they do so remember just be polite.  I can't speak for all druids (there are some twits out there who don't deserve to carry the honorable name of druid ) but if you are polite you will almost always be able to get buffs for free.<br>

I am a druid lvl 46.I know what it is like to be bugged for Sow and tp', All i ask is to think about this.By the time i can think of a smart answer to tell them no about SoW i could have already mem'd it Sow'd them and rememd my other spell.As far a tp's i wont always do that, I can lose spawn and time.It is a bother at times but i know i like to get clarity everyonce and a while, and you know they get bugged just as much as we do.All i'm saying is it isnt worth the time to explain to them why you wont do it,It takes less time to just do it.I will say i draw a line at the one who then hunts around you and bugges you everytime his runs out.That gets annoying.<br>

And people have to wonder why druids get bitter?  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but if I see &quot;plz&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;ne 1&quot; &quot;SoW&quot; &quot;thx&quot; or any other abbreviation in there for a buff or word in your request, it's an automatic no.  If you can't take the time to type out your request politely, I don't have the time to help you.  I'm not asking for people to make huge requests like..  &quot;Please fair druid, could you grant me the spirit of wolf so that I might get my corpse?&quot;..  all I'd like to see is, &quot;Could you give me spirit of wolf please&quot; and it's as good as done.  If you make the request a command (i.e. sow me) you just hit my ignore list and you'll be there until I forget why I put you there.  <br>
<br>
I've done GG's and Buffs for free LOTS of times.. hell when I was lvl 39 and just got my new spells I went to G-fay and spent an entire week on &quot;orc hill&quot; buffing and healing people..gating people that wanted it.  It isn't like I'm some heartless bugger, but if you're asking me to be polite and nice in giving you a buff, I expect the request to be equally nice and polite.  <br>
<br>
I've seen a thread like this come up so many times it isn't even funny.  I seriously think that all those people that don't play druids and say &quot;Well if I were a druid I'd SoW everyone that asked me to and I'd teleport people for free and blah blah blah&quot; would be singing a different tune after a few months when they saw how much CRAP we have to put up with.  <br>
<br>
Druids may very well indeed be one of the most powerful and/or versitile classes in EQ, but I think we're also one of the most begged, pestered, and verbally abused so excuse the hell out of me if I don't feel like being charitable after being non-stop begged and yelled at for the past 4 hours I've been logged in. <p><p align="center"><strong><font color="#0000FF" face="Helvetica">Chassaria Mindreaver - 55

  I have a 39th monk and in all 39 levels have never once paid for a SoW,port,bind,buffs, etc. I have always offered to pay of course but it has been declined every time. I even have people going out of their way to help me out when I /ooc for something.You probably think I'm lying :) I'm not. Here's my secret.<br>
 I roleplay and ask politely. Instead of &quot;sow me plz&quot; I will emote/examines her feet for puppies, /sigh, /plead target. Or if I /ooc for something it would be &quot;Me poor lettle feetz iz not stuck to da ground :(  Kin anybudy stick me feetz? Perty pleez!!&quot;   (She's a half troll monk.Long story) <br>
 People run to help me just because I put some imagination and effort into my request. I should thank all the idiot beggers. Their rude demands make my requests look unique.<br>
 BTW, I also have a 51st druid so I know how annoying people can be. Remember, druids get all these annoying demands because we rock! Those poor, sowless, one zone campin, buffless beggers NEED Druids. Demand politeness but remember, our buffs and sow have saved more lives, not to mention time and effort, for people than every cleric that has ever been born. People get demanding because they are desperate for what we have. Take pity on the poor sods :)<br>

That to me seems a little ungrateful and can be a little annoying. <br>
I can understand some druids getting a little snappy when they get asked for a port or buffs every time they zone. I usually give what I think is a polite response if I am busy. But I have to say, I am never too busy for the giving of a simple sow. Personally, I always have it memmed. The only times I wouldn't give a sow is if I am asked for it rudely, or if the person is not even in the zone. ;)  <br>

A druid joined us and after 2 kills he left saying experience was too slow.  Bear in mind this was a twinked warrior and rogue and the crocs were dying fast.  Within 15minutes of going to solo he had yelled for help on three seperate occassions, I do believe he died also.  O well :)<br>

<br>
I get annoyed with the ones who can't spell out &quot;please&quot; but oh well, they learned how to type using AOL chat.<br>
<br>
I get PISSED at the ones who ask while I'm in the middle of a kite and then get mad at ME because I don't SOW then right then.  Even these times I tell them &quot;One minute...kiting&quot; and not flame them.<br>
<br>
I played a Ranger for 48 lvls before I restarted as a Druid so I know what it is like without having Bind or Port...but you know what, when I needed these things I always asked politely and donated when able.<br>
<br>
Ask nicely and you may be surprised at the response.  Quit being a whiner when you don't get SOW from me when you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;SOW me!&quot;<br>
&quot;SOW plz&quot;<br>
&quot;Hey D00d SOW me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Try &quot;Tallithain, may I please have a SOW when you are able?&quot;<br>
<br>
Hotkey /s %T, may I please have a SOW when you are able?<br>
<br>
It isn't that f'n hard...I'll even do it for free when asked like that.<br>
<br>
I'll be damned if I go &quot;Clarity me Chanter!&quot;  or &quot;Taunt it you f'n Warrior!&quot;  I show other people respect, and all I ask is respect in return.<br>

<br>
A good friend of mine, he's a wizzie, loves clarity, and he generally pays for it if he have to, 5-10 plats, and he always offers to pay if he sends a tell directly to the chanter.<br>
<br>
Personally, it's nice to have, but I can do without. My point is, sow costs what? 40 mana, well, Clarity costs 35 mana, and people are a lot more willing to pay for that than to pay for sow. Or a rez, I almost always give 50pp's for it if I can afford it, it costs them 700 mana, if I recall correctly, a port costs us 300 mana, and we are forced to zone twice, maybe bind and gate and later move our bind point back where we wanted it, which, all in all costs me a lot more time than what it costs the cleric doing the rez.<br>
<br>
Yet, our spells, or services if you will, are unappreciated and expected to be given at no or low cost to anyone who asks. To me, the more polite a person is, the more likely they are to get what they want, and maybe a few extra buffs before they leave. If I get a rez, I always SoW the cleric afterwards, if I do buy or get a clarity, SoW for the chanter, and<br>
if I got it up or are not in a hurry, SLN.<br>
<br>
While you think about this, all I want are politeness, I don't care about cash, I always refuse cash for SoW, the people who offer cash are the people I want to SoW anyway.<br>
<br>
Ports are a little different, but I generally decline cash offered nowadays, that is, unless I'm doing it for the cash. If I'm heading to the same zone as someone, or they have been shouting for a port for a while and appear to be polite, I will offer to port them for free.<br>
<br>
But in the end, it is my time, it is my mana, it is up to me to decide what to do with it.<br>

Running across a zone to SoW someone I just wont do unless its its very much needed i.e corpse run. Ports I have stopped doing unless I am doing absolutly nothing. None druids have no idea how annoying it is when you just get settled into a camp or just get to the zone you wanted to be in and then have 6 people send you tells saying can you port me? Even by friends it get annoying quickly. Sometimes I just want to log on and go do my own thing. I hate saying no to people but you are interrupting our hunting time. I have let guild mates play my druid and they always say, &quot; I cant believe how many tells I got for ports.&quot; I know there is always the option to roleplay or go anon but it doesnt work people still find me, maybe they see me with my epic or know my name and know I'm a druid who knows. I dont care about the money for ports or SoW's  I always refuse it.  When I play I just want to play not port every unknown person on my server for the next hour. Whats really not fair is that I do go out of my way to help people all the time and when Im too busy to do it I can attitude from people. There are plenty of druids on every server if the first one you ask says no try another dont argue with the druid or keep pestering them just move on. Just my 2 cents..<br>

<br>
For instance,<br>
<br>
About a week ago.. I was playing around in Najena..  no one was around for a while  so I figured I'd go play with Rathyl a bit.. maybe get a travelers pack.. or hit up Najena herself..  well .. along comes a young rogue..  I feel like being a nice guy .. so I SLN, Chloro, Str, DS ..   everything is going great until I sit down to med about a half hour later.. and I get a tell from the guy..<br>
<br>
youngrogue01 tells you, &quot;Hey I'm going to die can help me&quot;<br>
<br>
I get up and look around for him  and find him standing pretty close to the zone fighting..   I walk up and blast one mob.<br>
<br>
so now he's half health..  fighting one mob who is also half health..   the mob is a mage caster..    <br>
<br>
I figure he's going to live right..    well all of a sudden some how several mobs who do not even belong near the room he was in   appear  and start to beat on him..  <br>
<br>
I say &quot;Better zone... !&quot;<br>
<br>
He doesn't ...<br>
<br>
I say &quot;Zone.. I'm LOM&quot;<br>
<br>
He keeps fighting..  <br>
<br>
Right as he's about to die.. <br>
<br>
Youngrogue01 tells you, &quot;SoW me so I can run out of here&quot;<br>
<br>
as we all know Najena is an underground dungeon..<br>
<br>
well to make a long story, even longer..<br>
<br>
He dies.. and I now have 12 greenies beating on me with no mana..  so I head for the zone  .. probably 50 ft.    <br>
<br>
sorry for the rant..  and I applaud any of you who could understand it all..<br>
