Fields upon fields of wild flowers and the ever-lasting scent of vitality and freshness, the kind of aromatic bliss only achieved by nature at its peak. <br>
<br>
It was here that Kelwyn spent most of his time, laying under his elm tree, along the tiny slope of a hill near the large expanse of the lake there. The leaves on the tree were in full bloom and were creatung the perfect amount of shadow for Kelwyn to laze in. His hands were up above his head, and one of his legs were bent up, his chest rising and falling in the rhythmic pattern of sleep.<br>
<br>
A slight russle in the grass at the bottom of the hill aroused him from his sleep, but he barely moved, the more wary would have noticed that his left eye cracked open slightly.<br>
<br>
She cared not however and moved closer, circling the hill, watching him sleeping. The soft pattern of running feet sounded suddenly and a short leap brought Ariannda to her husband's side.<br>
<br>
Kelwyn loved this game and his right hand sprang up and caught her hip, his left hand carrying a dagger and arcing it around for the kill. Ariannda eyes never left Kelwyns and she smiled as the dagger closed in. Stopping the blade just an inch from her neck, Kelwyns eyes gazed back, and Ariannda, not missing a beat slowly brought the blade up to her lips and kissed the edge twice, smiling at Kelwyn playfully.<br>
<br>
His stone gaze melted away instantly and he tossed his head back and laughed, throwing the dagger away. Leaning forward, Ariannda wrapped her arms around Kelwyn and bit his neck in yet another playful gesture. His laughing cut short and a wail escaping his lips, wrapping his own arms around his wife, rolling her over so she was beneath him, growling at her now, a feral animosity surging forth. Ariannda leaned up and kissed him passionately, getting ready to begin a new game, one they both loved playing.<br>
<br>
Laying underneath the tree again, with his hands up over his head and staring up at the clouds. Ariannda lay her head upon his naked chest, her arms drapped around his mid-section, also staring up at the clouds. They were debating wether or not it looked like a dragon or a horse. Laughing and joking the day away, neither of them could see the black storm clouds gathering behind them.<br>
<br>
Looking down at Ariannda, smiling at her sweetly, Kelwyn breathed a sigh of relief and licked his lips. Looking up at Kelwyn, smirking at him mischieviously, Ariannda breathed her own sigh of relief and said to Kelwyn, &quot;I love you,&quot;.<br>
<br>
Rather than smile, a dark and foreboding feeling came over Kelwyn as his lips tightened and he looked at her with scorn. Screaming with fright at the unexpected action, Kelwyn stood and the sudden force and speed of it almost threw Ariannda down the hill.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hate it when you do that, you use that word without a care in the world, you dont even know what it means,&quot;. Kelwyn began to walk towards the lake, Ariannda on her knees at the other side of the hill with an absolutely confused and astonished look on her face. &quot;I dont understand Kelwyn, whats wrong ?,&quot; she called out to him but he just waded into the water and stood knee deep in it, then turning his head he looked over his shoulder at her and sneered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course you do not understand, a human never could, such a base and idiotic race, without a care in the world, surrounded by evils and not even seeing it,&quot; he began to kick the water and Ariannda rose to her feet and began to walk slowly towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't come near me,&quot; he lifted his arm to stop her but she didnt, &quot;You who use love without even knowing its meaning. Its a disease, a horrid cancer transmitted from person to person. People say it is a happiness, supreme bliss......HA!!! It is a curse dragging people from there true place and caging them in suspended animation,&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I.....I dont....,&quot; Ariannda half turned her head around, and could see the storm clouds approaching behind her. Kelwyn began to hug himself, the nails on his fingers digging into the flesh on his arms, tiny droplettes of blood began to slide down his skin. Ariannda looked on in horror as a familiar red aura began to envelope Kelwyn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love is a weapon, used to cause pain and suffering, a tool that can bring kings and gods to their knees,&quot;. Kelwyn began to scream out now, staring up at the sky as if there were more spectators then just Ariannda and himself. His fingers delved deeper into his arms, the wounds opening wider, the blood running down his biscep, stopping at his elbows and falling into the water.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love is a wolf in sheeps clothing, gaining your trust and entering your life, making you feel like your in heaven,&quot; closing his eyes and bending his head he whispered one last verse of his morbid poem &quot; before it sends you screaming to hel,&quot;. Tearing away at his arms, the blood pouring out of the cut now, a horrific fountain of black gore turning the entire lake a darkness impenitrible. The red aura had now engulfed Kelwyn completely, forming a pillar, reaching up into infinity, yelling out, a testimony to his hatred, and his denial of love.<br>
<br>
Ariannda looked on in absolute despair, tears streaming down her face, not knowing what to do or how to react to the sudden and now violent change in her husband. Walking steadily towards him now, the clouds above creating a storm both thick and deadly, the rain beating down at the ground harder then she could bear to stand. As she got closer her eyes blurred and she stopped and closed them, to clear herself and to regain her composure. While they were closed she saw images, glimpses of time spent with Kelwyn. Laying under the tree with him, having breakfast in there mansion in freeport, sitting on the railing of a boat at night with him, star-gazing and kissing him tenderly. <br>
<br>
These visions came to her with a soft and gentle voice, at first she couldnt make it out, but the voice was asking her if she loved the dark elf in her mind, the one she had an undeniable bond to. &quot;Of course.&quot; she cried out, as if the question was absurd, the sound of distinct laughter could be heard, and the voice apologized, wondering how it could ever be mistaken. Ariannda was almost at her wits end, when the voice released her and she was back in the raging storm, the whispering message of &quot;go to him&quot;.<br>
<br>
Looking down at her hands, palm up, Ariannda didnt know what to think. Her hands were.....were radiating with a green light, and she no longer felt the stinging of the rain or the despair. No, she had a power now, one to combat whatever evil had taken her husband. Eyes set grim with purpose, she grit her teeth and ran, determined to see this through.<br>
<br>
Rushing up behind Kelwyn she threw her arms around him, clasping his waist with no intention of letting go. Yelling out for him to &quot;Please stop, Kelwyn, just....stop,&quot; her eyes becomming teary again, and as one dropped from her glistening cheek, something happened. <br>
<br>
She was flung again to another dimension, this time surrounded by a black abyss, nothingness all around, well almost all around. To her left, Kelwyn sat on the ground, his legs drawn up to his chest, his arms wrapped around them, he was crying and wanted to be shut out from the world. Walking up, Ariannda slowly knelt down and touched Kelwyn on the shoulder. Wincing he looked up hesitantly and she could see tears running down his face, there eyes meeting, and Kelwyn spoke, in what Ariannda could tell was his own voice &quot; I dont want to be alone,&quot; and he was about to bury his face in self-pity again, but this time Ariannda took his chin in her hand and raised his head up to look at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You never will be, my love.&quot; Ariannda said, and with that she leaned down and kissed Kelwyn, and he kissed her back, the two embracing in the bond of lovers. In that instant, the blackness faded and the red and green auras were gone, the lake was its turned back to pristine blue shine and the sky was marble white with birds singing, and the two of them, were back under the elm tree.<br>
<br>
Laying underneath the tree again, with his hands up over his head and staring up at the clouds. Ariannda lay her head upon his naked chest, her arms drapped around his mid-section, also staring up at the clouds. They were debating wether or not it looked like a dragon or a horse. Laughing and joking the day away, neither of them could see the black storm clouds receding behind them.<br>
<br>
Looking down at Ariannda, smiling at her sweetly, Kelwyn breathed a sigh of relief and licked his lips. Looking up at Kelwyn, smirking at him mischieviously, Ariannda breathed her own sigh of relief and said to Kelwyn, &quot;I love you,&quot;.<br>
<br>
Kelwyn looked at Ariannda and his eyes gleamed with undying love.<br>
<br>
&quot;I love you too Ari,&quot;.<br>
