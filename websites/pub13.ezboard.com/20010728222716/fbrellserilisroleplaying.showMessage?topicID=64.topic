I trust this letter has found you safely and without incident.  The mail routes can be treacherous by themselves, and many volunteer carriers choose to pursue adventuresome and perilous excursions before committing to delivery.  Still, should this letter be lost or intercepted I doubt it would be of interest to anyone, save you I assume.  Or perhaps Uncle Willaen.<br>
<br>
I am well.  My studies in music are progressing slowly.  I still have difficulty maintaining posture while playing brass instruments.  But I find that my skill with stringed instruments has sharply increased as I better understand how to strum with plate armor over my fingers.  As always however, it is difficult to judge my skill when every ghoul and orc criticizes me with the blunt end of a staff.<br>
<br>
I recently ventured to the north of Antonica, and to Halas itself.  A very impressive township.  It is cold there, but the natural beauty of the snow and the freshness of the air can be quite inspiring.  I found I had to frequently clear my boots of snow and slush, even though I often sang the aria of eagles to lift me above the ground in my travelling.<br>
<br>
You would have liked the colors there for your paintings.  But as always there were dangers around.  Your decision to stay close to home when I left was wise in this respect, although I know the Crushbone orcs don't allow you perfect sanctuary among the trees either.<br>
<br>
I hope you are well.  The last I heard of you was the last time I passed through Kelethin.  A guard told me you had journeyed to the high elf city in search of some wasp sting balm.  Willaen did not speak of you, though I suspect he has come to treat me as simply another stranger in his busy life.  Despite his considerable aptitude with numbers and quantities, I suspect even he has lost count of the number of his customers over the years.  I hope he will not let such overwhelming tedium dull his soul.  But with his love for you I suspect he will endure as all wood elves do.<br>
<br>
I do regret arguing with him so many times.  I know he believed I was deserting him and you and mother Tunare.  I suspect even you believed that to some degree, but all I could do at the time was not deny myself my own beliefs, and hope I can one day prove to you and Willaen and all of Kelethin the value of the path I've undertaken.<br>
<br>
To be honest, following Tunare would be a lot simpler than following Quellious the Tranquil.  The teachings of the Tranquil suggest, among other things, that it is one's own potential that is important.  So to follow Quellious means to not follow Quellious but to follow oneself.  Some days the contradictions are numbing, and I sometimes yearn for a simple directive like 'tender the oaks and mother Tunare will be happy'.<br>
<br>
But I can't accept the idea of handing my soul over to any elf or god any more now than I could when I first left Kelethin.  I do desperately hope you can understand this zala.  I would hope your father would also understand but I doubt it.  I don't even know if I'm simply a fool and my beliefs are worth nothing, but I can't dismiss the belief in my own potential.  I can't believe my soul is something insubstantial, nothing more than a simple seed on a branch that requires a forest god to nuture into something special but only if she is in the mood to do so.<br>
<br>
I do not mean to disparage, only to acknowledge that Tunare like any god has too little time to truly be devoted to each and every elf that devotes himself to her.  And I believe that in each of us lies something amazing and unique that can be grown and revealed without lordly favor.<br>
<br>
These are bold words I know.  Especially since I have so far failed to demonstrate these ideas even to myself.  But I think I have an idea now on how to do it.<br>
<br>
Right now I am generally sharing camp with many adventurers in the old Guk ruins.  There is an unnerving infestation of undead Frogloks in this area, and I have been training my skills on the least fearsome of the horde.  Now don't furrow your brow like you always do zala.  I am being careful to avoid as much danger as I can.  However, from time to time I find I am descended upon by more foes than I can handle.  And as I have been overwhelmed by a force all my shiny armor cannot blunt nor my deadly weapons cannot cut down I have found that my physical self becomes slowly paralyzed by the fear of defeat I have always known.  Thankfully in these situations honorable adventurers have pitched in to save me so far.<br>
<br>
But it dawns on me that if my own potential within me is being superceded by my own mortal nature, then by suspending the mortal aspects of my physical being I should be able to free my soul to act with the full force of my potential, and thus prove my beliefs to be true.  As my own fear is the only mechanism I have to paralyze my physical being, I may have to venture to the heart of my fear alone to find the truth, whether it be that I have a soul or whether it be that I am a fool as Willaen has often said.<br>
<br>
Now please zala, although this likely will give you cause to worry about me, please realize that I intend to take this idea slowly.  I will properly seek out research from the farthest reaches of Norrath before I decide whether such a confrontation is indeed my destiny or not.  I will learn to play that waltz on the flute you love so much first.  I will consider the matter with the wit uncle said I inherited from my mother.  But I beg of you zala to realize that I will also challenge my destiny with the courage uncle said I inherited from my father whatever my destiny may be.<br>
<br>
But if I am a fool zala, it means a lot to this fool that you've been so kind to me throughout my life.  More than I had reason to expect.<br>
<br>
And If I am a fool, please remember me as a true elf.<br>
<br>
Thank you zala,<br>
