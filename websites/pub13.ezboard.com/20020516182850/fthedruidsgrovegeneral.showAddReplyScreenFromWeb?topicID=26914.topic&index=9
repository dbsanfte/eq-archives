I chose druid over wizard because I was looking for something that could solo with ease, plus the foraging skill is nice because I work many trades where foraged items are needed.  Track is sweet too if you need to locate specific mobs in a zone.  Another reason I chose druid over wizard was the location of the ports...druid port locations are in better areas to be honest.  Surefall Glade is a much nicer  starting point than NK if you're heading to Permafrost.<br>
<br>
There's an additional perc of being able to powerlevel with a druid.  The damage shields combined with the other buffs make the druid a fantastic PLer.  Oh and, let's just say your main isn't exactly a soloing class, and you just need a heal now and again to take down a blue...a helpful druid waiting in the wings can help a lot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=felessan>Felessan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/31/02 1:45:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26914.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Started as a druid, never felt the need for an alt until my early 50s, at which point I got sick of looking for a seb group and started a rogue.<br>

 Played him till about 2 months into Kunark getting to 35 or so then quit EQ for AC. Came back when SoV came out and played only the druid. The warrior got used very rarely when the guild was short of tanks and he's now 52, 50 pre-kunark to 52 post SoL must be a record. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm a little in and out lately (mild burnout) but if I had the chance to change I'd prolly go for a shaman. Close enough to be familiar and with much fewer problems at the top end, not saying they have no problems but much fewer. <p><div align="center"><a href="http://pub96.ezboard.com/bmagusamicitia"><img src="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/redcelt/magus/sig_deneldar_58.jpg" width="450" height="150" border="0"></a></div>

My shammy has problems groups but a LOT less than my druid ever has.  Havent played a tank in the endgame but plan to have mine to 50s in about a month.<br>

I LOVE playing the druid class.  If it ever gets to the point that druids are NEEDED (not just tolerated) in the endgame then I will proably dust tarrwin off and let him be my main.  until then, hes pretty much retired.<br>

<br>
1. Change their class from a Druid to another character/class.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Started my druid in Aug 99.  Got past 50 and hated the game, so switched to my monk in Jan 01.  Now I mainly play my monk on raids and for experience, and the druid when questing or working tradeskills (or as a powerlevel bot)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Used their Druid to power their now Main Character/class on another account.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The day the service became available, I paid the $50 to switch my monk off my main account expressly for these purposes.  At the time of the switch the monk was 48, so it's not like she was powerleveled her entire life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   To me that was the best $50 I ever spent.  Now my main char has a quick way to join guild raids when I log in late.  I can get an instant group when I only have 45 mins to play and want a bit of experience, etc.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Powered a Druid on another account to give their melee/non-gating class ability to travel.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I started to do this, but then deleted it and made a wizard instead.  The reason I wanted a porter on my 2nd account is that I noticed all my new chars were appearing on my second account simply because I had the druid on the other account to port.  My second account is now full, but I have open slots on my main account.  So I wanted to start making twinks there and still have a porter available.  This of course doesn't take into account my 3rd account...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please list your main class now, any reasons of which you felt you needed to change your class. Basically why did you change from a Druid to your class you are using now. If things were changed (improved) would you come back? IE: Did you like being a Druid?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I loved being a druid up to the mid 40s.  We could melee somewhat, had great spell variety, could fill almost any role in a group, etc.  Mid 40s, mobs start hitting harder so melee is pretty much out.  Still we were wanted in most groups.<br>
<br>
Post 50 that changed.  Here's how I currently see my beloved druid:  Other classes buff better, so they get chosen over Khieran for pickup groups.  Other classes heal better, so they get chosen over Khieran.  Other classes nuke better, so they get chosen over Khieran.  Nobody evacs any more (or very rarely) so she's not needed for that.  Rangers snare, clerics root/park, shaman buff, wizards nuke.  Druids sit at the zone looking for a group.  I got tired of not getting a group, so I switched to my monk.<br>
<br>
There needs to be something for druids to do on raids other than cast Circles and heal a cleric once in a while.  I don't know what that role would be, but there needs to be something.  Sure, there are level 60 druids that are wonderful on raids and love every minute of being 60, etc.  But for 90% of the druid population, 55+ means solo'ing to 60 or not playing (from what I've seen).  The problem is, that you never need more than 1 druid on a big raid.  You only need 1 druid to Circle all the groups (with /targetg this is easy now).  You only need 1 druid to cast RFS if you use it, and it's probably the same druid that cast the Circles.  There's no reason for other druids on the raid.<br>
<br>
With every other class, with the exception of mage probably, it's a benefit having more than one on a raid.  But with druids, it's just more lag for very little added benefit.<br>
<br>
Raids get called off if there are no chanters, or no clerics, or no shaman available.  No druid?  Who cares?  The raid goes on.<br>
<br>
These are my own views of how I see the druid 55+ game.  I know there are others out there who disagree but this is how I see it.  Sobe asked for how we felt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;For those that have twink Druids (gatebotz), why a druid and not a wizard?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I had originally started a druid gatebot on my alt account, but I switched it to a wizard because of the desirability of wizards later in the game.  I figured I have played a druid to the upper levels and loathe it.  If by some chance my gatebot becomes a viable character, I'll make him a wizard so at least he'll be wanted in later levels.  No use having 2 druids that do nothing but PL and port twinks around.<br>
