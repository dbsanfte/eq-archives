<br>
Most guilds might only be up there to get the armor drops, but for some its a matter of the epic pieces aswell.<br>
<br>
Ever since I created ET we had a problem with the 24 hour spawn time on maestro in planes like plane of hate. Cause it doesnt pop when we are there we never really saw it unless the raid the day before failed him or we could stay up there to 6 am in the morning.<br>
<br>
With the way that all the new golems and mini-bosses are put on different days spawn its not going to be everyone that see them. I dont think it should be allowed by any guilds to go in between raids and clear out the rest of the plane. If this is allowed we might aswell FFA the planes as it would give everyone a fair chance instead of just few selected.<br>
<br>
What do everyone else think?<br>

If someone can go clear the rest of the plane without affecting repops for the next day that reduces the wasting of spawns.  Abyss went up to the 2nd floor of hate one night in between 2 raids I was attending.   They didn't kill any bosses just all the normal stuff that would repop before we got back up there the next day.   They got some loot, we still had all our mobs, everyone was happy.<br>
<br>
The situation with the bosses... thats a bit different.  Not really sure how to cover that because even if no one went in between raids Maestro is a push over and would still die evening US time and never be up in time for an ET raid.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 11:08:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need some rules about fear/hate.</span><hr size=1> Since all the &quot;minibosses&quot; etc can be cleared by vitually any guild that attempts them these days and are never up for him anyway, I'm guessing Lanos is trying to make an end run around the issue of the Gods, which was a contentious one lately.

<br>
We have a two week reservation system in place.  If we, as a community, prevent the larger guilds from being able to go in after a raid to kill these mobs, you will see larger guilds continue to reserve Fear and Hate regularly.<br>
<br>
I was under the impression that both zones are in high demand.  Forcing larger guilds to reserve the planes in order to kill one or two mobs will cause further strain on the system.  If we don't allow it, expect to see the reservation list expand to include every large guild on Brell, with multitudes of armor drops rotting.<br>

I have only been on 2 raids to Fear since the new CT.<br>
<br>
 The first time he was up we cleared Fear and went after him. <br>
<br>
 Well I went on a raid with some one else and they got stuck in pulling because the uber mobs was in the way. So they ask for help and help came and they finsh pulling Fear. <br>
<br>
 There are not to many indys/guilds that can take down the uber mobs so they ask for help or some indy/guild ask the raid leader if they can help out. <br>
<br>
 Its funny when the raid leader for that day says yes every one gets mad about it. Most of the guilds that have help out don't even ask for any of the drops. They even share the uber loot from what I have seen.<br>
<br>
 So, if we where to change the rules what will that help? NOTHING. All the raid leader needs to do is add indy/guild to there list. They what can you do? Ya still %%%%%.<br>
<br>
No one stops any one from asking the raid leader to come up to help out to get to the uber mobs.<br>
<br>
There is no reason why any one and I mean any one can't ask for help.<br>
<br>
I think it should be just left alone. It's up to the raid leader for the day if they want some indy/guild to come up there. It's not yours. If you make the changes you are telling the raid leaders how to run there raid. <br>
<br>
 If I was running a raid adn was stuck some where or some one gave me a tell to ask if I need help. You bet I would ask no matter what happens here. I needed it adn they came.<br>
<br>
BTW This has nothing to do with what guild I am in.

They can't help anyone else kill cazic because everyone else raids in US evenings, which is like midnight or later in europe and they don't have enough players online then.<br>

Kinda have a unique reason to complain, but I wouldn't expect anyone to care. Just as with the rest of brell, the greedy majority beats the greedy minority. Unless you go and do something about it, nothing will change.  In this thread your the greedy minority and the larger guilds on US timezones are the greedy majority.<br>

Just ignore my post if reasoning is wrong. I assumed you were trying to make a point about cazic.<br>

Problem is like sawen says there are no solution for it. Pretty much like there are no solution for asian players wanting to book hate/fear during their prime time or as someone pointed out ET's chance of seeing maestro regualy on our hate raids.<br>
<br>
I know this is a problem that only have 2 solutions where I dont like either of them but have to choose.<br>
<br>
1. I could live with the system as it is, and just try and get what I can. ET players that need something from mobs like maestro just have to find the days where they can stay up late and beg to be able to come on other raids.<br>
<br>
2. Screw the system and just ffa the planes, which would probably not let us see more mobs. But would be easier to plan raids on the days that suit us best(pretty much like PoG works right now).<br>
<br>
I dont like solution 2. for obivious reasons. But at some point in time its going to end up being the only solution that seem logic to any minority asian or european. <br>
<br>
&quot;A minority will only be noticed if they are able to make an impact on the majority. Both good and evil.&quot;<br>

Lanos, if you can't talk to raid leaders to get your own chance, I gotta say that's your problem, and noone else's. We don't know these people or have any prior relationship with them most of the time, we just open up discussions. <br>
<br>
NOTHING is preventing you from doing the same. NOTHING has dictated that we got any more chances than anyone else at the spawn. Your time factor has absolutely nothing to do with this issue, so bringing it up all the time is a red herring. <br>
<br>
Frankly, I think you oughtta put up or shut up. When you can honestly tell me you've approached raid leaders and they've shot you down because of our uber conspiracy to hog the spawn, I'll think you have something to worry about. Until then it just sounds like you are unwilling to work with anyone else and want it done for you so you don't have to put in the effort.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueoralsolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EoralSolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 1:09:07 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need some rules about fear/hate.</span><hr size=1> What thoric said.<br>

<br>
Second, using the word greed in any of these discussions belittles the debate contained within.  We're all guilty of the exact same wants and desires.  The difference is that some of us manage to attain those goals while others complain about not being able to.<br>
<br>
Now, let me try and take the high road.<br>
<br>
I understand your frustration Lanos.  Being in an almost opposite time zone prevents you from contacting the raid leaders because they're more than likely asleep while you're interested in killing the Gods.<br>
<br>
Are you proposing that we set up a rotation on the Gods so that all of the guilds get their fair share?  I've heard at least one member of Abyss propose the same thing, and while it sounds fair, I know what it will lead to.<br>
<br>
Let me show you an example:<br>
<br>
We'll have two reservation system for Fear.  One handles normal mobs as well as mini-bosses, while the other dictates who can kill Cazic provided he is up.<br>
<br>
You'll have the normal Fear raid, doing their thing, killing normal mobs.  Then, they'll sit there in front of Cazic and wonder why they have to stop.  Similar to your reasoning as to what Europa Tribes will have to do at some point, these raiders aren't going to sit still and leave the Gods up eventually.<br>
<br>
Also, who dictates who's allowed to sign up for these God rotations?  While I doubt we'll ever see a list as long as the previous Venril rotation, it is possible that we will see something larger than the current Trakanon list.  Considering that the Gods are on a seven day spawn cycle, and assuming that we'll have 11 guilds (SR, Watchers, Enshadowed, Europa Tribes, Clan Spiritslammer, Abyss, Skyre Draneth, Order of Eternity, Legion of Heroes, and Elysian)who all want a shot at the God, we're now talking about a minimum of a two month waiting list.  <br>
<br>
That two months assumes that guilds will kill him right when he spawns, and that they won't fail and require more days to try again.  Realistically, we're talking about a three month waiting period.<br>
<br>
That's unacceptable to me, and I know that it will be unacceptable to many others once they realize how long they're going to have to wait.  I think I can speak for everyone when I say that certain guilds are going to get irritated with the system and will ignore it eventually.  Rather than causing all the headache that is inevitable, the only solution is to not mess with a spawn that was designed to be FFA from the start.<br>
<br>
Honestly, at some point people are going to need to realize that there's just too many guilds on this server, all competing for the same resources, and the only way to effectively and fairly share those resources is to let the system created by the designers of the game to run its course.<br>
<br>
In-game communication is key.  If SR is able to work with raid leaders to make it happen, I don't see why any other guild on this server can't.  Personally, I think we're all a little too comfortable with a system that does things for us, giving us the rights to kill a certain mob when it's simply our turn.  It takes no effort and that is the reason why everyone will sign up for something once we've made it reservable.<br>
<br>
And lastly, I'll take the low road:<br>
<br>
&quot;Im getting tired of how some guilds are able to spin the rules on the fear and hate issue.&quot; - Lanos<br>
<br>
It's better than simply ignoring reservations completely.  Don't you agree? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uganonstormwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ganon Stormwynd</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.angelfire.com/il/selectevil/icons/Icon_Fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 4/27/01 1:31:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usawentrueblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sawen Trueblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 6:14:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> No more reservations thx, my posts were meant to say its tough luck, shoulda been more blunt.

<br>
On a side note, we killed cazic when we had the plane reserved for the day.  Fcfs on him works for me, but it is messed up due to being worked within a reserved environment.  <br>
<br>
Recently you guys killed him like a day before a watchers raid understandably upsetting them a little bit.  I'd bet you aren't going to do that again, but noone cares if you kill him before a day before an et raid right?  The first time sr joined a raid to kill him, I believe an sr member checked ahead with the raid leaders for the rest of the week. You don't need to, in my eyes its not the way the game is meant to be played, but people will undoubtably have frustrations if a mob they want to try is never up.  This board is the easiest place to let them out.<br>
<br>
I can see you guys have a point, its just that lanos does too. In reality ET can prolly work something out in game if they'd like cazic to be up so they can try him. Noone but the big guilds can kill cazic right now.  Just try a few tells in game instead of asking for more gay rules.<br>
<br>
As for ignoring reservations all together, atleast with no reservations the playing field is fair and it all comes down to ability and dedication.  Too much paranoia related to fcfs. Brell will never ever go ffa cause even the most ardent fcfs supporters (me) have no desire for ffa.<br>
<br>
For a few people out there - FFA AND FCFS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT !<br>

I remember a time, even 1 not so far back where the current raid had a chance for taking out the gods given their raid.  Some failed some were successful, but it was the time they signed up for and should have had a chance at it.  For  things that will not be up for the next raid I think its just weak to jump in there and finish off someones raid, I mean its like &quot;hmm we cant possibly finish this, so lets bump up our chance for some phat lewt and call in our big daddy to do it for us&quot;.  As far as hate goes and killing second floor mobs, no problem there the spawns will be up for the next raid<br>
<br>
The only way I would be totally content with people going in and finishing off the gods/ubermobs for someone elses raid is if they got consent from everyone else in the rotation until the respawn time.  There are at least 3 guilds that have killed the new uber gods, and it shouldnt be a popularity contest for them to get asked to finish someones raid for them.  What should be done? I wish I knew I know its wasteful to have a god up and wasted, but I think its even worse to not have those who are waiting their turns patiently on the lists to see someone jump their chance.<br>
<br>
D<br>
<br>
yes we did fear and yes cazic was already dead and we didnt get to test our mettle against him, even though he probaly would of done us in.<br>

The gods aren't reservable, they never have been. You have no right to them whatsoever. <br>
<br>
If you have a major yen to try him then by all means do so. Contact a raid leader the day he's up and ask if you can join forces to take down big ugly. All it takes is an email, or a tell, or a post on the board. You know when he's gonna be up a week in advance you should have plenty of time to contact the raid. <br>
<br>
I don't see why this is even a problem for people except that they are so used to having things handed to them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utinyntinagyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tinyn Tinagyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 276<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 2:20:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need some rules about fear/hate.</span><hr size=1> I think the issue is that you also know when the CT will pop, and will have contacted whoever 'owns' CT for that day. And that if the raid leader that day has to choose between letting SR kill CT, or letting ET try, he's afraid that every time its going to go to you instead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 4:31:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need some rules about fear/hate.</span><hr size=1> Well he at least ought to try now before he whines about it ought he not? <br>

I mean, just assuming we have this major hold over everyone is very conspiracy theory. <br>

If you listen quietly you can *almost* hear the black helicopters circling......<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway:  If you wish to be involved with killing CT, then you need to do one of the following.<br>
<br>
A)  Host a raid where CT is up. (heh I wish I was that smart).<br>
B)  Attend a raid where CT is up.  Gotta be smart and popular.<br>
C)  Ask a raid who is doing Fear while CT is up, if you and your guild can have/help kill CT.<br>
<br>
If you are not willing to do one of those 3 things however difficult they may be, you're going to loose out.  Yes, some folks are on different time zones.  Yes, you can't gaurantee anything about if a mob will be up.  NO! You cannot regulate it any further without straining our already taxed system.(oh and FFA won't serve Europe any better as they could go FFA on a mob that's never going to be up for them anyway(as lanos himself mentioned)).<br>
<br>
Understand that we have a system with many many different interests and as with any such system it will serve the interests of the majority first.  That doesn't make the majority greedy, it just makes them a majority.<br>

The high lvl guilds would only go there when something there was worth killing. <br>
<br>
Thoric the planes would only be fair if they were like PoG. No more secret deals under the table like maximus fear raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Like I said. We might not see the spawns more, but we would have the same chance as everyone else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally I think we are at the point were hate and fear doesnt have to be reservable anymore. <br>

I give up, you live in such a fantasy world of delusional conspiracy theories there really isn't any point in arguing it with you. <br>
<br>
Like I said, put up or shut up, if you won't even try to put a CT raid together like we do then your whining lacks all credibility. You just want to cut the deck in your favor and pretend like you are doing a service for the rest of us. <br>
<br>
I am so tired of people wearing their self-interest on their sleeves accusing us of greed and double dealing. Stop spreading gay rumors and put in the work. Get used to the idea this stuff isn't handed to you on a silver platter.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1565.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1574.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1572.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1565.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1565.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1565.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
