<br>
They were the true finesse centers, with complete game, I give you that, however Shaq can't help the fact that he is huge. He does get fouled on every possesion, and the refs can't call it every time. More and more people are complaining now because he won 3 titles in a row (Magic and Kareem won 5, but never 3 in a row), he is starting to make his free throws, and he is becoming a better shooter. <br>
<br>
I don't see how these people can say he has no talent. It's like saying as long as you are huge, you can be Shaq. Vlade is 7'1 and 280, his game isn't even close to Shaq's, in fact it's so different, you'd think Vlade was playing a different sport. There are plenty of players close to 300 lbs (yes I know Shaq is 350-370) that can't dominate the way he does. <br>
<br>
In his early Orlando days, it was all dunks. People loved him. Thought he was great for the game. Why? He wasn't a threat on an overrated Magic squad. He sucked at free throws, his jumper was non-existent, and he couldn't pass his way out of a paper bag. I remember a game where Shaq dunked so hard he pulled the backboard down. They had to stop play for 10 minutes. He was a hero then, but now he makes the NBA look bad? Give me a break. <br>
<br>
It all boils down to this.... If Shaq is on your team, he is awesome, he has skills, he is great for the NBA. If he's not on your team, or worse yet, has eliminated your team from the playoffs, he sucks ass, and is a whiney baby bricklayer that needs to stop by Jenny Craig, and take music lessons.<br>

<br>
No, he didn't mention Jordan directly.  However:<br>
<br>
Game 6 of the '98 NBA Finals, Bulls/Jazz.  Everyone that follow basketball remember who made the winning shot?  Yes, Jordan.<br>
<br>
Does everyone remember the crossover that made Shandon Anderson (if I remember the guard right) almost fall over?  K, bear that in mind.<br>
<br>
Now go back over the replay, and look at the ref off to the side.  Watch him watching Jordan going up.  Now watch him completely miss the fact that Jordan had a hand on Anderson's butt and shoved him forward to get clearance.  No call.<br>
<br>
So, um...exactly how does Shaq 'destroy the game' when Jordan got away with doing the same thing four years earlier, on a championship winning shot, no less?<br>
<br>
I repeat, the writer's an idiot.  Don't blame Shaq if you're not gonna look at Jordan.<br>
<br>
Edit: One other thing, and if you argue this point, you don't know NBA history.<br>
<br>
From this fool's article:<br>
<br>
"If the NBA weren't so obsessed with developing larger-than-life superstars, they'd find ways to make the game more fair and exciting, regardless of size. They'd lengthen the court to force your big butt up and down faster (and to the sidelines for rest), they'd widen the court to allow shooters and creative players the space to operate, they'd widen the lane to open it up, and they'd raise the basket to reduce your advantage."<br>
<br>
K, this is where the writer loses all credibility.  He's arguing that the game would be much higher quality (and I agree with this, by the by) if these things could be implemented to give the game a better flow.  In other words, he wants to go back to the way the game was in the past.<br>
<br>
The game, in fact, had that flow up until the Lakers/Celtics teams of the 80s disbanded.  Once those teams started to get older, other teams thought that if they could play 'thug' ball (for lack of another word), to throw them off their game, they could be beaten.<br>
<br>
Enter the 88-89 Detroit Pistons.  Now I'm not aware of this, was Shaquille O'Neal on that team?<br>
<br>
Once the Pistons started regularly getting dispatched by the Bulls, starting in '91, 'thug' ball became all the rage to dispatch them as well (not that it ever worked), and the primary users of that tactic were Pat Riley's Knick teams.<br>
<br>
Did Shaquille O'Neal ever play for the Knicks under Pat Riley?<br>
<br>
If you're gonna lay blame for today's game on anyone's feet, look at Chuck Daly's Pistons and the Knicks-Heat series of the 90s.  Blaming Shaq is simply ignorant. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useanen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seanen</A> at: 6/13/02 11:14:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugeeldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geeldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/14/02 12:39:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17058.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lakers win ! mvp inside!</span><hr size=1> That's true, Riley fines his players if they don't play rough. <p>Geeldor Mooncaster<br>
