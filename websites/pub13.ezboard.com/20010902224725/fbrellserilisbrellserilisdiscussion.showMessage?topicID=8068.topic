<br>
well.. heres my story<br>
i dont really know how to say this but please bare with me.. it might even be confusing  <br>
<br>
i started playing EQ november of last year.. i had tried lots of characters and some of them i took to 20+ lvls ..<br>
but 2 classes really did it for me which were enchanter and SK.<br>
<br>
due to the fact that my enchanter was a higher level than my SK i had decided to play my enchanter to a level where i can make enough money to buy some nice stuff for my SK and play him as my main character.<br>
<br>
soo... one day im exp hunting with my chanter and i receive a tell from Pich saying ' do you like shadow knights? ' so i respond with a yes i really like them .. i actually have one and want to buy gear for him.. bla bla bla... .. make a long story short i ended up trading my lvl33 enchanter for a lvl 33 SK who had a DB rod on him and some banded and fine plate pieces which i considered AMAZING items at that point.<br>
<br>
so here i am with a brand new character which i really liked named Pich Blach.. it took me weeks to figure out all the little things you need to know in order to play a SK at that level  <br>
<br>
( i died 12 times in the first 2 days <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .. i was trying to FD while running <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and didnt know i was KoS everywhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <br>
<br>
but at the end i think i did a pretty good job.. and not that im bragging but 80% of the groups ive been in congratulate me on a good job while pulling.. and i once pulled the arena in kael and got a tell from the leader saying nice job  .. man that was a fun night..<br>
<br>
ive had Pich for 6 months now ..<br>
<br>
During this time thou ive received numerous tells from ppl laughing at me who obviously knew how i got this account and some of them accused me of stealing it but i usually didnt pay attention to them due to the fact that they had their point and because i didnt want to lose the friends i had made should my account get banned if i turned it into an argument..<br>
<br>
but it turns out that this account has had 3 owners before me who made a bad reputation for him and ive had to put up with it for quite some time now..<br>
<br>
some ppl i wont mention names have threatened to tell my guild leader and post on the brell board about me <br>
<br>
..<br>
<br>
Today i received a tell from a person claiming that 9 months ago this account was stolen from him and that he would call verant if i dont give it back to him right away... so after 2hrs of talking with him i realized that he wasnt lying and that someone DID steal his account .. i felt sorry for him so i made a decision today to give him back his account who now has 2 Jboots  /cry &lt; im gonna miss you  .... numerous no drop keys and items..<br>
<br>
..<br>
<br>
i will log on tomorrow with Pich for one last time to do the /guild remove and let all the ppl i made friends with know that i wont be playing Pich anymore<br>

<br>
If you give him the account, you don't get the account (duh!).<br>
<br>
If he calls Verant, the account gets banned as it's a hacked account as per Verant's official rulings concerning hacked accounts.  In the end, you don't get the account.<br>
<br>
Why are you giving the account back?<br>
<br>
I'm guessing he's probably lying about the situation.  9 months ago was before Verant banned &quot;hacked&quot; accounts, and actually gave them back to the original owners I believe.  This isn't 9 months ago, and the original owner is probably trying to scam a free account with scare tactics.  If you refuse to give the account back, he can't get it no matter what.  If he pushes the issue, it just gets banned, and neither person gets the account.  There's everything to gain by telling the guy to shove off.  And why has he only come around 9 freakin months to try to get his account back???  I know if someone &quot;stole&quot; my account, I'd be trying to get it back immediately.<br>

<br>
and plus i was getting tired of having to put up with people blaming me for stealing the account and calling me 'brell's SK' and how half the server has had the account after i have worked really hard to obtain my items and the title Reaver for Pich.<br>
<br>
but anyways.. i just posted it to let people know what my side of the story was and to let the people i have made friends with know that i wont be playing him no more if i dont find them tomorrow.<br>

<br>
now even telling a gm yur room mate was running you account is grounds for banning.<br>
<br>
The guys owned the account 9 months ago...giving it back would be fine IF it was still the account that was stolen 9 months ago.<br>
<br>
And for all you know this guys does this with every  scuse the term ebayed account he finds out about.<br>
<br>
if he wants an account so bad he shoudl simply get another one. the game is 9.99 at target and it has never been as easy as it is these days to get from 1 - 50 in nothing flat. <p>Daarken Wraithfyre

Now with the banning of &quot;hacked&quot; accounts it's easier to scare people out of their stuff.  Another example of these are 2 people that work together.  1 finds out what equipment you got and the other one tries to scare you by saying you stole / traded for that item piece and that it belonged to him and that he want's it back or he's forced to call the GMs and get both accounts banned.<br>

Tell him, you will inform the VI, that he is trying to scam you and he would loose all his accounts in the investigation, if he doesn't stop this. This usually makes them shut up.<br>

I remember the incidents of this all to well, back when it happened.<br>
<br>
I was under the impression that &quot;pich&quot; had been banned quite some time ago, but when i saw &quot;you&quot; reappear I realized it must not have been permanent.<br>
<br>
If this &quot;original&quot; owner is who they say they are, the should have the CD key and station name.<br>
<br>
Keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
But again knowing the history i take this all with a grain of salt. <p>Exuo Plazeq, Another Proud Officer Of  <a href="http://www.daskurge.1hwy.com">Da Skurge.</a>

He traded some items for soulbreaker ( the acct. ) <br>

Soulbreaker called up VI and got his account back, totaly screwed my friend over.<br>

<br>
1) sac yourself to 46 and transfer the pp made from it to new account<br>
2) dont leave anything on the account except the same value of equipement as when you got it....like bronze armor or the like..take everythign else with you.<br>
<br>
I completely disagree with you about giving the account back ..but its your life to lead.<br>
<br>
but dont let this scammer(for that is what I believe he is) get anything but the barebones.<br>
<br>
<br>
If it is NOT a scammer they should have no issues with the above 2 conditions. The char is still WELL above where it was when they &quot;lost&quot; the account.<br>
If the person does have issues with it ..then take that as a clue that it is a scammer..and if you really dont want pitch anymore ..report HIM and get the account hes harassing you with baned along with pitch THEN start your new sk. <p><center>Phazy Daayz 52st lvl Disciple<center><br><center>Drunks of Tunare..least till they throw me outa the bar<center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uinnatookanran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Innatook Anran</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#CC9900>(8/16/01 11:45:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the story of PICH BLACH</span><hr size=1> Don't give him YOUR account.
