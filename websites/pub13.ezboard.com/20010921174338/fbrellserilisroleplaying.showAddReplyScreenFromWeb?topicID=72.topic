tale.<br>
<br>
  I was born in east Freeport on the continent of Antonica, known in old as Tunare. My only sibling was my twin brother, Trylorn. Our father, Veros K`Radinar, was captain of his own ship, a fishing vessel, while our mother, Lyldana, worked as a tailor, making simple clothing for the fisherfolk of our neighborhood.<br>
<br>
  Trylorn &amp; I were identical twins, yet as similar as we were in countenance, so dissimilar were we in spirit. As children we would often go on our father's vessel, the Mistrider, if he was making a short fishing run close to the coast. I remember how Trylorn loved those trips, clambering through the rigging &amp; playing at being a pirate while the crew laughed, or cursed when they were caught up in one of his pranks. I more often would sit near the stern, reading a book while soaking in the sun until Trylorn teased me into chasing after him. Even when the Mistrider was in port, Trylorn would often hang around the docks, helping with repairing the netting, or scraping barnacles from the hull. I could  never understand why he had such an interest in the sea, no more than our father could understand my interest in books.<br>
<br>
  Around our fourteenth year, however, I at last discovered Trylorn's true interest in hanging around the docks. As the other fishing brats began to chase after the young girls in the market square, Trylorn &amp; I found ourselves far more interested in the sailors &amp; guards around the port. Our father was rather stern in his views, &amp; we did not discuss our growing interests with him. The first mate of the Mistrider, though, a half-elf named Stormdrake, caught Trylorn &amp; the son of one of the guards kissing under the docks one day. He sent Trylorn to fetch me, and we both met him fearing that he would denounce us before our father. Instead, he told us of other lands he had traveled, where it was not uncommon for people -- elves, &amp; half-elves, and even humans -- to pair man with man, or woman with woman. Surely, this was as much a relief to me as it was a disappointment to Trylorn, who had reveled for awhile in the glory of being unique.<br>
<br>
  Stormdrake's tale ignited a thirst in us both to look beyond our little dockside community. While Trylorn expanded his adventures beyond those few willing companions he could find around the port in the eastern city, I continued my studies, reading all I could of the world beyond Freeport's walls. We were approaching our sixteenth year, and the time was at hand when we would be too old to apprentice. Our father had continued to expect that we both would follow him into the fishing trade, but we had both resisted. Trylorn was more interested in exploring the city &amp; breaking hearts. I, however, had spoken with our mother of my desires to study more than the local bard could teach of letters and figures. She finally interceded with our father, even offering to pay my apprenticing fee from her own small earnings in tailoring. This shamed him, as Veros was always a proud man, and he insisted that the fee was not at issue, only the command of the Mistrider when he was no longer able to captain her. While Trylorn &amp; I listened from our room, our fates were decided for us, as our father agreed to see me apprenticed to the Academy of Sciences while taking Trylorn on as a mate on the Mistrider -- whether he liked it or not.<br>
<br>
  The following week I was told to report to the Academy to begin my studies. This was to be the first time that Trylorn and I had been apart for long. My time would be taken up with studies &amp; performing tasks for my master, while Trylorn would be going on the deepsea fishing voyages with our father. The night before I was to leave, we stayed awake late into the night, talking of our hopes &amp; dreams. While he was glad to see me apprenticed, Trylorn was leery of his own future on the Mistrider. I think he was beginning to realize that the life of the fisherman was far different from the 'Grand Adventure' that he had envisioned as a child. I yearned for him to find a future more to his liking, and promised to help him once my studies were complete. We planned how we would sail away together on a boat piloted by winds I would summon, while he would fight off pirates &amp; Monsters of the Deep.<br>
<br>
  Upon arriving at the Academy the next day, I reported to my assigned master, a high-level wizard by the name of Kuchara. I will not bore you here with tales of the endless mundane tasks I performed for him, preparing spell components or fetching arcane scrolls from the library. Nor shall I mention the numerous failures I made while attempting to learn mastery of the eldritch forces, except to say that one should NEVER attempt to cast Gimball's Lesser Cantrip using Blood of Troll. Suffice to say that my master was fair, and my hair eventually returned to its normal color. My thoughts of adventure began to fade as I found myself at last in a place where my thirst for knowledge could, almost, be quenched.<br>
<br>
  My training continued apace, and I was able to visit my family on some occasions, such as festdays or my master's rare trips to Qeynos. On these days I would somewhat reluctantly put aside the trappings of my class and worries of exams, and return for a time to the humble settings of my youth. My mother would greet me with joy, and my father, while still dubious of the value of 'that wizardy stuff' would at least ask after my studies and grunt his approval when I told of a cantrip or potion I had mastered. Always, though, I was troubled to see the changes in my brother. Trylorn was tearing at the hook as our father reeled him further into the fisher trade. He confided to me that he had journeyed in secret to the Coalition of Tradesfolk, &amp; was learning the ways of the rogue. Studying secretly by night when he was in port &amp; working on the Mistrider for days in good weather was taking its toll on him, however, and I cautioned him lest Veros discover the true reason for his worn demeanor.<br>
<br>
  It was as I returned from one of these rare trips home that my fate took an odd turn. For while Trylorn had broken more than a few hearts by now, I had mostly contented myself with gazing with longing on the occasional guard or fellow student, while devoting my energies to my studies. However, as I rounded a corner near the Theater of the Tranquil, I ran full on into a young half-elf, and we both fell to the ground. He rose quickly to his feet and then knelt beside me, thinking, I guess, that I had been stunned by the fall. I was indeed stunned, but because I had been struck by one of Erollisi's Arrows. Kneeling beside me was the most beautiful being I had ever seen, and my knees would not support my stricken frame. He asked after my health, and as I blushed and stammered some inane response, he noted the look on my face -- and he smiled. He smiled! Telling me his name was Matrill, he offered to buy me a drink at a local tavern, and we rose to our feet. Walking beside him as he struck up a conversation, I found myself forgetting completely the studies that had so consumed me a mere sunrise before.<br>
<br>
  I now found myself looking for any excuse to take a break from my duties to be with Matrill. Although he was almost of an age with my father, the elven blood in his veins made him near as young as me in body &amp; spirit. We enjoyed the delights of the city, and spent as much time together as my training allowed. The only shadow on the glow in which I found myself walking was that the Gods had decreed this affair should be short. Matrill was in Freeport to meet with some companions before heading across the Sea of Tears to Faydwer. I think our time together was even more sweet with the bitter taste of parting lingering always on the horizon.<br>
<br>
  During these few weeks, my devotion to my studies as an apprentice suffered greatly, and when the time came for Matrill to leave, I neglected them even more as I pined for the loss of my first love. My master noted my change in behavior, but thought it was anxiety over my upcoming exams for entrance into the First Circle of Wizards &amp; the end of my apprenticeship. In truth, I had barely given these things a thought, but he insisted that I take some time to rest &amp;  ordered me to go home for a couple of days.<br>
<br>
  Ah, the strange ways of the Gods! I arrived home heartsick to find my family in an uproar. It seems that my brother had had the brilliant idea to bring his latest fling along on a short fishing run. Unfortunately, one of the crewmen had recognized his 'friend' &amp; told our father of his ways -- both with men &amp; their coinpurses. Veros had confronted Trylorn, &amp; my brother had confessed to the affair &amp; told of his apprenticeship with the local rogues. At this point, he was confined to his room, while Veros was ranting about the house. My entrance incited his anger further, as he questioned me about the nature of my own heart. I, too, revealed my feelings at last. He threatened to throw me in the room with Trylorn, but I ran out &amp; made my way back to the Academy. Here I confessed my troubles to my master. He assured me that the Academy cared not about the ways of my heart, only the skills of my mind. After much begging, I secured his permission to bring my brother to the Academy to stay until he could secure lodgings of his own.<br>
<br>
  I returned to the port to see one of the great ships leaving for Faydwer. As I hurried home, I heard my brother call to me from the departing vessel, &quot;Trylain, don't bother looking for me there. I've had enough of Veros, &amp; enough of Freeport. I'm off to Faydwer, &amp; a life of adventure &amp; freedom! Take care, brother, &amp; follow me as soon as you graduate that Academy!&quot; I called back, &quot;I'll do that -- go with the Gods!&quot;<br>
<br>
  For the next couple of days, I renewed my studies with a vigor, eager to graduate &amp; follow after my brother. On the third day after he departed, I stood before my master &amp; two others, prepared to take my final exam for entrance into the First Circle. Question after question was thrown at me, &amp; each I answered with ease. Finally, my master smiled &amp; stepped forward. He handed me a small, leatherbound tome -- my own book of spells! &quot;Congratulations, Trylain. Welcome to the First Circle of Wizards.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Filled with joy, I packed my few possesions &amp; made my way to the docks, ready to leave for Faydwer. However, as I approached, I heard a tumult from the pier where the great ships put in. I made my way through the crowd, &amp; saw a bedraggled &amp; badly beaten man dripping seawater on the end of the pier. As I listened in shock, he told of the tragedy that had befallen the ship on which he had traveled.<br>
<br>
  &quot;We was makin' our ways across the Ocean 'o Tears. Bound for Faydwer we was. I was sittin' on the sides of the boat, just a'fishin' fer some supper -- terrible grub they has on them boats, terrible. Well, afore ye knew it, the whole boats been surrounded by this strange mist -- ye couldn't see yer own hand, much less t'other folk on board. Then I hears this terrible roarin', &amp; someone ascreamin' 'Cyclops! Cyclops!', &amp; all kind a bashin's &amp; smashin's &amp; such. Well, I be knowin' the dangers a the cyclops on those isles out there, so's I real quick thinks 'Right -- if the cyclops is on the boat, I be better off in the water, then.' &amp; jumps off. Swam for days, stoppin' at little rocks &amp; islands to rest. Bare made it back alive, what with the monsters on the islands &amp; the sharks in the sea atryin' to see which could eats me first.&quot;<br>
<br>
  On hearing his words, I was filled with a terrible foreboding. Stepping forward, I asked the poor man if he had been on the ship that left three days before. &quot;Aye,&quot; he said, &quot;that be the one. And I hopes ye didna know anyones aboard her or ye can be prayin' to the Gods fer their soul to find its way back, 'cause their bodies never will.&quot; Stricken by his words, I reached out with my mind to my brother... &amp; found nothing. As the crowd &amp; the pier swirled around me, I turned &amp; ran for home. Surely Trylorn's soul would return there, where we had been born, if the worst had befallen him. I pounded on the door until our mother answered, &amp; told her of the survivor's story. At first she did not believe me, but when she reached out with her mind, she began to wail, &quot;Nay, nay, he has not returned &amp; he is not in my mind! How can this be, how can this be?!&quot;<br>
<br>
  I tried to comfort her, when Veros walked through the door. &quot;So -- you were at the pier as well, then.&quot; I looked up at him, as he stared at me with eyes of ice. &quot;Your brother is dead &amp; his soul has not returned. This is how the Gods treat those of your ilk. Leave now, for you are no longer welcome in this house.&quot; I stood to go, but stopped at the door. &quot;You are wrong, Father. The Gods had nothing to do with Trylorn's fate -- it was you who drove him away. And don't worry -- I'll not cast my shadow on this house again.&quot; &quot;Go then!&quot; he shouted, &quot;Find someone to coddle you, 'cause you'll never amount to nothing on your own! You're too weak, &amp; always were. I've no doubt 'twas you led Trylorn astray. He was normal. He was a good boy.&quot; As I turned to leave, I heard the words that froze my heart to my father forever, &quot;Would that the Gods had taken you instead.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Returning to the Academy, I procured a room in the journeyman's hall. With my brother gone, there was no reason to risk the journey to Faydwer. I would begin my career here, in Freeport, though never again would I frequent the docks &amp; shops of the eastern part of the city. For days, I lay in this small room, staring at the walls &amp; barely eating. When finally I could cry no more, I made my way to the western gate &amp; gazed out upon the wilds that began a few feet from the city walls. What strange beasts would I encounter, what fate lay before me? At the moment, I barely cared, still too lost in the pain of my brother's loss. Sighing, I cast a spell of armor upon my body, &amp; stepped out of the gate to begin to do what all survivors must -- live.<br>
<br>
  (OOC -- Look for more tales of Trylain &amp; Trylorn at this site &amp; the Theater of the Tranquil on the main EQ site. I plan to post the full chronicles as they're written with some screenshots on my website, which should be up in a few weeks (patience, it takes away from EQ playtime).)<br>
