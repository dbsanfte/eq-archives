what happens in another year?  unless they stop upgrading, warriors will have near 10k hps.  something must be done, now.  my fav idea is giving druids a 33% heal, maybe done over time, i dont care.  or give us some uniqueness in Damage dealing on raids, either direct or by increaseing damage dealt by others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhuzurdadi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Huzurdadi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 1:23:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27012.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why beat around the bush?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

I think that your entire petition is a waste of time since it asks for a number of items which really don't address the core issue. And the reason why you don't address the core issue is because you are afraid of the b*tching that clerics will do when you do address the central issue.<br>
<br>
Simply explain, as if it needs explaining, that CH is tremendously more powerful than any other heal in the game. Since it is the only spell that scales in power as tanks (and heck any other character) scales in power it is by definition unbalanced wrt. other constant heals. <br>
<br>
For other healers to maintain a constant ratio of effectiveness with clerics they need a heal which scales. <br>
<br>
Thus, I recommended giving the other healers a scaling heal that is 66% as mana effective as cleric healing. What ratio do you think clerics want? The current x4 ratio? Sounds a little messed up, doesn't it?<br>

I &quot;heard&quot; that they will be increasing the power of the players (yet again) when the &quot;Planes of Power&quot; is released.  Some people were talking about levels to 70?  Not that this has been confirmed anywhere, that I have seen.  <br>
<br>
If this is going to happen, then druids/shaman abilities to heal are going to be even more minuscule than they are now.  The more they upgrade tanks, the less need there is for a druid to<br>
heal.  If they allow chars to get to level 70, (or some equivalent in skills/abilities) then our ability to heal is going to be laughable.<br>
<br>
Many people complain about druids/shaman getting CH, and their argument(s) against it usually are:<br>
<br>
1. “if druids/shaman get CH, it will trivialize encounters, and the VI staff will upgrade mobs to ungodly levels to compensate”.  <br>
<br>
My retort to this is, havent they already done so?  Don’t they (or havent they), when they create(d) new Velious/Luclin mobs, take they CH rotations into consideration.  Don’t they<br>
assume that the top guilds on each server will have a multitude of lvl 60 clerics at their disposal when attempting these boss mobs?  Therefor, they ALREADY have buffed up the mobs with the consideration that there will be a bunch (more than an adequate number) of CH’s there at the<br>
raids disposal.  So what does it matter if the Complete Healers are clerics, or if they are druids, or if they are shaman?  For this particular argument it doesnt matter (imo).  <br>
<br>
2.  “if druids/shaman get CH, who would want to play a cleric?” <br>
<br>
Clerics still get the ultimate rez.  They still have CH.  They still have the best buffs.  They (VI) could make it so that shaman/druids get CH at a much larger mana cost, and/or slower cast time.  They could give clerics some additional spells (spells that would give clerics the ability to solo<br>
for exp, or solo easier, if they need).  Oh, but you say, clerics don’t want to solo at the high end of the game?  (Well, now you are thinking like druids.  We really don’t want to solo at the high end of the game either.  But, I digress.)  Clerics buffs would still be stronger, their healing abilities would be more mana efficient and faster, and they would still be the most desireable healer for a group.  <br>
<br>
Summary: <br>
<br>
I know VI wont ever give druids/shaman the same CH as they give clerics.  But, some variation is needed.  A much stronger heal, or a % heal, or a CH that costs much more mana than a cleric’s and/or takes longer to cast, something.  <br>

Regardless of whether clerics would be for or against it, I don't think there's a chance in hell of Verant expanding the classes that can cast CH.  Druids and Shaman would stand a better chance of getting a full XP res...:)<br>
<br>
But yes, CH dominates healing in the high level game, and thus breaks healing for other priest classes.  A 2000 or 3000 point heal wouldn't enable shaman and druids to keep up in a high level raid, where the cleric team is sequentially casting CH every 3 to 5 seconds on the MT. <br>
<br>
So we (meaning druids) have to look elsewhere for healing contributions on the high level raid.  One such area is AoE healing, due to the AoE damage effects of many of these mobs.  Paladins are better healers on high level raids than druids for this reason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=leadar>Leadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 3:09:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27012.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why beat around the bush?</span><hr size=1> Scirocco, <br>
<br>
Im sure they would love to have never introduced CH into the game.  But, VI could NEVER take CH out of the game now, unless they totally re-did all of the upper end mobs since the Velious/Luclin expansions.  Because all the upper end mobs were created in these expansions with CH in mind.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, the cat is out of the bag, and is not going back in the bag, without significant effort.  CH is obviously intended to be used in these encounters.  <br>
<br>
Do I think they will, or should, give other priests the same CH as they give clerics? No.  Should they do something else to help? Yes. <br>

Yes, Druids and shaman need to have this spell, YES, it completely reverses the problem and makes clerics a &quot;one of&quot; class on raids because you only need one click stick, one person for blessing of ageo. At this point duplication of clerics is pretty worthless except as secondary healers.<br>
<br>
and if all this happen i still, as a cleric, say there is nothing wrong. It just proves how utterly kneecaped clerics are for having CH, a level 39 spell. They should have kept the level +5 on all classes, and not deviated. sup heal should be 39 for dru/sha, ch should be 49, and then the classes should diverge by clerics getting the specialist healing lines post 50 and hybrids getting them 3 levels later (remedy at 54, DL at 56) but they should not have ever been givin HoT spells, nor should they ever be givin AOE healing.<br>
<br>
True balance is when you stop blurring class lines. take away cleric dots, take away cleric ranged aoe spells.  we didnt start with them, and i dont want them.  what should druids give up that has been added, to better focus them?  I am not a druid, so i ask you to tell me. <p>____________________________________________

<br>
The best druid heal (Nature's Touch) has a ratio of something like 2.5.<br>
<br>
CH has a ratio of something like 10 (assuming that it heals 4k HP, it can heal more at high level, but let's use this as a base line).<br>
<br>
So by the mana ratio metric clerics heal x4 as well as druids.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you will if Direct Damage scaled in the same way between wizards and druids. Or heck between any two classes. Let's compare wizards and clerics! <br>
<br>
The best (non bane) wizard spell does 1.2k damage with a mana ratio of 4. The best cleric spell does 925 damage with a ratio of ~3. <br>
<br>
If Cleric DDs were held to the same standard that they want other class's healing to be held to they would have a nuke of 300 points of damage with a mana ratio of 1. LOL! People would die of laughter if Verant had proposed such insanity. Yet people accept it for clerics for some mysterious reason (perhaps because clerics have always threatened to withhold rezes? I don't know).<br>
<br>
Heck, let's compare the ratio between druids and wizards for nuking. People currently think that the ratio is 'fair.' Moonfire does ~1100 points of damage for 450 mana. That's a ratio of 2.4. Wizards do about 1.2k with Ice Spear of Solist for 300 mana. That's a ratio of 4. Thus the ratio between wizards and druids is 1.666. <br>
<br>
Thus, it would follow that giving druids a CH that costs 700 mana or so would be in line with other specialist vs. generalists.<br>
