I started in Nov of some year on a friends account, played to lev 20 pre-twink era, got hooked, bought a computer and EQ, deleted Keara and started over.<br>
<br>
Joined my first guild that consisted of 10 college guys from La. At 30, I married and joined Keara to another guild. Which consisted mostly of a large group of friends from Ark. Then I went solo a long time. Joined another guild some from the 2nd guild where in there. Then solo again, yet another long time. Then giving guilds another try, I joined guild 3. 2 weeks later they disbanned. solo again.<br>
<br>
I raided a lot. I did so many epic raids I lost count. I made what I thought were many friends through out my years. Only to watch many go to other guilds, switch servers or stop playing all together. <br>
<br>
To be in most guilds you have to have: this key or that key, be a certain level, have certain gear, and/or raid every minute you play. It used to be this way to get into some of the larger guilds a long time ago but it seems like all of them are like that now. When the lager mobs were on a rotation list you knew what days you had to be at the raid. The lists are now gone and usually when you log on you have to jump and run. <br>
<br>
Why should it matter how many hours you play, where you play from or what you do and don't have just to get into a guild. Being in a guild is about being around people you like to play with and seeing and trying new things. Being in a guild should be based on your ability and attitude. But EQ has turned into such a loot monger society, you can not join to just be with people, you have to join to be as thirsty as others to get phat loots. Standards have been set to join guilds because people whine they need this or that, so guilds want you to have the stuff so they don't have to listen to you whine about little things you need help getting. This aspect is understandable but not everyone whines about loot. More times then others, the people already in your guilds whine more about getting or not getting loot then the person who just wants to hang out and have some fun. <br>
<br>
EQ has turned into a loot monger, selfish society. Not to mention all the fights over non-boss mobs because someone needs 60 aa points. Or someone needs to sell an item for pp more then the person trying to get the item to use for themselves.<br>
<br>
yeah I have ranted about a few things and the one purpose I wanted to write about I have not said yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You can call on many people to help you get an item or to help you on a raid, but you need to remember that person may need your help also one day so stop being so gd self centered and remember that person when they say they need help too.  I was talking to a druid friend last night, and they need 2 pieces left for their epic. I know this druid has helped many people over the years but when they ask for help everyone is too busy. Does anyone work harder then the next person, is anyone's epic any less important ? Just because its not say a stick rezzing cleric does not mean an epic is not just as important to the person trying to get theirs. You need all kinds of different classes for all different types of mobs. Everyone does have a bit of importance at some point. Everyone's blood does spill the same when they die just some get whacked faster then others.<br>
<br>
Don't take me off the shelf and dust me or anyone else off because you know we can/will help you acquire something, hopefully you remembered our name because of the players we are and not what we can do for you. Send us a tell when your looking for a partner, more for your group or have a open spot on a raid. Sending us a tell just to say hello works also.<br>
<br>
Well if you read this long a$$ post this far, I hope you did not fall asleep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  EQ is just not the same anymore.<br>

I agree.  It has been hard for me too.  I enjoy EQ, but I play to get grps and go exp.  I like the social aspect.  That's how I am in RL.  I want to spend time with friends and enjoy myself.  This caused me turmoil in an old guild, as they are a raid guid, and I was just not in the position to commit to almost nightly raids.  On a different note, in defense of bigger guilds, the requirments you have stated are in place for good reason.  Guilds like KTF, Unity, Stasis, IV, etc. are only for the more serious player, the hard core player.  The stuff they do requires players to have a certain amount of resists, etc.  Keys are important because a guild cannot stop to help every new member get a key to Sleepers or VP.  As for the friends issue, I feel ya on that one.  I have had several &quot;friends&quot;  ask me for help, then never return the favor when I was in need.  It was always the &quot;I am too busy atm&quot;, even when I have informed them of my plans for the day a week or two in advance.  After playing for almost 2 years and 3 different characters, I know who my real friends are.  They are the ones that can still tell me the name of my first character in EQ, (Korova Milkbar, the almighty necro!!  I kinda miss him..*sniff*) and always are willing to help.    <p><center><b><i><font color=green>Nuada Argat`Lahm</font></b></i></center><br><center>Wood Elf Druid of the 54th leaf.</center><br>

This is how the game was designed.  It is what the 'enviroment' promotes.  I laugh when people say EQ is a MMORPG.  There is nothing of the sort that has to do with 'RPG'  I haven't played Morrowind yet but from what I read, that how a 'true' RPG should be.  This idea that the items you aquire make you stronger as well as give you more prestige leads me to wonder why anyone questions the materialistic nature of this game.  Outside of good friends, you are judged by the items you wear and possess.  It is why the powergamer runs rampart and the disputes are endless in and out of the game.  It's the reason how friends who have played the game together for a year can suddenly stop talking to one another due to the 'stealing' of ones camp.<br>
<br>
It's too bad the majority of players do not think as you Keara. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uarkanissoulhart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arkanis Soulhart</A> at: 5/17/02 8:37:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ushrieek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shrieek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 9:11:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1152.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nhbzone.com/up4it/up4it_images/rep29.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same any more</span><hr size=1> Many people think like her....

<br>
EQ before Kunark was a great place to chill out for a few hours a night.  Kunark and the introduction of super loot ruined lots of the game's atmosphere by sheer greed for things so you can impress a newbie for 30 seconds of your day or you can live longer in a raid.<br>
<br>
I remember when EQ wasn't based on GUILD ONLY events.<br>
Everyone was welcome to come take down a dragon or a god, or people would scramble to get that one druid in their group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now since the expansions there has been one mindset.  <br>
That is :  Must get the loot at all costs.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes costs are your friends.  I chose to not get the loot if it cost me friends.<br>
<br>
Curiosity, greed, and power in a game (if there is such thing) is what has made the server as it is today.<br>
<br>
The mentality has shifted for the worse and the smaller groups of people or the lesser equipped group of people have to wait till the larger group is done pharming for keys or finally finished with the mob out of boredom.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Can't change the atmosphere.  Verant has made the game this way and out of a business decision that people who want the loot are more likely to keep playing.<br>
<br>
Only loot I ever cared about was getting my next spell or a new robe etc.<br>
<br>
I will still stick to this when I say that epics are what ruined the game.  The design was done terribly.<br>
<br>
All epic mobs should be triggered period!  That solves so much problem.<br>
<br>
You get uberguild01 wanting an epic for their twinks <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You have casualplayer01 wanting an epic after 2 years of questing for it at the best pace they could manage.  Mobs are FCFS and people aren't happy unless they get their epic.<br>
<br>
Some use it as a status symbol.  Others just want to get it because they wanted to do a grand accomplishment in many years of playing.<br>
<br>
Oh well.  Just do what you find is fun.  Leave the loot/level race alone.<br>
<br>
I know with 3 years of playing if I stuck it out with the high levels I would be level 60 right now with lots of great loot but I chose not to do so.<br>
<br>
I remember when I would be hunting in lake rathe and I would stop to watch the sun set over the horizon cause it was just so cool.<br>
<br>
Now if I tried to do that some guy would take my spawn and tell me I am not killing them fast enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Then try to train goblins on me or something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and petition that I tried to KS them....<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I miss the old EQ.  This game has no room for the casual player any longer if you want to experience as much as you can. <p><img src="http://dabise.tripod.ca/shrieek3.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwaladen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Waladen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 10:40:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1152.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.infoceptor.net/animations/zergmaca2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same any more</span><hr size=1> Sorry but the &quot;old&quot; eq wasn't that much different Shriek.<br>
<br>
There were guild politics, mob squabbles, loot fights, etc. The difference is that until you were 46+ you never saw this in the 1-50 eq nearly as much. And before Kunark the higher end population were on a lot of twinks too. Then when Kunark came out the race to 60 started and suddenly out of the woodwork older characters were seen again. Now AA causes people to bring out their old characters for something other than a raid.<br>
<br>
What I think is different for a lot of people is that there are SCORES of 55+ people when before that just wasn't that many as a % of the player base. You put too many of anything in a confined area with limited resources, fights break out. It was like that in the 1 to 50 game in Solb and Lguk too at times during peak hours.<br>
<br>
Guilds are a two edged sword sometimes. Yes you have your guild to do things with but at the same time I think the guild system promotes clics and isolation between various people on the server. As a morning player, I have to group with a lot of different people from all kinds of guilds. I notice more and more people are hesitant about inviting people they don't know, they don't like the guild they are in, or whatever. That's sad in a way, most people I meet in the game in the mornings are really decent folks.<br>
<br>
 Personally I don't mind requirements for the upper end guilds, it makes things smoother and more enjoyable for those in it. You know that guy standing next to you in NToV has X resists, Y instant cast items, Z equipment and will be viable in the raid. You know that he might live and not have to waste time and mana ressing and rebuffing him numerous times during the evening.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I understand where Keara is coming from I just don't think it's quite as bad as it is painted. I still enjoy playing a lot, and I enjoy exping or raiding too. EQ still has a lot of miles left in it for me. That doesn't mean I haven't taken break from time to time however, just that I am satisfied atm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uiskandaralazeem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iskandar Alazeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/17/02 11:00:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1152.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same any more</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>
<br>
Different people play for different reasons. Sucks not being able to be with your friends, but the problem is that everyone has friends. If everyone's friend was allowed to just join and hang out while killing stuff, as you said, you'd have a very large mass of people divided into cliques, as well as a lack of order and discipline, most likely. Standards aren't cool if you're the one being excluded, but they're a necessary evil.<br>
<br>
I'll say this; not all high-end guilds are just about scoring phat lewt. Loot is just part of the equation.<br>
<br>
I do sympathize, though. It's certainly a frustrating situation.<br>
<br>
And yeah, pick up raids have been around since the dawn of EQ. So have more exclusionary raids. In fact, I'm pretty damn sure the early raids of PoF, PoH, Nagafen, and Vox were very exclusionary at times. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uarkanissoulhart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arkanis Soulhart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/18/02 12:00:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1152.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same any more</span><hr size=1> &gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ifferent people play for different reasons.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yea, but I think the point was maybe alot of people started playing for one reason (the experience, fun, hanging out, raiding) and after playing for awhile, the mindset of alot of those people have changed to what she said.  <br>
<br>
I agree that the 'game' is what you make of it.  There is (obviously) a majority of people who enjoy the nature of the game (why else would they play).  Those who play just to have fun (read: casual) end up losing in the long run  not only due to the design, but to the players themselves.  There will always be powergamers who stay up all hours of the evening to either camp that epic piece, or go on that long raid to get that rarest of all items.  I agree that it compounds the problem when you have more and more 55+ players and they are all trying to get a slice of the same pie.  The problem is theres only so much pie to go around.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugruundythebiggreenbooger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gruundy the Big Green Booger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/18/02 1:38:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1152.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: not the same any more</span><hr size=1> I have to say that Eternus Solaris is NOT one of those &quot;uberguilds.&quot;  NOR is Nightstar Rising&quot;  (both of which are guilds I trust and respect fo the moct part. In ES, if you can't make it to a raid, then it's ok, and do so. In nightstar if you can't make it to a raid no prob.  ES really IS a family associated guild  NR is a guild DEVOTED to having &quot;FUN&quot; with eq...something I haven't seen in a LONG TIME of  this game.  If you want a guild where you don't have to worry about your lvl, what key you have or what GAY ASS loot you have  talk to an officer of Eternus Solaris  OR Nightstar Rising   &gt;^,,^&lt;  Thanks
