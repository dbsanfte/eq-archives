The Assassin was 31st level. ]<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
        Khasirath spent some time in Nektulos Forest, guarding and encouraging the young Tier’Dal with some well-timed attacks and small gifts. He often returned to this proving ground of youthful hate and vainglory between his hunts across the face of Norrath.<br>
<br>
        Finally his restlessness drove him Southward, through the deserts and swamps to his most recent battleground, the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule. And as he traveled, he spoke with an Initiate of the Flame, Vindaren by name. Something about this young Tier’Dal mage’s attitude was bothering the Emissary, and he was determined to root it out.<br>
<br>
        Vindaren had started the conversation by asking about the Flame’s system of punishments. This seemed suspicious to Khasirath. Why would one of Innoruuk’s Chosen, who should strive for Unity with his Brethren, need concern himself about punishments for misdeeds? And the Initiate’s flippant remarks once the punishments were described set Khasirath’s nerves on edge.<br>
<br>
        So Khasirath continued talking with the young mage, nudging the conversation along different lines to see what would get a rise from the Initiate. It quickly came clear that Vindaren was power-mad. He even said outright that we would willingly drive a dagger in any back for his own gain. And Khasirath knew he meant even the backs of the Flame of Hate.<br>
<br>
        Then Khasirath spoke of harnessing this hunger for power to keep the Initiate in line with the Flame, and more importantly, Innoruuk’s Will. That was the spur he’d needed. The mage became incensed, raving about how the Father had mistreated him, and how he hated Innoruuk and how he strove for power so that he could rise up to slay Him and take His place!<br>
<br>
        The Emissary tried briefly to reason with the mage, to show him the incredible genius of Innoruuk’s plan, but Vindaren proved as blind as a Halfling to the Father’s Will. In a rage, Vindaren admitted he planned to use the Flame to rise to power, and then discard them when another better way to power presented itself.<br>
<br>
        Finally the mage warily asked Khasirath when he planned to tell an Officer about what was said. With his jaw set and his eyes blazing with fury, Khasirath growled, “I AM an Officer!” This seemed a shock to Vindaren. He quailed a moment, trying to compose himself. Snapping back he insulted Khasirath, the Flame of Hate, and even Lord Vlekk before saying that he would be taking his leave since his plans had been discovered.<br>
<br>
        All but shaking with fury, Khasirath watched with some small satisfaction as the mage turned in his Initiate’s Tags. To think that someone, a Tier’Dal even, would so baldly lie about their allegiance to the Father, and try to use His Chosen for their own selfish gain! Khasirath wanted to see the fool pay. As he slunk off into the shadows, Vindaren promised that when next he and Khasirath met, only one would leave that meeting alive.<br>
<br>
        Cutting off contact with the mage, Khasirath plunged through the dank forest of the Feerrott. His whole being screamed with hatred that needed release, his muscles twitching with the desire to drive his axes into living, pulsing flesh, to feel the hot blood raining on his face, washing away the indignities suffered by the words of a young and power-blind mage.<br>
<br>
        He stalked into the Lost Temple in a rage, shouting out for companions to share the slaughter with. To Khasirath’s delight and satisfaction, his Brother Knight of Shadow Banlauk was there, and invited the Emissary to join him and his rag tag band of lizard hunters. Still too agitated to think clearly, Khasirath did not learn the names of the Dwarf, the Koada’Dal Cleric, the Bard in the guise of a Tier’Dal, or any of the others he fought beside that night. His thoughts were only on blood and hate, pain and vengeance. Every lizard he fought bore the face of a Tier’Dal mage.<br>
<br>
        The fighting was fast and furious as always in the Courtyard. They would draw lizards out from the maze, or help dispatch the screaming masses of lizards that would roil out from the other parts of the Temple, hot on the heels of panicked and wounded adventurers.<br>
<br>
        The hours of battle wore down Khasirath’s anger. Slowly the mage slipped to the back of his mind as the tides of reptiles were destroyed, the sweet tang of blood awash on the grass of the Courtyard. His party was just finishing off the last of four lizards they had pulled from the maze when Khasirath’s neck seemed to burn with a sense of impending danger. Spinning on his heel, his Iron Backed Axe raised in anticipation of more lizards to fight, Khasirath blinked at the sight before him, hesitating.<br>
<br>
        A Barbarian female dressed in dark armour and the ubiquitous polar bear head helm beloved by her unwashed tribe smiled grimly as she dashed forward, her two slim blades slicing forth like hungry lightning. Khasirath cursed and snarled as the assassin’s blades bit into him and the battle was joined.<br>
<br>
        “Vindaren must have sent this assassin,” Khasirath called out to his Brother Banlauk. Banlauk cursed roundly his inability to help as the skilled assassin drove into Khasirath with a fury.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath threw aside his large axe, unslinging the granite tomahawk and shield he preferred in a tough fight. But the barbarian far outstripped his skills, her attacks raining down with such speed and accuracy what the Emissary knew he had no hope of survival. But then he felt as much as heard the Bard’s powerful songs slip through his body, and felt the Cleric’s touch closing his terrible wounds. These lightblinded creatures he had battled alongside all night were defending him as best they could from the assassin’s attack.<br>
<br>
        While fighting the lizards, Khasirath had had to call upon the Father’s Touch, and knew it would be some time before Innoruuk would grant His Knight the use of His Hate again. His magical reserves and stamina were also on the wane, but he refused to run, refused to yield. His teeth bared in a wolf’s grin rictus he battled on, cursing the assassin, her employer, and his own inexperience.<br>
<br>
        The Bard’s songs enveloped his body in harmonics that actually were harming the Barbarian whenever she struck. He threw his spells with abandon, snarling with satisfaction as he saw the waves of nausea grip her; saw her slow as tendrils of darkness choked her movements. He even pulled the strength from the assassin’s muscles to feed his own failing reserves. But it was not enough. She seemed to shrug off most of the effects, and was frustratingly unharmed despite the long battle.<br>
<br>
        From all the slashes and stinging cuts to his body, Khasirath knew if not for the Cleric and Bard’s efforts, he would have died four times over. Yet he battled on, every conscious thought dissolving into the feral instinct of kill or be killed. A mob of lizards poured through the Courtyard, and Khasirath used the confusion to step through the shadows, appearing far behind the assassin. He drew upon his magical prowess and threw powerful waves of fear into the Barbarian, sending her running into the maze in a panic. He could only hope she would run into something large enough to kill her before his spell’s power shattered.<br>
<br>
        He collapsed in a corner of the Courtyard, his back firmly to the wall and tried to regain a bit of precious mana as his partners battled the lizards. He tasted his own blood on his lips, and felt a pounding burning pain through his entire being. Gasping for breath as the sweat steamed through cracks in his armour, he waited for death to come. Hr would not run away, no matter how hopeless the fight. And despite the odds, he felt no fear, only intense hatred.<br>
<br>
        He felt it when his enchantment on the Barbarian snapped, and struggled to his feet to face her. It seemed the long battle and the effects of the Disease Cloud were wearing her down for he could see she was now more wounded that he when she reappeared. But she was still so quick and deadly. Khasirath held no real hope, only an intense hate driven desire to put her in as much pain as he could before he fell. It was with amazement that he saw the small effects of his attacks and the Bard’s damage shields take their toll on the assassin. And the Cleric kept pumping life back into the Emissary’s failing body.<br>
<br>
        ‘Maybe I can hold her long enough to use the Father’s Touch,’ Khasirath realized. With a renewed fury he threw himself at his prey, striking with hate in every fiber of his being. He became oblivious to his own condition, the pain and exhaustion fading into the thrumming of the blood in his ears.<br>
<br>
        The assassin began to fall back, it seemed she had lost her taste for this prey as the hours stretched long. Never in Khasirath’s life had he fought a single opponent so long. As she backed towards the doors that led to the passage to the Feerrott, Khasirath stayed on her, growling with fury and hatred, his eyes glowing red with the blood-madness.<br>
<br>
        But then with a great volley of screams and oaths, a powerful gang of lizards stormed from the depths of the Temple, their powerful jaws and claws dripping with the flesh of the hunters they had just run down. Banlauk and the others were separated from Khasirath and the assassin, struggling to beat off the horde.<br>
<br>
        One lizard began ripping at Khasirath’s back as he drove the assassin towards the Feerrott, but he began to falter without the Cleric’s spells and Bard’s songs to assist him.<br>
<br>
        And then Khasirath felt the Father’s Hand brush over him, a deeply cold pleasure as his spirit opened to the power of his Lord. With a howl he leapt forward, grabbing the Barbarian’s shoulder with his shield hand, opening his being as a conduit to the Father’s own Hatred in a Touch that sent the assassin writhing with agony. But she did not fall! It was not enough. His triumphant howl turned to frustrated rage as wide-eyed he watched the assassin plunge both blades forward, under the protection of his collar and through his throat. Gurgling on his own hot blood he spat one last curse with his dying breath.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Khasirath found himself standing before a dark and brooding throne. It loomed before him, almost higher than he could see. And upon this throne sat his Lord, his Master. Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate. The immense figure leaned forward; it’s dark eyes glowing with the power of all the world’s Hate as the God peered deeply into Khasirath’s soul. The Knight stood stock still, a good soldier under his Commander’s review. He knew he had failed Him, and now must stand for his punishment.<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk reached forth with one long-fingered hand, a hand large enough to crush the Tier’Dal as a man might crush an annoying insect. Khasirath did not flinch, awaiting the Master’s Touch with devotion and acceptance. And when the fingertips brushed his brow, it was like the greatest agonies of all his life were whip lashing back upon him in one moment. This was the power of Pure Hate; this was his Master’s Will. The pain and Hate shrieked through every ounce of Khasirath’s spirit, the pain so great it should have killed him outright, but as he was already dead, there was no death to bring relief from this torture.<br>
<br>
        Twenty-one times the Lord touched Khasirath’s spirit with Hate, one time for every Gate he had passed; a reminder that all of his training and power should have been enough to keep him from failing his Lord. And each time, Khasirath’s own hate deepened. Hate not turned towards his Lord, for he knew this was Innoruuk’s Will, the way his Lord made certain that His creations were strong enough. This hate turned inward, towards his weaknesses that had allowed him to fail, and towards the enemies of Innoruuk who had brought him down.<br>
<br>
        Finally the punishment was complete, and Khasirath bowed before his Lord to show that he understood, and wished to be given the chance to serve further in life. His whole being sang with the Father’s Touch, and his own hate. His heart was full to bursting with a fierce devotion that some would almost call love if they could feel what Khasirath was feeling. But the Tier’Dal would never see his feelings in the light of that emotion. It was not in his nature to speak in such terms.<br>
<br>
        Innoruuk chuckled darkly, the sound purely in His Childe’s mind. The chuckle was like a thousand souls screaming for relief from their death throes, a thousand Feir’Dal babes burning alive. A shiver of pleasure almost brought Khasirath to his knees as he knew with certainty that his Lord was not done with him, and that he would be allowed to serve as His Knight of Shadow still, spreading His Hate and His Will across Norrath.<br>
<br>
<br>
        Khasirath snapped again to full awareness of himself. He was in Oggok and one of the large and simple creatures called Ogres was staring at him with open amazement.<br>
<br>
        “Wared youse come frum, lil inkie man?” the behemoth asked in a deep and slurred version of the Dark Speech.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath’s eyes narrowed, glowing sanguine from within. He stalked closer to the young Ogre, his motions like a great panther or wolf on the trail of prey.<br>
<br>
        Blinking in befuddlement, the Ogre opened his mouth to ask his question again, but Khasirath reached forward, his hand closing like a vise on the Ogre’s shirt collar and with a twist forcing the beasts head down level with his own.<br>
<br>
        “I am a Tier’Dal,” he growled with great fury in his low voice, the ogre flinching away from each word. “Not a ‘lil inkie man.’ And I have come from an audience with my God Innoruuk. I have business to attend to in His name, and I do not wish to be bothered by the likes of you!” As Khasirath spoke, his body seemed almost to grow larger, rising with the power of his Hate, and the residue of his Lord’s Hate. His hands began to radiate a cold blue-black power, a crackling dangerous aura that had the Ogre’s eyes rolling like a panicked horse’s. Khasirath reached up and placed his hand on the Ogre’s brow with a wolfish grin. The Ogre shrieked and convulsed as pure Hatred rolled through him, abrading his every nerve in raw pain.<br>
<br>
        Khasirath dropped the almost dead Ogre to the ground. The huge creature sobbed raggedly as the pain seemed to go on and on. Khasirath turned on his heel and strode out into the Feerrott to recover his corpse with a feral smile on his thin lips. <p>Khasirath S'Therik. <BR>
