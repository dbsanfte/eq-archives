<br>
Strategy - he is totally MR, so take tanks and healers. I would say 1 good group of high lvls (55 - 60) or 2 - 3 groups if levels differ quite a bit. Tanks are a must, clerics for obvious reasons *grins at her cleric friends* Druids are nice for regen and DS (telling you all the obvious I know), the more people the merrier, as I am fond of saying you can never have too much overkill! Nukers (mages, wizzies) pretty much useless due to his MR. Take an enchanter for clarity (telling you the obvious again I know, so spank me!).<br>
<br>
He has a lot of hit points, I am not a number person so not even going to guess at the amount.<br>
<br>
He is also a 24 hour spawn. I found him near Grik (?) the exile, so if you track Grik then track just in front of Grik you should find him, although he does wander some. I will try find you a rough loc and post it later if you get stuck.<br>
<br>
Good luck Vatticus, hope this helps!<br>

Had 21 people kill him today on Prexus, both enchanters that tried to Tash him were dead before I could target them for heals.  Only people useful for the actual fight were melee, pet classes, and healers.<br>
<br>
I'd say take 2 clerics, 8 tanks, 1 druid, and a chanter for haste and clarity only.  That's a minimum and they should all be 53+.  Add in mage and necro pets for faster results.<br>

More or less we let the 60 warrior tank the whole way (he was the only one healed during entire fight) as the second warrior, the bard, ranger, mage pet, rogue and 2 shaman pets melee.  The 2 Shamans &amp; 2 druids tossed in heals while the cleric med midfight.<br>
<br>
We had no sudden damage done or recieved.  Was a slow fight but almost flawless.  Advice: Try to pull him away from any water, as it's kinda rough beating him down while he runs at low health if he is slowly swimming away. <p><form method="POST" action="www.gucomics.com"><p>

-55 Warrior<br>
-32k HPs<br>
-Hits for 225's max, usually for mid 100's<br>
-Cannot be snared, rooted, tashed, slowed, nada sticks to him<br>
-Cannot be darkness dot'd, and no druid dots will stick <br>
-In order words, resists ALL spells except wizzies' lures<br>
-Heals himself, must be stunned by the tanks (at the beginning this was true, I'm hearing now he does not heal)<br>
-Summons <br>
-Will turn and run at about 20% hp, but runs fast since no snare can be landed<br>
 <br>
I've know he's been killed with one group consisting of 1 cleric, 2 tanks, 1 rogue and 2 wizzies.  But 2 groups are suggested.   <br>
<br>
Recommended groups are at least three tanks, a cleric, an enchanter and of course the druid Ulump is being killed for in group one; and a 2nd group with a few more healers (cleric and druid) to help keep the 3 main tanks healed, wizzies and/or tanks.  A 60 wiz was able to land all lures on him, not sure about the resist rate for lower levels though.   <br>
<br>
Since he summons and will resist any and all spells except the wizzie lures, don't even attempt to cast anything else on him other than the wizzie lures, you'll only end up summoned on top of him and waste the mana.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not he still CHs isn't sure.  I do know he used to, but most now have been saying he does not.  I'd suggest being prepared for it.<br>
<br>
Tanks should save their disciplines for the last 30% or so of the fight, when he'll start to run.  He starts to run one way for a few steps, then turns around and runs fairly fast the other direction.  There's no way to slow his running unfortunately.  <br>
 <br>
When he's been found up (or when he found others I should say) he was standing aound at -200 -1900.  He stands about knee deep in the water around that point and looks like any other froglok.    <br>
<br>
Above info was pulled from various posts here at the Druids Grove and from my own experiences with him and thank all druids who are so great about sharing info.<br>
<br>
<br>
My shot at him went like this:<br>
We took one group:  55 cleric, 56 druid, 54 chanter, 56 monk, 57 warrior, 52 rogue.  First attempt we all died (we had cleric camp out though in time), but we goofed in that attempt.  Chanter wanted to try something told not to and cast tash at the start which got him instantly summoned and killed as expected.  Second attempt had a 57 necro with pet also who happened to be walking by join us, but think we could have managed even w/o him the 2nd time after we learned from our mistake.  Chanter also charmed a frog to help.  Cleric did CH only on the main tank taking the most damage.  Druid spot healed the others as needed.  Cleric and druid were left with 70% mana remaining when Ulump was dead, went much much better, piece of cake really if you just plan on beating him to death and keep your tanks healed.<br>
<br>
I believe the early reports of him CHing himself might have actually been other frogs nearby healing him, as no one has seen him CH since the beginning.  If possible, make sure you pull him away from other casting frogs, they can join in and help.  Another warning, if anyone coming to meet up with you agro's another frog around Ulump, he will join in the fight, catching you unbuffed for the big fight.  Keep sow on your tanks for when he might try to run off towards the end of the fight.<br>

We were totally unprepared (read no buffs and only one group formed up) and we were still able to kill him, although we were definately on the border of losing. We had no deaths amazingly considering our breakdown was 52 war, 55 sk, 52 pally, 53 pally, 52 ranger, two 55 cleric, two 55 necro, 50 mage, 58 wizzie and 4 druids 54-58. Highest tank was 55 and we still took him down with no deaths, Like I said it was a close fight, but if we actually had time to buff (read symbol and rune) he wouldn't have been too bad.<br>

Oh and also dont try and pull him its a pain. we were tring to pull him at the start but every time the puller went over the water ulump would just start to run away tring to find a way around the water.

For 2nd try then our monk decided to pull him up into the caves where no other frogs could possibly join/help and it worked great, he had no trouble pulling him into the caves.<br>

<br>
Ulump has 32,000 Hp, Lure Spells hit for full.<br>
<br>
He doubles for 225 from what i saw.<br>
<br>
The group i took was this: 51 Druid(Me), 60 Monk, 57 Warrior, 55 Cleric, 54 cleric, and a 51 Ranger.<br>
<br>
This was probably the closest fight i'd seen in eq. As soon as the clerics ran out of mana, the warrior died, luckily at 3/5th's life ulump started running and the monk finished him off. Only use complete heals, dont mess with short heals, its a waste of mana. If you dont have a mage, use legacy of spike of mostly tanks, or shield of thorns if only like 2 tanks.<br>
