It is incomplete and a little choppy but I plan to edit and finish it next week.  Here is what I have so far:<br>
<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
  &quot;Argh!” Bryndar thought as he sat up this morning.  The sunrise was brightly shining through the window of his training alcove and seemed to pierce his skull though his eyes.  He was covered in sweat and his head ached.  “By the Light, will these dreams never stop!”<br>
<br>
  Again the same dreams of huge metal beasts and humans plagued Bryndar.  They appeared so real that he was convinced some evil had carried him straight to Hell.<br>
  <br>
  Bryndar sat on the edge of his cot, mindlessly playing with a piece of straw ticking that was protruding from his mattress.  He thought about the dreams and what meanings these strange fantasies might hold.  Last night, he was wandering around what appeared to be a city.  But it was like no other city he had ever seen or even heard about in the libraries of the Academy.  Buildings stretched far into the sky and huge metal beasts were roaming the streets between, stopping every now and then to disgorge humans.  The beasts reminded him of the mechanical constructs of the gnomes, but on scales that even a gnome would scarce believe.  <br>
  <br>
Bryndar remembered being loosely aware that this was normal, but sitting here now the thoughts and images of his dreams unnerved him.  “Why did I not feel nervous in these macabre dreams,” he wondered, “Surely these abominations were not natural.”<br>
  <br>
The morning bell rang just then, jarring Bryndar from his pondering.  <br>
  <br>
“Hurry Bryn,” yelled Deidre as she ran past his door on her way to the kitchen for morning feast.  The feisty redheaded wizard apprentice always brought a smile to Bryndar’s face, especially during the evening dark.<br>
  <br>
“Ah,” he thought, “I had better get ready for studies lest Jraker should question me again.”  The thoughts of his teacher probing his mind made Bryndar queasy.  He had never gotten used to the mind probes after breakfast.  Plus there was the fact that he hated to be embarrassed and losing one’s meal to a simple mind query was definitely something the other neophytes would heckle him about. <br>
<br>
  <br>
Bryndar sat quietly in the Library, oblivious to his surroundings.  He was here today looking for tidbits of information.  The other students laughed at him, saying he should join them in their revelry on his day off.  “Loreseeker” was the title the others had given him, mainly as a word to ridicule him for spending all of his spare time in the research libraries.  But he liked being surrounded by these ancient tomes and scrolls.  Reading of lost civilizations and histories intrigued him.  He hoped one day to discover some of the untold treasures that lay hidden throughout the world but eluded discovery without the diligent study of these texts.<br>
  <br>
“So young Bryn,” Jraker said as he walked into the library, “what are we studying today?  I hope you have been working on mastering those cantrips that your classmates deem worthless.”<br>
  <br>
Jraker was a kind instructor but he was almost oppressive in his constant drilling of spell theory and mastery.  He was different from the other teachers in that he was Erudite, while not being rare to Freeport, he was definitely unusual.<br>
  <br>
“And a damned perfectionist,” Bryn chuckled silently at the thought.  More than a few students had received a scathing from Jraker’s tongue for not properly setting up their spells or the lack of studying.<br>
  <br>
“Well, sir” Bryn told Jraker, “I was just looking into the histories of some of the ruins surrounding Qeynos.  It seems that there might be a few artifacts worth looking for around there.”<br>
  <br>
“Hehe, your fellow comrades would say that you are heading towards being a ‘lich’.  I think they are trying to tell you to get some sun,” laughed Jraker.  “Come, let us go outside as I have need of some help.  Your talents are being wasted here as a scribe.”<br>
  <br>
While Bryndar cared little for leaving the library, he still longed to actually search for some of the relics he had uncovered in his studies.  He wanted to be able to prove that he was correct and, secretly, to prove the others wrong about him. <br>
  <br>
“This would be good,” he thought.  Maybe a chance to show off one of the new spells he had learned.<br>
