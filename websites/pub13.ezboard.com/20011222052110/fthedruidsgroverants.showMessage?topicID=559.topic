<br>
1. Us druids weren't put on the game nor did we choose this class to go around giving Sow and buffs to everyone that asks. When I am asked nicely I don't mind giving (of course a few pp also helps).<br>
<br>
2. When I go back to Kelethin for whatever MY reasons are, it doesn't include PLing a newbie wether they ask or offer to pay, I just won't do it. I worked hard for my levels and died many times to get them.<br>
<br>
3. If you ask me for something and I tell you I am busy, saying anything other than &quot;sorry for bothering you&quot; or similar effects is totally uncalled for. If you want stuff for free, join a guild and hope that they are as nice as the folks in mine (Vigilant Order (Povar). I have several items that I would not be able to get at my level (25) that were given to me out of kindness for I did not ask for them with the exception of my springwood club. I noticed my guildleader was in Karnor and I sent her a tell asking if she looted one to hold on to for me and she said ok.<br>
<br>
Now I have a little story to tell about being pestered, it goes like this:<br>
<br>
I had gone back to Kelethin to see what was on sale in Faymart because I had saved up a few hundred pp. While I was there I sent a shout offering SoW, buffs, and binding for donations. That was when I ran into the begining of my migraine that day. I got a tell from a lvl 3 or 4 noob wanting to know how much for sow and buffs, I told him just donations...no set price. He said he was at the orc lift so I agreed to meet him there. I gave him my lvl 24 skin and strength buffs along with sow and he donated 5gp (probably all he had at that lvl). After waving goodbye to him and wishing him luck I headed back to the bank. Within a few minutes I get another tell from him asking me to PL him. I told him no, I had other things to do. He kept begging and begging and then found me at the bank and started with his /rude at me. I said &quot;here you are asking me for something and giving me a rude gesture...go away&quot;. He continued with this crap for about 10 minutes really pissing me off, finally I gave him 5pp and told him &quot;sorry, I'm busy... go away&quot;. He did and in the proccess made me 5pp poorer but it enabled me to play the game instead of working for someone else.<br>
<br>
For the guy in one of these posts that said druids are lazy...I didn't spend $30 on this game and $50 to play it for 6 months to help people like you achieve your goals. Mana is not free...it cost time and time is exp, so, if you want something from me you better make it worth while. A simple please and thank you sometimes is all you need, especially after being pestered by rude, ignorant people all day.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time :rollin<br>

There are people I started playing with that are warriors and rangers that are now many lvls above me because I have gotten trapped in a cycle of helping others achieve their goals. My previous post wasn't aimed at the folks that are polite or offered something in return it is aimed at the people that sit there and pester or give a hard time because I am too busy at that moment to drop everything and help them.<br>

Few tips for ya:<br>
<br>
1.  Stay Anon in Cities.  (A Must)<br>
2.  When possible, go get a full set of Gnome Skin<br>
3.  Get Claws if you can, I got mine from Bargynn in Kurns Tower.<br>
4.  Buy a Parrying Dagger in Rivervale.<br>
5.  Wear all this and go anon, MUCH less people will know you're a druid, and you won't be hassled nearly as much. <br>
<br>
I love to PL, but only when I wanna.  And since I'm in a fairly active guild I don't get to do so very often.  Anyways, good luck, and I hope you make the stay to level 60. :)<br>

you were sitting in GF looking to buy stuff, it cost you nothing.  You gripe about people begging, and then you want money to cast a few buffs.<br>

Check out our dd and dot spells bro, even at 50+ they aren't as strong as other casters, so yes...I do believe that the port, sow, and buff spells are our money makers.<br>
<br>
It takes longer for us to lvl than say a ranger, rogue, warrior, or monk that doesn't have to sit down and med so we can fight again. Our melee is about 2 lvls above beeing completely worthless and to add to all that we are expected to sow and buff anyone that asks? I don't think so. I don't mind doing it when I am asked nice (and that means with a please, not gimme sow). I just don't like it when 70% of my game time is spent sowing, buffing, and medding for other people...I want to get my druid lvl'd too.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uelexiaraindancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elexia Raindancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/6/01 10:25:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sow, buffs, and PLing</span><hr size=1> Ok i'll add my rant to this as I am a 49th level dru.  One point that was made to me last night specifically was that mana is free and therefore the buffs and the gates should be free.  This is a load of bull, mana is not free, it costs time, time to med, time to buff, time to med again.  If you have 15 different chars asking you for buffs and such you are out of mana most of the time.  So for this rant I will lay down basically what it costs me in plat to buff ppl or pl someone....<br>
<br>
Lets start with skin like nature, 300 mana, then str, another 85, sow another 40, and a chloro which is another 200 mana.   What does that all add up too?  625 mana, contrary to an apparently popular belief, you have to med to gain mana back.  I have a total mana of 1960 (49th level, wis 190), so that is a third of my mana that I would have cast on one person, if they had there way...  It takes me a full 20 minutes of playtime to gain back full mana from oom, and if I have people constantly telling and aking me for sow and other buffs, that 625 turns into even larger numbers (i'm not counting heals and resists even), throw in gates that cost 300 and we are starting to talk about some serious time wasted cause you have to sit and med and wait for you mana to come back so you can go off on your merry way.  In short a druid can make about 100pp per 15 minutes of gate time, now if you buff 3 peeps with your highest power stuff, you have just wasted 20 minutes of your time, and about 100 or so plat cause you could have done 20 minutes of gating for cash.<br>
<br>
So you tell me, is mana free?  I think not, especially not to a druid.<br>

I agree that the first post about being begged to be plvl'd, thats just wrong.  If someone is doing that to you, you should have them face east, and pay their dues to your diety by targetting you and typing /due.  Now this is quite painful to them sometimes, but then again, think of the annoyances they caused, if you were still unable to get out of it using /ignore.  If they have played long enough they would understand what typing that /due meant (hehe, i.e. duel) then they should understand just what they are asking for.  I personally have not had to do this yet as I don't have a buffer character, just my monk (I'm getting to be able to buff people some though :)), but I would find this acceptable if they are being an ass.<br>
The only other thing that would be fun to do is cast Dark Pact or another of the Necro spell line and watch them, if only you could cast that on others :)  Now that would be fun to watch :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uainalda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ainalda</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/8/01 5:42:08 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.aredhel.ch/eq/atk.jpg width=103 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sow, buffs, and PLing</span><hr size=1> As soon I enter Greater Shoutdark or any other n00ber zone, I usualy do <br>

NO body was takeing me into any groups, and one guy was telling me i needed to plevel him for free over tells. It was at that time i said This is Stupid. <br>
<br>
Alright you people look at this in the way of PP we could earn in that time. How about the fact i pay 10 bucks to play this game a month, and if i plevel or buff or just sow somebody thats money i just payed for them not me. I am not as jaded as i was at younger levels because i stay away from most groups of people. I never buy food or water i forage it all. If i need to sell i do it at the rings and when i need a bank i run in and run out no stopin for nobody. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong i still buff or even Plevel people for free all the time (mostly when i see somebody trying to solo because nobody else will group with or is there to help) but even then i have been burned i gave somebody some nice equipment and he turned around and /ruded me and ran off say something about me being mentaly screwed up (wonderful guy i know)<br>

First thing you did wrong: /auc Sows Buffs binds for donations!<br>
 1) makes you look greedy, which I believe you are<br>
 2) shows you have free time and mana on your hands<br>

Dang are you sure youre sitting down when you think your medding? As to the whole pling sowing buffing fracas I just have to say I dont understand why druids are the be all end all of buffing and sowing. Shamen get sow at 9 and have honestly much better buffs than a druid gets. Despite this Ive had people walk up to me when im grouped with a shaman whos my level or higher ignore them and bug me for buffs. Im tempted to create a new name for my char something like jobaner or anything else that sounds like a pet name so I can wolfform and pretend to be a pet lol. /gaurding with my life .. oh splendid one.<br>
