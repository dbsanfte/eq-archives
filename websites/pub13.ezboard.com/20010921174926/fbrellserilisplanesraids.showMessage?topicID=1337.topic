There is a push to resolve what exactly should be reservable and clear up the grey area that is the &quot;intentions&quot; boards.<br>
<br>
Here is what I think should be reservable that isn't currently:<br>
<br>
Kedge Keep (Phinny (epic piece))<br>
Hole (Tower for epic pieces)<br>
City of Mist (lords (epic pieces))<br>
Chardok (Royalty (altogether until such time Chardok is camped more (epic pieces))<br>
Plane of Growth (2 day reservable with restrictions (seperate discussion?))<br>
<br>
All other areas throughout Norrath are to be treated with the normal FCFS playstyle until such time that this list needs to be amended.<br>

If someone's just doing a run through the reavers, you could technically have 5 raids an evening.  To limit it to 1 group per evening seems rather silly when it's easy to cooperate enough to have a few raids in 1 night.<br>
<br>
Ditto with the Royals.  There's 3 of them.  Group 1 needs 3 princes, 2 kings &amp; a queen.  Group 2 needs 1 prince &amp; 2 kings.<br>
<br>
I know when I did the DG Chardok raid we probably weren't able to kill Prince, King &amp; Queen every 2 hours.  We could probably manage a prince &amp; king in 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Anyways, what I'm saying is that cooperation is quite possible, and can work well.<br>
<br>
The hole is almost never raided.  If 2 groups need the same items, perhaps then can even go in together.  Or one will start earlier than the other, then the 2nd will go in.  The spawns on them isn't excessive.<br>
<br>
Phinny is only a single mob with an 8 hour spawn.  He's very easy to kill with a small number of people.  He's often up.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about the cleric in Neriak for the Enchanter epic.  The spawn is LONGER than 8 hours, and she's as hard to kill as Phingel.  She's needed for the epic quest.  Should she be reservable too?<br>
<br>
I'd like to see Sky changed, to be more open to multiple raids.  Instead of having a single Friday-Sunday raid, there can be a raid that starts on Thursday, &amp; continues on Friday.  Even a 2nd raid that starts on Saturday but later on.  Even Sunday-Monday raids.  It requires a greater level of communication, but it's certainly possible.<br>
<br>
For growth, I like the idea of weekends reserved.  The difference is that I'd like to see raids every day.  Yes, it KNOW the repop is 30 hours.  Here's how it works.<br>
Monday: They clear 60% of the zone, leaving 40% up.<br>
Tuesday: They go in, 40% is up.  They start clearing.  By the time they're down to the last 10% of zone, other stuff is repopping.  They kill a chunk of the repops, and leave.  Repeat daily.<br>
Monday, Tues, Wed, &amp; Thurs each clear 60% of the zone.<br>
With every other day raids, say one on Monday &amp; Wednesday.  Monday's clears 80% of zone.  Wednesday's clears 90% of the zone.<br>
<br>
Usage over 4 days with daily raids: 240%.<br>
Usage over 4 days with every other day raids: 170%.<br>
<br>
And that's IF a weeknight raid clears 80 or 90% of the zone, which I find unlikely.  With daily raids, more people get to go to the plane, or more often.<br>
<br>
Leave Monday-Thursday open for people to go in.  The only request is that they don't raid for more than 10 hours.  Friday, Saturday, &amp; Sunday are reservable, 3 weeks in advance.  Same idea.  Raid for 10 hours, clear what you can, be courteous, and don't clear more than 60% of the plane. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 2/8/01 1:36:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>  Posts: 1761<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/8/01 2:44:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/itsme.jpg height=153 width=142></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *** Discussion **** What should be reservable?</span><hr size=1> Disagree with any of them being reservable.<br>
<br>
Phin is an 8 hour spawn and can be killed by a group of 6 level 50s (and despite your claims, Merry Band did it pre kunark too)<br>
<br>
Hole is like a 30 min spawn, WHY would you want to reserve a 30 min spawn?<br>
<br>
All 3 City of Mist lords can be done by 1 group and are like 2 hour respawns.<br>
<br>
All 3 Chardok Royals have a 2 hour respawn.<br>
<br>
Plane of Growth is large enough to support multiple groups.<br>
<br>
The fact is that all 5 places you listed have no one there most of the time, if it's not being used at full capacity or even 25% capacity what's the point? <p>nillon<br>

<br>
Have a reservation system for those times that you can squeeze in the mobs. <br>
<br>
For example: <br>
<br>
For Phinny, if the first person on a Saturday schedules him for noon, then the next group can schedule at 8pm. (If they're the second group on that day, then they may want to allow some certain amount of time since the first group WILL have to actually kill the mob.. and that takes time.)<br>
<br>
However, even moderate communication between the two groups will make doing him twice in one day far better than waiting a whole day!<br>
<br>
So, on any mob that has a multiple spawn/day issue, allow the reservations to be decided for that day by the first person to post their times.<br>
<br>
However, on the POG issue, I really don't know how splitting the spawns up like that would work at all. Perhaps if it's that large, you break up PoG for left and right halves, and you can reserve half the zone, instead of the whole zone, for one day. I just feel if you go with &quot;killing a chunk of the repops&quot; it'll lead to a ton of Rants.<br>
<br>
With COM and Chardok royals.. again, make it so that they can be reserved more than once in a day.<br>
<br>
On any other spawn that's got a large repop time (like the cleric) it should be presented to the VTG if it will be reservable or not.<br>

No reason at all to reserve these.  They are largely untouched.  They are a really quick respawn (relative to the BOSS mobs we do schedule).  The argument can be made that &quot;So what then reserving them won't matter then.&quot;  Well that argument can be made for every critter in the game.  Nothing is really gained by reserving these.  They are so widely uncontested and free it is just another layer of control that will yield little return on effort to schedule.  <br>
<br>
Sure they have epic pieces but the epic pieces are (possibly) coming into the world on these within as little as 2hrs and at most 8hrs.  I would say 2 weeks is a very reasonable time to get a epic piece in the grand scheme of things.  Some of these will have potentialy spawned 168 quest pieces in just that two week period.  The worst case (phinny?) will yield 42 potential drops in just that two week period.  I just don't see the OPPORTUNITY for getting these pieces slipping questers by because they are not scheduled which means epic pieces on these is a bad reason to schedule them IMO. <br>
<br>
That leaves POG.  POG has it's own discussion so I will refrain from rehashing all the proposed solutions here.<br>

I would be interested in exploring reservations for only 1 day a week, like friday for some of these zones, (except POG where the separate discussion seems to be making good progress).<br>
<br>
Anything more than this seems overkill, and I'd do this on a strict 2 month trial basis.  Anything that doesn't have at least 50% reservations comes off the list at the end of the time.<br>
<br>
At the same time, I would CONVERT fire giants to this same format.  The argument that they are a good training ground is valid, but reservability doesn't need to be 7 days a week to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
I'm in favor of a small window of reservability, if necessary, and leave the rest open.  If demand becomes sufficient in a particular area, we could start adding time, or spots, but I'd like to start at the low end and add as necessary rather than the other way around.<br>

Don't mess with every other hunting ground, think of the amount of resources wasted right now and the much larger amount that would be wasted with the addition of those mobs being reservable, no thanks.  Some people like to do spur of the moment things now and then.  And no it's not just large guilds, all of the places you listed can be done with small guilds, take Darkguard for example. <p><br><font face="Arial" size="-2">Vumil Darksoul<br>

<br>
All of the above listed reservables are a RAID type environment for the average guild (i.e. not SR). While Phinny can be done with one group, he usually isn't. I have yet to see a single group do all 3 COM lords, however the samething still applies. For most everyone it's a raid type environment.<br>
<br>
For most guilds, planning these raids takes a few days to get people to commit to them. The reason I would promote these areas being reservable is so that the average guild doesn't have to spend the time and energy to get a raid together and then show up to an empty spawn.<br>
<br>
Hole spawns aren't 30 mins for Epics. Keeper of the Tomb is a daily spawn. Kirn I believe is 2 hours. I don't know the spawn time on the enchanter ghost however. This is also a raid type environment in any case.<br>
<br>
The idea of coordinating 18 to 36 people, while easy for some of us who have been doing it as standard practice for quite awhile, is NOT easy for the average guild today, even with mostly 50+ level players. I ask that you think about it from their perspective. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

If it isn't on a spawn timer of in excess of 24 hours, the planes being the sole exception, it shouldn't be reservable.<br>
<br>
If it is on a timer that long, then it should be reservable. <p><BR>

It is not hard to put together a raid on these mobs.  Too many rules will just mean the downfall of the entire system, you're trying to make us come look at the boards when we want to do almost anything, that is ridiculous. <p><br><font face="Arial" size="-2">Vumil Darksoul<br>

I think one day a week to reserve these places is not out of line.  And then monitor to see if it actually gets used by any of the guilds who coordinate.  If not, pull it off.<br>
<br>
And I'd favor making Fire giants the same.<br>

<br>
there is too much &quot;reserving&quot; going on, you only &quot;reserve&quot; what absolutely has to be reserved, no more.If there is not enuff desire to do naggy the 1 time a week he spawns, then dont have it reserveable.The only time something should be reserveable is when demmand exceeds supply, and the mob/place is in a difficult location to get to. Something like the ghould lord or the AC does not apply, whereas naggy does.Long spawn time, difficult location and requires large numbers of people (about 4 groups) and where supply exceeds demmand. These are the things that should be reserveable, because by being reserveable it benifits everybody as they are being utilized with maximum efficiency.<br>
 To make anything else reserveable is to create monopolizeation from a few, and deny them to the casual gamer who cant be online constantly so they can have a shot. As I have said less in this case is best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucartumandua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cartumandua</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tunare's Tough Love</span><br>  Posts: 564<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/9/01 1:42:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *** Discussion **** What should be reservable?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Well, the whole beginning of this thread serious was because people were saying they were getting ranted on for stepping on &quot;intentions&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think the perfect comeback to this is. &quot;X day is scheduleable.  run you raid then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the ranting and harassing that is so annoying to people will just continue.<br>

People will complain you killed Kern the evening before and therefore messed up their hole raid the next day.  Then you will have people camping the forums to sign up for Chardok.  That is just silly.<br>
<br>
If you justify these by saying you need 18 people or so.  Then you might as well add just about every zone in velious.  Seriously there is few places in the whole expansion that one group can handle well.  I would prefer to not double the amount of reservations to keep track of.  We would also have to modify the rules so you can be on more then two lists.  Cripes I don't wanna give up a trakanon rotation just so I can schedule a mob that spawns every 2hrs and can be killed by 6 people.<br>
<br>
All of these go too far imo.  If we reserve these based on this type of criteria.  Then you can justify about 30 more raids of similar scope and spawn schedule.  I really don't feel like having 40 or 50 reservation threads which would be easily achieved if we use this sort of acceptance criteria.<br>
<br>
Fear and Hate and Fire Giants are treated special because they are special.<br>
<br>
The others are serious uber-mob encounters.<br>

No reason at all to reserve these&gt;<br>
<br>
I've seen so many rants over the spoiling of Phinny &quot;intentions&quot;.<br>
<br>
It was ruined &quot;phinny intention&quot; raid that seemed to be the last straw for Goat with the current vote about the Intentions raid.<br>
<br>
I agree that Phinny is up often but it's practically impossible for a lowbie 40s guild to plan a day for him.<br>
<br>
The less people you need for Phinny the less time you need to get organized.<br>
<br>
Using Merry Band as an example of how 60 lvl50s can take him is an unfair comparison.<br>
<br>
MB hunted in KK for months -- and I'm sure they attended a few *larger* phinny raids before they did their own attempts.<br>
<br>
If Phinny was reservable people would *not* be booking him 7x24.<br>
<br>
People also forget that there are many who do not have any of the game expansions.<br>
<br>
I don't see why people are so opposed.<br>

<br>
Except for Plane of Growth, which really needs to be hashed out (on the other thread).<br>
<br>
Phinny seems to be a bone of contention (the same way the FGs are) in so far as you have 1 or 2 groups of 50+ who can do him, and 3 to 5 groups of 40-50s who do him. There aren't too many zones set up like this and you add in an 8 hour spawn, it makes for a very frustrating raid attempt when your guild fields x-number of players only to find that a group of high levels has swooped in and nabbed him (same goes for the FGs).<br>
<br>
Vumil: I disagree. Me and you can field a raid through tells in a short period of time. Not everyone else can. As a matter of fact, MOST others can't. Again, try to put this into a bit of perspective. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)
