I've heard about this quest quite a bit but never really looked at the details until now.  As I was reviewing the components required and assessing the difficulty with which it would take to acquire the various pieces it went something like this: easy, easy, too easy, easy, uh oh...hmm...  Of course I'm refering to the fingerbone piece deep in kedge.<br><br>There appear to be two philosophies. The first is to arrive in overwhelming forces, kill everything and take down the sea horses and phinny.  Yeah, this could work but let's face it, very few people really know kedge inside and out and considering the pathing issues and what not, what would overwhelming be?  Two full groups of inexperienced 50s?  Three full groups?<br><br>The second is to try and do it solo in a 'drive by' sort of way. You park a mule in Dagnor's with corpse run supplies or recruit a ranger friend: cloudy potions, enduring breath, sow, and possibly a vision enhancing item since it's supposedly dark in that area (would it matter to a high elf?).  You then strip your main and head in with EB, cloudy and sow up and head for phin's room con'ing as you go for stuff that can see through invis. <br><br>Once in phin's room, if he's up, you're most likely going to get agro'd and killed, so you make a dash for the fingerbone and then swim up to the &quot;ledge&quot; where you allow yourself to be killed. Thus, when you do your corpse run you won't agro the sea horses or phinny the next time around. <br><br>Then you just bring up your mule, transfer some items and go get your corpse. <br><br>A variation on this, if phinny is down, is to use a gate potion, which I have (thurg), in his room if you get by the horsies non-agro'd, <br><br>I will probably try method 2 to see if it's doable since it sounds very mission impossible style, zipping past mobs under invis and then gating out like James Bond, all the while the air is running out. <br><br>The next question I have is about killing the Reverant.  He's level 50 but undead, I assume, so could he be realistically duo'd by a paladin and cleric keeping him feared?  If not, what kind of a force will I need for him.<br><br>Lastly, if *do* decide to put together a raid force for this, what other good loot can I sell my guildies on?  I have a firm belief that quest or not, every raid should attempt to provide something for everyone as much as possible.  The swirlspine belt might be nice alternative to the eternally camped fbss, but anything else?<br><br>Thanks in advance.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukronadin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kronadin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/19/02 4:16:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3399.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.liwest.at/keiser/eqpics/song24465.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Might: General Patton or James Bond?</span><hr size=1> What I did back in the days was go down into kedge with a druid friend.

Here is my advice on getting the KK bone by yourself.<br><br>First buy 4 invis potions (prolly over kill but those damn things wear off to fast sometimes) and 2 EB potions and zone in.  Depending on your sever, Phinny will most likely be down.  On veeshan he is never up for more than an hour it seems.  You should be able to tell if hes up because you will get the message, &quot;phingy begins to cast a spell&quot; even just sitting at the entrance. To be honest if phingy is up, just come back another time, no point dying (which you will if hes uo)<br><br>Get a good map if you dont know your way, and swim to the ledge. (at this point ultra vision can be helpfull).  Now people will swear up and down that some of the horsies can see invis.  There has been some discussion that they can see camo but not invis (I have no data on this so wont comment, everytime I have gone, horsies cant see invis).  But in any case just con each one, and see if the can see.  Somewhere out there is the exact loc of the bone.  SOrry dont have it handy at work, but you swim down to the left (facing off the ledge) and its on a big rock.  It can be hard to see, so dont panick.  Grab the bone, re invis and swim out.  <br><br>It really was that easy for me on 3 occasions.  My biggest piece of advice is dont bother trying when phinny is up (also if one of the horsies see invis, also come back another time).  I have seen so many posts of people dying 3 times ect just to get this piece.  If you take your time and do it right you should be able to get it no deaths and solo.  I found this quest kinda fun, so enjoy it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujcasetn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jcasetn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/02 11:08:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3399.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Divine Might: General Patton or James Bond?</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info.

Even then it's still a pain in the butt to take down Phin and get the bone without getting agroed by the seahorses (which by the way spawn real quick)<br><br>After several &quot;I almost had it in my hands but got whacked&quot; episodes, here's what I did....<br><br>Found a necromance, bought a coffin, bought some invis potions.  Went to kedge.  Necro did DMF (no more breathing problems).  Drank an invis potion.  Swam to phins room.  (he was up by the way)  Snuck to the upper right corner from the entrance to phins room.  Followed the crease of the wall down in to the star shaped hole in the floor in the centre of the room and proceeded to look for the bone.  (it's on top of a rock in the star shaped hole by the way)  This is about when Phin agroed me.  Kept swimming around.  Found the bone.  <br>Got stunned, spun and blasted to death before I could pick up the bone.  Ok... so it wasn't a perfect plan...  Nothing more frustrating than spinning to death while looking down at the thing you came for....<br>Anyway...<br>Caught a ride back to Kedge  Bought another coffin on the way.  Had my corpse summoned.  Left an item so I could get an xp rez.  DMF.  Invis potion.  Swim to Phins room.  This time I new more or less where the bone was.  Swam down.  Got it.  Agroed Phin on the way.  After getting the bone, I sat and waited, rather impatiently this time, for Phin to finish me off.  Hitchhike to Kedge, summon corpse, get rez for two corpses.<br><br>This may not sound like fun. But beleive me, after MONTHS of this little item seeming out of reach.  And many many attempts to do it the old fashioned way of killing everything in sight.  This is definitely they easiest and quickest way to get this thing.  You may even be able to do it the first try.  (I panicked)<br><br>Oh yeah.  If phin isn't up, you might not even die.  But then you gotta swim back out.

However, not one of them see through my invis and I was able to make my way to the bottom of the star-shaped pit. That was when my invis was stripped somehow and I was torn apart by the seahorses. I tried again, taking caution to con each seahorses and found it safe. Again, my invis was somehow stripped by something in the pit. I managed to prob about a little and noticed a tiny innocent fish named &quot;shimmering sailfish&quot; which I was able to confirm that thing was breaking by invis by drinking an invis potion and approaching it gradually. <br><br>The &quot;run in invis and grab&quot; method is not for the faint of heart for the simple reason that the bone is hard to locate by someone who is doing it the first time. I still advise pally friends to take the safe approach and have the seahorses and Phin taken down before trying.<br><br>As for the Revenant, I took it down easily with the following makeup: 50 pally, 50 ranger, 50 druid, 53 chanter, 40ish druid. It was, in fact, such an overkill that I was a little embarassed pulling everyone along. :P<br><br>Llaine<br>52 Paladin<br>Innoruuk <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showPrevMessage?topicID=3399.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showNextMessage?topicID=3399.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3399.topic&index=13><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.emailToFriend?topicID=3399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.threadControl?topicID=3399.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3399.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3399.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Old World<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">New World<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests>Holy Quests</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
