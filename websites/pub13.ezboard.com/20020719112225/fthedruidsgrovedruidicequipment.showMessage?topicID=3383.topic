Druids dont really need to get money. Heres my advice... Get to level 34 and PORT!! On saryrn you get anywhere from 10-25pp a port. Bind yourself in nfp and make a message Porting to most druid rings for donations. And just watch the pps rise up. You can make around 1k a day (8 hours or so) better then selling any mammoth tusks. <p><div align="center">

Bind yourself in FV.  At 29, you have the most popular ports for light races.  You don't even have to advertise.  Peeps are  always asking for ports off Kunark.  Just go about your normal hunting routine.  At the end of your day, gate to FV for about 1/2 hour or so and watch the Plat roll in.<br>

Besides porting to make money, go on raids. I won the roll on the necro/sk spell summon corpse and sold it the next day for 1k. That same raid earned me about 250pp in my split.<br>

don't go for any expensive items.  Your to young and you will get more out of a lot of little items.<br>

if your in a guild.  Find a jeweler that can sell you stuff at cost.  There are some +6 wis rings you can get 2 of.  Then you have 2 bracers that you can get cheap.  <br>
<br>
go to one of the item websites www.eqprices.com is a good one.  Then pick a slot, and driud and start looking.  make a chart of items you have, items you would want in order of price and write down what you will get.  <br>

... leading to a wis of 162-172 or so (1000ish mana at level 30), depending how you allocated your starting points and what race you are.  Most of the above items are pretty common and so you should be able to get them for roughly the prices I listed, depending on your server.  Just look at the wis and cost and the equipment you currently have and figure out what would be the best upgrade for you.... <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

<br>
My wis (with Paw in hand) is up to 186 .. but .. until level 37 or so it was less than yours .. and was only just enhanced (during level 41) from about 145 or so to its current level - and only by equipment I acquired solely on my own - no twinking .. no buying (except I had to pay to buy components for jewellry). <br>
<br>
You are fine the way you are. I know it might be a bit slower to level (though only if you lazily solo as I do - in a group I would imagine you can go with the flow of the group and do fine on that score as well).  <br>
<br>
The point is .. you don't need anywhere as much as you think you do .. as a druid anyway.  Don't be influenced by all you read here on the boards and see in game - by people who are into the 'equipment is king' mode.  The second point is .. have fun and don't worry. Things come in time .. and your time will come sooner than you think .. when you can begin questing for equipment.  <br>
<br>
I have no money to speak of even at this level, though I do have a bit of equipment that I can neither sell or wear (for instance, stormfeather talons which I got myself killing Stormfeather) - no one wants to buy them though they are super for the classes who could use them - at midlevels.  People are saturated with equipment these days .. so many choices .. so much affluence .. but don't worry about them .. think about your fun value.  You can do just about anything you want to do .. in time. <br>
<br>
Have fun.  Do things as cheaply as you can for now .. and don't let equipment stop you from trying things. I think you will find .. it doesn't really make that much difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubluefish2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bluefish2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/16/01 5:47:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3383.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: making money as a druid??</span><hr size=1> Well I've got 169 wisdom at lvl 54!! <br>

But I am the luckiest druid alive!!!! <br>
<br>
My big armors include Kromiff Military Leggings, which I met someone in NFP and he said he'd help me get them.<br>
<br>
Sarnak Battle Sheild, Yes at 44 I own this.. I was given it FREE by a guild mate after losing 4kpp.<br>
<br>
Coldain Boots/Gloves, got em for both for 6.5k... now how I got that money is a different story.<br>
<br>
I am currently 44 with 200 wisdom on the dot and wearing a sarnak battle sheild. At 29 I had 200 wisdom. Hehe not to shabby eh? =)<br>
<br>
Anyways at 34 my wisdom was 200.. But whenever I needed cash for whatever my wisdom would sink low.<br>
<br>
Your wisdom is fine for now =) <p><div align="center">
