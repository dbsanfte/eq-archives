There are so many stand out memories I could fill pages in the years that it has taken me to master my art. Thus said i will pick one choice memory and leave it at that...<br>
<br>
I had just reached my 20th season, and a ecpeted a proposal from a fine halfblood ranger to Tunare.  My family guild had planed a great wedding for us in the Greater Faydwer surounded by Tunares people, her lush forest canopies, and in the protective circle of an abandoned ring.  After a moving ceramony, we celibrated with much drink and cake.  I was much to busy to even think of food but did have my fill of strong drink.  But that was just the begining of the eve, for this celibration was coupled with an event of great magnatude.  We had prepaired games, trivia, drunken races and duels for the comunity to enjoy.  Many months were spent in preperations, we had gathered rare iteams as prizes, such as fine steel weaponry, a black tome with silver runes, and a great sum of platnum, 500+ plat if I recal correctly.  My role was to stand at the pod lifts and hand out the prizes and coin, as well as shout trivia and judge the story telling contest, buff and heal those in need...  There I stood, shakeing with excitment over my new marrage, laiden with bag after bag of precious thing and more coin than I had ever seen gathered in one place.  I had not eaten a single thing all day, and as the day drew on my stamina waverd and grew dim.  I soon found I could not move to save myself!  I was so laiden and hungry I could not even so much as regain manna to buff anyone who asked, and beyond that, everyone was so busy there was no one free to bring me food!  So I got crafty! I quickly shouted the first person to bring me muffins, or this foraged fruit or root and such forth would be rewarded..and thus a game provided me with enough strength to continue.  And that i would need plenty of! because as dusk fell we gathered around the same ruins as before and as a great bunch fell about in prayers and cries of praise for our Great Mother to bestow upon us, her chosen children a visit of blessing, for hours we called to her and in the end we were told the time was not right which was saddening, but did that stop us? Oh not the children of Tunare! we moved our party to the bars of Felwithe and cavorted the night away in song and dance and drink and tale...it was quite simply one of the best days in this druids life.<br>
<br>
&lt;ooc&gt;  the event we had planed was to end with a &quot;summoning&quot; of Tunare, which we had been weeks talking to GM's about to get a showing. We had a promiseif we gathered she would likely show, but a few days before on another server there was an event where tunare made a presence and everyone tried to kill her instead of play the event, andthey decided not to come to the even but didn't bother telling us until we were i the middle of &quot;praying&quot; for a visit =\ <p>51 seasons<br>

<br>
Heh, most memorable moment ever for me would be the day my friends and I dropped Faydedar.<br>
<br>
Anyone else remember sweating buckets in RL the day you found Dolgin up and your friends would actually come help?<br>
<br>
Wow, what a rush, and the funniest thing about that day was the 2 level 60 wizards that were running out to help me beat the fish died on the raptor islands passing by.  60 Wizards... dying to raptors.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd have to say the other &quot;signifigant&quot; event in my druid's career would be both the first time I ran through DL at level 18, and the first time I ran through WW to ToV.  (I didn't have a guide or nothing.  Just a map.)  I was sweating a cold sweat there.<br>
<br>
Far too many stories to tell I'm afraid.<br>

A level 55 paladin in my guild led me right through the middle of the zone. We're running along and he's saying &quot;and over there is the Giant fort, and those are Drolvargs, and oh..theres a Dragon...&quot;  I was terrified!  lol I got jumped by a Drachnid when we were almost through but luckily I made it to the zone. The first time I ported into Skyfire was another gutcheck. Oh, and I remember when I first got wolf form, I went straight to Unrest and explored the basement, what a thrill!<br>
<br>
Some of the best times of all though is when I get to help someone out of a helpless situation. We lose sight of it sometimes with all the math and comparisons and so forth, but we really are an amazing class. There's nothing like going to Kelethin and filling the zone with floating wolves (Lev, share wolfie), and I still am thankful for the ability to port all over the world in the blink of an eye. I still get a kick out of saying &quot;BRT&quot; to someone on the other side of Norath...<br>

We pushed our way all the way up to the 4th floor and were totally whiped out at the entrance.  Since the keys are not souldound, we had to fight our way to the top and camp all the keys again.  We tried for about 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Luckily, a call to arms rang out across the land, and a solid group of lvl 60's showed up.  Every one of them had thier epics and were decked out in the best possible gear for the time.  It was a sight to behold!  They fought all the way up to the 4th floor and rezzed my entire group, then evaced out before we could utter a thank you.<br>
<br>
It was the first time Ubers had ever been nice to me, much less took the time out of thier scheduale to help me.  Seeing all 6 of them with all that power was awsome.<br>
