You say (just because its an illegal substance), thats its okay for a cop to beat or physically abuse (thats illegal too!) the offender, who, from what I've heard didnt put up a fight or use force at all.<br>
<br>
You've contradicted yourself almost everytime you've posted here.  <br>
<br>
Physically hurting someone is against the law, whether it being a street fight, spanking a kid or using excessive force to arrest someone.<br>
<br>
So its alright to bruise and beat some kids that are prolly a 3rd of the size of the cop that didnt put up a fight?<br>
But its not okay to smoke some pot and have some fun with your friends?<br>
<br>
Both are illegal, so dont chose one side to defend and say the other ones bad.<br>
<br>
I dunno why you waste the effort to post here, you lack the ability to think before you speak, and offer no intelligence to what you say.<br>

<br>
On police brutality, its pretty bad ... my friend was drunk in a public park (yup, illegal), cop demanded he move instantly and my friend was really really drunk, and was having a hard time moving.  So the cop gets out his flashlight (big heavy ones) and hits him across the back of the head and says, &quot;I said move now!&quot;  He was handcuffed (had cuts on his wrists cuz they were on so hard) and dragged out of the park without really having a chance to move himself.<br>
<br>
It was me and a few friends there and we were threatened jail time too, even though we werent drunk and werent doing anything against the law. <p><br>

<br>
One cop versus two possible drug dealers<br>
<br>
He doesn't know what these guys might be high on nor what weapons they might have.<br>
<br>
He subdues one as quickly as possible with another in a bathroom stall. He can't see through the door to know where the guy is standing, if he has a weapon ready to attack him, nor if he is trying to flush evidence.<br>
<br>
Depending upon the &quot;mood&quot; of the area or state, he MIGHT be considered using excessive force. However in this policeman's eyes, his life could be at stake especially from the one he can't see behind the stall door.<br>
<br>
I am not agreeing with Warador however, just tossing out a different point of view. If we get to the point we are having public canings over a few joints, which seems Warador would support that, I am moving to Canada.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugeeldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geeldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 391<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/9/02 10:00:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16974.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kids...</span><hr size=1> I agree with Warador, basically. Kids nowadays have gone to hell. They have no respect for anyone, think they can do whatever they want, and it's just BS. I am sure the cop didn't do what wasn't necessary, just another story blown out of proportion.<br>
<br>
10 years ago, when I was in 8th grade, the worst thing you had to deal with was fighting. Now everywhere you look, some kid is selling pot, coke, shrooms, etc.<br>
<br>
As for the whole police brutality issue, well it's no secret that some cops overabuse their power, but sometimes it's needed. This reminds me of that show, Six Feet Under on HBO. The cop went to someones house and she complained that her husband/boyfriend was abusing her, and the cop entered the house, and wanted to take the guy to jail. He pushes the cop, tries to attack him, so the cop punches him and knocks him down. Then of course, he gets suspended. Where do you draw the line between legal and illegal, right and wrong? <br>
<br>
When I read articles in the paper about the police shooting someone, and then the family making a big deal about it, like it was unjustified, and suing the police or whatever, it just makes me sick. Granted, I am not in the position that the families are, I'd pry be pissed too if the cops killed a friend or family member of mine, but still. He/she had a gun and was pointing it at the officers head/chest, what are you supposed to do, ask them to put it down nicely? It's split second reaction time.<br>
<br>
There was a big story about something like this near me a few years back. Some girl (She was black) was shot by officers (they were white) because she wasn't responding to their commands, and wouldn't get out of the car. Oh yeah, she had a weapon on her too. She made a move to grab the weapon and she ended up getting shot like 17 times, but if you think about it, when 3 or 4 cops fire 3 or 4 rounds all at once, it's understandable. It's not like one cop unloaded his clip into her at point blank range. It was a big racial issue. I have black friends that agreed the cops were just protecting themselves. Ever since Rodney King, everything has gone to hell.<br>

<br>
&quot;10 years ago, when I was in 8th grade, the worst thing you had to deal with was fighting. Now everywhere you look, some kid is selling pot, coke, shrooms, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is so much wrong with that paragraph, I barely know where to start.... <br>
<br>
First off,  drugs aren't new. I guarantee that 10 years ago there were kids in the 8th grade with you that were using drugs and there were kids that were dealing drugs. I was in the 8th grade 25 years ago and there were kids using and dealing then, too. Everyone knew who they were and avoided or hung out with them depending on their feelings on the issue. <br>
<br>
Second, when you say that there are now kids dealing &quot;everywhere you look&quot;, what are you basing this statement on? Seriously, how much exposure do you have to the 8th graders of today? Can you honestly name one 8th grader you have recently seen dealing? <br>
<br>
Finally, what sort of warped value system sees drugs as a worse problem than violence? Honestly, who would you rather live next door to, a guy that attacks you physically from time to time or a guy that likes to light up a joint when he gets home from work? I mean, after all, if the the attacker lives next door, the worst thing you have to deal with is fighting, just like 10 years ago when you were in 8th grade.<br>
<br>
I am reminded of a few years back when Robby Alomar spit on an umpire. Yes, it was a bad thing to do. He was punished for it and he deserved to be punished for it. However, at the time I frequently heard people make the statement, &quot;spitting on him is worse than if he just punched him&quot;. <br>
<br>
Whenever I heard someone say that I offered them a simple deal: I'll let you spit in my face. Then I get to punch you. We can repeat the exchange as many times as you want. Funny thing, nobody ever took me up on that offer.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugeeldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Geeldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/9/02 11:34:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16974.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kids...</span><hr size=1> Giggs, you have misunderstood my post...<br>
<br>
I should have clarified that what I meant was I never had any friends that smoked, drank, dealt, etc in 8th grade, nor was there any of it in my school. When I was 13, I saw another 13 year old smoke, and I was shocked, it was the first time I had ever witnessed that by someone that young. Now I see it everywhere. By everywhere, I mean tv, newspaper, and sadly enough, my friends little brother. So yes, I have experienced it firsthand.<br>
<br>
Also, there is nothing wrong with smoking pot. I just used a generalization. My friends smoke pot. My friends dad comes home from work and lights a joint. I don't, but it doesn't mean I hate them or look down on them. They are adults, they can do as they please. It's the kids issue that makes me sick. Like I said, back then I was surprised at a 13 year old smoking a cigarette, nowadays 13 year olds do alot worse. <p>Geeldor Mooncaster<br>

<br>
By imposing prohibition, you automatically create the black market, so one could say that our so called 'drug problems' are a result of prohibition. <br>
<br>
Legalize drugs, control them, and handle them safely. Instead of wasting taxpayer money paying cops to beat up kids who want to smoke a joint, invest in some social programs that will help any users who develop an abuse problem (we could count alcoholics and nicotine addicts as well). Money for these programs could be gotten through the government-controled sale of these substances. If we are feeling brtual, then we can also just ignore the pathetic addicts.<br>
<br>
Legalize drugs and you kill the black market, organised crime will take a major hit, and suddenly those guns and bullets that were once funded by people buying pot from the neighborhood dealer will not be affordable.<br>
<br>
Not only is it restoring our freedom of chioce, but it might potentially be beneficial to the society in creating a new highly taxable product, freeing up prioson space taken up by dealers and users (not to mention the tax dollars saved in not holding these people, or prosecuting them), and dealing a serious blow to organised crime.<br>
<br>
If we were to just legalize weed, we woudl probably see tons of benefits. The number of addicts to other harder drugs would probably also decrease because the 'gateway' effect would be eliminated by selling your MJ at the local liquor store. By having to get ones potfrom a dealer who also carries @#%$ like speed and coke, it makes the harder drugs accessible.<br>
<br>
So the whole 'gateway effect' which has been so lamented is also a creation of prohibition. <br>
<br>
Prohibition benefits no one but organised crime; the war on drugs is a crock of 5hit, and a huge waste of money. Not only is it a waste of money, but it also robs us of our basic freedoms, and causes ignorance to enforce these policies.<br>
<br>
I understand that you backward americans don't even allow hemp products to enter your country because of your strict drug laws. Hemp contains less psychoactive chemicals (cannabinoids) than poppy seeds contain morphine. And by banning a product like hemp, we are also closing the door on growing it as a crop, which can be used to make many things: from fuel for your car, to paper, or tasty snacks.<br>
<br>
I think I am ranting a bit now, but oh well. <br>
<br>
The philosopher Kierkegaard talked about leading the inauthentic life. He pretty much said that if you let laws from external institutions govern what you see as being right and wrong, you are leading the inauthentic life. To lead the authentic life you must form your sense of right and wrong independantly of the rule of law, and in the process, you will probably break some laws. Just because the law says NO, dosen't mean it is wrong. If you accept the law without first asking yoruself if the laws are just, then you are not acting as a rational being.<br>
<br>
Warador, welcome to the inauthentic life. <p><hr align="center" width="60%" size="1">

That's a lemming destructive solution. Users probably say they should be legalized, dealers probably wouldn't want them legalized because they make a profit off its criminalization.<br>
<br>
It's a moral question. As in your previous argument you alluded to murder being in the same category as illegal drug use. Morally it's wrong to murder some one, this is an action that one human does to another. Drug use is something an individual does to him/her self.<br>
<br>
A law against murder is respectable it's morally self-evident. What an individual does to him/her self is his/her own business, some people tend to self-destruct others tend to self-preserve. And there are many individuals who are in between and function just fine despite laws against self-destruction. Obviously laws against drugs isn't respected due to the ability of large numbers of people who fuction in-between. Morally it isn't self-evident that drugs are an inherant evil, they are inanimate substances used and abused in various ways.<br>
<br>
In the 1930's you could send your child to the local drug store to buy heroin and while there were some abuse of this ability it wasn't wide spread. Many other drugs were available and easy over the counter which were handled in much the same way without widespread abuse. Whats changed?<br>
<br>
The mindset of the nation was changed with the ideal of social engineering, legislative monopolies, communist paranoia and a slide into socialisim where people believe that we can't take care of ourselves. We need a paternal/maternal government to spank our bottoms when we are bad.<br>
<br>
Instead of a society of accountable and responsible people, we have become dependant and irresponsible for our own actions. We are enabled by government programs to blame alcoholisim, drug use, racisim or being poor for being lazy, unsucsessful and unambitious. <br>
<br>
We've learned as a mob that it's easy to take from the producers and give to the looters by voting in mass for unprincipaled louts who make pretty father or mother images in our minds. People who we believe will smother us in compassion because it's not our fault, its the greedy and the rich who enslave us for their own benefit. <br>
<br>
Making drugs illegal in a country like the U.S. a country which as part of its culture encourages questioning authority. A country proud of its rugged individualisim history, a country which esposues concepts like FREEDOM, LIBERTY and the pursuit of happiness is STUPID.<br>
<br>
Drugs have been glorified and romanticized BECAUSE of the war on drugs. BECAUSE of the loss of liberty and freedom, BECAUSE we the people believe we can do what ever the fook we want as long as we don't hurt any one else. And DAMN the government who thinks it can ram subjective morals down our throats!<br>
<br>
Yeah drug abuse is terrible, it's a horrible waste of good people and good minds. The problem is we continue to feed its popularity as a rebellious issue rather than allow people to be accountable to themselves for stupid decisions.<br>
<br>
The politicization of marijuana is a prime example of this travesty. Kids can get pot easier than they can a pack of ciggarettes or a six pack of beer. And since this drug (marijuana) isn't as bad or evil as the authoritarian makes it out to be. They wonder ... hummm wonder what cocaine is like, or heroin, or LSD. And it's all available and easier access than beer and ciggarettes! Oh the drama! The glory (I'm like an adult) watch me get wasted!<br>
<br>
We write songs about it, make movies about it and a LOT of people function daily using lot's of illegal substances. This dosen't get past our kids, they see and know what's happening. <br>
<br>
Yes drug abuse is bad and America like an alcoholic is addicted and in denial that its a problem. The only way to solve the probem is to cut it loose, legalize it, make those who do it accountable for their own actions not allowing them to blame drug use as a reason for failure. Tough love, that's life .. we would be a healthier society if we did in the long view.<br>
<br>
So anyway we teach our kids to be rebellious, tell them no don't do that, and when they do and get slammed hard by a cop we say its justified. They learn to hide it better, they learn to lie better, they learn to disrespect legitimate law better. Heh go figure!<br>

Marijuana will not ever be legalized completely in our system, i think tobacco companies might lose a little money, and we all know that tobacco owns the lawmaking process in our country. (big bucks) follow that money ;p<br>
<br>
just an opinion i do think you all have a good thread going here, a lot of good rational posts ;p<br>
<br>
and the police brutality thing, i think almost every case of brutality involves someone that is sour over getting caught, blowing things outta proportion.  Im not saying police arent over brutal sometimes, but in their line of work, its their life and the responsibility for the lives of others they have to worry about.<br>

Honestly though, the problem of the strung out junky looking for his fix only exists when prohibition is in place.<br>

"I think most people realize alcohol isn't anywhere near as dangerous as illegal drugs or some prescription drugs for that matter."<br>
<br>
Pure fantasy. Most illegal drugs are not all that harmful if they are pure. And once again, if it wasn't unscrupulous criminals trying to increase profit by lacing their 5hit, and instead was the government-regulated buisness putting out clean, safe drugs, the danger associated with them would drop off considerably (that is not to say that it would be a good idea to consume drugs too much in any instance... nothing in excess). <p><hr align="center" width="60%" size="1">
