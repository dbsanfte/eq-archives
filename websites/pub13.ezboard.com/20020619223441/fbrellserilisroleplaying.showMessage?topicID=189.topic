<br>
The Eternal Flame, gushing from the white marble alter in flowers of orange and yellow, stood its vigil in the Halls of Remembrance, a colorful reminder to all who entered that they tread on ground both holy in its nature and profound in the sacrifices of those who graced the tombs within. Nostramis entered, and bowed toward the Flame whose origins lay lost in the time of the Combine, and quietly said, “To the Guardians remembered, I renew my vow.” Adding a humble bow, he turned and followed the honor guard down the stairs to the left of the flame and toward the tombs of House Ecthalion.<br>
<br>
Despite the presence of the flame, the stoneworks of the mausoleum, graced by bas relief images of the great wood and other images of the world they had fought to preserve, added a silent chill to the air. The Halls of Remembrance were a place of rest, a place of peace, and a place of memory. In ancient times, strong magiks had been embroidered into the stoneworks in an invisible weave, manifesting protection for the dead that could not be offered to the living. Legends said that none save the Feir Dal themselves, and even then none that had no relations within the Halls, could pass the first wardstone. Whether this was truth or legend, Nostramis walked in awed silence as he passed the crypts of the Guardians that had defended the Light in Faydwer for millennia.<br>
<br>
The Halls stretched for miles beneath the city, extending into the mountains that encompassed the Feir Dal bastion. The crypts of House Ecthalion were near the beginning on the east side, as the House traced its line in succession among the Guardians to their formation after the fall of the Combine. Nostramis own father lay here, as did his grandfathers back into ages long forgotten. He knew all their names, just as he knew that one day, perhaps, his own descendents would know his. One day he would join his cousin in a marble crypt, and be added to the memory of the Guardians.<br>
<br>
His guide, Guardian Tyrren Celthoron, turned to the left, passing through the Arch of Ecthalion. The arch itself was hewn from a slab of blue-gray granite and was intricately carved with the images of their patron lord, Karana. Nostramis bowed again, offering a silent prayer to Karana, then followed Celthoron down the paths of his family line.<br>
<br>
After nearly a quarter mile, Celthoron turned left once more, leading to circular, domed chamber. The lanterns flared to white life as they entered, illuminating four crypts. Nostramis bowed before the tomb of his own father, Celemnos Ecthalion. Beside his crypt was an identical sepulcher, made at the same time, but lying empty. Here, whenever the remains could be found, would be placed the body of his uncle, Celebrindor Ecthalion who had long since disappeared while on duty patrolling the mountains of Crushbone. Next to the empty tomb was the last resting place of Celestramis Ecthalion, and beside it the empty crypt that would one day be filled with Nostramis’ own remains.<br>
<br>
Celetramis’ sepulcher was carved with the images of his life, a life spent in pursuit of his father’s death, a son searching for answers and finding only death at the hands of an assassin. Nostramis choked back his rage at his cousin’s murder, and tried to remember that he had at least brought one of the murderers to trial. If there were more, he would find them and they too would taste the hangman’s noose. Nostramis had no more tears to shed, so he bowed once more, to the memory of his cousin, and turned to Celthoron with a nod.<br>
<br>
The honor guard nodded in return and said quietly, “It is odd to see so many people concerned with the sanctity of one Guardian’s remains, when so many in the Halls seem forgotten.”<br>
<br>
Nostramis tasted a sudden acrid twinge as he turned toward the guard, and feeling suddenly ill he said, “What do you mean, so many concerned?”<br>
<br>
Celthoron stopped at the clamps to the sepulcher’s lid, and turned toward Nostramis. “Well, just three days past, a herald from the Guardian General came to inspect the remains on orders from the command. It seems they had just received your message of some threat by the dark ones to obtain them and use them to foul purpose.”<br>
<br>
As a Knight and a Commander in times of war and peace, Nostramis had learned to rely upon cold logic to lead him through times of high emotion, and he paused long enough to calculate the time it would have taken for his message to reach the Guardian General from Kunark. At best speed, the Antonican Bards could not have beat him here by more than a day. Cursing himself for not stopping to speak with the General before descending to the tombs, Nostramis waved for Celthoron to proceed. The peace of the halls of Remembrance was shattered the instant the lid swung partially open. Celthoron let go of the lid as if it burned his hands. His face turned ashen, and he spun toward Nostramis with agony in his eyes. Nostramis had known the instant that Celthoron had informed him of the others that the remains of his cousin were gone.<br>
<br>
“I…Commander Ecthalion, I cannot explain…” Celthoron muttered.<br>
<br>
Nostramis waved his hand once and quietly cut him off. The guard stood shaking, realizing that under his watch, in the first time since the crafting of the Halls, a tomb had been violated. Walking to the side of the crypt, a cold, hardened anger lit within his heart and soul like the Eternal Flame itself, Nostramis looked within. There was no body, but instead there were two items. One, was a scroll sealed with white wax, imprinted with the emblem of an eagle in flight. The second was a dragoon’s dirk, the blade of which was stained with old blood. Nostramis reached within and picked up both items, then turned to Celthoron.<br>
<br>
“What did the other visitor look like? You must remember, what race, what face, what name did he give?” Even as he asked the question, Nostramis knew he would gain no answer. The lid to the sepulcher must have been trapped with a contact poison, for the guard had stepped back, and leaned against Nostramis’ own tomb. Looking at his hands once, he sagged to his knees, sweat beading across his face as he struggled for life. Nostramis moved forward, but the guard shook his head. With an heroic effort, he waved Nostramis back and choked out his last words. “I am poisoned for my crimes, Guardian, throw not yourself away on me. I have failed…. I have failed….” Then he fell to the side and lay upon the smooth flagging of the floor. <br>
Nostramis stood for several moments, then slowly slid the dirk between under his belt. Then, he opened the scroll and read the words, written in Teir Dal.<br>
<br>
“As you can see, we could have easily slain you with the same substance. We chose not to. Bring the Bloodstone Chalice to us, return to us what is ours, or we will raise Celestramis and send him to fetch it from you. The Harvest has begun.” The note was not signed, but rather was artfully illuminated with the symbol of a white eagle in flight.<br>
<br>
Nostramis tucked the scroll away, then knelt beside Celthoron. “You too shall be avenged, Guardian, and your death shall not be forgotten. Standing, he saluted once, then turned and strode down the hallways, passing eventually back to the city proper. After making his report to his mother and the General, Nostramis bid them all to take the signs to heart, and to double the guard. The darkness was alive, and was creeping even into the most hallowed of places. All decency had been violated, and with it, any claim they had to decency in their treatment. Vowing that he would not return until the White Raptor had met justice, Nostramis cast the runes about him and faded away in a shimmering light. Moments later, like a shadow of vengeance, he entered the hall of the Knights Templar, and raised the alarm to his brethren.<br>
