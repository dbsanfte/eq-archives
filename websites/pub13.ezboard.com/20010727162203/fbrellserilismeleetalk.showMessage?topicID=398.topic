I do not think a ranger should ever get the defense skill level of a warrior, paly or sk; i view defense as the measure of a charaters constitution (hit points) in combination with their gear (AC) in the ability to absorb blows.  Although i have always been baffled by the fact that a warrior can dodge and parry blows as well as a ranger, and anyone that has ever felt the weight of a suit of field plate versus chain mail should understand why.  At least that was until i realized that logic is not an logical argument in the face of the Vision.  But that is a point of semantics, one which does not make a huge difference in the end.  The way i have always kinda viewed a ranger is as a quick, agile person that does decent damage from afar, weakening an opponent before closing in to finish in hand to hand; or with the right support, a character that provides a valuable and versatile role in a group.<br>
<br>
Rangers do die a lot, anyone that has been with me on a fear raid knows that Cazic and i are on a first name basis, and on large raids, as often as not, when the target &quot;boss&quot; mob is killed people look around in disbelief if there are rangers left standing.  Dieing is part of the class, if you are uncomfortable with that then you should switch to another.  Rangers do not, nor should they have the damage absorption ability of warriors or other hybrids; and i would be sorely dissappointed if the ranger class were beefed up to a comparable level of the true tanks.  People would be better off thinking of a ranger as a corn fed druid that dropped out of school and started carrying a sword; stop thinking that a ranger should be a warrior that can cast SoW and snare.    <br>
<br>
There is a couple of mis-statements in a few posts i have read, rangers CAN solo, i do it when i don't have much time to play, or can't find a group.  Many people have seen me solo the first few mobs at the zone in sebilis, which i was able to do starting at about level 56.  Rangers can act as the tank in a good group, i have been the solo tank in the chef/disco/guardian and crypt areas of sebilis, as well as in skyfire, skyshrine, chardok and howling stones.  Granted the cleric didn't have a vast reserve of mana, but that is to be expected.  And it is not because i have awesome gear, i don't have my epics, and the haste item i currently employ is a belt of the pines (15% haste).<br>
<br>
As far as offense, personally i don't give a whit if they give rangers a higher cap to offense.  Self bufffed and in wolf form i think Stamen's offense is in the low 1100's.  Is another 50 or 100 points max going to make that much of a difference?  I have a difficult time believing so.  I would like to see some more improvements to the archery skill though, which as i see it is the defining characteristic of a ranger.  Perhaps add the slight possibility of a disabling blow (in excess of 500 dmg with a high damage bow) starting when the skill is over 200.  I would even go so far as to say a warrior's archery skill should have been capped at 100.  they are masters of all weapons true, but that does not mean they should be prodigies at them all.  besides, can you imagine firing a bow in a suit of full plate?<br>
<br>
If Verant wants to make rangers more interesting and fit them bettter into a specific niche in the game then  Verant needs to stop tweaking the skills that all melee have in common and begin to focus on the ones that set the ranger class apart from the others.  One thing i think would be an interesting addition is if rangers were given a once per hour skill like the other hybrids abilities of lay hands and harm touch.  Perhaps befriend an animal to fight once per hour, or maybe a call out to the goddess to strike an opponent for direct damage of an amount based on level (say 1500dd at level 60).  Something that only belongs to the ranger class, a skill new and different than that of the parent class the ranger is a bastard of.<br>
<br>
Overall i think rangers are good where they are, and although there are a few little things i would like to see, i would not make any wide sweeping changes to the class, only a some minor additions that set the class apart, but not anything that vastly alters what a ranger is now.<br>
<br>
I suppose in closing rangers should stop wishing they were warriors, stop bemoaning and coveting the defense and ac of the &quot;true tank&quot;.  Realize what rangers really are, a highly dynamic and interesting class, valuable in a group, and able to do things for themselves. <br>

People need to group with rangers before saying they aren't a good class. <p>Wodar Bladefury<br>
