<br>
Man..what fun i've had the last few days. I've had IDSL (slow) for about a year...when my contract expired...I jumped over to cable!  So they come over and install it on Saturday....being the addict..I log on to EQ right away...everything seemed to work.  Although the lag problems suck now....i'd go almost LD (right bar empty, left bar almost all gone), thend come back only to be lagged for a longer period of time  *sigh*<br>
<br>
Anyways....I couldnt access about 80% of the websites....i'd get the &quot;this page cannot be displayed msg.&quot;  ESPN.com , USBANK.com , PACBELL.com/DSL ( was pissed ), the chat help at att.  Pretty lame right.  So here's a recap of my experience with tech support: <br>
<br>
-before I get to speak to a lvl 2 tech..i'm put in the lvl 1 que for a LONG time..then elevated..and wait again..no freaking direct line! Can I get a direct number to lvl 2-sorry we cant do that!<br>
<br>
Sunday<br>
<br>
6pm-8pm  Talked with LVL 1 tech's...who made me do all sorts of stupid stuff!<br>
8pm - 1am elevated to LVL 2<br>
first tech...put me on hold for 40 mins, I hung up, called back<br>
2nd tech...while explaining to her..it worked again..for like 10 mins<br>
3rd tech...disconnected me<br>
4th tech...forgot what he had me do...was too tired<br>
<br>
Monday<br>
6am-11am<br>
first tech...said your registry is fuxxored...called Microsoft<br>
 *called MSFT, reffered me to DELL - WTF!<br>
2nd and third tech... more crap ( your network is causing conflicts - yank network, your firewall is causing probs - turn off, oh..if you turn off..some settings still there, programs causing conflicts- So I just format c<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &amp; reinstalled)<br>
4th tech... NOW this is were I got pissed....guy couldnt pull up my ticket..so he didnt have all the info I had.  Off the bat..he was giving me attitude! Made like it was my fault. @home only gives you a connection...we cant guarantee what sites you can visit. And his tone..OMFG..after all the @#%$ i've been thru!<br>
<br>
-Called Customer Service to cancel (hehhe...after 2 days). I couldnt even talk..I was fuming.... the CS guy gave me a free month..and has a tech coming out here to FIX it....says no tech should have that attitude with me...NO F'ING @#%$!<br>
<br>
-So today ... I decide to use dial up, figure...if I can get to my sites...then its not my computer...its @home right.  Dial in....what do you know sites work!  Restart my machine...Cable works!  =)  So now when the techs drive out here...oh..I just fixed it..now you can F-OFF..thx!<br>

I tried them and compared them to DSL...DSL is slower but much more reliable. I am thinking of bumping up the speed on my DSL to the next level but even at its lowest level I have lost my DSL once in the year or so I I have been running it.<br>
<br>
DSL had a bumpy start with me but once I got the phone guys to clear up probs on their end and the DSL guys to clear up probs on their end it has been flawless since.<br>

I was to the point of looking at DSL instead, but found they were having even worse outages, so I didn't switch. It's worked well - with just a cuople brief outages for several months now, and I get fine performance.<br>
<br>
They usually call to check on the guy coming out - if you don't think there's any problem now, cancel him, don't punish the company that way, it'll ony raise everyone's bill.<br>
<br>
I had them out a couple times though and they found what they said were way off line settings for some reason... <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

<br>
Ive had them for two years now and every single time Ive had a tech/billing/service issue their absolute LACK of customer service astounds me.  I am by and large computer illiterate but I swear to god Im above their level 1 techs....its scary.<br>
<br>
In the time Ive had them Ive had to endure unexplained outages for hours even days at a time...with no response from them.  Every time I talk to their customer service I get the feeling that they couldnt give a rats ass if I was a customer or not<br>
<br>
Unfortunately their my only choice atm for broad band and Im stuck.....but as I type this Qwest trucks are down the street dropping in infrastructure.  So in 30-60 days /wave @home<br>
and hello Qwest DSL.  I think Ill do a small jig the last time I have to send that company money. <br>

LONG recap!</span><hr size=1> I have to agree that DSL is overall better than @home crap. I even think my pos dial up is better! I mean think about it.. I never download anything and I rarely go LD (like 1 a month, if that, it will be my ISP) unless its on Verants end..I do get some lag when it's busy but not an unplayable amount.<br>
<br>
One night (just for comparision) things went like this.. I log in about 5:30pm ish  by the time I log out at midnight no LD's and I lagged out just 2 times even then just for a second.<br>
<br>
My BF with @home LD'd 5 times in 3 hours before giving up. He could not hold his connection for more than 15 mins before loosing it. He's a software engineer by trade so he was doing quite a bit of his own trouble shooting.<br>
<br>
Things are not always this bad for him but my junky dial up comes no where near his @home for connection probs. <br>
<br>
Downside to this for me is he can download something in 5 mins takes me like 3 hours, doesn't matter much to me all I wanted was to play Eq. <br>
<br>
If you go DSL do NOT go Earthlink DSL!!! It's more of a dial up than DSL it's a waste of time and money and poor connection my exp with Earthlink is about identical to yours with @home. When I had Earthlink DSL I had to Dial up all the time to connect, my connection would go stale (after 2 hours I could not pull up web pages), and it would go out of service at very bad times (usually my play hours=P) anyways enough bad mouthing Earthlink.<br>
<br>

I can speak from person experience... @home is not owned by Verant - lol... I just got hired on two weeks ago as a CSR for @home (aka Tier 1 tech). They just hired a lot of new people for CSR, unfortunately, some of the people there do nothing, as with every help desk. The monotone attitude guy sounds like my old roommate or this guy I was connected with the other day to listen in on his call. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sorry about your troubles though, sounds like you got some shady peeps there that didn't get the proper training offhand, and the 2nd tier tech support should have had referred you back down to a tier 1 tech so we could roll a truck out to you for on site support. Intermitent connections are usually due to wrong computer (DNS) names or bad settings in TCP\IP or the modem needs refreshing (unplugging while comp is on from wall and comp, shutting down comp, plugging it back in, starting comp aka power cycle). If that doesn't solve it and they can't figure out wtf is going on then they should have sent onsite tech support to you. Personally, the 2nd tier guy sounded like he didn't know wtf he was doing so gave you another one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukrozarvorlagen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krozar Vorlagen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/31/01 6:05:06 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Irony</span><hr size=1> I have @home and in the year I have had it, I have had 0 problems. <br>

Unfortunately, as with anywhere in RL, there are some people who hate their job and still sit at that desk. Most of your connection problems aren't the fault of ATT or my company, but the fault of the local service provider. Everything pretty much occurs on their end, outages, intermittent connections, moronic techs, etc... Granted ATT takes the blame for this because they are in the lead of it all. Well, would type more, but I have to go in eventually. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uerylflynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eryl Flynn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.bloodcircle.com/images/bcicon.jpg height=22 width=22 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/01 7:18:36 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.bloodcircle.com/images/bcicon.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: @home - wonder if its owned by VERANT! LONG recap!</span><hr size=1> Bond, the issues with the provider are still AT&Ts problem.  When you buy cable modem service you get the connection and ISP together unlike DSL where that is seperate but some times comes packaged.<br>
<br>
If the provider AT&T chose as a vendor is not doing their job, ditch them and find a new better one.  You are responsible for the choices you make.  Do not try to pull a Qwest move and point the trouble else where that is what caused Otara alot of trouble. <p><br>

LONG recap!</span><hr size=1> I've had @home for almost 2 years now and I only had a problem with it after the first couple of months. For some reason they kept having outages at 12:00am EST and I would lose my connection for around a half hour.<br>
<br>
This lasted a month and ever since I have had 0 problems. I guess with anything results may vary. I'm happy I get 315k per second transfers on some sites I download from.<br>
