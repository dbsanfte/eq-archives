<br>
I need the following 6 pieces to complete my epic.  For reasons that are not important here, I can't schedule guild raids to complete it, so I'm looking for what I need to do to get it done pretty much myself.<br>
<br>
I can get the following myself if I have to, so they shoudn't be too tough:<br>
<br>
Corrupt Brownie (get necro friend to fear it and it's cake)<br>
Jade Reaver (camp EC offering my soul and every scrap of plat I can muster until I see one for sale if nothing else)<br>
<br>
Here are the pieces I need help with:<br>
Uluump<br>
Faydedar<br>
Venril Sathir's Remains<br>
Corrupt Seahorse<br>
<br>
I've seen other posts where people say they can kill these mobs pretty much with 1-2 groups.  Ok, what would be the makeup of these groups?<br>
<br>
What minimum force would be required to be able to pull this off?  I don't have access to an uber guild with tons of level 60s in full Skyshrine armor and Sleepers/VP gear, etc.  I do have a few friends who are close to 60 that are decently outfitted that I could ask for help.<br>
<br>
So, what would be a reasonable force of 55-60s that could expect to take out these mobs?<br>
<br>
The only one I've ever fought was Faydedar and we used 4 groups (it was massive overkill).<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help, and let the discussion begin :)<br>

<br>
I used 15 people to kill him, ave level was 52 appox.  Neat fight, no deaths, but we were heavy on casters (becuase they wanted to help).  Ideally, this can be done with 1 or 2 groups, tank heavy, 3-4 tanks per, 55 MA recommanded, Defesnive Disc, 2 clr healing.<br>
<br>
Faydedar:<br>
<br>
2-4 Groups.  I killed him for mine with 24 People, no deaths and some had low resists.  Secret to winning is to not have him move.  Once he starts to ping pong, you'll probly end up on CR. <br>
<br>
Venril Sathir's Remains:<br>
<br>
I've killed him a few times, once with no chanter, 2 lvl 55 clerics and a lvl 49 MA =/  We always took a min of 2 groups, but I'm fairly sure a high end group could do this solo.  he does a single target Lifetap.  Keeping him focused on one person will make this a short fight.<br>
<br>
Corrupt Seahorse:<br>
<br>
YAY! Kedge, used two groups to kill him, but it was a guild raid (got several horses for various people).  I would think this was doable with 1 group.  Corrupt is a lvl 53 Summoning mob which likes to CH it's self.  The tainted PH is a lvl 51 Clr mob. Pick a cave where the Materiach (sp) Spawns, and only have to deal with one mob every 18ish min, and no wanderers.  You can then pull the rest of the caves to speed up the spawning on the tainted.<br>
<br>
I will make myself avaible to you, and as previosuly Mentioned Cienya is willing to help as well.  Let us know.<br>

Personally i had five ppl-warrior, rogue, wizard, cleric and druid-all 52 to 55.  get some timely stuns in and its not that bad.  worst part about this is getting it to spawn sometimes.<br>
<br>
Ulump:<br>
I had two groups i believe.  Really need all melee and healers, with a wizard with lure perhaps.  Just beat him down.<br>
<br>
Brownie:<br>
Like you said, fear him and its simple.  I had four people.  Wizard, Cleric, Druid (all 52 to 55) and enchanter (42ish).  enchanter mezzed corrupted.  we medded up and took him out.<br>
<br>
Faydedar:<br>
I had 18 ppl-was all i could muster up the second time around.  First time, the trigger was...uhh...killed by an SK that it attacked.  So just be careful of that.  I had three or four high 50's paladins that tanked, two or three clerics, and an assortment of people.  Just make sure to have high resists and highest levels possible.<br>
<br>
Venril Sathir's Remains:<br>
I hear one group can take him but i have no personal knowledge yet.  I got my druid stone from the original VS through the help of a kind guild that didnt need any more stones.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for that darn jade reaver:<br>
dont get your hopes up on buying it unless you have ALOT of cash or a very friendly guild that will sell it to you:  saw one for sale in NFP the other day and the guy wanted 30K for it.  I said i wouldnt pay that much and asked him what the highest bid was.   highest bid was 25K and there were people still wanting it.  not sure on what he exactly sold it for  *sigh*<br>
<br>
only thing i would say that a guild is needed for nowadays is Fay.  other than that, one good group can knock out most of the stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugreggorumbletum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>greggo rumbletum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/22/02 9:43:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5169.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mustering forces...</span><hr size=1> Seahorse is easy for one group, low 50s.<br>

Did Ulump with 5 people, only 3 of whom were actually needed (60 war, 59 bard and 54 cleric).<br>
<br>
Brownie 2-3 people would be safe.<br>
<br>
Did Faydedar with 12 people but they were pretty high level; key is your main tank.<br>
<br>
Most people really like CoM raids and there are epic mobs for shaman and mage so it shouldn't be too hard to pull something together.  You need a high level rogue so make friends with one now (unless you want to try the AoE pull technique which will certainly get the reavers out from behind the door!!!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umylene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mylene</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.columbus.rr.com/miri311/KR3_04.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/22/02 10:09:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5169.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.columbus.rr.com/miri311/JEANFACE2.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mustering forces...</span><hr size=1> My personal experience:<br>
<br>
Kedge Seahorse: did this awhile back when I level 58. Just me and a level 60 shaman duo. An old level 55 mage friend did show up towards the end of the camp right when the Corrupted spawned, made it easier.<br>
<br>
Camped the Matriarch/Undertow area. Took about 1.5 hrs.<br>
<br>
Brownie: duo'ed with a level 58 'chanter. I was 58 as well.<br>
<br>
Got VS stone before VSR changes so not applicable.<br>
<br>
Fay was about 24 people on a Saturday afternoon shortly after his change to a triggered spawn. Standard Naggy type kill. Once again, I was level 58.<br>
<br>
Hmm...Ulump. I think I had 1 cleric, a 'chanter, a warrior my level (yet again, 58), a rogue and ranger. I think this was a &quot;hey lets goto Seb and hunt...oh want to stop in Swamp of No Hope real quick?&quot; kind of deal.<br>

I was 57, and gained 4 blue while doing it.  It's a hard camp to work alone.  <br>
Eventually I ran into some nice people who helped, and we had a Mage, Ranger, 2 Druids, and a Shaman.  We nailed him twice in just over an hour, by clearing everything around the Undertow/Seahorse Caves area.  Both Druids happy :)<br>
<br>
Ulump we did with 7 people.  2 Rangers, Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Monk and Druid.  All 57+ .  He aggroes from a long way off, and caught us by surprise.  We recovered and kicked his butt.  Not too tough.  <br>
<br>
Faydedar:  22 people, all high level.  We owned him completely.  I think 2 high lvl groups can do it.  Make sure your resists are high.<br>
<br>
The Brownie was cake.  Myself and a 59 Ranger tore him up.<br>
He's up regularly anyway, just zone in and track occasionally.<br>
<br>
With all the grouped fights, you should have a strong tank.  He needs to hold aggro completely.  If the healer looks after him, you win.  Simple as that.<br>

<br>
I did Ump recently.<br>
<br>
Some Notes:<br>
<br>
A 57 Shaman was able to get a slow on him.  It might have been that new Luclin Disease based slow, but it worked.<br>
<br>
The Ranger proc spell that does like 150?  Hit Ump for full.<br>
<br>
To help keep Ump on the MA, have every healer there cast 1 small heal when the MA gets to 60%.  Then the Cleric can safely Cheal and not draw aggro.<br>
<br>
Ump hit for 200-250, no kick, Bash for around 50.  I would say he had less then the listed 30,000hp, but can't say for certain.<br>
<br>
Respawn is 12 hours <p><table width="85%" border="0">

The hardest part about Fay isnt the melee or AoE.  Its lag.  Do whatever you have to, have the chanters log after they buff, but keep it under 24 people, or the lag becomes a major issue.  Depending on your MA, you may need 2-3 clerics.<br>
<br>
I did mine with 2 clerics, 58 and 60, a level 60 warrior, and a gaggle of rogues with epics.  Fight lastest about 45 seconds, mainly due to rogues having a tremendous damage output.  Its all about doing damage fast, before the AoE eats away your groups and your clerics go OOM.  Rogues are the way to go, imo.  I think the lowest level rogue (53) parsed the log of the fight and came up with 2k as his damage during the fight, so with 7 rogues there, you can see how they would be doing most of the damage.  <p>Mullen Skywatcher<br>

One group of 6. We where<br>

&quot;Honestly the entire epic can be done by one good group.<br>
<br>
Cleric Druid Enchanter Rogue Warrior Monk<br>
imo<br>
<br>
But they'd all have to be 60 and for Faydedar they'd have to be REALLY well equipped.&quot;<br>
----<br>
<br>
Tried Faydedar with 3 people 2 boxing just to see if it was doable.<br>
Ranger 60 (also playing 52 cleric)<br>
Ranger 60 (also playing 54 druid)<br>
Monk 60 (also playing 54 chanter)<br>
<br>
Had Faydedar at one pixel health when the last character died. Came back later and added a level 60 warrior and Fay died to us with mana to spare. The challange of doing hard'ish things with minimum amount of people is a rush. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukinare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kinare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/8/02 5:38:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5169.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: -</span><hr size=1> /agree Ianadin<br>

56 rog<br>
60 warr<br>
56 dru<br>
<br>
This is the worst group I did this with, and the rogue had horrible resistances. Cleric and druid were oom at the end of the fight, so each person there was essential. If the rogue had better resistances I bet the druid wouldn't have gone OOM (as a cleric, I am not responsible for the death of someone with crappy resistances).<br>
<br>
Biggest thing is to have good resistances and AE heal with Herioc Bond (for the cleric obviously). HB also has a longer range than group heal spells.<br>
<br>
Herioc Bond = 400 hp / 420 mana = about .95 hp/mana ratio<br>
<br>
Word of Vigor = 620 hp / 750 mana = .83 hp/mana ratio<br>
<br>
Also, not everyone is going to be down by 620 hp every time you cast word of vigor. <p><center>
