Faydark was quiet today, as the expected hero trudged onwards to her home, and only the two standing guards were there to greet her.<br>
&quot;Greetings, Silvermoon. It has been quite some time since I have been blessed with seeing my home.&quot; she spoke audibly, removing her helmet and bending her knees quickly in a show of respect to the watch.<br>
&quot;That it has, Fenye. Your arrival has been expected, the bards brought news of your return as soon as it was heard you left Kunark. We await you inside, if you will.&quot; He spoke in a solemn tone, typical of a guard who has been standing his post for a full shift, but Silvermoon was one of the strongest of the Felwithe Watch. He took his steadfast attitude with pride, and all who knew him understood why he never was excited nor saddened. A perfect guardsman.<br>
&quot;Thank you, I'm quite tired, but I would like to see those I left behind so long ago. I'll head inside immediatly with your permission to pass.&quot; A nod of approval and she was on her way inside, passing through the decorative tunnel and into the main portion of Felwithe.<br>
The city was just as she remembered it. Marble white columns rose up the flanks of the bridge entrance, revealing a walkway made of pure granite high above the bridge itself. Many guards walked above, holding themselves proudly as they surveyed the city that was thiers. The sky was as blue as ever, and the crystal clear river below had tiny fish swimming beneath the reflections of the city.<br>
A sharp intake of breath let her lungs feel at ease. No more foul stenches of dungeons, no more odors of blood, and there was no smell of sweat and rank breath. This was Felwithe, city of the High Elves, and home to Fenye.<br>
A formidable figure stepped out of the guildhall and approached her. He was tall, well muscled but walked with the elegance of a true elf. His sword was slung loose in it's scabbard, and his shield strapped across his back. It was impossible to discern his face from the brilliant shine to his silver armor, but when he spoke, Fenye knew immediately who it was.<br>
&quot;Hello, Jyleel,&quot; she said with a kneel of respect. &quot;It's been far too long since I have seen your face, I almost forgot who it was who taught me the principles of Tunare.&quot;<br>
His face came into view, but it was not a face of warm welcomes. He was stern, cold eyes staring deep into Fenye. <br>
&quot;There is a matter to attend to first, if you will follow me please.&quot;<br>
This is odd, she thought, How could someone I've known my entire life be so cold towards me?<br>
At that moment she felt the push of several guards behind her, urging her to head towards the Paladin guild. She followed Jyleel with no resistance, but the way things were going on set her at a great unease.<br>
<br>
Inside were just about every known adventurer and noblemen and women, all seated in a fashion that indicated she was to stand before them all. Jyleel walked to the center of them all, and then took his stance behind an oak podium.<br>
Clearing his throaght, he began,&quot;Many of you know who now stands before you. Fenye of Felwithe. Many of you have seen her grow as a paladin of Tunare, and all of you has seen her evolve into what she is today,&quot; his voice boomed across the room.<br>
&quot;A herertic.&quot;<br>
&quot;What?! What is the meaning of this foolishness, Jyleel! I've done nothing wrong!&quot;<br>
&quot;Silence! You have forsaken the rights of the Paladin! You have cast away your faith towards the Mother! You are here to be found guilty of Heresy and charged for your crimes!&quot; He shouted at the stricken paladin.<br>
&quot;As a paladin of the Koada'Vie-&quot; she was cut off by Jyleel's corrective voice.<br>
&quot;Former.&quot;<br>
&quot;.. as a faithful servant to the Mother, the city, and the cause, I have traveled across the entire known world. I have led charges against the Crushbone orcs long before my other classmates have. I was successful in killing Mayong Mistmoore's chosen knight. I have faced and won victories against the dreaded dragons, Nagafen and Vox, and I have been to the lands of Kunark, where I have slain the evil dragon, Trakanon. I have also been to the frozen lands of Velious, and I have made allies with many powerful creatures there. I have even gone into the fabled Plane of Growth and met the Mother herself, where I won favor with her and was given the sword I have now.&quot;<br>
&quot;You were seen with the hated dark elves. You have been seen in company with ogres, trolls and even the vile Iksar. You have befriended them as well. You are no paladin, you are a spy,&quot; Jyleel accused.<br>
&quot;Lies! The dark elves are not what you think! They show no faith to Innoruuk! I have been with them when we have gone into his own Plane and defeated him! I couldn't have done so without thier aid. The dark elves do not hate everything, like you fools assume. So yes, I have befriended the Tier'Dal.&quot;<br>
Gasps of horror echoed throughout the audience, followed by a scowl that slowly stretched its way across Jyleel's face.<br>
&quot;Then it is confirmed, you have befriended the enemy, and chosen your side. Guards, remove her weapons and take her to a holding cell. Prepare the gallows, she hangs tomorrow before sunrise.&quot;<br>
Tears ran down her face as she couldn't believe what had just transpired. Her friends, loved ones, and people who she had known since she began the life of an adventurer had turned on her, and condemned her to death. Fine, she thought, if they want to betray me, then there is a price to pay for it. With that thought, she drew her sword.<br>
&quot;This is the sword the Mother gave to me,&quot; she spoke in her most serious tone.<br>
&quot;It is the sword of Firiona Vie! She must have killed her to get that weapon! The Mother would never allow someone like her to attain that!&quot; someone shouted anonymously.<br>
&quot;And as a Koada'Vie, I have the right to challenge any who accuse me of Heresy. It is written in the law.&quot;<br>
Silence berieved the crowd momentarily, who awaited Jyleel's answer to her statement.<br>
&quot;Very well, Fenye. Take your rest, I accept your challenge to one on one combat tomorrow at sunrise. Guards, remove her from this Hall, and make sure she remains in a secure hold until the morn.&quot;<br>
Sheathing the blade, she walked willfully to her destination. The nervous guards kept a distance behind Fenye, and sighed a sigh of relief as she entered her jail without further incident.<br>
<br>
*    *     *<br>
<br>
A cloaked man crept his way through the long shadows of night. His years of training allowed him to walk amongst the rubble and not make a single sound, not even the sharp intake of breath when something pierced the skin of his lightly clothed feet.<br>
Easily picking the lock to her cell, he entered to see Fenye sitting slumped on the only cot.<br>
&quot;You're late.&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm surprised you are still alive. I would have thought that after Jyleel was done with you, I'd come home to see a corpse stinking up the air above me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't be so morbid,&quot; she said in a hushed voice, carful not to alert the guardsmen. &quot;I haven't much time, so hear me out.&quot;<br>
He nodded silently and listened.<br>
&quot;Someone framed me. I don't know who it is, but I intend to see them join me in the afterlife.&quot;<br>
&quot;But you'll defeat Jyleel in battle tomorrow. You have a good chance of beating that old geezer.&quot;<br>
&quot;Even if I win, I will still die. Do you think the people of Felwithe will let me leave after killing thier General? I'm dead either way, so this is where you come in.&quot;<br>
&quot;Go on then.&quot;<br>
&quot;Whoever it was, hates me. But I'm not going to die alone. Take this, and you should know what to do with it,&quot; she said as she unlocked a tiny compartment in her breastplate and handed him a vial of red fluid.<br>
&quot;By the gods, where did you get this?&quot;<br>
&quot;That doesn't matter, but it's enough to do your job and more. I took the liberty of scribing down your assignment on my mattress sheets, so read it carefully and remember it before destroying it. Do this and you can have everything that was mine.&quot;<br>
&quot;Everything?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, anything you want from me is yours.&quot;<br>
The man looked over the poorly scrawled notes and nodded before slipping back into the shadows.<br>
<br>
*    *      *<br>
<br>
<br>
The sky was still silver with the promise of sunrise when a pair of guards came to wake Fenye. They led her from her cell to the large central square of Felwithe, where Jyleel stood waiting, and a large crowd surrounding them. It wasn't long before her armor was donned, and with a few quick motions of her fingers she began to cast protection spells on her.<br>
&quot;No spells.&quot; Jyleel said in a straight, no-nonsense voice.<br>
Several nearby enchanters stood ready to dispell the magic Fenye had cast upon herself, and she felt the protections slip away as if she never had them.<br>
Jyleel stepped into the center of the elven ring of people, and withdrew his blade. It was long and slender, made for fast strikes and deadly accuracy. His shield was well known for blocking even the most crushing blows, as it was forged of adamantium and cooled in a vat of pure dragon blood after many enchantments were cast into it. He slid down his visor and touched the tip of his sword to his face, signaling he was ready for combat.<br>
With fluid motion, Fenye released her sword from it's scabbard, and the gleaming runes along the blade began to glow with utter power. She grasped it in the two handed grip she was famous for, and lowered the tip of the blade to the ground, accepting the challenge.<br>
<br>
The two hurled themselves at each other furiously, the runes on Fenye's sword making gold trails of magical light behind her swings, almost creating the illusion she had ribbons tied to the blade. Sparks showered  on the ground as the blades clashed again and again. <br>
Jyleel struck with amazing speed, his blade becoming a mere blur to Fenye's eyes, and scoring several hits that left blood trailing down her armor. With no shield, she had to rely on her skills to parry his attacks and make her own before he struck again, and this was proving increasingly difficult with each strike she suffered.<br>
In a stroke of luck, her blade summoned a fiery wrath around it, and shot out towards Jyleel, consuming him in a orange and red whirl of flames. Staggering back from the massive unleashed magical burst, he launched back into her again. <br>
Seizing the opportunity to strike, she dropped her sword low, and make an arc towards his knees. Jyleel's shield managed to deflect the blow, but the blade still fell onto his foot, cutting through his armor as easy as a searing hot blade would cut through a pad of butter.<br>
Blood streaked across the stone ground as he danced around her lamely, defending himself against her flurry of attacks. <br>
Then the sword began to summon it's flames once again...<br>
<br>
The battle went on for what seemed an eternity, with Fenye slowling gaining the upper hand. Jyleel now stood gasping for air on one side of the ring, Fenye frozen in a defense/attack stance on the other side, awaiting his next move.<br>
The amount of blood loss was considerable, splotched across the ground like an insane artist painting a picture. <br>
Jyleel had little strength left in him, and his pre-battle enchantments had already worn off, making him a much easier foe for Fenye. But he had to win, or she would walk free. <br>
Throwing himself at Fenye in almost a beserker type state, he kept his shield at mid level and sword raised high for a powerful downward stroke.<br>
Fenye met his strike with an upward thrust, effectively giving her a shower of sparks from the clash of the two magical swords. Swirling her feet into a kneeling position she arced the sword across and down again, slicing a cut along Jyleel's midsection. <br>
The clang of his sword hitting the stone ground let her know the battle was hers.<br>
&quot;You.. y.. you will not live past this.. past this.. day,&quot; he managed to wheeze out of his blood flecked lips. He looked down to find himself holding his entrails which were slowly spilling out from his body. In a final exhale, he lay dead on the ground.<br>
Fenye stood up, and surveyed the surrounding crowd, expecting the mob to stab at her with fists and swords, but it was just the silence of a stunned audience.<br>
Furrowing her brow in thought, she only had a second to glance at the incoming shadows behind her as four of the largest guards grabbed her and hauled her off to the front of the clerical guild, where she saw the towering structure that would end her life.<br>
Shouts of &quot;Hang her! Hang her!&quot; roared from the crowd, as the guards hauled the female martyr up the steps and slipped a noose around her neck. With no hesitation, they released the support and she dropped several feet, the rope slowly tightening around her neck as she struggled to free herself.<br>
&quot;Captain! It's horrible!&quot; a panicked young paladin shouted as he ran to the front of the gallows, where Fenye was suspended, fruitlessly gasping for air that wouldn't come.<br>
&quot;The children, they .. oh dear Mother save us all.. they are dead!&quot;<br>
&quot;What nonsense do you speak of?&quot;<br>
The two continued to shout at each other, but Fenye stopped struggling, and let her fate come to her. Barely managing a smile, she shot a glance towards the Captain of the Guard. The last thing she saw was his grim face as the boy told him of how someone or something had poisoned every child in Felwithe, and how the vicious poison quickly ate away thier flesh, leaving a mushy pile of flesh and bones. Her vision blurred, then began to go into a red fog as the capillaries in her eyes burst from asphyxiation, but she could still hear the screams of nearly every adventurer who brought thier families here to watch this, nearly every mother and father.<br>
&quot;Archers!&quot; the Captain screamed. Instantly, the air was torn with the hissing of arrows as they struck the dangling woman, snuffing out the life in her body.<br>
The limp corpse swayed on the rope, but her revenge was done.<br>
<br>
Betrayal comes with a price, she thought to herself as the last arrow sank into her heart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubanixxchilled.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Banixx Chilled</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/21/01 4:41:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Betrayal is expensive</span><hr size=1> Bye. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upooferman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>pooferman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/21/01 5:36:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Betrayal is expensive</span><hr size=1> I don't get it Fenye...you made up for your own pain by striking out at the innocent? <p>Poofingman 56 Warrior
