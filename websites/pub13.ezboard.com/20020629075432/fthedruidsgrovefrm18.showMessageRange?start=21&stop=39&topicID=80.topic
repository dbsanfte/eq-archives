As long as the mob is not magic resistant, or has been suitably debuffed.<br>
<br>
Big fights would last long enough for 2 or 3 WFs, at least, to be cast and take effect.  Because the damage is over time, we avoid the jump in aggro that a DD doing that damage would cause.  It also would be useful in short XP groups, where the fights last often longer than a minute.  It wouldn't be useful for fights that last less than a minute, like full XP groups killing weaker blues or the multiple-group raids where the lead-in mobs are overpowered quickly, but then, no DoT would be.<br>

<br>
we have two top line dots now, wd and bor.  why oh why would you replace the higher damage higher level one and keep the lower level lower damage one?  that would be just silly.  look at it as a function of damage over time.  replacing bor instead of wd, our damage would be 387 damage higher per minute.  that adds up over time to be a great deal.<br>
<br>
i know one of the worries would be the resist rate.  whether SOME want to admit it or not, there is a higher resist rate for combo spells, seen both in our own experiences and acknowledged by verant.  fine, then advocate it as a damage only spell with no debuff components.  you can even say you removed the debuffs to act as a &quot;penalty&quot; for it being such high damage.  verant loves penalties, i bet they'd be more likely to go for it then =P<br>
<br>
we've also all acknowledged that there is a serious problem with bor regarding its fizzle rate.  whether they get around to fixing it or not, if verant even acknowledges the problem, replacing it with another fire line dot would help.<br>
<br>
i'm alteration spec, another dot of whichever line will be the same mana-wise to me as long as they are the same efficiency.  however i also realize half of us are evoc spec, so they would get a big bonus from any new dot being from the fire line.  it also makes more sense to use the line that will give 50% of us a mana savings, rather than use the line that will give less about 0.01% of us mana savings.<br>
<br>
then there is also the &quot;we are druids&quot; argument.  we are suppose to be masters of the natural forces, ie fire and cold.  thats why our main nukes are always fire/cold, why we can debuff fire and cold but not the other three, etc.  it makes more sense to me for us to get a fire dot than a magic based dot.<br>
<br>
or.... i would propose a cold dot... but then we'd need a cold debuffer to use with it =P  however this is a novel idea and may get more notice from the powers that be. <p>-K<br>

If you are talking about a spell that does not stack with WD, you are increasing druid DPS by approximately 11 on raids against low resist targets.  Perhaps I am speaking for myself, but upgrading my DPS from 30ish to 40ish on raids is not a high priority for me - particularly since it only applies to ONE druid per raid.<br>
<br>
Soloing, this spell would be essentially useless, except in the "kill this mob ASAP" quest mode.  Most folks will agree that speading mana-free DoTs over additional targets would be more effective than killing a single target quicker for xp-gathering.<br>
<br>
In a normal xp group, mobs aren't going to last long enough to spend 450 mana on them.  Druid rolls in a normal xp group were nicely explained by Lotus - PULL, DRUIDS!  Keep the melees hitting stuff and you've done a great job!<br>
<br>
I suppose I can see that this spell would be useful duoing with a melee, where you get the time to med.  But that makes it another limited use level 60 spell.  I have enough of those.<br>
<br>
I think the druids role in raids and groups would be expanded just as much by removing the snare effect from WoN.  If I really was asking for a level 60 spell, it would be a cold-based copy of RSD. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/02 1:20:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What would a druid level 60 DoT look like?</span><hr size=1> Alright, since there's no real consensus, I'll take a DoT upgrade back off the table as part of a "simple" changes proposal.<br>

So it looks like the 10% healing penalty, broken fizzle rates, and WoN fix are it as far as the simple changes go.  I'm assuming that Moonfire is already being looked at (per our inside source).<br>

True, I rarely see it resisted. But I also have to observe that it's not flagged in SPDAT as having a low resist.</b></i><br>
<br>
You don't see many things "flagged in SPDAT" for two reasons.  First, you're not looking at "SPDAT", you're looking at a program, written by a third party, which reads the file and attempts to interpret it.  There are aspects of that file that the program cannot interpret because the programmer did not design it.<br>
<br>
Second, there are <b>many</b> server-side changes to spells which are not reflected in this file and never will be.  Special resist values are one of these changes.  If you want to try an experiment, take any highly magic resistant (but not totally immune) NPC, and try casting the swarm line on the NPC a number of times.  Your resist rate will still be around 5%, even when all other magic spells will be resisted over 90% of the time.  Or, try casting it on a player -- it will never be resisted.  Most DoTs do NOT behave this way -- they behave like the flame lick line.<br>
<br>
<b><i> I would expect an upgrade to also be low resist, while still preserving about the same damage proportion relative to other classes that was seen at lower levels. I hardly think that keeping a spell line proportional across levels is unreasonable.</b></i><br>
<br>
The problem is, due to the resist differences, you would be giving druids a large damage advantage over all other classes.  Druids would once again be the DoT masters (like they were at level 50 way back when), and that may not sit will with some other players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueridalafar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eridalafar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/02 4:05:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Why level 60 for the new dot?<br>

Don't make all of ours spells level 60. Or us will earing: looking for a druid, but only for a level 60 one. <br>

Spay a few the level of the spells. Or we will get something like the pre-nerf manastone situation (raidleader: only casters with a manastone are comming to the raid; the rest go camping the manastone).<br>

<br>
The major benefit of an upgrade to the fire line versus the swarm line would be to give us two viable dots (the upgrade, and Wings of Death).  If it had a long duration and an AC debuff, it could give us some utility on the long Luclin uberAC bosses.<br>
<br>
The benefit of an upgrade to the swarm line versus the fire line is that it'd be easier to do for VI, since swarm only has a single effect to balance.  Our swarm line has been the only well developed DoT til now, and it's simple and logical to implement another one after L53.<br>
<br>
Again... we deserve both, in truth, but if we had to choose one, I'd choose an upgrade to BoR for reasons stated above.  I think we should include both in the proposal, along with the reasons for one to be implemented, the other to be implemented, and both to be implemented. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/02 4:41:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <b>Why level 60 for the new dot?<br>

<br>
Gut feel.  That's too much.  We're getting Moonfire looked at (I assume), an enhance Wildfire, an enhanced group thorns, and possibly a self only PoG.  Along with a dire charm for plants. (I'm interpreting a lot based on recent posts here.)<br>
<br>
We'd also be proposing removal of the 10% healing penalty, fizzle fixes on 5 or 6 spells, and a fix for Wrath of Nature.  Asking for two DoT enhancements on top of that is a bit much.  <br>
<br>
As for why not 58 or 59...it would reduce the total damage of the spell.  Our DoTs don't increase in damage per level.  They do the same damage as the day we get them, regardless of level.  Thus, if we're going to go for a DoT upgrade, we ought to go for the largest one we can get.  At 58 or 59, a reasonable damage total would be a couple hundred points below the 1980 I proposed, and quite frankly, it isn't worth the trouble (for Verant or us) to put in a new druid DoT with mid-range damage.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulalian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lalian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.data-techniques.net/cwm/otn/other/yleyes.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/02 4:56:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I really don't think a DoT upgrade would be useful in a grouping situation.

<br>
I'd just like to point out that any "highly magic immune" mob will be really hard to snare, really hard to root, and very mad at you for casting swarm dots over and over.  Just be careful when testing...<br>

On raids, I spend my mana probably 10% on buffing (Girdle of Karana, Regrowth, Circles) and 90% on healing (almost all Chloroblast).  I almost think that we could use another heal like Chloroblast but for more HP and mana for the same or similar casting time.  Or, make Nature's Recovery much more useful by making it heal the same amount in 5-6 ticks instead of what it is now (I don't think it looks very useful as is, but then again, I cannot scribe it).<br>

<br>
But so is Heat Blood, and any single damage over time dot.<br>
<br>
While I don't have &quot;hard&quot; evidence.  I will give you some &quot;soft&quot; evidence.<br>
<br>
While in a group in umbral plains, where the mobs have 10k to 20k hps.  I have watched a mob proove unslowable (resist 5+ times 60 enchanter) and unsnarable (resist 5+ time snare)<br>
yet the same mob I'll land every WD and Drones of doom (Rowyl bracers).  EVERY.  I'm almost shocked when resisted.<br>
<br>
While having some guild fun in Arena.  The same enchanter was owning people.  The SK &amp; I promptly replied she was doing so only cause we weren't dotting.  Call it hubris, but she replied go for it.. i'll take th 96 Rez.  Needless to say here 200 resist didn't do any good as suddenly the SK landed a Heat Blood (i believe) dot, and I landed WD and Drones.<br>
When all 3 landed right in a row, she became a firm believer in resists.<br>
<br>
Ultimatley, I think earlier posters nailed it.  The reason WD line, and the Necro Heat Line are resisted is cause thier pure dots.  No other effect to check resists against.<br>
<br>
Still an upgraded Dot would be nice.  but not as essential as some other fixes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uracmoor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Racmoor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/28/02 10:46:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What would a druid level 60 DoT look like?</span><hr size=1> Ok...This is a great discussion.  One thing that I notice on the druid board I don't notice on other boards discussing this type of thing is that actually are concerned how other classes feel about any upgrades we get.<br>
<br>
I really want a Cold Based DoT.  Level 59ish. Similiar to what was posted above.<br>
<br>
Another idea for a &quot;DoT&quot; is<br>
<br>
Curse of Nature<br>
Mana 200.  Duration 10ticks<br>
Drain 35 mana per tick and transfers it to the caster.<br>
Total mana drain 350<br>
<br>
I'm sure the mana dot would never fly...although I can hope.  RP could be something along the lines that this curse interferes with and intercepts the natural attunement of the phsyical manifestation(body) to the spiritual manifestation(soul).<br>

A swarm of insects would have a tendency to do that.<br>
