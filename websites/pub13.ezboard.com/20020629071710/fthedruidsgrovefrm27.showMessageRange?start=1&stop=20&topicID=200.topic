But then again who doesn't?  <br><br>Sadly, avoiding faction hits isn't as easy in DAoC as it is in EQ because a lot of the quests given out by NPCs requires you to kill mobs that reduces your faction.  Some quests you can skip but some are just too good to pass up.<br><br>For example, I did a quest that started in Ardee, that required me to kill a lucraduane (leprechaun faction) and return a teapot to a NPC in Howth.  When I returned the teapot, the NPC wanted me to fetch some ingredients for her to make some tea with her teapot.  So off I went to find some lunatishees (blackthorn faction) to kill so I can get the leaves for the quest.  Well it just so happened that when I pulled one lunatishee, 2 came.  No prob, I killed them, I lived, but I'm now KoS to lunatishees and blackthorns.  Being that I've never killed either of those mobs before, 2 mobs dropped my faction from neutral, to aggressive.  And I've noticed that's the case with most mobs. :(<br><br>It turns out this was one of those quests that could've been skipped because the reward was a tad bit of exp (nothing I couldn't get soloing a few blues), and 5 silver.  Whoopie doo.  Oh well.<br><br>Chassaria mentioned she wished she never screwed up her leprechaun faction.  Well...me too, cause those boogers are EVERYWHERE.  I started playing during beta and I learned that lesson there, fortunately.  However, unfortunately, my frequent hunting partner is a bard, and for his 11th lvl quest, he has to kill a named lucraduane.  So after helping him kill one measly little leprechaun, I'm now KoS to anything on the leprechaun faction.  (Remember, I had to kill one lucraduane for that silly teapot quest, tallying up my leprechaun slaughters to a whopping 2.  So again, 2 kills = KoS.)<br><br>Fortunately for me, we were able to do my 11th lvl druid quest before we did the bard quest that required us to kill a named leprechaun, because for the druid quest, I had to talk to (not kill) a named leprechaun.  Hopefully, I won't have to talk to anymore leprechauns for my quests in the future, because I haven't discovered anyway to repair my leprechaun faction.  :(<br><br>So as a tip for anyone playing a druid in Hibernia, be sure to do your 11th lvl quest before you screw up your leprechaun faction.<br><br>I really wish it wasn't so easy to decrease your faction with NPCs.  I mean...2 kills and you're KoS?  That seems a bit excessive to me.  Not to mention it's currently very hard to repair any damaged faction. :( <p><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/NyssaSigsm.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usanterre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Santerre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/14/01 12:30:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=200.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:  Monsters you wished you stayed friends with.</span><hr size=1> If I were an elf, and I knew you killed two elves, I'd want you dead as well.

If you're in Connla, look across the river and you'll see a guard tower.  You can get to it by either swimming (becareful of water badgers that aggro) or you can walk a bit North and take the bridge across.  Torrance the druid trainer is there, along with some guards, and a banker.  Slevin is on the other side of the tower from the druid trainer and the banker.<br><br>As for quests, make sure that everytime you ding, check in with your local druid trainer.  If he doesn't have a quest for you, and you're of lvl to get a quest, he will refer you to someone who will give you a quest.  When you first started out, your trainer should've given you a quest each lvl up to 4th lvl, then you should get one at 7th, 11th, 15th...and so on.  It skips a few lvls but you will get quests that yields some REALLY nice class specific items, so always check with your trainer.<br><br>Also, don't neglect various NPC's quests.  Here's something I learned.  If you're travelling around and you see a mail delivery NPC (they wander along the roads), try to stop him and talk to him.  He'll often offer you 2 options.  Ask about both of them.  He'll reply with &quot;I have nothing for you at this time&quot; for one of them, and refer you to someone else for the other.  Then go to that person and talk to him/her.  Also try talking to NPCs you sell your goods to.  Try the &quot;/whisper task&quot; command.  That way half the people around you don't get spammed with you asking for a task. <p><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/NyssaSigsm.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/16/01 8:23:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=200.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.daocdivine.homestead.com/files/DivineEmblem.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 11th level druid quest</span><hr size=1> I hunted a lot of Lunas and blackthorns with my Druid.

They increase your siabra faction, which will greatly help with your 20th lvl epic quest (if you're a druid that is.)  Reason being is you'll need to free a druid imprisoned by the siabras in a siabra camp in the Cliffs of Moher.  If you have neutral siabra faction, they will not attack you when you're talking to the druid and trying to free him, thus making it a LOT easier for you to complete that part.  But considering you made your post about a month ago, I'll assume you've already gotten that far. :)<br><br>Another thing I noticed that would be a pain in the butt to be KoS to are sheeries.  UGH those boogers are everywhere.  My bf's bard became KoS to them after 2 kills (one for an optional quest) and it's a pain in the butt. :(<br><br>As for the leprechaun factions, they can now be reversed.  If you care to fix your leprechaun faction (which I haven't bothered with) you can kill cluricauns (sp?) in Lough Gur (Innis Carthaig.)  Keep in mind that if something is gray to you, you won't get a faction hit for killing them. <p><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=9442&raceid=1&classid=25"><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/NyssaSig.jpg" ALT="Click to see character stats."
