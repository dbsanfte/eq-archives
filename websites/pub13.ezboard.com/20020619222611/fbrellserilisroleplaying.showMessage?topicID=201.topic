<br>
Four years later…<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey friend, ya gotta get movin'&quot;<br>
Raff lifted his head slowly from the table, a thin string of saliva trailing from his lip. He opened blood-shot eyes, peered weakly at the bartender, and blinked.<br>
<br>
“I said you gotta get outta here” the balding bartender said, a scowl breaking out on his face.  “Yer tha last ones here, an I wanna get home.”<br>
<br>
Raff blinked again and brought his hands up to his face to rub some sense into his foggy brain.  He looked across the table at a mixture of empty wine bottles and ale steins, evidence of his most recent drinking binge. Raff always refused to let the bartender or tavern wench take his glasses away before he was done for the night.  It gave him a sense of accomplishment to look upon the rows of empty bottles and mugs after he was finished.<br>
<br>
A female groaned beside him and stirred slightly reminding Raff that she had been leaning on him.  He focused on a few gold coins on the table and palmed two before thrusting his hand inside the shirt of the woman awakening beside him.  After allowing himself to linger a few moments on her breasts he withdrew his hand, leaving the coins in the woman’s shirt.<br>
<br>
“Raff?” the woman said weakly as she grabbed for his hand.<br>
<br>
“Closing time” Raff muttered as he pulled himself away from the woman and slowly stood up.<br>
<br>
“But honey, aren’t ya takin’ me with ya?” she slurred, still rousing from a drunken sleep.<br>
<br>
Without looking at her, his hands rubbing his eyes, he replied drunkenly. “Not tonight. Tonight I don’t have the energy.”<br>
<br>
“But Raff…” the woman started, her hand reaching for his.<br>
<br>
The bartender pressed a massive finger into Raff’s chest, causing him to nearly fall back into his seat.  He pointed to the woman still sitting at the table.  “I want that whore outta here!” he growled.  “Yer tha one who brought her here, an’ yer tha one that’s takin’ her outta here.”<br>
<br>
Raff teetered back to stability and scooped the coins off the table and into his belt pouch.  “She’s already paid for.  Why don’t you take her home?”<br>
<br>
“I happen to be married ya stupid bugger.”<br>
<br>
Raff looked the bartender over appraisingly.  He had the look of a man who had more than enough to eat, but instead of fat, the extra food had turned to muscle and bone.  He was easily six and a half feet tall but he looked stocky even at that height.  Raff noted with some concern that it would take at least three of his own forearms to equal the mass of one of the bartender’s.  The man’s thighs were larger than Raff’s waist.<br>
<br>
Now finished scooping the coins, Raff turned slowly to look at the bartender, blinked twice and said “Well, from the looks of you, maybe you could use another woman at home.  Hell, maybe your wife would enjoy another body in her bed”.<br>
<br>
The bartender lashed out at Raff with heavy fist, catching the drunken man squarely in his jaw and hurtling him against the table.  Raff fell backward onto the table and it buckled under his weight.  Bottles and mugs scattered to the floor in a crash of breaking glass.  Raff, his back leaning against the table, put a hand to his jaw and rubbed it while the large man laughed at him.  He shook his head to clear it and slowly slid upward along the table.<br>
<br>
“If…” Raff spoke, so quietly he voice was barely audible.<br>
<br>
“You…” he reached out a hand to steady himself against a chair as he pulled himself to a standing position.<br>
<br>
“Ever…” Raff’s voice became a hiss, every syllable dripping with venom as he turned slowly toward the bartender.  <br>
<br>
The large man stared back at Raff as he folded his arms casually in the confident gesture of a man who knows he’s in a position of superior strength.  A half smirk formed on his fat lips, a fold of flesh within a face covered in four-day-old growth of stubble.<br>
<br>
“If I ever WHAT, ya dung eatin’ bastard?”  The bartender narrowed his eyes, daring the smaller man to challenge him.<br>
<br>
Raff, moving with a quickness that stunned the larger man, jammed a knee into the bartender’s groin, doubling him over.  As the bartender grabbed his groin, Raff slipped behind him and grabbed a fistful of his hair, jerking the man’s head back and pulling him off balance.  Before he could react Raff had the jagged edge of a broken wine bottle pressed against his neck.  The man babbled incoherently as the sharp glass cut ever so slightly into his neck, causing a small line of blood to form around the sharp edge of the broken bottle.  A thin rasp escaped from his mouth and he was instantly still.<br>
<br>
“As I was saying” Raff breathed, his voice a deadly whisper in the other man’s ear.  “If you ever touch me again, I’ll make sure you never touch anything again.”  Raff paused and pressed the glass harder against the man’s throat.  “Am I understood?”<br>
<br>
“I… I donna want no trouble…” the bartender blubbered.  “Just leave my bar, and you donna hafta pay fer tha damages.”<br>
<br>
“What? Why you little prick!”  Raff shouted.  “You just pushed me into your damned table! I should cut your throat for that.”  Again he lowered his voice to barely a whisper. “Give me a good reason why I shouldn’t gut you like the pig you are right here.”<br>
<br>
The bartender paused, obviously considering his answer carefully.  His eye trailed down to the ring on Raff’s finger.  It was a silver ring with the unmistakable markings of Erollisi Marr, the goddess of Love.  He licked his lips slowly and answered carefully.  “You shouldna kill me ‘cause the goddess Marr would be offended with such an act.”<br>
<br>
Raff’s eyes widened at the man’s response and then slowly narrowed as a chilling coldness crept into them.  For a moment he seemed to stare at nothing, his eyes filled with an inhuman look.<br>
<br>
“Wrong answer” Raff growled.  “Wrong damn answer” he said again, this time louder than before.  With deliberate slowness he pulled the sharp edge of the glass across the man’s throat, slicing deeply into his skin.  Blood poured out from his neck as Raff released his grip.  He watched impassively as the man fell to his knees, his hand clutching futilely at this throat as thick crimson oozed around his fingers.  After a few moments of sputtering and desperate gasps for air, the bartender pitched forward and fell to the ground, lifeless.<br>
<br>
Raff dropped the broken bottle and bent down to wipe the blood from his hand on the tunic of the dead man.  As he did he was dimly aware of screaming, and a small part of his mind urged him to get away immediately.  He turned and calmly walked away, stopping momentarily to retrieve another bottle of wine from behind the bar.<br>
