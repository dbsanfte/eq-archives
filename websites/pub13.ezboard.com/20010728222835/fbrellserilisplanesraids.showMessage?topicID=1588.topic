I'd like a Vote to make FG's a non issue when Ragefire is up.  I urge you to vote that it's ok to kill ragefire when he's up without having to worry about the reservation system.<br>
<br>
This would keep the current reservation system in place, but allow clerics who need ragefire to go friggin kill ragefire. <br>
<br>
This is i hope a compromise at least in some part between the FFA and the Reservation crowd.<br>

<br>
1) Use a fd monk to camp the spot.<br>
<br>
2) Use a tracker in the Stoney room verify if he is up.<br>
<br>
Both of these methods would allow a person or group to check if Ragefire is up and not interfere with a FG raid.<br>
<br>
Pro: Clerics needing Ragefire can assemble the raid group and go in.<br>
<br>
Con: A 40's raid crew which may have had scheduling issues to overcome to attend that date loses the chance at killing them.<br>
<br>
I think you would need to add in some other guidelines to prevent abuse so the FG's are not just swiped.<br>
<br>
Make FG's only reservable by a lvl40's raid crew and not by the 50  crowd. This would open up more dates and times so the 50  crowd could just take them out when unscheduled.<br>
<br>
If a cleric is going in after Ragefire a reasonable effort should be made to accommodate the scheduled FG raid crew. <br>
<br>
Under 2 hours they should wait or contact the raid leader/guild and work something out.<br>
<br>
2 to 6 hours Is a grey area. It's a long time to hold up a Ragefire killing but it doesn't allow for a good respawn of the FG's. Maybe put in a rule that the Cleric that goes after Ragefire in this time must contact the raid crew and see if that crew can take the FG's down sooner if the raid party is not around, let Ragefire be taken out but it needs to be the Ragefire groups responsibility to contact the raid crew and maybe help them raid a different spot.<br>
<br>
If 6 hours away or more let them kill the FG's at the speed a ragefire crew could kill the FG's the FG raid may only be delayed an hour or 2. The raid crew should still be contacted if they are on or once they do get on and something should be worked out.<br>
<br>
It's a lot to ask for the Cleric wanting to kill Ragefire to then work out a compromise to make everyone happy in the end. I am sure toes would get stepped on and some would be mad that the FG's were not up.<br>
<br>
In Verant's opinion neither side is entitled to the respective spawns. We need to communicate and build a bridge to work together so both parties goals can be reached and achieved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaraden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 621<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/8/01 10:56:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'd like to propose a change to FG's</span><hr size=1> Just following the principle of keep it simple, so that it can't be screwed with. <br>
<br>
FG's already have a problem of people ignoring or not checking the reservation board.  <br>
<br>
Also precious few are using FG's as a raid training ground.  This change would have little effect on most of us.  I've done FG's with one group, highest level was 53.<br>
<br>
This change allows the reservation system to stay in place, but removes the Screw Job that the clerics are getting.<br>

When the raids set up for the FGs start showing up to find the FGs dead cause Ragefire was up people are going to be pissed.  Doesn't matter if the Ragefire crew helped get a cleric epic.  The FG raid will be pissed and you will hear endless whining and bitching.  This will continue until enough people are so pissed off about it that they will just go kill FGs whenever they feel like it because scheduling it has not gotten them anywhere. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Action=View&Profile=0&Id=60309">Jaradis Stormcaller</a> - 53rd Mystic - (Kael Faction)<br>

Brell already has a problem of folks ignoring reservations and going after ragefire no matter what mob is in the way.  <br>
<br>
You may not agree that this is a good thing,  but the fact of the matter is that it's already happened.  We as a community need to do something.  <br>
<br>
Yes there will be FG raids that were scheduled that get messed up by this.   But that's happening NOW anyway.<br>

Personally, I think this takes alot of balls to even propose. Breaking it down it means the *unscedualed* Ragefire Raid takes precadence over the *scedualed* FG Raid. This just further perpetuates the anomosity between mid levels and Uber levels. If you want your epic, work something out with the FG Raid, if there is one scedualed. Part of getting an epic is patiance. Same goes with getting on the raid list. <br>
<br>
Here are some proposed compromises a Ragefire group can make:<br>
<br>
1) Provide a high level puller to single pull FG's if the FG Raiders desire such. At the same time offer free Rezzes to any that die during the raid and high level buffs for all raiders.<br>
<br>
2) If the FG Raiders continue to insist they want to try to take down Ragefire and have their clerics roll on the drop then let them make the attempt. When they do make the attempt, the Ragefire Uber Group will step back and watch. If the FG Raiders fail, then the Ragefire group steps in and finishes Ragefire off and attains looting rights. Then the Ragefire group procedes to rez the fallen FG Group.<br>
<br>
This gives the *RESERVED* FG Group the ability to do their raid and shoot for the stars, if they desire, as well as gives the Ragefire Group a chance to do their thing. <br>
<br>
Let it be noted that it took 4 attempts for me to get Lucan for my Soulfire. All of those attempts had Lucan groups attempt to take him down within an hour of my planned raid time. The fourth attempt failed, that is why I was able to get him as he was still up. Frustrating as it was, it taught me that patience all along the way is the *only* way to succeed in the Epic Quest. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/krungle101/myhomepage/krunglesig.jpg" border=0></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaraden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 626<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/8/01 12:01:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'd like to propose a change to FG's</span><hr size=1> Krungle, apparantly you are unfamiliar with the cleric epic quest.

<br>
the epic dropping Ragefire can only be spawned by a cleric at that point in the epic quest.  AFTER chardok royals have been done and king taken out.  Yes this is high level stuff.  a cleric on your version of a normal FG raid of mid levels doesn't have that item to make the lewt dropping Ragefire spawn.  The idea of clerics rolling on his drop is a non issue.<br>
<br>
As is, there are not many folks running raids for the pre 50's,  and i've got the balls to propose this due to the abuse of the FG system i've already seen.  I'm not a cleric, just a concerned brell citizen trying to put up a proposal to help smooth some FG issues with.   <br>
<br>
Like i said, not everyone will agree it's for the best.  But can you agree that it's better than FFA on em which is what will eventually happen if we don't compromise somehow.<br>

Which is why I'm saying this new system you are proposing isn't any different than what we have now.  It doesn't change anything other than switching who is &quot;right&quot; and who is &quot;wrong&quot; when the complaining happens.  Right now the crew that ignores the reservations and kills Ragefire is &quot;wrong&quot; and the FG raid is &quot;right&quot;.  All your system does is reverse that.   It doesn't solve the issues with the FGs/Ragefire. It just allows an open loop hole to disregard the rules.  What is the point of having rules if you have an open loop hole to disregard them?<br>
<br>
People will continue to take down the FGs to get to Ragefire.  Didn't the VS list set the precident here?  If people are going to ignore the reservations then why have them?   VS was removed because some weren't going to follow the reservations.  Unlike VS though, some guilds have openly stated they will kill the FGs if Ragefire is up regardless of the reservation rules.   So why have them? <br>
<br>
Our rules only exist and have any meaning because a vast majority agree with them and follow them.  I hardly see the FG vote as being a Vast Majority.<br>

So if the FG Group does not have the ability to make the Epic peice spawn then the Ragefire Group should take precidence *at that point*<br>
<br>
Until then, all else I said still stands. Clerics wanting Ragefire just have to be patient and wait until the FG Group does their thing.<br>
<br>
I am still open to hear a compromise but not one that gives an unscedualed event precadence over a scedualed raid.<br>

I think i've outlined my position pretty clearly and welcome feedback.  I truly want to see FG's get to be a much less of an issue.<br>
**********************************************************<br>
<br>
So why have a reservation on FG's if those who voted aren't a vast majority of those who follow brells rules.  the others just ignore it obviously, else they would have voted.<br>
<br>
I'd say around 550 people voting on the FG's represent a sizeable portion of brells FG raidable folks.  the fact that in essense half voted yes half no, and the fact that we keep doing FG vote after FG vote, and in the meanwhile not everyone accepts the legitamacy of FG reservations,  indicates to me a need for some sort of change instead of the same vote every 2 months. <br>
<br>
If you don't think that i have a valid point for compromise here.  I suggest that you offer a solution along with your critique, becuase it's quite obvious that FG's are being abused as is, and this whole reservation thing with em is getting ridiculous. <br>
<br>
Nothing personal here at all,  i just see a never ending FG war going on with constant revotes and something needs to change.<br>

when ragefire is up and i'm ever at that point i will check to see if a fg raid is scheduled and try to work something out , and i will try my best to make everyone happy. but in the end i will kill ragefire it takes what 3 hours for a fg repop? i camped 1 epic piece off a green mob for over 25 hours so don't tell me about patience. in fact i think it may have driven me a little more mad than i was <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unasren.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nasren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/8/01 1:11:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'd like to propose a change to FG's</span><hr size=1> For the Record Yes I feel I should be allowed to take down Ragefire if he is up and I am logged in.

<br>
Would I try to communicate and work something out? Yes, Communication will go a long ways. Would I be willing to lend a hand to FG raiders? Sure, it helps me and them out.<br>
<br>
Do I agree with reservations? A year ago I thought they were good. Now I see the amount of problems they cause and wonder if they are truly worth it. <br>
<br>
Very sad if Ragefire was up before this patch I had a friend camping the spawn spot and finally had to go to bed for work with 4 hours left before the patch. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uveldanlionsfury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldan Lionsfury</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/8/01 1:41:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'd like to propose a change to FG's</span><hr size=1> I think it's sad that everyone decided to attack Araden because he decided to open his mouth and help try to make the system better.<br>

Krungle, although in theory, I like your idea about having a discussion about this.  Look at how quickly this discussion degenerated.  This kind of forum will not work.  There's too many sharks willing to rip an idea apart that has a few holes in it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udrillin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drillin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#CC9900>(5/8/01 2:02:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'd like to propose a change to FG's</span><hr size=1> Personally I dont think there is a bottleneck on ragefire due to chardok king being killed.  I know 3 clerics who are at ragefire stage and missed out on those.  I have been trying to go in and check tracking daily from when I hear Naggy is killed but have been lax lately.  A chardok royal raid can get 3-4 clerics heads in a day where a ragefire only takes care of 1-2 a week (given amount naggy is killed and server resets).<br>
<br>
I think this idea was a good one, and I support it, and I voted YES on the recent FG vote.<br>
<br>
To those who were just negative, until you offer your own suggestion with your negatively dont expect others to find your opinions of much use, I know I dont.<br>

I didn't know that it was required to offer a suggestion in order to comment on something he put up for discussion.  Having a discussion where everyone says how wonderful the idea is and no one says anything against it because they will be ignored is well ... not a discussion. He stated his opinions, I stated mine.  No one is right no one is wrong.  We just have different opinions.  If you think my opinions aren't valid because they don't match yours well thats your right.<br>
<br>
I've said my opinions.  Take them as you like.  I don't even hunt FGs ever or care about Ragefire so I'm done with this topic.  Feel free to do what you like.  Hope you find something that works for everyone.<br>

If you can do that, then it's legitimate to reserve every spawn in the game.<br>
<br>
Let the 35-50 crew reserve FG's with the understanding that sometimes, a higher level group may have to go through to get to ragefire.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see how many people that were the &quot;guardians of the L40's&quot; would mind if only 30-50's could reserve FG's.  I suspect that there are several 50+ people that complained about the greed of the people who wanted to take FG's FCFS who would start to complain if their chance to reserve FG's for the loot would be removed. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1588.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1588.topic&start=41&stop=41>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1593.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1589.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1588.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1588.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1588.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
