As I sat in the snow of the Iceclad Ocean, I waited for my friends to show up, Tindias, and Xytol. Our plan was the travel through Iceclad, then through the Eastern Wastes, then through the giant city of Kael, and to the Plain of Growth. They had heard rumors that people can get in at ANY lvl. As I, Wabin, sat waiting in the snow, I thought about it. I thought about entering the Plain of Growth, seeing all the amazing creatures of Tunare, and then finally seeing Tunare herself. <br>
        I then finally saw two of my friends come over the snow covered hill, Tindias and Xytol. Tindias was a lvl 39 Druid, with Xytol, and lvl 24 Ranger, both of Tunare. Iquredash was already waiting at the enterance of Kael, while hunting some giants to kill time. He and I were using our telepathy to talk to each other. &quot;Hello, friend,&quot; said Xytol and Tindias. &quot;Hello…ready to go? Iquredash is waiting,&quot; said I. &quot;Sure. I can't WAIT to get there!&quot; said the young Ranger. &quot;Take off your SoW, my speed song is faster,&quot; I said.<br>
        We made our journey West, to the Eastern Wastes. We ran full speed with my speed song, which was a bad idea…I now realize I should have WALKED! &quot;Dear LORD! Wabin, HELP!!!&quot; I heard Xytol shout at me. I turned around to see two snow cougars attacking Xytol and Tindias, with one more chasing me. Tindias was snaring and blasting all that he could, and healing when we were injured. All of the cougars soon agroed to him, and being a Druid with low HP and no more mana, he was killed. &quot;NOOO!!!!!&quot; I shouted at the cougars. &quot;DIE!!&quot; said I and Xytol at the same time. The cougars then agroed to Xytol. &quot;Uh oh&quot; I heard him mumble under his breath as he clubbed until he had his throat slashed by the three cougars. They turned and looked at me. I threw on my speed song and ran as fast as I could toward what I thought was Kael. The cougars soon lost my tracks and had to stop.<br>
        I couldn't find Kael, so I decided to go back to the bridge and wait for Xytol and Tindias as they crossed it. &quot;You alright, Wabin?&quot; asked Tindias. &quot;I'm fine,&quot; I replied. &quot;Come…let us get your corpses…I will use my corpse locating song to find them.&quot; &quot;Let's be more careful this time though.&quot;<br>
        We were running through Eastern Wastes looking for Kael. Iquredash was still waiting for us there. He gave me the location of it and the three of us went running toward it. At the time, none of us could find locations very well, so we were stuck running around the Ry`Gorr Fort. We must have been running around it in circles for about 10 minutes, and another 5 looking for the enterance INSIDE of the fort, trying not to get killed by the frozen, blue Orcs.<br>
        &quot;I've found it!&quot; Yelled Tindias. &quot;We were way off…we need to learn how to find locations, haha!&quot; he joked. &quot;Come and get us then, so we can finally meet up with Iquredash and get inside the city…it's FREEZING out here!&quot; said Xytol. The young Elf had no idea that Kael was even colder inside than outside. Tindias showed up and took us there. &quot;Almost here,&quot; he said. &quot;Just a few more--ACK!&quot; he shouted as we all fell off the side of the ramp at the Kael enterance. WHAM, WHACK, THOMP, SMASH, CRASH is what I heard all the way down. The smashing of bones, the thomping of our bodies hitting the ground over and over again, the crashing and whacking noise of our armor breaking. I opened my eyes and the sky was spinning, I looked to my side and could see someone standing there, but it was blurry so I didn't know who it was just yet. The sky slowly stopped spinning, and the figure became clear, and I finally realized it was Iquredash. He was asking me if I was alright. &quot;No…not exactly,&quot; I said. I looked at my armor to find that it was pretty badly roughed up and broken in several places. &quot;We'll get that fixed up when we get back to Freeport,&quot; he said. I sat up and looked on the ground beside me. Xytol and Tindias were once again dead.<br>
        Iquredash and I waited for a while. Finally Tindias and Xytol showed up. After they looted their corpses, we began our journey through the giant city of Kael Drakkal. I was the only one that had been in there before this time, so I was the leader. We all had fresh SoWs on us from right outside the city. To avoid anyone loosing track of me running through the city, I walked and they ran behind me. We walked through the city, saw 2-4 people there total hunting the giants. &quot;Let's hurry up, it's even colder in here than it was out there!&quot; stated Xytol. The rest of us looked at each other and snickered without Xytol noticing.<br>
        As I looked around, I didn't quite recognize this place. I then realized that I had made a wrong turn back there where I THOUGHT was certainly the wrong way, which is why I ended up here. &quot;Unfortunately, we need to turn back…I made a wrong turn. No worries though, I can easily find it. It's right over there,&quot; I said as we turned around. &quot;Whoa, look at this ice! It's like a balcony over here!&quot; said Tindias excitedly. &quot;No, wait!&quot; yelled Iquredash, aware of the dangers. But it was too late. Tindias ran over to the ice, slipped and plummeted to the bottom, hitting the ground with a loud THUD right in the middle of a circle of giants, where my invisibility song did not reach him. &quot;Wow, that can't be good…you okay?&quot; asked Xytol as he ran to the ice. &quot;NO! You fool, stop!&quot; yelled Iquredash and I. But it was once again too late. Xytol slipped on the ice and fell into the middle of the same circle of giants that Tindias had fallen into. My invisibility song no longer reached either of them. The giants stood, towering over their enemies, ready to attack them at any moment. And so they did in a few more seconds. Tindias and Xytol both ran toward Iquredash and me…but unfortunately, when I turned to ask Iquredash what to do, he was already gone…making his way toward the way that he thought to be the Wakening Lands. I hoped that the giants wouldn't see me with my invisibility song on, but they did somehow, I guessed since they saw my group members, they see me.<br>
        WHAM was the sound I heard. I ran as fast as I could toward the way that I KNEW was to the Eastern Wastes, running past giants with every step. The entire city filled with the sounds of giants screaming at me. I turned to look back only for a moment to see that the halls had NO more room whatsoever…they were filled with giants chasing me. Tindias and Xytol were already dead, Iquredash managed to get to the Wakening Lands, and I was alone in the city. I got very near the exit of the city, where I saw a man hunting giants. He saw how many were chasing me and didn't hesitate to run like HELL to the exit of the city. With hardly any life left, I managed to get out alive. Tindias and Xytol were once again no longer among the living.<br>
        They were already there at the exit waiting for me, we had all been bound right before entering the city. We waiting for Iquredash to give us the word that he had dragged the corpses to the exit of the city. When he did so, we all buffed ourselves and once again headed in. &quot;This time, follow me!! Do NOT take a detour to go look at the pretty ice!&quot; I growled at them.<br>
<br>
        We had finally managed to get through the city. We were now in the Wakening Lands, getting warm from the humidity and the heat in this area. It looked more like Kunark than Velious. We invised ourselves with my song, and we SoWed ourselves thanks to Iquredash and we ran toward the given location of the tower at the lake that was the portal to the Elven Heaven…the Plain of Growth.<br>
        We ran as fast as we could toward the given location, trying not to bump into anything along the way, or give away to the giants and other creatures that we were around them. Then we saw it. A lake, with water the looked green because it was reflecting the green trees that were so large, they blocked out the sky. In the lake there was a tower standing tall, with some fauns guarding it. We realized then where we were and turned our invisibility spells off. The fauns did not attack us, the goat people just stood there, looking at us. So we went into the tower. Some of the fauns would sell things to us if we tried to buy from them, but we were not interested in that. We were interested in what was on TOP of the tower…the portal to the Plain of Growth. <br>
        We climbed to the top and saw what we had been looking for and finally found on our long and tiresome journey that lasted for days on end. We saw there, on the top of the tower in the lake in the Wakening Lands, a tree looking object with a glowing light coming out of part of its small trunk. Iquredash, knowing certainly that HE would get in because he was over lvl 46, was the first to approach. When he touched the tree, it sent him in. In to where, we knew exactly. The Plain of Growth.<br>
        Xytol, Tindias, and I approached the tree, marveling at it. We touched the trunk, and when we blinked, we were there…standing by the jungle…next to Kael. What in the name of Tunare? This wasn't supposed to happen! We entered the Plain of Growth, not Kael! What in the name of all things Holy?! We realized then that we were not of the right lvl to get in. The rumors were wrong…they lied. Tindias, Xytol, and I, Wabin, stood there for a moment, completely speechless. We looked at each other, while Iquredash spoke to us telepathically about how beautiful it was, and we each knew that our long journey had been for nothing. Absolutely useless.<br>
        Almost at the exact same time, the three of us looked at each other and said &quot;DAMNIT!&quot;<br>

Do you know of a way to contact Tindias at all, by chance?  He was my mentor in EQ...Even if he DID abdon being a Druid for a sissy bard.  ;)<br>

I talked to him afterward, and after all that happened. He told me that he DEleveled about 10 levels (I THINK he was 39 or 40 when we went on that journey, and when he left EQ he was like 31). He then told me that he didn't like EQ anymore, because of that for one thing and that he was going to leave. I have no idea how to get in touch with him anymore unless you play Diablo II and hopefully find someone named Tindias, if that's what he called himself.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm currently level 48. I haven't played EQ in a long time. Even though I get on these boards and wrote that story. I have been reading a lot of books recently. 4 and a half total, and I'm still not done yet. It'll probably be a while before I get back on EverQuest. Anyway, I'm in Mystical Avengers now, what guild are you in?
