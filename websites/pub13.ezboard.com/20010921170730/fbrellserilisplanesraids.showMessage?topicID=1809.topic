No way, you just continually buff just like any long raid such as fear or hate.  But other than that many of the dragons are similar to Vox/Naggy minus the Fear.  AEs are a bit stronger on some, some are very deadly.  Repop on all the dragons in WW are 2 hours except Klandicar (~3 days, Sleeper's Key dragon, now very nasty) and Sontalak (~24 hours, Sleeper's Key dragon, very nasty). <br>
<br>
Level 50 would be about minimum level.  But for a raid of 50+ with an average in the 54-55 range its very doable.  All descriptions below are for this type of raid of 24 people with an average in the 54/55 range.<br>
<br>
There are roaming dragons, nesting dragons, and guardian dragons.  <br>
<br>
Roaming dragons range from easy to very difficult.  Some are similiar to Naggy/Vox, others like Von have nasty AE's or proc's do 1200 dmg direct and then grav flux you for enough to fall for 10k if you don't have dmf up.<br>
<br>
Nesting dragons are the same.  From very easy to difficult.<br>
<br>
Guardian Dragons are those in the Temple of Veeshan scar and are some of the hardest ones in the zone.  Any of the Sapara's are alot more difficult than the rest. <br>
<br>
But you can easily spend hours in WW killing dragon after dragon and then kill them again after they repop.<br>
<br>
I HIGHLY recommend that everyone has at least 1 instant click buff item.  Either Jboots/Shaman Epic boots or a Shrunken Goblinskull Earring  or both.  By having that buff in your first buff slot it will generally get dispelled and you can click it to replace the buff. Stick a few junk buffs from slots 2-4 in case it skips the first buff. By doing this you will lose very few buffs.  If you have no instant click you will lose ALL your buffs EVERY fight.  That isn't really acceptable.  You will quickly be going buffless as the shaman and clerics will get really tired of buffing you after every fight all day long.  Go buy or camp jboots and goblin skull earring.  Tboots will NOT be acceptable.<br>
<br>
Resists are a big part too.  Minimum 100 FR/CR both at the same time UNbuffed.  Almost all dragons there have either FR or CR AE's.  Some have poison or disease but they can be avoided.  Few actually will fear.<br>
<br>
Here is a small list of the dragons, level, ae's, and talismans they drop. <br>
<br>
Amcilla  -  Level: 55  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Atpaev  -  Level: 51  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Cargalia  -  Level: ?  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell, Gravity Flux Proc,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Crial  -  Level: 57  Casts: AE Fire and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Derasinal  -  Level: 58  Casts: AE Fire, Dispell and Disease,   Drops a +6 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Escorpa of the Ring  -  Level: ?  Casts: ?,   Drops a +5 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Gafala  -  Level: 53  Casts: AE Fire and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Gangel  -  Level: ?  Casts: ?,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Harla Dar  -  Level: 63  Casts: AE Fear and Dispell,   Drops a +6 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Hechaeva  -  Level: 53  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Jen Sapara   -  Level: 61  Casts: Ice Comet,   Drops a +6 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Karkona   -  Level: 57  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +6 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Klandicar  -  Level: 63+  Casts: ?,   Drops a +7 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Mazi  -  Level: 54  Casts: AE Fire and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Nyga  -  Level: ?  Casts: ?,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Pantrilla  -  Level: &lt;54  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Vitaela  -  Level: 53  Casts: AE Cold and Dispell,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Vraptin  -  Level: ?  Casts: ?,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Yal  -  Level: 55  Casts: AE Fire and Dispel,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Yeldema  -  Level: 52  Casts: None,   Drops a +4 to stats/resists talisman<br>
Zil Sapara  -  Level: ?  Casts: ?,   Drops a +6 to stats/resists talisman<br>
<br>
<br>
 A &quot;+4 talisman&quot; as we call it is 5 AC 4 to all stats and resists  10 hp/mana  all/all  no drop.  There are +4, +5, +6, +7.  Each increase in + adds 1 to ac/stats/rests and 10 to hp/resists.  +7 talismans are sleepers key talismans and only come from Sontalak, Klandicar, Zlandicar, Yelinak, Lediniara the Keeper.  Lots of talismans will drop. Usually every other dragon has one.  I recommend making a master list of those wanting talismans and just doing a /random to find the winner each time.  Its so much easier than asking for names each time.  Just assign everyone numbers and go from there.  You can easily roll extra armor/spells that no one wants this way as well.<br>
<br>
Dragons will randomly drop Great Dragon Heads and Greater Dragon Heads.  These can be turned in to giants in Kael (with appropriate faction) for barbed dragonscale boots, frostbringer, cloak of the maelstrom, and barbed dragon scale pauldrons.   Dragons also drop various dragon hide armor of various qualities.  They also drop numerous spells.<br>
<br>
There are over 45 dragons in WW so you can easily have more than one raid at a time in the zone with plenty to kill.  Also there are tons of other mobs that you can pull and kill for xp during downtimes.  I'd recommend scouting the area to find some nice camp spots.  Also research the various dragons for their AEs, levels, etc.  Pulling the wrong dragon can quickly wipe out a raid very easily.  High level Druids and Bards are the best pullers in most cases since mobs like Velium Hounds can out run sow but they can't out run the high speed druid spell (form of hunter I believe) or Selo's.  Rangers and others can pull but from my experience a bard makes the best puller with a druid very close behind. <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">

<br>
Pretty decent map.  I like mine better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but its on Autocad and I can't post an image as easy.  Mine has exact loc's and other embedded info <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But anyway... The area marked &quot;safe spot&quot; on the map is ok if you are pulling the harder dragons from the scar (10-17) but for your raid you would rather take the nests (1-9) and the roamers in that area (avoid the Sapara's, Von, and Gargalia for a while, they are alot harder).  You can set up near 4500, -1500 which is just west of #9 but you will get some wanders in that area and there is very little room to move around without agroing things pathing nearby.  I prefer 3700, 3000 (right under the &quot;Western Wastes&quot; on the map).  HUGE area with very few to no wanders.  Gives people some room to move around and not be worried about pushing mobs off the edge into the water or into nearby mobs.  Very nice area.  Easy area to pull dragons 1, 2, 5-9 from.  Go get 3 &amp; 4 if you are moving fast enough.  BTW I'd suggest trying #9 first, Yeldema has no AE and is the easiest dragon there is.  He's the one that shaman can solo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'd avoid any of the scar dragons.  Most are alot harder than the others in WW.  Similar from going from Vox to Gorenaire in difficulty. <br>
<br>
There are three ways to get to that safe spot from the Siren's Grotto Tunnel.<br>
<br>
1) Invis everyone and follow the ocean to the west all the way around.  Bad way because invis will drop and people will get attacked and split up.<br>
<br>
2) Just fight your way there along the edge killing the wolves and wurms along the way.  Just keep everyone together.  You will have to kill Yeldema once you get to the #9 area and then kill Hachaeva (#5) before you can move on.  Neither see invis but 95% of the time someone loses invis and the raid gets wiped by getting attacked without being ready.<br>
<br>
3)  Run yourself and a magician to the safe spot while invis and sow'd.  Easy with just two of you to get there while invis.  Then gate back and CoH everyone.<br>
<br>
I prefer #2.<br>
<br>
BTW very few dragons see invis.  There is one wurm named Mraaka (level 63 and tough) that sees invis.  He's a bitch, usually kills one of us while we run to ToV for raids. <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">

Bard makes the best puller since he can out run anything easy.  Also can track and invis very easily. Most of the dragons outside of the scar don't see invis other than Mraaka, who looks like a wurm and always surprises you.<br>
<br>
<br>
That size raid is fine Minute.  You should be able to take any of the nesting dragons (1-9) and a few roamers.  Just don't pull any of the scar dragons, any of the Sapara's, Von, Cargalia, or Mraaka and you should be fine. <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">

Lower level clerics I recommend some decent mr, and you will want to have some buffage.  I tend to go with group buffs to be honest.  Group hero group naltron suffices perfectly well and easier to rebuff when everyone gets dispelled.<br>
<br>
Yes it does take some coordination, but at the same time the lower levels 50's need to learn how to pay attention and work together to be able to take on higher end mobs.  It can also be kinda fun moving from nest to nest along the coast line.  Those used to fear raids should be used to that.<br>

Didn't realize that.  Jaradis is KoS to CoV so I couldn't tell.  And Twiggie runs around while using Improved Sup Camo so I never noticed since the only things that can see me are on CoV.  I didn't realize they changed it.  I got killed by a wyvern awhile back and just figured they were like the mobs in skyfire.  Even though I was amiable to ring of scale the skyfire mobs (minions of scale) still hated me. <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">

We go there just about every other week with as few as 3 groups and do just fine.  We usually invis and run along the coast till we are just across from Yeldema and pull that group of dragons, Hecheva, yeldema, mazi etc.  Usual raid stuff applies (55+ Shaman for slows etc.).  It is a really fun area to hunt and that area near Yesldema dosen't usually get too many wanderers. <p>Chorak<BR>

<br>
When you are taking people that have never been to WW to hunt dragons 4-5 groups is fine.  I'm sure Clan could do Hate/Fear with 3 groups as well but do you?  Nope.   2-3 solid groups of those knowing what to do and 1-2 more groups of dragon raid newbies so they can learn.<br>
<br>
A 4-5 group raid would be slaughtered by Sontalak and Klandicar in under a minute, Sonta and Klandi are that tough (Von, Cargalia, and the Sapara's would be a rough fight but possible.).  Unresistable AEs will wipe you out fast if you don't have a ton of firepower to drop him quick.<br>
<br>
To give you an idea how tough they are:<br>
<br>
Sontalak: melees for 425 dmg, Flurries, AE pillage (removes 4 buffs),  procs Char (700 DD),  AE DD (up to 650 dmg / debuffs 1 buff)  AE Fear. Unslowable.   He AE's every ~12 seconds (both AEs)   <br>
<br>
Klandicar v2.0: melees for 540+ dmg, Rampages, AE DD (400 dmg LURE based, dispells 1 buff) every 12 seconds, AE Fears, Unslowable. <br>
<br>
Their AE range is huge, approx 300 ft from what I could tell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any other questions Minute. <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">

Most of the nesters don't from what I remember.  They really aren't the problem since the puller can quickly go tag them and pull them back to the group easily.  Its the roamers that gate that will cause problems.  Usually they will gate halfway across the zone.<br>
<br>
With the crew you want to take I would recommend just parking at the camp spot and not moving.  Moving around will get alot of high level adds and really isn't worth it.  You just need to learn which ones to sieve and which ones you don't.  <br>
<br>
Under level 50 is possible but I'd be cautious.  They will take massive damage from the AE's because of their level they won't be able to resist it nearly as well.  At level 57 with 250+ FR/CR at the same time I get hit more than I resist, usually for small amounts but still get hit.   <p><A HREF="http://www.silentredemption.org/" TARGET="_new">
