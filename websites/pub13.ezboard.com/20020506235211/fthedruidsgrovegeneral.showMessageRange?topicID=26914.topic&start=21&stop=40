Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> Well Sobe, I must admit I feel kinda odd replying to this...  there are so many that have more experience being a druid, and pay more attention to the numbers, mechanics, coding, et al than I do.  I just play to have fun and don't really care one way or another how the numbers work.  Anyway, to answer your questions.<br>
<br>
I began playing EQ Christmas day, 2000.  My first character was an Erudite mage, leveled him to 27 with a bunch of RL friends who played a rogue, warrior and cleric.  The four of us did pretty good for ourselves, until the cleric took a vacation, the warrior finally got around to quitting the game, and the rogue shot up into the 40's seemingly overnight.  Left to my own devices, I gave up the mage and started my druid.  Gupwin is now lvl 53, has his epic (which I agree is broken), and is rarely played anymore, unless my wife (lvl 51 enchanter) wants his company.  He's still my &quot;main&quot; as friends often call for him to come exp hunt with them, but they're really the only reason that I still play him, as I can't seem to find a group anywhere, and soloing sucks rocks...  it's boring.  I play this game for the companionship, for the fun of hanging out with friends and other players, and I seldom get to do that with my druid anymore.  My druid was given some things, and I recieved some things in trades in EC that were all rogue useable, so I started a rogue, and I love him.  Hanthar is lvl 44 and moving up the ranks.  He's almost as twinked as they come, but I've taken the time to read the safehouse, and ask questions, and have avoided powerleveling him so that I could play the class well (the same thing I did when I started the druid).  I only have one account for myself, so Gupwin has never been used to powerlevel another of my characters.  <br>
<br>
As far as reasons for playing the rogue almost exclusively, frankly, the druid end game is fubar.  I don't know how anyone get's a druid to 60 and has fun at the same time.  I can handle soloing for short stints, but I hate it enough that I have roughly 72 days played on Gupwin, and he's still lvl 53, and only a bub and a half into 53 at that.  Hanthar has around 18 days played and is lvl 44.  I now also have a monk twink that is played for quiet time from everyone...  he's unguilded and will likely remain so.  Again, he was started cause I had stuff for a monk.  I also recreated my magician and dropped a bunch of stuff on him that I had collected and couldn't sell.  I have been considering shelving my druid in favor of my rogue, however, simply because he's more useful in most circumstances than my druid is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough rambling.  I hope this answers your questions sufficiently.<br>

Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> I didn't &quot;change&quot; class exactly, but I don't play the druid anywhere near as much compared to the twinks such as a monk.<br>
<br>
The reason being, as a druid I had a hard time finding groups.  I was out of the game for a bit, guild split up, friends moved on etc... which leaves pickup groups... and you know what pickup groups usually think of druids for whatever reasons.<br>
I've seen it as partly due to The Reputation, and partly due to the fact we aren't as useful in most groups as other classes tend to be.<br>
<br>
Soloing was ok for a while, but it got *very* old at 35 or so when it consists of spending 10 minutes sitting down watching a mob getting slowly rotted, regaining mana, rinse, repeat.  Or with quadding, 5 minutes of action and 10 minutes downtime watching the mana bar.  I don't log onto EQ to read novels, I log on to play <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In summary, the problems I had - groups:not really wanted.  Solo:far too much downtime. <p>-- <br>

<i>Please list your main class now, any reasons of which you felt you needed to change your class. Basically why did you change from a Druid to your class you are using now. If things were changed (improved) would you come back? IE: Did you like being a Druid?</i><br>
<br>
60 shaman, 60 druid. Shamans have no problem in the soloing department, and they have some of nice things druids can do, but as you know, slow > all. Shamans are wanted by melees in xp groups for buffs and slow--healing, too. Shamans are also wanted for raids, even more so now for disease/poison resists on top of all their slows. <br>
<br>
If things changed, yes, I'd play a druid 100% exclusively as before, but I also am very realistic about VI improving things because they want players to invest in as many characters as possible, and it just turned out that shamans become increasingly godly in the endgame. However, the druid's versatility is practically unmatched by another class except bards, and I still enjoying playing her for xp groups and some raids (raids mostly on hard melee mobs).<br>

My reason, as a druid I am seeing that I am worthless in the higher end of the game. And I havent really gotten there yet. I cant heal that great anymore, crossing my fingers everytime praying that my heals will keep some of my party memeber alive till that cleric can get to them. I DS and port and thats about it. I used to think it was just me, worked hard to get my wisdom to 221 (didnt buy that all that gear either) so that I could have more mana and I am now realizing even with 500 wisdom I still wont be able to be an asset. I no longer feel like a viable group member. Oh wait I can sow but since most of the high end is inside dungeons I cant. It's disgusting when your a druid and you wondering if you should get Jboots till you can get those 3 points into inate run speed. It is just sad. So guess my Rouge will soon become my new main until somebody figures out how to make us better at the high end.<br>

<br>
Then on a fear raid that I lost half a level breaking, and lost a roll on the only vermic tunic to drop to a druid that hadn't been in on the break I kinda snapped and shelved the druid.<br>

I wouldn't switch back to druid.  I simply enjoy doing crowd control too much.  Even when I play the druid I find myself snaring and root parking for crowd control, but the enchanter's crowd control tool box is so much bigger. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=15 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td align=right><b><FONT face="Zapf-Chancery, Chancery, cursive" size=4>Farghen Oom</font></b><br>Senior Gnome of<br><b><a href="http://www.forsakenrealm.org/"><font face="impact" size=4 color="#000000">Forsaken Realm</font></a></b><br>Mithaniel Marr<br><i>si non confectus, non reficiat</i><td align="left"><img src="http://209.61.201.173/eq/me75.jpg" width=320 height=132></td></tr></td></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upanamah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Panamah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(3/31/02 7:47:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26914.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://nmcs.com/kingscourt/images/panamah.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Druids Please Respond...

Got bored with the cleric  and started a rogue.  60 Rogue is my main.  But I still play the other two... at the same time in fact.   The druid crept up the levels, mostly unnoticed, during the process of powerleveling my rogue.<br>
<br>
In fact,  I think playing multiple characters at once probably saved me from dumping this game long ago.  It's a ton of fun.  Working on #4, a shaman. My best buddy in the game plays an enchanter and warrior (both 60).<br>
<br>
But I really did quit playing my druid very reluctantly.  She was a lot of fun, but there was massive overcrowding of druids at that level, at that time.  <br>
<br>
Funny, druids are definitely underrepresented in our guild now.

Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> "1. Change their class from a Druid to another character/class."<br>
<br>
I fit into this category.  I started a warrior on prexus the day it came up and after a month of playing time, i hit a wall.  I was new to morpg and started looking for an alternative to a warrior.  So i choose a druid for their solo ability, sow and heal.<br>
<br>
I gained levels as a druid and hit another road block.  The class was not as desireable in a group and that is where i was interested in being.  I enjoy high intensity play where a group operates as a unit to overcome slim odds through each person's ability rather than to exp grind completely safe areas doing the same thing repeatly.<br>
<br>
This is where i made a another warrior but on tribunal.  It started out as a labor of love and then as i developed cleric friends, my sense of being needed in a group grew until post kunark where i saw druids falling behind with every expansion.<br>
<br>
here is an itemized list of ways we were ignored:<br>
1. kunark equip sucks... but there is better now.<br>
<br>
2. hit points of mobs started to grow a lot and equip did not keep up.  1 bar of mana = 1 complete heal on a warrior tanking an unslowed mob.<br>
<br>
3. druids became port b*tches in sov.  We could sow/port/invis/succor and navigate zones.  Yes we can heal but at the cost of a full mana bar with little return.<br>
<br>
4. our equip suxs compared to the classes Versus need for us on raids.  Druids get much nicer ac/hp/resists now but our spells have really lagged behind.<br>
<br>
5. focusing on spells, we need an important spell that is hinged on raids for us to be considered important on raids and the spells has to be used at multiple times during the raid.  Complete heal or some  bulk heal can fill this gap.<br>
<br>
6. wizards started to get massive nukes.  I dont consider druids nukers due to our priest classification but wizards started out out pace us in grand ways.<br>
<br>
Summary:  Druids need a niche.  Not nessarily a class defining trait but a niche to allow us to keep melee alive on raids.  There are so many damage dealing classes that the offensive aspect should not be emphized.<br>
<br>
PS a key debuff would be nice as well.  debuffs that allow melee to hit or hit better OR better resist debuffs.  Still, this is one spell casted once.... unless a whole zone has mobs that require this spell.  Also, a da/db or escape spell that removes us from the hate list would be nice as well.<br>
<br>
My main is a warrior.  I would not come back to a druid due to my friends i have made as being a warrior.  I loved being a druid. <p><CENTER>

<br>
first:  52 druid<br>
second:  59 enchanter<br>
third:  48 warrior<br>
<br>
changed to chanter because he was infinitely more valuable to my guild than one more druid.... hell, would have been more valuable even if we had had no druids.<br>
<br>
changed to the warrior because to be 100% honest melee classes are obscenely overpowered today.  and i want some of that.<br>
<br>
i will not return to the druid until we get ports to luclin and the ability to snare / root all green mobs.  period.  without snare a druid is dead, and without ports i wont get there in the first place... if im gonna take a spire im gonna take a char who can do something coen im there.<br>
<br>
i will stick with the enchanter til he gets KEI, then i will move permanently to the warrior.<br>
<br>
no non melee class is even in the same category as melees in todays version of &quot;class balance&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unidosplainswalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nidos Plainswalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/1/02 2:20:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26914.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gsarchives.com/psx/sprites/MarvelvsCapcom/Strider_breath.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: mine</span><hr size=1> I quit my druid and started up a bard.<br>
<br>
I think I would be a lot happer about my class if I didn't feel I had this awful stigma around me.  The whole dr00d lamer dr00ds are the best class so dont complain thing.  I had no intention of being one of the most common things you see around, and it kind of bothers me.<br>
<br>
I think its good that druids have a lot of varied spells.  However, the way I see it, well, what's better?  1 bucket of gold or 6 buckets of broken nails?  The only time (even at my level) I feel like I'm truly doing my part is when I can use all of my skills at the same time.  Unfortunately, my mana doesnt agree with me, so a lot of the time i'm just sitting there medding after like 1 nuke and some buffs.  In other words, I think the only way to take advantage of many sub par skills is to use all of them.  Giving out buffs, nuking, dotting, healing, every fight.  Not a lot of each, just... some.  Something to contribute.<br>
<br>
I didn't start a bard for much any other reason than I thought I'd be good at it and they have many skills as well (and bring them to bear every single fight). <p><CENTER>

Who is my main? For raid purposes it is Xorena (60 cleric) but in all honesty I like my druid better. I have more fun with my druid, I just feel impotent on raids.

I love playing her, it just isn't helpful to the guild for Kinare to be my main. If I didn't play my cleric, we wouldn't have raids most of the time (very small guild). I don't see how they can improve things, but they can sure try. <p><center>

Thankfully, Firiona Vie opened up, and I started a cleric and couldn't be happier.  Logged on my druid one day on the old server, /boggled at the sheer amount of ooc and shouted gibberish, and have not been back since.  Even if I had not left that server, I am almost certain I wouldn't be playing a druid any more.

I play many different characters.  Warrior, Rogue, Wizard, Pally, Ranger, Cleric, and Necro.  I am one of those people that would never PL my alts.  2 boxing and all that is pretty silly, IMO.  I'm not even going to use my twink gear until after lvl 10....even then my gear isn't UBER.  It's no fun playing the game with no challenge.  I never understood why people even bother. <br>
<br>
The only reason I ever started other characters is because I was sick of selling great items for dirt cheap.  I created twinks just in case I ever &quot;finish&quot; with my druid.  I am currently playing a warrior off and on, but I can never see him as being my main.  I don't have the time to really put into him because I my druid is always needed for raids.  *shrug*  I just want to try something different once in awhile.  After playing a druid for 3 years, it's only natural to want something new.<br>
<br>
How many people have dropped thier main and simply became ANY other class?  I'd bet anything that the numbers would be similar to the response you're hoping to generate here.<br>

Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> I first hit 60 with my druid shortly after Velious came out, and druids really didn't have a niche they could call their own.  Felt more like dead-weight rather then a contribution to large raids.  Translocates were not introduced into the game yet so more often then naught I was the one who had to bind outside in ww near DN or ToV to ferry people for hours and hours on.  This was back then when many things in ww didn't use CoV faction and I got myself into a pretty bad death loop times a few times.  That + the 3 minute corpse rotting on a empty corpse didn't help either.  Nukes wouldn't land either and the classes we were always short on were clerics.<br>
<br>
Eventually I got tired of this and took over a cleric from a friend who didn't play anymore.  At first I tried playing her by herself, but that role was very lacking.  No real versatility and often just sitting down medding most of the time.  Eventually I bought a second computer and started primary'ing my druid again and 2nd boxing the cleric.  Things were fun again, and I mastered many of the nuisances of multi-playing, though moving 2 characters when they are in different groups is always a pain.<br>
<br>
More importantly, it allowed me to take more risks just because I had a cleric safety net for rez's.<br>
<br>
I pretty much switched mains from druid to cleric for a brief period of time, about 4 months, and then switched by to my druid.  Though I could argue that I never switched mains at all, as more and more changes were being made to the game that made druids a little more fun to play again.<br>
<br>
If I didn't multi-play, I'd have to say that given a choice, I would have to main my cleric for overall utility and effectiveness to help the guild, but then I would probably be a lot more bitter =) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=142925>~Aerillea Mystfyre~</a>

Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> I have a similar tale to tell about my Druids' retirement.  It all began with the Kunark beta.  I had a friend in the Beta, and had access to view the spdat's as they were released.<br>
<br>
Let me say that my first impression of the Kunark SPDAT had me extremely disappointed.  As soon as I saw it, in fact, I decided that the Druid class was dead -- as many people know who played a Druid before Kunark, Druids low-levels life cycle was kind of cyclical.  At a given level we were 80% one class, and 50% of the other two -- and those were Healer, Nuker, DoTer, respectively.  Kunark changed all that.  We became less than 50% of each of the three, and never had any strengths at all.<br>
<br>
So, shortly before Kunark came out, I created my Enchanter.  My Enchanter was around level 48 or so when Kunark was finally released, and officially my new &quot;main&quot;.<br>
<br>
Looking back, I was 100% correct.  The druids' problem (as I currently see it) is that we are very weak compared to ALL THREE of the &quot;pure&quot; classes we imitate -- Clerics, Wizards, and Necro/Sham (DoT).<br>
<br>
Anyways, the Druid is now my Enchanter's &quot;Personal Healer&quot; and &quot;TP Bish&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udreadstar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dreadstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/1/02 7:47:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26914.topic&index=42>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Old Druids Please Respond... Twink Druids Too!</span><hr size=1> Started a Human Ranger on the Luclin server a month after Luclin came online.<br>
Played him to the mid 40's.  I loved the class, but at that time it seemed very broken with the hybrid exp penalty, low hps, agro, low ac... <br>
<br>
Decided I wanted to play a character that would be fun, that could solo, and group and be effective.  Which is my Druid...  Got my druid up to 50ish, and they made some changes to the Ranger, and went back and played him for a while.  Got him to 51 and started to notice they still were having issues... <br>
<br>
Then thought, I wanted to play a *needed* class (ie:  Warrior, Cleric, or chanter), so not to screw up.  I chose a warrior, after giving most of my ranger stuff to my warrior, I shot him up to 48 very quickly.  Was in dire need for a change, so I quit EQ and went to AO (yup.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) didn't play it for too long, quit and stayed away from gaming for a while.  DAoC came out and really enjoyed a lot of the differences, but still missed something about EQ.  Got my healer to 50, and got bored.  <br>
<br>
I logged back on (6  months later) with my Druid again to group with a friend just to see if I would enjoy it. Got the last 3 blue bubbles and dinged to 55.  And had a blast, but felt like something is missing. Taking the stuff off my warrior, I gave it to a newly created monk and shot him up to 21.  <br>
<br>
I had a RL friend who played a 53ish monk on Luclin, start a new character he went with a pally and I went with a chanter.  Now we just play those two chars when we both are on.<br>
<br>
I've thought about paying for another account and splitting my chars so it would make life easier.  Like move the Druid to a separate account for pling, or porting, or whatever...  But I don't really have a second machine that I can use except for a laptop...<br>
<br>
I love the flexibility of the druid, and really in a way I feel useful, but I feel like they are missing something...<br>
