Her arms were wrapped around her knees, and she was gently rocking back and forth, staring at nothing in particular towards the horizon before her.<br>
<br>
She was alone this time of day, almost dawn. The sky was still a blue hue with the promise of a sunrise in the near future. A perfectly round moon still clung to it's throne in the sky, fighting a losing battle with the sun's approach. A few bright stars still remained, though they too were fading fast.<br>
<br>
Her blonde hair flicked wildly as the wind assaulted the beach, blowing sprays of water at her face. The salty taste of the ocean reminded her of the tears that were slowly building up in her eyes.<br>
<br>
She remembered the songs she used to sing, the songs about her constant companion, Fenye, Tanari, Ambridahl, and many, many others. Though Fenye and Tanari were by far more hardy adventurers, she had gone to several far off lands - and even the planes of Hate and Fear - with them. But they were all gone now, and so was her willingness to sing. <br>
<br>
The sun peeked over the horizon, and cast a long, distorted mirror of itself across the seas of the Timorous Deep. She saw a tiny spec slowly bobbing up and down each rolling wave, heading further and further out to the ocean. It was her lute. <br>
She placed a rose that Ambridahl had once given her inside the body of the lute and set it adrift, much like the feelings she had inside her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know, giving up your lute means quite a bit to the bards around this world.&quot; said a voice from behind her. She whirled to meet the voice, but found noone. She didn't even feel like singing a ballad that would enable her to see the invisible speaker.<br>
&quot;Who are you? Where are you?&quot; she quavered, hoping to locate the direction of her new acquaintance.<br>
&quot;I'm everywhere, Llannu. I'm the wind that blows through the trees, I'm the leaves that fall to the earth, I'm the water that nurishes the plants, I'm the spirit in the animals, I'm the life in the elves.&quot; the voice spoke again, with a melodic harmony to each word.<br>
Astonished, Llannu thought she knew who was speaking to her, but before she could speak, the voice was heard again.<br>
&quot;My dear daughter, you have a darkness to you that is unfitting to your joyful nature. I've seen you grow from a wild erratic young elf to a beautiful and talented bard. I've been sensing this disturbance in you for quite some time, Llannu, and you know the dangers of harnessing those feelings inside you.&quot; The voice was talking about the elven nature. Elves were not like humans in the sense that they &quot;felt&quot; each other. An elf would know another familiar elf was nearby even if they did not see each other yet. And the elves used these abilities to see what is in each other's hearts, wether love, distress, joy or even sometimes sadness. Holding feelings of guilt, disorder, and sorrow for extended periods of time was dangerous in the sense that the elf could possibly lose the ability to &quot;feel&quot; the other elves, thus becoming separated and dormant to his or her own community. It was like being in exile in your own home.<br>
&quot;Yes.. I am sad for many reasons. I.. we.. no, I don't know what happened, but I'm alone now. I've never been alone..&quot;<br>
Llannu instantly felt the warm, soothing motherly embrace around her, but it was not enough to calm her feelings. <br>
&quot;My dear, there really is too much strife amongst you. You have thrown your most favorite possession to the creatures of the sea, without hope of ever recovering it. You used to have such a beautiful voice, but the only sounds I feel from you are the ones a lonely siren sings at the moon.&quot;<br>
&quot;Then why did you try to come cheer me up if there is no hope?&quot;<br>
&quot;Llannu, there is always hope, although, not in this life. I did not come to cheer you up, but rather take you away from your pain. Your companions, say thier names for me.&quot;<br>
&quot;Fenye.. and Tanari.. and Ambridahl.. and Tilana.. Werane..&quot;<br>
&quot;It brings you pain to speak thier names, does it not?&quot;<br>
&quot;yes..&quot;<br>
&quot;What is your happiest moment of your time knowing them?&quot;<br>
&quot;When.. when I was young. We all were together. We laughed, and played, and I was really happy then. Fenye is dead.. Tanari and Ambridahl has forgotten and left me, Tilana .. and Werane.. I haven't seen them in forever. I don't know where they went or even if they are still alive.&quot;<br>
&quot;Focus on your times of joy, Llannu.&quot;<br>
&quot;yes.. sorry. I remember when I was very young, after Fenye married Tanari, I remember being with them to celebrate. I.. I just want things to be like they were so long ago. But I can't change that, I can't.&quot;<br>
&quot;Llannu, if you truly believe that you no longer wish to be of this world of mortals, then take my hand. Sing your songs of joy and happiness for me, and come return home with your Mother.&quot;<br>
A small tear rolled down Llannu's cheek. She knew if she accepted Tunare's offer, it would mean she would leave this world forever. She would become a living spirit in the home of Tunare. Slowly, she reached out her hand, and started to cry as she remembered the times she was happiest. Though they will never return, at least her future would be as calm as the seas behind her.<br>
A soft, luminiscent glow surrounded her as she felt her spirit pass through her clothes and out of her body. It was then that she saw the Mother in all her radiance and beauty, every aspect of a perfect body. <br>
She still could not bring herself to sing, and as she faded from the world of the living, she was reminded of some words Fenye had spoken to her long ago, before so many changes happened.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We are here for a short time compared to the eternity we spend in our afterlives. Those you come to know in the world, make the best of it, for it will be those you love that make your stay here a livable experience. Without them, there is no point to life at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*And with that.. I will no longer post here, nor log onto Brell. It was nice knowing many of you, and though I wish things were different for me, it hurts me too much to see how things are now. I hope everyone who reads this will think different of how they treat other people. I've certainly learned alot these past two years, but if I had a chance to go back and do it all over again, and experience every ounce of sorrow I've felt, I would most certainly do it. Knowing someone for the first time, to experience first love, and to have someone by your side and in your heart was the greatest feeling I have ever had in my life. But all things do come to an end at some point, but the most important thing I learned at the end, was that sometimes you try to bring back the past, or the feelings from the past, and that can never be. I tried too hard to make things like they used to be, and it has caused me terrible hurt that I thought I would never endure in my lifetime. <br>
<br>
I started with nothing, and I am left with nothing. The only things that have changed now are the memories.* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucoquetta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coquetta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/24/01 5:26:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=368.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Calm Seas</span><hr size=1> Absolutely beautiful.<br>

You're yet another of the people I'll never get the chance to meet. Though I do not know you, I am sad to see you go.<br>
<br>
I understand where you're coming from though, and that you have your reasons. I wish you luck in whatever the road ahead holds for you. Leaving Norrath though? /sigh<br>
