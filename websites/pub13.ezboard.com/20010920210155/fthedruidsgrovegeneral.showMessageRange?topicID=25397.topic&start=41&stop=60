I'm sorry, but I just don't see it.  Unless things drastically change when you get to level 60 as far as loot goes, I don't know what everyone is complaining about.<br>
<br>
At my current level (36), there are very few things I WANT that I can even get myself.  All of us are constantly trying to upgrade our equipment, and as a result most of us have bought stuff that we ourselves aren't even high enough level to attain on our own. (or at least not without a full group or more)  So, basically, by the time I get high enough level to kill the mobs that drop the loot I wanted 10 levels before, I don't want or need what they have and chances are, it's not worth nearly as much as I paid for it anyway.<br>
<br>
Basically, what I'm saying is...at level 60 you probably have MUCH better stuff than anything you could loot off a green or do a low level quest to attain.  On the off chance there is something that you really want that can only be looted from a green mob, then where is the harm in having to buy it for a change?  The only reason I see someone at level 60 wanting this stuff is to twink an alternate.  I don't see anything wrong with having to buy the stuff from lower level people to twink another character of yours...heck, most people do that anyway because it's faster and most of the stuff you want is very affordable.  You'll still be able to farm stuff in all the current zones (except the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains of course) and sell them for a profit to be able to buy stuff from the zones with the WLC.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just don't see people level 55+ or whatever missing out on anything.  How often do you see people drooling over a drop that came from the Warrens?  Verant knows that if they put stuff that high level people really want on mobs they can't get loot from, they will get flamed beyond belief.  They know the player base is slowly rising to high levels.  I have a feeling that there won't be much decent loot at all in SoL on any mobs that aren't blue to level 55+, but I could be wrong.<br>

<br>
if you honestly think coding is going to stop farmers, you're naive.  it's as simple as dragging along your twink and doing it, which will certainly happen.<br>
<br>
and as far as getting those items through auction...ya, if i sat in the auction zone for lengthy periods of time, i could eventually get most of that stuff...but why should anyone be forced to?  and what you're doing there is making people spend cash on anything they want, albeit for themselves, their alts, friends, guildies or whatever....then you're directly encouraging farming in zones where they can so that they can make enough cash to buy them.  and many guilds are set up so that when you get an upgrade to an armor piece, you are expected to pass down the piece you were using to someone else who coulduse it in the guild, as well as the fact that you're raiding most of the time.  where is all this cash to buy things supposed to come from?<br>
<br>
you can't say "you should have to buy stuff" and "you shouldn't ever be able to farm anything" in the same sentance, because it just doesn't work.  that cash flow has to come from somewhere, and unfortuneately, Verrant puts very nice items sometimes on lower level MOBs.<br>
<br>
why the hell would i pay 5-6k for a gobby skull earring when i can go get one myself?<br>
<br>
how is someone supposed to save up all this money to buy things if they get a bad rep if they kill anything that's green?<br>
<br>
how many of you here feel camping bilge is wrong?  he's certainly VERY green...and yet he drops VERY NICE loot.  who here would honestly not try to kill him if you saw him walking by?<br>
<br>
NO ONE<br>
<br>
is this "farming"?  by your definitions, yes.  but if you let him walk by you and don't take a whack, then you're foolish.<br>
<br>
anyone here ever done your epic?  how many MOBs were green?  <br>
<br>
and what happens when you're in a mixed group helping someone with an important item they need, and as you lay the final smack on the MOB, you see the lovely trivial code.<br>
<br>
"oh, sorry man...was green to me but not to you since you're 3 levels lower.  good luck camping him for another 5 days."<br>
<br>
<br>
and on another note, i didn't drag farming loot into this to the extent some of you pro-coders did.  i simply said that i want to be able to explore, solve new quests, discover new gear.  not farm the same MOB over and over and sell it to lower levels for buttloads of cash.  that is not my perogative.  just to be able to make a nice sweep over the whole new expansion and see what's there...not having to go through 7 zones and finding one where i'm "allowed" to hunt. <p><img src=http://braidfreak.homestead.com/Files/mylogo.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ualdarionshard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aldarion Shard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/26/01 11:47:50 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/27/2062827.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stonebrunt Mountains</span><hr size=1> ya know im very pro TLC but that statement does catch me, for a second, braid.  having to go over 7 zones until you can find where youa re allowed to hunt.  ugh, thats not what being a druid is about.<br>

&quot;actually, all the things i listed come from green MOBs...with the occassional othmir warrior being blue.&quot;<br>
<br>
when I *specifically* went out of my way to point out that several items you listed were blue at 60.  Let me reiterate:<br>
<br>
Gauntlets of the Black - obtained from a blue Firebrand the Black upon trigger of 8th ring<br>
Dark Ember - obtained from a blue Firebrand the Black upon trigger of 8th ring<br>
Crustacean Shell Armor - obtained from othmirs, some of which are blue at 60<br>
Frozen Orb - obtained from Scarbrow who is blue at 60 upon trigger for 5th ring<br>
Golden Efreeti Boots - obtained from Efreeti Lord Djarn who is blue at 60<br>
<br>
I have *personally* killed and looted Gauntlets of the Black, Dark Ember and Golden Efreeti Boots and gotten xp for it.  I have also killed Scarbrow who was blue and gave me xp, though this was after they changed the frozen orb to be a rare drop, so I did not get a chance to loot it.<br>
<br>
In addition, to poke more holes in your statement (not that there aren't a lot already):<br>
Cane of the Tranquil off Necrosis Scarab who is blue to a 60<br>
Brown Chitin Spider comes from Stone Spider which is sometimes blue to a 60, and even if not, usually still gives xp (if killed solo)<br>
<br>
Really, when the first statement you make is not even close to being true, you lose a lot of credibility.  And given your willingness to toss around incorrect generalities, I don't think it would be useful to even discuss your other points.<br>

i would have to be a member of the &quot;anti-code&quot; side.  i prefer to hunt for my items, not pay someone else for what i could kill myself.  some people get pride by finding a really great deal and making good trades, others get that pride from knowing it was their own blood shed to get the gear.  doesnt make one side or the other better, just different views.<br>
<br>
but geez, if you are planning to quit when you hit 60, then why bother making the trek there?  go ahead and quit now, save yourself a whole lot of time rather than working towards something you obviously dont appreciate or understand.  this isnt like the game Life, for tunares sake.  there is no finish line here. <p>-K<br>

"actually, all the things i listed come from green MOBs...with the occassional othmir warrior being blue."<br>
<br>
when I *specifically* went out of my way to point out that several items you listed were blue at 60. Let me reiterate:"<br>
<br>
i'm sorry too, but your information is not correct.  at 60, pretty much everything i listed is in fact, green.  i was wrong on the efreeti lord, but it's been a while.<br>
<br>
your counter-attacks talks about MOBs not in their normal mode (scarbrow and firbrand have always been green to me, and while they may or may not be blue during triggered rings quests, that holds little difference to me, because if someone is running their ring quests, i'm not going to kill the MOBs they spawned because they're finally not trivial, and on top of that, how often are they trigger?  rarely.  so that whole angle of yours doesn't work.)  and i stated already that othmir warriors were "sometimes" blue, but mostly green.  <br>
<br>
why the knitpicking?  you get my point.  there's a lot of gear out there that's good and still drops off of "trivial" MOBs.  maybe you just like getting the last word in or something, but your "poking holes" doesn't add anything to this topic or make any difference.  my point still remains, good gear drops off green MOBs, and i shoudnn't be obligated to buy it.<br>
<br>
how much are you willing to bet 90% of the MOBs in SoL will aggro regardless of level difference?  it's all backwards. <p><img src=http://braidfreak.homestead.com/Files/mylogo.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urolemeggido.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Role Meggido</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/27/01 1:43:42 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stonebrunt Mountains</span><hr size=1> I honestly don't see the point of adding many new level 1 - 35 zones.  <br>
<br>
The entire old world is full of them.  On my server many of them continuously sit empty.  Meanwhile level 35 and 45 + zones are completely full for the most part.<br>
<br>
I do not at all see why it would not be more practical to reitemize the lower level zones for those 35 &lt; and add new upper level content.<br>
<br>
I understand the idea behind loot coding, but I think it practically works out to be dopey.  The point of gaining levels is so that I can kill weaker things easier.   It also effectively reduces the content that people have access too.  <br>
<br>
I hope that some of these decisions are reversed to be pragmatic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usilleyeskimo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SilleyEskimo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/27/01 5:21:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My viewpoint on TLC</span><hr size=1> I have actually been lurking the Grove for over a week, but this topic of TLC has really gotten me concerned.<br>
<br>
I am 100% against the code.  I would even go as far as to say, my purchase of SOL is in question.  I LOVE EverQuest, but this code disrupts everything I have worked for in the past 2+ years.  It is a step backwards and causes many more problems than it solves.<br>
<br>
One of my most anticipated things about SOL is the addition of focus items.  I can only imagine that the vast majority of these new weapons and gear will be on greens.  To be forced into buying these upgrades via the Loot Code, is unforgivable.  The majority of players are being punished by the actions of a small section of the player populace that camp and sell.  That's what this code is after all.....a punishment.  Well, I am upset for being pusnished for something I didn't do.  I do not want to build another character for the sole purpose of gaining a lvl 36 focus item for my level 48 druid as some people have suggested.  I want to walk in, cast 4 spells, get my item, and be done with it.  It should be that way because that is something I have worked for.  If the MoB were camped by other people, I would go elsewhere, just like I do now.  <br>
<br>
What's to stop the TRUE greif players and jerks in EQ from using this code to piss people off?  I lvl 60 jerk can still PK a rare MoB and prevent the &quot;proper leveled character&quot; from obtaining the item.  This code does nothing but cause problems for the good players, and gives more loopholes for the bad ones.<br>
<br>
In reguards to finding the &quot;proper&quot; place to hunt....I couldn't agree more!  Imagine if the Tower of Frozen Shadow had the TLC code.  Who would want to spend 8+ hours trying to figure out the key spawns and what-not, only to get to the top floor and find....GREENS!  All that work for what?  Absolutely nothing, because you didn't know the highest level would be green.  A group of players would walk out with a wasted day and not a piece of loot to show for thier troubles.  BTW, that lower level loot is what alot of players make plat from to buy higher level gear.  The whole argument that high level players can and should be reduced to buying is completely screwed by the fact that our most common form of income IS LOWER LEVEL LOOT.  When SOL is released, the items from the new expansion will be the most sought after loot in the game.  Prices will skyrocket, then level off after about a month or so.  During that time, the majority of the itmes and money will be unavailable to the high level players.  I am paying the same amount as a low level player to purchase the expansion, as well as play on a month to month basis.  I feel like this would be taking away a great deal from my personal playing experiance.  I don't have a lowbie twink, nor do I desire one at this stage in the game.<br>
<br>
I do realize what VI is trying to accomplish, but this just isn't a solution in my eyes.  As a matter of fact, I really don't see high levels in lowbie zones as a large enough problem to warrent all the trouble of extra coding and what-not.  I sincerely hope they reconsider this approach.<br>

<br>
Oh well, I'm a druid, I'll just PL a friend playing the Beastmaster class to 50 and see what loot drops along the way.<br>

<br>
1) Power leveling your nub alts. <br>
 - Take your high level druid and someone's melee class alt, hit them with the buffs, and let them grab 10 mobs. You can level your alt from 1 - 12 in no time.<br>
<br>
2) Low level raids.<br>
  - Low level raids on this zone are fun!!! I have some screen shots http://members.stratos.net/drav/warrens.htm it was a great raid! We killed the king and the only death was my level 10 SK who I forgot to bind in Paineel hehe.<br>
<br>
The Warrens is a horrible zone for any other purpose.<br>

<br>
[b]do you, as a level 60, truly anticipate that there will be items dropping of sub-40 mobs that you want?[/b]<br>
<br>
....i know... there are a handful across the world.  idol of thorned, etc.  so many examples are just silly.  BCP?  who in their right mind would go hunt in Sol B to get a BCP? market value is about 50 pp these days.  there are extremely few items droped by trivial mobs in the OLD WORLD/RoK/SoV that dont follow this pattern...<br>
<br>
and those area werent designed with TLC in place.  SoL IS being designed with TLC in mind.  now read the question again.  you really expecting another idol of the thorned in SoL?<br>
<br>
[b] its a game... how enjoyable, how entertaining is it to camp the static-spawn random-loot model that 99% of loot is attained through when the mobs are green? [/b]<br>
<br>
i TRULY enjoy running the FM cycle, despite the fact that at 51 about 66% of the mobs are green.  its a fun pattern.  as is the TT cycle, also soloable until Doom shows up (ha, no way i can touch him at 51 ).<br>
<br>
but most items arent like that.  the shroud? been there, done that, thats a helluva boring camp even at the right level.  when green... /yawn.  the earring?  god i hate that camp.  soooo boring.<br>
<br>
i mean, you actually WANT to go sit and kill green PH's nonstop for hours upon hours?  hell, if they keep TLC they can keep drop rates and spawn rates high, and you can BUY the item.  <br>
<br>
nothing is more boring to me than killing green PH's.  nothing.  its the reason i dont tailor, its the reason i am perpetually broke (well that and the 2 twinks i support).  i HATE camping greens.  no challenge.<br>
<br>
which brings me to one final point.  ive recently quit playing sullon zek, that new madhouse PvP server.  the ruleset is perfect, but the people... ugh.  no one there engages in even level PvP EVER.  they level up and then kill green-cons. thats what they think PvP is about.<br>
<br>
i left that server becuase killing greens and being killed by reds just aint fun in PvP.  know what?  it aint fun in PvE either.<br>
<br>
bring on the TLC.  il buy any items i cant loot myself, and ill thank the seller for saving me a green campfest. <p>Azeroeth the Vindictive</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urandomuser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>random user</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/27/01 10:20:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My viewpoint on TLC</span><hr size=1> Here's the last thing I will say to you; hopefully it will further illustrate my point that it's pointless to have a discussion with you because of your factual errors, and then I'll shup up and let you have the last word :P<br>

You say, &quot;scarbrow and firbrand have always been green to me, and while they may or may not be blue during triggered rings quests, that holds little difference to me&quot;<br>
<br>
I reply:<br>
<br>
Yeah the non-triggered Scarbrow sucks... or something...<br>
<br>
(For those who do not know, there is no non-triggered Scarbrow, and when he's triggered he is always blue.)<br>

still, you feel the need to bicker, and thats not what this post is about.  i posted a whole paragraph of items off the top of my head and you for some reason feel that arguing that a small handful of them aren't true.  i suppose if that makes you feel good about yourself or whatever, then that's your perogitive.  but really, what's your point? do you deny that good loot drops from green MOBs? <p><img src=http://braidfreak.homestead.com/Files/mylogo.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucobbyl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cobbyl</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/27/01 11:05:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> I would like to clear up a few misconceptions about the new loot code.<br>
<br>
1. No where in the policy does it state that players will have to buy quest loot and/or focus items. This was inferred by a number of the people here to back up their already flawed arguments. No doubt, Verant will make quest and/or No Drop items a special case as these wouldn't necessarily be &quot;farmed.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. In the numerous press releases following the announcement of SoL, Verant made it clear that the new expansion was to be a &quot;group of 6&quot; expansion, as opposed to Velious being a &quot;30+ people raid type&quot; expansion. Reasons for this are obvious - no race can actually begin in Velious. The press announcements for Velious all declared Velious as a place for &quot;hardcore, level 35+ players.&quot; SoL will feature the Vah`Siir class, who will begin on Luclin. It would be very troublesome if there were no places for the Vah`Siir to hunt on Luclin, and everyone who played a Vah`Siir had to get a wizard to port them to the Old World.<br>
<br>
EDIT - I didn't see braidfreak's last post, as I typed part of this message, went out for awhile, and finished it.<br>
<br>
braidfreak - Yes, I will admit, good loot does drop off of green mobs. However, that was put into place before the TLC system was even set up. I highly doubt that Verant will make another Hero Bracer camp, where one can farm to their heart's content, time permitting. Most likely, item drops will be relative to the level of the mob, or any good loot will be extremely rare (take Pyzjin for example. Level 14 mob, drops crap 90% of the time. 1 in about 12 she drops a Glowing Black Stone). Besides, one with such &quot;limitless platinum&quot; and &quot;great items&quot; from PLing people such as yourself shouldn't mind if you actually have to *buy* and item for your level 2 Warrior twink. Oh, and by the way, you spelled &quot;extraordinaire&quot; wrong in your sig. <br>

YES! They did in all the rest of EQ!<br>
<br>
The fact is, if they don't, then they won't NEED the TLC. People only &quot;bottom-feed&quot; because the items they can get are worth the time. duurrrr<br>

<br>
mo, not really.  a lot of bottom feeding is for cash.  i still ahve yet to find a better source of income than grabbing a new medicine totem and selling it, whlie leaving mine on a mule.<br>
<br>
and i dont have a problem with that, as some people do.  its all in HOW you do it, not whether you do it at all.<br>
<br>
what i DO hvae a problem with is the fact that 1999 of the first 2000 items looted in a new expansion  get their drop rates nerfed due to the high levels who can farm them nonstop and &quot;increase the supply of these items beyond what we intended&quot;.  high level farming in a new expansion leads to nerfage of drop rates.  and so it is that the lvl 30's NEVER see this item, because it was nerfed before the lvl 60's were done frming it.<br>
<br>
TLC will make it so that the items which slip in before the post expansion nerfs hit will be in the hands of people who took a risk to get them, instead of the level 60's who took a week off from work.<br>
<br>
and that makes me all kinds of warm and fuzzy. <p>Azeroeth the Vindictive</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucloudanetrihart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cloudane Trihart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=25869912&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/27/01 2:34:33 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> Every time I re-read this reply, I edit it completely....<br>
