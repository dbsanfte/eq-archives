These arguments are moot though now, I think VI finally realizes the disparity, guess we can only wait and hope.  <br>
<br>
This entire situation is like a race, everyone wants to be the best or at least feel that way.  I doubt caster balancing will ever be finished though.  This game changes with each expansion and each patch.  Maybe VI just needs more foresight in terms of the new enviroments they create and how every class in the game interacts with that environment.  They make things progressively more difficult which is good and the way it's supposed to be, and sure, new types of equipment help offset this and is a good basis for this progression, but casters need upgrading as well to stay in this race.  Druids, just happen to be in last place atm. <p>Cheers, <BR>

Most of the bad press about Druids, is supplied by Druids.  I love grouping with Druids, Necros, Mage, Paladin (insert any class other than the Trinity).  These are some of the most powerful classes in the game if played correctly.  This is why I get upset when I hear Druids say they suck or aren't wanted.<br>
<br>
Clerics are the security blanket of EQ.  Not because of CH, but because of REZ.  Maybe the cure all would be to give ALL priest classes a form of rez, I don't know.  Hell, the reason I started my Druid was because I've witness the power Druids have in groups.  A good Druid kicks arse!  I want my Druid to be one of the good Druids (which is why come to this board).<br>
<br>
Druids are a great class, no ifs, and or buts about it.  I just don't think choosing to be second best at something is a good choice for Druids.  There are too many good Druids on this board to not be able to come up with a solution.  Leave the entire healing situation alone and try to think of something new and innovative.  Shaman have found their spot, Clerics have theirs.  Druids need to find something, and if VI can't do it lend them a hand and brainstorm.  But just leave CH out of the equation for once. <p>

I'm not afraid to call it like I see it.  Too many me too opinions around here.  If it weren't for peeps like rtfm with counter opinions this would be a dull board.  I say meet this issues that bug you head on.  I sincerely belive MB, CH and Warrior defensive have jerked the balance of the game towards those classes.  And as such, I'm going to say so.<br>
<br>
So many of you say improve my class - don't nerf the other.  Well, those mistakes are so large that there is no way that VI throw a mistake after another mistake and as such our class will always be behind the power curve.  Ignoring and whispering away the mistakes is like going along with the crowd  -- the Emperor has no clothes.<br>

All it does is allow a warrior to do what a warrior is supposed to do. I don't see how defensive is overpowered at all, at least no more so than slow or haste.<br>
<br>
Mana burn. It isn't very mana efficient and is only overpowered in regards to kunark dragons. That is just a tiny fraction of mobs in the game and they can and probably will fix it in the future.<br>
<br>
CH. Well duh. Of course it is overpowered. But it has also been in the game forever and much of the high end content is based on the fact that CH is in the game. Nerfing CH in any way at this point would require adjusting every high end encounter in the game from Nagy on up and would cause just way too many problems. It isn't worth the pain it would cause to try and mess with CH.<br>
<br>
Calling for nerfs on these other than maybe mb vs kunark dragons is a waste of time and can basically be chalked up as whining. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b>Talyena Trueheart (Dawntreaders)<br>

You really have no clue about what you speak... I am a LONG time 60 druid ( been playing since final beta) and no I am not fine with all the &quot;little&quot; things I can do. <br>
 They amount to ZERO in the end game. And whether you are smart enough to know it or not that is where EQ is going. the END GAME -  UBER MOBS which you probably have no clue about and never raided against. <br>
<br>
When EQ progressed to Kunark release Druid healing was relative to Cleric, an over all percentage less... the same too DoTs with Necroes and Nukes with Wizards.  After kunark release and with the addition of 10 levels we fell behind. With the release of Velious we fell behind more.  With the release of Luclin we fell behind more. <br>
<br>
The end game is raiding, like it or not this is where EQ is going, and this is where most of the &quot;real&quot; druids are at... level 60 raiding.  Or so we wish.<br>
 You say we are useful on raids? grab a brain and read the stuff around you.  Druid isn't even that useful to TP out on end of a high level raid because the wizards can tl to binds and Nexus, which is where most mellee want to go anyway.  <br>
<br>
DoTs and nukes are much better served by other classes over all and healing and buffs are a cleric's domain. <br>
My nice little SoW is is undermined by Run3, snare is on mellee weapons, as well as DoTs, Nukes, and assorted buffs and debuffs, some of which make my spells look sick (as well as other caster spells to).  <br>
<br>
Your worried about group game exp balance? ... if you haven't figured it out by now that &quot;game balance&quot; in this respect is long out the window, then you better find another game to play. <br>
When mellee were &quot;balanced&quot; it was not to pre-60 exp crap, it was to the forward movement of the post60 game. <br>
The mellee (and cleric) items that are dropping in the upper game right now make most of the stuff that come out of anything less then HoT in ToV ( and even some of that loot) look like junk. <br>
Where is the druid in this? Well let's see. We still have trouble getting some spells let alone any power items. The few that a druid can use, as a percentage that do drop are also either/or cleric, shaman, monk, or caster. <br>
And guess what?  Druid is LAST in line in hopes of attaining said items because other classes can make better use of then within the guild. Guild need before personal need. Unfortunately for a raiding guild I have to agree with this ideal, although I hate it. <br>
And yes... every &quot;level60&quot; guild I have come across is a raiding guild. <br>
My guild is a fairly large one almost all level 60&quot;s.  We have done pretty much everything short of Emporer and VT and that is in the very near future. Guild is recruiting in every class atm, with emphasis on warriors and Clerics, except for ...Druids. <br>
So Tettsuo1, don't tell me how priveleged I am as a druid and quit the crap about pre60 balance, because like I already said, notwithstanding the fact CH is unbalanced in this text, the game itself is not &quot;balanced&quot; anymore. <br>
<br>
As a level 60druid, still left somewhere in the middle of Kunark era as far as game mechanics go, I am sick of Verant screwing us over and and pushing us farther and farther into the dirt, and I am sick of people who have no clue about the druid, telling me how &quot;uber&quot; I am.  <br>
Yes I love my druid and play him 95% full time, for over 3 years, but I still should have the ability to be useful and wanted in the high end game.<br>

That way we benifit our guilds, but can't abuse this in xp groups and, god forbid, make the poor clerics obsolete.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't hold your breath waiting for &quot;new multi-grouping&quot; schemata; I think VI has begun to realize that routine multi-group raiding detracts from the game as they originally intended it to be. The fact that multi-group raids have become so standard (and standardized), almost trivializes the whole concept of many players uniting to accomplish unique, sometimes world-changing encounters. <br>
<br>
VI has begun to grasp some of the basic problems with so much of EQ's high level content requiring multiple groups:<br>
<br>
1. Content remains inaccessible to the majority of high level folks, most of whom aren't in massive raiding guilds. (i.e. what good is spending all that time and money developing content that less than 1% of your customers will ever see and appreciate?)<br>
2. The rarer the boss mob, the more strife is caused between players. (i.e. Verant's vision is an environment in which players are driven towards *cooperation* to affect changes to the world around them)<br>
3. There are RL physical limitations -- server, network, bandwidth -- that become spoiling factors to high level encounters where multiple groups are concentrated in a single area of a single zone.<br>
<br>
It seems that VI has begun to veer AWAY from focusing all their attention towards massive encounters, and instead, are moving back towards single-group raiding. You don't have to read between the lines to see this; Shawn Lord (SOE game designer) spelled it out when discussing the PoP expansion:<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the great things about Planes of Power is that it will once again bring back the ability to form pick-up groups and 6 person groups and still be able to engage in raid level encounters...while there will still be encounters tailored to the current system of en-masse or large guild raids, we are trying hard to make the new high level content as accessible to players as we can.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm hopeful that any changes Verant considers making to the druid class, will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> include</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ways to make druids viable enough for pickup groups when only 6 classes can be chosen.<br>
<br>
For many druids, around 50th level was when groups stopped wanting them. For those who have perservered to 60th level in spite of not being very desirable in high level groups, PoP will seem too much like that 50-60 LFG frustration all over again -- unless Verant goes back and addresses the druid class at the very point where they fell behind.<br>
<br>
In other words, if you truly want the druid balanced at 60th level, you're going to have to figure out how to make the class more desirable to groups from 50th and beyond.<br>

Listen up for a moment. Those opinions are yours and do not reflect others'. Calling for manaburn, CH, AND defensive nerfs is <b>unproductive</b> -- it won't happen like that, and you KNOW it. It's also kind of petty. <br>
<br>
I'm sure you have your reasons for thinking those three things are mistakes, and I agree that CH is a mistake, but do you really think VI will REMOVE Complete Healing entirely from the game? Do you think VI will remove the defensive disc? <br>
<br>
State your opinions, state your argument, but don't reduce your voice to the tired old "NERF THIS!" cry. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thorny Ol' Sauerkraut</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 6:15:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Posting Rules: <b>This includes <u>racist</u>, anti-gay, anti-religious or any other spiteful rhetoric targeted toward a specific group. </b><br>

Have you ever seen this movie, Sobe?<br>
<br>

<br>
If you interpreted my post as racist, I apologize.  And was certainly not targeted at any group.<br>
<br>
I was making the analogy that the Druid class is so friggen afraid of actually asking for changes in other class abilities because we don't want to appear *uppity*.<br>
<br>
Look that word up, in the context of my post.<br>
<br>
And if my words, words explicitly chosen on purpose, are racist, then I will find my self in the company Samuel Clemens, Alex Haley, and Alice Walker.<br>
<br>
But of course there are some that burn their words in heaps and piles, as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me ask you another question,,,have you ever heard the nursery rhyme?<br>
<br>
Bah, Bah, Black Sheep.<br>
Have you any wool.<br>
Yes Sir, Yes Sir, Three bags full.<br>
One for my master.<br>
One for my dame.<br>
One for the little boy who lives down the lane.<br>
<br>
Do you know what the black sheep is?  It is not an animal.  It is the illegitimate child of the slave owner and one of his slaves. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A> at: 5/25/02 12:58:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwiseslashwoodkeeper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wiseslash Woodkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 6:57:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27401.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Dangrim you are right i forgot the canni line ;-)<br>
<br>
your post just prove how balancing is hard to do ;-)<br>
<br>
In some sense i agree with you i dislike the large raid<br>
idea, but this way of playing is now how people do.<br>
<br>
At some point years ago verant did a mistake, they made most of the high end encounters undoable by a 6 people group. <br>
<br>
The second mistake was complete heal that as you mentionned was not introduced as a combat spell but as a downtime reducer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Post 50 the major problem is that challenging encounters<br>
are Metal based (which mean you need clerics and may be a cleric chain, and sometimes slow, and melee damage dealer).<br>
<br>
This is not the case in the pre 50 game. <br>
<br>
This problem affect all the non holy classes (tanks, hubrids, monks, enchanter shamen clerics)<br>
and mage wizzard and druids are in trouble. <br>
<br>
<br>
Verrant effort to make mage and wizzard more usefull in typical post 50 encounters is clear, even if i m not sure that<br>
i would be happy to trade my druid for a mage .<br>
<br>
The picture is very complex, but what i m sure is that Verrant will never be able to balance the post 50 game if they don't include CHeal, slow and haste in their equations.<br>
