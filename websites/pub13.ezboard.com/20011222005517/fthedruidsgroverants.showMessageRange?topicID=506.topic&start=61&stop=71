However, what I find silly is to have wolf form memmed instead of sow. WHY???? I am a breath away from 56 and my wolf form lasts ...oh I don't remember....2?...3?...hrs.........Why in the heck would I keep it memmed???? I cast it on myself, ditch it and remem sow. Why? Becasue, undoubtedly, someone will come crawling along, needing it. But, more importantly, something could DISPELL me (or do other similar vile things), I lose wolf, and if I can't sow myself quickly after ensnaring the evil MOB, my pretty little butt is ancient history.<br>

Haggling and bitching over sowing or buffing  people seems so silly and trivial. <br>

<br>
From the perspective of someone who has had a break from EQ and its society, it's interesting how most EQ players get so fired up about various things that seem rather trivial right now.  Now, this isn't a flame, since I got rather like that myself last time I was here (lots of self righteousness and just lots of &quot;being angry&quot;).  It's just interesting, how everyone gets so worked up over simple things like asking for That Spell, or even complaining about the &quot;tone&quot; of someone's typed message (I was guilty of that, and it seems silly now).<br>
Maybe a break every so often from EQ and all its message boards, would be good for anyone.  Worked for me, I'm a lot calmer and less hostile now, and thirsting for some EQ play again :)<br>

My personal reactions are usually dependent on the situation, zone, and number of requests , not to mention what I am doing at the time.<br>
<br>
But all peevs aside, just be nice to people and they are usually nice to you.<br>
<br>
If you are in a rush and need to get something done for you, if the person asking is nice himself he will understand and not bitch.<br>
<br>
If you are not doing anything and are not responding to those who want (not need) then generally you are RUDE too. (this is not saying you owe anyone anything).<br>
<br>
The higher level you are the more you get in the ignore noob role of things. ( this is mostly the noobs fault for not doing anything on there own, but we all are guilty of it at high levels at least).<br>
<br>
I have read all the thread and think that the druid should have sown him, if he  was there 2 mins before porting and if not he did the right thing and left. ( he did not owe the sow either way ). <br>
<br>
In a different post I read that one person ignores the tells in noob zones and buffs the non geared hard working 3/24 dagger types. =P me too ) . keke, ever see a level one with sow SLN regrowth and 24 point ds ). keke and yes I said regrowth. Just wanted to divert those saying it cant be cast on a level one. The group spell can, at least via the SS quest armor.<br>
<br>
The original guy asking for the sow if he wasnt rude at the time sure showed his true colors in the thread. keke yep you B rude.<br>
<br>
The original druid who said he  just got his ports, and was doing them to make cash also said if I remember correct he had 4 k in bank and paw of oppallo. both at 29. well good job and stop bragging . also if you have 4k in bank why you need to be porting for cash to pay for the spells ? I was kinda suspicious of your original thread. as well as boofys response.<br>
<br>
*key* be nice, it will take you far. Just don't get walked on. There are many out there who have boots. sigh too bad there not Jboots ).<br>

He was powerlevelled to 50 so he really doesn't understand what druid life is about.  He CAN'T know what it's about since he didn't live through it like most of us here have done.  He didn't zone into Gfay and have 10 tells before he got into the zone, all asking for teleport, sows, money, stuff for newbies, etc.  No one bothers a warrior for buffs, and bards can mainly just benefit you if you are grouped with them.  As far as druidic experience goes, he should be treated as if he bought the druid on ebay since he hasn't really spent any time playing it for real.<br>
<br>
Those of us who have spent lots of time really playing our characters do get annoyed when someone thinks so little of us that they demand what we 'owe' them since we chose a utility class.  Personally, I chose a druid because I wouldn't have to bother other people for teleports and sows.  So for that, I should be penalized by having to sow every dumbass that comes up and says 'sow plz' (can't type those extra three characters to spell 'please' either I guess - at least they typed the shortened version though).  I'm sure most of you have seen people hanging around asking for sow or teleports for an hour or more, when they could easily have run the distance without it in a shorter period of time.  They have become dependent upon it, and they think they absolutely can't live without it.<br>
<br>
If this person asked as he said he did, then I might have sow'd if I didn't have a gate in progress.  But since there are usually plenty of druids or shamen around he could easily have found another or done without.  There is no need for anyone to send private tells to someone fussing at them for not doing a favor.  I don't think SoW is a buff that is mandatory for playing the game anyway, although it is a nice convenience.  Oh yeah, and don't forget that there ARE SoW potions available from shamen so people will not have to depend upon us druids and shamen for sows.  The cost on Rallos is usually about 100pp for a 10 shot sow potion, so ante up and no one will have to fuss about it any more.<br>
<br>
And, by the way, I do my share of charity work any time I'm near a newbie zone or a zone line.  A few SLN's can sure trash a mana bar, and if you add regens and thorn shields a druid will drop to low mana very quickly.  The only thing we get out of it is the joy of giving and watching a newbie have fun.  Nothing better than watching a true newbie discover what a few good buffs will do.  Heh, they think they're Superman or something, running through Misty or EC killing everything in sight.  Quite funny actually.  Buffing newbies is a sport I highly recommend, especially if you've tired of the game somewhat yourself.<br>

<br>
But I'll just say this, when you start out brand new to the game with no main's to fund your new toons, the game is a pain, but it's fun, and it's way cool when some lvl 30+ (when your lvl 6 or so) come up to you and gose here and hands you some stuff, and then buffs the hell out of ya it's a blast.<br>
<br>
Hell i've done that, now that I've made my self a druid, he's at lvl 16 now and makeing cash hand over foot with sow's and tailoring, but I also use the faloseify, fa, fa ,fa ahh @#%$ I'm brain dead for spelling right now, I use the rule of, buff the way true noob's and give them loot armor and other stuff from trade skill that I have no ue for and can not sell, (large tailored belt pouch for exsample), and when they go I have no way to repay you, just tell them, well when I was smaller bigger people where nice to me, so I'm just repaying the favor that was done for me. It works so well, they think your god and they will give stuff that they normal would have sold or distroyed to some way young noob, that needs it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok now on the topic of the thred, Boofy, jsut cause you have a 51 druid, dose NOT give you the right to demand one from someone else when your not playing your druid, if you truely have a 51 druid, hop on and goto a noob zone or better yet goto EC when it's packed, and shout SoWing at tunnle, and see how ong it takes before your oom from being &quot;Mr. Nice guy&quot; and buffing and porting everyone that asks, I'm allmost willing to bet once they figure out that you can SLN and Wolf fourm and regen and DS you'll be oom in about five min, then you get spend 20 min gettting your mana back from the buffing then go oom agian in five min, Now lets say you hoped on to do something else, and you get 30 some odd tells in two min asking for SoW and hand outs, and you can't get you want done. I gernurntee that you will change your tune about saying that it's the druid's JOB to SoW you. <br>
<br>
I have a 24 ranger and sence about he was about lvl 14 he has been asked for SoW's, and my druid my god that was even worse not even lvl 8 and was starting to get tell from eBay babys and true noob for SoW's, it got old for me befor I could even SoW peeps......................................... Opps i guess I went into rant mode there, it just peve's me when people go off and say that about druid's, the only thig peve's me more is that alot I mean ALOT of peep regaurd druids as transport only class. ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have friend who is playing a druid for one reason to get him to 29 for the normal port loc's so he can port peeps around for cash, that buggs be me some how, but when your man is a shammie and doing alcamey man acn he use the cash for it. hehe so I don't have the much a problem with him doing that for the cash. But what dose bother me is when a &quot;high lvl&quot; toon that has three toon about 50 and all of them are like tanks or finger wiggler's treating druids as purely a way of transportion around Norath. grrr that bugs me, and what I love is when one of them plays a druid up to like 30+ and then stops playing the druid cause he/she got tired of the constant tells for SoW's ports and buffs.<br>
