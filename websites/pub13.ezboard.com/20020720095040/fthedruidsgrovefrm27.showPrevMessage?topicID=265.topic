I can see loosing stealth when he releases it.  Maybe the sound gives him away.  But I think at nocking is a bit early. <br>

The 10 seconds, well that's just a bug fix.  The truth is in heavy cover I'm not likely to see the archer who kills me AT ALL.  ;)  So I don't see this affecting me much. <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

<br>
Readying and nocking an arrow, drawing a bowstring, aiming to fire, especially a 6' long bow requires you stand straight up, stready you aim, and then release the arrow.<br>
<br>
Use your terrain to your advantage.  Make a different set of 'camoflage' armor, with light browns and greens.  Here's a suggestion for snipers, GROUP.  The best German sniper in WW2 was taken out by a team of 2 Russian snipers via some teamwork.<br>
<br>
Have 4 archers releasing their arrows at the same time, at the same targets, creates havoc among some of the best organized groups.<br>
<br>
Being as a Ranger is my secondary character, I'm kinda glad that the element of skill has been re-introduced to the snipers.  Now you need to hide behind trees and rocks, within the nooks and crannies of the hillside.<br>

Of course not.  You're in cammies, or up a tree, etc.  And drawing the bow involves some movement as well.  You do it in the sight of whatever you're shooting at, they very well might see you.  So use those same tactics as a bow hunter....hide in brush and trees, wear cammies, don't use a torch (doh!).  Don't expect to be able to stand up in an open field with a long bow 20 yards from a group of people, draw your bow and prepare to fire, all without being seen.  That's insane...:)<br>
<br>
Stealth in the game is like magic.  You effectively turn invisible, even when you're standing somewhere in plain sight of others.  Can't draw RL parallels very easily to that.<br>

Besides, realism has little to do with games (magic, anyone?).  Games bend the rules to create a fun and balanced environment.  If one technique, such as archery, is unbalanced, it gets toned down, whether realistic or not. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 11/6/01 12:57:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaurincotg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saurin CoTG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/6/01 5:38:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=174.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> The version notes for the most recent patch clarify this change a bit, essentially, a skill check is now performed upon nocking the arrow with a chance to remain hidden or a chance of failure depending upon spec level.

The first part is him ripping VN Boarders much needed new aholes. Second part is how they are actually going to implement the patch.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
And so it starts… This simple phrase has been used as an indictment of Mythic for certain contemplated aspects of our next patch. Unfortunately, these words are equally applicable to both behavior attributed to Mythic as well as by the player community. In the last two days we’ve seen email and posts taking us to task for some corrective action we are taking in the next patch of DAoC. I’ve been appalled by some of the things and attitudes I’ve seen on these boards lately. We need to get some things clear right now. <br>
<br>
1) The changes that Sanya talked about were “proposed” changes to the system. We may make lots of proposed changes over the life of the product. The reason we tell the community about it is because we don’t do stealth nerfs, stealth changes, stealth bombers, we tell you about it. We tell you about so that we can tell you about what we are thinking about doing in the next version. We then put the version up on Pendragon where we can test these changes and adjust (or get rid of them) accordingly. She was correct in referring to the changes to archers as bug fixes. <br>
<br>
2) We are not Verant, Funcom, OSI, your moms, dads or your significant others. We are Mythic and you must judge us as that alone. I’m sorry if you feel someone else has burned you and that you still have charred skin. I’m sorry if you feel another developer is better than us and that we suxoor. I’m sorry if you think that we (or I specifically) have lied to you. We have gone above and beyond in communicating with the community and we continue to do so. We give the community more information about what we are working on, on our strengths and weaknesses and even our long-term plans than any other developer at this stage of a game’s evolution. Constant threats, whining, mailbox bombing will only ensure that we will no longer do community management at a public site. This time much of the community here overreacted and it was not pretty. Please keep this behavior up if you want to drive us off these boards. <br>
<br>
3) We owe nothing to archers, mages, and fighters as individual classes. Rather we owe a duty to all the classes and the community as a whole to ensure that the game is fun for everybody and not just for one class. As this game evolves other changes will be made to make the game better for all. Sometimes we will add things, sometimes we will change things, and sometimes we will remove things. That is part of an MMOG. Anyone who says that everything should be set in stone and perfect from the beginning should not be playing these types of games. We will continue to make the game better for our players to make this the best MMORPG in the market. Sometimes you will like what we do, sometimes you won’t. What you have to expect is that you will not always like everything that we do. If you insist on getting your way every time and that is the only way you will be satisfied, you will not be happy with these type of games. <br>
<br>
4) We do not ask the moderators here to ban people, lock threads or do anything in managing their site. They alone manage their site and we think that they are doing a fine job. I’ve been asked why mods are locking threads on the boards. Well, from what I’ve seen, I don’t blame them. We don’t need twenty threads on archers all saying the same things. The more threads that are out there all saying the same thing, the less likely any one of them will be responded to. Also, the more threads that there are, the harder it is to keep up with the other issues players have with the game. Now, while it is true that after a thread reaches a certain point it gets out of hand but I’d rather have one long thread than twenty short ones. <br>
<br>
5) As I’ve said before, our first priority is to make a fun game. So, even if have to make changes to the game that turn out to be wrong, guess what, we will fix them again and again if necessary until we get it right. We have never been shy admitting when we made/make a mistake. We don’t try to hide it in spin. So, if we screw up we’ll tell you and we’ll work to make it right. All of Mythic is focused on DAoC for now and the foreseeable future. This means that we will have the time and people to keep working on the game. Many in the community are acting as if we didn’t have the time, inclination or people to changes things again if necessary. Please look at the amount of work that is involved in each week’s patch to see our effort and output. So getting all worked up instantly is pretty pointless. Give us a chance and see why we are different. For those of you who went through our beta program, I hope you will agree that we are. For those of you who are new at this, I hope you will extend us the same courtesy. <br>
<br>
In the upcoming version you will see a host of bug fixes and some changes. We fixed some things with archers that will not impact them as a class as severely as you folks seemed to think they would. The notes I have enclosed below. I’ve listed the archer section here and below since it is of such great concern to people. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------- <br>
- Archer classes now have a chance of becoming visible when they nock their arrow. The way it worked up until now is that archers would always be invisible if they were using stealth until they fired their bow. Now, a skill check is performed when they &quot;nock&quot; their arrow. If they fail the check, they become visible. The chance to become visible is based on their specialization in Stealth. On normal (i.e. NOT critical shots), if they are 50% specc'ed in stealth, they will have a 50% chance of becoming visible; if they are 100% specc'ed, they will have a 100% chance of remaining hidden. On Critical Shots, the chance is the same as a normal shot, minus 20% - so an archer max specc’ed in stealth will have an 80% of remaining hidden after nocking his bow. Please note that in all cases, an archer will become visible once the shot is actually fired. <br>
<br>
- You can no longer hide when your arrow is in-flight (before it hits your opponent). <br>

==============<br>
MARK AND MYTHIC FREAKIN ROCK! Way to put the VN Boarders in their place. Will it help? No, because VN Boarders will be VN Boarders, bunch of whiney ass trolls.<br>
<br>
I think that Mythic made an awesome move incooperating stealth skill into this equation. This will really help Albion Scouts who need something to make them a little more unique. They have no magic, pathetic melee, they have their longbows and thats it. An Alb Scout that isn't maxed in bow and stealth is a freaking dumb arse. <br>
<br>
Mg Hunters arent going to be to happy about this as most of them end up at about 1/2 spec'd in stealth because they are more dependent upon there spell and spear line of skills as compared to Rangers and Scouts. <br>
<br>
Rangers are looking good with this patch too, melee skills are not to important to us, you only really need to raise your melee skill to get detaunt for either blade or pierce. Pathfinding doesnt need to be really high for it to be effective, so bow and stealth should be primary skills for an Ranger who plans to PvP alot.<br>
<br>
Currently I'm Lvl 35, 10 in pierce, 20 in pathfinding, 27+2 in stealth, 34+2 in bow. Next lvl i should have about 82 spec pts to use, can you say 2 pts in stealth and 3pts into stealth the lvl after that? I thought you could =) I'm spec'n nothing but bow and stealth from now until they are maxed for my lvl. Then i'll raise pathfinding up a bit too, think it will end up being 25 or 27 something like that.  <p><table>

Gotta get me a ranger partner, no one else in my guild is playing a ranger to high level. There is a nightshade up and coming, though... <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>

Hmm, im on that server and have been soloing a lot right where you speak of. Haven't had any problems. About a week about i did get ganked by a duo twice, but shortly after that, a few higher levels watched over us and shortly killed one and ran the other off (i.e. camped out apparently). <br>
<br>
With the large amount of traffic that comes through there, no one is going to &quot;hold&quot; that area without a massive force. Sure you might be able to slay a few greys every now and then, but that usually comes to an end pretty soon as either the low level players go somewhere else after being slain a few times or, as is often the case, some higher levels shadow the group and pounce on the attackers. Perhaps they &quot;held&quot; the area during low usage times, but i didnt see anything of this nature during &quot;primetime&quot; this past week ~shrug~. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, stealth is still too overpowering an ability in its present form. It should make more sense in terms of re-stealthing i think. Meaning that once unstealthed, you can't restealth in the view of enemies. Probably too hard to code such a thing given the dynamics of the game, but thats my take on it. Personally i think more stealth ability nerfs will be coming down the pipe than just the recent ones on Pendragon. Maybe not direct nerfs, maybe something along the lines of See Invisibility spells or something of that nature. <br>

I wouldn't be surprised if there's some sort of adjustment, but I would be bummed :-) I do trust Mythic to not go overboard with balancing, though.  <p><b>Gallatin</b><p>
