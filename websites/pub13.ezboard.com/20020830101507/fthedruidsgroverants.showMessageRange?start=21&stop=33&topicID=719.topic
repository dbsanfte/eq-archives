<br>
I came here because of the link Herder placed at the VCC because I was curious about all of the hulabaloo. I would have liked to have seen what he posted that was so bad that he was banned and anything he posted deleted but that's impossible I guess.<br>
<br>
My purpose is not to flame or stir up any kind of crap. Like many people my first character was a druid. This was when sup heal was the best we got and way before VI did an excellent job balancing druids. To be honest, it is my truthful opinion that Druids are the only class they got right. Many classes were made incredibly powerful and some others were diluted through the strengthening of others.<br>
<br>
While it is true Druids do not have a defining raid characteristic, I find that to be indicative of the core reasoning behind the class itself. We are almost masters of everything! Druids may not have an exact defined role on a raid but they fill all of the holes and they are *required* and *needed* to fill those holes. <br>
<br>
While i am not sure what Herder said to you all here and how he may have phrased things what he said over on the thread at the VCC moved me to want to come here and share that I love Druids and feel they are the most versatile class in the game hands down. <br>
<br>
Currently, I play a 60 ogre warrior but warriors pretty much suck so I've been playing my wife's 52 druid as well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=prybutok>Prybutok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333399>(7/23/02 12:44:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=719.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HerderVazaelle</span><hr size=1> Sorry to spam you but one of the things I wanted to do was post what Herder said that made me want to come over here.

<br>
He was still a very wanted and desired person for raids and xp groups. He could solo, he could duo with any class and he was always low mana due to the many spells in my arsenal and the demands for those spells.<br>
<br>
Currently, druids are wanted for healing, nuking, snaring, evaccing, regen, ports, sow/soe, dmg shield, ac/hp buffs, str buffs, harmony, tracking, forage, dots, etc.<br>
<br>
I had always visited Druids Grove because that was the first class I played but lately it has degenerated into a cesspool of whiners, the moderators leading the pack and whipping them into a frenzy of self-hate.<br>
<br>
I tried to make them see that they are loved and needed. They called me an idiot. I tried to tell them to be conscientious druids and work with other druids and they said I knew nothing of the high end game.<br>
<br>
So, they ended up banning me and removing every post I made. I guess they showed me.<br>
<br>
If you want to be a better nuker, be a wizzy. Just remember all those other neat spells you give up. If you want to be a better healer, be a cleric, just remember all those neat spells you give up. <br>
<br>
EQ was built around 14(15) classes, not 1. Lets use those strengths and weaknesses to our benefit.<br>
<br>
One druid was complaining that most uber guilds only have 6-8 druids with a roster of 80. Hello? Thats almost 10percent of the guild full of druids. How many SK's are in that guild? Paladins? Mages? Enchanters even?<br>
<br>
Druids stack infinitely. Healing Stacks. Damage Stacks.<br>
<br>
Druids are the 2nd best Healer and 2nd best nuker in the game. What you say? Shamans are 2nd best due to torpor? Well then if you want to include timed release heals, lets talk regrowth of the grove. With the 10pct penalty removed, healing foci and healing crits, I fully believe Druids have all the tools they need for remaining one of the top classes in EQ since its inception.<br>
<br>
Make druids better and you will just have more druids because the class is so damn easy to level. This is your main problem, not the lack of abilities or desire. Guilds want you, problem is they already have 8 who hit level 60 2 years ago. <br>

Unfortunately for Herder, the game has changed since he was playing his druid. Druids are not the second-best healer in the game. The fact that Herder would say that shows that he is out of touch with druids' capabilities in the endgame.<br>
<br>
Let's talk Regrowth of the Grove, as Herder suggested. It's not a heal-over-time. It's a group regeneration spell. If he really knew druids inside-out, then why would he call ROTG a &quot;timed release heal&quot;? <br>
<br>
Also unfortunately for Herder, he started the arguments with posters by attacking them personally. Now, if he had valid arguments to post, why did he stoop to cheap tactics to belittle those posters into believing him? He lost his credibility by insulting them.<br>
<br>
As such, the moderators had every right to step in and warn him. Herder received warnings to clean up his act, but he continued to flame those posters. After I warned him, he apparently flamed me, too, and darn it, I wish I had seen his flame because I do get a chuckle out of them. <br>

<br>
I understand your protectiveness of Mr. Herder.. the truth is he has no clue.. has no understanding of the class and doesn't no jack.. he can go piss himself on his own boards all he wants, he is their hero, and since he isn't a community member he's a flat out punk that deserves no less attention then the dribble he spits out.  <br>
<br>
He want to talk about his own abilities IE: Jack of all trades, list out everyone of the spells an Enchanter can cast, AA, or item.. count em up, compare them to what a Melee can get in items, potions, weapons etc... , then take that same exact list and compare it to the Druid Class.<br>
<br>
Here is a partial list of abilities that pure melee classes can currently gain from items:<br>
<br>
<br>
Damage shields<br>
Invis<br>
AC buff<br>
Regen<br>
SoW<br>
Infra/ultravision<br>
+ATK<br>
+STR, etc. most stats<br>
Haste<br>
Slow<br>
Very fast run speed (horses)<br>
Illusions<br>
Bind sight (albiet consumable)<br>
Stat debuff<br>
Locate corpse<br>
Resistance buffs<br>
Blind<br>
DA<br>
Snare<br>
Root<br>
Charm<br>
Cancel magic<br>
Gate<br>
See invis<br>
Shadow step<br>
+Faction<br>
Enduring breath<br>
Rune<br>
Mana regen<br>
Levitate<br>
Resurrect<br>
<br>
The further you dig down at what the real problem the more you will see that the old Jack of all Trades argument becomes Invalid. Sure we are powerful nukers if we are an Evocation Druid, but Druids get to choose between Alteration and Evocation.. each handicapping the other. VI Designed the Druid class to be both, and is the only class that can truely go both paths. AA points screwed that system up allowing a better nuking druid and failing to bring the Healing up to par.. that is being change.  <br>
<br>
I am not bitching about how I play, hell I got it good - Evo all the way.  I know how to play my class, very well. I use everything in my arsenal. But when a Cleric or a Monk ask for Invis and a Warrior starts casting it.. it removes me my JOAT role even further. Utilities I have, but using them I cannot because most have an item or two to cover it. Resist.. screw resist.. everyone can get resist now-a-days. +50.. all those petal spells and now Resistance to Magic, basically perm effect for Melee. I have a Fire Debuff line, I have Track. On a Bluebie server.. fire debuff is okay but has been deflated due to increased ATK, HP, AC in places like VT. RoTG compared to Torpor.. well .. did he know that Torp is 2100 heal with Full AA's? I don't complain.. I THINK ITS GREAT!  RoTG is great but doesn’t stack with Dain’s 10th Ring, and most melee prefer the increase of ATK above +5 more regen.. those are the facts!<br>
<br>
No one here wants to get others nerfed, its caster balancing.. we just do not want some lame change that keeps us in our little corner like Herder wants. Does he know how retarded this sounds.. hey lets upgrade all the other classes and since Druids are balanced (per his opinion) we don't need to touch them.. and if they want to heal.. make a cleric and if they want to nuke make a wizard. WTF type of logic is that? We picked the class because we could choose to do both and still Travel, with the understanding that we were niether cleric nor wizard.. but we are Druids.. this doesn't mean we can't be 2nd best in Alteration or Evocation.. but what he fails to realize is that "YOU CAN ONLY BE ONE, 2nd BEST due to Specialization". Furthermore we are limited in both areas due to not having the protection of a Cleric and the Hate removal of a Wizard.. agian something he fails to realize... numbers are great on paper, but the reality is much different.<br>
<br>
He states, go to the nice community.. he just doesn't realize is that half of this community resides in both places and due to VI policy of Community relations, One board had to be hit.. sure VI can go to EQDruids, but the same thing that has occurred here will happen there.<br>
<br>
As for why I removed him from the community site... it was because of Herders "I am fcking god complex"  ...His attitude on this board was "here is my argument and if you disagree "You Suck" .. how mature. When the Mod's tried to save the thread from being dumped into rants, not touching what he already said and only asked him to tone it down he only showed disrespect and accused them of manipulating the community .. he's a fucktard.. he was so proud of his statements that he had to show his entire community on the VCC  rant section so more could see his work, calling all those that defended the position for Druids "Fcuking whiners".. thats fine, he's King of his Court, our community leads there own destiny.. thats how it works here.. the difference is he broke the rules..<br>
<br>
If he wants to have it out on a Druid Class board because his pee pee was hurt thats too bad, if he wants to say "the moderators leading the pack and whipping them into a frenzy of self-hate." thats fine, but our community knows this isn't true. In the big picture, The Grove has prompted changes not only for the Druid class but other classes as well; they were smart changes and not overly powerful (10% Healing Penalty Removed), Clorablast and Natures Touch. The Moonfire spell change allowing it to actual be useful to our Evocation Druids Brethren, PoTC, and many more minor changes. He labels the entire community of wanting this or that when I can count those same people on my hand(its called frustration)... that my friend isn’t the ENTIRE community.<br>
<br>
The community here enjoys the boards, understands there is a limit and rules. They also understands that the staff is part of the community, that means we don't STFU. We don't start all the threads here, we bring up discussions and new ideas from time to time and we pay for the main site and the rest of it is all Volunteer work and community driven.  We maintain the boards.. archive good content and ensure they don't get out of hand because in the end the community pays for the space, and the less they have to pay without losing the enjoyment of discussion, the better off we all are. Herder stomped on that and in return he was removed.<br>
<br>
Let him walk over to Safehouse, Steel Warriors, Graffe’s or any other class board and do the same thing.. they won’t be so kind asking him to tone it down. <br>
<br>
I appreciate your feedback Ogre Warrior of VCC; it will allow us to better deal with these types of people in the future.<br>

<br>
Anyways I think it was a mistake to delete all his posts. Reminds me of the book &quot;1984&quot; where Big Brother can pretty much erase people from existance (kill them and remove any evidence of their existence). It was one thing to ban him. However now no one knows why. They just see you saying he was a troll. But no one can judge for themselves. That thread is a bit screwed up now because you deleted all his posts.<br>
<br>
Ahem, power trip. The Druids Grove hasn't had any trolls in a while so you just went all out on him I guess.<br>
<br>
I guess my point of view is skewed a bit. I did know him on Tallon Zek when he had his 55 druid. He was good at it. And I know him now on Vazaelle as a 60 enchanter. He's good at that too. So go ahead and flame me for defending him. <p><p><table border="0">
