Does that mean that the producer was liable for that kid's death?  No.  During my freshman year of college, some kid at my university stuffed a shotgun in his mouth and blew his brains out because he failed a test.  Does that mean the professor who gave the test was liable for that kid's death?  No.<br>
<br>
It's not pleasant that some player killed himself.  However, the article does not contain a scintilla of evidence that EQ was the cause of the suicide.  It only contains wild speculation that because the person played EQ and killed himself, he must have killed himself because something bad in EQ happened.<br>
<br>
Can EQ be addicting to a certain type of person?  Certainly.  I don't think anyone will dispute that assertion.  Just about anything amusing, entertaining or pleasant can be addictive to a greater or lesser degree.  The Internet can be addictive.  Chat rooms can be addictive.  Football can be addictive.  Gambling can be addictive.  But I challenge you to create the definitive profile of a person prone to addiction to a particular thing.  I can just imagine the kind of warning label on Planes of Power:<br>
<br>
"WARNING!  This game is addictive to certain personality types.  If you are depressed, have no job, have no friends, are overweight, are in poor physical health, enjoy escaping into a magical fantasy realm and forming e-friendships, cannot handle rejection, set-backs or conflicts, playing this game may cause severe harm to your emotional health and psyche, and may ultimately result in suicide."<br>
<br>
You know, you may as well force schools to post signs when selling prom tickets stating:<br>
<br>
"WARNING!  If you turn down an invitation to the prom by some pimply faced kid, you may turn him into the next Ted Bundy."<br>
<br>
(For those of you who don't know, psychologists and psychiatrists speculated that Ted Bundy's serial killings were at least partially triggered by his girlfriend's rejection of his marriage proposal, since his victims always bore a striking resemblance to the girl who rejected him).<br>
<br>
And then there is the question of whether a warning label would even help.  We know for a fact that gambling can be addictive to certain people, but do you EVER see a warning sign posted at a casino or pasted on a slot machine?<br>
<br>
Being an attorney, I can see both sides of the issue.  But neither society nor the law requires that we take precautions against every possible mishap or injury.  We only owe a duty of care to prevent reasonably foreseeable injury or harm to those around us.  I sincerely doubt this sort of occurrence was reasonably foreseeable.  Sure, in retrospect, we can see it.  But before seeing the article, how many of you reasonably believed that a difficult corpse recovery or losing a duel or losing some equipment or bad customer service would really present an even miniscule risk of pushing someone to actually commit suicide?  I know I sure didn't.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the implications if you believe this suicide was reasonably foreseeable:<br>
<br>
1. If your guild is raiding NToV and some stranger wants to tag along and share in the loot, YOU MUST accept that person because he may be mentally unstable and your rejection of him could push him over the edge.<br>
<br>
2. YOU MUST accept every applicant into your guild because that person might not be able to handle the rejection.<br>
<br>
3. Verant must employ an army of GMs to provide ANY service requested, because a lost corpse or item might drive a mentally fragile person to commit suicide.<br>
<br>
See what I mean?  Are any of those situations really "reasonably foreseeable"?  Of course not.  In everyday life, people do not kill themselves over little things.  I really doubt that this case will get very far.  If the potential injury to a single, specific person can only be foreseen by some guy who practices in an arcane field of pyschology, then it's not going to be reasonably foreseeable.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry some person decided to end his life.  However, there is no proof that EQ or anything related to online gaming caused his suicide.<br>
 <p>That which does not kill you will probably make you wish that it had.<BR>
