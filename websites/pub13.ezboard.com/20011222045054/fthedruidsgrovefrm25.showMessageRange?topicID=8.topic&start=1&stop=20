And by PvP, I mean human conflict...conflict between human-controlled characters.<br>
<br>
When you attack an NPC of any sort, you really are attacking characters controlled by the person sitting across the table...the GM.  In every game I've played, the GMs have all been human (although it might be questionable in some cases).<br>
<br>
You can also attack PCs...characters controlled by the person sitting next to you.  This rarely happens, and with good reason.  But the potential for it is still there.  And if roleplayed well and in context, it can lead to some of the more memorable gaming sessions you will ever have.<br>
<br>
In either case you expect to be held accountable for your actions.  And that is probably the key distinction between P&amp;P RPGs and MMORPGs.  In MMORPGs, players feel that they can escape accountability for their actions.  And by and large, they can.  The problem is how to incorporate the potential of human conflict in an MMORPG without it overrunning and ruining the game.<br>
<br>
The problem might be summed up as follows: A little spice enhances the broth; too much spoils the soup.<br>
<br>
There are a number of MMORPGs coming out in the next year or two that seek to solve this problem.  EQ tried to do this by incorporating a PvP switch, but getting rid of the potential of human conflict isn't a real &quot;solution.&quot;<br>
<br>
A PvP switch in an RPG is the equivalent of a lobotomy.  The more ways you limit player choice in a RPG, the less of a roleplaying game it is.  The point of a RPG is for you to put yourself into the shoes of your character, and act and react as if you were that character.   <br>
<br>
One &quot;ideal&quot; of a good RPG is to have no effective difference between PCs and NPCs in the game.  After all, to your character, the terms PC and NPC are meaningless: they are people, animals, monsters, etc.  Being able to attack NPCs but not PCs abrogates that ideal.  (Of course, EQ abrogates it in other ways, as well.  But EQ is not really a fully-fledged RPG in a lot of ways.)<br>
<br>
The fact that there is a large population of griefers out there ready to romp in any MMORPG they can doesn't change the above analysis.  It just means that to have a true RPG online, you have to take the griefers into account.  <br>
<br>
UO struggled with this, and by and large failed.  DAC and AO have presented different takes on ways to include some of the &quot;spice&quot;  of human conflict without &quot;spoiling the soup.&quot; Star Wars Galaxies also has a fresh take (Raph says he has learned from the attempts to control PvP in UO).<br>
<br>
How much &quot;spice&quot; depends on the game.  Some games, in fact, like Shadowbane, make the PvP element the primary focus of the game.  Whether this appeals to you is a matter of personal taste.  I personally like the way DAC is going: you don't have to engage in PvP, but there is a focused, directed PvP element in the end game.  <br>
<br>
Whether they will succeed or not remains to be seen.  But I applaud any attempt to include the possibility of PC conflict in an MMORPG.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A> at: 7/6/01 12:24:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorrun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrun</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/6/01 12:07:30 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> This is what happens when we let Scirocco moderate a section.. he gets into "thinker" mode and next thing we know the Illiad spits out.<br>

<br>
A GM can make sure that the Red Dragon that the PCs just wandered upon is "lost in thought..." or otherwise not hungry, so that the entire party that took 3 REAL hours to get to where it was going is not eaten in a single round of combat.<br>
<br>
Try wandering up to Nagafen and see how much pitty you get walking into his lair...<br>
<br>
Basically, it is "Rules-Bending" that makes PvP acceptable and fun.  This is impossible to do without interaction between GM and Player durring 100% of the session.<br>
<br>
Server Games will always fail at PvP (IMHO) due to the fact that "Server AI" instead of a thoughtful-GM will be making the majority of player-affecting decisions.<br>
<br>
Now... take a game like NeverWinter Nights where a player is acting as GM, and you have my interest. <p><table width="600" border="0" height="138">

P&amp;P Games are actually a conflict between PCs and GM controlled NPCs, it's a very important distinction.<br>
<br>
Just because there is a person controlling (somewhat) the actions of the NPC doesn't make it PvP.  The GM has certain rough rules of behavior to follow with each NPC.<br>
<br>
Take GM events for instance, they are *not* pvp even though both sides of the conflict are controlled by humans.  The NPCs in GM events are following a set script with a small amount of variation.<br>
<br>
PvP is about killing other players that have about the same options you do.  NPCs are not groomed and lvl'd and equipped, they are simply spawned (created).  <br>
<br>
PvP brings out the worst in people, period.  Anytime you have a situation where you give grief players the tools they need to screw over other people, you're going to have serious problems.<br>
<br>
I don't think you can argue that P&amp;P games turned people into exploiting ego-maniacs.  The fact that the EQ pvp servers have an almost unlimited stream of CS problems kinda speaks for itself. <p><IMG SRC="http://lordfate.homestead.com/files/misc/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueqaquinas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQAquinas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/6/01 1:52:09 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> <i>And that is probably the key distinction between P&P RPGs and MMORPGs. In MMORPGs, players feel that they can escape accountability for their actions. </i><br>
<br>
I’m not sure I see PvP combat as the reason for this difference.  I can see at least two other factors (in addition to the human factor mentioned by Paldor) that, in my view, are more important.  First is the size of the community.  A P&P game is typically played amongst a handful of people who know each other in real life.  If you act like a jerk, you’re going to feel the consequences pretty quickly.  A MMORPG is played among thousands of people who have no connection outside the game, and don’t even know each others’ real names.  Think of the difference between being rude at the office where you work, and being rude to random people on the streets of a big city; the former is much more likely to get you in trouble.<br>
<br>
Second, people in a P&P game can control who inhabits their world.  If someone acts like a jerk to people in a P&P game, pretty soon he won’t be invited back.  As a result, a regular P&P group is likely to consist of people who not only know each other, but who tend to have similar ideas about what is and is not fun roleplaying.  In a MMORPG, you have no control over who else logs on.  Sure, theoretically you could get someone banned, but that’s much harder to do than just agreeing that Bob is a jerk and not inviting him over the next time you play D&D.<br>
<br>
Actually, I wonder if you don’t have the causal relationship backwards.  Instead of the absence of PvP leading to a lack of accountability, I think it’s the lack of accountability that’s lead to the absence of PvP.  Game designers have come to realize that if you set people loose in a virtual world with the ability to kill each other, and without some mechanism to create consequences for killing people, the results aren’t pretty.  Consider the history of the industry since UO’s release and the resulting gankfest (from what I’ve read, I didn’t play): the introduction of penalties for PK’ing and then a new UO world without PvP; the release of AC and EQ largely without PvP; and a great deal of effort given to assuring people that future PvP systems will be different because there will be consequences for wanton PK’ing.  Designers seem to view accountability is a prerequisite for robust PvP, not the other way around.<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually, if the Server AI is making the decisions (e.g., controlling the dragon), then what you really have is a failure of PvE, not PvP, correct?  After all, you've replaced the human controlling the dragon (or the bandits, or whatever) with AI.  <br>
<br>
If it is true that Server AI cannot replace the human intelligence, then doesn't this make allowing the potential conflict between player-controlled characters even more important, to supply that human element that is missing?   <br>
<br>
As I stated above, PvP in pen and paper RPGs is NOT limited to players vs. GM...it also includes players vs. player.  Remember, by PvP, I mean conflict between human-controlled characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Just because there is a person controlling (somewhat) the actions of the NPC doesn't make it PvP.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, it does. It's conflict between human controlled characters (which I am careful to state in my lead paragraph).   And there's no &quot;somewhat&quot; about the GM-controlled characters.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;The GM has certain rough rules of behavior to follow with each NPC.&quot;<br>
<br>
As do the players, if they are role playing.  If they're not role playing, it's not an RPG, is it?  And I am limiting my discussion to RPGs.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Take GM events for instance, they are *not* pvp even though both sides of the conflict are controlled by humans. The NPCs in GM events are following a set script with a small amount of variation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, it's PvP. See my definition of PvP above.  I don't want to get tied up in nomenclature...it's conflict between human-controlled characters that forms the core of pen and paper RPGs.<br>
<br>
GMs are not bound by &quot;set scripts&quot; any more than players.  The GM is supposed to be playing those characters according to their roles, reacting to what the players do or say as if the GM were those characters.  And THAT is exactly what the players are doing with their characters...acting in role.  <br>
<br>
Of course, if your GMs have never acted like this, have never given life to your encounters in the game, then you have my sympathies.  Your pen and paper RPG experience has been sub-par, IMO.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;PvP is about killing other players that have about the same options you do. NPCs are not groomed and lvl'd and equipped, they are simply spawned (created).&quot;<br>
<br>
PvP is about conflict between human controlled characters.  Human conflict is at the core of nearly all of the best stories out there, whether in novel, movie, or some other form.  There are some exceptions, but rare.<br>
<br>
With your reference to spawning of NPCs, I think you've jumped back to MMORPGs, correct?  If so, you are making my point for me.  The NPCs in a pen and paper game are created by the GM to add life to the adventure (if you had a GM that did nothing more than roll dice to create something to kill with no interaction with you, then you have my pity, as I said above).  Even more important than the way they are created, is the way they are CONTROLLED.  A good GM will add that element to an encounter even with 1d12 randomly rolled kobolds.  <br>
<br>
And yes, you are right that that is what is missing in the PvE element of MMORPGs.  All the more reason not to eliminate the PvP element.<br>
 <br>

EQ is so scewed in terms of hp of npc mobs that it makes it difficult to have realistic battles... Also, the pipe sizes of most connections probably would not be able to handle the load.<br>

<br>
I would go even further though -- I think you CANNOT have an effective MMRPG without a <b>meaningful</b> PvP option (meaningful = well thought out, balanced, and effective, i.e. not EQ).  Without meaningful PvP, you dig yourself into a corner and it gets harder and harder to maintain player interest.  Meaningful PvP helps the players govern themselves, form communities, and test their abilities not against some dumb AI which can be defeated using a standard cookie-cutter method, but against a live human being who doesn't need a server patch to change his reaction.<br>
<br>
As Scirocco pointed out, in the pen & paper games the DM controls the actions of each of the non-player characters, which gives the game the same sort of excitement as a PvP game.  Since this is typically impossible in a MMRPG, PvP is the answer.<br>
<br>
I know that after EQ, I will never again experiment with a MMRPG that doesn't offer a meaningful PvP option -- and I doubt any software developers will write one. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://lag999.homestead.com/files/biggrin.gif width=15 height=15 BORDER=0> at: 7/6/01 5:02:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleana2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leana 2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/6/01 5:28:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> Without getting into a serious discussion there’s a simplified way to look at this.<br>

I think that most players like to test themselves against other RL players.  In EQ you test yourself against other players all the time.  You just test yourself by judging your accomplishments against theirs.  How fast did you get to 50?  What gear are you wearing?  Have you ever soloed the Dino in OOT?  The only thing missing is the head-to-head fight that only leaves one person breathing at the end.<br>
<br>
UO left a nasty taste in the mouths of the MMORPG player base pertaining to PvP.   I come from an Meridian 59 background, and I can tell you for certain... Good PvP adds a great deal of dimension to an online RPG.  With good PvP there are times when your pulse will pound, your fingers will shake on the keyboard, and you will die a little when your character is slain by that cheese eating bastard that snuck in behind you.<br>
<br>
I miss PvP, and I agree with the &quot;S&quot; man, a little spice adds a lot, and too much ruins the whole dish.<br>
<br>
I also like the looks of DAoC.  Limited PvP, and the topper for me is the fact that the PvP has a purpose.  You don’t kill just cause you’re more leet than the other character your killing.  You kill for realm points and relics to help your realm.<br>
<br>
In closing let me say this.  EQ is a GREAT game.  It broke ground in many ways, and made many of the games getting ready to come out possible by showing that a MMORPG could be a huge success.  The only two things that could have made EQ better would be these:<br>
<br>
1:  A more balanced PvP system.  By this I mean better geography to promote PvP while not letting it run amok.  More equanimity between classes and their ability to kill.  More equanimity between groups of lower players Vs. a higher level character.<br>
<br>
2:  Better customer relations.  More CS reps, a more defined set of rules, just better relations across the board.<br>

<br>
 &quot;And by PvP, I mean human conflict...conflict between human-controlled characters.&quot;<br>
<br>
 I understand that this is what _you_ mean when you say 'PvP', but I wonder how many folks accept this definition.  I certainly don't.  To me, 'PvP' means &quot;player versus player conflict&quot;.  I don't consider GMs as players.  I agree that PnP RPGs often have interparty conflict, but I think only in an extreme minority would one be able to say such a game is &quot;based on&quot; this sort of interaction.  It seems to me that most PnP games are mostly PvE.<br>
<br>
 Aside: Rules Lawyers are PvV, substitute V with GM, the game's name, etc. ;)<br>
<br>
 On the other hand, I'll likely play DAoC and participate in the PvP there (after level 30, right?).  I _like_ cooperative games, lots.  And there are _tons_ of competitive games out there already.  It sometimes annoys me how the fricking realtime crowd insists that _all_ games be realtime.  Well, I want some turnbased games, darnit.  It sometimes annoys me how the fricking multiplayer crowd insists that _all_ games have multiplayers.  Well, I like single player-focused games, sometimes.  Etc. with PvP vs PvE. ;)<br>

<br>
GMs are as much participants of the game as the people you refer to as &quot;players.&quot;  And since participants of games are players of the game, by definition, GMs ARE players.  <br>
<br>
Don't get caught up in the nomenclature.  In the online world, people distinguish between PvP and PvE.  What is the REAL difference between the two?  One is HI controlled, one is AI controlled.  That's all.<br>
<br>
Would it make you feel better to use the term HCCvHCC (human controlled character)?<br>
<br>
BTW, PvV is a form of indirect PvP.  Verant is responding to what players do by making changes in the game design, including the actions of the AI.  <br>
<br>
My point in bringing this up is to respond to the knee-jerk reaction many people have to the presence of HCCvHCC in MMORPGs (most people do call it PvP).  What they don't realize is that HCCvHCC is THE basis of a P&amp;P RPG.  Most people don't have a problem with it in the latter, and in fact, without the HCCvHCC (or PvP), most people wouldn't play them.   How many successful P&amp;P one-person RPGs do you know of?<br>
<br>
Here's what RPGs are missing: immediacy and accountability.  Many people playing these games still, at some level, don't really think of the fact that there is a real human being behind that other character.  The other person isn't sitting across the table.  And there are many who take the advantage of causing grief to another human being for the pleasure of it, and do so because they feel they cannot be held accountable for it.  Or they feel that whatever accounting will be made will be relatively insignificant.<br>

<br>
A GM is not the players enemy.  The GM is there to create encounters and to enforce the rules.  To this end, the GM will control NPCs to oppsose the players.  Many of the NPCs are created for the sole purpose of dieing to the PCs.  The GM spawns these NPCs as needed.<br>
<br>
Most PnP games do not have much, or encourage any PvP.  Player conflict tends to be the death of a PnP game, since the GM cannot divide his time between two teams operating seperately, and without controlling one side of the conflict, cannot guide the story along.<br>
<br>
When Players decide the game is not PvE, but rather PvGM, the only action players can take is to quit.<br>
<br>
Verant is a GM, not a player.  They have to divide their attention between thousands of players over hundreds of simultaneous encounters.  Since this would be an impossible task to accomplish manually, they have automated the process.  They set the rules in stone (as opposed to most GMs who bend or break rules in the interest of the story).  And with a divided player base, PvP is a possibility between players.<br>

Players don't.&quot;<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter.  They're both actively participating in the game, controlling characters in the game, and hopefully playing those characters according to their respective roles.<br>
<br>
All you are pointing out is a difference in the power of the participants.  Why is that relevant?  Moreover, you overlook the fact that there can be a similar difference in the power of the &quot;players&quot; (the non-GMs).  Not to mention the fact that a player in a P&amp;P RPG DOES have the power to change the world in a sentence just as much as a GM.  <br>
<br>
A GM and a player are not that different, since the interactive storytelling that is a RPG requires the mutual consent and cooperation of everyone involved.  <br>
<br>
A GM says, &quot;Lightning comes out of the sky and kills all your characters.&quot;  The players are free to say, &quot;No it doesn't, we continue to ride along.&quot;  Why?  Because it's all in their imaginations.   Without the mutual consent of the &quot;players,&quot; it doesn't matter what the GM says.  <br>
<br>
It works the other way, too, of course.   The players say, &quot;We swing our swords and kill all 100 orcs at once.&quot;  The GM says, &quot;Sorry, 99 of them are still alive.&quot;  Once again, mutual consent is needed.<br>
<br>
A GM can only change the world with a sentence if all the other participants in the RPG consent to it.  A &quot;player&quot; can do the same thing as well, if all the other participants consent.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;A GM is not the players enemy.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never used the word &quot;enemy.&quot;  Why do you?  Just because some other human is controlling a character that your conflict is in conflict with doesn't make them your enemy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;The GM is there to create encounters and to enforce the rules. To this end, the GM will control NPCs to oppose the players.&quot;<br>
<br>
Too restrictive, and you're wrong.  A GM controls characters called &quot;NPCs&quot; to INTERACT with the CHARACTERS controlled the non-GM humans playing the game (&quot;players&quot;).  The fact that you use the word &quot;oppose&quot; indicates to me that your RPGing experience must be somewhat limited.  The fact that you refer to the NPCs opposing the PLAYERS (and not characters) indicates to me that you may not even be roleplaying, and thus we're talking apples and oranges.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Many of the NPCs are created for the sole purpose of dieing to the PCs. The GM spawns these NPCs as needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
So what?  They're stilled HUMAN CONTROLLED.  That's the key distinction you're missing.  <br>
<br>
You're just making my point for me.  Every P&amp;P RPG is based on conflict between HUMAN CONTROLLED CHARACTERS.<br>
<br>
As for their sole purpose being &quot;dying to the PCs,&quot; I repeat my comments above. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Most PnP games do not have much, or encourage any PvP. &quot;<br>
<br>
You miss the point again.  I am not talking about MMORPGs &quot;encouraging&quot; PvP or having &quot;much&quot; PvP  (now using your definition of PvP as conflict between the characters controlled by non-GMs).  Where did you get the idea?<br>
<br>
Even apart from the core conflict between human controlled characters (controlled by the GM and the &quot;players&quot;), ALL P&amp;P RPGs have the possibility and potential of conflict between characters controlled by the &quot;players&quot; (meaning non-GMs) .  Every single one of them.  <br>

The distinction is not between PvP, PvGM, PvV or what not.<br>
<br>
It's between "human intelligence" and "artificial intelligence".  Scirocco's thesis is that old-style AD&D always pitted the participants against human intelligence, much in the same way PvP in modern MMRPGs pits players against human intelligence.  I see no flaws in that thesis.<br>
<br>
Human intelligence is always preferable over artificial intelligence.  Artificial intelligence is just a crutch when the game designer can't supply enough human intelligence to satisfy the gamers (mainly due to their relative numbers).  If the game designer wants a game targeted to the serious, long-term player interested in a deep and involved world, he or she should strive to make the ratio of AI to HI as low as possible.  EQ, unfortunately, has done precisely the opposite. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaaroan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaroan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/7/01 9:21:02 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/foolthatspeaks/bartxxx.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EVERY P&amp;P RPG is based on PvP</span><hr size=1> - accountiblity can be accomplished by having kos lists where that kos(kos to that guild or to you) appears with in line of sight.<br>

 &quot;It's between &quot;human intelligence&quot; and &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;.

<br>
 If this is Scirocco's thesis, then I have to disagree with it.  I _don't_ think that old-style AD&amp;D is much the same as PvP in modern MMRPGs.  If someone wants to change the words and say something like HCCvHCC, hey, that's fine.  And I'm happy to call AD&amp;D that.  But HCCvHCC != PvP, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
 I guess, from my point of view, I think of GMs (or Verant) as &quot;referees&quot;.  The referee in a football game is _not_ a player, for example.  We used to say, as players, that we're &quot;playing in a campaign&quot; or &quot;running [a character] in a campaign&quot;.  As a GM, I never said this.  I'd say that I was &quot;running a campaign&quot; (note the lack of &quot;in&quot;).<br>
<br>
 This is an interesting discussion, but it hinges upon agreeing to a definition some of us are unwilling to accept, methinks. ;)<br>

The thesis is not "PvP = AD&D DM".  The thesis is that in both styles of play, you are pitted against a human-controlled conflict.  Whether the conflict is in the form of orcs, kobolds, and ogres (AD&D) or other online players (MMRPG), the key is that you are not just up against a computer-controlled AI.
