The goal is to have, in 1 week's time, a concise list of problems with the Trakanon rotation, and potential solutions for them.<br>

REMEMBER!  The system in place must be good enough to EVERYONE that all are willing to abide by it.  Keep in mind that if there is no good solution, it means the rotation will likely become FCFS.  Also keep in mind that that FCFS is also a valid option, and CAN work if people are willing to respect each other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujasiofneriak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jasi of Neriak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 10:11:00 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ang.mux.net/smjasi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Trakanon</span><hr size=1> I honestly do not know enough about the Trakanon Rotation to state a clear opinion.

Some of you may have been in chat with Oribi when the servers just started to go mad. She said that Brell was a great server.. one thing she noticed was that she never had to deal with Guilds fighting over eachother over spawns.. guess that will stop once Trak becomes FFA and more and more people get closer to 60.<br>

Hrm,<br>
<br>
I was just talking to a friend of mine who plays on another server.  On that server, three guilds monopolize Trak...<br>
<br>
BUT, what the guilds have instituted is that every 4th Trak spawn is &quot;open&quot; ... if another guild gets in and kills him, great!  Once a guild has killed Trak 3x on the &quot;open spawn&quot; then that guild gets added to the rotation, and every 5th Trak is now open season.  He belongs to a guild who just killed them for the third time, and just got put on the rotation.<br>
<br>
I haven't had much time to digest this, but my first thought is that it seems like it works pretty well on a &quot;guild only&quot; basis... the problem is one of the strenghs of Brell is our &quot;we are all members of the same community&quot; mentality.  But perhaps some similar modified system could be put in place in order to prevent total fcfs on this dragon.<br>

Lock the sign ups and when all on it have finished then its FCFS.<br>
<br>
He's only needed for VP keys and the ones that could go to VP and not get slaughtered are the ones who would be able to kill him on a FCFS system.  It will just end up like VS list if the list is kept.  More and more guilds will sign up till you have 30+ guilds on the list.  The fighting over this will be worse than VS since guilds will have to wait 10 weeks at a time just to get a few teeth.  It will takes months and months to get enough teeth for the guild.   With FCFS the strongest, and the ones suited to be in VP, will get their keys first and then not bother with him anymore, and that will allow the next tier to move up and take him down.<br>
<br>
BP's he drops aren't really needed since you can get equal or better BP's in PoG or any of the Velious quests or even drops in West Wastes.<br>
<br>
<br>
The top guilds shared him before he was scheduled, they will do the same if he is removed.  I doubt Watchers and SR will show up in the zone and fight over him.  They just did joint Dain and VS raids so obviously they know how and do talk with each other and work things out in game.<br>

(though I'd put the cleric epic as more useful in all, especially for raids)<br>
<br>
The Velious BP has what? Mark of Karn? or Super nerfed Celestial Elixir, not even in the same Ballpark for usefulness.<br>
<br>
Unless I'm mistaken, Trak's a 3 day spawn, with 2 indy's and (at least) 1 small guild out of 14 on the list currently.  It's fairly obvious that guilds are not rushing to jump onto this list at any high rate of speed (wasn't it 7 guilds in november?), and the turn over rate is still under 2 months even in a worst case scenario.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to see, if a change is warranted, a list system, much like Adune's 18 person idea from awhile back, but a bit harsher, perhaps for Trak requiring 24 people 53(55?)+ and any guild represented by the people on the list counts as a joint raid, ie, if guild A produced 12 people, pulled 6 from guild B, 3 from guild C, 2 from guild D, and 1 from guild E to form their list, that it be considered a joint  Guild's A-E raid.  <br>
<br>
That alone should chop down the list a bit, as well as keeping any signups honest.<br>

There's currently 14 people on the rotation.  Outside of a couple indy's and MAYBE 1 or 2 guilds, it looks like the majority of people on the list will be able to take him down with ease, and with a majority of the participants being from their own guild.  While the &quot;ubers&quot; might have to wait a little longer (1 to 1.5 months) to kill him, that's the consequence of an aging population under a rotation system.  If it gets above 25 people, or if people start signing up that honestly wouldn't have a shot at him, then I'd say do something.  It's nowhere near out of hand at the moment, so I'd say let it be.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 2473<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 10:37:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Trakanon</span><hr size=1> I think trak should be handled like what adun mentioned in the vox/nagafen thread.  Take off the rotation...let's get a forum in here for the here and now..not to go past one week.<br>
<br>
People say this hasn't become as bad as VS.  Newsflash guys..why would we want to even build up to that again?  We nearly lost (still in debate we'll see who really abides by it once this is set up) the reservation system over VS.  Why even set ourselves up for another blow up on trak later?  more and more people are growing up to do it and already there is a 1 month wait.  I think lock the current reservation on trak and then start with the new forum that encourages people work together. If for some reason this doesn't work, then things can always be brought up for change.  I'd say to add criteria in order to even participate in the forum but something tells me that would just bring on more fights as to what criteria we'd use.  I think most people that have even signed up for the planes that obviously had no clue, ended up not signing up for them again.  They learned how hard it really was. <br>

Consensus from the guild meet was: Yes, most prefer Trak on Rotation.  But all agreed that there had to be some kind of limit, or requirement to get on the trak list.

We observed on trak that there was still contention around what to do with trak...not that there was a consensus.<br>
<br>
Also, no where was it ever even given as an idea an alternate way of doing things other than a list.  I'm sure you may have had people's attention with that.  If this came up, it was due after the 3.5 - 4 hours that we stayed.<br>

I guarantee you if you go back to a list type setting you will have problems and why would you want to repeat such a  thing?<br>

<br>
We have successfully organized and completed raids of 4 or more groups, in such various places as Hate, Fear, the Hole, and CoM. These raids were supplemented by friends of ours from other Guilds, as well as a few folk who signed up in the hope they would go.<br>
<br>
In about 2 months, we will all be of sufficient level and gear to take down Trakanon. We will accomplish this by supplementing our raid with numerous friends, and a few folk who sign up in the hope they can go.<br>
<br>
Why do we want to take down Trak? Well, regardless of Twiggies opinion, many of our members place great value on the BP he drops. By hosting the raid as a Guild, we can insure that our idea of loot fairness is enforced, we can insure that all of our members can attend, and we get the thrill of leading a raid on a Dragon (something I happen to enjoy). Our odds of obtaining a Trak BP for a Guild member are increased, by virtue of having all of our members attending the raid.<br>
<br>
It would take me about a week to organize a 6 person raid, given the size of our Guild, and all of our friend's schedules. And, the extra time to prepare, do research and planning, etc. improves our odds of success. Having open sign-ups, as we do now for Dragons and Planes, allows me to fill any class/lvl gaps I may have.<br>
<br>
So, if Trak is FCFS (FFA, same difference, trust me, I have chars on other servers) who will be able to kill him? Only those few Guilds that have around 25 or so level 55+ members (the rest can be recruited on spur of the moment).<br>
<br>
Truthfully, without some type of list, Epiphany will never be able to host a Trak raid.<br>
<br>
My personal vote on this matter is to leave the schedule as is.<br>
<br>

PS I do feel strongly that the concept of an Indy sponsored Dragon raid needs to be re-examined. 1 of 19 slots for Vox are Indy, 4 of 37 fer Naggy, and 2 of 14 fer Trak. Why? Well, Trak has the best loot table, then Naggy, then Vox <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And as numerous Indy's have proved, all ya have to do is post, and people will come.<br>
If, for whatever reason, you don't wish to join a Guild or start your own, then IMHO you forfeit the right to reserve the only 3 mobs that we have server-wide lists for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 2481<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 2:56:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Trakanon</span><hr size=1> Klug, <br>
Adun's proposal on the vox/naggy thread made allowances for it not to be fcfs.  Just because we don't do the list way doesn't mean it still has to be fcfs.  I am too lazy to go back to vox/naggy thread to pull it out but the gist of adun's proposal as I understand it is that weekly people can sign up to take trak under a &quot;forum&quot;..and then they work together.  <br>
<br>
So Epiphany under whatever rules for this forum says..hey..we have about 15 members ready to take trak down this week and we have 5 friends or so.  We will need another 10 to 15, what guild would like to join us? Or maybe you go ahead and see someone else is interested and you say..hey let's split it.  It is just for that raid.  Something has to give in the system on these &quot;reservable&quot; mobs.  Let's look at my guild for example.  If we signed up for a trak raid and we saw 2 other guilds that had the same interest, I'd like to think that we would work it out with them.  We'd choose from our guild who would go...and the same thing from the other two if they wanted to &quot;share&quot; that week.  We obviously wouldn't even bring friends if we were going to discount guildmates because our guildmates will always come first. <br>
<br>
This way you don't necessarily have to wait a whole month to go...you may end up..but you may not.  This clearly gets rid of lists that last 10 months and promotes unity between the guilds in the community.  You can sure tell who is trying to monopolize the spawn...it should be tracked.<br>
<br>
I think no one would disagree that trak is ok right now..but it will become bad as people grow up in the game and that isn't too far off into the future.  We have seen this list idea hurt the vox/naggy as well as VS.  By the time vox/naggy come around, some guilds have even outgrown the mob and some other guilds are just going through the motions because their name is up there even though the person who had passion to do such a raid is gone from the guild.  That guild wouldn't have probably even remained on the rotation if it were a current weekly thing.<br>
<br>
Why I ask would anyone want to do it for trak just because?  The end result has been proven that with a list system, you will sign up and you MAY get to it in 8 months.  Doesn't sound right to me.  Let's come up with some forum rules that go by weekly only and work out something. <br>
<br>
Believe me Klug, i used to think the list idea was the most fair.  Since I've read a lot of people's post (some with a grain of salt), I am starting to see the frustration they are feeling. I myself am not necessarily frustrated but if we allow a system to be too frustrating, it won't be in business for long. <br>

Just say no to lists <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utwiggietymberwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twiggie Tymberwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 808<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 3:36:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Trakanon</span><hr size=1> While I agree with you Klug on that it would be nice for your guild to do a Trak raid ... what about the 30+ other guilds out there that will have 16 members over 55+ in the next few months?  Should they be added to the list?  This is EXACTLY how Venril Sathir started.  It was SR/Watchers/LoH/Enshadowed and a few others rotating on a small list.  Then a few guilds got added, then a few more, and a few more, and more and more and more till we had a year wait.  Trak list in 3 to 6 months will look like VS list did.<br>
