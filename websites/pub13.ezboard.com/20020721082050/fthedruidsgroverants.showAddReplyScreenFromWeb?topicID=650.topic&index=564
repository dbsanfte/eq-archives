I keep hearing that you are not trying to impugne on other classes raid benefits and spells with this petition. But by changing the balances on damage dealing, DoTs and Healing you are doing exactly that. Not to mention the post-raid ramifications. If you get the group healing that you are asking for then Wave of Prexus becomes obselete. If you get the improvement in Direct healing---Divine Light becomes Obselete. If you get the DoT you are asking for certain Necro and Shaman DoTs become obselete. Heal over time.....Celestial Elixir goes bye bye. DD upgrade....Mages become third in nuking? That will be well accepted Im sure. <br>
<br>
Get some focus, decide what you REALLY must have to be a &quot;neccessity&quot; on a raid (which is rediculous every class is needed on a raid), and go for it. This petition is a gigantic wish list that will turn so-called class balance on its ear. <br>

<br>
Druids have been underpowered, stated in the petition.<br>
<br>
The only way we can make something up is through experience.  Using AA skills and such we come up to PAR with our other comrades (crits nukes, heals, insta evacs, charm pets).<br>
<br>
We can solo certain places to get armor that will make us better.  This will again, bring us up to PAR with other classes.<br>
<br>
I've always strived to be the best I could, and even though I'm a really good druid - I'm just a druid.  I am a good healer in HoT, and a smart nuker.<br>
<br>
What makes me mad, even angry, is the fact that we have to kick our ass just to get up to the level of everyone else, even though we (in some cases) play exceptionally. <p><font color="#006600"><font size=+1>Baron Quigsby Quickfoot</font></font>

<br>
1 or 2 shamans is alot of shamans on a raid ;P<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You just made my point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Basically because our DoTing hasn't had an upgrade since level 53 and the 1250ish damage that Winged Death deals to mobs on those raids where we get to use them, is neglible. Even in group situations, the damage for Winged Death is less and less useful. For slightly less mana I can simply nuke the mob almost as much and have no worries that my damage will be reduced because the mob died before the DoT finished.<br>
<br>
When I first got WD and until level 59, Winged Death was a very viable and useful alternative to Nuking, even if it didn't completely finish its duration, its ratio was nicer than my Nukes by a significant amount.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Just because you haven't gotten an upgrade doesn't mean you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and upgrade. Shamans don't get an upgrade to their slow spell after level 51,clerics don't get an upgrade to annul magic after level 53, enchanters don't get an upgrade to theft of thought after level 51, etc. Wildfire has a dmg/mana ratio of 3.2. How high would you have to raise the ratio on your dots before you use them over your nukes? Keep in mind bane of nife has a ratio of 3.8 if the mob takes full damage and 3.28 if the mob is not rooted or feared. Your best nuke is already comparable to the best shaman dot if the mob isn't rooted, feared, or engaged in melee.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &gt;&gt; I will never compare myself as ahead of a druid in healing ability. If a druid thinks I have more healing ability, that druid doesn't know how to play their class. (remember: my mana pool is *trivial* compared to a druid. I think my wisdom is regularly around 110 - 120 based on what I'm wearing.) &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
First of all, in many situations you are a better healer than I am. You can cast a nice group heal, and if need be Mod down much more than I can because you have 1000 to 1500 more HP than I do, and continue doing that group heal. You can also spot heal with great efficiency thanks to CC.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You missed his point completely. For the specific role of healing a full group on an AE encounter, a paladin can counter AE damage better than a druid can. For general, all purpose healing, a druid is far superior. This was an ability that was given to paladins specifically to give them a role in raids. It is essentially the only role we fill successfully due to having lower damage output than any melee class besides bards. Druids have many roles they can fill successfully on raids. <br>
<br>
That is the point I have been trying to explain this whole time. You can successfully heal, being the 2nd best raid healer in the game, and healing power stacks. You can successfully nuke, being the 3rd best raid nuker, and nuking stacks. You can debuff FR/AC/atk with debuffs that stack with all other classes (this role itself isn't a stackable role). You can buff resists with the best persistant FR/CR resist buffs (again, the role itself doesn't stack). You can buff ac/hp/mana (this role doesn't stack, and is optional). You can provide convenience in the form of ports to and from raids. You can provide convenience by succoring to zone to invite for CoH. In short, you have many valid roles to play on a raid. Some of these roles are vital to the success of a raid. Any time you are facing a fire or cold based AE, you need want a druid. Against Luclin high AC mobs, the AC debuff combined with bard AC debuffs substantially help melee damage output. Any time there aren't enough clerics you have a vital role. Any time there aren't enough nukers, you have a vital role.  <br>
<br>
I think you have much more of a role on raids than you think you do, especially compared to most other classes. Druids have at least some role on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> raid, unlike many other classes. If it is a completely MR mob, your mages and wizzies are twiddling their thumbs. Druids can at least contribute healing and buffing. If it is a mob with super high AC, melees are just window dressing while druids can provide nukes. Name me one raid mob that a druid can't contribute anything at all. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I, and I'm sure 99% of the druids on this board would agree, have absolutely no problem, argument, or complaint with giving Clerics a healing boost to keep them &quot;ahead&quot; of Druids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, you miss the point. Fine, upgrade druids's healing power, then upgrade cleric's healing power to compensate. Guess what? Now VI has to upgrade the damage output on mobs to accomodate those changes. There is a reason the high end mobs have the damage output they do.<br>
<br>
I don't have anything against druids, nor do I think there should be some penalty for the ability to solo at all levels without nice equipment. I just happen to think that druids are pretty well balanced right now. I wholeheartedly agree with the request for a single target PoTG, that is a convenience, not a shift in the classes power. With this petition, you are asking for things that will infringe upon the roles of several other classes, classes which have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> secondary role to fall back on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugraalthedorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graal the Dorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/11/02 2:40:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=576>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Power of the Druid..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So you are saying if i am 60 with resists i will never take AE damage? cuz otherwise the scenario is still intact.

Resists will not eliminate damage, but they will reduce it significantly on AEs that are not unresistable. Get your resists up to about 150 or so unbuffed and you will generally take about half damage over time from AEs in HoT.

"Its way to wide ranged. What are you guys looking for?<br>
<br>
I though it was to get you into Raids and groups better.<br>
<br>
Let me say right now I am a shaman and you know what my problem probably is....DOT<br>
<br>
Why does a druid need a DOT almost as good as a Necro or Shaman? DOT have nothing absolutely nothing to do with getting into raids or groups. You never use DOTs unless your soloing and if I do use a DOT in an XP group its not my strongest because it never does full damage.<br>
<br>
Everything else in your petition does improve your raid/grouping ie ports, heals, POTG.<br>
<br>
I have seen "Why do you care Druids DOT stack with Shaman"<br>
<br>
It comes down to one word: PRIDE<br>
<br>
Shamans are the masters of the DOT and IMO better than necros. We should be. Necros have a stronger pet.<br>
<br>
Druids are the Master of nothing. You have a wide range of spells. <br>
<br>
Your DD's should never exceed no more than 60-70 percent of a Wiz.<br>
<br>
Your DS should not be as good as a Mage<br>
<br>
and your DOT should not be as good as Shaman's or Necros.<br>
<br>
Lets realistically look at a "regular Shamans" best DOT. Bane of Nife (56). Even this spell costs around 15k but is attainable. It does 1645 total damage if the target isnt moving and the dd portion hits. If druids want a new DOT it should not exceed 65-70 percent of BON damage so around 1071 Damage.<br>
<br>
Where you got the 1900+ I am guessing you are looking at our Ancient Spell which sorry to say I ultra ultra ultra rare. Even that only does a little over 2k so a druid equivelent Ancient DOT would be about 1500 damage.<br>
<br>
What I am trying to get at is VI made druids to have the widest variety of spells at a lesser degree. What everyone has a problem is your trying to get over that 60-65 percent "as effective" rate that VI has seem to set. (Just compare your DD's to Wiz and DOTs etc)<br>
<br>
Take a look at the clerics AOE heal how much does it heal. Knock off 65 percent and thats what your aoe heal spell should be.<br>
<br>
Class Balancing should not turn into Class meshing. Everyone needs to know what they are the masters of. if you try to take someones role you will tick off a lot of people.<br>
<br>
Ports Fine<br>
Single Target POTG Fine<br>
Upgrade to heals Fine<br>
AOE Heal Fine if its lesser than the clerics<br>
DOT this has nothing to do with getting groups but fine if its lesser than Shaman/Necro<br>
<br>
In a couple months druids will start complaining about how rare there new DOT spell is and wonder why.<br>

Maybe to level 49?I don't care about ports to Luclin.  That is what the Scions are for.  As to having better buffs, it seems to me that half the time they are wiped by the high level mob anyway.  More effecient if the druid buffs so that the cleric can med heals.<br>
I don't see why we need a mana regen.  When I want mana I politely ask an enchanter or do without.  I am not a cleric, so if they want to pull like I am one then I will save them with an evac and politely explain I am not a cleric.<br>

<br>
Cleric: Words of Vigor (52) AOE Heal for about 550pts<br>
<br>
If druids want a AOE heal it should be around lvl 60 and should be nothing more than a group chloroblast (400 something)<br>
<br>
Shaman: Ancient: Scourge of Knife (60) DOT for 1955pts<br>
<br>
And this is our Ancient spell for gods sakes.  It drops once every blue moon and I have heard they are no drop.<br>
<br>
Realistically<br>
<br>
Shaman: Bane of Knife (56) DOT for 1498pts<br>
<br>
Even some shaman will only have this as there best DOT and this is what I am using at 55 and havent seen BON auction yet (PC is about 15K)<br>
<br>
Shaman: Envenom Bolt (49) DOT for 1022pts<br>
<br>
This spell is boughten.  i do not know what druids intend for there spell but if its store boughten compare to EBolt if you want it rare compare to BON if you want ultra rare compare to Scrouge of Knife.<br>
<br>
Either way Druids in no way should exceed 70 percent damage of other classes just look at your current spell and see if you can catch the trend.<br>

No, they don't turn us away, but they don't notice much if we aren't there either since we have pretty much zero impact on the raid. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

Yes, for the specific role of healing AE encounter damage.  Take a look at the high end encounters.  They allmost all involve AE damage. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

No, you see what these druids are saying to themselves is, &quot;If I can barely keep a group of casters alive here and now..what the hell am I going to do when we start taking on these mobs we're hearing about in NToV and Shissar?&quot;<br>

If we continue down the path druid's have been taken..I'll tell you exactly what they will do. Roll up a monk. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>
