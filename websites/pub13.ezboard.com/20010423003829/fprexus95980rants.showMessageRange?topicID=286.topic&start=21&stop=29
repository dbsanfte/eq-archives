Yay for the GM!<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;But what happened was, McDonald's was superheating the coffee to crazy temperatures to save money in some way; the woman had her flesh burned off and some very serious surgery needed. And, McDonald's had been warned before repeatedly and had not taken corrective action. They were at fault as well. Spilled coffee in your lap should never cause the critical injuries she suffered. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Nuh uh. Having worked at McDonald's at various points in my life since 1983, I can tell you I heard complaints about the coffee not being hot enough and never (and let me repeat--NEVER) received a complaint about coffee being too hot. Also, I worked at McD's in the same city as the McD's in question, but not owned by the same Owner/Operator at the time of the accident. I assure you that McD's does not need to superheat coffee to save money. That claim is spurious. <br>
<br>
Anyone with business sense knows that, yes, controlling food costs and waste is an important element to maximizing profit and assuring quality, but there are bigger more immediate ways to control costs, the main one being labor. I was concerned less about throwing out a pot of old coffee and worrying about saving a few pennies than I was about making sure all my crew people were busy and if they weren't, sending them home as their wage was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  considerably</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more than the few pennies I threw out when food was subpar or prepared with miscalibrated equipment. <br>
<br>
I also read some article where they tested the coffee pot in question and said it ran something like 50 degrees hotter than at home coffee makers (and I see the articles linked make the same claim).  I ran a test myself on the coffee pot we have at home, and it ran the same temperature as the purported temperature of the coffee in question, not the low number they claimed home machines run at. In fact, we now have a NEW coffee machine, I'll try to remember to take the temperature of this bad boy too.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I talked to a doctor at one of those ask a doctor places on AOL about what constitutes &quot;scalding&quot; and if scalding can cause second or third degree burns (the answer was, ambiguously, &quot;yes&quot;) and how many seconds does &quot;scalding&quot; liquid need to be on the skin for it to cause third degree burns and at what temperature a &quot;scald&quot; could occur. I don't remember the details, I'll have to research again, but I'm fairly certain the temperature falls within the so-called &quot;industry standard range&quot; of 140-150 degrees and can happen within seconds. Being somewhat of a liability in the kitchen when dealing with hot dishes/liquid (I'm not very domestically inclined), I'm slightly familiar with the results of scalding, to my regret. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
In my opinion, based on the &quot;facts&quot; presented in both of these articles, I don't think anyone tested any other coffee machines at all, or tried to test the &quot;industry standard&quot; to see if it was truly standard. While my memory isn't the best, the 180-190 range seemed about right from what I remembered from my training as the proper temperature for the coffee machines, but I was willing to grant that time and old age might have tripped me up, and I was willing to consider that perhaps the range I used to calibrate was closer to 160-180. On a lark, I tested one coffee machine, a home one at that (which is supposed to be run lower), and found it at the alleged &quot;too high&quot; temperature, well within the &quot;too hot&quot; range of 180-190. My husband has never complained about his coffee coming out of the machine as &quot;too hot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm. Something seems fishy to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is a lot like all those quotes people attribute to both Quayle and Bush--just because someone says they said it, doesn't mean they said it. And just because someone says the &quot;standard&quot; is such and such degrees, doesn't mean that's really the standard at all. I've learned that unless I test it for myself, I regard these &quot;factual&quot; claims with skepticism. Maybe others can test the temperature of their home coffee machines too and we can establish an informal average and see for ourselves what's really what. Maybe I just had a wacky coffee pot and a wacky husband with an iron mouth that doesn't get scalded.<br>
<br>
Gotta love the scientific method. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Kattria, yes something is fishy - it's the common myth about the story everyone repeats. &quot;Oh ouch she got a little hot cofferm her own fault and sues for millions.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've read the story in legal journals, I've heard legal professionals discuss it independantly on various occassions; on every occassion it was  the general public or the media with some pundit, it's the &quot;crazy lawsuit&quot; story, and with every informed person it was the &quot;justified lawsuit&quot; story.

<br>
OK.  On monday, Feb.9, I was happening to pass through Kithicor, when I noticed a General V'ghera raid going on.  I asked the raid leader if it was possible I could join in with my rogue, and he said yes (Dysdain knows what he's doing, I didnt want to pass up the opportunity).  At the beginning of the raid, and a couple points during the raid, he made it fairly clear that only the rogues were to look at corpses until they looted what they needed for the quest.<br>
<br>
After the first rogues went (Mydnight lost her pouch due to a bad hand in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    sorry hun, send me a tell if you need help), it was my turn.  General V'ghera was pulled to the group and dispatched without much trouble.  My group did not get the kill, however, the raid leader's group did.  Since there were no other SKs on the raid, he told a level 18 SK that she could loot the shield.  I stood over the corpse until it became available, and the next message I saw was &quot;Someone is already looting that corpse.&quot;  I look over to see the SK looting it.  After about 30 seconds of her being down on the corpse, and a few /taps by me, I see her stand up, and the corpse disappear.  She had looted the General's pouch (what I needed for the quest).  I shouted across to zone to make sure everyone was aware of the situation.  Several people petitioned, and the only thing we got from the GM's that night was &quot;Im sorry there is nothing we can do.&quot;<br>
<br>
That night, I sent several emails out.  One was to the supervisor of the GM i talked to that night.  Another was to Jill Henderson, and another was to VI technical support.  I called VI customer service and got several peices of information, including email addresses and what time people would be in the office/online/etc.  The night after the incident, I /petitioned to talk to the head GM of the server (Zrinic).  After a while, he sent me a /tell saying that he forwarded the email to JIll Henderson, and that it usually takes 24 hours for her to respond.  After 24 hours had passed, I still had no response.  So I /petitioned again, waited 3 hours, got no response, and /petitioned again (my first petition had been taken off the Queue...I stayed in Rivervale the whole time during this).  I finally got another /tell from Zrinic saying, &quot;After reviewing your case with Jill Henderson, we cannot reimburse you.&quot;  He went on to say that basically, they needed some kind of proof that it had happened....more specifically, a /report that someone had said that Airamwu was only supposed to loot the sheild and nothing else.  He then said that Ms. Henderson had sent me an email stating their views on this issue.  <br>
<br>
I proceeded to read the email on another computer, and read that if the person who looted it can confess to intentionally looting, then yes they can reimburse me.  I knew that Airamwu would, because she said she would...Airamwu stayed online with me for several hours, admitting that she had screwed up...thinking that I had already looted my quest item.  So, I asked her to sign on Airamwu (she was on her alt at the time).  I had her send a tell to Zrinic, stating what she had done.  The next thing I saw was &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BY THE GODS&quot; and I was in the GM room in Qeynos Catacombs.  He sat us down, and had us both tell him what happened.  He basically told her that she needs to be more careful in the future, then said, &quot;In order to reimburse Peileii, we are going to have to suspend you for 7-10 days.&quot;  She concurred, saying that the punishment was fitting.  She was then taken off the server, Zrinic gave me the pouch, and Translocated me back to Rivervale...(I have to admit that I turned up the volume on my speakers to hear the joyous music there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )<br>
<br>
All in all, I admire Zrinic for actually listening to my plea, responding, and giving me reasons why (something that the GM monday night did not do)...also that he took the time to hear us out, and ultimately resolve the situation.  I admire Airamwu for fessing up, and for her willingness to take resposibility for her actions, accepting the suspension.  I admire the many friends I have on prexus for not letting me give up.  <br>
<br>
I will say what I put in my guild's MoTD:  &quot;One thing I have learned from this issue with the General's pouch: Never give up, persistance is a virtue.&quot; <br>
<br>

Now there's no hit on the SK at all IMO but for an honest mistake.'<br>
<br>
One thing though, IMO the GM should be able to apply some common sense and see there's no way a killing of the general would legitimately let an SK, 18 or not, loot the pouch. It's well known that's a raid for the rogue to get the pouch.</font><P>Level 59 Conjurer, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>
