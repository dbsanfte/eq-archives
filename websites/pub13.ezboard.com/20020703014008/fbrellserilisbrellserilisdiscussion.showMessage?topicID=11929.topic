Of course, this is going from memory and I may be wrong about some of the minor details, but you can get the idea.<br><br>Irak Altil was the strongest paladin that was cursed to remain in the undead by his peers/temple for his failure in his quest to Cleanse Norrath in the name of Quellious. He was killed in the Plane of Fear and stripped of his equipment as a sign of Evil's power. His equipment, breastplate, shield, and sword were corrupted and Innorouk gave them to his minions as gifts of loyalty. These were Kirak Vil in Nektulos, a thought destroyer in Hate, and the Keeper of the Tombs in the Hole. To remove his curse and allow him to ascend to his god in honor, he must have atonement (from his peers or temple). The holy priest/knight Reklon Gnallen will not grant Irak's atonement for his until Irak's equipment is returned to him without the curse that was placed on it. Of course, only he can cleanse these items. Irak knows this and is wandering the &quot;lands&quot; in search of his equipment to &quot;makeup&quot; or &quot;hide&quot; his failure so that he may be welcome in Lady Quellious' temple again.<br><br>Once you gather Irak's equipment back and have Reklon cleanse them...<br><br>Reklon Gnallen says 'I never thought our order would see these artifacts again. With the return of these relics we can now put at ease a scar upon the history of our order. This cleansing will atone for his failure. Your soul must be pure to have given so freely of yourself. Go now, take this crested token of our order. If you wish to free his soul you must undertake another sacrifice.'<br><br>Reklon Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that symbolizes your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing flames of our lady Quellious. Go now. Thank you . <br><br>You give Irak the crest, which is the temple's sign of forgiveness, and your Fiery Avenger which is your sign of sacrificing yourself for another. Lady Quellious then takes pity on Irak and frees him from his curse. Before he ascends to the fiery consumtion of his cleansing, Lady Quellious gives him the Fiery Defender as a last test of his loyalty and purity to his God and Temple. That test is to sacrifice the &quot;ultimate&quot; weapon of a paladin to another. Irak gives you the Fiery Defender as your reward.<br><br>Mkorpi<br>60 Paladin of Indicium <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufatiger64.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fatiger64</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hey Look its a rare<BR>spawn, lets ki-</span><br>  Posts: 313<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/02 12:04:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11929.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladin / Warrior / Rogue Epic Walk-Through</span><hr size=1> the paladin epic actually sounds like a good story line.<br><br>Luchang <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalaena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talaena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Where's my Tang? </span><br>  Posts: 3521<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/14/02 12:18:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11929.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladin / Warrior / Rogue Epic Walk-Through</span><hr size=1> most of hte epics have a wonderufl backplot to them. 99% of the population (myself included for the druid epic), printed up a walkthrough and just pinpointed the mobs to kill.

It was small enough to conceal under a garment and yet large enough to strike a mortal blow through armor. Aided by vile Teir'Dal enchantments, it is much more fearsome than it appears. I would glady rid myself of it, but I fear I can not until I clear my name with Hanns. <br>&quot;<br><br>To clear Stanos name with hanns, the epic questing rogue pickpockets notes from Founy Jestards and Tani Nmar(rogue GMs) in neriak and kaladim about the assassination. <br><br>&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'I need proof that what I say about Johann is truth, so that Hanns may forgive me. YOU can gather that proof for me. First, travel to Kaladim and Neriak, and there, upon the persons of the rogue guildmasters, you should find that which I seek, two parts of a document I recovered from the dead agent. I entrusted one to Founy, but that trust is gone, and Founy would betray me to Hanns were I to attempt to reclaim it. Tani N'mar has the other, which he should not possess, and keeps it only to spite me, not knowing its real import. Steal them both, and bring them back to me. And don't let anyone follow you! If I am not around, tell Anson you want to see me. &quot;<br><br>Once the fledgling assassin gets the two notes for him, stanos finds out he cannot read it, it must be translated.<br><br>&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'Excellent! With this document I can..' &lt;He pauses for a moment&gt;. 'Damnation! Curse my tired old mind, I forgot that I could not read the document. It is written in some obscure code or language. I can't decipher it, but I know someone who can. Seek out one called Eldreth, an Erudite who used to do work for me. I know not where he may be found these days, only that he will not be found in Erudin, as they want his head for some misdeed in the past. Give him the complete parchment, and tell him I sent you. He owes me. &quot;<br><br>Eldreth charges you 100pp and two bags of milk to translate it.<br><br>But it turns out he cannot fully translate it.<br><br>&quot;Eldreth says 'Hmm, interesting. This document is not only encoded, but written in a very obscure language. From what I can gather, it's a variant of elder Teir'dal, but not one I've encountered. I can not fully translate this, but I know one who can. Find Yendar and give him this <br>&quot;<br><br>The rogue goes to yendar starphyre, a gnomish researcher in steamfont.<br><br>&quot;Yendar Starpyre says 'Oh, if it is written in Elder Teir'Dal, most likely I can translate it. I will be happy to try, in any case. Let me see it, please. <br><br>Yendar Starpyre says 'I say, this is indeed a challenge. This is written in what I'm sure is the language of the High Priesthood of Innoruuk. I've often wished I could read this, but I have never had the key to unlock the language. Take this for now. &quot;<br><br>To translate the note Yendar needs a lexicon from the plane of hate called the &quot;book of souls&quot;.  The rogue sneaks behind the maestro of rancor and picks it up off the ground.<br><br>&quot;Yendar Starpyre says 'The Book of Souls chronicles all the lives Innoruuk has tainted over the years. It is in the care of the Maestro of Rancor. I can use this tome as a basis for my translation, if you return it and the note to me. An experienced practitioner in the art of non-detection should be able to snatch it from its resting place, don't you think, Segfault?<br>&quot;<br><br>When yendar finally translates the letter with the book, stano's evil daughter, renux herkanor spawns and takes the letter, the rogue brings a small raid to kill her.<br><br>Yendar Starpyre says 'My, this is quite a large list! Yes, I can use the names and dates recorded here to help me understand the script. It should be a simple matter now. A moment, please. Aha, yes, there we go. Traslated as best I can! I do hope you're not involved in what is described here, as it is quite fiendish. Oi! You, woman! Give that back! Soandso , that woman there took your letter! I think I should leave you to discuss it with her. Best of luck! <br><br>Renux drops a translated parchement, which can be read by the rogue, the text is:<br><br>&quot;T'kar:<br><br>We are ready for you to move into the next phase of the plan.<br><br>I have read your thoughts on the x'kanta Johann, and his chosen tool, Stanos. Johann is a willing pawn, and will serve us well, for greed is yet another facet of Innoruuk's power.<br><br>Stanos should also work out well, he is quite formidable, though I understand he does not yet know he has been chosen to actually carry out the task. Watch him well when the time comes, but I agree with your judgment.<br><br>Joren will be in Qeynos the entire month, so you have ample time to s'ktkar your task. Enclosed are the tools you will give to the Human x'kanta.<br><br>The blade is a gift from Innoruuk himself, forged in his temple and imbued with rage. Be sure to recover it after the mission is complete, it is much too powerful to leave in the hands of those we intend to il'kaash in the future. Combined with Stanos' skill, Joren and his guards should fall easily.<br><br>The Guise has been handcrafted by our Master Coercer and should allow the wearer to pass undetected as Koada'dal, thus allowing the assassin to gain entry into the Ambassador's quarters. Luckily, it shall be a human transforming himself into that zm'rina form.<br><br>Be sure to eliminate all the human x'kanda you have recruited, and have no fear of the repercussions, for the Circle of Unseen Hands is no threat to us here in Neriak.<br><br>I have spoken with your master Tani N'mar and he assures me that his group of x'kantar will aid us if need be.<br><br><br>GENERAL RALD VGHERA &quot;<br><br>NOTE that the general speaks of the high elf illusion mask.<br><br>Renux also drops a dagger which you will turn into stanos with your final stuff to get your epic.<br><br>She also drops some rogue armor, and a sword.<br><br>Giving stanos the parchment:<br><br>'Stanos Herkanor says 'Let me see what you have here. Aha, so that's who.. yes, yes! There is one more thing I need you to do. This document tells me who the originator of the plot really was. His name is General V'ghera, which is interesting, as Anson's men have spotted him in Kithicor recently. He will not be easy to get to, but if you give this box to one of his many aides, the General will HAVE to come to investigate. You see, this box used to contain the tools crafted for the assassination. When he arrives, kill him! I need any documents you find on him - with luck it will be enough evidence to convince Hanns that what I say is true. Bring any documents or dispatch cases you find, along with those blades Vilnius made you work so hard for, and we will make a trade. <br>&quot;<br><br>So you spawn general by giving his box to the DE's loot his pouch, and give it to stanos with the jagged diamond dagger, and the cazic quill ( side quest from vilinus the small, or can rarely drop off general ).<br><br>Give the jagged diamond dagger, cazic quill, and generals pouch to stanos:<br><br>&quot;Stanos Herkanor says 'Very well done. I leave now to confront Hanns with this evidence. Even so, it will not be easy to regain his trust. That is why I need those daggers, in case all else fails.&lt;chuckle&gt; Bristlebane grant me luck - I can no longer live like a hunted dog. In any case, I am grateful for your aid. Take this wretched blade, I can bear it no longer. I must warn you, I feel it carries Innoruuk's curse; all who are near it learn the meaning of hate. &lt;chuckle&gt; Ironic, isn't it? You went to all that work to redeem yourself for a rapier, yet the true reward came when you redeemed another. &lt;chuckle&gt;.
