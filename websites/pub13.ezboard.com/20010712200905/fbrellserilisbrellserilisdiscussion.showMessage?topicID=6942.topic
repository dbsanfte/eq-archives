And it showed him dead in Grobb (his bind point).  I'm like WTF.  The night before, I had left him full and healthy.  So I log on and start asking my party members.  So my friend Anada started looking at different portal places.  Nothing.  I'm like freakin out.  No clue where my body could have been.  Well we petitioned the problem, and then someone just happen to stumble across it.  Over near Karnor Castle????   What the hell.  I'm not even sure Pel has ever been to KC, certainly not between the time I logged on last night and 5 a.m. the morning before.<br>
<br>
So the only thing I figure is that someone else moved him there.  No one  has access to my account.  I don't let others play my characters.  No one else has access to my computer.  So, not knowing whats going on I changed my password just to make sure.<br>
<br>
Now, my question is this.  If I had petitioned, according to the new rules, would my account have been banned?  Even though I have no farkin clue how he got there or even how he died.   I mean, I was literally dreading telling a GM about the problem, even though I was already about to begin porting form zone to zone with a bard to try and see if it was even in a zone.  How often have we read an E-Mail from Oribi, or like Tanari, something like:<br>
<br>
Hi.  It appears you were in KC and died blah blah.  Obviously you broke EULA and now you're banned.  Have a nice day.<br>

What do you guys think?<br>

If you have all your gear I wouldn't even ask the GMs.  With this stupid new policy, yes, you would lose your account.  Even if you don't have any gear I wouldn't risk it.  This is just Verant's way of reducing the amount of work they have to do. <p><table>

That may have been exactly what happened.  I talked to Anada, who had a much better memory then I did, and she reminded me that the morning before, instead of actually logging, I went LD during port to DL.  Well, since we were just porting folks out at the end of our group, I went ahead and went to bed.<br>
<br>
I wonder if there was someone running around as my warrior.  Probably PL'ing someone or something and died.  We found the body way down by KC, which I'm fairly certain my character didn't run through the tunnel and over that way on its own.  Too weird.<br>
<br>
I'm not even going to talk to the GM's for fear they will ban me.  I'm so glad that my gear was still there.  I'd have pissed myself if my newly aquired 60k bracer was gone.<br>
<br>
Well thanks for the insight.  At least that helps my curiosity a bit.  Oh and btw... /rude VI's new policy.<br>

There are a few safe spots.  The one that people go to on zoning low health is by the wizard spires but there is also one down in the grass.  If thats where you were then that is probably what happened.  You would have fallen for 10k as well since you would have zoned in at the elevation of the druid/wizard portal which is a few hundred feet higher.<br>
<br>
If you know the coordinates send me a tell or email and I can verify if thats the spot.  I don't give out safe spot coordinates after seeing all the people that tried to abuse it when I was a guide.  But after rezing many people in that same spot when I was a guide I can pretty much bet that is what happened.   <p><table>

We were fighting Draco, and had a Worry Wraith and an Amy Knight as adds.  After some moron meleer broke Mez on the Worry Wraith like 17 times, all the Enchanters and Clerics were either dead or too busy to heal the tanks and the camp was called.<br>
<br>
I had just respawned at my bind point in Fear and I hit /q with full health and a bunch of people around me.<br>
<br>
We log back and I find that I lost a ton more xp than I expected.  Furthermore there was one extra nude corpse of mine there.<br>

Evidently after I /q'ed out, I was killed by Draco, then I RESPAWNED WHILE LD and was killed AGAIN.  I mentioned this to Warpriest and he said the exact same thing happened to him as well.  That is DEFINITELY not supposed to happen.  I got my bodies ressed and the raid basically broke up at that point.<br>

If you /q out you are in game for 60 seconds.  If you die while LD you will still respawn and possibly die again.  That isn't anything new.  It really sucked back before naked corpses stayed around for 3 hours.  Thats why people hated binding in Fear cause you could literally lose two or three corpses to a bind death loop.<br>
<br>
For those of you that got ported across zones after zoning thats because you zoned low health.  If you zone very low health it can kick you across to the zone safe spot. <br>
<br>
Also if you zone while your hp are low enough that without the hp items you have on you will literally die as far as the computer is concerned but you will pop up on the other side with all buffs stripped and back to the amount of HP you had previous plus the hp items.   Easy way to test this (its something that happens to my twink if not careful).<br>
<br>
  Make a twink, give him 2 Velium Fire Opal Rings (+65 hp) now you have about 160 hp  (130+30 base).  Cast a buff on yourself.  Fall for enough damage to get yourself down to about 20 hp.  Now zone.  You will come out the other side without the buff and will be nearly full health.   If you dont have any buffs this is a great way to heal yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    but it really sucks when you get really buffed up and zone with too low health and lose everything. <p><table>

Q: A really strange thing has happened to my character. I was wearing a sword in my primary weapon slot, but when I logged in today, it shows that I'm holding a fish in my weapon slot. What should I do to have my weapon reimbursed?<br>
<br>
A: Please contact a GM immediately and the GM will investigate the issue. Please make sure not to remove the affected item.<br>
<br>
Hasn't that just happened to everybody...? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Brinklith Rioghbhardan</b> - The Jester of Avalon<br>

  How the heck do they come up with these safe spots?!?! I zoned into Skyefire while running from one of the dragoons in The Overthere. Apparently, I was killed while zoning, so I was placed in the safe spot of Skyefire. Well, needless to say, to a level 35, it wasn't very safe. I didn't have gate memmed (I was in the process of switching spells when I got attacked), so I tried to mem it. Before I could do that, I got slaughtered. Why are there safe spots like this? What's wrong with placing a character just on the other side of the zone? <br>
<br>
  Oh, and the past two times I've died in LGuk, I spawned at my bind point, spear and shield in hand, but nothing else. Maybe we're due for another patch. <p><center><font color="#000099" size=+1><i>Boluk Wolfrunner</i></font><br>

I heard that there is an actual very rare program that has a wide username/password database for EQ. Someone has been screwing with VI. Old passwords on older accounts are very prone for hacking I think. How would anyone get username/password from VI anyhow? Beats me. This is just what I have been hearing.<br>
