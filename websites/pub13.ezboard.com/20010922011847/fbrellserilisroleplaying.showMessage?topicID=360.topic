While he was no pathetic Ranger, pillaging berries and digging for grubs, he did have an excellent sense of direction. Centuries of campaigning and countless battles had honed his above ground skills almost as fine as his Under-dark abilities. He knew where the his prey had their camp, knew that they would be there. He had traveled from the deserts of Southern Ro, after slaughtering the rare and short-lived Ancient Cyclops that roamed there, and had made his way into the Innothule Swamps. He traveled quickly and with ease, for nothing in either of the Southern swamps could threaten him. Only in the Rathentear Mountains, and the Lake beyond, were there any beings who might challenge his supremacy. But, they were circumvented and easily avoided…for now. Some day, when the War of Vengeance was justly unleashed by the Teir’dal against the rest of Norrath, he would exterminate all who dared stand in the path of the Respected Race. For today though, there were other matters to attend to. Zirrix knew of his foes, the race called the Shadowed man, and had studied their ways. Fortunately, due to his brother Tzlar’s efforts, the library of House T’Rhennic was one of the best in all Neriak. Zirrix often studied the various tomes and scrolls to learn of the habits and weaknesses of his enemies before going into battle or on a hunt. The Shadowed man were one of the many curiosities in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Much of the commonly known information about them was woefully inaccurate, having been complied through rumor, legend or superstition. Every half-witted drunkard, in every ale pouring tavern in Norrath, had their own “true” information about the Shadowed man race. It was just as important to know what was false about them, as it was to know what was truth. First off, contrary to common lore, the Shadowed man were not Undead. Spells and protections against the Undead had no effect upon them. They were just as blind to a spell of invisibility, as any other mortal race on Norrath. They were magical in nature though, and were gifted with extreme speed. They could outrun even the vaunted Spirit of Wolf spell, so favored by Shamans. After much research, Zirrix could piece together some things about their history. They seemed to only practice only two Caster related professions, that of Necromancy and Cleric. Mirroring these were the two martial classes of Warrior and Monk. There seemed to be no Wizard, Shadow Knight, Enchanter or Mage class. They lived in isolated camps in all regions of Norrath, save one. They had no camps in the colder climates. There were known camps in the sulfur choked heat of the Lavastorm Mountains, but nothing in the Everfrost Tundra. Thus, it seemed they were more at home in the warmer climates. Also, while they may have once had a city of their own, now all that remained were the various camps of nomads. That, teamed with the hatred and hostility that the Keepers of the Temple of Solusek Ro held for them, led to several possible conclusions. <br>
<br>
Zirrix believed that once, long ago, they may have been somehow allied to the God of Magic, Solusek Ro. Their weapons were magical in nature and faded away after a time, which hinted at some arcane influence. Their great speed and invisible appearance also hinted at great magic’s. Actually, they were not completely invisible, and a careful observation would reveal their “shimmering” outlines. Unfortunately, by the time anyone got that close to them, they were doomed. They seemed hostile to every other race and faction in Norrath, and immediately attacked anyone in sight. What circumstances had made them the way they are? There were clues for those who knew how and where to look. Zirrix thought that they must have somehow angered Solusek Ro, perhaps by joining the Giant races in Rallos Zek’s war upon the other Gods. In punishment, Solusek Ro smashed their city and scattered them throughout Norrath in the turmoil that followed. But, that was all speculation based on observation and the few mentions of them in various ancient tomes. What ever their history or physiology, Zirrix had need of their death, and so die they would. After a brief march, Zirrix came upon their camp.<br>
<br>
By using his bow to good effect, and other skills and abilities known only to those of a Warrior’s profession, in a short time he had in his possession the object he required. It was a Rapier of Shadowed man make. Zirrix knew he was now on a race against time. He must hurry, for anything of Shadowed man creation was unstable and short-lived. Turning once again in the direction of Lake Rathentear, Zirrix set off on the final chapter of his quest for the priceless boots of the Journeyman. He would stop by the bank in the Ogre city of Oggok, and then return to the Rathentear Mountains to begin his search for the elusive and darting Gnome known as Hasten Bootstrutter.<br>

Sorry this second part took so long in coming. Busy week at work. I hope you all enjoy it. Thanks.<br>
