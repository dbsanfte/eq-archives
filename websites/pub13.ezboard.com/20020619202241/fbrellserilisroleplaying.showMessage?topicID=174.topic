Tonight was the night. Her first performance in public, other then the House  members, in which she was to play and sing alone, without her teacher. Her teacher had met a fatall end on his journeys in Kunark. Now she was on her own, with the lute he gave her.<br>
<br>
The young wood elven bardess looked around the tavern with her striking green eyes. She smiled nervously at some of the members of the House that frequented this tavern often. They knew it was her first night solo, and were here as a comfort. <br>
<br>
She sat up on the stool, tossed her fiery red hair over her shoulder and cleared her throat. Her fingers carressed the strings of the lute as she tuned it. She hummed a few notes along with her lute, a cue to the audience that she was about to start.<br>
<br>
She started with only an introduction played by her dancing fingers upon the strings.Then her voice sang.<br>
<br>
&quot;They speak of sweet, sweet love<br>
Of the joy it brings<br>
Of how you've not without it<br>
But tell me, oh tell me, my love<br>
Have you tasted? Have you lived?<br>
Do you feel as I feel?&quot;<br>
<br>
By the fourth line, she had built up a crescendo, but as she ended the first part, she softened into a quiet melody.<br>
<br>
&quot;The talk of delicious, delicious wine<br>
Of the taste they savour<br>
Of the feeling it gives<br>
But tell me, oh tell me, my dear<br>
Have I drank of this wine?<br>
Do you drink of mine?&quot;<br>
<br>
Selinas lowered her head and and watched her fingers, engrossed in her singing, no longer thinking of the audience before her. Members of the House watched in fascination, this was a song they had not heard.<br>
<br>
&quot;They sing of free, free life<br>
Of being carefree<br>
Of living without masters<br>
But tell me, oh tell me, my sweet<br>
Have I had a carefree life?<br>
Do you treat me as a slave?<br>
<br>
They tell me to feel as they do<br>
To be free and be loving<br>
To drink and be loved<br>
But tell me, oh tell me, my darling<br>
Should I do as they say?<br>
Do you feel as I do?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her eyes lifted from her lute and she looked out the window, to the vast forest of the Greater Faydark. Her fingers did not slow, not did she stray from the melody and rhythm she had set. It was flawless. Her voice was solid, yet musical and swaying.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want to feel this love<br>
I want to taste this flowing wine<br>
I want to live this carefree life<br>
But tell me, oh tell me, my lover<br>
Will I ever do these things<br>
Will you help me, oh please?&quot;<br>
<br>
Selinas felt an incredible sense of longing within herself. She continued to gaze out the window, her fingers knowing so well to go, the music flowing through her fingers. Her feeling were openly displayed, but she cared not what others thought. It was her time to shine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets speak as they speak<br>
Let's talk as they talk<br>
Let's sing as they sing<br>
But let me tell you, oh yes, my one and only<br>
If this is not what you want<br>
If we are too different.<br>
<br>
Leave me be<br>
Or stay with me<br>
Let's be together<br>
And tell me, oh tell me<br>
Will our love flow like wine?<br>
Will we live carefree?<br>
<br>
Oh yes<br>
We will, for you and I<br>
Are one, oh yes<br>
My love, my dear, my sweet<br>
My darling, my lover, my one and only<br>
You are mine, forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Selinas ended her song with a decrescendo, slowing down. Holding the last note.Then it ended. She was silent for a moment then looked up and smiled. Clapping came and went. She took out her hand drum and played a few marches, ballads, then a dance with her flute. She was happy and it looked successful.<br>
