Maybe you can't solo at 60.  Come to The Gey on any given night on my server and I will show you cleics who solo just fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It wont help you that much on raids....as in being raid desireable...it wont...Clerics will still be the top demand healer. Druids will solidly be in the slot of backup healer. &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Yup.  Which is exactly what the petition has asked for.  If you had read it carefully instead of getting your dander up you would know that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Thorny Ol' Sauerkraut</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/24/02 5:29:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=820>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Clerics MUST group&quot;<br>

Finding a 50+ Cleric LFG is about as likely as finding a Fungi for 5K.

Were you around when the game started?  If so take a second look at then and now... if not, you really have no clue what you are talking about. The game has and is evolving. I have been on almost every boss raid in game ( except for a few in Luclin) and the mellee enhancing armor and weapons that drop now compared to even Kunark's expansion is really uncomparable.  We have a warrior in our guild the can stand toe to toe with Avatar of War,and pretty much any other boss mob for that matter, keep aggro, and do hundreds of k damage with his equipment. As long as the healing chain does not break down. We have a pally that has a weapon that can crit well over 2k with her aa skills. Now put this kind of mellee raid equiped person in FG or Maidens or where-ever, with a druid or cleric and watch how fast they can tear through the mobs. Game &quot;balance&quot;  was actually lost a long time ago but at level 60 we spend our time raiding or getting aa points and this really is of no consiquence to pre 60 players. I certianly aren't hunting where pre-50 level players are.  Twinking? 90% of this &quot;uber&quot; loot is lore - no drop.  <br>
Now if you can understand that, it leads to this.  The warriors and mellee were &quot;balanced&quot; against each other, but in that balancing and with the kind of items dropping in the &quot;high&quot; end game they are balanced to the high end game and where it is leading. Once again the game is evolving ( life beyond level 60). Now, pre- Kunark, for those of you who have not been in this game for the total life of it, all the classes went through a balancing act and in the end it worked relatively well. With the release of Kunark things started to fall apart a bit. Adjustments were started but then more expansions to where we are today. In this process the druid has fallen so far behind it is unbelievable. Except for mellee skills, the druid was second in most casting classes, not all, and was a true all around &quot;jack of all trade&quot;. We are now &quot;jack of nothing&quot; really we have fallen so far behind. Casters to, have fallen behind in a number of areas also, as to where the high end game has gone and is going. Casters are getting &quot;balanced&quot;. This is level 60 balancing to the high end game. All balancing is relative to the warrior as they are the focal point of the game for Verant. If they get truely balanced compared to the way the warrior is, they should do quite well. The druid has been historically left behind by Verant through it's life in the game. The loot tables are puny for druids as compared to all the other classes and most &quot;uber&quot; loot that a druid can use, so can a shaman and cleric... in a power building guild the &quot;guild&quot; need always comes before the personal need and seldom does the druid get to aquire said loots before other classes are equiped. Why? because we cannot contribute as much to the raids as the others can.  We used to be able to be a very useful class but the game has evolved ( there is that word again) far past us. If it takes better dots,nukes heals, and/or buffs to put us back in our place then so be it. <br>
<br>
There will always be some of you that whine - that is to powerful to so and so - that is to much healing - your dots are to big - blah blah blah.  BUT this is NOT about pre-60 game anymore. As a Druid I want to catch up in my abilities relative to the raiding I am doing now and be usefull again.<br>
<br>
And I will say it again for those of you who have not been on boss raids but know so well that druids don't need such-and-such cause it is unbalancing to the game. Old norrath Vox ,Nagafen etc .. druids ok .. Kunark release druids fall behind a bit but new spells and stuff still make druid viable to the tougher boss mobs...Velious and then Luclin came out and a lot of ground lost for druids as other classes gained some improvement. We did finally gain  some better armor as in quest armor, or similar armor to it that drops in Umbral Plains but over all the new boss mobs drove us to the bottom of the class usability scale. If you have been on these &quot;uber&quot; raids you know that druid damage now is nothing whether dot or nuke, healing is meaningless against cleric CH and most other caster classes have one or more better versions of our buffs. Even as a secondary anything we suck bad now. For those that don't know these mobs in the &quot;end&quot; game hit for 600-1200 quads,rampage, summon, have rather high MR and have MEGA HP. 500K, 800K, 1mil HP.  They can have AoE dots that do 10k damage. They make Vox and Nagefen look old and crippled. The game has advanced and the druid really hasn't. So screw this crap about pre60 non raid balance. It is a relative thing. Have the uber 60equiped mellee hurt the &quot;balance&quot;? Not to bloody  much.  <br>
<br>
And what happens when Planes of Power expansion is released?<br>

<br>
Your arguements are about as old and worn as they come.<br>
They are based on 2 simple points<br>
1) Clerics are more desirable to any group<br>
2) Druids can solo better.<br>
<br>
From these (2) Acceptable facts, you leap to the conclusion that Its acceptable.<br>
<br>
It is not.  First, if all I want to do as a Druid is Solo, I will go play my Playstation 2.  Do not tell me &quot;because you can solo, you don't need a group so its okay that you can be worthless to a group and spend hours and hours LFG.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats a bunch of bull.<br>
<br>
Secondly, <br>
Craft your own damn petition for clerics.  God knows they need it.  Spells that are anti-planes/deity based, or undead upgrades, etc.<br>
<br>
All with focus, of making clerics better for soloing.<br>
<br>
Before you respond to the above.  Please explain to me why<br>
its acceptable that every high end guild has 2 things.<br>
((key word explain why its acceptable))<br>
1) Has 3* or more clerics than druids for a raid<br>
2) Gives Loot Rites on FT/High AC wis pieces to Clerics first, shamans second, druids third.<br>
<br>
You seem focus on a paper game.  You point out a select few high end items, that are cleric/druid usable.  Now, heres my test for you.  Find 10 Druids who have these items, while Clerics in thier guild have worse.   Try reverse.  Find 10 Clerics who have have these, while Druids in thier guild have worse. <br>
<br>
Again, you accuse druids not thinking big picture, yet you don't.  You take out CH sometimes.  You take out how top guilds structure loot.  You take out membership in top guilds.<br>
<br>
In another words, please explain WHY druids should be 2nd class citizens in any end guild?<br>
<br>
Also, why is it Clerics whine so much about Druids?  Shamans can solo better (than a druid, and especially a cleric).  Shamans can also replace a Cleric in many cases.  ((Notice though that this is mostly at 60 with torpor.  IE at the END of the game.))<br>
<br>
A 60 Shaman can easily replace a 50 to 54 Cleric.  <br>
A 60 Druid can not.<br>
<br>
A 60 Melee can replace a 50 to 54 Warrior.<br>
<br>
Nuff Said.<br>
<br>
<br>
