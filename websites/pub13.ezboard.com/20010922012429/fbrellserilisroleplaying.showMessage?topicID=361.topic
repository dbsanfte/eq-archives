He keep the faceplate down on his helm to try and save him from breathing the foul air of Oggok. Actually, this was they 7th time the imbecilic mountain of fat and stench had tried to count out the gold pieces. Zirrix was not known for his tolerance of such stupidity, worse, the fool had asked the Teir’dal Warrior more then a dozen times if he wanted platinum pieces instead. Zirrix did not bother to explain anything to the lout, but just ordered him to gather the gold. Finally, after an eternity, Zirrix picked up the bags of gold. They were extremely heavy, and Zirrix had to shift his weight to get a solid grip on the gold. At this point the Ogre guards, standing in the corners of the bank, began to laugh and make comments. The Ogre Captain looked at Zirrix and said, “Whats matter lil dark elfie, golds too heavy for joos? Maybbe you wanna strong Ogre to carry for joos? Whats you need so much golds fer anyhows?”. Turning to face the Captain, Zirrix replied, “I need the gold to by the spices I require to make Ogre tongue stew”. The Ogres stopped laughing, grasped their sword hilts, and advanced threateningly upon Zirrix. Flipping his face shield up suddenly, he took two steps and closed the distance to the Ogre leader. The Ogre, looked down at Zirrix and snarled in anger and contempt. As it went for it’s weapon, it caught sight of the guild emblem of the Violent Harvest around Zirrix’s neck. The Harvest was well known in the “Evil” territories of Norrath, and their members were not to be trifled with. Hesitating a moment, the glimmer of a thought sparked in the Ogre’s mind. Standing still, the Ogre guard began to speak, as much to himself as to Zirrix, trying to work through it’s muddled mind. It said “Joos in the Violet ‘Arvest, I knows about them. Theys gots two tough Warriors in der. Ones a girl, called Faelin, de others a boy called Zirx. Joos not a girl fer sure, so joos must be….”. At that point the Ogre’s words trailed off as he realized who he was trying to intimidate. Now, it is known throughout the realm that of all the races, Ogres are all but immune to fear. They just don’t understand the concept of being afraid of anything. Many stories abound of Ogres trying to head-butt certain well known Dragons during raids into their two lairs. Dragons were one thing, but enraged Teir’dal Warriors were another matter entirely.<br>
<br>
The silence in the bank became oppressive. The Ogre guard towering, not so threateningly now, over Zirrix. While Zirrix stood, still as a statute staring into the Ogre’s face, the Teir’dal’s eyes devoid of any sign of emotion. The Ogre looked briefly to his companions, who had started a slow but steady movement towards the exit, indication the level of support the Ogre leader could expect. Looking back and forth quickly, the Ogre swallowed and stammered out, “Oks, joos done now wit the shineys, I guess joos be goin’ nows, oks?”. Zirrix waited just a few moments more, just enough to cause the Ogre to consider what might happen if he decided not to “be goin nows”. Then, moving with a sudden swiftness that actually caused the Ogre to wince, Zirrix turned his back upon the behemoth and steeped toward the exit. The Ogre let out an audible sigh, and started to relax. Zirrix stopped at the door and said to no one in particular, “I have important matters to attend to, when I am done I shall return here, to finish other business I now have”. Then, without a further comment, Zirrix walked out into the cold, dark and foul air of Oggok. Back in the bank, the Ogre guard considered for a moment then said to the banker, “Joos give me all my shineys now, mes got to go do somtin’ somewhers else, somewheres way far else”. Meanwhile, out in the fetid swamp of the Ferroot did a heavily encumbered Teir’dal Warrior march in a steady pace toward the Rathentear Mountains, and his current objective…        <br>
