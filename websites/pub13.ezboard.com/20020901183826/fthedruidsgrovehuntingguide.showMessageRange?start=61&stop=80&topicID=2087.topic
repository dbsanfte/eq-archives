(made friends with most of the people whom I PLed).  I've done four warrior, three rogues, a monk, a mage, two rangers, three paladins, two necros.  Let me just say that if you're going to PL, try as you as you can NOT to PL a caster.  They have low ac, low hp, crappy offensive abilities and they are just plain hard ot keep alive.  PLus PLing goes hecka slow with a caster.  So go for a tank type.<br>
<br>
Here is what I did<br>
Lvl 1 to 4 - Snakes, rats, and all that junk.<br>
Lvl 5 to 9 - Orcs and Dervs in the Southwestern corner of Oasis of Marr. Two orc camps here plus tons of wandering orcs.  <br>
Lvl 10 to 14 - Reavers, animals and stuff in EC.  Bes tplace is the reaver hill.<br>
Lvl 15 to 30 - Temple of Cazic Thule.  I Haven't read many of the posts here, but haven't seen anyone put this down.  This is the best place to PL a tank.  My warrior (has a 55 ranger as main and is an RL friend) would take his half elf in full FS and run around in the maze until he gets some mobs then comes back to me in the same inner corner inside of the maze.  There, I'd hit him with dmg shield, and just relax while watching his hps.  Easy as pie and extremely fast exp.<br>
Lvl 31 to 40 - Lower Guk.  Best place is the Bedroom to 35 then either Ass/Sav/Cav/Exe (But NOT Sage).  <br>
Lvl 41 to 50 - Dreadlands and LGuk. Both are decent, but by now it gets hecka slow and boring.  So put on some music, get out your eq papers and just relax.  Make the tank pull since he/she should be high enough to do it.  <br>
<br>
Some guy posted here saying that every 4 levels, the guy should get his skills up.  Well, that's good advice, but not necessary.  I mean, his skills will be flying when you put him with SLN, Chrolo, DMg Shield and set him against a red mob.  Oh, never waste mana.  You should never bother with any other buff, except maybe magic resist if you are in LGuk.  If you get down to 40m or lower, call a short break and med, especially if the guy you are PLing is in his 30s or higher.<br>
<br>
If you're doing the pulling, fudge about safety and pull like two or three mobs.  It's hecka fun ;)  Set them against your tank, root and snare all of them, then just watchi the guys health.  PLing is as easy as pie as long as you have good mana at all times.  If mana gets low and mob's kicking your buddies butt, don't be afraid to say &quot;zone&quot;.  Oh, and whether the mob runs or not, snare it.  Use snar euntil the guy is in his 30s then use ensnare.  Just in case.  Always expect the unexpected.  ANything could happen.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and usually when you get into the PLing business and get good at it, people give you awesome things.  I've been offered lumi staff, 30k, shieldstorm, MoSS, thorneblade of yk, hammerhead helm, smr, iksar regen bp, glowing black stone, Crown of King Tranix, KDs, wu sticks, fighting batons, fbss, tbbs and more.  I tell you, get good, play long hours (like me, hehehe) and you'll get rich within a week.  If the guy is paying you plat, then make out a system.  Like, &quot;pay me every 5 levels&quot; or &quot;pay me every level&quot;.  Just know that the lower levels, you should not get alot of plat cause they're easy, but at higher levels, you should get plenty.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm done blabbering.  Hope some of that helps ya.  ANd yes, in case people haven't noticed, I don't like Kunark or Velious PLs much.  Too sucky there.<br>

Then ported us to BB, bound him in Gfay and went to unrest. Level 3, yes. Memmed &quot;Healing&quot; spell and off we went to kill beetles. 3 hours later he was lvl12 and we called it a night. At around his lvl 10 when he reached 400+ hps i memmed greater healing. Wolfform of course.. at lvl 11 we just stood in front of house and took whatever came our way. i rooted with grasping roots and healed him.. i guess it's good spot until about lvl 17-18 or so. Then we can move pretty deep into house... or go to LOIO.<br>
About velious.. i think orcs and later stalags/spiders in CC are pretty good.. and around 33-35 you can move to walruses/ulthorks in EW or wolves in GD. Lots of mobs, don't hit hard, don't flee when more than one. We'll see... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utjfennig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tjfennig</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333399>(4/20/01 9:00:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> Unrest yard trash is great exp to 14.  i was about lvl 9, then we tried unrest.. so many mobs, and only 3 will attack at once.. <br>

<br>
1 - 5, newbie zone, buff up and run around killing everything<br>
<br>
5 - 30, Upper Guk, at 12 start with the heart spiders and frog spawns close to that, at 20 work your way down a little more toward scryer area, and around 25-30 do shins near lower guk live side<br>
<br>
30 - 35, overthere, sit near skyshrine ramp and pull the sarnaks outta the tarpit just out from it when there isnt anything around<br>
<br>
35 - 50, lower guk/solb, great exp, in lguk you can pull mobs to arch mage safehall, or go to solb and camp the area above window, or named depending on what you can find open<br>
<br>
been considering trying CoM for 35 - 50, can't get off my ass and go there though =P I'm a big fan of zones you can stay in for a ton of levels ( upper guk ) I hate moving around, plus that place is never camped <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umegillagerilla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Megilla Gerilla</A> at: 5/1/01 11:31:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=galianaofquellious>Galiana of Quellious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333399>(5/1/01 3:44:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> No no no, you people missed the best and easiest XP in the game. The alluring sirens in OOT. Right when you enter the zone from Butcher, look to the right of the boat. You will see them on some rocks. They are mermaids with orange lower bodies. There's 2 of them, they spawn every 6 minutes or so and give fantastic XP. I took my rogue there at level 10, with my druid standing watch of course. Each kill was a solid blue bubble of xp. By level 13 it was 3/4 a bubble.<br>
<br>
But then I took him to Unrest. Unrest is best at that level for one reason: undead never run. They fight to the death. The rogue's dodge, defense, dual weild and double attack just shot up, and he gained 3 levels in like 2 hours. He's now 16 and parked in Freeport. Eventually I'll take him to Oasis and let him earn the rest without Galiana watching his ass. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utristamdk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TristamDk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333399>(5/1/01 8:09:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> i have only powerlvled my sk to 25 at the moment, but by far the best exp i found from 10-20 was random monsters in Warslik Woods... the best place is the intersection with the iksar monks (one of them drops a bracer of scavaging quite often)  the iksars spawn very fast and you can pull brutes and gobies onto the tank while he fights.  the best part is its secluded and you dont get hassled or have to compete for spawns, and you can just bind in overthere incase the unthinkable happens <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukhieran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khieran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1718<br> <font color=#333399>(5/3/01 10:47:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> You have gotten better at Powerleveling (200)!!<br>

=)<br>
<br>
This is a great thread.<br>
<br>
I'm currently powerleveling a cleric alt on another account since our guild is woefully short of high level clerics at the moment (only 1 level 49+ cleric in the guild).<br>
<br>
1-7 did Misty Thicket (beyond the wall), wasps, giant bats, young kodiaks<br>
<br>
7-11 Derv camp in SRO.  Nobody ever camps it and you get an occassional Sand Giant so you can make some money while powerleveling your alt/friend. <br>
<br>
11-14 Unrest yard trash.  OMG, this is incredible.  I'd run around the yard and snare everything that moved, bringing back 10-15 mobs at once.  Then they'd all bunch up in line waiting to hit me.  The Cleric steps into the middle of the group and casts Word of Pain.  Hits 4 of them at once, who all turn and beat themselves to death on the dmg shield.  Did 11-14 in about 90 mins, plus 1hb, defense, offense are all maxed.  Casting skills were maxed at 11, and I plan on maxing them at every 3 levels thereafter so they don't get too far behind.<br>
<br>
14-??  Currently in EK at Reaver Hill, but several are blue.  May do gorgehounds and dark reavers at the other end of the zone, or go back to Unrest =)<br>
<br>
A little different tactic with my Rogue I'm also powerleveling.  I'd get mobs that I *know* will run at low health and snare them.  That way he gets at least a couple backstab practices on every kill.<br>
<br>
Something that nobody has mentioned.  If you are worried about mobs running at low health, pull more than 1 at once.  Most mobs will fight to the death if there is more than one of them on you.  What I do is pull 2 Reavers and hit one a couple times just to do some damage.  Then switch to the other one.  The first one beats himself to death on the dmg shield while you kill the other.<br>
<br>
Plus, I never pull mobs that are so red that the powerlevelee can't hit.  I hate standing behind a mob for 10 minutes whiffing at it (unless I need weapon practice =). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellendilhsilvermist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellendilh Silvermist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1122<br> <font color=#333399>(5/3/01 1:22:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=71>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~phiphix/ellendihlchibby.gif width=33 height=37></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> I am new at PL'ing and used part of this thread to start easy with a warrior. One thing I have noticed, at least for me, is that it is much safer in outdoors areas than in dungeons. If the area is deserted, it is even better.<br>
<br>
Here is my path so far:<br>
<br>
1-10 : East Karana (beetles, bears, wolves)<br>
11-17: Rathe Mountains (undead ruins)<br>
18-23: Swamp of No Hope (undead ruins)<br>
24-24: Mistmoore - left after 3 deaths (ugh)<br>
24-24: Unrest - left after 2 deaths (ugh-ugh)<br>
24-26: Frontier Mountains (anything but casters)<br>
<br>
Dungeons were really not my thing. Too unpredictable to my liking. <br>

I will probably stay in FM for several more levels, and move to OT around 30. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udaws.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daws</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.aol.com/dawsthedruid/Teeny.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333399>(5/4/01 3:05:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovehuntingguide.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2087.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/dawsthedruid/DawsDog.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Best Power Leveling Location</span><hr size=1> Unrest is truly fabulous.<br>
<br>
Yard trash is good till the beetles become green after 15 or so. Mind you I'm a late night powerleveler.  You get better exp from a handful of low blues than a single yellow.  Having the twink round is great.<br>
<br>
Then, it's time to pl inside the house.  A good spot is on the second floor at the end of the hall in the south east corner.  This is a pretty popular soloing spot so you might want to move into the room next to the creepy gnome. (looking at the magi room door, it is to your left).  You can pull to here from the third floor, the magi room and eventually pull the bartender and knight rooms.  <br>
<br>
If you're PLing a melee, you will eventually want to hit the basement. If you are over 50, you can powerlevel any class on anything down here, including hags and the ghost himself.  Where do you go?  The little dead end hall behind the tentacle terror.  It is a safe spot.  <br>
<br>
Just snare anything you pull in there.  If your twink can't tank it, just tank it yourself.  Snare to keep aggro and let the thorns go to work while the tank does his point of damage.  If you have good resist gear you can do the hags the same way.  Just heal yourself, they go oom and beat the crap out of themeselves on you. Mob casters are truly great experience.<br>
<br>
Another reason I like<br>
<br>
My favorite PLing spots are:<br>
<br>
Misty Thicket 1-6<br>
Steamfont to 10<br>
Unrest to 30 (could go to 40 if alone in basement)<br>
Glacier Yetis to 40, large cave 7 spawns<br>
<br>
The monk I helped was PL'd hard to 40 then made 50 in total 17 days mostly while grouping with people for the last 10.<br>
<br>
My bro and I were taking turns PLing a cleric and had 24 levels in 24 hours going until he logged him on to practice spell skills for a few hours.  I wasn't happy, wanted to see how long we could keep up a level an hour in unrest hehe.<br>

7-15 Unrest Yard Trash.  Mobs thorn themselves to death because they don't run.  Can't beat Unrest IMHO at this level.<br>
15-25 Unrest just down the stairs into the basement.  Again things that don't run rule<br>
21-30+  Cazic Thule Haven't seen Cazic in Anyone's post???  Close to a druid ring (a must for me....don't want to have to run all the way to Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
Haven't gone higher yet, but I have done 1-23 over and over.  Mistmoore also rocks from 17-21 near the entrance.  If there is a low 20's group killing initiates and pledges too, better try somewhere else though.<br>

Going to the Yeti cave next. I am level 27 in 20 hours game time.  <br>

<br>
This is what I've done with my twinks.<br>
<br>
1-5 Newbie Area- This is usually the toughest for me, as I want to get their skills up and going, but you lvl so fast to 5, most skills are still around lvl 1(10)-2(15).  My last twink, my clr, I just played to 5 to help get skills going.<br>
<br>
5-14 Unrest Yard Trash- I agree with many, best in game.<br>
<br>
14-19 LoIO- Mill side.  Mostly cats and skellies.<br>
<br>
19-24 LoIO- Fort side.  Cats and skellies. (getting harder to do now, more ppl camping loio)<br>
<br>
24-30 LGuk BR- Pulled everything but the spiders.  GIBS are better exp than the frogs even.<br>
<br>
30-35 MistMoore- This was more for the fact I like NS Wreaths, Fangs, and would like a cloak.  I usually took the maid/butler or the cloaked dyhampyre guy.  The cooks were a lil rough on my twinks though.  Fountain/cloak is better exp, more mobs, can pull from piano room too if keeping the cy clear.<br>
<br>
35-40 FV- This was a great place for exp.  I went to the drovlarg camp at 800, neg 2k.  There were roughly 30 blue mobs, and not a soul in sight.  Exp is great having that many mobs to yourself.  This was during prime time too, not sure why ppl dont use them more.  Bad loot, but exp is more important when PL'ing.<br>
<br>
40-50 LGuk, KK, SolB-  I prefer the old world mobs, they dont hit as hard.  I mean, with a 40 twink, I could pull the whole pool room, window room, two SK from KR, and all the GK to the LS zone in the 29min spawn time(even after sow wore off heh).  Only problem is more and more ppl are leveling twinks and mains in old world dungeons now too.  I am thinking about trying CoM though w/my lvl 41 war twink.  I think CoM is a bindable area by the zone in or inside.  Just have to get over there like a previous poster mentioned.<br>
<br>
For me, in my experience, 40-50 is slower than the previous lvl's.  PL'ing gets boring to me.  Besides you can still get about a yellow bub an hour in a good group by KC in DL.  For me, grouping is more fun, especially after mostly soloing a dru, and then 'soloing' my twinks with two computers.  If I could get two yellow bub an hour (41-50), I'd solo though.  Since I havent found that, I'll prob group some and PL some to 50 from now on to mix it up. <p>Danee SilverPine, Preserver of Kelethin<BR>

Unless people have their entire guilds camping all of sol b waiting on ragefire, there are plenty of bats, beetles, and ldcs to keep you busy.<br>
<br>
At 33, the best spot I found was pulling kobolds to pool room. Little competition up there and tons of spawns. Kobolds will take you all the way to 47 or 48, but start to green out at 46.<br>
<br>
Can start off at 45 or so in sol a bat(bat 4), starting on bats and the occasional beetle. By this time, the melee should be pulling as his hp and ac will be far ahead of yours, not to mention the pain hell have taunting it off of you(and wasted heals, regrowth, buffs on yourself). Will want to avoid ldcs until 53 or 54 really, unless you have a fungi or epic(rogue/monk). <br>
<br>
At 52 and 53 you can start pulling ldcs, but will want to get drones and winged on them to lower their hp a bit. <br>
<br>
At 56, beetles and bats really start to green out and youll want ldcs only. This would be a good time to move to elbow so you dont have to bother with the green stuff.<br>
<br>
At 58, you can solo pull imps and guardians which should be fairly easy by then. Can do ldcs all the way to 60, as 1/2 are blue and even the greens give exp at 59.<br>
<br>
Rogue in my guild went from 29 to 59 in under 18 days played using exactly these steps and a naked level 51 druid. The warrior Ive been working on is currently at 57 with just over 10 days /played.

That way if I loose conn or lag for some reason. All they have to do is run over the hill. I haven't lost anyone doing this as all MOB's even SG's will not go over the hill. With one exception and that is the snakes, they are ther only MOB that will chase you over the hill. After I pull the MOB to them I ensare it. Since ensnare sticks for 10 minutes the MOB's don't get away. And of course unlike root once the MOB's try to run they stop dead in their tracks with their backs to the player and he or she doesn't get hit as they finish it off. I sit there and med while they are fighting what I pulled and I keep them targeted always to make sure they are okay. Wednesday I took a guild brother from 11 to 13 in around 2 and a 1/2 hours with others fighting the same stuff in the zone. Drybones for a level 11 to 13 melee are very nice experience. If I do PL someone above 15 to 30 I always use unrest. I go in and pull to the pools against the wall.<br>
