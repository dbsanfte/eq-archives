Part 2</span><hr size=1> FLASHBACK<br>
<br>
&quot;There's one right there.&quot;  I snickered from my hiding place behind the tree.  About 10 paces away an orc stood, digging in the dirt, and scratching in bad places.  It was not large... nothing like the centurions and the feared legionaires, this one was a runt.  I ducked my head back behind the tree as it looked in my direction.<br>
&quot;Alexeus, are you sure about this?&quot;  Catherin whispered in my ear.  Another Druid in training just like me, and childhood friend, I would have to give her the credit for getting me out of a lot of jams and keeping me out of trouble.  &quot;You know what the Heartwood Master said.&quot;<br>
&quot;What he does not know will not damper our progress, besides im sick of being a snake slayer, I want some real action.&quot;  I smiled at her reassuringly.<br>
&quot;But what if-&quot;  <br>
I cut her off by stepping away from the tree in clear view of the orc.  I waited for a momment, and cursed.  It still did not see me.  My eye caught a rock on the ground.  I tossed my staff to Catherin and picked up the rock.<br>
&quot;Alexeus, why don't you just-&quot;<br>
&quot;Because this is more fun.&quot;  I did not tell her i was afraid i would screw up the spell again.  I flung the rock, it landed with a solid thunk on the back of the orc's head.  It staggered and looked around, a little dazed, then screamed in fury when it saw me.<br>
I flung out my arms, drawing heat from the area around me and compressing it into one spot between my hands.  The orc was running towards me now, i had to close my eyes to concentrate.  I felt the heat reach near burning between my hands, and released it in the direction of the orc.  I opened my eyes smiling.  That smile quickly melted away as i saw the orc still running towards me.  Where was the fire?  I could smell smoke.<br>
&quot;Ummmm, Alexeus... your pants.&quot;<br>
I looked down, sure enough, my pants were on fire.  I yelped and beat on them, smothering the fire in dirt.<br>
&quot;Look out!&quot;<br>
I looked up just in time to see the orc slashing at me with his claws.  I raised an arm just in time to fend off a killing blow.  His claws raked across my skin.  I grunted and some blood trickled on my face, i knew it was not the orc's.  Catherin, tossed my staff to me, i snatched it out of the air, my arm protesting.  I brought it up as the orc was unleashing another slash, it connected with a crack against the attacking wrist, the orc threw his head back and howled in pain, Catherin was behind it now, It grabbed my staff and raised his other claw to strike again, and a small burst of fire rammed into its back.  It grunted, letting go of the staff, staggering towards me.  I crushed it's face with the end of my staff and brought it down with a sweep, cutting its legs out from under it.  The orc crashed to the ground, the flames still eating at it's skin.  It did not move again.<br>
I stood up and brushed the dirt off my clothing.  Catherin was stalking towards my, a glint of anger in her eyes.  She jabbed me in the ribs with her fist, not hard, but enough to make me grunt.<br>
&quot;Idiot!  You could have been killed!  What did i tell you!&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm... sorry.  Look, it is in the past now.&quot;<br>
&quot;I swear you should have chosen to be a ranger, what the hell was that little act with the fire?  You seem much better with weaponry.&quot;<br>
My mood darkened, as it always did when people questioned my calling.  &quot;Well what do you expect?  According to my folks I am the only one in my family that has ever been born with magic!  How the bloody hell are they supposed to be able to teach me anything!?  And it is not like the Heartwood Master can spend every second of the day teaching me!  Yes that's right, I am a Druid from a family of Warriors, and everyone is just gonna have to live with that!&quot;<br>
For some reason that made her smile.  Woman were strange.  &quot;You sound like one too.  Oh come on I'm sorry.  But your not a Druid yet.&quot;<br>
&quot;Thats all going to change today, my raising to a Druid...&quot;<br>
&quot;Whats wrong?&quot;<br>
I was in deep this time.  I was supposed to be at the Druid guild before the Heartwood Master to recieve my rightfull title of a Druid.  He was going to skin me alive now!  I felt the world caving down around me, i might have just blown my only chance!<br>
&quot;Dammit!  Dammit all to hell!&quot;  I dashed off without a backwards glance.  Catherin yelled somthing about healing, but i did not care to pay attention.  The lifts to Kelethin came into view.  Maybe I was not as late as i thought i was.<br>
I dashed onto the lift and hit the switch, it began to raise into the city in the trees.<br>
&quot;Whats the rush, lad?&quot;  A guard called up to me from the ground.  The lift lurched to a halt, and began to decend back down.  I stompped my foot and glared at the guard when the lift reached the bottom.<br>
&quot;I have to go see the Heartwood Master!&quot;  I reached for the switch and the guard caught my arm.<br>
&quot;Looks like you have had quite the busy day, how did you do this.?&quot;<br>
&quot;I fell!&quot;  I struggled for the switch<br>
&quot;This is from an orc, no doubt... didn't the Heartwood Master tell you not to be hunting orcs until you were properly prepared?<br>
&quot;I-I'm going to see him now, I swear!&quot;  Well, that was part of the truth.  I was going to leave the whole orc thing out of my visit though.<br>
&quot;Gwahahaha!  sure lad, sure.  You know your nothing but trouble.  I think I'll escort you there just to make sure somthing else does not draw your attention, and then tell the Heartwood Master what you have been up to.&quot;<br>
There was no way i was going to get out of this fix.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;I am disappointed, Alexeus.  Again.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sir!&quot;  I was before the Heartwood Master, and he was not impressed.  &quot;I handled the orc fine!  I just had to prove-&quot;<br>
&quot;What you &quot;had&quot; to prove means nothing to me!  I told you to stay away from orcs, will you ever follow orders?  You could not even make it to your own upraising.&quot;<br>
I bowed my head, i was really ashamed this time.  I did not say a thing.<br>
&quot;A Druid raised from warriors.  It shows in your attitude.  I remember when you defeated another one of our training Druids by arms alone.&quot;<br>
I thought it was a compliment, and smiled.<br>
&quot;You are not a Warrior!  Not a Ranger even!  You are a Druid, and you must start acting like one!&quot;  He sighed in frustration.  &quot;I don't know why i took you in.  You have caused me nothing but grief, perhaps it was because of your potential, if you would just let yourself be guided...&quot;<br>
There was somthing final in his voice.<br>
&quot;I want you out of Kelethin, Faydwer even.  Go to the butcher block mountains and board the ship headed for Freeport.  Do not return to Kelethin until you can prove yourself to me who you are.  The ship leaves today, so make your goodbyes quick.&quot;<br>
I was thunderstruck.  Never had this sort of punishment been heard of.  Was i really that bad?<br>
&quot;Why are you-&quot; <br>
&quot;I did not give you permission to speak.  You are dismissed.  Goodbye Alexeus.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
So that was how it was?  It had been awhile since i thought about it. I opened my eyes.  I was still in the world of blue that you can only enter through the magic of teleportation.  I knew that memory only took seconds to see, but it felt like i had been in here for hours.  &quot;So that was how it all began...&quot;  I felt a pang of sadness, it felt strange, i had put my emotions to sleep a long time ago, because i had to.  I closed my eyes again and looked back on better days...<br>
