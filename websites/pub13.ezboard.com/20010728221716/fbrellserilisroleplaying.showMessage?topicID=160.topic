Her delicate script had pleaded for my presence.  She was clearly frightened, and as of late she had not been able to breathe without my word to permit it.  I had hoped the child would be smarter than she was revealing, her actions and words were not reflecting my teachings.  With a brief sigh, I tied my mount and climbed the steep steps of the Inn.  My gaze immediately rested on her small form.  Her face was damp and swollen, tears flooded from her bloodshot eyes and dripped from her nose.  Her lips quivered nervously, then curled into a pout.  Knowing my approach, she quickly pulled herself to her feet and dipped her knees in an awkward curtsey.  Our eyes met for an instant before she respectfully lowered them.  Her fragile hands dropped to her skirts – her grip tightened as her rosebud lips opened to release her troubles.  “I have failed you,” her soft voice stammered.  “I am a fool that has made the most foolish of decisions.”  With a soft chuckle, I seated myself in a nearby chair.  I could already see that this was going to be longer than I had originally planned.  Upon my gentle inquiry, she began her story.  It was an ordinary day in Neriak, no different from another.  Lilanya was resting at her usual table.  Merchants and Adventures, locals and not, all came through, had their drink and went about their business.  All the while Lilanya sat and stared absently towards the wall, thinking.  A clear, sharp voice broke her concentration.  “Lilanya.”  Her head snapped in the direction of the speaker, her eyes meticulously observing his figure.  He was of average height and possessed defined, broad shoulders.  His movements were calculated, but his bearings made him obtrusive.  His face was hidden behind a ghastly mask, its chiseled surface molded from bleached-white bone.  Piercing green eyes gleamed from the guise and its teeth were long and fang-like.  As he looked towards her, he unbuckled his gauntlets and rested his bare hands on her table’s surface.  His eyes fixed on Lilanya as he spoke.  “After countless hours of deliberation, I have concluded that you should be mine.  Our personalities compliment each others perfectly, and besides…you and I have similar goals and similar dreams…and I do find your features pleasant to look at…I mean…I do find you quite attractive, Lilanya.  Together we could conquer the realms, and as my bride, all that I have shall be yours.  Marry me, Lilanya.”  Jeb Praxis had never been one for discreteness, nor did he have any intriguing quality as he claimed.  Never the less, Lilanya consented and allowed him to place a ring on her finger.  She had heard of him previously and assumed his power was in his heritage, as well as his place amongst his kind.  Presently, she deeply regretted her decision.  On her ending note she whispered with a slight smile, “and till death do us part.”   “Is that what you truly desire, my daughter?”   I said sarcastically.  “Are his qualities those that you seek?”  My patience was hanging by a thin thread; I brought her up to be smarter than she was acting.  Lilanya’s cool blue eyes flashed in the dim light as she drew her lips into a smirk.  “It is not the man that I care about, but merely what I might gain from him.  Being in the same room with him and his minions disgusts me… when…”  “What do you wish, girl,” I interrupted harshly.  She was wasting my time; she had obviously not retained any lessons I had given her.  With my last ounce of effort, I smiled complacently and nodded for the child to continue.  “…When I have finished with him, all of him that shall remain will be a faint and distant memory.”  Surprising, some sense was still locked in her mind somewhere, though it was unfortunate that she had made such a sacrifice for it.  My first instinct was to kill this Praxis myself, but if I did, she would never learn to do so on her own.  That, I convinced myself, would be the greater tragedy.  I calmly brought up my hand in a simple gesture, “Enlighten me, daughter.”  As she looked up, her ocean pools radiated with a new determination.  Lilanya unfastened her silk purse and drew a letter sealed with wax and stamped with another’s signet.  “To Lord Manshoon,” she chimed.  “I know little these men, but surely the Praxis and their clan are unacceptable to them.  How can one with such position be so weak in both dealings and in blade?  It is unfathomable!”  I glanced towards the letter, then returned my eyes to her.  “And the letter?”  Lilanya nodded briefly.  “It cannot be traced to me.  The signet is not mine, nor is the script, nor will the slave know who the sender of the letter is.  It has even been spelled by a wizard so that those who touch will not leave any residue or scent upon it.  The plan is flawless.”  I nodded acceptingly as her hopeful eyes observed me.  “Go.  You shall do this to correct these mistakes.  Remember, I shall only aid you so many times, girl.”  As I finished my sentence, Lilanya curtseyed graciously and bolted from the room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uwarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lost One </span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#CC9900>(10/6/00 6:48:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The mind of a Dark-elf</span><hr size=1> Now this story could end here but I have a feeling it does not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
