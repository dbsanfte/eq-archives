He sat motionless, simply to numb to react. Slowly he raised his hands, turning them over in front of his eyes. The lines in his palms were the same. The faded scar was still there, marking both his palm and the back of his hand. He traced a finger over it. A slim diamond scar. Faded, but ever present.<br>
<br>
He turned his hands over again. They were his but they weren't. He was both repulsed and curious at the same time. &quot;What the hell am I gonna do?&quot; he muttered. Running his fingers over his chest. Shuddering as they brushed over the spider. It wriggled under his touch, making his skin crawl.<br>
<br>
The door opened, and Rhasine walked in. He saw her for the first time. She was as beautiful as he imagined. Soft full features. Knowing brown eyes. Her gazed washed down his body. Lingering on his chest. He felt oddly vulnerable. Ashamed of himself, at what he had done. At what he had become.<br>
<br>
Without a word, she walked over to the chest in the corner. Opened it and removed his clothes. They must have undressed him at some point. He felt the blood rushing to his face.<br>
<br>
Rhasine silently dressed him. Lifting an arm here, buckling a catch there. But the clothes fit wrong on him. Garments that once fit well were now far too big for his slender tier 'dal frame. Rhasine helped him down off the table, looking him up and down. &quot;This won't do,&quot; she muttered. Rhasine cinched here and tucked there. Rolling his pants up, slipping his boots over the cuffs. Adjusting the clips on his armor to accommodate his more slight stature. &quot;There,&quot; she said stepping back. &quot;Much better.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz had to admit that the clothes fit better. He twisted at the waist. Extended his reach. It was a flawless job. He looked up at her, peering inquisitively. His question must have been obvious. &quot;I have three boys who are growing like weeds, and little income to buy them new clothes with,&quot; she said. &quot;Now come. There are matters we have to discuss.&quot;<br>
<br>
She led him out of the chamber. They were in a temple of some sort. &quot;This is the Abattoir, a place of learning and contemplation,&quot; Rhasine told him. The passage they were in opened up into a soaring hall. Finely hewn stone pillars supporting a grand arched ceiling. Huge statues of Innoruuk, Cazic and Bertoxx adorned the hall.<br>
<br>
&quot;What kind of learning?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;We study the dead.&quot; She said nonchalantly. 'We?' he thought. A shiver ran down his spine. They walked farther down the grand hall. The crack of a whip jarred the silence, followed by a mournful scream. Another crack sounded and another scream eched through the hall. Minz raised an eyebrow at his guide. She answered his unasked question. &quot;We must have dead to study.&quot;<br>
<br>
The couple approached the scene. A man, an elf actually, was lashed to a statue of Innoruuk. He was stripped of all his clothes. His arms were stretched high over his head and his feet barely touched the ground. The elf's back was to the crowd, bloody, mottled stipes marking the lashes he had received. The Statue of Innoruuk gazed down on the torture, its hands gripping the ropes that bound the elf. Innoruuk playing the part of a malicious puppet master. A small crowd had gathered. Rhasine stopped to watch, and Minz was obliged to stop with her.<br>
<br>
A young erudite administered the lashes, while another, older erudite stood to his side, assessing the youth. The old man was adorned in a simple black robe. Long sleeves flowing over his hands. Wise brow knit in concentration. But he emanated power some how. His very posture and countenance demanded respect.<br>
<br>
Blood trickled down the tortured elf's back and was collected in a basin at his feet. Minz snarled reflexively at the lightskin. Astonished at the hate that welled up within him. He despised the elf. Though he had no reason to hate him. Quite the opposite, he had more reason not to hate him. This poor elf had been captured by the Heretics of Paineel. Tortured for some malaign prupose. And once dead, will be used to spawn more black magiks upon the land. But the venom seemed to flow though him. Seeping into his every pore. The young thief was disgusted and enthralled by the spectacle. His stomach turned. While at the same time his mouth watered.<br>
<br>
Rhasine was staring at him. But he couldn't wrench his eyes from the spectacle. His heart pounded in rhythm with the whipping. The cries of pain became music in his ears. Minz was lost in the passion of the torture.<br>
<br>
The old man held his hand up and the whipping stopped. For a moment the hall was silent. All that could be heard was the panting of the two participants. The young man, whip in hand, breathing heavily from the exertion. And the elf, who gasped in agony. &quot;Who else would have their hate tested.&quot; The elder called out to the crowd. Voice deep and sonorous. Mellow tones echoing off the high ceiling. He scanned the crowd. Piercing brown eyes looking into each face. Minz started as the Erudite's eyes came to rest on him. He backed away a step, trying to slip behind Rhasine and melt into the crowd. But it was too late. &quot;You!&quot; the elder called out. Pointing a finger at Minz. &quot;Step forward and show me your hate.&quot; Minz backed away another step. The elder man stepped forward. His eyes were locked with Minz's.<br>
<br>
Rhasine hissed, &quot;You must! You cannot deny High Lord Coriante Verisue. Go!&quot; Rhasine subtly pushed him forward. The crowd stared at him now, as he walked through the pathway they had made for him. Trying to put aside his fear and insecurity, Minz stepped before the High Lord, and bowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;The flames of your hate are cold young one?&quot; The High Lord said. His voice, no louder than that of a normal conversation, but carried across the hall.<br>
<br>
Minz bowed again. &quot;No High Lord. I am simply shy among crowds,&quot; he replied, keeping his eyes to the ground.<br>
<br>
Verisue laid a hand on his shoulder, smiling at him. It was almost a kind fatherly smile. A reassuring smile. &quot;What is your name my young thief?&quot; Minz glanced up at him. &quot;Your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Minz, High Lord. Minz E'Landril&quot; He replied.<br>
<br>
The High Lord Coriante Verisue thrust the whip into his hand. Spreading his arms wide, stepping back, he called out. &quot;Show me your hate Minz E'Landril&quot;<br>
<br>
A sick thrill ran through his body. The feel of the leather in his hand. Warm and soft. He stared at the brown leather braids. His heart pounded, and he could feel his manhood rise to the occasion. He clenched his teeth. 'What are these feeling,' he thought. Disgusted with himself.<br>
<br>
Eyes were on him.<br>
<br>
His head snapped up.<br>
<br>
The High Lord . . . Rhasine . . . all around him stared. Waiting expectantly.<br>
<br>
Minz took a deep breath and did the only thing he could. He studied his target. Taking a step forward to the right distance. With a flick of his arm, he laid the whip out in front of him. He had used a whip before. He was quite good actually. As a youth on the farm, he and Munz had played with their father's whip. Snapping apples from trees and twigs from eachothers hands at the height of their skill. He rubbed his thumb and forefinger on the supple leather. He eyed his target. Knowing exactly what he had to do.<br>
<br>
With a slow graceful motion he raised his arm. The whip sailed fluidly through the air. Minz watched the leather, making sure the entire length was behind him before he began to snap it forward. The thin lash rounded the corner at last. Flat and perfectly straight for a split second. The idea was simple. Small motions in the hand are carried through the whip and translated into actions at the whip's tail. A twitch or pull at one end would cause the tail of the whip to curve this way or that.<br>
<br>
Minz pulled his arm forward, gently. One didn't have to swing hard to use the whip. Just guide it and let the leather do all the work. The motion more was akin to casting a fly across a stream than to swinging a sword or hammer. He turned his shoulder to point directly at his target. Transfering his weight from his backfoot to front. Finishing the long stroke, he brought his arm around and to the side a bit. Adding a slight curve to the lash. Despite the seeming slowness of his motion, the whip reached its target with a lightening quickness. The tip sailed over the elf's right shoulder. An exhale of breath whispered the disappointment of the crowd. But to Minz, it was right on target.<br>
<br>
A quick flick of the wrist, just as the lash was reaching its full length was all it took. The whip snapped and the leather wrapped around the elf's head. A full turn and a half. Not as much as he would have liked, but it'd have to do. Minz clenched his eyes shut and yanked back hard. Throwing his shoulder back and down. Hoping it would happen quickly.<br>
<br>
The crack was sudden and loud.<br>
<br>
The crowd gasped.<br>
<br>
Minz righted himself. The whip dangled loosly in his hand. And he gazed into the lifeless eyes of the elf. His neck was snapped, head turned completely around. It lulled at a wicked impossible angle. Dead chin resting on a bloody shoulder blade.<br>
<br>
The hall seemed silent. Minz's heart beat loudly. A cold sweat formed on his brow. The High Lord stepped to his side. Tilting his head so he could look squarely into the dead elf's eyes. &quot;Truly the work of an assassin. Quick. Precise. Efficient.&quot; The elder Erudite was easily a foot and a half taller than Minz. &quot;I see your flame burns strong young thief. But you keep it hidden well.&quot; Minz bowed deeply to the high lord. The high lord nodded his head slightly. He was dismissed.<br>
<br>
Minz walked quickly through the crowd. A few murmured words of congratulations or encouragement, but he paid them no heed. His stomach turned. Rhasine was next to him now. He took long strides, rushing him toward the door. His stomach clenched and Minz took off at a run. Just making it out the door and around the corner before his stomach forcefully ejected its contents. He gasped between wretches. A hand settled on his back. Comforting him. He heard voices behind him. Clearly, he was making a scene. Rhasine replied to them. &quot;He had some bad gnome kabobs,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Once Minz recovered his composure, the pair slipped away. Minz did his best to act Tier 'Dal. They gathered provisions. Rhasine insisted on paying. Saying that it was &quot;Xareth's money to be spent on making sure you are well prepared.&quot; She showed him the city. Pointing out the numerous monuments that decorated Paineel and telling him of the great deeds that they represented. Some times they chatted, but most often they walked in comfortable silence.<br>
<br>
By the time they had finished, evening was approaching, and Minz was getting hungry. &quot;What is there to eat around here?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
Rhasine smiled. &quot;There is a quiet inn just around the corner. Its called the Sdlanod'Cm. Have you heard of it? The chef there is renown among his peers. Chef Dlanor Sdlanod'Cm. It is rumored that he even corresponds with light races. Trading recipes and tips.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The scandal!&quot; Minz said in mock horror.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, it would be,&quot; she replied in all seriousness. &quot;He would be killed for it, were he not such an accomplished chef.&quot; Minz shrugged.<br>
<br>
The inn was more than just an inn. The modest double door opened up to a plush quiet setting. Finely carved tables sat on a soft red carpet. Waiters and waitresses silently dashed about in elaborate white yellow and red outfits. Enormous shoes and baggy pants, topped of with a unique headdress and unusual face paints. Quite an exotic sight. Just when he thought he'd seen it all. An enormous Tier Dal came wobbling toward them. Rolls of fat bouncing with each step. &quot;Rhasine! How good to see you again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ecamirg! Its good to see you as well.&quot; Rhasine replied in sugar coated tones. The overweight elf wrapped his chubby arms around her in a warm embrace. &quot;My usual table?&quot; she asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, my dear.&quot; He replied with a courteous bow. &quot;Yrf yug! Take the couple to Miss Rhasine's table.&quot; Yrf yug nodded and escorted them back to private table near the back of the restaurant. They were seated and Yrf yug spoke to them enthusiastically. Unfortunately, he spoke in Erudite, and Minz didn't have the slightest clue about what was said. So he just nodded when it seemed appropriate, and waited to ask Rhasine what the heck this hairy erudite was babbling about. Finally, she thanked Yrf yug, and heleft Minz and Rhasine alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did he say?&quot; Minz asked quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohhh! I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that you do not speak the tongue,&quot; she replied, blushing lightly. &quot;Yrf yug told me that he was happy to see me again. He complimented you in traditional Erudite fashion, saying your head is large for an elf, and that tonight's special is Yppah Laem, served with julienne potatoes and tomato vinagerette compote. Just from the butcher today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Minz boggled over the compliment. Dismissing its oddity to cultural differences. &quot;The special sounds delicious. But what is Yppah Laem?&quot; he asked<br>
<br>
&quot;You've never had Yppah Laem?&quot; she answered. Genuinely surprised. &quot;You must try it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhasine ordered for them. Yppah for him and Retrauq Rednuop for her. Yrf yug was please with their selection. Neriak blood wine was brought the the table. One of the few of Neriak's indulgences that Minz would partake of. It was cold and sweet on his tongue. Thick, but not syrupy. Like a port, but with a bitter hint of iron to it. The smell of the wine was invigorating. The young thief closed his eyes, breathing in deeply the blood wine's heady bouquet. Minz felt the fires burn within him. He opened his eyes and gazed at Rhasine hungrily. She smiled back demurely. Something brushed against his calf.<br>
<br>
His gaze shot down; fearing an assailant had hidden under the table. But all that was there was Rhasine slim foot, caressing his leg. He shot her a crooked grin. Rhasine raised her eyebrows questioningly, feigning innocence. Her foot stroked his leg under the table. Moving higher and higher. Her long limbs easily able to reach all the way up to his thigh.<br>
<br>
Dinner arrived, breaking the seductive game they were playing. The Yppah was absolutely delicious. The steak was tender and sweet. Cooked just beyond the point of rare, but well back from well done. Rhasine's dish was wonderful as well. Another steak dish. Hers served with a wider variety of seasonal vegetables and a butter cream sauce, accenting the flavor perfectly.<br>
<br>
After dinner, they lingered over coffee. Chatting amiably. &quot;How old are your boys?&quot; Minz asked.<br>
<br>
Rhasine smiled. &quot;They are 13, 19 and 22 seasons. All training to be Shadow Knights. My two oldest will bring pride upon our people in their effort. They were born to be knights. But alas my youngest,&quot; she paused, a distant wistful look in her eyes. &quot;I fear will not make it as a knight. He is frail, and slight of build. It will break his heart I think. He wants so much to be like his brothers . . . to honor his father. She sighed and her eyes came back into focus. &quot;But his talent lies elsewhere . . . Necromancy I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was kissing her as soon as they were out the door. Her apartment was nearby. They were up the stairs and through the door in no time. Breathless lust washing over them. His blood burning. &quot;Its is said . . . &quot; Rhasine intoned breathlessly &quot;that . . . wood elf is has aphrodisiac qualities to it.&quot; Minz only half heard her. As he sunk his teeth into her shoulder, biting heard. She moaned loudly. &quot;One thinks . . . your meal has had this effect . . .&quot;<br>
<br>
With a start, he grasped what she meant. &quot;Wood elf?&quot; he sputtered. His stomach clenched. Images of the tortured elf he killed flashing before his eyes. &quot;That was wood elf?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yess,&quot; she hissed. A wicked knowing look in her eyes. &quot;You ate wood elf and you enjoyed it. Admit it to yourself.&quot; She grinned and bit his lower lip.<br>
<br>
He shoved her away. Stumbling over furniture.<br>
<br>
A window.<br>
<br>
Fresh air.<br>
<br>
Breathing deeply. Feeling his stomach turn and cramp.<br>
<br>
'Gods,' he thought. Spinning about and shouting,I have friends that are wood elf. Dear ones! And you . . . you let me eat wood elf!&quot; She had stripped of her clothes and sauntered toward him. &quot;I have wood elf blood in me!&quot; He closed the distance between them in one swift step. Backhanding her hard across the face. She fell to the floor with a painful cry. Rising to her feet with a catlike grace and lust heavy in her eyes. He was both excited and disgusted<br>
<br>
&quot;No Minz, you don't,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You have the blood of a pure Tier 'Dal in your veins. You have Innoruuk's blood in your veins.&quot; She was on him. Rubbing her hips to his pelvis. Rhasine took his hand and pressed it to her lips. Licking a finger sumptuously. &quot;See lover. There is no wood elf here.&quot; She bit him hard. He cringed but didn't pull away, some how excited by the pain. Blood tricked down his arm from her bite. Rhasine put her lips to the wound, sucking softly. &quot;No, no wood elf blood here lover,&quot; she whispered.<br>
<br>
His mind whirled.<br>
<br>
Hate<br>
<br>
His mother<br>
<br>
Disgust<br>
<br>
Lust<br>
<br>
Rhasine<br>
<br>
Her lips were on his. And he was kissing her hard. He shoved her back. Throwing her to the floor. Jerking at his belt. She leered at him and spread her legs wide.<br>
<br>
He was on top of her. Growling. Trying to thrust himself into her. Reaching down between his legs, trying to guide himself into her. But he was soft in his grasp. He clenched his manhood hard, trying to get it up. Throwing himself off her in frustration. He stood up rushing out the door. He buckled his pants as he slammed the door behind him.<br>
<br>
Rhasine's laughter echoing in the stairwell.<br>
<br>
A shroud of guilt seemed to hang on him as he ran through the city. It was late, but a few citizens still milled about. Staring at him as he dashed by. Finally he stopped, darting into an alley. He thrust his back to the wall. Panting. His stomach clenched violently. He wrapped his arms about his abdomen, bending over with the pain. Retching.<br>
<br>
Shuddering uncontrollably as bits of wood elf came pouring out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
Minz stumbled to the gates. Leaning on the wall as he made his way up the ledge. Pushing past the skeletal guards and out into the forest. <p>Minz Elandril<BR>
