Often times she would begin to write a song, but put the attempt away.  The words ran through her head but they would not form onto paper, as she would like.  But she never touched the lute.  The ladies watched her and wondered but figured that in time she would.  <br>
<br>
Everyday she watched the gate to see if the bard would return, but he still was away.  Her voice grew more golden with every day's use and the walls of the temple warmed to the sound of them.  <br>
<br>
The girl had her normal studies as well as her music, but no longer did they inspire her as the once did.  The teachers made sure she knew the faces of the leaders and the heraldry of the courts so she would not offend anyone some day.  They made her read the histories to know where her songs were based.  But most of all, they tried to teach her the ways of the world and of love.  They felt that the Goddess had brought them this child to teach their lessons to the world with her songs.<br>
<br>
She was nearing the age of eight, all long legs and constant energy when he arrived.  This would be the man to form her talent over the next years.  Without hearing her play or sing he could see the opalescent fire of the song in her heart.  <br>
<br>
He had a rare talent to be able to shape and mold minor talents into great bards but this girl's talent frightened him.  Instantly he doubted his ability to share anything with this rare child.  <br>
<br>
He walked up to her and bowed low as if meeting royalty.  His rich tenor voice issued forth his introduction, &quot;My lady, I am Brenson, minstrel of the Lady's heart.&quot;  He rose, his dark eyes sparkling with his newfound challenge.  &quot;You are but a slip of a thing, can you even reach a kitchen cupboard?&quot;<br>
<br>
He then witnessed the strength she possessed as she rose to her full height and addressed him &quot;I am near a woman grown good sir, and more than willing to reach any height set before me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed aloud and thanked the Lady and Bristlebane both silently for setting this challenge before him.  &quot;Well then, come and show me what you have learned.&quot;<br>
<br>
She sang for him, but she sounded just like the first bard had.  She didn't use her talent with the music at all, she sounded like one of the brightly colored birds with the talent for mimicry he had seen in the palaces.  His heart was crushed thinking that maybe the child would not be able to use her great talent, that it was too strong to be used.  <br>
<br>
The girl watched his face as she sang and saw the disappointment in his eyes and saw the brightness of her dreams crushed like a flower stepped on in the meadow.  Instantly her inner strength collapsed and her voice broke.  As she tried to sing nothing would come out and she reached for her throat.  Eyes wide she sat on the floor still holding her throat. <br>
<br>
The ladies felt the power in the room ebb and flow with the girls’ performance and they knew what was happening.   They had seen it in their training of the young magic users in their midst.  The control over her gift and her talent was collapsing.  A few of the more empathic women stepped forward but her new teacher sensed it to and moved to her.<br>
<br>
She dropped her eyes not standing to see the disappointment there.  He put a finger under her chin and raised her eyes to him.  “Never look away from me little one.”  He smiled as he continued, “You are a flower of talent that I am here to teach.  As such you must never hide your feelings from me.  Your feelings are the very base for your songs and if you take them out of your music then your audience will not feel the music.”  His face became stern then, “That’s what you did just now when you sang isn’t it?”<br>
<br>
The girl’s eyes filled with tears as she replied “I can feel others when I play and I didn’t want to frighten you.”<br>
<br>
He threw back his head and laughed, “That is your gift, or at least part of it.  When you are done with my training you will be able to sense what power you will need to use in your songs to help you.  You may need to prove to a merchant that you are a friend to ensure that your meager coin lasts.  Or, you may need to make an enemy lull into a daze so that you may flee.  And there are even times when you may have to defend yourself with your music.  You are very talented and I cannot wait to see the beautiful flower you become under my tutelage.”<br>
