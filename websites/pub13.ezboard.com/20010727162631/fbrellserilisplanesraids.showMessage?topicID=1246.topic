Woot - my first rant without a single joke.<br>
<br>
Gotta tell you, this makes me laugh.<br>
<br>
Here, you see, is a fundamental flaw in a democracy. No one wants to give everyone else the freedom they are given. All men are created equal.. well, all men except -- I am special, I can do this, but you may not!. Everyone thinks that they are the arbitrator of the can, and cannots and can impose their will as such. Correct me if I am wrong, but no one here is more deserving of something than someone else, I think we all cough up the same 10 dollars a month to play. <br>
<br>
To be honest, this thread is an embarrassment. People bitched when a level limt was placed on Vox and Naggy, its nice to know that you all can initiate one server wide as, and when you see fit..../shrug.. And if he does fail, I have news for you: that puts him no worse off than several groups in the rotation that have failed to put Trak down, which by your standards &quot;ARE&quot; Trakanon ready. <br>
<br>
Sorry friends, but you are not the inner circle, and this mythical dragon does not exist to provide you with loot on a regular basis. And if you deny him, then I will deguild and host the raid for him, which will garuntee its failure, but oddly, won't receive your scrutiny.<br>
<br>
I am dissappointed to read this from people I think to be of a higher calibre. Feel free to take your shots at defending yourself for this, but it's wrong, and the only thing causing people to tell others no is greed, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your game, and by God let others do the same.<br>
<br>
My next rant will be funny, promise. <br>
<br>
I'm outta here.<br>

<br>
The US decides that they have been fuqing over the indians for so long and now that we have a suplus we will give them some money to make up for our sins. To treat everyone fairly all tribes will get 10 million dollars and you qualify if you are 1/64th of that tribe.<br>
<br>
So now we go over to a large tribe, they have approximatly 10 million that apply for the 10 million for that tribe, so each person gets 1 dollar. Now we go to a smaller tribe which is almost non-existant and has only 5 people, wow they get 2 million each.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully this will help you understand what pov some of the large guilds are griped about.<br>

<br>
1. some people just want the lenght of the list shortened.<br>
2. some people feel that cause thier guild is larger should have more spots.<br>
3. some people see running thier own raid as the only way to get to go on one cause they never get picked.<br>
<br>
I myself like Aduns idea for the most part but the only problem i see is that there will still be people that get left out. there will still be people that are not asked to be sponsers and not picked to fill the extra spots. I am sure most of you would say &quot;so what thats thier problem not mine&quot; At least the current system does give them a chance to go by leading the raid themselvs. Ofcourse this is what makes the list long and the wait ungodly and will casue many people to cry unfair. To which they will respond &quot;thats your problem not mine&quot;.<br>
<br>
No i am not saying that i would do this..infact i probably will never lead a raid in my whole time playing EQ. But i can see why some will do this and can seriously relate to the situation that will motivate them to do this.<br>
<br>
Hmm maybe the fairest way and one that will surely shorten the list is to just take a lis of the classes that sign up and random the people out on raids. Each raid has set number of class types to ensure a suscessful raid. simply denote leaders and give them X number of wizards taken randomly from the list and X number of warriors and so on...removing people from the list as they get randomed out for the raid. Yes yes i know this would mean people would be raiding with strangers and people that there were unsure they could trust in key situations not to mention this would be basicly telling people who they have to take (and no i dont like telling anyone how to do thier raid ). But as i see it you will never please everyone i guess it boils down to what group do we want to please most?<br>

And I agree with Hethral if you cant get picked on a raid then its kinda your fault but not always. I play a class that can solo easily to lvl 50 but I raid all the time the main difference between me and other people is I spent alot of time making friends. The fact that you cant get picked to go on a raid doesnt mean you should automatically be able to host a raid which is why I like Adun's system you need friends to pull it off. If noone knows you then noone will sponsor your raid which will get rid of the people that sign their name on the list and basically have another person run the raid. If you cant get picked and still wanna lead your own raid then you should get some friends its that simple. <br>
<br>
To quote what Dennis Miller said &quot;Correct me if I am wrong, but no one here is more deserving of something than someone else, I think we all cough up the same 10 dollars a month to play.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sure we all pay 10 dollars a month to play but some people chose to take the easy route and solo to lvl 50. Is it my fault that they have no friends? Getting to the higher lvls and having met the friends along the way to be able to do all the high lvl raids and get your &quot;phat lewt&quot; is a right that anyone can achieve by just making friends. The bottom line is this noone is telling anyone what they can or cant do as anyone can solo to high lvls or they can chose to make friends along the way but their has to be repurcussions to your actions if you wish to be by yourself while leveling then I dont see why its a problem for you to be by yourself all the way to lvl 60. <br>

<br>
Dont get picked = dont have friends?  <br>
<br>
I dont think so.. it don't work that way pal.<br>
<br>
The General (not everyone does this) decision making process for selecting raiders follows something like this.<br>
<br>
1. Needed classes of appropriate lvl from guild/friends<br>
2. Needed classes of appropriate lvl from outside guild/friends<br>
3. Enhancement classes of appropriate lvl from guild/friends<br>
4. Enhancement classes of appropriate lvl from outside guild/friends who maybe subsorted by those who were left off of previous raid list as having priority.<br>
<br>
Has absolutely nothing to do with how soon you &quot;signed up&quot; for the raid, which is a common falacy also.<br>
<br>
There are many raids that simply put do not require certain classes... IE.. there is absolutely no reason to take Paladins, Rangers, Monks, Mages, Bards and Druids on a VS raid.  Sure you can implement those classes into the raid to make sure you give someone a shot at getting their greaves or other uber loot should it drop, but the &quot;needed&quot; classes, ie the classes that if you dont have will cause your raid to fail will always have priority over those classes...<br>
<br>
Example last Trak raid... there were NO Rangers or Paladins selected to go on the raid, even though nearly 10 of them signed up to go.  The raid leader understandably selected classes to go based on what is needed to accomplish the mission.  Many raids are led like this.<br>
<br>
Does knowing people help?  Yeah sure does... just about as much as being higher level than someone of your same class helps.<br>
<br>
And before people start in with &quot;Thats not how we select our raiders!&quot;  I am sure its not, and this dont apply to everyone, but is used as a sound general rule of thumb for many raid leaders. <p>Qualtar Shylok --

Yes theres abuse on our server by guilds and indies.  But would you rather it be spread out where you can get a chance or one Guild or two Doing it all.  Just look at how many Players indy guilds big and small have Epics have Planes Armor have VS gear Trak Raid Loot.  On many a server you would see a select few guilds in these items only.  Adun's systems helps more then it hurts (because you can never help everyone were all different) but after its in how long will it be till people says &quot;It's not working we need something new&quot;? <p>Maya Shadowdancer<br>

It might be something more like this.<br>
<br>
The US offers 10 Million dollars to all of the native americans everywhere.  The largest tribe steps forward and claim that 10 Million dollars all to themselves.  &quot;We have the largest tribe&quot; they say, &quot;We are most entitled to that money&quot; they say.  The smaller tribes ask if the larger tribes could possibly share the money equaly, divide it among each person?  But the larger tribes deny them.<br>
<br>
So instead the small tribes file a class action law suit against their own people and get the right to a portion of the money.  After the lawyers take their share the total amount left to split is down to 5 million and the native americans are left with nothing but a bad attitude and ill feeling towards one another.<br>
<br>
Everytime we have to come back to the boards and waste our time to discuss how we could &quot;fairly&quot; distribute spawns we simply loose out on the true enjoyment of the game.  You will never find a solution that makes everyone happy.  In my opinion some people are simply looking for one that will make themselves happy.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted to be fair maybe you would ask yourself how many times have I killed Vox?  How many times have I kill Trakanon?  When everyone else on Brell reaches level 60 are you going to let them catch up to you so that everyone has had a &quot;fair shot&quot; at these mobs?  Probably not.  <br>
<br>
I do not like the current system.  But I can promise you it is not the system that is broken, it is the people who are abusing it.   Fairness and respect are something that come from the person, not the system.<br>

<br>
What is happening is that there are a few very large and successful guilds that are now having to share the upper level mobs as the server matures.  They haven't had to do that in the past and now they are having to wait their turn.<br>
<br>
So, now they want to put artificial limits on who get to sponser raids.  <br>
<br>
First they'll put level limits on who can sign up for the raids. <br>
<br>
Then they'll put restrictions on the number of pickups you can possibly have by requiring a certain percentage of guild members to be part of the raid; independant raids will be a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
When that won't limit the number or raids enough to guarantee them enough raid slots they'll demand more slots due to their size.  One for you, two for me crap.<br>
<br>
Next they'll restrict people who can raid to those who have a proven track record with the uber mob.  Of course since you will never get to fight the mob in the first place, you are in a catch 22 where you will never qualify.<br>
<br>
Independants and small guilds will not be invited because they are classes that are not needed or there is not an open slot for them.  They've invited their friends to fill the 4 class slots that are open.<br>
<br>
The server will artificially revert to how it was 6 months ago with the upper level powergamers maintaining ownership of the uber mobs as the rest of the server matures to find they are shit out of luck.<br>
<br>
The little gives and takes that are happening to the current raid rules are heading this direction.  The most vocal advocates for the rule changes seemed to have realized their major rule changes just won't happen as quickly as they want.  Now the rights of the small guilds and independants are being chipped away a small bit at a time.  It's only time before the raid schedule will consist of only the largest guilds sharing between themselves.  I hope this is what everyone wants. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>  Posts: 1554<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/21/01 10:34:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/nillon.jpg height=306 width=162></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For everyone against indies / small guilds</span><hr size=1> &quot;The little gives and takes that are happening to the current raid rules are heading this direction.

I'll explain this very simply, under the current rules, 1 level 51 has the same rights as 40 level 60s, this is wrong, Adun's system ignores guild tags and that's the great thing about it. <p>nillon<br>

If Darkguard/MB don't have any wizards from outside our two guilds on our raid, we will fail.<br>
<br>
What you've outlined is what happens on most other servers.  Brell is fortunate that there's so much cooperation that goes on.  I think you have to be blind &amp; stupid to think that the large guilds aren't getting fucked over by our system.  I'd like to see it change, for 2 reasons.<br>
<br>
1-It's not fair to them.  It bugs me that the people who respect the scheduling system are getting screwed by it.<br>
<br>
2-The people that are hurt the most by the system are the ones that don't need it.  If VS was FCFS like most other servers, all of the large guilds would see him more than they do now.  You're the one that benefits from what we have now.  If people continue to childishly insist that things remain as they are now, and that any Indy person, or small guild can reserve their own raid with no qualifications, eventually people are going to start saying, &quot;Fuck this, I don't need to put up with it.&quot;  Once that happens, it's probably all over, not just for VS.<br>
<br>
Big guilds aren't demanding all the raids.  If that were the case, these boards wouldn't exist.  The fact that we're even discussing things, and the system hasn't fallen apart, even though there's a 7 month wait on VS shows that the big guilds aren't just in this for the greed.<br>
<br>
I want a shot at VS too.  But I want it to be something I deserve, as my portion, not just because I have a guildtag. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1246.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1249.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1265.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1246.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1246.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1246.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
