(A Pro/Con Discussion)</span><hr size=1> Ok recently I read several posts about a big nasty blow up around the Zordak Ragefire Spawn for the Cleric Epic. It seemed that someone was holding a list they weren't supposed to be doing and bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh...<br><br>Who cares really...<br><br>Anyway I want to start a discussion about the POSSIBILITY of turning Zordak Ragefire into a Moderated Rotation. Much like they presently do with Nagfen and Vox. Now I'm sure there are about a ton of pro's and con's out there for such a rotation and if it were ever to come to this there would have to be rules to it.<br><br>So what I plan to do is to set up what this 'Moderated Rotation' would look like and give a list of rules and then hopefully get your thoughts and comments on it as well.<br><br>Please when you post to this thread state first if you would be For or Against such an idea and then feel free to give any comments or explanation's afterwards.<br><br>Also understand that I'm not attached to either way of doing things. I see merit to both a Moderated approach and to the present Camping approach. On the moderated side it would mean less fighting and squabbling and on the camping it lends more 'value' to the epic itself. This is only a thought that I think needs to be explored and if it doesn't work/fit then we toss it out. If it does work/fit then we worry about how it would be implimented.<br><br>So here we go.<br><br><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *~*~*~*~*Zordak Ragefire - Moderated Rotation*~*~*~*~*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Statement of Purpose:</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>At present the Zordak Ragefire spawn is not only continually camped but is at present, a rare spawn that people are being forced to sit at for days if they wish to 'maintain their position' in the pecking order for Zordak.<br><br>     The purpose of the Moderated Rotation is to allow people to not only know when they are up for Zordak thus taking the guesswork out of 'who's next' but it's also to allow people with other commitments and Real Life things to attend to, to be able to fully enjoy not only the game, but one of the cooler aspects of being a high level cleric.

(A Pro/Con Discussion)</span><hr size=1> Being the most desired and most &quot;valuable&quot; epic, and considering the stupidity of the current quest, there is no good way to start, maintain, or moderate a list for Ragefire.  The main problem is that this is a one-shot deal.  You can't have a &quot;rotation&quot; for a list that doesn't rotate, so forming a list reverts to arguments over how to start it &quot;fairly.&quot;  Unguilded or small-guild clerics may be proponents of a lottery-based list because it ensures they get their chance at some point (possibly very soon), and the list would mean they don't have to camp for the insane 150+ hour periods we see now.  However, larger guilds are just in saying that they are willing and able to hold the camp for those long times, and that entitles them to special consideration, and they won't accept a list based on random distribution of spots on that list.<br><br>It comes down to this:  If you want your epic badly enough, you will sit as long as you can stay awake, or you will arrange with friends/guildies to take shifts, and you will wait there until it's your turn, and if you make it long enough, and have enough friends to come help kill Ragefire, you'll have your rez-stick.  If not, that's why they call it &quot;epic.&quot;  It's supposed to be an item that's obtained with an extraordinary effort.  You and I both agree that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> form</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that effort takes (camping for 150+ hours in a line that's sometimes 3, 4 or 5 people deep) is silly, but is beyond our power to change.<br><br>A list appeals to people that can't afford to undertake that camp.  However, there are still plenty of people who ARE willing to undertake the camp, and the system is working as it is.  If you doubt it, ask Ismena.<br><br> <p><CENTER>Feydakin Rainsong<BR>Wanderer of 52 Seasons<BR>Guild Officer<A HREF="http://droz.net/eq/azuresky">Azure Sky</A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/10/01 6:35:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/craig234/eq/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zordak Ragefire on Rotation?

(A Pro/Con Discussion)</span><hr size=1> Frankly, giving clerics one day to kill Zordak sucks.  Zordak should die within 2 hours of popping, allowing only time for people to get their butts to SolB, form groups and buff.  Waiting any longer only delays the next spawn by a day, because no one will ever rush to kill him when they have a day to plan and recruit.  If you want people to get their cleric epics faster, then kill Zordak faster, not wait longer before killing him.  There's a small chance that if he dies soon enough after Naggy is killed, you can get two Zordak spawns in a week (or there was, at one time... they may have upped the lower limit on the random spawn timer).  If you allow people to wait a day, you ensure that only one Zordak pops each week.  Plus you also run the risk of someone taking the spawn from under you, and no one would blame that person if you're off dicking around while Zordak is up the whole time. <p><CENTER>Feydakin Rainsong<BR>Wanderer of 52 Seasons<BR>Guild Officer<A HREF="http://droz.net/eq/azuresky">Azure Sky</A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useliah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>seliah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 7:24:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zordak Ragefire on Rotation? (A Pro/Con Discussion)</span><hr size=1> I agree with Fey on this. Giving one entire day only slows things down and the purpose of this is to minimize the amount of time needed to randomly sit in Sol B waiting for him to spawn and possibly increase the number of spawns by increasing prepairedness. (I.E. If you know it's your turn to do Zordak you'd more likely than not have the squad set to go on an hour or two's notice.) So my suggestion if this thing were to go active would be.<br><br>3.) The Cleric presently at the TOP of the list should be present in Sol B for the duration of their camp time until either<br>  A.) Zordak has spawned and they have killed him or<br>  B.) They have been bumped to the bottom of the list for whatever reason.<br><br>4.) If Zordak spawns the Cleric at the TOP of the list has 4 hours in which to gather their squad, buff and take Zordak down. This includes chatroom time. (I.E. Camping to Chat to save buffs and disucss strategy.) If 4 hours go by and the cleric is still unsuccessful in gathering the necessary people / resources / whatever then that cleric will be moved to the bottom of the list and the next cleric in line, and each cleric until zordak has been slain, will be granted 2 hours to prep a squad and kill him. Each person unsuccessful in gathering the necessary people in the allotted period of time will be bumped to the bottom of the list until someone is successful. (The reasoning for giving the initial cleric 4 hours and every one thereafter only 2 is during the 4 hour period of the first cleric the second cleric should have little problem quitely alerting people to be ready should the first clerics attempt fail. Thus the readyness factor is alot higher for each successive person after the first. The first of course SHOULD have people alert but in an unknown spawn time it can become very difficult to have people ready 24 / 7. Hence the extra 2 hours for the initial person.)<br><br>Thanks for everyone's comments thus far.

(A Pro/Con Discussion)</span><hr size=1> Well, I thought no one had been fooled by Jaharad's post, till I saw this one.  Seliah, yours is a very reasonable post, and I hope we can use it as a springboard to initiate some reasonable discussion about this problem, but I need to answer a couple of things you said in your first paragraph, concerning a list:<br><br>The brouhaha was started when someone I had considered a &quot;friend&quot; for well over a year hailed me from Ajahn's account.  He became abusive and began screaming at me for having the gall to let a family member sit at my computer while I got four hours' sleep on the -- what was it, the eighth day of my camp?  He insisted that I had violated the rules of the camp and forfeited my place in line.  (Pretty funny, isn't it, when he's hailing me from Ajahn's account?)  He called me a liar when I said I was now the person at the keyboard, called me a liar again when I said it would be me for the rest of the day, accused me of having been offline for six hours (the number later became four, then two, but was in any case patently absurd) and called me a liar when I denied it, called me a liar when I said I had been in line for eight days (his only evidence having been that he didn't believe such a thing was possible), claimed a cleric of &quot;his&quot; had been kept from camping Zordak, then claimed the same cleric had come to Sol B and checked to see if I was there and found I wasn't (another bald-faced lie), then switched to his own account to attack me further.  He insisted I had given up my place in line and that he and IV would FFA the spawn (thus ignoring the other three clerics also doing butt time down there).<br><br>After I put him on /ignore he came to Sol B and started /shouting at me (I wasn't aware of all the noise till I started getting /tells, &quot;Can you believe this guy?&quot;) and at everyone else in the zone that I was a liar and a cheat and had violated the rules when I logged off for hours at a time.  Everyone in the zone, most of whom were very tired of hearing me answer virtually every camp check (I may have missed one or two while we were clearing FG's) told him he was wrong.  Not even that stopped him, but he continued his tirade of /shouts.<br><br>I took him off ignore when I learned what was going on.  He filled my chatscreen with purple.  I soon began to realise that his real obsession was that he believed my guild and some other &quot;Uberguilds&quot; (IV is not uber?) were conspiring to keep people from getting in line to camp Zordak.  (One wonders how the heck we could have done that?)<br><br>Actually, the real problem started when a monk from Stasis, whose User was seriously ill and on an extended leave from work, camped in SolB and started helping the clerics clear fire giants.  I guess that meant that we were controlling something.  True, Tremmor had some names, and true, now and then he would hail someone and tell them, &quot;Zordak just died, the line is down to two, come get in line.&quot;  Not all the clerics were from big guilds; in fact several other clerics had got in the line never even having heard of the so-called list.  Then one very upset person hailed Tremmor and started ... well, I wasn't in on the exchange, so no comment about it here ... so he told her her cleric was twelfth on the list.  There never was a list with twelve names on it, but some people just can't help themselves when Maddie starts trying to bully them; they get a bit of a kick in provoking him.  (/apologise Maddie)  In reality, the collection of names started with eight and dwindled from there.<br><br>There never was an enforceable list; how could there have been?  There was a line, mutually enforced by the clerics in it.  I invited Jaharad to have &quot;his&quot; cleric come get in line, but he didn't want to be reasonable; he continued to insist we were keeping people off the list.  (Note that he never learned the difference between a &quot;list&quot; and a &quot;line&quot;.)  He also changed his story and insisted he didn't have a cleric, nor did he have anything to gain.  But he continued to batter me with accusations of controlling the list and keeping his cleric out of it.  (For God's sake, the IV cleric who is most ready for Ragefire just happens to be a dear friend of mine, Darkhealer, whom I would love to see epicified!)<br><br>Finally, he took his log of our exchange, HEAVILY edited it, and publicly posted it on the General Discussion here at prexus.com.  I had given him permission to post the log in its entirety including the screaming and accusations from Ajahn's account, but he omitted those.  He seemed to think that his case needed strengthening, so he took out many of the more neurotic things he said (you can tell when reading my replies that they are replies to something he said, but what he said appears nowhere), added a number of personal insults (he called me fat LOL), and posted it.<br><br>Somehow Jaharad seems to have expected that post to have brought the ridicule of the community down on my head, but it backfired on him.  People with a brain (that's most but not all of the people on Prexus) were able to figure out that an electronic image with no substance would be unable to keep another insubstantial image from going where it chose, given a little time.  No, we didn't park a troll at the entrance to keep the halflings from getting by and getting in line.  No, we didn't have the keys to either the front door or the back doors of Sol B.  No, &quot;we&quot; never ignored someone who had spent twelve days clearing fire giants with us, only to FFA his Zordak just because he had never heard of the list.

Let me just say I cried, I lost sleep, and I had nightmares.  I'm still waiting to hear one word of retraction from Jah or his guild leader, or anyone in IV, other than Darkhealer, who remains my friend.  Yes, Jaharad sent me one /tell: &quot;congratulations&quot;, to which I answered, &quot;thank you.&quot;  I guess that's all I'm worth.<br><br>Perhaps you should also know that a few days before that, I was hailed by a cleric who confided to me that she didn't have time to sit the miserably long camp, and that her only hope would be to get ingame first after the next patch to claim the front place in line.<br><br>This is the result of not having a rotation.  I feel very bitter toward the people who oppose it.

Other solutions have been proposed, only to be answered by your sneering.  Sometimes you do some actual thinking and contribute some good points to the discussion, but usually you just sneer and jeer.  By the way, I don't usually disagree with you.  I'm just tired of your tone.  It's mean-spirited and unhelpful.<br><br>And as for my 'taking anything up with Jaharad,' I tried to make it perfectly clear that such a thing is impossible.  He was incapable of listening, incapable of addressing the facts rather than his own fantasies, incapable of allowing himself to be disabused of his self-delusions.  Example:  Twenty people told him I had not been offline at all, and he continued screaming that I had.  That should tell you something about the futility of taking it up with Jaharad.  I am hurt -- hurt by my old friend, and hurt by everyone who is taking his side, which, judging by the silence from Backalley, Ajahn, Moonshine, and all the rest of IV, would seem to be everyone in the guild.  (Well, Darkhealer still speaks to me.)  Too bad you can't respect that.<br><br>My reason for telling my side of the story was to attempt to show one-sided, narrow-minded people (if the shoe fits) just how abusive this camp is.  I'm not the only cleric that has been subjected to abuse over this thing.  I think you're the one (maybe I'm wrong, not positive) who said you doubted that any bullying had gone on over disputing the spawn.  Bullying happened before I got my epic and a cleric was driven out by a large guild who parked a number of their members in Naggy's lair and claimed the spawn; bullying happened to me, though no one could drive me out (he just tried to trash my name publicly); bullying happened the day after I left there when some guild came in and attempted to move in on Auedyin and Cattany.  Cattany left because of it.<br><br>Often you have a point. Often you are even right.

Thank you.<br><br>Quote: The &quot;we need a list to make this less bad and more fair to clerics&quot; argument has, EVERY TIME, been shot down by the lack of a fair way to start a list.<br><br>This assertion has been made over and over and over by the anti-list faction.  It is an assertion without support.  It has been answered with a number of reasonable proposals, and every time, the anti-list people come back with the same assertion, &quot;there is no fair way to make a list&quot;.  I think this is what you are referring to as &quot;shot down every time&quot;, but simply insisting something is impossible when others have shown you several ways it could be possible isn't &quot;shooting down&quot; the opposition; it's just willful blindness.<br><br>Petoffen posted a very reasonable suggestion (Petoffen is always reasonable; whether you agree with him or not, he's reasonable); there may have room for improvement, but in all, it was quite fair.  I don't think the anti-list camp even addressed what he said.<br><br>Seliah started this thread with a very reasonable suggestion.  You haven't shot down her proposal, either, but you have asserted again that there is no fair way to start a list.<br><br>My proposal for a list (frankly, I don't like the idea of a list but it's better than the present abusive system by far) was posted in the general section a while ago when the moderator of a list on another server described how she handled her list.  She was definitely shot down:  the anti-list people yelled at her to keep her suggestions to herself, we didn't need no steenkeeng list.  (&quot;Shut up,&quot; in other words.)  Yet her list was eminently fair; so fair that the whole server agreed.  Was this really a 'shooting down' of her proposal, or a shouting down?<br><br>Finally, I'm willing to grant your point &lt;i&gt;arguendo&lt;/i&gt;.  So given that there be no fair way to start a list:  so what?  Let's start a list unfairly.

By design, it was not meant to be acquired by everyone that wants one.  We can all agree that the method Verant has chosen to limit the rate of entry of this item into the servers blows goats, but making a list doesn't just help the little guy who doesn't have a chance to camp 300 hours, it also hurts the guy who CAN camp 300 hours.<br><br>Let the people that CAN camp it for 300 hours get theirs now.

Ragefire will slowly become a target of opportunity, where people will pop into SolB, see that no one is camping, and will claim it.  If you can't wait, then I suggest you either get in line and start popping No-Doz by the jarful, or stop whining and realize that you are not meant to get your epic at this time. <p><CENTER>Feydakin Rainsong<BR>Wanderer of 52 Seasons<BR>Guild Officer<A HREF="http://droz.net/eq/azuresky">Azure Sky</A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaw0rm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>a w0rm</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://thew0rm.homestead.com/files/worm6.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/31/01 7:05:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://thew0rm.homestead.com/files/iv.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zordak Ragefire on Rotation?

It is obvious that more then one person is claiming the camp for 1 character in the game... <br><br>Macaxe says,  This is EXACTLY like for example I camp something and there were several people waiting after me.  I wanted to get some sleep... so, I asked a friend of mine in the game (different character) to take over for me - so, I could sleep.  So, that char comes over and says to the people on the list that he is holding the camp until I log back on.  Now in that situation there is no one on the server who would admit that is a legitimate claim on the camp... so, what is happening now with multiple people camping Zordak with one char is no different.  If you agree, this means that no cleric could possibly have a legitimate claim on a camp for over 160 hours.<br><br>Macaxe says,  IMO... the mob can be camped... with a list.  How would this work?!?  We all agree on a time that is reasonable for any one cleric (same person) to countinually camp (perhaps 12 hours perhaps 20 hours)... the point is we agree on what is a reasonable time to camp countinuously.  If we choose 20 hours the cleric can if he/she wishes to camp it for less time can and just pass the camp to the next cleric.<br><br>Macaxe says,  Now... if you are cleric one on the list (a list created by randoms seems logical)... and your time comes up.  You get to camp for Zordak for the alotted time... if Zordak spawns in that time you get your epic... if not, the next cleric in line gets thier shot at the camp.<br><br>Macaxe says,  You might be thinking this is nuts... but, what it does is give everyone a fairly quick shot at getting epic and also ensures that Zordak will be camped 24/7 and killed fairly quickly when he spawns which will help the entire server.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showMessageRange?topicID=150.topic&start=61&stop=62>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=150.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=150.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.threadControl?topicID=150.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=150.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm12>The Epic Quests</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- Begin BOTTOM AD Script --><div align="center"><script language="javascript"> document.write(adbottom); </script></div><!-- End BOTTOM AD Script --></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright 1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
