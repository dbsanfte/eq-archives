All was moving along well, the Dark Armies of the Empire had placed their boots upon almost every continent. From the night camps in the Western Commonlands, to the Lesser Faydark Detachment. From the Danak Outpost in Kunark to the Security patrols in Befallen and Najena. Only the frozen wastes of Velious was thus far un-occupied, but that would be remedied soon enough. Zirrix checked the troop organization charts and supply logistics. The military forces of the Empire had never been stronger and there were Teir’dal, or their agents, everywhere in Norrath. One of the most potent and visual representatives of the Respected Race was his own guild of the Violent Harvest. Through their constant efforts and campaigns, they had become even greater and more feared then the legendary Obsidian Blade. The Harvest went where it wished, destroyed it’s enemies whoever or whatever they may be. Dragons and Demons, Undead and Lightcrawler alike, they all fell to the will and hatred of the Harvest and Innoruuk’s power. Even the Demigods of other Planes of existence where not safe from the scythe of the Violent Harvest. Coming out of his revere, Zirrix looked over his plans once again. Soon there would be another punishment raid against one of the Lightcrawler cities. The memory of his recent attack on the city of Felwithe was still fresh in his mind. The Empire had come, led by the Harvest, and laid waste to the supposed “Sacred” city of the Koada’dal. The High Elven illusion of security had been shattered, and the Children of Neriak ( along with their allies) had washed the sheen of safety and protection of Felwithe away with the blood of it’s own inhabitants. He had been once again hailed as a hero in Neriak, as he had for his attack and occupation of the Feir’dal city of Kelethin. House T’Rhennic also won honors for the assault upon Rivervale, even though he had not commanded that campaign. Instead his brother the War Wizard Tzlar had assisted the Harvest, under it’s feared leader the Shadow Knight Creapiing, in slaughtering the furry footed little vermin of Rivervale. Alone in the darkness Zirrix allowed himself a rare smile of evil contentment and dark satisfaction. Rivervale, Kelethin and even shining Felwithe had felt the hatred and power of the Empire, and the will of the Dark Creator. Looking over the map, his eyes narrowed in contempt and anticipation. Who shall be next to feel the wrath of the Empire and the hatred of Innoruuk? So many targets to chose from, fortunately the Children of Neriak lived for a very long time. After a while, sleep came upon the General and he dreamed a dream of visions.<br>
<br>
Zirrix found himself in the Mansion of the Dark Father himself. It was a place of nightmares and pulsating hatred of all things. It took most of his will to restrain himself from drawing his weapon and charging out into the twilight, seeking to slay any and all he saw for Hate’s sake. Then, in his mind, he heard the voice of Innoruuk speak to him. It was not the same booming voice of Rallos Zek, but a low sibilant whisper of chilling effect. It told him that even though the recent Treachery of his fallen Daughter had been thwarted, he was still not satisfied. It would seem that, unknown to all mortals except the High Priest of the Temple, many here in the Plane of Hate had conspired with her against himself. Some had actually moved towards action, others had only thought to support the False Child. The Dark Father had decided to wait until he knew all the secrets that had been kept from him. Now, he had the full truth of it, and was ready to take action against those who had dared side against him. He knew in what contempt and disregard the denizens of Hate held the mere mortals of Norrath in. Thus, he had decided that he would call upon his Creations to enter his Plane and punish those of treacherous mind or wavering spirit. He would only call upon a few, some like Zirrix who were evil of soul and a true servant of his vengeance. Others, who harbored the seed of hatred and darkness (without their knowledge) deep within their heart, to be used as instruments of his will. As the voice faded, it commanded Zirrix to speak to the one he called Deathmistress, she would know the way.<br>
<br>
General Zirrix awoke suddenly, still seated at the map table in his command bunker. All was silent, yet his mind remembered clearly the instructions of the Dark Creator. It was then that he had noticed that his sword was gripped tightly in his hand, it’s blade gleaming with a sinister purpose. Standing, Zirrix left the Indigo Brotherhood’s headquarters and headed to the guildhall of the Violent Harvest. There he would meet with the Deathmistress Selilya, and learn what mission of vengeance lay before him in the Father’s own Plane…       <br>
