<br>
I've read a bit.  SOMETHING is happening, I do believe that much.<br>
<br>
Word is that last night Tunare was banished by Cazic Thule on Lanys server.  The newspaper in Rivervale prior to the last patch mentioned Lanys T'yvl searching for some sort of artifact the Teir'Dal regard as cursed, and I'd heard of GM events along similar lines.  It seems that forces are moving in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Of course I've also heard that Lady Vox will be attacking Halas, and Lord Nagafen will be attacking Rivervale... that the Claws of Veeshan will be attacking Greater Faydark and the Ring of Scale will be defending it.  *shrug*  Who can say?  Freshly out of 35, I'm just trying to stay out of the way.  If EVERYTHING I've heard of happens, I'd amount to little more than another victim.  I'll be holding up in Thurgadin until the whole mess blows over.  ;)<br>

I met this guy the other night and he's spent a lot of time in research.  Get a drink...this is a pretty good read.  Definately some weird times coming.<br>
Icknay <br>
53rd Level Druid<br>
Blood and Honor<br>
Veeshan<br>
<br>
<br>
Friends whoms names are too numerous to mention:<br>
 <br>
This email concerns the semi-recent and the recent up to date series of events that has been hitting Norrath for a while now. <br>
 <br>
So when did this all start?<br>
Bloody Kithicor, last year, if anyone remembers. Innorruk sent forth his daughter into Norrath to spread chaos and havoc. She succeded, and after a few bloody days, royally trashed EC, WC, Kith and Highpass. She also succeded in cursing Kithicor with hte Undead Night spawns. Last but not least, she managed to succede in opening a Portal to the Plane of Hate.<br>
 <br>
What she also managed to do was to get herself killed. And after that, you really don't hear much from the Prince of Hate camp for a while.<br>
 <br>
Jump ahead a few months into the future.<br>
A band of cheerful good-doers started to explore the jungle continent of Kunark. Unfortunately, one of them was abducted and held prisioner by an Iskar the name of whom I can't remember off hand. The thing here is, however, that it really upset her father (Who happens to be the King of High Elves) to the point that he started calling in favors from other races, sent an army across the seas and restablished the outpost named after his daughter: Firiona Vei.<br>
 <br>
The Evil Aligned sat back and watched this with growing interest. They set up their own little base on Kunark, allied themselves with Venril Sathir for power, money, new spells, ect, and the chance to continue to stick it to the Light Races.<br>
 <br>
In other parts of the world, a few months down the line.<br>
Around Qyenos groups of Rude Individuals started showing up. I can hear you sayit now, yes, it is qyenos, and everyone is rude over there. But these guys.. were a special breed. About the same time that they showed up merchants started getting the stuffing kicked out of them and general discord was experienced by all. Then, after a week or two, the Rude Individuals became Loathesome, and Specters started showing up in the Catacombs of Qyenos. Those whom were Loathesome started KoSing anything within reach. (and they tended to advance spawn: kill one, a bigger one would pop, until I was getting exp from them in my high 40's.)<br>
 <br>
Despite their best efforts the plot was discovered that they had tried so hard to conceal. Turns out that Bertoxxolous, the Plagebringer, the God With No Allies, had been trying to open a gate into Norrath from the Plane of Decay. The plot was foiled, and a few people were hanaged. (And a ranger was given an AC 50 shield as a reward)<br>
 <br>
Back in Kunark...<br>
Firiona Vei is released. Much joy is had by all. (Except those in the Outpost, who got a solid kicking for their involvement with Sathir)<br>
 <br>
In the Northern Desert of Ro..<br>
A band of happy go lucky Gnomes and Dwarves go exploring, and manage to find themselves a whole new continent. See what happens when you give them too much sugar? In the process of discovering this new world, they stumble across three new groups to be warned of: The Coldain, The Kromiff and Kromzek, and the Claws of Veeshan. Later exploring leads travelers to find The Sleepers Tomb, guarded by Dragons galore. The Sleeper, well, is sleeping. He's the offspring of Vox and Nagafen (and apparently Vox and Naggy shouldn't have mated, as it was that act that created this all powerful Dragon and got themselves thrown out of the &quot;new world&quot; to live as outcasts from the Ring of Scale), and insanely powerful.<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately a few months later the Guild Afterlife manages to wake him up. The Lead-Lead GM shows up and says somthing along the lines of &quot;Norrath is not ready to face the consequences of what you have awakened today.&quot; <br>
 <br>
That line throws up warning bells, does it not?<br>
 <br>
Then things go back into a calm, restfull state. Until...<br>
Back at Qyenos, the city of warm, loving, thoughtfull people, well.. they managed to find the High Priest of Bertoxxolus. And promptly hanged him.<br>
 <br>
This fact did not set well with the Plagebringer. To the point that he sent his influnce into the Karanas, spreading a massive Plague upon the land that corrupted the crops, the animals, and created a new breed of Bug: The Swarmers. But it was also at this time that someone else came back into play..<br>
 <br>
Lanys T'Vil.<br>
The daughter of Innorruk came back, in a different body but with the same mind and most of the same powers. Now, Neriak gets a little touchy on this. See, part of them beleive she IS who she says she is, while the rest think not (due to the new body). Even better, Inny's little girl had a falling out with Himself. He wants his powers to go to a new vessel on Norraath, she simply wants to keep them.<br>
<br>
What's more is that she is seeking out 3 parts of an ancient staff that terrifies even the Teir'Dal - and she has one part of it allready, after delivering a solid kicking of the Forces of Light.<br>
 <br>
And there seems to be one other, minor detail. Since she and daddy had a slight falling out, she has opted to choose a new Deity to give her allegance to (as it is rumored). His name is.. Bertoxx.<br>
 <br>
Good Old Bertie...<br>
As rumor and some evidence points, himself wants to open a gate into Norrath - and to hell with the Pact of the Gods that was to keep them in their own seperate planes. In essence,  he's thrown out the rulebook and because of this, everyone wants to play a bit and shape Norrath into their own image. <br>
 <br>
Runneye..<br>
This really doesn't hold much for the main series of events but it is worth noting. The Goblins of the Runneye Citadel have managed to throw out the Evil Eyes that have ruled over them for so long. And while they were at it they killed their king for his compliance with them. New management is in place, and this bodes ill for Highpass: the Pickclaw Goblins are at the heart of this chaos.<br>
 <br>
Permafrost..<br>
(From the In Development page on the EQ Site)<br>
**We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is released.**<br>
 <br>
And finially, Last Night.<br>
I missed part of this and I am waiting for the full log from a friend of mine (Biz, got off yer hiney and mail it to me) but the gist of what happened: FV and Tunare wanted to talk. Tunare showed, they chatted. then the Faceless (Cazic) spawned and took out Tunare (her avatar form, that is) and proceded to berate everonye in sight, until the players there took him out. (He went from 50% to 0 in 2 seconds. He also didn't have any loot)<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately he also managed to corrupt the Unicorn (FV's steed), in what way we're not sure. Hopefully after I get a chance to look at some of the logs I'll be able to say for sure what happened.<br>
 <br>
Unconfirmed Rumors.<br>
Unconfirmed by anything (yet):<br>
Vox and Nagafen want to get out and stretch their wings a bit, maybe roast a few cities.<br>
The Ring of Scale and Claws of Veeshan are really worried about the now-awoken Sleeper.<br>
Tunare has been banished / limited in power after last night.<br>
Bertoxx MAY be on the warpath from Qyenos to Freeport, not sure yet, this is the one I disbeleive the most.<br>
 <br>
Anyways, that's the short and skinny. This doesn't include what's going on with Lucin, but when I find out, I'll let everyone know. Hope you enjoy, please feel free to send this on to others who may enjoy reading this, or at least would like to know.<br>
