The head of the temple sent a message regarding their need for a fighter to teach the girl.  One day Vanthalorn appeared at the gate.  A tall and handsome human, with sandy hair and green eyes, but there was no warmth of the Lady in his glance upon the child.  He looked to be about 18 but he had no joy or laughter in his face.  The young girl instantly felt that he hated her.<br>
<br>
He sneered down his nose at her and told those gathered,  “I have been sent here to teach a young girl to fight?  Never have I been asked to do anything like this.  I have vanquished drakes and giants in the name of the Lady and now the temple asks this of me?  I will stay since my vows require that I teach others, as the temple requires.  But I wish to leave as soon as she has the basics and no longer needs me.”<br>
<br>
She really had no desire to learn weapons and was more than happy to see him leave as quickly as he wanted too.  She paid attention to his lesson as a good student should but he frustrated her by talking about things he had not broached in her classes.  He also was trying to teach her sword and shield, but she found the shield cumbersome and awkward.  <br>
<br>
She never complained about her teaching but one day Brenson came down to watch her progress.  He became furious seeing her being hit with a big two handed sword while she tried to duck down behind a shield that was almost as tall as she was.  He picked up a light rapier-training weapon and stormed onto the practice field.  The paladin looked up at him and gave an amused glance at his choice of weapons.  <br>
<br>
The bard took a defensive stance as the girl moved off the field rubbing a swollen spot on her shoulder where the paladin had connected with and overhand slash.  She watched closely as the bard moved quickly across the field staying just out of the paladins range.  He wove in and out piercing and attacking quickly then sliding out of the way of the other mans weapons lithely.  In her mind she saw the gracefulness of birds in flight in his fighting.<br>
<br>
Then she noticed something in the back of her mind.  She could hear him singing softly and moving in time to the song.  She heard a tune he had taught her and then captured a phrase of another.  She could feel the magic filling him as he fought.  The paladin was tiring as Brenton stayed relaxed a fresh.  <br>
<br>
One time he landed a good strike in the hole under the arm where Vanthalorn’s armor joined.  The paladin screamed in frustration and swung at Brenton’s head.  The bard just ducked the blow and grinned.  The younger man fell to the ground with the moment of his swing and Breton leveled the sword to right in front of his face, “Yield now.”  <br>
<br>
The younger man snarled but assented.  Brenton stepped back and offered him a hand up.  The girl could feel the strength and warmth of the bardic magic flow through him to the fighter.  Instantly, the fighter’s eyes grew wide and then wary.  “You aren’t just a minstrel are you?”<br>
<br>
With a chuckle Brenton replied, “I am a bard, there is a lot more to me than many will know.  I learned to fight from the greats of this land.  I have killed the white dragon of the north more times than I can remember and once I took a scale of hers to make myself a weapon.”  His glance turned stern, “But even I can see that you think that a person that doesn’t fight like you is not a fighter.”<br>
