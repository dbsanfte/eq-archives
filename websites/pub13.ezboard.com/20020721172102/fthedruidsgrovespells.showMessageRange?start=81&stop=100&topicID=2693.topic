<br>
Given a choice as a raid leader, if you had to choose between inviting a cleric and a druid, would you honestly ever invite the druid?  Your post explains how druids are needed for backup healing... well, the only reason that is so is because there aren't enough clerics to heal every one.  You say that the fire debuffs are vital... well yes, they are nice, as I said above... but keeping Breath on during a long fight is extremely mana-expensive, especially with fizzles, and our mana is better spent on even our lacking heal spells.  Furthermore, there is a necromancer dot/debuff which doesn't stack with breath, immolate, or both (I forget exactly) which debuffs more than ours.  I always Sunder, fixate, and disjoin.<br>
<br>
You claim that druids are more efficient for xp groups because you can get an extra rogue, and that when you group with a cleric, they are reduced to nuking.  Well I submit that instead of replacing the cleric with a damage dealer, the group would be more efficient if they went to a place with hard and fast pulls, and replaced the druid with a damage dealer.  CH is just too efficient to compete with, it eliminates all down time.<br>
<br>
As I said, I lead many of the raids for a guild which has killed pretty much everything, from Ventani to AoW, so I am intimately familiar with the uses of each class on a raid.  I also do a lot of xp grouping with my friends, and loathe soloing.  If my group is in a place where I suffice as the sole healer, there just arent enough mobs around or they are not all blue... at least, not the kind of groups that I enjoy.  But I'm not concerned as much with our groupability.<br>
<br>
I had written a much longer post debating point by point everything that has been brought up, but I don't think there's much more to be gained from it.  Either you are satisfied, or you aren't.  The fact is that most high end druids are not satisfied, and that the sentiment is much higher in druids than the average class... one wonders why that is, if there isn't truly some lack. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/16/02 5:57:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2693.topic&index=83>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nature's Recovery</span><hr size=1> re: pet buffage, from 1-10-02 patch message &quot;- Clerics, wizards, and druids can buff their own pets/familiars again&quot;.  the problem is in lumping druid pets in with cleric pets and familiars, when they should be viewed as magician/necromancer/enchanter pets instead.  they are a true pet, no matter how low level.<br>
<br>
and yes, i know we can debuff cold, however NOT in any situation that we would be using moonfire, since we would only use it when wildfire, and thus fire, wont hit.<br>
<br>
more suggestions....<br>
<br>
address the issue of the serious lack of druid only items at the high end level.  everyone wants something &quot;just for them&quot;, druids are no exception, and nearly everything we get we share with either other priests, or all casters.  this is an extreme issue for druids since clerics share in plate/chain items and shaman share in chain items, yet there are virtually no high end leather class items that druids get a share in.  for instance, concerning high end bps, there is nothing priestly (wyvern isnt priestly) beyond velious quest bps for druids, yet shaman can wear vindi and RoF, cleric can wear those plus superiority, true mithril, and sal'varae's.<br>
<br>
NToV SHIELDS: our shield is worse in comparison to all the class shields dropped in ntov.  all other shields have 40 ac where ours has 33.  all other caster shields have a higher combined total of hp/mana.  for instance in comparison with the shield for CLOTH wearers, our shield has 7 ac, 20 hp 30 mana, and 8svall LESS.  lets not get into the issue of wearing a frog on your arm, thats bad enough, but having the robie shield with more ac and over twice as much to resists is painful.<br>
<br>
NEW NUKE: im probably dreaming, but i would like a new nuke (not moonfire unless they drastically change it) so that my versatility in the high end game is a bit more pronounced.  most druid roles in raiding involves primarily healing, would be nice to see a high damage, decent ratio nuke (little better than wildfire) that would give us the alternate option to healing that we were suppose to have.  perhaps a nice indoor magic based nuke since we dont have one of those, since it doesnt really fit into any storyline why we cant cast magic based spells indoors.  it would also make not too powerful an increase since more things resist against magic than fire.  something so that if i unload my whole mana bar, its actually worth losing the healing potential.<br>
<br>
ANIMAL SLOW/MEZ:  they seem intent on giving us animal based spells, so i'd like an animal slow or mez.  necros are undead based and get the same lines of spells we do for animals (sense, banish, charm, fear, invis to), and they get an undead slow and mez as well.  animals are in short supply to begin with, this would make it a little more worth seeking them out for hunting.  maybe even a fixed duration charm like necros have for undead would be nice. <p>-K<br>

<br>
Yah NToV sheild (see .sig pic).  It's a &quot;good&quot; sheild but it certainly isn't on par with the rest of the class specific sheilds.  Looks like newbie crap too...   but then yet the cleric sheild looks like newbie crap too.<br>
<br>
Nuke - an ice debuff would be nice.   IMO an ice debuff that is built into the fire spell doesn't count.  If I have to fire debuff a highly fire resistant mob to the point where fire will land just so I can get the ice debuff part in just so I can cast Moonfire.  ummmm.....  /boggle.  Just make a straight forward Ice debuff like Ro's Sundering so that Moonfire is at least a doable thing.  Also it would be nice if Moonfire actually was in game.  heh.  <br>
<br>
Mask of The Stalker/Moonfire - need to actually be put in game.  /smirk  <br>
<br>
Remove Greater Curse - Would be nice if this dropped a bit more.  I agree and my guild (clerics/shamans/paladins) all agree that this spell would be best used on the druids first to give them something to do on raids.  I presently have Remove Curse which is nice but casting it 2 or 3 and sometimes 4 times on 1 person is no fun :-).  For the number of classes that want this spell and for what it does for a raiding high level druid would be nice to see this drop a bit more.  <br>
<br>
Pet Debuffs/Slow etc - yep these make sense and are in line with what druid do.  We have a animal tash, fear and charm, would make sense to have animal only slow and maybe a mez with some pretty strong restrictions.  I could see a &quot;mez&quot; where the druid becomes busy feeding the animals treats to keep them happy.  :-)<br>
<br>
The other thing I keep forgetting is   ROOT/SNARE.   Snaring has always been the druids highest used spell.  Groups always want druids for snare.   Why did wizards get a lure based version and druid got none?   Druids really should have gotten a lure based snare.   There are PvP issues here I am sure.  It should be doable to make the lure snare only castable on NPC's and not dueling PC's.  Also it would be a GREAT thing to have those &quot;Immune to Snare&quot; mobs, be NOT immune to lure based snare.   Lure Based snare would be a level 60 spell of course.<br>
<br>
SoL group gates and TL to bind/druid rings.   Just makes life easier for everybody :-).  A lot of groups I see are leaving the druids behind and getting a wizard in SoL.  That way when the group is done they can all get TL's to Nexus or bind or where ever.   It's also quite sad on raids now that I just mem my self gate spell and leave.   The wizards do all the work now when raids are over for the night.   Grats Verant for destroying one of the ways druids used to help people out.   On the bright side, I haven't been bugged for a group gate hardly at all anymore.  Once in a while I'll get asked for a group gate to the Nexus tho.   :-/<br>

<br>
I've long since stopped playing my druid due to the fact that all our spells were handed to others and either equaled or better. Wizards needed help, well lets give em lure snares and great aoe's, lets give shamans sow +fire first but not druids, lets give shamans group regen, our porting availability went out the window with the coming of TL's and Luclin, Luclin was the real killer. Who the heck wants to port down and wait for ride up when they can get a tl to shad haven or nexus evac instead. Tanks with 6k hp dont want heals for 900 when mobs are hitting them for 250+ per swing. Lets give clerics self only PotG but not druids. Lets give clerics a different version of damage shields with MoK type spells. Druids have long since dropped from top list of soloers. Nowdays Shamans/Necros/Wizards/Monks can solo better than druids. Sure we can quad but with insane down times, hell a monk can just mend himself up get up and continue hitting while the fungi keeps him healed while wielding 15/18 like weapons that drops off insanely easy to kill mobs. Druids soloability in Luclin took a major hit with nearly unrootable mobs that could of kept us at least in the soloing contention but cant do that anymore due to the fact that is overpowering. Ya, why can a melee class solo better in FG than a caster that is supposed to be one of the top solo classes in the game.  Yes we are usefull in many ways, but the sun set on the druid class long time ago and all we get is trickets now while many others flourish.<br>

Main reason to have druids now is if you dont have enough clerics or shamans there.  The AC debuffing helps on some of the Luclin mobs, but for the majority of raid level mobs it isnt necessary or that noticeable when the tanks have good gear.  The main thing people want are spells that make druids highly desirable as raiders - with shamans getting regrowth of grove and clerics getting self-only POTG in Luclin and group aegolism, there's even less of a role available.<br>
<br>
Trevize presented some nice ideas, but I have the feeling Verant isnt going to do much for druids other than change some of the existing spells.  For Moonfire, how about making it like the old level 49 Ice/Fire spell - since it so mana inefficient how about having it debuff cold resist too.  For Mask of the Stalker, it should at least be a little better than mask of the hunter to warrant taking up a 60th level spell slot - how about increasing the mana regen by 1 or giving 100 extra mana.  For Nature's Recovery (which this thread is about, heh), make it stackable with regrowth of grove and celestial healing spell line, and have it do the 900 healing in a minute and half with a 30 second recast time - this wouldnt step on celestial healing toes but would help give a little extra healing.  Wouldnt be out of line since clerics/shamans/paladins are already far better healers for AOE mobs. <p>Fayne Dethe<BR>

<br>
RE: MASK:  not only is this a rehashed spell, its rehashed for shorter duration and more mana cost, for a spell that SHOULD have been indoor capable in the first place.  the days of giving druids non-movement-speed outdoor only spells should have been long gone with kunark and certainly by velious, when the great majority of high level hunting places were indoors.  especially when it comes to self-only mana regen since none of the other classes have their mana regen limited in any way.<br>
<br>
PB AEs:  druids need an upgraded PB AE.  we are crippled for ae groups with only the extremely poor ratio earthquake line.  with the introduction of melee soloing zones, a lot of casters are resorting to ae groups, both out of desire and neccessity.  the druid is seriously crippled for ae groups as their pb aes are extremely poor ratio with the best one being 1:1.16.  sure, we get along with it if we have to, but if you can get a wizard or magician instead, their ratios are 1:1.44 to 1:1.89.  something along the lines of a 1:1.5 ratio would boost our desirability for ae groups without infringing on the power of the magician (who's best ae is 1:1.68) and still not coming close to the wizards ae supremacy. <p>-K<br>

<br>
Anyway...  The point I felt I should contribute to this thread, that may or may not be valid:  Lotusfly, you mentioned that in xp groups, you frequently don't need a cleric.  I get the impression from bits of your posts that you and those you hunt with are either in or involved with an uber-guild (I really hate that phrase...), and this suggests to me that the melee types in your groups are probably very well equipped.  This may make the difference between needing clerical heals and being able to make do with Druid heals.  If the tanks aren't taking significantly less damage because of their equipment, they'll be much less reliant on their healer.  Assuming this to be true, it's great for you and your groups, but other, more modestly equipped melees may not be able to survive on a Druid's heals, and might very well need Clerics.  Then again, maybe I have no clue what I'm talking about.  As stated above, my Druid is only 24.  My only other toon is a level 8 Bard, so I can hardly be said to have any experience in the endgame.<br>
<br>
One other thing that just sounded wrong to me...  You said that when you have a Cleric in the group and you're covering heals (as a Druid), the Cleric is frequently reduced to nuking for lack of work.  Wouldn't it make more sense to have the Cleric covering the heals, and the Druid doing the nuking?  Particularly since Druids are much better nukers.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's the opinion of someone who can't keep his mouth shut even when he knows he probably should. =) <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>

Is this working as intended, or a stacking exploit, considering Fixation and Disjunction don't currently stack on their own?  Would it be possible to get Disjunction and Fixation to stack without tricks?  That'd be cool, considering Disjunction can land fairly well on its own after Malo and Occlusion.<br>
<br>
--animal mez and slow<br>
The necro undead slow is great in places like the Grey.  It would be fun to venture into Siren's Grotto with a couple new tricks.  Animal mez would make sustained charming a much more viable option.  Is there any chance druids will see these spells?<br>

<br>
I was able to keep a group of 5 (4 rogues + myself) alive with my BP Regrow and NR stacking with light heals tossed in during Vulak last night.  This also included /assist healing on the warriors throughout the battle.  Ended the fight with 1/2 bubble of mana and all the rogues above 50% health.<br>
<br>
I'll be using this spell now.   :-)<br>
<br>
Also our Shaman thinks I'm god now.  Torpor, Regrow, NR and he's a mana/buffing machine.<br>
<br>
Now....  about Moonfire and Mask of the Stalker not being in game YET.   sheeeeesh.<br>

<br>
Ports: I actually feel very sorry for wizards now. They basically have to TL out 35-40 people on any given raid by themselves. Think about those that can't port. They are screwed if they need to leave and there's no wizard around. My guild is a small one, but we have 3 other small guilds that are an extension of our own and we raid with them constantly. Btwn our 4 guilds, we probably have 1 porter (me) that show up on raids 99% of the time. We do have a few other wizards and druids, but not enough to fill the porting roll for any given raid. If they gave druids SoL ports, it would make a lot of people happy and life much easier for everyone. I would love TL's but fat chance, so won't even go there :)<br>
<br>
PoTG: <br>

You begin to cast PoTG<br>

<br>
It's a no brainer, that this should be fixed. Either give us single target or make it stackable.<br>
<br>
Circle of Seasons: Fix the stacking issues.<br>
<br>
Ro's Smoldering Disjunction: Remove the 150 dd. I can't even debuff a rooted mob without root breaking due to the dd. It would also be nice to be able to debuff a mezzed mob like almost every other debuff spell.<br>
<br>
Epic: Let our epic stack with Necro's epic. Whatever they have to do (remove snare..whatever), I don't care, but my epic effect is useless around our guild necro's.<br>
<br>
Address these issues and I'll be happy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukytelae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kytelae</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Love the Grove</span><br> <font color=#333399>(1/24/02 6:53:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2693.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.river.org/~jnfr/EQ/mtg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nature's Recovery - The changed version</span><hr size=1> Lotusfly, I tried to send a private message to you since your email isn't listed, but they don't really seem to work here. I wonder whether I could copy your post (with attribution) to our private guild board, where some of our druids express distress over lack of the role for a druid at upper levels. <br>
<br>
I'm talking about your post describing possible roles of course. I think it makes an excellent starting point for discussion. <p><small>

Yeesh - this thread has really taken off!  Look what you've done, Lotusfly, you heretic! :p<br>
<br>
Ok Lotusfly - you made a point about this spell: it is controvertial, but the recent adjustment in the stacking issues, combined with some excellent research, make you the vindicated heretic.  Actually, only partially vindicated, because the jury is still out on the adjustments (pending further testing).  Let me add a few more (preliminary) conclusions/questions I would like to make:<br>
<br>
1) You seem to have inside information that other people do not seem to have, such as the &quot;hint&quot; that stacking may be adjusted... ok - just pass along the server IP and port number and we can take care of the rest.<br>
2) Just what is (or will) your dissertation be on, if not Everquest?<br>
<br>
