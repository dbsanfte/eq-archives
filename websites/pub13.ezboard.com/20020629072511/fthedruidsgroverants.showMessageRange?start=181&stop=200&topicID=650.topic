valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cleric healing abilities.</span><hr size=1> I applaud druids getting together as a group and voicing their concerns.  I would just like to say one thing, as I read through the note.  When you request changes, be sure to consider the consequences on other classes throughout the level cycle.  The thing that stood out for me was the request to have the cleric benefits lifted.  <br>
<br>
As a mid level cleric (32), those benefits are the only thing that I'm aware of that make a better healer than druids and shaman (and being better than shaman is debatable).  We (the priest classes) are all using Greater Healing.  At my level, it's tough to edge a spot in some groups as it is (why have a cleric when you can have a druid that can do so much more for the party).  If it weren't for my better healing, I'd only get invited if people expected to need rez's <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Before I get tons of flames (although I still expect 'em), let me emphasize that I understand the concerns voiced are in the high end game.  There are a lot of classes expressing frustration with the high end game, and Verant seems to be chucking more and more high end content in all the time (without really addressing the issues at hand).  Just don't get too bent out of shape if their solution doesn't involve taking away the benefits of other classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uniliamann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niliamann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 9:44:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=182>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://selphie.org/images/forum/avatar/ff9-vivi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sobe: Conversation: What about Us!

<br>
Just a few things I'd like to touch on, as most of these changes that are wanted are good.<br>
<br>
First, heals...Indeed, druids should be given a better heal.  Druids can keep someone alive in a group, but its not very mana efficent from what I've heard.  But one of the earliest posts suggested that all priests get a heal for 3000...If this was intended to be a single target heal, /bonk.  For one thing, while many mobs can deal out over 3000 damage in 6 seconds, many can also not...This would make CH useless on many mobs, and giving it to shamans druids and clerics would make it too easy to keep someone alive.  CH chains would become very useless, you'd have 3000 point heals landing on someone every 1 second, and thats only if you had a total of around 8-10 shamans clerics or druids total, after debuffs and all.  If this heal was meant as a group heal, i got nothign against it :P  I still think the druids healing ability needs to be raised some, not just that much.<br>
<br>
Second, i think the only other big issue i remember is the luclin port.  I for one do not think that should be added, unless its to the middle of a spread out zone somewhere in luclin, and only if its an evac spell, only usable on luclin  Why only that?  Because druids can only port to druid rings (given that they cant port to some that they should be able to, like gfay).  There are no such things on luclin, only the combine spires, which have always been used only for wizards.  Verant was only considering that high level wizards would be able to port to luclin, which they cannot do, minus the AA thats a 1 second gate there..ooo...They can port to luclin from luclin, so technically they're not porting to luclin, real special considering most of those needing punts to the nexus would want to go there to get back down to norrath, and most peopel are bound on norrath or bazaar/shadowhaven/nexus.  Really, i think luclin wasnt that great of an expansion)<br>
<br>
If verant had made changes to the 'well created class' they had in the beginning, chances are its because they saw that they had overpowered the druid class, not because people whined about it.  Druids are falling back into the 'jack of all trades' category nicely.  Try to get one thing improved, not many druid aspects improved...I would like to see the druid class made less of a 'jack' and more of its own duty (don't ask me what, i'm just a dumb nuker), but if verant wants them to be the jack, then theres nothing wrong with being 3rd in this aspect, and 3rd in that.  I see a few posts complaining about being 3rd in an apsect, saying they should be 2nd, like they have a right to it.  Well, jack of all trades would be like having 4 bachelor's degrees, while a master of one area has a phD in one, but something else, like the mage i guess, has a masters in two (nuking and pets? :P only other class i know much about is the chanter).  Don't try to become the master jack of all trade's, i doubt verant will let it happen.<br>
<br>
As for soloing easy, big deal, many classes can do it.  Though the 3 most thought of are wizards druids and necros, others can do it just nicely, like a higher enchanter can kill 5 at a time with charm and debuffs...Only reason people say druids got it so easy, is cause thats who people see the most of in the kiting area...why? cause there tends to be more druids than any other class.  And clickable items like ES arms, that arent really worth it by the time you're 45 i hear.  Something around 300 total damage for the 5k mobs?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As i have said though, some of the changes that have been suggested in the petition do need to take place, heals being the main one imo.<br>
<br>

(While people think of us wizards as hating druids, its generally in the apsects of ports in an auction zone:P  Competetor A hates Competetor B and vice versa)<br>
<br>
<br>
If i didnt read the rules or i did something not allowable here, let me be the first to bonk myself, just make a character on my server and send me a tell :P<br>
<br>
(BTW, whats the druid name of the gate/port to DL? if it doesn't have combine in it, though i'm sure it does, for roleplaying reasons you probably won't get a port to any civilized area in luclin, cause the port to luclin was made up of the combine empire, and though every class was in the combine empire, it used spires.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uniliamann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Niliamann</A> at: 4/8/02 6:59:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 9:49:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=183>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tesque: Why the petition won't work.

<br>
That is because you haven't had to deal with a raid tougher than Planes/Vox/Naggy at level 52.<br>
<br>
In the high end game, clerics are focused on keeping that MT, or the Rampage Tanks alive.  They are not and cannot be worried with trying to keep a group alive. <br>
<br>
That is what the Druids are supposed to be there for.  But we can't do it anymore.<br>
<br>
Yes...Druids should get a Group Heal..and probably a Group heal better than Clerics.  Why? Because a Cleric has very little use for any group heal spell other than Group CH.  Oh yeah, you forgot to mention that Clerics have Group CH... <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

I now have a 60 cleric and can get group's anywhere. but i still regret i no longer play my druid for it's lack and inability to solo now at high end. heal at high end game or even port people in luclin expansion. i played the druid because if i couldn't find a group in amount of time i have to play i could alway's go solo a few mob's for exp. this is no longer true. i can go thru a whole mana bar trying to kill one mob and still not even have it half way down in health. i would love to see somthing done so i can play my druid again.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 10:02:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=186>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is about the endgame.</span><hr size=1> Aidon, Group CH's spells are not all that common of a drop.

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;I cannot see the logic in giving a druid, primarily a solo class a group heal&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
We're primarily a solo class?  That's news to most high end game druids.  In fact about the only time I bother to solo is to farm tailoring supplies or faction.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Again i cannot see the logic in giving druids port spells to the moon, last i checked there wasnt any druid/dragon rings there, a moon essentially being a sphere with little to no animal/plant life would have what connection to a druid&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Have you done much exploring of the moon?  Zones with lots of nature in them:  Shadowhaven, Dawnshroud, Maiden's Eye, Shadeweaver's Thicket, Grimling Forest, Hollowshade Moor, Tenebreous Mtns, Twilight Sea, Umbral Plains, Marus Seru, Mons Letalis, Scarlet Desert.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;But i definately could see a luclin cast only evac to nexus.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
This is, actually, what we are asking for, or if not the Nexus, to some natureiffic zone on the Moon.  Personally I do think we should be able to port to the Moon from Norrath, but so should Wizards, currently neither class can.<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ruids have always been and will continue to be a desired class, even if its only for your ability to track and locate and gank named mobs in various zones&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The number of named mobs that are worth killing at my level, that wouldn't obliterate me are very very very very very slim.  The high level end game isn't about raiding because the mobs are easy enough for Druids to solo.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I cannot see anyone saying, yanno it sucks to be a druid; with my ability to outrun, track, and kite spawns that no one else is aware is up atm. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
&lt;cough&gt; Summoning Mobs suck.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;As far as people griping about your role on raids, you knew what your class was when you chose it, the reasons you chose it were your own, accept the limits verant has placed on you and get over it&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>

<br>
NR does 900 damage vs Torpor's 1200 and NR costs 50 mana more.  Suitable trade offs for not having the snare/slow effects of Torpor.<br>
<br>
&gt;I don't understand why druids feel they can't be successfull secondary healers on raids. Druids are the best raid healers other than clerics. No other class gets a single target instant heal spell that heals that much. The other secondary healers have to rely on heal over time spells that do not stack and cannot be chain cast. This means that druids can heal more by chain casting than the other secondary healers, and that druid healing stacks better.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Read the petition again please.  Or read it period.  The reasoning for the request was detailed extremely detailed.<br>
<br>
BTW, Nature's Touch and Chloroblast have the same ratio.<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ruid nuking power is just fine.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Again, read the petition.  We never asked for an increase to our nukes.  We asked that they fix Moonfire so that our level 60 cold nuke didn't have a worst mana efficiency than our previous cold nuke and slower cast time.<br>
<br>
Verant subsequently has done this.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;At level 59, paladins will have a heal over time spell with greater mana efficiency than chloroblast, but that advantage dissappears one level later.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Again, the level 60 Nature's Touch spell is the exact same mana ratio as Chloroblast.  Neither of them, however, can compare to a paladin's group healing.  Read the petition.<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ruids heal just fine on raids&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Yes they do, so long as you don't want to heal on any raids tougher than HoT, West Wing, and maybe NToV.<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ruids have the best fire and cold resist buffs of any class. They have the second best damage shields.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Rare do you find a high end raid that doesn't have at least one Mage there.  End result? Druid DS's are useless.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I would caution you not to draw the eye of Verant's balancing team, I do not think you would like the results.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Eh? What more can they do to us /snicker.  Druids are dropping like flies already.  We are broken, whether you have the obversational prowess to see it or not is immaterial.  We are and I'm sure the Dev Team will recognize this.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> To those who say Druids are &quot;powerful enough&quot;, try playing a druid to 60.  There are a lot of things that we really are lacking and we are adressing them as i am sure you would or will in your boards. <br>
  Just to give an example, I have seen 3 mages in my guild quit the game because the class is boring at high levels. they are only used on raids for CoHs and summoning Mod rods/Focus items/what not. My friend has completly given up on the class because he is sick of it.<br>
  As to druids, The only way i seem to be able to get exp is if I solo, Noone wants my buffs as you can get better from a cleric or a shaman. Noone wants my nukes or use me as a porter since they can get a wizard who nukes harder and can translocate individuals to where ever, especially when it comes to luclin.  Healing? heh you read the post. Why have a druid who is in last place behind clerics, shamans, Paladins!(Sorry, but in my eyes at least we shouldn't fall behind Pally's). whats that leave us with? snare. Well if you have a Shaman a wizard and a cleric  why would you need another healer/caster? Get a Ranger. one less person with mana down time and since they don't have to taunt, there is no need to heal them. hell get a warrior with a snare whip. with a shamans buffs he will proc that thing in no time. that leaves you with 2 spots left open. in a 6 man group if you go with a ranger then grab a enchanter/bard and you are set. Go with the warrior and you can get a Rogue and an enchanter. no need for a druid at all like that. Whats that leave us? Doing the one thing that everyone complains the most about when it comes to Druids, Quading. Heh I am personally sick of that. \<br>
<br>
The only other thing i would like to see done for a druid is lightening up some of our armors. Not to long ago Castersrealm had a news article up about beast lords complaining about there armor not having enough ac. Verants responce was &quot;that is the negative of wearing leather armor, but the bonus is its light weight.&quot; or something along those lines. ( i will look for the article in the archives). Heh so if the benifit of wearing leather armor is light weight yet having a low ac, why are my Vermaculated boot that have  6ac weigh 6.5 lbs?  indiculite boots for Warriors have 20 ac for 4.9 weight. Now I am not saying that ours are the same but last i checked Metal was heavier then leather. Just drop the weight to a more respectable level on all our lower end armor.  and one last thing on that, how about some armor in the main lands that falls in line with Temple of Ro's armor the stuff in luclin is nice but something on the main continents would be more suitable. I know too much to ask for but at least take a look at the weight of the armor we do have. <br>
<br>
Edit:<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4031">eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4031</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Maybe i just read too far into it before but it certainly looks that lighter wt is a bonus of wearing leather.<br>

<br>
Give me one example where a class gave up an ability while Verant was balancing them and improving them.<br>
<br>
What did Shamans give up to get the Torpor/Canni combo?<br>
<br>
What did Monks give up to become soloing gods?<br>
<br>
What did Rogues give up to become the undisputed masters of melee damage?<br>
<br>
What did Warriors give up to become the god like beings they are now compared to my level 50 warrior pre-kunark?<br>
<br>
What did Rangers give up to get the ability to survive their damage output?<br>
<br>
What did Wizards give up to get Lure nukes and Bane nukes?<br>
What did Wizards give up to become the Masters of Travel?<br>
<br>
What did Clerics give up to get the Celestial Line and group heals?<br>
<br>
What did Paladins give up to become better healers than druids?<br>
<br>
What did Hybrids give up to have their XP balanced?<br>
<br>
What did Necros give up to have their group tap spells?<br>
<br>
Shall I go on?<br>

This isn't a matter of trading in something for something.  This is a matter of bringing the Druid class up to par with the rest of the game. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;<br>
Druids are a Support Class.. Their Job is to Assist heal.. not to totally heal a main tank to full... or any tank really for that matter.. <br>
&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Who's talking about healing MTs?  I'm talking about trying to keep a group of casters and non tank melee alive.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;firstly... you have to realize the efficiency between heal over times and direct heals... secondly.. you shouldnt be letting a tank fall down 4400hp&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I'll tell the mobs to stop AEing/Riposting the casters and damage melee in my groups when they get down 1khp...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Secondly Torpor has a slow effect, making it undesierable by meeles.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Not that undesireable in a raid situation, and certainly more desirable than being dead.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Get your facts strait on Celestial Elixer.. its 300 mana and heals 1200. (and its 28 seconds... 4 second cast, 24 second HoT)&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Caster's Realm is wrong.  Ask a level 59 cleric.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;you said it yourself.. S.E.C.O.N.D.A.R.Y healers... get used to that... you are assist healers... you are NOT a healer for a high level raid any more&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Well then I guess you all are screwed, since its always the Druids who are told to be the secondary healers.  Do you understand what a secondary healer is in a high end raid?  Its the people keeping everyone who isn't a MT or Rampage Tank alive, since that is what the clerics are focus'd on.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;if you want to talk grouping... at 60 .. NT is a viable heal.. my friend (60 monk) and his 60 druid can solo D1 in seb very easily for hours on end using NT. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
This petition was on discussing the high end game, i.e. raiding.<br>
<br>
Duoing D1 isn't high end.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;you want to heal 120hp over 24 seconds? &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
I said reduce the duration to 24 seconds, not the amount healed.  Don't be obtuse.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Uh... this is more efficient than the level 57 cleric group heal &quot;Word of Restoration&quot; ... thats a bit overpowering&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
It doesn't compare to Group CH...though I'd be thrilled with a Healing Wave of Prexus caliber group heal.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Larger heal such as? Would you like complete heal so you can try to usurp cleric jobs? Natures touch is balanced with divine light.. i can see dropping the mana cost by 50 to equal it out &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
We don't want Complete Heal, quit attempting to insinuate that we do.<br>
<br>
As for a larger heal, there are all sorts of ideas for how large it should be.  I'll let Verant bang their heads on that one.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You're kidding right? 1950 over 50 seconds.. would be the second most powerful dot after Funeral Pyre... if you want 1950 dmg.. it should be at 1.5 mins (like Pox of Bertoxulous or Pyrocuror) otherwise.. if you want a 50 second dot.. be looking at 1400. &lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The figure was based off our level 53 DoT, Winged Death, which its intended to be an upgrade to.  Winged Death does 1250ish over 54 seconds as I recall off the top of my head.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Your Nukes are fine... you out nuke magicians&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A) The request was that Verant would fix Moonfire, which until the recent changes (Made after this petition was completed) had a worse ratio and slower cast time than our next lower Cold based nuke.  That's what we call a broken useless spell.  Verant fixed it, however.  And no, we don't outnuke Magicians.   <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;What about shamans? In the petition you guys didn't even care to include them... just ME, ME, ME, I, I, I. OH..and what about Paladins, Shamans, and Rangers as well? Paladins are just a small version of a cleric...Shouldn't they have better healing? If you want to change druids you have to go the whole nine yards..THINK about this stuff before you become selfish and self-involved.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
The name of the post is State of the Druid.  Not State of the Hybrids, Druids, Shamans, and my dog Corey.<br>
<br>
I've never seen a single other class ask Verant to give druids a boost in our abilities when outlining how they think Verant should fix them.<br>
<br>
You're sounding like a fool. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>
