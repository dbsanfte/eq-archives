I am not 50 yet.  However, I do know a couple of things.  <br>
1.  The more you swing, the greater the chances of you hitting.  Which increases your chances of doing damage towards a mob.  <br>
More swings = More chances to hit = Greater potential to deliver damge<br>
<br>
2.  Evaluate the damage and delay of the weapon you are using.  I have a 23/40 2 hander and a Mith 2 hander 21/40 30% haste.  Now if i took the first weapon and placed on an FBSS i still dont perform as well as my Mith.  Even use Luthair's Damage Calc and it shows higher DPM for the Mith.  But this is just one example.<br>
<br>
3.  Balance yourself.  Do your best to have haste / ac / hp.  You can even consider resists and wis/mana, but more often than not you will have sets for these you switch to as need facilitates.  Having lots of haste but no hp or low ac items the higher level you are the more trouble you will be in because you will get hit more and cannot take damage as long as someone else.  Yes you may hit more during the short time you can stand there, but the longer you are attacking the mob also gives you more potential to do damage towards it was well.  Balance these factors.<br>
<br>
4.  For the original question Haste &gt; all then why dont some 50+ have it?  Any number of reasons.  Perhaps they are saving up to buy a nice uber haste instead of a lower haste item.  Maybe they are holding out to get a good haste drop and saving plat to upgrade other gear at the same time.  Maybe they arent guilded, play off peak hours and solo alot, and are poor and can't afford 3k for FBSS or dont even know how to do the Swift Claw Sash quest or tried 25 times and never got it and gave up.  Face it, some people take time to reasearch thier class, the game mechanics, and go for thie gear to optimize thier toon.  Other people don't do this for various reasons and just play the game.  I can think of plenty of reasons why they wouldnt have haste.  <br>
<br>
5.  Have fun.  <br>

30% haste will make the mith far outperform 21% haste with the other weapon...<br>
<br>
I'm trying to educate the masses.<br>
I realize there's a million reasons or excuses or whatever for not having haste.<br>
And you can play however you want. But if you don't have haste. I am suggesting that you are doing significantly less damage than you should be, I am suggesting that you are being blinded by the visible ac numbers you see and are not taking into account correctly the unfortunately invisible number(haste) which in fact has the most significant effect on performance.<br>
<br>
You can use whatever you want in game. <br>
Verant really should put the haste values directly on the items. If they can show a number like the damage bonus on a weapon, why can't they show haste? It'd save alot of headaches and arguments and I bet if people actually had a number they could look at they'd use haste more.<br>
<br>
Angelsyn your arguments have nothing to do with anything really. You are just talking about maximizing your efficiency by taking into account which will be better. combinations of weapon and haste are irrelevant to the discussion anyway.<br>
We both agree that the hasted weapon is far better off than the unhasted one. You are just arguing about what ya can afford to maximize em.<br>
It's not like afterwards if you could afford a higher haste item you wouldn't get that as well to further increase your performance..... <br>
<br>
Regardless of what ratio weapon you are using, the final product from unhasted to unhasted is always the same  percentage better. My point is that the percent gained from being hasted is far superior to any absolute gain you get from ac. Gains in ac do not scale like haste does as ac is a straight number and haste is a percentage.<br>
<br>
Mobs dying faster is much preferred to mitigating more damage and the mobs dying slower. The end result is a huge savings in hp due to the mob not swinging when it's dead. heh. And that damage mitigated is far more than any ac boost can possibly give you. Period.<br>
<br>
This doesn't make any sense:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes you may hit more during the short time you can stand there, but the longer you are attacking the mob also gives you more potential to do damage towards it was well. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Last time I checked a mob had a set number of hit points. How can you do MORE damage to it? Once it's dead and you took 5k hp off it or whatever. If it took you 1 minute or 2 minutes you still only did 5k of damage.<br>
I guess the less damage you are doing and longer you are fighting the more it will regen so you have more hp to shave off it to kill it. lol. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you are 50+ and making excuses or don't want to use a haste item that's fine. But don't expect to perform as well as you should. And when you can't solo places others can with ease, you'll know why.<br>

What I meant about the longer you can stand up to a mob and attack giving you the potential to do more damage is this:<br>
If i had high haste, but low ac / hp, while im attacking mob, it is also attacking me.  If I cant take the damage long enough to kill the mob, the mob wins I lose.  I never stated you do more damage than the mobs hp I clearly meant that you should balance your toon.  Even if you are hasted very well, the longer you can take damage from the mob means the more damage you do to it.  Example: say your hasted DPM is 400 and all your damage goes thru.  The mobs hp is 1200.  You are standing toe to toe, no procs, nukes, dots just by pure DPM it would take you 3 min to kill the mob.  Say your hp is 800 and the mob does 300 dpm and all its damage go thru, you most likey would be dead by before the mob.  This is just an extremely basic situation, but if you were to get extremely technical you could prove the same thing, you must do as much damage as you can to the mob before the mob kills you.  The more hp you have , the longer you can stand there attacking the mob.  The more ac you have, the more you can avoid damage.  The more haste you have, the more you swing, the more chances you get to do more damage towards the mob.    <br>
1) Yes get haste<br>
2) Have a decent weapon to use with your haste.<br>
3) make sure you have decent AC<br>
4) make sure you have decent HP<br>
5)Dependant upon your situation, make sure u have the correct resists at a decent amount.<br>
6) And finally, <br>
I hope this is a little clearer now.  I never meant to imply anything else.   <br>

<br>
Yes but the point is, there is no one item that I know of with enough hit points or AC to make a 20% difference in the amount of hp or AC you have.  1 low end haste item makes a 20% difference in the amount of damage you do. <br>
<br>
The reason haste>all IMO is that all other stats grant you incremental improvements... a few hp there, a bit more AC there. In EQ terms, a 20% change in anything is massive.  Haste is the one place you can really get that kind of massive change.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, all other things being equal, if the mob dies faster you can kill more per hour....  <p><font size="+1">

Here are the facts:<br>
<br>
21% haste item = 21% increase in DAMAGE, NOT a 21% decrease in delay. So a 21% haste item increases damage for every weapon 21%, regardless of dam/delay/ratio<br>
<br>
The delay cap is 9, but it does not apply to haste. It simply means you will not find any weapons with a base delay of under 9.<br>
<br>
I found this statement amusing -<br>
<br>

<br>
I can't remember the last time I took a cleric to HS. The majority of the mobs die in like 30~ seconds, and do very little damage. Druid heals are more then sufficient since our damage output makes a cleric pretty much useless.<br>
<br>
To anyone that says haste is useless for solo'ing, you better stop casting VoM. That's 300 mana you could be using for heals for less downtime!...<br>
<br>
If you didn't see the sarcasm in that last statement i'll explain it for you...<br>
<br>
If you can solo 8 mobs on a bar of mana w/o VoM, then cast VoM and can still only solo 8 mobs since you lose 300 mana, then whats the point?.... Oh way, you're killing those 8 mobs 25% faster, hence getting the same exp in a shorter time frame. If you cannot see this then I really can't help you anymore.<br>
<br>
Damage is ALMOST as important as healing. A Tormax raid with 4 clerics and 50 people has a much better chance of winning then the same raid with 8 clerics and 30 people.<br>
<br>
I'll leave this post with one more point. You can only use ONE haste Item. If you could only use ONE wisdom item, would you use one with 40 wis, or one with 20 wis and 40 ac? Afterall, doesn't the Ac make up for the 20 lost wis even though you can find more AC elsewhere on another slot while your wis is now capped at 20 instead of 40? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28774>Fogel Xanedu(My Profile)</a><BR><a href=http://www.Thunderwalkers.net>Thunderwalkers</a><BR>Level 60 Paladin<BR>Morell-Thule<BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

<br>
Haste like I pointed out earlier does not reduce delay. Haste items are listed as percentage increases in damage. Fbss increases all weapons damage by 21%. It does NOT reduce your delay by 21%<br>
<br>
2hs Damage bonus is static and scales up based on the delay of the weapon. The 40+ delay bonus was removed long ago.<br>
1hs damage bonus is static across the board based on level.<br>

Kind of curious how you'd know that, no way we could actually prove it.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure 40+ bonus is still there on 1h Fogel.<br>

I'm lvl 56, the haste I had before I got my Silver girdle of stability was silvery belt of contention, I believe same haste as FBSS + 10 ac and stats.<br>
<br>
We kill the Keeper, belt drops, hmmm, 10 ac w/haste or 25 ac and not have haste and just use VoM until I can get back haste.<br>
<br>
I'll take the added raw 25 ac thanks.<br>
<br>
So, for a couple weeks I had no haste (like omg)  Now I have a CoF.  Much better haste for just a bit of patience.<br>
<br>
To me ac is more important since I really screwed my stats up when I started.  To each their own though. <p><CENTER><FONT COLOR=#000080><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125072">~Qaldaena Starrdancer~</A></FONT><BR><FONT COLOR=2E8B57>Knight of Tunare</FONT><BR>

Just because you can say it doesn't mean it applies.<br>
<br>
Fact is, I have proven haste is better then ANYTHING you can put in the slot to replace it. There is no evidence to say otherwise. People, don't trust your &quot;gut feelings&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh, and the &quot;I got like no stats, so I really suck&quot; arguement isn't a good one since the vast majority of stats are very arbitrary, especially in small increments. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28774>Fogel Xanedu(My Profile)</a><BR><a href=http://www.Thunderwalkers.net>Thunderwalkers</a><BR>Level 60 Paladin<BR>Morell-Thule<BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

As a paladin your dmg output is low (hasted or not) say for example you are partnered with a rogue its just the two of ya, that  rogue will be dealing 75% of the dmg to your 25% of the damage (if yer damage is even that much) so if you inc your 25% of the dmg by 20% (hasted) yall be killing it all of about 5% faster, now if you instead had an inc in AC to make you take as the above example all the way back at the begining of 9%less dmg  that 9% would come from the total dmg the mob deals (hopefully yer doing your job and keeping the mobs full attention) which as you can see would decrease downtime.  Now add in a couple more people (if there melee trust me unless there other paladins they will be doign more then you) and assume your 25% of the dmg now is like 5% of the dmg add your 20%haste to that 5% and wooh yer killing it what 2%faster where as with the ac yer still avoiding 9% of the total dmg of the mob (assumeing your still holding agro).  For all you who say but that wont help soloing remember this is eq if yer over level 50 yer probably not soloing anything sept the occasional green <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uangelsyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Angelsyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/tdlutenatenjou/icon_keyne.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed Protector</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/7/02 5:30:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/tdlutenatenjou/icon_keyne.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HASTE &gt; ALL. why do some 50+ not have any?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2hs Damage bonus is static and scales up based on the delay of the weapon.
