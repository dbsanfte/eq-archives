&quot;It was simply there to prevent the establishment of a national religion.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first amendment does not refer to the establishment of a single religion.  It states the following:<br>
&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;&quot;<br>
<br>
It states &quot;establishment of religion.&quot;  Not establishment of A religion... so saying it is there to prevent an established national religion is simply false. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8420<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/29/02 4:28:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=362>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/portraits/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Zifnab: you did not answer the question at all why you distinguish between thought and action in terms of justifying why that distinction is relevant to being unamerican.

You misunderstood the word emotional as well - it wasn't about anger. See the second phrase: not rationally.<br>

If someone argues that OJ didn't commit murder because they think he's so nice, that's emotional not rational.<br>

Zifnab, you are invited to try to justify the use of thought versus action to call someone unamerican here.<br>

Borofin, you are invited to respond to the number of issues you haven't.<br>
<br>
And as for McCarthy being a red herring - first, at least it's relevant to the reasons why the language was added in 1954; and second, it's probably been mentioned about the same number of times as the aguments like &quot;a majority want this, so it must be right&quot;.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen anyone say this is wrong simply because it was passed in the McCarthy era, it's just a factor in analyzing. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/sig/jaharad.gif" border="0">

<br>
First of all, the Jewish faith and the Christian faith are two seperate religions that are worlds apart. They shouldn't be lumped together unless you include the Moslem faith as they all come from the same common beginings, but are all worlds apart. Personally, I'd further divide Christianity to Catholocism and Prodestantism as I've attended both types of services and studied both, and they really don't seem like the same religion to me either, although they share common names for alot of things, but you're milage may very. I personally don't see the God in "under God" as being any specific diety, but one that could represent any faith. It should be neither here nor there what it says as it is not a law, and therefore can't be unconstitutional. It's a pledge...one that has been adopted by the government, but not a law. A teacher saying it no more endorses God (whichever one you see the word being representative of) as the official government diety, or religion, then the president drinking a coke on national television makes Coke the national drink over Pepsi. It's a choice...yes it's the choice of an authority figure, but it is completely impractical for an authority figure such as a teacher to remove any hint of brand name or value from themselves. If a teacher is black, does that endorse black teachers over white teachers or mean that the school endorses people of color by hiring a black teacher for the position? If the Supreme Court Justice drives a Mercedes, does that mean that it's the official car? Is the President saying the official government stance is that hetrosexuality is the way things are because he's not gay? Hogwash.<br>
<br>
Second of all, several comments were made about military chapels and chaplins. The military endorses no single religion. There are also military mosques and temples (something I'm sure the former/current military posters here can attest to), and in fact there is also a Temple at the Naval Academy. There are rabbi's and mullahs. There are sweat lodges on at least 2 army bases I've personally been to as well as weekly wiccan gatherings on two cruises I was on on both the USS John F Kennedy and the Roosevelt. Therefore, there's nothing wrong with military chapels or chaplins and because they serve the needs of the members of the service as do the other representatives of other religions. They aren't endorsed by the government, but permitted, which is what freedom of religion is all about. You can, in fact, put just about any religion down you want on the form when you sign up for service and even have it on your dogtag (mine had Hedonist for religion actually). It's been alot of years, but there were something like 50 or 60 recognized religions (they have some sort of criteria for becoming recognised having to do with number of followers etc. I'm sure it costs 50 Million to study a given religion and there's some sort of matrix that has to mesh...hehe). The Wiccan religion became recognised as an official religion when I was in the service. As a recognised religion, the military has to provide a place for you to worship as well as someone to oversee it if it's necessary, such as a chaplin, a priest or whatever. Most chaplins, in fact, do multidenominational services, at least in the navy.<br>
<br>
Lastly...Marriage. Anybody who tells you that marriage is a religious or social institution never met my ex wife's lawyer. The fact is, no matter who performs the ceremony, it's very much a legal merger of two people's assets and responsibilities. If anyone would like to dispute this, i'd be happy to send you the outstanding balance of either my lawyer or my curren't wife's lawyer from our divorces...Maybe you can convince them that it was only a social institution. I'll give you the judge's number too...I'd really like some of the money he said my ex wife could keep...hehe.<br>

<br>
Jensor...I'd suggest that you put on a uniform, stand a post, and take some enemy fire some time. You might realize at that point just how wrong that statement is. There are plenty of atheists in the military, even in combat (although I never personally met one that didn't yell out to God or Jesus from time to time at appropriate moments when things were going boom), but you'd be surprised how many of them will confide in a chaplin after being in the @#%$, regardless of their lack of faith. <br>
<br>
Believe me...the only thing the military is pushing is the military. There is NO religious agenda whatsoever and if it weren't for the fact that morale would drop through the floor, not to mention discipline, the chaplins would be gone in a heartbeat. The military want's machines, not people of faith. It's the members of the military that want the chaplins.<br>

<br>
Jensor, the chapel on a military base, or a chaplain in a prison, are different issues that need to be looked at in their own right. Those involve people who do not have freedom of movement to practice religion, and the availability of those resources may be an appropriate government activity, to protect their ability to practice religion, if the public sees fit to vote the funds for it. Having a chaplain available is different than forcing a child to listen to the teacher say something religious.<br>
<br>
I could listen to arguments but I'm not opposed to those activities at the moment.<br>
<br>
However I suspect you have to treat each religion equally if you do have those resources.<br>
<br>
Second, consider this example when talking about how the pledge is non-demonational.<br>
<br>
Imagine the protestant majority wants to put in language to make it fit protetestants but not Catholics. Is that ok?<br>
<br>
You say &quot;oh no, we don't want to be that exclusionary&quot;.<br>
<br>
How in principle is it any different for a protestant majority to exclude a catholic minority, than to exclude atheists? <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/sig/jaharad.gif" border="0">

I think as long as the government is funding this church, it qualifies as unconstitutional.  Plus, where are the mosques on this base?  Where are the Buddhist temples?  Where are the synagogues?<br>

Because it's discriminatory for one religion? As I understand all are welcome to use and they try to treat all equally. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~craig234/eq/sig/jaharad.gif" border="0">

Chaplains in the military service are not &quot;Christain only&quot; representatives of religion. Chaplains serve a wide variety of religions and even serve non-religious roles as counsellors. Removing chaplains from military bases would undermine freedom of religion because it would remove access to spiritual consultation from soldiers. Yes, the government pays for them, but it pays for them regardless of the religion of various soldiers. As noted by someone already, the chaplains even hold wiccan ceremonies, as much as government money going to that pisses off some people.<br>
<br>
But, when it comes to &quot;Under God&quot; and &quot;In God We Trust&quot; its specific recognition of the Judeo-Christian god, not just spirituality in general. We know that becuase of the spelling of the word and because of the statements by congress and Eisenhower at the time the law was passed. They made no mention of &quot;spirituality&quot;, they made specific mention of pushing Christianity into the schools. IMO, anyone still trying to push the &quot;its not the Judeo-Christian god, its god in general!&quot; is ignoring all the evidence to the contrary purposefully.<br>
<br>
Also, congress passing that bill to affirm the 1954 law, to me, is just one big farce. As Pet said, a free way to affirm some votes in the mid-term elections. These people aren't making a logical decision based on case law and a careful study of the constitution, they came out right away with no discussion ... praying and speaking the pledge ... it was an emotional reaction based on an emotional decision ... a shame that these supposedly educated men could act with such a pathetic knee-jerk reaction. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujensorthetonedeaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jensor the Tonedeaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/30/02 12:02:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17260.topic&index=373>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pledge of Allegiance declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Sorry... from the way Zifnab put it, I thought they were Christian churches.

I am a christian, but I feel it is wrong when chaplains hold a christian prayer before ceremonies.  The miltary goes to great lengths to include all religions, and make things easier for those that practice.  They even allow native americans to smoke peyote for their religious ceremonies.  So, why is every change of command, retirement, or what have you ceremony in the military begin with a christian prayer?  I am sure the muslims or hindus do not like it.  Me, being a christian myself don't like at all.  If not for that reason, then just the fact that the prayer is always pre-written and has no meaning or sincerity to it anyway, which offends me maybe even more than people of other religions.  Really, i think it is impossible to make everyone happy anyways, there will always be something someone does not like.<br>
