Individually</span><hr size=1>      I was thinking that, since VI shot down our last petition that we should set up some basis for and another petition that could be easily duplicated and emailed separately to VI.  Some things that I think might help, would be putting your login name with characters that you have created.  I was thinking that our debate on balancing issues with the druid class would be more solid if for instances. <br>
     Each person posting a petition had played a certain amount of classes past a certain level. Say 3 different classes past level 30 to 40's, or possibly multiple high level classes, since we are wanting to change the high end game for druids.  I see this as a better solution that would be more valuable to VI.  I know this would be more difficult to put together but I think we have a lot of good ideas that could be revised and sent out by qualified people.<br>
     What I was thinking was to have some sort of outline which could easily guide each individual to compare and contrast within each class that they have played at the high end game.  Even if we had 20% of the respondents of the previous post, this would be a more viable way to get our point across to VI.  <br>
     Wondering if there is any support out there to help get this put together.  Remember persistence pays off in the end..<br>

Caster balancing is in the works, so lets just wait and see what that does to us so we can then decide whether the Druid community has been treated fairly or whether its numbers will dwindle again, which in my opinion will not be too bad a thing.<br>
I'm tired of being compared to Pet druids who are phat-lewt hungry and who do nothing but give us real druids bad names.<br>

Individually</span><hr size=1> I agree with Araxx, but then I also think my definition of 'uber' doesn't quite match the definition attached to it by the masses.<br>
<br>
I think .. the druid class is .. perfect. Sunbeem's life as a druid has been wonderful (and if I do say so .. she is utterly adorable, and as powerful as she chooses to be .. even if she is always a bit wisdom challenged). I have loved her (and her skills in druidry) since the day she (and all her clones) were born. I have never ever felt I lacked anything at all to be honest. <br>
<br>
I know people who are in those high level raid catagories .. will differ with me on this (and I feel sure that, given what YOU want to do in that rarefied air place, you have some legitimate issues .. but .. the versatility of the druid is always what has made me glad I was born of that class .. and it continues to delight me to this day - over 3 years since I began dipping my delicate toes into this world we know as Norrath. <br>
<br>
As I heard someone say just recently .. the only thing Verant did not anticipate when they brought Norrath to life .. was the players LOL. The players are out of their control, folks. But .. they have to deal with us all .. and .. though I too have had moments along the way when I did not feel &quot;I&quot; was 'the' most important thing in VIs world (and .. on a bad day .. add to that .. the fact that I have, in passing, thought I SHOULD be .. LOL) .. I think they have done (and continue to do) an amazing job. <br>
<br>
I remember a world, way back when, when we didn't even know about Norrath .. and it may not even have existed! In that world .. I was not good at running fast, I could not leap into the air and levitate, I could not just wish myself on the other side of the continent, and I certainly couldn't fight off many of life's foes with the dexterity I now can. My attempts at healing others .. were limited to bandages and hugs for bruised knees, and Kleenex for snotty, bleeding noses. Now .. I am POWERFUL and IN CONTROL. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am thankful for the moments and the means to experience those feelings .. even if it is only 'fantasy'.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Hobbit of Love</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/24/02 2:01:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27415.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creation of a new type of petition?

Hmmm...the Dark Side I sense in you, yesss.  Brainwashed by VAKs you are.  Unaware, are you, of the limitations of the Druid Force.  <br>
<br>
No farming druids have there been past level 30 for a long time.  No.  Only port box Druids do I see an abundance of.  <br>
<br>
Hunted down by Darth Verant have the real druids been.  Into monks and warriors and shaman have they changed.  <br>
<br>
Better is it to be mediocre at many skills, or the master of fewer skills?  Think on that, padewan, and realize, you will, that the Druids have long since seen their days of power. Hmmmm.<br>

<br>
I say wait and see what happens and go from there.  While some of the petition was definately fat, there were a couple good points in it so hopefully Sony pulls those good ideas out and runs with them.<br>
<br>
As I have said over and over again, Sony probably already has a plan for druids (petition or no petition) and it will come down to whether there plan is agreeable to much of the high end druids around here.  If so, great... if not, maybe we see an exodus either out of the game or to other classes.  <br>
<br>
Either way, I am not convinced druids (or any class) has as much control or power over the game as many want to believe.  History has shown that hardly anyone actually leaves the game... they just threaten and threaten.  Until those theats become reality, ultimate power remains with Sony. <p><table border="0">

Our petition was <b>not</b> shot down; it accomplished what it was meant to do.<br>
<br>
Not only did we get ourselves heard, but Alan also released a statement about petitions in general, which happened after our petition (among others), and GU Comics made at least two comics regarding us, our current state, and petitions. VI reads GU Comics too, you know. Don't you think Woody has given us a lot of ink time recently? If you don't think so, go check the GU Comics archives!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, on the issue of petitions, if you read what Alan preferred (he was actually trying to help), then I hope you sent in <b>your individual bullet list</b> -- I know I have for myself, and Sobe did on behalf of The Druids Grove.<br>

Hello, what universe do you live in?  The farmers on my server are most certainly not druids (ie, a druid is their main).  The poorest chars I know are druids.  The ones with all the cash, from &quot;farming&quot;, are melees (WAR/MNK/ROG), clerics, chanters, and wizzies.<br>
<br>
It's true druids have a harder time getting groups.  So they tend to solo more.  Solo where?  Mostly outdoors.  Oh yeah, lots of good loot there ;P<br>
<br>
The chars who get good groups together more often, go to interesting places to XP, and they get the good loot.  They win a roll, and if they can't use it or twink it, they sell it.  That is the &quot;farming&quot; of present day EQ.<br>

<br>
You see, that's where you're wrong. Having more tools at your disposal makes you think less. When you have to rack your brain around a problem it gets you on your toes and makes you a better player. The less tools you got, the more skills AS A PLAYER you gain. You totally missed my point.<br>
That is why there are so many bad druids out there. I absolutely HATE having a druid in my group when playing my alts. Why? Because they know Jack $hit about what being a Druid is all about. All they do is nuke too early, don't regen, forget about thorns, forget to snare, etc... Why does this happen? Because, as we all know, and I quote 'Druids are easy to play, but it is not easy to play a Druid well'. So you see, when 75% of the Druid population out there are the 'farming I'm so uber type druid' who don't know how to play, it doesn't help the rest of us at all. All those extra skills you mentioned just make it easier to do the same thing, they don't make you a better player.<br>
Personally I would like to see these people get out of our class and go back to where they came from.<br>
Oh, and Tatankawd, people create Druid alts to farm. Don't be misled. Go into any mid level dungeon and do a /who. Then ask those in /roleplay what class they are. Druids are everywhere. I can go into ANY mid level dungeon and farm what I like if I wanted to, and you should know it.<br>
<br>
This is not an attack (As you can see I don't 'Duh' people or ask them 'What universe do you live in?') but a very serious point. Tell me you are 100% happy with all the druids you come across and I'll gladly reconsider my posture. But I've seen things from your point of view and I know what I'm talking about. It is sad, but it is true.<br>

<br>
i always have to wonder one thing....<br>
<br>
why is there the automatic assumption that just because one farms, one cant really play their class? =)<br>
<br>
i suppose i fit the definition of &quot;farmer drooid&quot; quite well.  im a solo player, i prefer to solo and hunt alone (classic anti-social druid type personality), i genuinely enjoy playing in lower level zones and wandering around killing things and collecting little goodies for my twinkage pile.  i really like farming things for my tradeskills and quests, dont mind sitting around for hours on end killin little things or waiting on other things to spawn.<br>
<br>
and this solo life ive undertaken for most of my druidic career taught me how to be a better druid.  i learned the layout of dungeons, agro control, pathing and agro, game mechanics, all by playing by myself, all by RELYING on myself.  a solo druid has no cleric to heal them or tank to taunt off them, has no monk to solo pull for them or wizard to power nuke.  a solo druid does it all on their own.<br>
<br>
so lets just drop this &quot;i'm a real druid and they're just a twink/farmer&quot; holier-than-thou attitude.  its way too reminiscent of the nasty attitudes so many old rogues had/have against any &quot;new&quot; rogues/twinks/druids.  we are all just people playing characters, regardless of how we play or how WELL we play, and regardless of what class button we happen to have clicked first. <p>-K<br>

Just one question: How do your solo abilities make you a better group player? The memmed spell layout is TOTALLY different. I'm not showing a 'holier-than-thou' attitude, I'm addressing an issue, and if you felt included in my description about people creating Druid Alts to farm dungeons, well, just ask yourself whether you're one of them.<br>
I'm sick of getting $hit because there are so many bad players around due to the nature of a Druid's skill allowing for this. Do NOT get the issues mixed up.<br>
I'm a very humble player, I'm not trying to teach anyone anything they shouldn't already know, just shedding light on an old subject from a different perspective. Discuss the issue with valid arguments, don't attack me for showing you it.<br>
<br>

There would be no difference to them with one single petition or 4,000 seperately mailed/dev board submitted obvious form letter type petitions.<br>
<br>
Seeing and noting the existence of a petition, or even reading it, does not mean they are going to be any more apt to change anything.<br>
<br>
I think the druid is a great class also, I love it and I love my epic. If you want to be the best uber group needed class, then you should not be a druid. They(classes like warrior, etc) bought their position in the higher end or group game via sucking for a long time and being LFG for nine hours while we enjoyed doing whatever the heck we pleased, very easily, at level 14 plus (just using that as an example because that is sow plus our first real DOT) <br>
<br>
It is called balance. Any time you have a class in Everquest which solos WELL, giving it anymore advantages for grouping makes it solo even BETTER. In the end you have a master class which is way out of balance with the rest of them. A warrior was a good tank at level 20 and is a great tank at level 60 but in both cases its a very sucky tank out on its own without a cleric. <br>
<br>
I try to think of ways they could improve the druid class<br>
for grouping while not making us even MORE powerful while<br>
soloing OR making us TOO desireable for grouping, but they are kind of hard to think up. That might be a good direction to go in though when submitting requests to verant. One that is often mentioned is Group Healing for AOE type situations. Problem then is, Paladins have kind of found a niche in AOE groups due to being able to Group Heal while filling other rolls and a druid getting that would step on the toes of the paladin who is NOT as welcome in other regular groups and who CAN'T really solo its way out of a paper bag. Once again, you get balance problems.<br>
<br>
A swiss army knife will not be the best tool for the job, but its the best tool if you often want to do MANY jobs while only having ONE tool. That is about the best summary of all the things a druid can do that I can think of. Like the swiss army knife, this is going to come at a price and you may one day wish you had a real seperate saw, spoon or corkscrew. You must also remember that like the swiss army knife, you enjoyed the versitality for quite a long time before you came to a point where you wished you had a more specialized tool.<br>
<br>
I think we should all send verant our individual opinions via the developer's corner, I often do. <p><center><BR>

You can be great player with tons of dedication but if your not really having fun others will start to avoid you. Then you lose the one thing that could help you through a difficult time - friends who don't really care if your class is weak currently but get tired if your allways a drag to be around. Getting too deep into whine mode ruins the game for yourself and lessens enjoyment for others and should be avoided. <br>
<br>
The Grove is currently a lot like PoN (Paladins of Norrath) before SoL and melee / 2h upgrades. That board was infested with negative posts that still crop up from time to time even though paladins as a whole are doing very well these days. The after effects of all that negativity still lessens the enjoyment some paladins have with the game this many months latter. Hopefully druids will get some decent upgrades and can get out of this phase without dragging a ton of baggage into the future.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxitix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xitix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/26/02 7:17:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/26/02 11:42:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27415.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Creation of a new type of petition?

<br>
We've heard this argument before. And the fact is, most of us have tried or are playing other classes in addition to druids. And you think VI is getting off the hook so easily?<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>You can be great player with tons of dedication but if your not really having fun others will start to avoid you.

<br>
The most bitter and crusty druids left the class long ago and aren't here. Maybe they lurk. /shrug  The discussions and debates are frequent because of the very fact that we KNOW VI is reading the boards almost daily and that caster balancing has been on the table for months. <br>
<br>
And who said we weren't having fun? Just because they come and post here doesn't mean they're not having fun with their guilds and friends.

<br>
So to my point.  If you have a suggestion, type a /feedback responce.  Keep it reasonable in language and describe what your thinking.  Write down what you want to say first.  At fan faire, the dev team stressed they read the feedback.  <br>
<br>
I think that is the most important method to change the druid class so that it is more needed and respected at raid.<br>
<br>
Again, the issue druids have is raiding at lv 60+.  It does not pretain to grouping or soloing.  After all, getting a better heal does not help solo really.  Getting a better heal probably wont help pl another charater much.  It could help in situations where a fast heal is needed or some special spell or spell line. <p><CENTER>
