A near epic weapon that is (in appearance) significantly easier / less time consuming to acquire, but only a subset of paladins can get it.  Thus, I would've liked to hear that now that subset no longer has the 'easy out'.<br>
<br>
Upon thinking about it further, it helps the paladin /community/ for them to have this alternate.  We all agree there has been a bottleneck with the books.  (Ignoring any possible Luclin epic upgrades) The ND lessened that bottleneck, because now there are fewer people trying to get the books - most Tunarian HIE and HEF will be seeking the ND, and thus will pass on the Torn and Frost books.  Thus, giving a subset of paladins an alternate _helped_the_rest_of_us_, not hurt us or cheapened the achievement of an FD.<br>
<br>
While I think going sololy on 3rd hand knowledge from 'some gm' is not cause for alarm (sorry if the original poster has a lot of weight around here - I'm relatively new, and thus they don't have much weight with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  VI might make future epic steps, might not.  If they do extend the epics, I hope they give Tunarian paladins an alternative as well, be it requiring the ND or be another quest altogether.<br>
<br>
We are paladins.  We should not be delighting in the pain of our own.<br>

<br>
Epic's were the largest screwup by verant to date in quests. The balance issues with some are huge, the difficultly with them is totally wide ranging, it took them a LONG time to develop the particle effects for them and they have said they always want droped items to be better then quested items. Unless the upgrade comes in some form of UberDrop00 + old epic = new sword then I'd seriously doubt on them editing them.<br>

Personally, I don't care who got what. Am I a little irked that only a certain number of people who were lucky enough to get an alternative that is 10x or more easy that's almost as good? Maybe, a little.<br>
<br>
But you know what? I've never heard anyone who's done the ND quest have the balls to say they worked as hard to get their sword as those of us who went out and got our epics.<br>
<br>
Personally ... I've never seen any disrespect among the paladins on my server as to who has what. But you know what? I have a friend who has ND and FD, and he put it best. &quot;Yeah, I got ND a long time ago. Took me 5 hours from start to finish. It's a great weapon. Though when I finished my Fiery Defender after 2 years of hard work, fustration, and dedication ... I carried my head a bit higher and my shoulders back more on the days after that.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because something is an easy quest doesn't mean that we don't work as hard.&quot;<br>
<br>
It makes absolutely no logical sense what-so-ever.<br>
<br>
Nature's Defender isn't &quot;anothe epic&quot;, by far - even compared to the Ragebringer quest. It'd be like a fucking rogue saying he worked just as hard as a mage to get his epic pet.<br>
<br>
Needing to be 55 doesn't make the quest itself &quot;harder&quot;. Infact, unless you're in an uber guild, and you're not a tunare paladin, you need to get those books before your 53. More restrictive imo.<br>
<br>
So, as a paladin, I do feel sympathy for you. You don't have that alternative that's &quot;almost as good for 1/10 the work&quot; anymore. And, as a paladin, I'd say suck it up, we're all in the same boat now so who cares?<br>

I also founded most of the quest myself, posted on this board and complained on how easy it was only to get flamed (ahh the memories). Then they made the quest a tad more difficult, yet still extremely easier compared to our epic. For me, ND was kinda hard since I had to figure most of the quest out (yeah, it really wasnt that hard to figure out, but was harder than to read some spoiler on it).<br>
<br>
I find it very humorous that other Tunare following Paladins who got their Nature's Defender are complaing now that they might have to do the Fiery Defender quest. A good way to ease your fear and frustration about doing the FD quest is to think of the ND quest as a sword that you got for practically nothing almost till you could finish up FD.<br>
<br>
Go out, do your epics. Im extremely surprised a lot of you with NDs didnt go ahead and do the epic anyway for the meaning or the symbol of just getting it done. All the servers now are at least 6 months old, with some dating as old as the Fiery Avenger quest itself. Most guilds have spare books laying around now and for the right amount of plat you could buy yourself a set. (Ive seen this happen on Prexus, and we arent one of the eldest servers)<br>
<br>
Wait and see what happens in Luclin. If you need a FA, go out and do the quest and stop complaining about it. If it really matters that much to you to get this new weapon, you will go out and do the quest to attain it<br>

<br>
Lots of paladins didnt go out and &quot;just do it&quot; because there were still other paladins in the guild or friends of the guild who would have also like a chance to complete their epics. And please remember that on some servers you dont simply decide one day your going to take your guild out to kill one of the dragons. You need to get your guild in on the rotation to kill the mobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not the super-duper kindness you're making it out to be when you're giving something away that you think you'll never have a use for. And now that you will likely need it, you wouldn't have been as kind? Just doesn't seem right to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
There was always a use for getting the epic. The epic was better in every way. Im fairly certain that manny Tunare paladins could have taken BOTH swords if they had chosen to. But they sacrificed the better weapon in favor of helping the guild out by getting another guild member their epic instead. You also need to keep in mind that once both books are obtained the whole quest is really something that you can finish up with a group of friends. There is no &quot;busting your ass&quot; involved. <br>
<br>
&quot;But you know what? I've never heard anyone who's done the ND quest have the balls to say they worked as hard to get their sword as those of us who went out and got our epics.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm. Dont you think that the paladins in the guild (and everyone else) worked just as hard to get the epic for the paladin as the paladin did for herself? Most guildmates work just as hard to achive an epic item as the person getting the epic part. So if its difficult for one its difficult for all. And yes i know there are paladins who set up countless naggy/vox raids to get their epic and yes they are the exceptions.<br>

You misread what I said. I said the people who put the time in for the *ND* quest didn't put as much work in as the people who do the epic. Why? Like it's been said, the ND quest is 10x easier. The work isn't there to do =p <p><center>

<br>
Now now Augie, to put it fairly I was unguilded when I got my Epic, and on an AoVB raid to boot. I turned it down twice in the last year so that others could gain theirs, and I buggered the quest up once and had to start over. It wasn't made &quot;easy&quot; by my guild association, since for most of the last year I was in a guild with a mere 10 people. The quest is easy because asside from the bottleneck of books, everything else can be done with one group, two groups if you are lazy and in a very short period of time. The Paladin Epic is easy, there is just a bottleneck that prevents it from turning into the next Monk or Rogue Epic.<br>

You know what though, maybe I will do the FD quest, that way I'll have not only 1, but TWO great swords and I can wave my ND and FD around in the faces of my fellow Paladins and show how great I am cause I did two quests. (not a slam on you Chronnos, you have my respect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I'm sure that will make the lower level Paladins in the alliance feel all warm and fuzzy, especially since they can't use those books that I just used so that I could have a second cool sword.<br>
<br>
The person who said something about not just being able to go and kill the dragons whenever, youy're right.  Karana is a rotation server, we all take turns and when you're up for the dragon, THEN you can kill it, no sooner.<br>
<br>
Some of us aren't able to just run out and do FD because we got ND.  It's considered my epic by my guild, and I consider it my epic.  What do I need two for? <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=31020">

It got nothing to do with the time/effort you put into the quest, but as we all know, some quests continue and some not (can't count the times VI have said this either). <br>
<br>
Did I whine because I never did Soulfire before epic came? Not really, as I could find just as good weapons out there and better, I just had to bite the apple and do the quest from scratch instead without whining since it won't get me anywhere.<br>
<br>
Just do the quest if you find the reward enough for you, since if you would consider it a status symbol you would have gotten FD already <p><font size="1"><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45105">Slitz Jawbreaker</a><br>Crusader of Raging Fury<br>

I dont know how long you have been reading this board but I was the 1st Paladin to receive an ND on any server through the quest. I was also the Paladin that came out and gave the spoiler on how to do the quest the same night I received it (that post might be somewhere here in the general section). In all honesty, back then before primals and ST and North ToV weapons, I used Fiery Defender 100% of the time. Only time I used ND was for show since it looked neat.<br>
<br>
Im not bragging or putting it in anyones face that I had both, that wasnt my intent<br>

<br>
Also while yes I agree that VI stuffed up by giving ND to just one deity (IMO they should have given similar weapons to all deities if they went down that path), I do not think there is any reason to say Tunare Paladin's should pay now for VI stuff-ups.  <br>
<br>
Both arguments are I have found reading through this are very ANTI-PALADIN.  My suggestions?  Firstly wait and see what is the case.  Second, if it does turn out that Tunare Pally's have the bad end of the stick then accept the inevitable like we non-Tunare Pally's that would like a ND but can't.  And if it does turn out OK then all good and well.  Sure it might suck, I and I do congratulate and admire those Paladins who have forfeited their epics to date for others because they can get a ND.  But to then turn that around and use it as an argument that we should get something for that denies the virtue of that act.  Selflessness does not seek to be repayed, if it does then it is just selfishness in disguise.<br>
<br>
Once again, I totally respect those who have sacrificed much, and I hope that some day I will be looked upon as such as well, though I cannot get the ND.<br>

Fine, I didn't have to wait for ages to get books, and I'm sure it sucks for those that did.  I did have to wait til my guild/alliance went to PoH2, on a day that I wasn't working, to get the corruptor, and then make it through 53 and 54.<br>
<br>
We all worked damn hard, we all deserve congrats on our epics.<br>
<br>
If I have to go and do FA/FD for the next upgrade (if there is one), then I will.  All I was saying to start off with, was basically that it kinda sucked.<br>
<br>
So grats to everyone on their Epics, and good luck to every one of you on the next step.<br>

I'm thinking of MQ'ing my Mark of Atonement.  Not only has Talendor or Gorenaire never dropped the books, I've never even fought them (they are always dead before my guild gets on).<br>
