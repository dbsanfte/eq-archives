I had made camp by the ocean for the night, as I couldn’t stand to be away from the deep waters for too long. A small seaweed-fed fire crackled in front of my small tent – oysters were roasting in the coals. I was glad for the solitude – almost no one came by here at night and those who did had no desire to remain for long. The undead risen from the sunken tombs of the Elder High Elves saw to the removal of any who lingered too long. What little magic I knew served to keep the creatures well away from my camp.<br>
<br>
With that security firmly held in my mind, I was startled to look up from the fire and see the soft gleam of a skeleton – staring, empty-eyed, directly at me. With a silent curse for having been so off my guard, I reached for the sword that lay beside me. It wasn’t there. Disconcerted, I rose slowly and prepared to banish the skeleton back to its sandy tomb. I raised my hands… and froze. Just beyond the fire there was a figure, enshrouded in black – I could not make it out except for the gleam of eyes, snapping at me. When he saw I could not move, the figure drew nearer.<br>
<br>
“Greetings, my lady,” he said, bowing before me. “We saw your fire in the night and thought perhaps you might like some company. This is a most dangerous area.” He took a seat near the fire, which cast shadows and shapes across his dark features.<br>
<br>
Although I found that I was unable to speak, my limbs seemed to be functioning again – and I cautiously sat down on the opposite side of the fire from this strange man and his… servant? I still couldn’t see my sword although I looked for it as my eyes wandered over my strange visitors. I had no doubt that what was in front of me was a necromancer. I had seen them before, but always at a distance through the woods of my home – I never dared to go closer.<br>
<br>
“What is your name, dark one?” I asked hesitantly. “I am Taerma, of the temple of Quellious.” He grimaced slightly at the name of my god, although he did smile almost pleasantly on hearing my name.<br>
<br>
“I am Humwawa, and I serve no one but the Walker of the Violet Twilight.”<br>
<br>
We noticed the knife I had by the fire for the oysters at the same time, but he had it in his hand before I could even make a try for it.<br>
<br>
“Oysters,” he smiled. “Do let me open them for you my lady – I would hate to see those hands marred by a cut from their sharp shells.” He caught the first one up out of the fire, deftly pried it open and handed it to me. As I gingerly took it from his hands, I found my voice restored as well.<br>
<br>
“What are you here for, my lord?” I asked, almost too quietly to be heard.<br>
<br>
“Nothing, save your company – I was watching you while you made camp and thought some conversation might pass the time better than my usual nightly activities.” He laughed, and the shadow that hung over me passed away into the sands. “Do not fear me, young paladin. I am not sent here for you. You aren’t eating.” He looked at me expectantly.<br>
<br>
I raised the shell to my lips slowly, never taking my eyes off him. He returned the gaze steadily, and the slightest hint of a smile played across the corners of his mouth as I set the shell back down by the fire.<br>
<br>
“Now my lady, what talk shall we pass the night with? What topic interests a paladin such as yourself?” He grinned, and I could see him laughing at the stiffness with which I responded.<br>
<br>
“No topic interests me but that of honor, my lord.” I grew bolder. “And I would be loathe to have the advantage of you in what should be a pleasant conversation.” I stared directly back at him now, as I was regaining my strength.<br>
<br>
“Ah, honor. Such a noble subject for discourse. Perhaps that would be quite interesting. I think you will find I can hold my own on that theme, my lady.”<br>
<br>
He did – more than adequately. We talked into the night of honor, duty, and of the various and many places where life and death came together in the world. We talked for an eternity, until the sky began to slowly pale. He glanced above him.<br>
<br>
“My lady, I fear I have kept you from your sleep with our conversation. With as many strangers as pass through here in the daylight, it is unsafe for you to sleep alone.” He smiled, gently this time. “Rest, my lady. My servant and I shall guard you while you sleep. There is still so much more to talk about, perhaps when you awake we can discuss such matters further. For now, rest.”<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
When I awoke, I found my sword lying next to my blanket, as if it had never moved at all. I glanced over and saw the fire crackling red in the twilight. And beside it… a dark shadow sat watching me, smiling quietly to see me rise to greet him.<br>
