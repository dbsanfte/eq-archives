<br>
I have two requests before you continue.  First, you read the whole thing before you reply.  If you cannot commit to reading the whole thing, please come back when you can.  It shouldn't take more than five minutes, but sometimes that's enough to throw a monkey wrench in your plans.  Second, post constructive, calm, insightful comments.  Don't tell me, &quot;Zesty, this sucks,&quot; without saying WHY it sucks.  Maybe not everything sucks....maybe its something that can be fixed so that this would work.  <br>
<br>
Whereever I felt that an explanation was necessary, it is in parentheses.  I will endeavor to keep this to a minimum.  The second message in this thread contains what I perceive to be the &quot;pros and cons&quot; of this system.  Thank you for reading.<br>
<br>
<br>
PROPOSED &quot;UBERMOB&quot; ROTATION PROCEDURE<br>
<br>
Rotation lists for mobs with extensively long spawn times on the Brell Serilis server shall be subject to the following rules:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. ROTATION LISTS<br>
<br>
     A -- All rotation lists, regardless of mob spawn time, are limited to 10 spots in size.  Presently, Brell rotates Vox, Nagafen, Venril Sathir, and Trakanon.  With the introduction of the Scars of Velious expansion, more rotated mobs may be discovered.  As these are found, additional rotation lists will be added as necessary.  <br>
<br>
     B -- Initial rotation lists for this procedure shall be taken from the existing open rotation logs of the Brell Serilis message board.  The top ten reservations for each mob shall be retained and all others deleted subject to the new procedure.  (Yes, I know, if you're number 11 on the list, this absolutely sucks.  But I had to start somewhere.  Lists of 12 seemed to me too long, lists of 8 too short, for what I had in mind here.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2. ROTATION LISTS -- WHO CAN BE ON THEM<br>
<br>
     A -- In order to be added to any rotation list, individuals signing up MUST disclose the following: <br>
     Full Character Name<br>
     Character Level<br>
     Guild affiliation, if any.<br>
Failure to disclose this information or deliberately falsifying this information (For example, Joe says he's not in a guild when he is so that he can hold an independent spot on the list.) will result in the individual not being added to the rotation list, or, in the case of any individual who has already been added, the revocation of the reservation in question.<br>
<br>
     B -- All spots in all rotations which are requested by guilded individuals are considered to be held by THAT GUILD, regardless of the intention of the claim.  In the event that the individual who claimed a guild spot in any rotation leaves that guild, either willingly or unwillingly, the spot in the rotation is retained by the guild and the guild's leader becomes the default raid organizer.  In the event that any guild on a rotation list is disbanded, all spots on all rotation lists held by the guild in question are vacated. <br>
<br>
     C -- Any rotation spot held by an unguilded individual is considered to be an INDEPENDENT RAID.  The individual who holds this rotation spot is considered an Independent Raid Organizer (IRO).  At least ONE, but no more than FOUR, spot(s) on each rotation MUST be held by IRO's.  If no IRO signs up for a rotation where no independent raid is presently in line, the 10th spot in that rotation shall be held in abeyance pending the appearance of an IRO to claim the position.  EXCEPTION: If an IRO's raid in any rotation has been conducted, there need be no independent raid in that rotation until sign ups for that particular rotation spot are once again being accepted.<br>
<br>
     D -- No guild may hold spots on more than two rotation lists, or more than one spot on any single rotation list.  No IRO may hold more than one spot on all combined rotation lists.  (This would be increased as more rotation lists are created for Velious, and, subsequently, VP.)  <br>
<br>
     E -- In the event any IRO becomes guilded while he/she holds spots on existing rotation lists, those spots are thereafter held by the individual's new guild assuming this does not violate 2D.  In the event that a previously unguilded IRO becomes a member of a guild and that guild thereafter violates rule 2D, the IRO's raids shall be eliminated by the forum moderator, one at a time, until the guild is once again in compliance with these rules.  (I would consult with the guild in question prior to the elimination of any spots if there was a question as to which to eliminate.)<br>
<br>
     F -- With the exception of rule E, above, all spots on all rotation lists are non-transferable.  If you sign up to run a raid as an IRO, you are the raid organizer.  Not somebody else.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3.  ROTATION LISTS -- CREATION, MAINTENANCE, AND SIGN UP PERIOD<br>
<br>
     A -- The Brell Serilis Raid Forums moderator is responsible for the creation and maintenance of all rotation lists required by these rules.<br>
<br>
     B -- At any time when there are open spots on a given rotation list, the Raid Forums moderator may, at his or her option, open a thread in the sign ups forum of the Brell Board to fill those vacancies.  Spots on a rotation list may ONLY be filled by replying to the moderator's thread.  All spots on these rotations shall be filled on a first-come-first-served basis assuming they are in compliance with all the guidelines in rule 2.  The moderator should NOT attempt to keep all lists full at all times.  Ideally, between 2 and 5 vacancies should exist on a given list before further sign ups are accepted.  This is to prevent individuals and guilds from merely claiming thier vacated spot on a rotation list at the conclusion of a successful raid.<br>
<br>
     C -- You may ONLY sign up for yourself (if independent) or your guild (if guilded.)  Signups which say things like &quot;Jack Sprat the cleric would like to be added to the list....thanks very much....Sincerely, Joe Blow the Paladin.&quot;  Are invalid sign ups and will be dismissed.<br>
<br>
     D -- THE RAID FORUMS MODERATOR MAY NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ISSUE ADVANCE WARNING TO ANY BRELL SERILIS PLAYER OR GUILD OF HIS/HER INTENTION TO OPEN ROTATION LISTS SIGN UPS.  (Duh....but its best to say these things out loud so no one thinks I'm trying to pull a fast one here.)<br>
<br>
     E -- A thread in the signups forum called &quot;Rotation Lists -- Cancellations&quot; shall be created by the raid forums moderator.  In the event that a guild or IRO wishes to relinquish his/her/their spot on any rotation list, they will post in this forum and the spot in question shall be relinquished.<br>
<br>
     F -- The cancellations thread shall be locked by the raid forums moderator whenever ANY sign ups for ANY rotation lists are being accepted.  This is to prevent individuals from claiming what they perceive to be more desirable spots on more desirable rotations after hogging spots on &quot;less&quot; desirable rotations.  (To wit: You can't hog a spot on the Naggy list and then suddenly jump ship when you realize you're early enough to grab a spot on Venril's sign ups.  If you want to hold the Naggy spot, you're going to hold it at the expense of your spot on other lists.)<br>
<br>
     G -- Any individual who conspires via use of alternate EZboard accounts or alternate characters to reserve more than the allowable number of rotations spots as outlined in rule 2 shall forfeit ALL of his or her rotation spots upon discovery of the subterfuge.  If that individual is in a guild, that guild shall forfeit ALL of its rotations spots.  (Note...I know it is possible that a guild member could &quot;go rogue&quot; and conspire to screw up his or her guild.  This rule would hopefully never have to be enforced, and if it was, we'd sure talk it over first.)<br>
<br>
<br>
4.  ROTATION LIST MOBS -- KILL PERIODS<br>
<br>
     A -- No IRO or guild may &quot;pass&quot; a turn when they are up on a rotation list.  The mob must either be killed in the proscribed time period, or the spot vacated and killing rights to the mob passed to the next reservation on the list.<br>
<br>
     B -- Mobs shall be dispatched within the following time parameters.  Failure to dispatch a mob within these time parameters voids the rotation list reservation and the right to kill the mob passes to the next IRO or guild on the list.<br>
<br>
VOX/NAGAFEN: Deadline for slaughter, 1159PM pacific time three FULL days after spawn due to previous kill or planned server reset.  Or four FULL days after unplanned server reset or previously unsuccessful raid.<br>
<br>
VENRIL/TRAK: Deadline for slaughter, 1159PM pacific time, two FULL days after spawn due to previous kill or planned server rest.  Or three FULL days after unplanned server reset or previously unsuccessful raid.<br>
<br>
Explanations and Examples:  <br>
<br>
NAGAFEN is due to pop on tuesday around 4pm.  The next guild in line has until FRIDAY at 1159 pacific to kill him.<br>
<br>
NAGAFEN pops due to a patch outage at 230pm on thursday.  The next guild in line has until SUNDAY at 1159 pacific to kill him.<br>
<br>
NAGAFEN raid fails on friday night.  The next guild in line has until TUESDAY at 1159 pacific to kill him.<br>
<br>
NAGAFEN respawns saturday evening due to an unplanned server outage.  The next guild in line has until WEDNESDAY at 1159 pacific to kill him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay..that's it...sorry its so damn long.<br>

<br>
PROS:<br>
<br>
-- Large guilds are favored because they have more members available to them who constantly post on these boards; therefore, they have more of a chance to snag an open spot in a rotation list than a small guild.<br>
<br>
--Small guilds are favored because larger guilds and their members are not allowed to hog and monopolize these rare spawns under this system.  No preferential treatment is afforded a larger guild under this system other than the one listed above.  More members = more chances a guild will catch lucky during the sign up period.<br>
<br>
--Smaller guilds are encouraged to form alliances with each other in order to have more &quot;eyes on the board: for open rotation spots.<br>
<br>
--Independents are guaranteed spots in the rotations, thus preserving everyone's right to participate in all aspects of Everquest and controverting the disadvantage they are at since they have only one person (themselves) who can reserve a spot in a rotation.<br>
<br>
--The limitation on the number of threads in which a guild or individual can hold an active spot reduces &quot;list hogging&quot; and encourages everyone to sign up for ONLY those mobs which they actually intend to kill.<br>
<br>
--It is no longer necessary for level 22 characters to place their names on the Nagafen/Vox rotations in a vain attempt to assure themselves the opportunity to kill these epic monsters once they reach the appropriate level of skill.<br>
<br>
<br>
CONS:<br>
<br>
--Potential abuse on the part of the moderator.  (To wit, if I'm the moderator in question, I could tell my guild, &quot;Hey, i'm about to open the Venril sign-ups.  Someone go out there and snag our spot when I do.&quot;  Anyone who knows me at all knows I would never do this, but its best to get this out in the open because I'm sure it will occur to many of you.)<br>
<br>
--The threat of the random.  That is, if luck isn't on your side, you or your guild might hit a &quot;cold spell&quot; where you can't luck up and hit the boards when the sign up threads are open.  This is a risk with any somewhat random system.<br>
<br>
--Board camping:  Although I don't see this happening, someone could conceivably camp the board waiting for the threads to open.  I would personally combat this by opening threads at varied times throughout the day and week when they are needed.  Honestly though, I don't see this as much as a problem.  The first time a board camper finds himself sitting on the Venril thread for 3 solid weeks waiting for it to open, this will be a moot issue.<br>
<br>
That's all I have....thanks for reading. <p><BR>

<br>
Two things that need work imo:<br>
<br>
ONE<br>
I don't think it addresses the core problem well enough. The core problem in my eyes is the fact that one person, most likely a cleric/wizard because people always need more of those for raids, with good connections to a bunch of guilds could still concievably attend 3 venril slayings in one two-week period while someone else who sticks tight to what their guild/group of friends is doing will only go once.<br>
<br>
I think there needs to be some sort of rule where after each raid the raid leader posts a list of people that actually attended the raid on the appropriate board. Then you can limit the number of times one person can attend a Venril raid per rotation (I would set the limit at 2 because it gives more people chances but still makes the more needed classes easier to find). This would also have the added effect of limiting the number of raid intentions posted because leaders have less people to pick from. I know other people have posted this idea before but maybe not quite in this form. Also I think this is very important because it is the only way to be (almost) precisely fair in a mathematical way to everyone. If we made it one time per rotation indies would get supershafted and it would just make things too difficult in general, not like this isn't extremely difficult already, but then again this is a big problem.<br>
<br>
TWO<br>
I really don't like the idea of camping the raid forums even though I never would do that. What is the point of playing a game where in order to accomplish something in game you go sit on out of game ezboard hitting refresh? That is not my idea of a good time playing EQ. But again, if you somehow fixed the first problem I mentioned this would probably not be very likely to occur, but in its present form I fear it is. Also it gives a strong advantage to someone with 2 computers.<br>
<br>
That's all, keep up the hard work Zest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzestrenocya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zestrenocya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Norrath's Finest Taxi Service</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#CC9900>(11/17/00 11:30:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DRAGON/VS ROTATONS -- A Proposal</span><hr size=1> Shelehan:<br>
<br>
I see your points.  One I mentioned myself, the other I fear is invalid.  I'll address them individually.<br>
<br>
ONE:  The idea that someone can attend three venril slayings, for example, in two weeks.  Well, I don't see as there's anything that we can or even SHOULD do about that.  If Jane the Cleric has cultivated that many friends and such a valuable reputation amongst the members of the Brell community that she is invited on such a wide variety of raids by a wide variety of individuals and guilds, I see no reason why she should be denied reaping the benefits of her strong support in the community.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, were I to organize a Trakanon raid or Venril raid, I, as the raid organizer, would take whom I pleased on my raid.  It is not the business of the community to tell me or my guild who our friends and members can be.  This would be wholly inappropriate.  Particularly as concerns guilds.  If an independent individual were to Xaviel on a Venril raid, would the server then tell Ganon as the SR raid organizer for Venril the following week that he could not invite his guildbrother to the guild's Venril raid because Xaviel had just attended one?  This smacks entirely too much of big brother to me.  <br>
<br>
TWO:  Regarding the &quot;camping&quot; of the sign up lists.  On average, were this proposal adopted, the sign up lists for Venril (as an example) would be opened at a random time once every four weeks with four spots available.  I just don't see someone devoting THAT much forum camping time to making sure they score a spot on the Venril list under these guidelines.  Naturally, I could be wrong....sometimes we do some strange things as regards this game.  I see your point, but I had that in mind to a certain extent when I developed the plan.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your input. <p><BR>

<br>
As for the comment of limiting individuals from ATTENDING multiple raids is something we should not touch PERIOD.   Reputations are everything.  If you have a good rep allowing you to be asked to multiple raids then you deserve to go.  If you have a crap rep and can't get asked then you deserve it.   If you have a neutral rep and have a hard time getting an invite...well then you just need to talk to a few people to get a bit better known.  It isn't that hard.  <br>

<br>
No seriously, so far its been one of the best thought out systems, with pretty much all the bases covered. Very little room for abuse I was gonna meantion something about not allowing any 1 guild to sign up on all 4 dragon lists. making em choose between 2 making the lists  smaller. Even if the same guild signs up for VS and trak over and over again sooner or later they'll have gotten everything they need from the two dragons and forget about em. I don't have any problems or concerns about this system, I would vote putting this system into place as soon as it could be done.<br>
<br>
After giving it some thought I would agree with Twiggie if joe smith has no life and can play 24/7 and be on every single raid every held let him. I don't think I'd like to much if you someone told me I played too long and I couldn't do something because whenever I typed /play it said &quot;We lost count on the number of years you've got logged on&quot;<br>

<br>
However; is there a possibility that we could add the three Planes to the limit of the number of raid rotations a guild or independent is allowed to be on?<br>
<br>
What I am seeing when I look at all of the available resources being utilized on the server looks something like this:<br>
<br>
Guild 1 - Trakanon, Venril, Hate.<br>
Guild 2 - Trakanon, Venril, Nagafen, Vox, Hate, Fear, Sky.<br>
Guild 3 - Nagafen, Vox, Venril, Hate, Sky, Fear.<br>
Guild 4 - Nagafen, Hate, Fear, Sky.<br>
Guild 5 - Vox, Trakanon, Hate, Fear, Sky.<br>
Guild 6 - Trakanon, Venril, Hate, Sky.<br>
Guild 7 - Venril, Hate, Fear, Sky.<br>
Guild 8 - Trakanon, Venril, Sky, Fear, Hate, Nagafen, Vox.<br>
Independent 1 - Venril, Fear, Hate, Sky.<br>
Independent 2 - Venril, Hate, Fear.<br>
Independent 3 - Nagafen, Vox, Fear, Hate.<br>
<br>
Looking at the above situation, it's obvious that certain guilds and independents are taking up more of the resources than others.  <br>
<br>
First, we need to understand that with a limited number of resources, such as what we have on this server, each of those resources become more valuable.  <br>
<br>
Second, we need to compromise and realize that if we all insist on raiding every mob and Plane everyday, we're not spreading the resources around.<br>
<br>
The real problem with the overcrowding situation is that, as the server's population matures, there are a limited number of places to do things.  I believe the Planes are one of those exciting spots.  I still get an adrenaline rush on the upper isles of Sky, and even SR has been wiped out ocassionally in Hate.<br>
<br>
I also believe that guilds or groups of individuals need excessive practice with the easier areas and mobs before they take on the harder ones.  For example, if a guild or group cannot take down Nagafen or Vox reliably, they have no business taking a spot on the Venril or Trakanon lists.<br>
<br>
My proposed addition to your system looks like this:<br>
<br>
Thoric, representing SR, is signed up for Venril and Hate.  SR is not allowed to schedule a Trakanon, Fear, Nagafen, Sky, or Vox raid while they are on the Venril and Hate lists.<br>
<br>
The Planes list rotations go by quickly.  I realize that you would have to increase the rotation to 14 for the purpose of this inclusion<br>
<br>
Anyway, I like your original idea and would agree to it whether or not the three Planes are included.  I just think we need to realize that Hate, Fear, and Sky are also resources that everyone wants to utilize.  It would be a shame to de-value their ability to occupy our time. <p>Ganon Stormwynd <BR>

She/He got what I was thinking on....limited capacities to many raiders. So you need to prevent people not guilds from signing on raids on and on. Make them pause for a set period of time after they have been to a raid.<br>
<br>
If there are not enough people to start the raids maybe due to less signups let first of those who are still in time off plane x back to duty.<br>
Exceptional monster not included of course. I mean those which only 1 or 2 guilds are raiding.<br>
<br>
Oh now I have a little question to Ganon what does this quote mean or maybe I am just lacking my poor english and did get it wrong.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I also believe that guilds or groups of individuals need excessive practice with the easier areas and mobs before they take on the harder ones. For example, if a guild or group cannot take down Nagafen or Vox reliably, they have no business taking a spot on the Venril or Trakanon lists.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
So what does this mean? If I get it right I sign up to a raid of Nagafen and my group gets slaughtered. You are standing in the back as the judge and say: Hey that was poor keep on practising until its your turn for VS. You are off for VS postings.<br>
I mean who will be the judge to what is RELIABLY?<br>
Or does GUILD/PEOPLE X always mean this is reliable? I hope you got what I wanted to say with this quote and shit can happen anytime.<br>

I think you should only be able to schedule ONE plane raid (Hate or Fear) in a given 2 week period.  The same rule that is now for signing up for one plane should be extended to both planes.  You can't sign up for another raid until the first one is finished.  Maybe add a clause where if the plane is still unreserved at Midnight board time the day before that it is then open for anyone to take.   So for example, its Monday, SR has Hate reserved on Friday, on Tuesday night no one has reserved Fear yet for Wednesday so at Midnight Board Time on Wednesday SR can sign up for the unclaimed Fear spot on Wednesday even though they have a Hate raid Friday.  Even if the unclaimed spot was Hate and they have a hate raid for Friday let them take the unclaimed spot.  Granted these empty spots aren't there much but if they are let someone take them at the last minute even if they have another raid scheduled. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for Indy's being on more than one Ubermob sign up.  I think that an Indy should be limited to ONE slot on any ubermob list.   There are advantages and disadvantages to being Indy.   One of the advantages is not being limited to what you can sign up on based on others.  Guildmember_01 can't sign up to host a raid if his Guildmate_02 already has a spot.  Also you can get in other people's raids since you don't have a commitment to a guild.   The disadvantages is that you aren't able to host as many raids in certain period of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Limits I would recommend:<br>
<br>
Guilds:<br>
-  1 plane raid (Hate/Fear) in a 2 week period (exception is the 24 hour rule on unreserved spots)<br>
-  2 Ubermob slots at any one time.<br>
-  Sky raids seperate from all this.<br>
<br>
Indy<br>
-  1 plane raid (Hate/Fear) in a 2 week period (exception is the 24 hour rule on unreserved spots)<br>
-  1 Ubermob slot at any one time.<br>
-  Sky raids seperate from all this.<br>
<br>
There will very quickly be many Indy raid hosts so the amount of slots they are allowed to take up should be limited so that all the Indy's have a fair chance at getting a slot.  If an Indy wants to host VS then they should not be able to host Vox/Naggy/Trak until they complete the VS raid and sign up again.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 4 ubermob spawns, at 10 slots each that gives 40 spots on the lists.  As it stands in this proposal we have:<br>
<br>
24 Guild Reservable Slots minimum and up to 36 slots maximum.<br>
<br>
A minimum of 4 Indy Slots and up to a maximum of 12 slots.<br>
<br>
That would give a minimum of 12 guilds slots on the ubermobs (assuming each gets 2 spots) up to a maximum of 36 guilds (assuming each gets 1 spot) with the average ending up probably around 24 guilds having slots.  <br>
<br>
With a limit of one raid per Indy that would give from minimum of 4 to maximum of 16 slots available for Indy's. If you went with the 2 limit proposed now that would cut in half the number of slots available to Indy's and you would have some Indy's having 2 raids while others wouldn't have any.  That Indy that has Trak reserved is still free to Host a Hate/Fear raid and a Sky raid while having the Trak reservation and is still free to join any other raid that they wish they just can't HOST another Ubermob spawn while reserving Trak.<br>

<br>
In reference to the Sky/Hate/Fear discussion which is cropping up here, when I made this proposal, I intended it to serve ONLY for the Dragons and Venril Sathir as I personally feel that this is where our biggest difficulties lie.  However, in light of the thoughts posted here concerning the planes, I have made a second proposal concerning our reservation system for those planes.  That thread can be found here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=952.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fbrells...=952.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Please post comments and discussion on that issue in the thread above.  I feel, personally, that it is necessary to keep these two issues separate mainly because while the &quot;Ubermob&quot; questions have ignited passions in the game and here on the boards, the planar reservation question seems to be &quot;less pressing&quot; if you will.  This is not to cheapen the concerns of those who have posted here.  Just my thoughts on the subject.<br>
<br>
Thanks....Again, I'll post replies and my thoughts here this afternoon.<br>

<br>
Ganon and Twiggie (primarily):<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with you for two reasons.  First, the planes work as they are now.  I think they can use a little tweaking, that's why I posted the other thread in this forum.  But for the most part, I'm not seeing a great many complaints about hate/fear around here.  Most individuals seem to feel that, while they're crowded and it takes some board camping to get a primo day, they're working.  If you have any doubt, check the calendar.  There are presently one fear and two hate dates unclaimed.  True, they're on those primo raid days, tuesday through thursday, but they DO exist.  Those dates have been open for sign ups for several days now and no one has claimed them.<br>
<br>
Second...and more importantly.  <br>
<br>
I want to play too.<br>
<br>
The system, as its created, minimizes the impact as much as possible on the raid forums moderator.  If we were to include the planes here, I'd spend the vast majority of my free play time cross referencing things to make sure that its legal for Enshadowed to sign up for that hate or fear raid they'd like to take because I'm not sure which lists they hold places on.  Maybe there's someone out there who WOULD enjoy this job and keep the forums in order and fair while still being able to play the game.  But it couldn't be me.  The sheer volume of time that would require would be overwhelming.  And one thing we DON'T want if this system is adopted is switching moderators every six weeks.  That would very much be a bad thing.<br>
<br>

<br>
Vidraj, Shelehan (again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   /hug):<br>
<br>
In reference to the idea that we should limit the number of raids any given PERSON can attend.  That's something that people should self-police.  And if they can't, then someone who's an interested party can talk to them about it in a calm and rational manner.  If you think that Zesty has been on entirely too many fear raids lately, say something to me.  Worst thing that can happen is I come back and say &quot;who the hell are you to say that?&quot;  You then calmly go on your way and forget it.  But for the most part, I don't think these things happen too often around here.  We have an &quot;old boy network&quot; to a certain extent, I admit.  But everyone here is interested in keeping things fair.  If we weren't, there wouldn't be a Brell Board.  I mean, you don't see me signing up for every Venril raid on the boards, and I need the little stone he drops just like most every other druid on the server.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, something like this would absolute DWARF the time commitment required by the idea above about linking planar raids and the ubermob raids.  We have something on the order of probably 2500 &quot;active&quot; players on brell.  Can you imagine the time investment necessary to catalouge each one of those players, what alts he or she has that are played regularly, and then try to make sure that he/she gets on his &quot;fair share&quot; of raids?  I'd never log on again.  In fact, I might have to quit my job.<br>
<br>
Your suggestion has merit but is too socialist in its scope.  In an absolutely PERFECT world, every player on Brell would get to share absolutely equally in all these things.  But this isn't a perfect world here on Brell.  We're just trying to make it as good as we can.  As for getting on raids, every member of the Brell society has two weapons available to him.  This board and his reputation.  Both of them can be utilized to encourage raids to let him join.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
Vumil, Thoric, and others:<br>
<br>
I agree personally, about limiting IRO's to one spot on the respective rotations.  If there is a compelling reason that IRO's should NOT have this limitation, I'd love to hear it from them.  IRO's are already guaranteed spots on the rotations which no individual guild is.  <br>
<br>
The compelling reason for this, to me, is Twiggies argument that indivdual IRO's will be &quot;cut out of the loop&quot; so to speak by a single indy raid leader holding more than one spot on the lists.  Additionally, the IRO represents only one person whereas a guild represents many.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Last, a request.  If you have friends who use this board, direct them to these threads and ask them to post their thoughts.  The feedback is important.  I honestly feel that this is the best solution we've seen so far around here.  (Well, naturally I do.  I wrote it.) but we can't go ahead and just change things based on the input of ten or fourteen people.  I don't care if I win the pulitzer or something....<br>
<br>
....which I feel like maybe I should with all this typing.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Thanks everyone for your feedback. <p><BR>

Zest that is a moderator makes a spot in a rotation availeble at 4 am CET on a tuesday. Now how am I supposed to make this date?<br>
<br>
Due to this board being on PST time and you all slate that I cant book a raid on any other time frame than this board's makes it hard enough for me to get a plane raid.<br>
<br>
Doing the same for rotation's would cut us totally out of it.<br>

And I really dont want anyone from going on raid after raid<br>
if thats his primary goal. I wouldnt even have the time raiding as much as most of you with working 5-6 days a week.<br>
Maybe someone now says so why is he posting.....and I have to say: Its just I like the way our server is compared to others and as I started playing on Brell I havent had the slightest notion that Brell will become so special.<br>
<br>
Last thought...dont quit your job....do it during your lunchbreak....really I admire what you have begun and how you deal with it.<br>

This still doesn't eliminate raid camping.  Some people work on computers all day and can post at ANY time within seconds.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER beat them to the punch.  I work as a Private Investigator and if I am home, I am playing EQ.<br>
<br>
I have to be able to post at any time and be guaranteed a chance to get a spot.<br>
<br>
2nd problem is this doesn't eliminate the number of people raiding.  What we need is to reduce the number... not reduce the size of the list.  You can do this by saying, you have to provide a certain amount of the raid if you are a guild... and for indy's by limiting the amount of indies.<br>
<br>
Do you really think it's fair for FOUR indies to be signed up for a Trak or VS raid.  They represent FOUR people.  While those 6 guilds represent 60 - 600 people.  Not fair at all.  While I know the guilds have to give somewhere... they shouldn't be sacraficing THAT much to be guilded.  Each guild represents far more than that one indy does.<br>
<br>
The problem is people aren't caring about anything but themselves. (before you say shit, there is NOTHING off of Trak or VS that I need / want, manarobe would go to a wizard before me, on my vote).  Look at TBS!?  There is NO WAY in hell they can host a successful Trakanon raid, yet they are signed up for it.  What will they be doing?  Pleading for others to help them the whole time.  They haven't even pulled Trak's lair yet.  This isn't to say TBS is a bad guild... but damn guys... don't be ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Everyone has the right to fail and experiment but at least put some effort into failing with a chance.  And no.. not the chance that Trak will sit and LET you hit him and not fight back TBS.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows I am blunt.  I will always be so.  But SR, Enshadowed, LoH, Watchers and SD probably make up 1 / 2 of the active high level 55 + players.  Yet they are allowed to raid 1 / 20th of the high level stuff.  Doesn't seem fair.<br>
<br>
Find a system that lowers the number of people signing up (by making guilds group together to provide a perecentage of the people for the raid and thus eliminating so many guilds signing up, or something else) instead of just makes it NECESSARY to camp this board every day.  When it becomes MORE work to camp this board then to play the game, is the day when we all stop camping this board and just do what we want.  *that's not a threat, but the truth*<br>
<br>
Anyways, there's my problems with it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
