HELL LEVELS..WHY?!?!?!?!(turned into general EQ rant =)</span><hr size=1> Ok, well, I am SURE theres gotta be a rant here somewhere but...I live in Europe, I like playing EQ lots but its getting to a point where I am just not interested in it. What is there to look forward to from level 32? in the immediate future? nought! Hell level 35! WOOHOO OH BOY! i cant wait!!! Supposedly much worse than 30, and that took me 2 weeks to do. If I didn't work and I could spend 24/7 playing EQ, this wouldnt bother me, but now, I cannot group with at least 75% of my friends because they are level 50 and im still level 32! Sure, If it wern't for hell levels they would have been level 50 earlier and it would be the same thing (but thats far to normal a thought for me right now). <BR>     I PAY for my local calls, so for example, it takes 1 day/played to get through 30, thats NOT free, that is a fair bit o' cash to me, then i die in level 31 and woohoo! double exp loss in hell! Ok, um, is that fun? nope! not even just time wasted either, I wasted real cash. <BR>     What about Evercamp? Paw of Opolla! LOL! this is a JOKE CAMP! You either get really lucky, get it in 10hrs, OR, like me, you kill 300+ mitty's and get a squillion (yes i counted them) copper rings and no sign of the gold ring (2 non-magical gold rings to REALLY annoy you though). That is NOT fun Verant...Sitting around, the timer beeps, you kill mitty, then sit about again? Boooooooring. <BR>     What about Neverquest? What quests are there for druids that reward us with something half decent? I have been doing the shaman and crafted quests, half decent fun, but what about myself? I wouldn't mind some quests that pertain to my actual class! <BR>      What about Neversex? Well, when I'm with my gf EQ doesn't even get a lookin, so no worries here =) <BR>     Thw funny thing about all this is...what can I do about it? Hmm...I can SELL my account...what does this mean? someone else pays the same bill, Verant make the same cash, so why do they care? they dont simple =). EQ is a good game...Verant wants you to group because it would be so incredibly boring if you didn't. Imagine EQ as a single-player offline game. Can you see yourself sitting down because you want to get a runed mithril bracer? a Ykesha? Would a one player game like EQ sell? heck no! the only reason this game is fun is not because of the game, but because the interaction it provides by meeting other people and to others, the competition of Equipment/levels.  <BR>      Once again I wonder how much i could get for my account =) Maybe I need a trade =)Oh well, whatever the future holds.... <BR>  <BR>    Understand that i do NOT hate EQ. I enjoy the game still but there are so many things about it i do not like, it makes me wonder what it is i really enjoy? Is it the gameplay? or the interaction with other people? Wouldn't it be better to just go to a chat channel? there at least is no monthly fee.  <BR>  <BR>    Ok, now you can all say whatever ya like =-) <BR>  <p>Filee Whytenose.

I have recently taken a 2-1/2 week hiatus from NeverQuest but I havent quite decided to cancel my account yet.  Every day, I think I want to play, but then I ask myself &quot;Why?&quot; and &quot;what would I do if I logged on?&quot;  I refuse to play again until I can answer these questions.  <BR>  <BR> I play a game to have fun and I do expect a challenge (otherwise it wouldnt be fun!).  Don't get me wrong, for over four months I have had a lot of fun in the game. I belong to a great guild and I've met a lot of people I'd like to consider my friends.  But lately, the fun is few and far between, and the rest of it is boring, or more like a chore and I dunno about you, but I hate chores.  <BR>  <BR> Perhaps it's my play style, I have a couple characters at level 20-22 and another half dozen level 10-14.   The druid is the highest at level 22 and was my favorite character to play but I always seem to hit a wall with each character, maybe its what you call hell levels, but I get to a point where I spend more time dying than anything else, and I too, hate to think of all the hours work that just went down the drain. <BR>  <BR> Before I took my leave of absence from the game, I spent 11 days camping for the last page for my Testament of Vanear (sp?).  The smuggler is roughly an 8 hour spawn.  Why?  The only thing he drops is Lore - No Drop so it's not like you could sell it.  If you could I would have gladly bought one rather than go thru this ordeal.  So how to catch this spawn? Bind there and keep coming back only to find it camped (I tried this for a while), or camp it myself.  Hmmm.. nothing I enjoy more than sitting in the same spot for 8 hours while everyone else is actually playing the game.  Ok, got my baking skill maxed, at least its something to do while I wait.  Half an hour before spawn, first person shows up.  &quot;You waiting for spawn?&quot; No, I just like sitting here baking, of course I'm waiting for the spawn.  Next thing you know, people start coming in, and when the smuggler finally spawns, I dont stand a chance of getting the kill.  This happened more times than I care to mention.  Next thing I tried, was I figured when the spawn would be in the early hours of the morning, like 6AM, what are the chances someone would be camping it at that hour.  Just to be safe, I leave my character sitting there, in case anyone should come by, they'll see me and know I'm camping it.  I set my alarm clock and go to bed.  Well I should have set it for 5 minutes earlier, because of course, I was too late, I get to my computer just in time to see a cleric attacking the smuggler. Once again, I lose.  I just spent 11 days sitting in the game and baking, gaining NO EXP, NO ITEMS, basically NOTHING to show for it, except the phone bill. Meanwhile, all my friends I used to group with are approaching level 30. I cant even imagine undertaking some other quests, how long did it take you all to get a paw? <BR>  <BR> Since I started playing the game, my goal was to be one of the high level players and see all the cool high level zones, and get some of that cool, high level armour and weapons, and to help people and make friends along the way but that goal just seems further and further out of reach.  I know it can be done, there are plenty of high level people on my server and on this board.  But I just don't think I'm willing to invest all the hours, money, and AGGRAVATION it will cost.   I don't even want to think about all the hours I have already invested in the game.  Granted, I got a LOT of reading done while looking at the darn spell book or while camping, but is that fun? Is that playing?  Not to me.   <BR>  <BR> I know I'm going to be flamed, I know I'm going to be called a whiner and told not to let the door hit me on the way out.  I know I wont be hurting Verant any if I cancel my subscription.  But since this is a forum for discussing our thoughts and feelings about the game, that is all that I am doing.  I thought it interesting that you mentioned how would EQ sell if it were a single player game, it would'nt stand a chance.  For now, for me, when it's time to game, and I consider my options, I am choosing Age of Empires 2 or the new Pharoah game.  I do miss my friends on EQ, but at least I am having fun, and isn't that the purpose of leisure time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=foofur>Foofur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/5/01 7:54:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok, RANT TIME!

This curve is corrected every five levels starting at 30 which translates into they require extra experience at these levels for the correction.  It is a matter of imperfect code rather than VI wanting to make certain levels more difficult to get through.<br>
