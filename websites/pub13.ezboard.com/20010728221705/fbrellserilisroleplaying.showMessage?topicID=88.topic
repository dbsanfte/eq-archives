The sun was shining, and it was warm, but not too hot. He stepped outside and looked into the sky. There were little puffy clouds floating leisurely through the blue sky. He yawned and walked back inside, his spirits lifted by this beautiful spring day.  He walked down the hall to make breakfast for his siblings, and noted that the floor was sticky in front of Dumbly and Dudley’s room. He made a point of looking at it after he made breakfast. <br>
<br>
Maggendy awoke to the smell of bacon frying. She quickly got dressed and headed for the kitchen, not one to miss a good meal. She stopped in front of Dumbly and Dudley’s room. She thought the floor was sticky, but thought Dumbly had spilt his favorite drink, honey mead. With the thirst for honey mead in her head, she went to the kitchen for breakfast.<br>
<br>
Dodley woke up thinking about the strange sounds he had heard during the night. Meaning to get up and inquire about them, he stood up, realized how tired he was and promptly went back to sleep.<br>
<br>
“Golly Didley, the floor in front of Dumbly’s room was sure sticky.” Maggendy stated through a mouth full of bacon.<br>
“Bah, Didley thinks that whenever Dumbly wakes up, he can clean it up.” Didley said, slightly annoyed. “Since Mom and Dad were killed, Dumbly and Dudley have been too busy to clean, so Didley has had to clean every thing, and Didley sick of it.”<br>
Maggendy chewed thoughtfully for a minute then stated, “Golly, that is sure mean of them.”<br>
Didley just gave her a stern look. They looked at each other, chuckled quietly and continued eating.<br>
<br>
Dodley awoke for the second time with a slight sense of loss. He couldn’t explain what he had lost, but he didn’t want to discount it. He stepped out into the hall and noticed the sticky spot. “Dodley find a sticky spot on the floor!” he shouted to his brother. Getting no reply, he bent over to examine the sticky spot. It was red, and was once a liquid. He thought that it was honey mead, but there was something wrong. The bitter smell of the alcohol was missing. He put his fingers into the pool, and tasted the liquid. It was blood! He quickly ran into Dudley and Dumbly’s room. In it he found a letter explaining their leaving. Dodley sobbed silently.<br>
“A pity eh? I wished to kill them as the left, but I found recovering from my injuries a bit more difficult than I had expected.”<br>
Dodley jumped backwards and tried to run, but he slipped in the puddle of blood and fell down.<br>
With that, Hottil knocked Dodley out and headed to the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Maggendy stood up and walked over to the washtub to clean off her plate. She did not see Hottil come up, nor did she see him silently incapacitate Didley with a swift blow to the head. The next thing she knew was that Hottil had her. He tied her up and threw her out side. <br>
“I will be back when I have finished with your brothers!” Hottil snarled.<br>
Maggendy quickly got loose of her bindings and ran off into misty thicket.<br>
<br>
Once in the house, Hottil started tying Didley up. Suddenly, he felt his skin burn. He turned in time to see Dodley casting another spell. Hottil was suddenly engulfed in a stinging swarm. He decided that at least he had Maggendy, so he ran. Dodley did not give chase but went to the aid of his brother. They both went outside and attempted to find Maggendy, but to no avail. They returned to the house and tried to think of how they would get Maggendy back.<br>
