My friend who plays a champ now as well as in beta commented in the first few days that the DEX buff seemed a little odd as compared to the end of beta.<br>
<br>
*toots his own horn really hard* I put the Champ class through the most thurough testing during beta. I was the only one to actually put up solid information that was backupped with actual logs and testing versus enemy realm players. I met with several players to do nothing but test the effects of Champ spells. <br>
<br>
Prior to Champs being adjusted with less then a week to go in beta the STR/CON debuff was extremely overpowered, yes it had a CON effect as well at the time. At lvl 32 i could debuff 91 pts off of both STR and CON, 91 STR would encumber all but Troll Tank classes. Combination of STR debuff and snare and you basically rooted any class in the game. The Con part of the debuff had a nasty side effect, for the length of the debuff i would effectively stripped 300 or so HPs off of an opponent. Basically a 300dmg DD spell that couldnt be healed. <br>
<br>
Prior to the patch in beta the DEX debuff was DEX/QUI and woulda also strip 91 pts from each. Other then using it as an interupt against archers and casters it really was worthless in huge 100+ player melees. One vs One it was pretty devastating as it reduced Atk Rate/Atk Dmg/Weap Skill. My Champ was a freaking bad arse in RvR prior to the first patch, I routinely made short work of orange and red con tanks with my champ. One fight I nearly took down a purple con dorf healer that got the jump on me, mez'd me right off the bat in the fight and eventually had to call for backup to save him since i was beating him down so badly.<br>
<br>
At lvl 30 i claimed partial credit in killing a lvl 42 kobold shaman because my debuffs that i stuck to her as i died to her DOT made it impossible for her to root off a yellow to me mob and she was to encumbered to get away from it =) She ended up taking an exp loss death on that one =-)<br>
<br>
The patch came, it dropped the debuffs from 91 to STR/CON/DEX/QUI down to something like 53. Effectively making them worthless in RvR, and making them even more worthless to PvE. The only spells i ever used in PvE was DD and Atk Spd Debuff as the stat debuffs used END that i could put to better use with melee styles.<br>
<br>
I knew that changes were gonna have to happen to the Champ prior to going live, I lobbied for changes to the stat debuffs, but my pleads fell unanswered. The way i saw it the stat debuffs were suppose to work as such.<br>
-STR was not suppose to encumber only to degrade the melee capability of a player. I lobbied for the effect to be more like Rez Effects were the stats effected were the Weap Skill and Weap Dmg rather then STR stat itself. <br>
-CON have no clue what effect they wanted. But i lobbied for a spell that would work like a DD spell to the endurance bar. Nuking away valuable endurance used for combat styles and sprinting.<br>
-DEX which effects both dmg done with the bow and dmg done with spells. I thought that if should just reduce the max dmg a spell or arrow would hit for.<br>
-QUI i would guess that this was to effect the Atk Speed of an opponent, but Champs already had a Atk Spd debuff. So i lobbied for the spells to be split from STR/CON and DEX/QUI to Melee Debuff, End DD, and Ranged Debuff.<br>
<br>
Champs as they stand now after being brought back in line, as they did when they were at the end of beta are light HP tanks that can snare runners in RvR, supplement their melee dmg with DD and can debuff a player or mobs Atk Spd. Doesnt offer much, but they freakin kick arse in RvR is all i know, instant shout DD spell = ownage in RvR. Even after the beta patch i was still and effective RvR'r, and i still intend to play a Champ as my second character =) <p><table>
