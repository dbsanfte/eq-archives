<br>
Basicly, we have a very weak system for implenenting new things, and its barely a system, infact how can it be a system without set rules besides, whoever has the most votes wins?<br>
<br>
I generaly hate the voting idea, its about as well thought out as DOT-COMs are nowadays. Like why would lvl 30's be allowed to vote on a nag/vox timelimit? Why would someone lvl 50 care about what only effects 60's in large guilds? Who says if its time for an issue to go to vote? Do we have a vote on whether its time to vote? (I think we do actually)<br>
<br>
And then who inforces these ideas? What if the rules are broken? Rules are broken all the time, amazingly an &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; heart felt or not, is good enough for you to do anything you want and beable to have everyoen forget about it a week later. Oh, except for those select few who you've REALLY hurt, but who cares about them right? as long as your &quot;sorry&quot;.<br>
<br>
I totaly agree with sinndaire (damn butchered yoru name =( I think) that just because girru said he was sorry and gave back the greaves, doesn't mean he should be forgiven. That means that ANYONE can do the same damn thing, and if they get caught, they just do what they should have done in the first place and its okay! (God I SOOO wana bust out a RL anology here, lemmi just say, &quot;Precidence&quot;)<br>
<br>
As well, people seem determined not to be bogged down with lots of rules, yet they want one system to be PERFECT for everybody. It doesn't work that way! Dynin's answer to my anology is WRONG, its only partly correct in that instance because there are no invalid options. Kill stealing, ninja'ing, etc are invalid looting options on brell. (If you dont knwo what I'm talking about, I said, you can't have a Low cost, mint condition BMW, or something to that sort)<br>

This really needs to be a major step twoards a better server. We need to establish law, right now were trying to go from Germanic Tribes, to Atlantis all in a day. It just doesn't happen.<br>

What a joke.  I think its fairly obvious I couldn't give two flips about the publics opinion of me.<br>

I follow the rules because they are a fair, peaceful, ordered system for all of the people.  People is what I care about.  People are more important then loot.  Period.  Running over people for loot is wrong.  Period.  I respect my peers.  And that respect is mutual.<br>

Vaal (36th level) answers:<br>
2 reasons<br>
1) Because at some point the 30th levels will be in their 40s and 50s, disenfranchise them now and they will be wondering why they have to follow rules they had no say in.<br>
2) They pay 10 bucks a month too<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I voted on the FG because I will, at some point, be able to do FG raids, because I currently do not does not mean my opinion should be ignored.<br>
<br>
I also did not vote on PoG or any of the planar discussions because I am a long way from getting there and as such, feel the people that are feeling the affects the most (40s and 50s) should have their thoughts heard. <p>Vaal Khon'Elvair <BR>

<br>
3) Because the notion of scarce resources isn't something one magically becomes aware of at level 50.  The concept that something spawns every x hours and y people want a shot at it isn't rocket science, it's basic sharing principals... kindergarten stuff not PhD equivalent.<br>
<br>
Level x gives you an insight into the game, not an insight into resources.  If Vaal or I are trying to explain the proper method of fighting MoBx (assuming MoBx is something a mid 40's can't take), then we're at best talking theory and worst talking over our heads.  However, figuring out what a fair reservation system is (number of times you can bid on a spot, duration of raid calendar, etc.) these are not concepts unique to Everquest... I'd venture to say a few of us below level 60 actually have some actual real world expertise in resource management... even without a dragon, go figger.<br>
<br>
Reservations and a respectable working server environment aren't level dependant.<br>
<br>
As Minute said, the reason the system as it stands generally works isn't the threat of 'blacklisting' (although that does influence some), the reason that it works is because a majority of the people actually find it to be as fair of a situation as you're going to find in Everquest.  We don't need a hypothetical of a &quot;FFA&quot; &quot;FCFS&quot; server mentailtiy... it takes all of 10 seconds on any discussion board to notice that it hasn't worked... anywhere.  Perfect system... nope, the system becomes imperfect the moment you introduce variables (people) to the equation.<br>
<br>
Regarding the enforcement idea.  There will always be pukes that avoid the system... Things would be a lot better if there was consistency in dealing with those pukes... and if there was a bit more communication in why the puke was a puke.  In the short run, the people that exploit the system actually do get ahead, in the long run they don't.  Generally after a while they end up forcibly starting a new character or a new server or posting that &quot;their brother was playing the account.&quot;  Some of them get accepted back into the 'community', some don't...  If you need punishments to make the majority follow the system you've got a bad system.  For the minority that don't... gentle pressure eventually works.<br>

Not really any 'points' made here.  You don't like the current system, you like hard and fast rules, you don't live voting.  No points, just opinions.<br>

Point One - You don't like voting.  Granted, the fact that a representative system (i.e. voting) certainly seems to be a functional one in most every other social setting, but you don't like it.  We get the point.<br>
<br>
Point Two - You want to be certain that 'certain' people don't have a right to voice their opinion.  Vaal and I both responded to this... course, then again you don't want to recognize that opininion as valid so we're just 'preaching.'<br>
<br>

<br>
Now here you have a point.  Your point is that without enforcement the system doesn't work.  This is certainly a valid opinion.  However, Minute quite effectively pointed out that he follows the system (that you don't like) becuase it's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  fair</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> system, not because it's an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  enforced</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> system.  <br>
<br>
I also responded to your point here by noting that (1) some people will always flaunt the system and that there isn't much you can do about it besides lean on them and (2) if the system <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  requires</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> heavy rules to enforce it's not a very good system.  <br>
<br>
Minute also pointed out, quite correctly, that a simple system with minimal rules is more likely to be adhered to than a rigid fixed one.  These are what might be referred to as counter points... When confronted with a counterpoint, one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seek evidence to back up ones original points, one could concede the counterpoint, or one could whine &quot;preach, preach, preach.&quot;  You see... it's not much of a debate/discussion if it's &quot;my way or you're preaching.&quot;  But hell, I'm not level 50 yet so I probably don't understand discussion any better than I understand scarcity, right?<br>
<br>
Query on your point - Who determines if an apology is 'heart felt or not'?  Is this a skill that comes after level 50 that I apparantly missed on spoiler sites? (I'll now agree to drop the level based arguments if you'll try not to treat me like a gimped child because in this social setting you've reached a level I have).<br>

<br>
Point - You're observing that Brell tends to allow bad server behavior by passivity.  I actually concur with you on this one.  Belial can steal an SMR and run a hate raid with experienced raiders, not planar newbies.  Other situations occur where people flaunt not the system, but the community, then get to rejoin shortly afterwards.  It <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  seems</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like there is more benefit to screwing the system than playing by the rules (as such as we have rules).  <br>
<br>
I will agree that the system will work better if blatant rule violaters are leaned on a lot heavier.  In a system without enforcement capability (which face it, any server community set of rules isn't enforcable) public censure is the only viable enforcement.  The problem is, public pressure isn't perfect and some people will slip under the radar on occaision... you just keep doing the right thing is all.  OTOH, when have you leaned enough?  At what point is an apology 'heartfelt?'  Sometimes you just have to take compensation and an apology and then hope to never see a recurrence from that character.<br>

Point - You want rules.  You want hard and fast rules and you want them enforcable.  By the way, your BMW analogy is incorrect.  A BMW is a mechanical device and follows certain rules of engineering and manufacturing.  <br>
<br>
Social structures involving people are never perfect, there is no 'one fit' mold that will make everyone happy.  Case in point, you're not happy with the existing set of rules, Minute is.  You want a more rigid, defined set of rules, and I think it's clear that others don't.  <br>
<br>
There isn't likely an option that is perfect for everyone.  So, where social systems differ from production systems is the notion of compromise... give and take (although that does in fact exist in production models also, but that's a tangent).  <br>
<br>
One thing that is generally true in large group management, the more cumbersome the ruleset, the less likely people will even pay attention to it, let alone follow it.  A simple set of rules, a spirit of fairplay... that works.  Oddly, that's the system <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  your</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> guild helped create.  <br>
<br>
It's not perfect, it isn't going to be perfect.  It's not enforcable, no system is enforcable.  I see a lot of sentiment to 'working it out in the game,' and frankly that seems absurd to me.  In game, more often than not, the wrong has already occurred and tempers are smoking... not exactly the place to work out an issue.  Also, I go to the game for recreation... not politics and logistics... I can't remotely fathom why someone would want to bring stress in game that could be adressed in advance here.<br>
<br>
Now, I hope I've identified the relevant points in your post and addressed them?  If not, please specify these points... I'd hate to waste my time preaching.<br>

Your awesome, I love how you've broken down, addressed every point, done it in a non-biased way, and done it without preaching. =)<br>
<br>
I wana explain what I mean by preaching real quick.  <br>
<br>
When your using yourself as an example, and talking about high your morals are, and how you would do something good, or how you would do the right thing, thats preaching. There is no reason to ever use yourself as an example, and I find you never even have to practice what you preach if your talking about philisophical issues. <br>
<br>
When your talking about the issue, the points and the dynamics of it, breaking it down, trying to find the root of the problem and solutions, thats going in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Now on with it.<br>
<br>
First quote:&quot;<br>
(I hate {quote})<br>
Sorta a continuence from part of another post I made.<br>
<br>
Basicly, we have a very weak system for implenenting new things, and its barely a system, infact how can it be a system without set rules besides, whoever has the most votes wins?&quot; <br>
<br>
I sorta hinted that, since we have no real rules for voting, we dont really have anything to go by.<br>
<br>
Second Quote:&quot;I generaly hate the voting idea, its about as well thought out as DOT-COMs are nowadays. Like why would lvl 30's be allowed to vote on a nag/vox timelimit? Why would someone lvl 50 care about what only effects 60's in large guilds? Who says if its time for an issue to go to vote? Do we have a vote on whether its time to vote? (I think we do actually)&quot;<br>
<br>
I can see where what I said didn't have the effect of what I inteneded. What I ment was that I dont like the voting system in its current form. Obviously most issues will be voted on, and I accept that.<br>
<br>
Your next point was a big one. You concentrate on the issues I presented, instead of the issues surrounding the issues. (heh, comon stay with me.)  The point most of you are missing is that you've been critisizing me on the questions I posed, instead of realizing that these are hotly debated topics and we have no system for deciding the outcome of such issues. <br>
<br>
Third Quote: &quot;And then who inforces these ideas? What if the rules are broken? Rules are broken all the time, amazingly an &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; heart felt or not, is good enough for you to do anything you want and beable to have everyoen forget about it a week later. Oh, except for those select few who you've REALLY hurt, but who cares about them right? as long as your &quot;sorry&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
I very much dislike seeing people doing immoral, decietfull, and just generaly wrong things and still being able to do whatever they like. If you betray the system/server you shouldn't have the good faith of the server. <br>
<br>
As far as people following systems with minimal rules, I think its only because it doesn't try to interfier to much that systems do such a thing. I'm not hoping for a system that outlines everything and everything so that we have a library of rules, I just want a descriptive set of rules, some defenitions of hotly debated terms, and like I said earlier some punishments if you break these rules.<br>
<br>
Answer to query. They steal something, they say fuck you, then say I'm sorry, please help with my fear raid. I'm not saying we should nitpick every I'm sorry, but there are times when its blatanly obvious. And this is another issue that is hotly debated, and unable to come to a conclusion without a set of rules for decing these things.<br>
<br>
Finalie:&quot;As well, people seem determined not to be bogged down with lots of rules, yet they want one system to be PERFECT for everybody. It doesn't work that way! Dynin's answer to my anology is WRONG, its only partly correct in that instance because there are no invalid options. Kill stealing, ninja'ing, etc are invalid looting options on brell. (If you dont knwo what I'm talking about, I said, you can't have a Low cost, mint condition BMW, or something to that sort)<br>
<br>
This really needs to be a major step twoards a better server. We need to establish law, right now were trying to go from Germanic Tribes, to Atlantis all in a day. It just doesn't happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
The bmw is an metaphor. I use it so its something you can relate to. Really what I'm trying to point out is that, the more we want our system to cover, the more complex it gets. We can't have it cover everything from Trak to Lava beetles and have it one paragraph.<br>
<br>
All my points are to greater emphasize the true issue the subject of this post, we aren't able to function efficiently because where doing this a half-assed way. I'm not looking for the in-game rules to change, I'm hoping we can get a system on the boards so that we can atleast discuss this stuff and come to conclusions, instead of it just winding on page 10, and issue unresolved.<br>
<br>
I'm not looking to change anything besides how we go about deciding things. Thats the point. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicophorus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicophorus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 365<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/6/01 2:32:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/nico.gif Border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   /grin</span><hr size=1> I agree with a lot of your general points.  Also, there are a few issues going on serverwise that are gettig me a bit hot under the collar... anything remotely resembling a flame in my long post is mostly collateral flak.<br>
<br>
The level thing tends to be a hot button for some of us though.  Like I said, if I'm trying to tell you how to raid Veeshan's Peak... I'm a moron... schedules though, that's different.<br>
<br>
I also saw your posts in another thread that I think started this thread... you're right about why things don't get done, it'll take a level of cooperation that just might not be possible right now on Brell.<br>
<br>
One idea to consider is moderated discussions.  Kind of like Goats thread on dropping the Intentions area.  However, that's beig handled wrong.  A good moderated discussion needs a moderator that's trying to stay neutral and pushing the debate.  Note, Goat is a good moderator for these boards... and would probably be a damned good moderator for the hypothetical discussions I'm talking about... just to moderate the 'discussion to vote' thread you kind of have to not throw in your opinion... it's a tough role, I don't think I'm the kind of person for it (so I'm not nominating myself)... I've got to be able to say my piece.<br>
<br>
Back in college in a fraternity, we had to use Rules of Order for discussions moving to a vote... believe me, even in a close knit brotherhood some amazingly heated debates can happen... not everything in a fraternity involves which sorority gets bids for mixers (those are the fun discussions)...  you have an order for discussion (not possible in a BB format since everyone posts when/what they're thinking), a period for discussion (that is possible), and a final call to question (motion for vote, also possible).<br>
<br>
Let me propose a possibility.<br>
<br>
Following off of Goats thread regarding changes in the Intention forum.  You set a timeframe for discussion (one week, two weeks, etc.).  You let all of us blowhards throw in our two cents.  Once the issues are discusses, the moderator summarizes the debate by proposing the vote.  Let folks hammer out the vote a bit then call the question.  <br>
<br>
Once the question has been called, put the thing to a vote.  EZboard supports a unique voting apparatus, of course it's by USERID so it's not exactly perfect (which could be an issue).  Allow a 10-day window for the vote, then run with the decisison as the 'will of the server.'<br>
<br>
It's up to the various guilds/independants to get the word out on a vote.  Hell, spam it in OOC if necisary and keep the vote at the top of the site like the discussion thread is right now.  <br>
<br>
When that vote is done, move to the next issue.<br>
<br>
Also, make the issues specific... the &quot;intentions yes/no&quot; is too vague (which is the very problem with it... what IS an intention?).  Here's some quick and easy topics:<br>
<br>
- deadlines for dragon raiding rights<br>
- Will Fire Giants be reservable<br>
<br>
Those should be easy topics... there will be debate, people will get pissed, but the issue on each one is pretty simple.  Baby step through the easy problems to tweak the moderating/voting system then get to the ugly issues.<br>

<br>
Disenfranchisement will bite ya in the ass 11 times out of 10.<br>
<br>
The thing is, most of the 'hot debates' on Brell are about sharing/scheduling... one thing about the way Verant designed EQ, sharing/scheduling is something you learn about really early.  The level seven playing right now in East Commons is probably having a bout with sharing at Orc2 as we discuss... <br>
<br>
Start easy with the 'should this zone/mob be' stuff... stay away from the prickly issues like guildsize and independants till the easy stuff is ironed out.  The reservation system in place functions and will carry through for a while... it's not exactly clunking out of gas just yet.<br>

<br>
Just to say a few things about voting...<br>
<br>
I will tell you upfront that I am NOT a fan of pure democratic style voting.  Why might you ask?  Because, there are many people out there that vote out of peer pressure, &quot;feeling the need to&quot; without bringing anything to the table, or just having an ignorant attitude about the problem.  I have played witness to too many instances in which people have been too blind to the other side of the story and thus vote without considering all the issues and all the facets.  <br>
<br>
Yes there are people out there that do all the things that the above people don't, but they in no way cancel each other out.  The &quot;disrupted&quot; minority will always get be the most vocal and agressively try to sway the vote in their favor, still without regard to all the facts.<br>
<br>
What do I think the best solution would be?  Simple, since the majority can't see the forest from the trees, a small group of people that can should ultimately be the decision makers.  Of course this begs the problem of &quot;who is it?&quot; and etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
Point - You're observing that Brell tends to allow bad server behavior by passivity. I actually concur with you on this one. Belial can steal an SMR and run a hate raid with experienced raiders, not planar newbies. Other situations occur where people flaunt not the system, but the community, then get to rejoin shortly afterwards. It seems like there is more benefit to screwing the system than playing by the rules (as such as we have rules). <br>
<br>
<br>
ok first it was fear<br>
second i did not sign up to go on it<br>
had no intention of going really<br>
i was asked to go<br>
also when i thought about it and asked around the person HE stole the SMR from accepted his apology and forgave him<br>
now let me say this again<br>
the person HE WRONGED signed up to go and agreed that he deserved another chance<br>
now in my book that is all that counts<br>
Belail did not steal from me he did not affect me <br>
the person he did affect accepted his apology and forgave him<br>
and another reason why i went because if Plainswalker is there and wedan and alot others then i will go if able <br>
for i respect them<br>
now if he did not steal from me or hurt me in some way<br>
who am i to continue it if the person he did wrong accepted his apology and to him all is forgoting<br>
if its thats persons wish to forgive and forget then i will do so as well<br>
i do NOT FORGIVE one that has not been forgiving by the one he wronged for they did not earn any<br>
so pls. get of it<br>
ooh another thing there is NOTHING and i mean nothing i needed in fear,<br>
i was honored enough to get my epic piece from SKYREs first fear raid after the war epic went in.<br>
i have better weapons then fear has.<br>
so i went not for GREED i went and went in late because Plains and few others i respect and love to raid with were there<br>
<br>
so pls get your facts straight<br>
as to why the rest went you will have to ask them<br>
<br>

<br>
I had posted a query as to when an apology was heartfelt, and when an issue should be considered resolved... I don't know if it was your intention, but I do think you provided a good bellweather for it... the person that he wronged had forgiven him and went along... so basically the situation should've been a dead horse at that point.<br>
<br>
At the end though, it'd be best to try to keep this thread focused on Justice's points.<br>

Allowing anyone to vote includes a lot of idiots and uninformed votes.  <br>
<br>
The thing is though, whether you agree with someones opinion or insights, if that person is affected by the outcome of the vote, now or eventually... they HAVE to have a say in it.<br>
<br>
This is the reason why a Jury of your Peers can consist of uneducated people, PhD's, etc. there may be a more qualified expert pool, but for laws or rules to touch everyone, everyone has to have a voice.<br>
<br>
The idea is creating buy in.  If people buy into a system, they tend to follow it without enforcement (Minute's point).  Even if the system doesn't always give them the best situation for them, it creates a system more preferable than many of the alternatives... It's hard to get buy in when you've got disenfrachisement built into the system.<br>
<br>
/shrug maybe there needs to be a seperate forum where each guild has one voice in it (throw in a few independant seats too).  Issues that will/should be brought up to a server vote should be discussed there.  When the 'vote' is ready, bring it out to the general public... that way you kind of get both an 'informed' conversation and a group consensus?<br>
<br>
I think the situation with the Intentions discussion resolution could have been handled a lot better if it'd been raw numbers not 'the general consensus.'  There will/is a lot of ill will created over something that a vote might have backed up anyhow... the reason that ill will has been created is because people feel like their opinion didn't matter and that there wasn't a 'consensus.'  Had a polling mechanism been used, results would have been pretty clear.  <br>
<br>
I for one disagree completely with the deletion of that forum without a clear alternative presented... however, I'd have swallowed my opinion had I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> seen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vote results...  <p><strong>Nicophorus Delphinorean,</strong><br>
