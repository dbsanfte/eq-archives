It seems like whenever someone posts a rant about being bugged constantly for buffs by rude people, etc. seomeone comes off with a smart response about &quot;you're a druid, that's your job so shut up all the whining already&quot; or something like that.  I have a 30 cleric so I know what it's like to be out there with no SOW.  It can be agonizing since she only has 72 dex she runs VERY slowly and even with sow on runs beneath many other's SOWd pace.  Still that does not give me the right to assume a druid's job is to sow me nor does it give me the right to be rude with requests like &quot;SoW plz&quot;.  I was in BB the other night and someone yelled through the entire zone &quot;heal plz&quot; three times.  No one knew where he was and he obvioiusly had a problem with demanding somoene else run to him and heal.  I sent him a tell saying, <br>
<br>
Me:  &quot;It's not a good idea to shout through the entire zone like that, no one knows were you are&quot;<br>
<br>
Him:  &quot;I'm at the crossroads&quot;<br>
<br>
I do a lookup thinking maybe he's some poor newb who is being killed and he's a 19 ranger! <br>
<br>
Me:  Oh your a 19 ranger you're not in any danger.  Do you have bind wounds?<br>
<br>
Him:  Yes but I only use that in the heat of battle I want someone to come heal me so I can keep getting xp.<br>
<br>
Me:  Well people aren't going to come running through the zone on damand when you shout &quot;heal plz&quot; don't always rely on others to make your life easier.<br>
<br>
Him:  Well you know where I am and my ranger heals suck.<br>
<br>
This is just one example.  Unless you play a druid you cannot possibly understand how many times you get these requests.  I always hear &quot;it's only 60 mana to cast SoW&quot; but typically those saying this are only seeing it from one perspective, there own.  YOUR sow may only cost me 60 mana but how aobut the 10 other requests I've had in the last thirty minutes just because I decided to make a trip to town or go to Black Burrow to work on my faction.  Even anon it doesn't stop the requests and demands from coming in.<br>
<br>
so /rant on<br>
<br>
STOP flaming druids when you don't know what you're talking about!  Get a perspective other than your own for a change!   What about those tanks who complain about casters screaming &quot;on me!!&quot; all the time.  Now that really IS their job when grouped, they don't have to face that outside of it unlike how druids are in demand 24/7.   When I'm on my cleric I remember what my druid goes through and if I truly need a sow (usually because I'm trying to get to a group and have to run through a dangerous area and I know there is no chance I can outrun anything) then I will ask **with respect** something like &quot;I'm so sorry to bother you but could you possibly cast sow on me please I'm a slow cleric and would be glad to donate what I can&quot;.  Thanks to that level of respect, I usually have no problems getting SoW when I need it and most don't accept the donation because they know I am truly in need and that I don't expect it from them.  I'm asking with courtesy and it's their peroggitive to turn me down and I would respect that as well.  If only others would do the same for my druid...<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Let the flaming begin if you like but I believe every word I've said here is absolute truth.  Respect and courtesy get you a long way in this came, try using them.<br>

<br>
typical tells go something like this 'hi, i'm sorry to intrude like this but is there any chance I could get a res? i'd be happy to pick you up and port you directly to my corpse and port you back once your finished, i'd be glad to donate for your time. thank you'<br>
<br>
The key bits to getting this to work is things like typing 'thank you' instead of thx or thanks, it just sounds more sincere, if you request like this then they will respond very pleasantly, they won't always say yes but usually something along the lines of 'sorry, i'm about to go on a planes raid' or something like that.<br>
<br>
The other key factor to getting this to work is making liberal use of the /who all command, look for 55 - 60 clerics who are in zones with a druid ring, somewhere like BB or WC is best because a level 55 - 60 isn't likely to be doing anything.<br>
<br>
A little courtesy and thought on your part can help get things done quickly.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure exactly what my post has to do with the previous one, it sort of morphed as I was thinking about it, but the gist of it is, be pleasant if you want help and your more likely to recieve, and don't sulk like a @#%$ when they turn you down =P<br>
<br>
just reply with a please 'ok, thanks for your time'<br>
<br>
hopefully they'll remember you if they see you in dire straits next time and pop you a res.<br>

I usually say something along the lines of &quot;Oh great and powerful enchantress, I beg of thee. Grant unto me the gift of clarity and I shall spread word of thy kindness across the face of Norrath.&quot; I even have several versions of that on macros just in case lol. I find I get the clarity or rezz much more often than people who say clarity me or rezz me. I seem to get those more often and faster than the people who even say please lol. So dont discount the value of going over the top when you ask for something, a lot of the time it helps!<br>

It's also about <i>where</i> you are too.<br>
<br>
When I zone in and receive a tell from a stranger asking a favour before I even receive my zoning-in message, I am less inclined to do the favour.  Yes, our names appear in /w before we actually land in the zone but it is maddening to zone in to a string of request messages that generate even before you receive the zoning message.  Posing your request very politely can nullify the annoyance factor of receiving messages before fully zoning into an area.<br>
<br>
Don't ask your would-be buffer to run to you, especially if she's an Enchantress or Cleric.<br>
<br>
When I am grouped, I am disinclined to do favours for people not in my group.  If you're grouped nearby and I'm the only one around who can give you the buffs you want, you'd better pay me and my group for the mana.  I'm willing to give SoW or Clarity, but no more than that unless adequately compensated.  Tip: 3p divided amoung a full group for three brain buffs and two body buffs that use 30% of my mana is insufficient.  Suggested donation: 3p for me, the buffer, and 1p for each additional party member.  Oh no, not 8p!  It's so much to a 45+ adventurer who's quad-kiting at KC!<br>
<br>
When I <i>offer</i> to help someone asking for help on /ooc or /shout and he then asks for more than I offer, I'm disinclined to help him.  I'm even more disinclined when he keeps me waiting for five minutes, then says that my help is appreciated but he wants me to help him later.  If you don't want a port right now, don't ask for one right now.  Ask for it when you want it.  Believe it or not, I didn't spend all those months getting to 43 just so I could sit at first torch and wait for your tardy behind.<br>
<br>
And I didn't spend all those months getting to 43 just so I could power-level your lazy behind through the first easy 15 levels of your career either.  I tell you what: I power-level you from 1 to 15 and then you log on your "uber" character and power-level me from 43 to 57.  What?  That seems unreasonable to you?  So sorry.<br>
<br>
Regarding ports and translocations, yes I know that there are some greedy Druids and Wizards out there who charge ridiculous porting and translocating fees.  Is it necessary to argue with them every single time they post their fees?  If you desperately need the port and no one else has advertised, try to politely haggle.  If the price doesn't go down, say thanks but you'll wait.  And don't call the Druid or Wizard mean names if they refuse to port you because they'd like to actually go hunting or work on tradeskills.<br>
<br>
When people spam me with requests, I'm obviously disinclined to do anything other than type /ignore [ idiot's name here ].<br>
<br>
When people ask for a buff using "U" and "plz" I'm disinclined to help.  Yes, it's anal retentive, but I am a roleplayer.  You don't have to bow or kiss my feet, and you need not call me "m'lady," but it won't break your fingers to type out "you" and "please."  I make exceptions towards "sow" and "crack" and "speed", and I think that's reasonably generous.  However, as Dobban notes, going over the top does help--it might get you Skin like Diamond + Strength of Stone or Gift of Magic + Intellectual Superiority + Augmentation + Radiant Visage + Obscure.<br>
<br>
Although I have a history of refusing a lot of donations, I will accept them at times; offering a donation (whether I accept them or not) can earn you a place in my List of People to Help Whenever Possible.  I expect that other people feel much the same way about this.<br>
<br>
All the people who do these other things usually end up on /ignore or my List of People to Never Help.<br>
<br>
And, one last thing, even if you don't roleplay I'd ask that you respect the fact that I do Mr. Evil I Want Buffs.  I'm a Fair Elf.  I abhor undead and evil.  I reserve the right to take offense to your evil god, your slaying of innocent and otherwise peaceful creatures (whether they give faction hits or not), your class, and your behaviour.  You reserve the right to take offense to anything about me.  I ask only that you don't start /shouting that I'm every kind of blankety-blank just because I won't track for you, or buff, heal, or port you.<br>
<br>
And please don't waste my time or yours explaining how /role works; it hides your class and level and race, but shows your guild if you have one.  It's generally used by Druids and Wizards to avoid "please port/tl me" and serves absolutely no purpose other than to go anonymous while still displaying your guild affiliation.  Typing /role does not make you a roleplayer and there is no law that says roleplayers must use it.  Don't waste our time telling me to go to the Firiona Vie server either; it didn't exist when my chars were "born" and I have community ties where I am.<br>

I spent a couple hours yesterday in Shadowweavers just doing drive by buffing. Some folks may have saw me at the banker, I would sit, chat in guildsay and folks that came in hurt got regen, everyone got sow.<br>
<br>
What frosts my arse is when I log in, or land at a ring, and immediatly get sent DIRECT TELLS asking for ports. <br>
<br>

Welcome to West Commondlands..<br>
Sosandso tells you  &quot;Hello&quot; &lt;--- very first message in my chat bar.<br>
You tell Soandso &quot;Hello Sir. Good morning.&quot;<br>
(every Druid here KNOWS what the next line was)<br>
<br>
Long story short, I was late for a Raid in Kith and did not port him to GD, but memmed Misty Thicket and got moving...<br>
<br>
Welcome to Misty Thicket..<br>
SoandSo01 tell you &quot;Good morning&quot;<br>
You tell Soandso01 &quot;Hello Sir. Good morning.&quot;<br>
SosanSo01 tells you &quot;Can you port me to Freerott?&quot;<br>
(GAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!)<br>
<br>
GDI just OOC it, if I am busy, I will not answer, if I am free I WILL respond. Just don't press me with a tell to respond. After almost 40 levels, I finally broke down and went /role because I just got tired of having to explain to people why I did not have the time AT THAT MOMENT to port them. <br>
<br>
I also gave up my +wis 1HB in lieu of a Ice War Claw 1HS with no stats. And, when at all possible I wield a Parrying Dagger in my offhand. Now I look like a Ranger.<br>
<br>
Oh and before anyone starts with the &quot;but you don't know what it's like to be a (insert non-porting class name here)&quot; reply, look at my sig and what my main is. ;) Trust me I do know.<br>
<br>
And you know who ruined my kind hearthedness? Those non-porting class people who send me direct tells before my screen even draws, then when I did have time to port them from WC to DL, before I zone in, they are already half way to the tunell and give me the &quot;K, tnx, l8r bye!&quot; and disband.
