Every major guild on Brell was represented at the meeting of the minds.  People unanimously wanted to keep reservations on Hate &amp; Fear.  Opinions were mixed on the rotation list type mobs, and reservations that have become trivial for most(FG's).<br>
<br>
Some people prefer FCFS for a lot of stuff.  Ie: All of velious.  If the people that kill Zland, Kland, the Dain, etc, prefer FCFS, cool for them.  They're the ones killing them, they can decide what they want.  I don't think it's appropriate for the people that aren't killing something to go &amp; say, &quot;You guys need to setup a rotation on the Dain.&quot;  They've never even seen the Dain.<br>
<br>
You've said it one way.  I think a better way to say it is:<br>
<br>
A lot of people prefer FCFS, but are willing to accept reservations on other things, if that's what the community wants.  The people killing Dain etc, have decided not to institute a reservation system, but they will still continue to respect what exists as reserved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 699<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/27/01 10:25:25 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FFA vs FCFS ve Reservations</span><hr size=1> <br>
Reservations are not always the answer.  If there is a particular mob you feel you're not getting a fair shot at send a tell in-game to the people that are killing it and ask for a shot at it.<br>
<br>
If you want to kill the Dain/Klandicar/Zlandicar send a tell.  If you are successful you shouldn't have a problem rotating with the other people killing them.  Work it out in-game.  Communicate.<br>

Sheeb, forgive me if i am wrong,  But i recall seeing a post within the last week (searched, but might have been deleted) where a fear raider thanked Abyss for sending a couple of groups in to help finish clearing fear and taking out draco.  Isnt this the same thing?  By Ang's definition, weren't you  *stealing* Draco from the next few raids.  The original raiders groups couldnt handle it, so you guys sent in a force and wiped him out.<br>
<br>
The last 2 times we killed cazic were....<br>
(1) on a scheduled SR raid last friday<br>
(2) on a unreserved fear day after a raid had done all they could on monday.<br>
<br>
Since the early days of the planes, if a raid couldnt handle what was left as the day got later, they called in extra groups.  I used to love coming to help as part of what i used to call a *god squad*.  As long as its not done without the raids consent, i dont see a problem with it.  Its not like we zoned in between raids and took the 2nd floor of hate or anything.<br>

So tell me something we don't all know. When people get over this &quot;We are pure as the driven snow&quot; mentality, and start understanding that everyone has interests, we might be able to come to a compromise that has something in it for everyone.

I know enshadowed has a calender of events, I would expect most of the large, if not all the guilds have something similar.  What if the big guilds went ahead and scheduled what they wanted to do, posted their schedules publicly, and those that wanted to adhere to reservations could still do so... just not making reservations for areas/mobs that the big guilds already had calendered.  This would serve a few purposes... the big guilds can work at their own pace... the small guilds could still do scheduling.  The benefit is that it will likely get the big guilds out of areas that have been traditionally reserved areas quicker, mobs will not be wasted and potentially a greater number of areas could conceivably become reserved areas... as long as people understood the big guilds were not as much part of it.  No, it does not treat every person and guild equally, but not every person or guild plays the same amount.  Some mobs would still be an issue... VS, Trak but I still think that the big guilds will have less and less need of these mobs in the long run (thereby allowing greater reserving of these mobs by the rest of the brell populace) than under the previous reservation system.  It would require that the guilds post their calender and make great efforts to adhere to it, but most of the time that occurs anyway. <br>

<br>
Furthermore, most &quot;large guild&quot; raid calendars include materials from the existing scheduled reservation system.  I know for a fact Watchers doesn't put Hate on their calendar until it's been properly reserved on the Brellserilis.net calendar.<br>

Your suggestion, Syrillan, is a nice one, but won't happen.  Who determines when a guild has reached &quot;large guild&quot; status to &quot;ignore&quot; the current reservation and post their public raid?<br>

<br>
     Deciding who would fall into that catagory wouldn't be too tough, you could either make it a number of guildmembers with a certain average level (say 40 guildmembers of 55th level) or use something similar to what other servers do to add people to a mob rotation list... say..Take down CT with 75% of the listed people being from the guild in question.   In any case, is not the concept in theory a good match of the two? I know Enshadowed has a raid signup area where we list exactly what days we want to do what planes or mobs.  We similarly have xp days.  If SR, Enshadowed, Watchers and ET all listed their calenders, then the rest of brell could schedule after.  I mean heck, I bet if you added up all the truly calandered plane/mob events from those 4 guilds over a two week period... it would have almost no impact on the current reservation system, yet allow those guilds to not be inhibited by it as well.  Again, I am just trying to come up with an idea that would strike a balance for both the reservation folks and the fcfs people.<br>
