</td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !!</span><hr size=1> Everyone, I talked with some people today today and found that it wasn't the fact that they were taken away it was the fact that the only way people felt they could voice their opnions on the matter at the time was the poll and we said the poll wasn't binding.  So some people feel that the poll was misleading and was the reason they were taken away.  <br>
<br>
I can understand how some people would see it that way and I apologize.  Long before this poll was made I questioned the validity of the FG reservation in the Mod section of this board.  I gave my reasons then for my feelings and was asked to not make a judgement until later. But then polls were made in General that would have only caused more problems and so Jaradis made this series of polls.  I used this poll to help prove the point that I had made earlier in the Mods section and got the other mods to agree with me that action should be taken.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if you all feel I jumped the gun in doing this, and I am sorry if you feel that your right to choose what was reservable and what was not was taken away.  I am also sorry if you all feel mislead by the fact that I used the poll to help prove a point.  I never meant to make anyone feel like their trust in my actions as a mod is misplaced.<br>
<br>
I only have the greatest respect for this board and the reservation system, that is why I wanted the Fire Giants removed.  If things stay on the system &quot;just because they have always been there&quot; then they will lead the system into a complete failure.  When mobs were put onto a reservation  system they were never voted on to be added (barring FG's I think they are the only one that this was not the case with) so I didn't see why, when they were not being utilized, we needed a vote to prove that the system was broken in their case.<br>
<br>
The reason no one knew in public what my feelings were is that I support the system completely, and feel that when changes need to be made the first place they should be discussed is between the Mods.  If I came to an open forum and said that the reservation system is broken a lot of people would read things into my words that are untrue.  I support any decsion made on these boards concerning the reservations, or any other change.  Even if I do not agree with them, I will support them as a Moderator.  <br>
<br>
Again I apologize for anyone's misunderstanding of what happened.  If anyone would like to talk to me on this issue you can email me at kestrithebard@hotmail.com and I would be happy to discuss my findings and the reasons I felt that the system was failing in respect to the Fire giant reservation system.<br>
<br>
Now, enough rambling for the night!  <br>

Someone said this was based on 227 votes for them to be fcfs...considering I used to see Brell have 2400 players online, yes that is the majority. <br>

Can't wait for the day when I can zone to a plane with a group and piss off people under the holy name of FCFS.<br>

Perhaps instead of taking it from everyone who has a few lvl 60 chars, you should ask the people affected by this and make these votes known to the server and not just the people who check the board every day to gossip with friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umysticalogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mystical Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Phatty Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 438<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/6/02 12:06:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisfrm71.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://picturesofjunk.homestead.com/files/OglyFace.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmm...</span><hr size=1> People worry too much about singular parties dominating the reserved spawns.<br>

Nagafen/Vox: The high end guilds have no use for these dragons, considering they are all above 52, and can access Talendor and Gorenaire much easier, as well as Servilious and Faydedar.<br>
<br>
Fear/Hate: Once again, except for epic components and rarely gods, (Innoruuk is never killed, Cazic sometimes stays up for nice periods of time) uberguilds have very little reason to come here. Yeah, maybe the golems and Dracoliche, but really, many different raids can kill them, so it would be about as important as, say, the named symbol dropping drakes in the Halls of Testing -- which by the way, no-one cares about enough to want to reserve! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and you can get MUCH better armor on a Kael Raid. Most planar capable guilds are perfectly capable of putting together Kael Arena raids, which not only have much better stats, but drop for all classes over the class-specific planes. Same with the Plane of Growth, which is intolerably underused!<br>
<br>
Trakanon: Venril Sathir is FCFS, and how many times has an ubreguild gone to take him out? Not many, and Trakanon would probably follow suite. Face it, Veeshan's Peak is a weak zone (lots of effort for very little), so it's not like there is a high demand to get a whole guild outfitted in VP keys. I'm sure there has been under 5 raids total to that zone since the zone went live. /shrug<br>
<br>
Sky: Extremely underused as it is, reservations here really don't seem to matter, since they are hardly ever bothered with. Removing them would do absolutely nothing in general, except make it easier for the rare raids to actually go up.<br>
<br>
Yes, this post supports FCFS, they are my opinions and I stand by them. This is not meant to become a rant, but is instead discussion-based.<br>

<br>
FG's seem to be working well on FCFS.<br>
<br>
Nag/Vox: I disagree on the high end guilds not wanting access to CoF/RBBs.  In total I think the reservations as they stand work fairly well here and see no vast need to change them.  The few weeks of FCFS showed that (for Vox at least) the FCFS system results in many more failures when compared to an organized signup raid.  Because of the level limits here I see very little reason to change a system that works at the moment.<br>
<br>
Trak: /shrug.  I see both arguments.  Making him FCFS probably would create a few more rants but I'm not too bothered.  Comparing him to VS is a little bit of a stretch though.  A Trak raid is a lot different to a VS raid and requires more organization.<br>
<br>
Fear/Hate: Reservations only apply to armor mobs.  Arguments about the other mobs is pointless.  I see it more as a courtesy thing than anything else.  Is raiding Fear/Hate more than once a fortnight that upsetting for you?<br>
<br>
Sky: Reservations are important here to make sure the key mobs are up.  Not having keys can really screw your raid up.<br>
<br>
Sure, I support the status quo but only because there's so much more out there to raid that I really don't get my knickers in a knot over it.  It's uncomfortable and gives me piles.<br>

I should have been more precise in blowing off the comment.<br>
<br>
What I really meant to say was that the line about guilds wanting a CoF or RBB was a minor point and shouldn't be taken as the cornerstone of my argument.  I got it wrong, and please excuse me for that.  I really wasn't trying to insinuate that the larger guilds would &quot;oppress the weak&quot; or anything as paranoid or delusional as that.  The only haste number I really know a lot about is 65% (what Burnout IV gives my pet) and I'll figure out Muzzle of Mardu sometime soon.<br>
<br>
For Vox and Nag I've always seen the benefit of the rotation as giving the people less experienced in raiding some sort of system where they can be introduced to the systems of what buffs they'll need, who's in command, what classes are required and the like in a more formal way rather than just throwing them in the deep end.  For Vox at least this does seem to lead to more successful raids and less dragons being &quot;wasted&quot;.<br>
<br>
As pointed out, high end guilds don't actually need these dragons and can't take them anyway due to the level limit so the reservations really act as more of a &quot;shallow end of the pool&quot; for the 48-52 group.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, seeing I've levelled beyond that, I don't know why I still care enough to post out my thoughts.  It's much more fun raiding dragons FCFS now that I've been introduced through Nag and Vox and have half a clue what's going on.<br>
<br>
Of course, now I get to see what the true oppression of SR/W/LoH/E is on the high end mobs.  (JK!!!!)<br>
