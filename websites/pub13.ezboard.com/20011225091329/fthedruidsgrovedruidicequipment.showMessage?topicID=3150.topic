<br>
Over the levels, I've aquired some decent gear to give me 200 wis, and an extra +200 or more Mana:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Forest Loops, Velium Ruby Veil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Sapphire Platinum Necklace, Platinum Tiara,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Velium Jasper Rings, 2 Withered Leather Wristbands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withered Leather Arms, Withered Leather Gloves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braided Ivy Cords, Mithril Runed Tunic,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mammoth Hide Cloak, High Quality Blood Wolf Harness, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gatorscale Leggings, GEB's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark Ember, Book of Obolus, Frozen Orb<br>
<br>
Now that I'm 52, I'm starting to go on raids, but I'm somewhat inexperienced (having quad kited most of my life). Even though the above items were very time and money consuming to get, most don't give me any Saves.<br>
<br>
Some folks tell me, for raids, you should have a minimum of 70 on your Fire, Cold and Magic resists *Unbuffed*. Is that an accurate number?<br>
<br>
So, I'm trying to get some items to switch out during raids. I've only bought these so far:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crown of Froglok Kings (20 Fire, 20 Cold)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Diamond Platinum Wedding Rings (+7 to all, each)<br>
<br>
With those 3, my Magic is 44, Fire is 81 and Cold is 74, (Wis down to 186). Since I've also been told Wis isn't so important on raids, and my Magic is still low, I'm planning on getting the following also:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Hollowed Bone Bracers (+7 Magic, each)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Earring of Magic Reflection (+5 Magic, each)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Gold Necklace (+7 Magic, Fire and Cold)<br>
<br>
Which will bring my unbuffed Magic to 75, Fire 88 and Cold 81 but drop my Wis down to 170. <br>
<br>
Is that a good place to be? Is the loss of 30 wis (312 mana @ 52), worth the extra 31 Magic protection? Can anyone suggest different items, for better stats?<br>
<br>
Advice from experienced druid raiders very appreciated!!<br>
(Blue Diamonds are too expensive/rare at the moment, so please only realistic suggestions :)<br>
<br>
Thanks! (Woof),<br>

<br>
<br>
Goto Temple of Droga and get the earring of essence (+10 sv magic). Also while there do yourself a favour and get the Shroud of Nature.(bring a friend like a tank..you will clear out all the spawns fast and get a shroud in 2-3 hours if lucky. I got 3 in about 6-7 hours, one for me and gave one to a friend and the third rotted...DOH!). The shroud is 13 ac 6 wis 7sv cold/fire/magic...and much better than the RMT in my opinion.<br>
<br>
[EDIT:- correction SoN is not Magic resist as someone pointed out...I was operating from memory and got it wrong....it is 13ac 6 wis 8fr 8cr :) ]<br>
<br>
Also do the locked run quest thingie...that is a nice necklace with resists and mana.<br>
<br>
Finially get a mistmore shield, nice resists on that one too. (or of course you can the book of rings, 8wis 10FR CR and swap out other slots instead).<br>
<br>
Personally If I am going on a raid where resists are important, I have no problem dropping my wis from 200+ down to 140ish. On a raid you will have crack and the mana pool s not half as important as staying alive to keep the tanks alive. More often than not you will not have a bard in your group so you need to get your resists as high as possible. Currently in our guild we have to have a min of 120 resist for all for the serious raids....and quite a few people over shoot this by a lot.<br>
<br>
Don't get hung up on resist gear...but there is LOTS of there that is good solid gear that is cheap to get....but your wis will suck. So unless you are a serious power gamer don;t worry about it...get resists up about the 80 mark and have fun.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what targets you are after, but don't wait till the last minute to start on you DR and PR also...My best advice is to start getting any all items that have good resists on them and store them on a mule in RV. When the time comes about for a raid you will be happy you got the resist stuff together nice and early!! you can then also play with the combinations and find what is best for you.<br>
<br>
Also, don;t forget for a raid, you only need your resist gear for the encounter. Wear your normal stuff for the 2-3 hours needed before hand to get to the target(eg clearing the FG's, IG's or whatever)..then Before the buffing start put on your gear.<br>
<br>
hope that helps :)<br>

<br>
Also, a commonly used figure for minimum resistance is 100 unbuffed. Below that, you are taking some risks (or not, depending on the mob).<br>

I use mainly velium blue diamonds stuff, along with some dropped-off mobs gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukatlynel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katlynel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/27/01 9:20:00 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.asianavenue.com/indiegrrl/faedrake.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Resistance Gear - How much Save/Wis is Safe?</span><hr size=1> Good luck getting earrings of magic reflection, they're pretty rare and I don't think I've ever seen one auctioned.  (They're only gotten as a random reward off that Nilipuss quest.)<br>
<br>
Correction, the shroud of nature does *not* have 7svmagic ... only fire/cold.  A few other decent resist items include spectral shroud (back slot, 5 svmagic), symbol of loyalty to Vox (wrist 7svcold), and diamond resist mask (gold is 10fire/cold 5poison/dis, electrum is 5fire/cold 10poison/dis ... I went with electrum).  There's also the supple scale armband that drops (nodrop) off the Karnor's drolvarg warlord, though of course that would require you to actually group (gasp!) to get it.<br>
<br>
Also I'd consider going for pure MR in neck slot and one of the finger slots, I use a plat jacinth ring and plat wolf's eye agate necklace.  This is because MR items are so much rarer than other resists ... i.e., I can get other resists in many more item slots than i can get MR, so getting MR where I can get it is really important. <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

I'm wearing a lot of other withered, and each piece cost me exactly 1k, so I hope to pick some shoulders up for that or less.<br>
<br>
My Mammoth Hide Cloak gives Sv cold +5, and since I can't find any other nice black for my budget, I'm not going to replace it.<br>

Belt, I haven't found any with +resists. If anyone knows of a good belt piece, please post your reccomendations. :)<br>

The Locked Rum quest suggestion, which I found starts in Iceclad and yields a chain necklace, doesn't have stats as good as a player made necklace or even a White Gold necklace. So I'm going to try for one of the later two.<br>

Kunzar Cloak (+10svfire ac7 wis2) also 1-200ppish<br>
Mammoth Hide Cloak (+5svcold ac7 wis4)<br>
I also have a cloak of the icebear (20svcold) that I rarely wear.<br>
<br>
Waist slot, there's very little ... splitpaw or gnome skin belt are +5svpoison, but other than that your only real option is the silverleaf girdle that drops in Hate (like 20MR) or else a tailored cobalt drake hide belt which is super hard to make and has a few sv cold points on it.<br>
<br>
Shoulders I use my obulus death shroud, it's +1 to all saves and its other stats are so good that I think it's worth keeping on.<br>
<br>
But in general, magic resist is very simply a pain in the arse to get, it's the hardest of all the resists to increase (MR items are the rarest and hardest to get), as well as the most useful of all the resists to have.  And therefore magic resist items are generally very expensive. <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

However, to get decent resists you are going to need some items with good wisdom and resists.  Some easy Velious items to get for wisdom and resists are the Seal of Thoradin 3 ac 3 wis 30 mana 3 cold/magic resist ranged slot item (thurgadin quest), Kromnif Military Leggings 14 ac 6 wis and 5 cold/disease resist legs, and finally coldain military wristguard 10 ac 5 wis and 5 magic/5 cold resist.  Both the Kromnif military leggings and the wristguard can be multiquested with a friend who is allied with those factions.  Those quests can all be done solo but best to find a partner to help kill the end creature for leggings/wristguard.  A non-quest item to get for wisdom/resists in Velious is the wedding band 2 ac 5 wis 15 mana 8 fire/cold resist - it is found by killing the groom on the 5th floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow (easily soloable).<br>
<br>
BTW, Hollowed Bone Bracer is arms not a bracer - go figure ;p.  If possible, try going on a few fear raids - the vermiculated arms are a VERY common drop and 7 magic resist/other stats (I am still wearing vermiculated arms, heh).  If you are incredibly lucky, you can get a vermiculated bracer with 8 fire/cold resist (I still havent gotten one after 10 million fear/hate raids ;p).  Also, a vermiculated tunic is very nice cause it has 13 wisdom which means you can forgo wisdom in alot of other areas.<br>
<br>
Some alternative bracers to vermiculated with resists include supple scale which drops off warlord in KC - 3 ac 5 wis 10 fire resist 15 mana, and bracer of vejaan 10 ac 10 fire/cold resist (no wisdom) - drops in Temple of Drogga from the same mob that drops the earring of essence (10 magic resist 30 hp earring) - go there to get the earring and hope you get lucky with bracer of vejaan cause it is really rare drop.  Probably alot easier just to buy the bracer of vejaaan ;p. <p>Fayne Dethe<BR>

 Lets not forget a few pieces of resist gear<br>
 <br>
 Gladiator Chain Leggings - Legs have +10MR<br>
 Gladiator Arms - Arms are +2 all saves cept magic which<br>
 is +3.<br>
<br>
 Basically, as a druid, FR/CR should be pretty easy to<br>
 find since most of the items druids can wear have FR/CR<br>
 on them (go figure). With my normal equipment I have<br>
 102FR/98CR and I don't have any blue diamond jewelry.<br>
 My PR/DR are both in the 40's and MR is 51 so you could<br>
 say they all more or less stink but can be raised. You<br>
 can pick up little pieces of jewelcrafted resist gear<br>
 to swap out for particular raid types (for typical dragons<br>
 you need MR + whatever the dragon's breath is...MR is<br>
 almost more important since you don't want to die while<br>
 running to and fro from the dragon fear). As for trashing<br>
 wis, I have 212 wis at the moment (yes, I need to find<br>
 something better than what I have to swap out and get<br>
 back down to 200 ish) and when I swap out resist gear I<br>
 normally drop down to about 150s or 160s. I've never had<br>
 a mana shortage. I'm either dead or the mob drops so fast<br>
 I've done some DD, if I know I can stick them, or I've<br>
 healed whatever char the mob was beating on. When I first<br>
 went on a dragon raid I was ignorant of much of the resist<br>
 gear and I dropped like a stone in water. My 200+ wis did<br>
 me a world of good when I dropped 10 seconds into combat.<br>

Strange as it may seem, they are for ARM, not your wrist, so you would only be able to use one of them.  They are good to have, especially on the PvP servers.  I guess that's one advantage of PvP servers.  By the time you get ready to go on plane raids, you have lots of resist armor usually! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeoni.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peoni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/2/01 6:11:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raid Resistance Gear - How much Save/Wis is Safe?</span><hr size=1> For raid mobs like Vox/Nagafen at lvl 52 you will get by fine with a base 70-80MR and 100FR or CR (unbuffed)<br>
<br>
Against Kunark Dragons when you reach a level that you can really take part, that number rises drastically where 150+MR CR or FR (unbuffed) is a good target to aim for.<br>
<br>
As for resist items<br>
Froglok Crown 20FR/CR or tranix crown 20MR (Lguk/Solb)<br>
Earring of essence 10MR (Droga temple - quite easy to obtain)<br>
Gold Diamond Mask 10FR/CR 5PR/DR 3MR (Jewelcraft)<br>
Blue Diamond earrings (11PR/DR 6FR/CR 4MR) are also very good resist items (jewelcraft)<br>
White Gold Necklace 7FR/CR/MR (Lguk)<br>
Wurm Scale Coat 20FR 10MR (shoulders) from Burning Woods<br>
Verm Bracers - very good wisdom item and 7FR/CR with some mana (Plane of fear)<br>
Coldain military bracer (again good wisdom and AC - with 5MR/CR) - velius quests<br>
Blue diamond bracer +9FR/MR/DR/PR +11CR - jewelcraft<br>
Platinum/Velium Diamond rings (+7 or +8 all resists) - jewelcraft<br>
Verm Arms or Hollowed Bone Bracers (7MR) Plane of Fear/Najena <br>
Withered leather arms (4wisdom 10FR) - the hole<br>
Drakescale belt 10FR - (sol a) Silverleaf Girdle (20MR and +wisdom - Plane of hate)<br>
Shroud of Nature (6wisdom 8FR/CR) - Temple of Droga<br>
Cloak of ice bear (20CR), Kunzar Cloak (10FR 2wis - KC) - or when you drop lucky - Lodizal Shield (20FR/CR 10MR +10wis and 23ac - cobalt scar quest)<br>
Verm Legs (5wis 7PR - plane of fear) or Gladiator Chain (wis +MR - kael)<br>
<br>
I've never worn +resist boots, and i'm not aware of a resist pair of gloves that i'd change out for my coldain gloves - i did wear verm before tho for 7DR...<br>
<br>
The main problem you will face is a wis vs resist trade off, and as items that have both are very highly sought after, you will normally face alot of competition to obtain them, with that said tho, if your on a raid where you require resists - go with resists. <br>
<br>
It is afterall better for you to run OOM on a raid than to spend the entire fight feared or having to heal yourself from dragon fear/breath weapon.....<br>

<br>
AC:12, WIS:6, SVMag:5<br>
<br>
I use all the time now (no dragon or planar shield yet) and find the SvMag comes in very handy, even in places like Seb where gravity flux seems to be like the plague :)<br>
