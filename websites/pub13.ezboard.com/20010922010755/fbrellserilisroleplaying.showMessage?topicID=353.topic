But the strongest lesson she learned was the day she confronted a minion of Fear.<br>
<br>
Mischief was a guild in which many races and callings came together to form a strong alliance of friends.  But one day a new member entered their ranks, he was an Erudite named Flayh.  Instantly he began talking of his dark powers and how he was unleashing them on the creatures that lived outside his home of Paineel in the land of Odus.  He spoke of calling his God Cazic Thule to guide his hand in striking Fear into the hearts of his enemies.  Kestri was taken aback, she trusted the judgment of her friends in Mischief, but this evil one seemed so out of the realm of her understanding.  Listening to him speak rocked her to the core of her being and sent fear weaving into her soul.<br>
<br>
A few days later Flayh was hunting in the lands known as the Oasis as Kestri entered them.  Instantly he asked her to join him, as he would appreciate the company.  Remembering how the dark powers sought her out in Freeport she was wary.  But an old adage entered her mind.  “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” She said to herself.  And she moved across the sand and helped him destroy the cold-blooded beasts that hunted down travelers on the beaches there.<br>
<br>
She talked to him never letting him know he affected her and found that they hunted well together.  They talked of the skills and powers he was given and her dreams of reaching the time in the land when she could make a name for herself in the world.  Flayh had a great interest in the effect of her songs on his prowess in battle and challenged her to find new ways to help them work better together.  All in all the time they spent was a success, but her heart never let go of the fear and she never trusted him completely.<br>
<br>
Over the course of her hunting from Oasis to High Hold to Lake Rathe they would meet again and hunt together.  But even as her admiration for him grew, she could not let go of the fact that his God was searching her out to use for his own amusement someday.<br>

<br>
Memories are the only things that last forever. Friendships break apart, and quite easily at that. Trust, Honesty and a genuine love is what builds a strong friendship. When any of these elements are removed, the friendship is torn apart and lost.<br>
<br>
If you make a friend you wish to keep, then make sure you view yourself and what you do with them from thier perspective. Many times troubles are caused by simple misunderstandings, and sadly, sometimes even the strongest of friendships deteriorate from those simple misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
Hold close to your heart those you wish to stay there. Treat them as though it were your last day with them. Make sure they know you still consider them a friend of yours. Give them the benefit of the doubt when suspicions arise. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Make sure those memories you make with them will be good ones, and not the ones I have with me now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=359.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=358.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=353.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=353.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=353.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm67">Today's News<option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">Rants Link<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (Buying Only)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Sales and Trades)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
