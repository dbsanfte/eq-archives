BlackSnow Interactive (BSI) is a group of individuals that play, buy, and sell in various Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). Growing from only one person nearly two years ago, to seven full-time people, this group has successfully developed a market in which they are able to supply players with gaming currency, items, or characters at competitive prices. Mythic wants BSI to cease all sales immediately. <br><br>After entering the DAoC market, shortly after its release, BSI created a website and began listing their sales on various auction sites, such as Ebay. BSI’s Director of Sales, Lee Caldwell, was quoted as saying, “What it comes down to is, does a MMORPG player have rights to his time, or does Mythic own that player’s time? It is unfair of Mythic to stop those who wish to sell their items, currency or even their own accounts, which were created with their own time. Mythic, in my opinion, and hopefully the court’s, does not have the copyright ownership to regulate what a player does with his or her own time or to determine how much that time is worth on the free market.“ <br><br>Caldwell goes on to say, “Mythic’s attempt to stifle competition in their own game makes it possible for only full-time gamers to succeed in the game and most MMORPG players can’t compete on that level. The person that plays just a few hours a week, can’t put in the time required to build their character or collect the items needed to join others in the online battles. No one has stood up to any of these software giants, until now.” <br><br>If you would like to take a look at the actual court document, please visit www.camelotexchange.com. </b> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A> at: 2/7/02 7:24:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/7/02 10:26:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Have at it hon!

No one is selling "goods" or "items."  Not even arguably so, as there aren't any goods or items to be sold in the first place.  I trust we all agree that there is no tangible item called "Sword of Dorf Bashing," correct?  No one buying the Sword of Dorf Bashing on ebay can take it home and put it above the mantel. <br><br>Instead, what is being sold at the concrete level are "access rights."  At a more abstract level, what is being sold are "services," which really boils down to the time (and skill) of the person providing the services.<br><br>When you sell an account, what are you selling?  The right to access that account, and all the rights and privileges that that account has. Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>When you sell a piece of equipment or money, what are you selling?  The right to access or use the collection of data that make up that particular item or amount of money.  You are transferring that right from one account to another.<br><br>The mechanism...and the legal ramifications of the transfer vis a vis copyright law...are exactly the same regardless of whether the consideration involved is gold, plat, another "item," dollars, or eleemosynary intent.   If it is a violation of copyright law for me to sell you Item X in the game for dollars, it is a violation of copyright law for me to sell you Item X for platinum.<br><br>Of course, in my opinion there is no violation of copyright law.  Nothing is being copied.  Everything that started in the game world remains inside the game world.  Everything that was subject to the ultimate control of Verant/Mythic/whoever is still subject to that ultimate control.  No copyright violation here.<br><br>Even if you assume that Item X is a copyrighted item, selling your copy of it on ebay is not a violation of copyright law.  Books, CDs, records, etc., all are copyrighted items, yet if you are the legitimate owner of a copy of that item, you are permitted to sell your copy, even if you make a profit.   You just cannot make copies of your copy and sell those.  <br><br>They aren't selling personal property.  They're either selling (1) access rights, or (2) time/services.  Thus, the ultimate question is whether two players should be able to bargain between themselves for the sale of services, time, or access rights relating to a game world.  It's more an issue of contract law (including tortious interference with contract and business relationships) than copyright law.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uericfate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EricFate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/10/02 7:22:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I guess that's the key.</span><hr size=1> I don't consider virtual property to be in any way equivocal to personal property.

In that context by agreeing to the EULA do you contract not to engage in the sale of in game items for real world money? and is that enforceable? (either in the context of the entire EULA or that specific contract provision) <br><br>Having said that, and with the big disclaimer that I do not practice intellectual property, there are intellectual property rights that can exist despite the fact that nothing is further &quot;copied&quot; so to speak.  For instance, a play.  If I were to perform a play and I intend to charge the audience for the performance, I must pay some amount to the rights holder or I violate the copyright.  In my example, the work has already been published and I have paid for my copy of the play.  It would be mine and the casts time and effort to put on the play, but still there are intellectual property rights that must be protected.  I will be the first to admit, that these two situations are not entirely analogous, but if I were researching this area of law, I would be sure to look here for some precedent. <br><br>I have not followed too much how Verant currently handles that situation, but if it is similar to Mythic, then I am a bit surprised they were not included in the suit (a much bigger fish to fry there)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/11/02 10:36:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/zidane.gif WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=64></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> Well, the fact is they're not suing under Contract Law, but Copyright Law.<br><br>For those who actually enjoy perusing legal documents, BSI have all 11 pages of the lawsuit posted on their site here:<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.camelotexchange.com/Lawsuit.asp">www.camelotexchange.com/Lawsuit.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>I'm still chuckling at the fact that people actually made a business out of selling abstract MMORPG materials. heh...next thing you know they'll be auctioning their babies' dirty diapers on ebay. =P <p><A HREF="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=9442&raceid=1&classid=25"><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/NyssaSignatures/NyssaScale.jpg" ALT="Click to see character stats."

At least to me.  I have an extremely stupid amount of /played in EQ.  Looking back, I could have done something a lot more productive.  Yet, I do not regret the &quot;good times&quot; of EQ where we did &quot;fun&quot; things.  That's what entertainment is about.<br><br>There are always certain aspects of games that are less fun for some folks than others.  For me, grinding sucks wind.  If I can kill a mob once, the challenge is pretty much gone.  If I can learn how to earn 1 GP, there's little further challenge to figuring out how to do so.  Grinding to GET to the fun parts is to me an unnecessary burden for entertainment...especially computer based entertainment.<br><br>Yes, yes, there is value in being persistent in the pursuit of goals...in the real world.  Burning time to simply burn time in a MMORPG is, well, IMHO silly.<br><br>So, if someone wants to pay these folks to kill a billion greens to get a plat for $100 they've saved dozens of hours.  Likewise if you bought a lvl 50 character you save hundreds of hours of /played.  You then get to enjoy the &quot;fun&quot; part of DAoC...RvR.  <br><br>You'll suck at it but at least every hour spent on the game goes toward learning how to play your class...and not grinding xp until you're blue in the face.  <br><br>I would pay Mythic $200 (about 1 years subscription) to get a lvl 50 character.  They don't sell this option.  Their loss...doubled since I just cancelled DAoC.  <br><br>That's the real way to solve this problem.  Sell equipment and levels for real dollars and tag characters as &quot;BUFFED&quot; or stick em on some different server or something.

While I can appreciate the option to do so, but folks, keep in mind this is a game.  A game is something you do for leisure and during your free time.  If you don't have the free time to persue the game, what would buying a 50th lvl character do for you anyways?  What would you do with it? Would you even know how to play it properly?  Many people fail to realize that MMORPG involves strategy, not only on the individual level but on a group level as well.  <br><br>Sure xp grinding is boring and tedious, but that's similar to schooling when you were young.  If scientists discovered with a way for mothers to birth children who are already full grown would you choose that option?  Heck, no growing pains, teenage years, etc, I know a lot of parents would go for that, but will the child be able to survive?  <br><br>I'm veering way off track here.  I don't care to have a discussion about ethics. The point is, Americans have it way too easy when it comes to lawsuits.  Hundreds, if not thousands of frivilous lawsuits gets filed and tossed around each day.  I just think that the idea of having a business just to sell intangible items off a MMORPG is just down right silly.  Am I against it?  Am I siding with Mythic in saying down with the ebayers?  No, not at all.  My personal opinion for what it's worth, is that it is just silly.  <br><br>We are a frivilous society.  There are absurd listings on ebay on a daily basis.  But somewhere, some how, people will buy it.  Would you be surprised if someone listed their baby's dirty diaper on ebay, and call it...dare I say it, art? ;) <p><A HREF="http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm?template=9442&raceid=1&classid=25"><IMG SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/NyssaSignatures/NyssaScale.jpg" ALT="Click to see character stats."

In EQ a lvl 60 character has lots to do (raid).  <br><br>Would I even know how to play a skald, bard or healer at 50?  Um, yeah...there's not much difference PvE at 50 than at 20.  This isn't like a difficult thing to learn how to do.  It certainly doesn't take 10+ days (240 hours) of /played to do.<br><br>For RvR it matters more game time IN RvR than anything else.  Starting at 50 instantly or 50 after 10 days/played PvE makes little difference IMHO.<br><br>Is it different at 50 than 35+ (probably 40 by now) for RvR?  Um, yeah, you don't have to worry about getting ganked by purples, you can make a reasonable contribution to your team, and you don't get asked to leave because you're under 35 and lagging the Relic raid up.  And if you have 10 days /played you have 240 hours of RvR experience...not 10 days of snare pull mob, mez adds, smack mob, rinse and repeat.<br><br>&quot;Sure xp grinding is boring and tedious, but that's similar to schooling when you were young. &quot;<br><br>Gee, this isn't schooling.

It supports the rights of the consumers and I'm all for that even if I may never wish to exercise those particular rights.  <br><br>In this case it's my belief that Mythic believed that it would be an easy bluff to send a cease and desist letter to get someone to stop what they consider to be &quot;bad&quot; regardless of the desires of the consumers.

It was actually a woman, who suffered third degree burns on her abdomen and genitalia.&quot;<br><br>The coffee was too hot...sorta.  The higher the temp, the better the coffee (or so they tell me).  The caveat of course is that at these temps, spilling some on yourself is a bigger deal than at lower temps because you can cook yourself easily and very quickly in these scenarios.<br><br>Now, assuming that you're selling coffee at a drive through, you kinda have to guess that this coffee is going to be consumed on the road, usually by folks driving.  Folks who might be used to coffee made at home by your run of the mill Braun or Mr Coffee maker...not coffee heated to the temps that a commercial grade coffee maker goes.  <br><br>Is it reasonable to force sellers to label that this coffee is heated at a much higher temp than from home?  Yah, obviously more care must be taken when the coffee is first received because its a good 20-30 degrees hotter than you normally expect.<br><br>Is it reasonable that sellers allow coffee to cool to a more reasonable temp before selling (or in the case of McD's simply lowered the brewing temp) in a mobile environment more prone to spills?  Probably.<br><br>Is it a case of protecting the consumer from her own stupidity?  Iffy.  Folks spill coffee on themselves a lot.  In most cases, they get slightly scalded.  In this case she suffered severe burns.  So yah, there are some scenarios where you need to warn someone that something is not quite what they are used to and more care needs to be taken.  <br><br>It's also a case of corporations making certain value judgements that shouldn't be encouraged.  Prior to this event, companies could do a cost analysis and figure that settleling out of court was more cost effective than either letting coffee cool or losing some sales because the coffee isn't that much better than the competitors.  Never mind the fact that burns are a really nasty way to be injured.<br><br>As a shareholder I'm all for profit...the more the merrier...but not at the risk of injuring me, the consumer in gruesome ways (or even non-gruesome ways, thanks).<br><br>As much as I disklike suing, it's an important and key tool to insuring that companies don't sacrifice our safety for an extra 2 cents on thier dividends.<br><br>Vinea<br><br>PS Leisure time is not free...or we wouldn't be working so much to have some. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/13/02 6:52:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rtfm.txt width=100 height=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BSI suing Mythic RE:IRL Auctions - Enjoy Scirocco</span><hr size=1> vinea says:  <b><i>As much as I disklike suing, it's an important and key tool to insuring that companies don't sacrifice our safety for an extra 2 cents on thier dividends.</b></i><br><br>So in other words, you are saying that YOU want to pay for other people's stupidity when you buy that cup of coffee, and expect the rest of us to follow suit.  Note that the coffee isn't any safer now; there's just a warning for the idiots and a higher price tag to cover the cost of the lawsuit and more insurance.  Call it a "moron tax" if you will.<br><br>A lot of this could be avoided by simply doing away with juries in most civil cases.  What function do they serve anyway?  They don't understand law or the broader ramifications of the awards they are giving, and they only serve to perpetuate an area of law that is artificially kept alive by huge jury awards.  Don't tell me huge jury awards are necessary to keep society in line, because apparently every country outside of the United States seems to do this quite well without resorting to litigation. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utudamorf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tudamorf</A> at: 2/13/02 6:03:51 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=271.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=271.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=271.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=271.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=271.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~msippel/thedruidsgrove/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.threadControl?topicID=271.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=271.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27>General - DAOC</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
