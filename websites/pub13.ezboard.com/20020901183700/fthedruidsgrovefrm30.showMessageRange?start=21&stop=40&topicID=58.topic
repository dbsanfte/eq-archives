It is the same as talking about Shamans without Torpor.  The spell is out there.  If you omit it from balance discussions then it remains possible that druids with it are unbalanced (too good).  If it were so rare as to be essentially non-existant, fine (e.g. ancient spells), but it is no where near that.  When talking about balance you need to assume the charater has all his spells, max AA and gear appropriate for the top 25% (or there abouts). <p>____________<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13463"

<br>
The Druids here on DG tend to be the high end long time Druids and, for the most part, have access to the best guilds and gear and yet still only half the people here seem to have it.<br>
<br>
I also point out that anyone can say yes in a poll whether they even play a Druid or not. Now we all know that other classes would not dream of messing up the poll results *smiles* (I'd like to see the names of who voted)<br>
<br>
Moonfire being sold for 20k makes the spell non-existant for me. I have never had more than 8k to my name and most of my upgrades have tended to be no-drop which means I cannot sell my old gear for plat.<br>
<br>
I would venture to guess that the "real" number of level 60 Druids with Moonfire would be in the 25-30% range and not 50%.<br>
<br>
Even balancing a class based on spells/equipment that 50% of the class has no hopes of getting seems a bit unfair.<br>
<br>
Many many many people pick the Druid Class as they are casual players being able to play for a day here and there (not talking about 30 mins a day) and as such cannot accumulate Raid Points or Plat or even be in a high end guild that require steady participation.<br>
<br>
This is why I like the concept of the Anchient (sp?) spells. Toss the heavy players a bone but Moonfire and Mask of the ??? are not Anchient spells and IMHO after a few months of being introduced into the games they should be placed in the "obtainable" catagory IE Skyfire drop cycle.<br>
<br>
The "only" reason to keep the spells rare IMHO is to allow the uber guilds to keep farming them for huge profit. I'm not saying that the uber guilds only kill mobs for these spells but I'm sure the large guilds Druids all have their spells and the extras are most certainly not being given out.<br>
<br>
More likely they are being sold at a huge profit or are sitting in the bank as incentives to recruit the best players.<br>
<br>
Nothing is wrong with doing this from their point of view but it does nothing for the rest of us. We either farm till we don't want to play anymore in order to afford these spells or we do without.<br>
<br>
As you can probably guess I HATE HATE HATE the current system in place with the spell drops. As has been pointed out time and again - melee's have dozens and dozens of weapons to choose from - casters do not. We get ONE spell type every few levels.<br>
<br>
Imagine if melee classes only had to choose between maybe a few dozen weapon for their entire 1-60 span. They ONLY had one weapon to upgrade.<br>
<br>
How many level 60 tanks are using a level 50 or 55 weapon and only that weapon?<br>

I agree wholeheartedly.  Spells as loot was a really poor idea.  If they were gonna do it that way there should have been a much larger variety of spells that showed upgrades within the levels.  Such as Moonfire at level 60 was good, but you could find a rarer level 60 spell that was even better.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the game has always been melee biased.  Even after the &quot;caster balancing&quot; this game will still be biased in melee's favor. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uteaenea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teaenea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#333399>(7/30/02 10:39:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> On Cazic, Mask of the Stalker is going for 15K<br>

I am not bringing up the point to argue in favour of dropped spells.  I don't really like that they are dropped, though I am in a possition that it does not effect me too much (that said, I still do not have Mask of the Stalker and certainly wish I did).<br>
<br>
My point is that you can't talk about balancing classes without discussing their full potential that is reasonably acquirable.  With Ancient spells dropping only off of Vulak, I feel reasonable in saying ok - exclude those.  But Moonfire drops off of a ton of mobs and is generally available in the market - though at a very high price.  None-the-less, Moonfire is seeling today for what a Sarnak Battle Shield sold for a year ago.<br>
<br>
To me, talking about balance in the way this thread is designed to suggest is the same mistake as saying &quot;Well yes the [Mage/Cleric] epic is much stronger than all the others, but it is also much harder to get.&quot;  So what?  Mine was easy and it is a piece of crap I use only because as of yet, I have not gotten a better drop.  I would much rather have a hard quest with a great reward than an easy quest with a poor reward, because eventaully I will finsih that harder quest.<br>
<br>
It was the same foolishness that created the long abandoned &quot;hybrid penalty.&quot;  When the game was created, a level 50 Palladin was better than a level 50 warrior.  The solution was to make getting to 50 harder for the paladin than the warrior.  Well so what?  That is stupid because eventaully the paladin gets there and he is just plain better.<br>
<br>
You cannot balance power with difficulty or rarity (well, you can with rarity, but then it really has to be rare to the point of being nearly unique on any one server).<br>
<br>
That is my point.  If you balance Druids assuming moonfire does not exist, but in fact, 25% of the Druids do have moonfire, then you have ptoentially thrown game balance out of wack for those that have it.  Now, actually, this is not much of a problem with moonfire because it is a nuke and just a moderate upgrade from the store bought Wildfire.  But there is no reason this same arguement can't be used for Torpor or Can 5 (without which Shaman are merely good at recovering mana, not god like), as an example.  Or imagine CH was the same rarity as moonfire - do we say - ahh, poor clerics really need a healing boost?  Of corse not, because eventually, enough clerics would get it and (imagine being a Cleric with CH in a game not totally designed around it) the game really would be out of balance needing a retuning. <p>____________<BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13463"

<br>
Assume everyone has every spell and "screw" those that are unable to obtain them.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Assume everyone has only the vendor spells and those that are able to obtain the dropped spells will be a bit stronger than the average Druid.<br>
<br>
Let us not forget that Moonfire is only 123 more damage over the vendor spell wildfire.<br>
<br>
I do not care if Moonfire drops off 20 mobs. As long as the spell drops off a mob that the "average" Druid cannot take down or cost so much that the "average" Druid cannot afford them it has the same effect.<br>
<br>
The only reason any spell costs so much is because it is rare. Now you say that it drops off all these mobs yet still costs 20k+ and I will say so what.<br>
<br>
If the drop was off a common mob and the drop was rare then no  problem. Enough of those mobs would be killed to have the spell drop enough.<br>
<br>
If you make it a semi-rare drop of a seldom killed mob then the spell will trickle in so slow that most people cannot obtain it. Then you have the added effect that "some" guilds do not want you unless you have this rare spell (Read C3) and you compound the problem.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
A druid cannot get into an uber guild because he is required to have all his spells.<br>
<br>
A druid cannot obtain all his spells unless he is in an uber guild.<br>
<br>
Catch-22<br>
<br>
The apparent answer (as I have suggested) is to make new spells (not including the anchient) rare for only the first six months and then make them common drops. (or if rare put the drop on a zone table - any mob in that zone has a small chance to drop the spell)<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Better yet<br>
<br>
Make them vendor spells priced in line with what they are worth. IE Put Moonfire on a vendor for 1-2k.<br>
<br>
In closing you are correct. How can we balance classes as long as we have a moving target - some missing spells and some now. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

Mask of the Stalker and Moonfire from THO,<br>
<br>
Seasons cost me 700pp (thx whoever that was who obviously got confused with the price of winter/summer and I shameless took it!)<br>
<br>
That said, there aren't many druids in my guild (and our ally, sister guild) and I am the only one with both stalker moonfire.<br>
<br>
In the current format these spells represent the &quot;rarities&quot; of high end gaming.  I don't like having cookies/carrots dangled in front of me, but I do like having rewards for putting in the time to raid nearly every day. Ancient spells were the right idea to reward raiding druids but the vanilla lvl 60 spells are just a little bit too rare for our class. It isn't nice to get a spell that every druid should have after long hours spent raiding high end mobs.<br>
<br>
IMHO they should nearly double the number of spells for all casters between lvls 55-60, there should be a variety of spells all rare some off of high end mobs others from quests and others just common drops so that most druids can walk up to one another and compare spells and find that they DON'T have the same spells but the different combinations can both get the job done.  That said, it isn't going to happen, so they really ought to increase the drop rate on some druid spells. THO has been dropping two copies of Elnicks every time we have killed him in the passed month and there are many many fewer wizards than druids.  We have been lucky to get two moonfires out of those kills and the druids there fell over themselves when they heard what the drops where while the wizzies said &quot;oh, yeah Elnicks, cool, whatever&quot;<br>
<br>
Sadly, the state of affairs is something like:<br>
<br>
10 wizards of lvl 60<br>
<br>
3 attend raids with their guild hoping for spells<br>
4 already have all their spells<br>
3 more pop in and out but don't make an effort or don't have a guild that can raid<br>
<br>
20 spells drops in XX time frame giving all the wizards their spells plus extras to fatten guild coffers for the guild in question.<br>
<br>
30 druids of lvl 60<br>
<br>
10 attend raids whenever they can be squeezed in<br>
10 solo and have given up trying to get into raids, or don't have the guild connections to be able to<br>
10 are PL'ing their new monk/cleric/rogue and are on their way out of the druid class<br>
<br>
in the same XX time, 2-5 spells will drop. <br>
<br>
Somehow Verant logic says &quot;more druids than wizards = wizards should get more spells drops than druids...&quot; <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=204212" target="_new"><img src="http://vinculum.eqgov.com/signatures/ArcheironSignature.gif" border=0></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utilienvenator.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tilien Venator</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Might be Housebroken</span><br>  Posts: 293<br> <font color=#333399>(7/30/02 2:21:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well...</span><hr size=1> Stalker costs less then Moon?<br>
<br>
WTF? We have 3, THREE, copies total of stalker and yet moon seems to drop every 3rd mob for us.<br>
<br>
I do wish there were some ancient spells in game. All the rogues get to show off their 50 billion 15 and 16 dmg pokies, yet we casters pretty much have the same spells as a tradehound.<br>
<br>
That and almost all guilds that can get them, keep a few copies of the various spells (kei, moon, group eggo, etc) around for new recruits.<br>
<br>
Prices do and will drop. Look at what the high level Kunark and SoV spells go for these days. Was looking through the bazaar last night and not one older druid spell was more then 1k. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96131><B>Tilien Venator</a><BR>

When an expansion first comes out, only the casters in that guild will get the items. As time goes by, other guilds will be hitting those targets and getting the spells for their casters, while guilds that have enough either move to other targets or start stacking up the spells. Within a few months the spells are hitting the market, and the price will continue to drop as those targets continue to die. The only spells that should be very rare for long periods of time are the ancient spells. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udarklumina2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>darklumina2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333399>(7/31/02 2:43:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> I got moonfire sometime ago for 8k.. someone asked me for a price check and that is what I gave him =D<br>
