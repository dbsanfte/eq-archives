Verant has stated that you need to have the full listed mana to cast a spell, regardless of spec check.  They also have told us exactly how much mana it takes to cast a given spell.  So if you stand and have no mana regen buffs, you know that the moment (actually tick = 6 seconds, we know mana and HP regen on ticks, you can see the bar move when you med) you go from not being able to cast, to being able to cast, you had EXACTLY the mana listed for the spell.  Now if there is mana left, the spec kicked in.  Try it 100 times, and let us know what happens Gip.  This is simple enough to have monkeys test it.<br>
<br>
Now if the question is, how much is the spec kicking in for, this is much harder to test for.  But that is NOT what is being discussed here.<br>

<br>
<br>
Healing Adept<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
- 10% efficiency on all heals.<br>
- A reliable, constant, dependable increase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Healing Gift<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
- An extra heal, 10% of the time.<br>
- Unreliable, meaning that for full efficiency, one has to allow a little leeway in your parties HP bars to account for a possible double-heal (though of course only recommended on durable party members, not enchanters etc!)<br>
- Looks good!<br>
<br>
<br>
The sensible choice appears to be Healing Adept, I would say.  However, the flashing lights and instant glory of Healing Gift have won me over for the next week or so; I am giving myself a little break after chasing Mass Group Buff for so long. :)<br>

<br>
Scirocco's premise assumes that if your specialization skill check is successful, the reduction in the amount of mana the spell costs is directly and invariably proportional to your skill level.  If there is a random component involved, then Gipper is right, the test is flawed.  Not totally invalid as he claims, but exhibiting a much higher margin of error.  Do we have info from Verant that this reduction is constant given a constant skill level?<br>
<br>
For example, take a 300 mana spell.  If spec kicks in and there is a 1-20% mana cost reduction, a 1% reduction would not be noticable, as I believe all spells cost more more than 3 mana.  This would also make it very difficult to ascertain the amount of mana left by removing depleted mana by additional attempts to cast other spells - although of course you can get a decent estimate checking immediately with a low cost spell, immediately after a high cost spell (e.g. cast PoTG then try a spell that costs less than 12 mana - also assumes the minimum percentage reduction is 1%).<br>
<br>
Not sure why I am following up on this... I just find it hard to believe someone would refute methodology that is apparently sound. <p><BR><br><B><I><img src="http://www.druidmail.com/santerre2.gif">Santerre.</I></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/28/01 12:17:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/smallface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Archetypical</span><hr size=1> <i>Do we have info from Verant that this reduction is constant given a constant skill level?</i><br>

You are a flamer that has been caught in a flawed logic and will not let it go.<br>
<br>
1) There is nothing that is 100% certain.  There is only degrees of confidence.  This is the basis of statistics.<br>

It isn't stated like a research paper but this is a message forum not a journal. <br>
<br>
Given: <br>
1. When attempting to cast a spell you must have the stated mana cost in your mana pool.<br>
2. When specialization kicks in the actual cost of the spell is reduced.<br>
<br>
Method:<br>
1. Reduce mana pool until a fairly high mana cost spell in your specialization can't be cast.<br>
2. Wait around attempting to cast the spell.<br>
3. When the spell casts your mana pool will either be minus the full cost of the spell and empty within the margins of error or have some amount remaining.<br>
4. Attempt to cast a range of decreasing mana cost spells. When one starts to cast you have at least that much mana left in your mana pool within the margins of error.<br>
5. Repeat 2-4 to aquire more data points upon which to test a hypothesis.<br>
<br>
Sources of Error:<br>
1. Client/Server syncronization. Mana pool on client may not reflect the true value on the server. The sync time appears to be approx 6 seconds so an error of +/- (2  * mana/tick).<br>
2. Mana regen. The higher the mana regen rate the higher error #1 is. Stripping all mana regen items/buffs and standing reduces mana regen. <br>
<br>
So if 19 times out of 20 you can cast a 50 mana spell after testing a 300 mana one then you can state : There is a approx a 95% chance of a 17% +/- 1% mana reduction when casting a specialization spell. This still leaves open the possibility of a higher chance of a smaller mana reduction. With the margin of error of mana left we can never know if there is a 100% chance of a mana reduction on the order of 4% or less. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urandomuser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>random user</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/31/01 9:09:36 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Archetypical</span><hr size=1> Well damn, I read this thread to try and get an idea of what other druids are going to choose, and all I find I need to say is:<br>
<br>
/ignore gippah<br>
<br>
There are people who believe that the US landing on the moon was faked.  It's really just not worth it trying to debate the point with those people.  Just let them believe what they believe and move on IMO.<br>
<br>
Right now I am leaning towards<br>
<br>
Mental Clarity to 2<br>
<br>
and then I'm not sure.  I usually play with a cleric so the healing is less useful for me...<br>
<br>
I find that I don't DD that often so casting fury isn't that important either...<br>
<br>
Getting mental clarity to 3 for 6 more points seems a bit excessive for right now... something that I will do eventually but not before I get some class skills I think.<br>
<br>
Right now I think I'm leaning towards the controversial spell casting mastery, which reads:<br>
<br>
Each skill increases the caster's chance of successfully using his specialization skill for the spell he is casting. <i>This works for all spell types.</i><br>
<br>
I'm specc'd in alteration, but from the description, it seems that this will increase my chance to get mana reduction for conjuration (ie winged death, probably the spell I cast most often) will be increased by 5, 15, or 30% depending on what level I have.  If this is the case, it could be well worth it to get for evo and conjuration spells.<br>
<br>
Of course, if the chance to get specialization goes from 1% to 1.05% for a 50 skill point capped spell type, it's not that useful.  If no one else has gotten this specialization by the time I have to decide, I'll probably take it and run some tests (which gippah would most certainly find flawed :P)<br>
<br>
If it turns out that someone else does this first and finds out that this is useless, I think I'll end up taking 2 levels of reinforcement.<br>
<br>
I'd like to hear what other druids are going to choose, and if you have already listed them and gotten them, whether you think they were good decisions.<br>
<br>
And please, remember, don't feed the trolls.<br>

<br>
Actually, that's the second part of the experiment. For Gip's test, we're just checking the chance of success, so as long as there is sufficient mana left after the first cast to cast a low-mana spell (in the 5 to 10 range), then we can count that as a successful spec skill check.  Thus, any variability in the amount of the reduction (even ignoring the fact that I saw a consistent mana reduction % on successess) shouldn't affect my estimate of a 5% failure rate at max spec.<br>
<br>
The second part of the test does try to determine the size of the mana reduction (and whether it is variable or constant).  I'll have to dig out my notes on my prior post on this, but the mana reduction from my tests was a consistant amount about 13% to 15%.  Thus, after casting a 300 point spell, I appeared to have 43 to 45 mana left with a successful check.  Consistently.<br>
<br>
Yes, Verant could have changed things since then.  I invite folks to go out and do some testing of their own and report it back here.  <br>
<br>
BTW, I didn't key off ticks.  When I got close to the amount needed to cast the spell (yes, you can visually estimate this point with experience), I would start spam-casting (call it 0.5 seconds between attempts if you want).   That way, I would start casting as soon as I had sufficient mana.  Time consuming?  Yes.<br>

<br>
Why?  because I nuke alot and I use ro dot alot.  Ive found since then that Ro fizzles far far far less than it did before. Ok well I have no specific secentific stats however before in one battle I would fizzle ros atleast once...now its like maybe everye 4-5 kills....to me thats worth it.  So basially this argument about spec above seems that it does make a difference ....well it has to me. <br>
<br>
<br>
Why do I use ros?  dont ask ....I have my reasons and ive found it to be most efficent with the mobs im killing. Oh im also speced in evocation which means I use less mana when I use ro's generally.<br>
<br>
<br>
oh btw..  I chose crit nuke and then crit heal after that because I use both a considerable amount.  I got 8 points to obtain now and Im probably going to put 4 points into crit nuke and heal again. I feel 1 point a tick is so minimal (I could have a level 16 chanter with breeze parked next to me for better when im soloing an din raids i dont need that) that its not worth the time and effort taken into getting those points.<br>
<br>
