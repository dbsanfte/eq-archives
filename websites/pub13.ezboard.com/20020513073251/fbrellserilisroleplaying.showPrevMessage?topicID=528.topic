(longer than the others..)</span><hr size=1> The day was long for the Giants within the fort in the great divide.  Xican had healed himself, and the wounded Giants, but they were not enough to handle a full assault.  Only hours from night fall, Xican snuck out of the fort.  He bound across the Great Divide, in his trademark, form of a wolf.  He came to a stop as he saw a brigade of Storm Giants!  The fort would be saved it seemed.<br>
<br>
After stopping and talking with the Storm Giants, getting them up to speed on the fort's condition, the Giants turned, and headed back toward Kael Drakkel.  Two staying behind, and following Xican.  Xican lead the two giants to the fort.<br>
<br>
The rest of the day the fort was quiet.  There was little movement, and the single posted guards at the entrance, and back were vigilantly watching over, ready to cause alarm.  Eventually the day faded, and only the light of the moon was left.<br>
<br>
The sentry's guarding the fort were dignified, now.  Determined to fight to the death for their cause.  After the moon faded behind the clouds a cry of battle sounded, and the Coldain invaders ascended the small hills to the fort.  It would be only minutes 'til they reached the fort, and Xican was conferencing with the 4 Storm Giants at the centre of the fort.<br>
<br>
Xican sighed softly as he spoke.  &quot;Our chances are slim.  4 able bodied Elites, 2 scouts, and 3 berzerkers, myself and some wounded, who have refused to stay idle for this battle.&quot;  Xican's head snapped to the side as the clash of battle was near, now.  &quot;That's them...Take as many as you can with you...Will bring these tiny bastard's down with us if we have to!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Giants lept in to position.  Their size allowed for some tactic, thankfully.  Xican shouted to his comrades now, instructing them for battle.  &quot;Two Giants hold the gate!!!  When one falls another replaces him!  We keep it like this until they stop, or we run out of men!&quot;  None of the Giants knew what would happen, they simply knew to fight, and they did.  They knew Xican met with the reinforcements that never came.  They knew he was their only chance.<br>
<br>
Xican sat in the middle of the fort, unmoving, the cool snow begining to seep in to his pants.  He could hear the Giants and the Coldain fighting, his eyes however, were ont he ground.  The Giants slowly retreated, back.  2 had fallen, and now they were allowing the coldain to move in to the fort.  The Giants fought hard, but were being overwhelmed, they never stood a chance.<br>
<br>
Xican sprung to his feet, his eyes flicking to a coldain that had squeezed past the guards.  Xican's right hand flung out releasing a small dagger which struck the coldain's throat.  The small man fell to his back.  The small coldain lay in pain as his body was wracked with pain, showered in his own blood.<br>
<br>
Xican's eyes gazed up, seeing the whole of the coldain forces within the walls of the fort, his comrades falling.  This battle was over, and he had lost.  Xican's eyes slowly closed as he stood in the centre of the fort, his hands rising above his head, palms to the sky.  His body shuttered with a scream, as columns of flame erupted from his body.  An awe-inspiring display, as pillars of flame resinated and sprung from Xican's form.  8 massive pillars of flame thrusted in to the sky, before arching back down to crash down upon the fort, lighting it and it's occupants a-blaze with flame.<br>
<br>
The fort was forced to succumb to the flame of Xican's assault, before exploding in a massive array of flame.  The fort burned throughout the night, no signs of life stirring.  The coldain guards at Thurgadin had witnissed the display, but chose not to investigate 'til morning.<br>
<br>
Morning came, and with the rise of the sun, 4 Kromriff battalions made their way to the fort.  The fort was nothing but rubble, but could be repaired, with some work.  They raised the Kael Drakkel flag, for the Coldain to see, before moving within the fort's walls, investigating...<br>
<br>
There was no sign of life, beneath the rubble, Coldain bodies were looted, and thrown aside, by the hundreds.  Several giants who had friends, or family stationed here, were proud, knowing they fought hard.  They cleared the rubble, and found nothing but corpses.  Eventually coming to Xican, who lay unconcious, barely breathing.  Immediately the Giants moved him to a tent they had set up for wounded, which was vacant at the moment.<br>
<br>
Xican's body lay on a slab of granite, he was a mess of blood and gore, mostly his.  His left eye was crusted over with blood, the right, swollen shut, his chest a mess of gashes and cuts.  His right arm was obviously broken, the bone in his forearm protruding through the skin.  The giants worked to revive him, but it was unsure if he would survive.<br>
<br>
Weeks went by since the battle.  The Coldain had cut losses that night, and decided to leave the fort, for now.  They still could not figure how one person could level the fort the way Xican had.  They had decided it was impossible, and denied it happened.  They were right.  Before the battle, Xican had the storm giant reinforcement's evacuate the fort of all wounded, he told nobody, but soaked the fort with oil he had requested of a gnome friend, a highly flammable form of Gnomeish firework fluid, so to speak.  He had planned a true suicide mission.<br>
<br>
Xican lay on the slab, within the fort, dead.  The giants had tried effortlessly to revive him, alas it was to no avail.  They had abondoned the tent, letting Xican to rest, and return to the earth, from wence he came, none daring to desocrate the now sacred place of his resting.  Rulak had come and stood outside the tent.  The day before, he had pronounced Xican dead.  He was now to give a Eulogy, in Xican's honour.<br>
<br>
Rulak began, &quot;Xican was brave, he had put the will of King Tormax before his own life, as a true warrior would.  He was confused when he first came to us, but he learned the ways of Kael Drakkel, and he honoured us with his sacrifice.  Only one thing can be said for Xican...&quot;  Rulak was cut off by an arrogant tone at the tent's entrance.  &quot;Ya, he's got one helluva head ache...&quot; Grumbled Xican, the battalion of storm Giants in attendance turning in awe to the once dead, now living Druid.  Rulak only gasped and exclaimed, &quot;HOW!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Xican's body, now unscathed, though only wearing his pants, which were tattered, and slightly revealing, at the moment.  &quot;I was dead, huh?  Karana in all his infinite wisdom decided it simply wasn't my time...&quot;  With the words, Xican strode slowly past Rulak, and stops for a moment, speaking.  &quot;Thanx friend...&quot;  Rulak nodded in acknowledgement before replying, &quot;What was it like to be dead?&quot;  The question lingered for a moment...<br>
<br>
Xican leaned down, donned his fixed breast plate, and the rest of his armor, which had all been repaired by the giants.  He, knew he could stitch his pants himself in no time, and he would.  &quot;It sucked, Rulak...I really don't recomend dying.&quot;  Rulak chuckles heartilly before posing another question.  &quot;Where to now, Druid?&quot;  Xican stopped in the snow, which was ankle deep.  &quot;SureFall Glade...To my home.  I'll need some time to think, I may return, one day.&quot;<br>
<br>
With the words Xican's hands rose to the sky, opening a shimmering gate of crystal light, and stepped within it.  Moments later he appeared in Surefall Glade, and slowly made his way to his home, in Qeynos, greeting his Druid trainers, and friends along the way.  He stopped in to give a rose to Holly, on patrol in the Qeynos Hills...The two had always had a close friendship, and perhaps more, though they'd never admit it.<br>
<br>
Xican breathed in the fresh smell of the sea, and the busy fish market of South Qeynos, as he frequented the local markets, sine he'd been away so long.  He restocked his house with food, and took off his armor, and slid in to his usual tunic and pants.  Then, with a heavy heart, for all the lives he'd taken in his life, he hung up his bone handled scimitar, the emerald in the hilt shimmering softly against the setting sun, from it's mantle position on the wall.<br>
<br>
*OOC*  Looks like the end of Xican's adventures...Or maybe just this chapter coming to an end.  ;) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63622">Xican's profile</a>
