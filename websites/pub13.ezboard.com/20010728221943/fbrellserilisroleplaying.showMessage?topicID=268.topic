<br>
I am of the first born of Neriak. My blood is easily traced, through only one Great House, to the King and Queen themselves. I have sat with royalty and nobility. I was baptized to the Prince’s service by the highest of the Order, the High Priest herself. <br>
<br>
I am a Knight of Shadows, formally trained by Neriak’s greatest arms masters, strategists, and spiritual leaders. I was prepared by the best tutors money, and influence, could acquire. <br>
<br>
I am a destroyer. I have taken the lives of hundreds. I have spared none, and taken every opportunity to use my training to further the wishes of my Lord, the Prince of Hate. <br>
<br>
I viewed the world through cold eyes. My mind concerned only with servitude and duty. My hate was a fire that drew others to my call. I was a leader on the battlefield. And held up as example to others, of what true service to the Father meant. <br>
<br>
I had no free will. My mind, heart and soul were my Prince’s to use to His goals. <br>
<br>
I was the perfect Knight. The perfect servant of the Prince. <br>
<br>
You may ask me why then, you find me here. Traveling the lands with no title, no marker of my house, speaking of different ideals. <br>
<br>
You may ask me why I do not kill you on sight, as those of my order are known to with any of the light. <br>
<br>
You may ask me where my badge of rank is, for I wear it no longer. <br>
<br>
I may answer you if you ask. I may even quietly turn my back and leave. Or, maybe I will peer into your heart, and take your full measure, and offer you friendship. <br>
<br>
It is written that those who attain the loftiest heights, suffer the greatest fall. I can attest to this. For surely I have gone from greatness to obscurity. <br>
<br>
My name is stricken from the records of my people. My House denies I even existed. I have been given only 30 days to gather my affairs and leave my home, allowed to return only if I am prepared to die. My welcome would be that of 1000 blades. <br>
<br>
Let me tell you how this came to be. Let me tell you then, since you asked, what influenced one so true in service to the life of an exile. <br>
<br>
Let me tell you how the death of a bard, led to the salvation of my soul. Of how the contents of a mail satchel, and the words of an old tome, can change ones reason for being. <br>
<br>
My tale is a long one. Sit down and listen well, for I will only speak it once. It is not an old tale, and to share it I must recall many painful events from not so long ago. <br>
 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucennedi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cennedi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/16/01 10:37:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Knightfall</span><hr size=1> Long ago, Neriak had accepted the need for formal communications with other kingdoms. And so it was, bards were assigned duties to Nektulos. In the treaty, the Counsel of Neriak had decided that such missives may only be delivered to one of our kind at the edge of our sacred forest. That, even in the times of greatest crisis, no bard may enter into our lands without being destroyed. <br>
<br>
Today, Travis fills this post. Twice each day, it falls upon an emissary to travel to his post and collect the missives. <br>
<br>
They speak not at all. Merely exchange satchels and leave. Later on, a courier carries these bundles to Freeport, where they are sorted and delivered out across the land. <br>
<br>
Sometimes, treachery is afoot within my city. Treachery is not tolerated by the Royal Family. No effort is spared to confirm rumors of such. The Tier ‘Dal Empire must be protected from all its enemies. <br>
<br>
Word of a traitor had reached the ears of my Queen. Information about the movements of General Zirrix’s army towards the Fier ‘Dal homeland was being sent to the enemies of my people. <br>
<br>
The General was not informed of this, it being the Queen’s wish that he was not to be distracted with matters that could be handled within our city. <br>
<br>
I was ordered to seize the satchel as it traveled to Freeport, and to return with its contents. Once the traitor was revealed, his execution would follow in a swift and public manner. <br>
<br>
It was a small matter for me to share the touch of death with the courier. He fell at once, writhing at my feet in agony. Unable to bring voice to his pain, the severity of it so intense, he died a quick, terrible death. The black death, that only a touch from a Knight of the Prince can instill. <br>
<br>
&lt;he looks away from you as he speaks, and when he turns back his eyes are wet, glazed with tears&gt; I am sorry to pause, but while this was a thing of ease for me then, to remember it now is not easy. <br>
<br>
&lt;clears his throat and stares into the fire, continueing&gt; <br>
<br>
As I watched the Prince’s power torture the bard to death, he convulsed and sent the satchel forth, spilling its contents. <br>
<br>
Quickly I gathered them up and left for my city. It would not due to have others take note of the Queen’s business. A large leather bound book case would not easily fit back into the pack. So in my haste, I merely carried it home where I returned to my House and set it upon my night stand. Proceeding, I changed to my formal attire, and carried the mail satchel to the Queen’s advisor, the book case, forgotten in my quarters. <br>
<br>
Having fulfilled my duty, I returned to the outer patrols and then retired for the evening. That is when I realized I had forgotten to turn the book over to my Queen. <br>
<br>
I had let me haste to please overcome the proper execution of my duty. Without thought I pulled the horse hair braid from my drawer, and lit a black candle. I kneeled and said prayers to the Father as I lashed myself over my shoulder, 100 times with each hand. <br>
<br>
Tired, and in too much pain to allow easy sleep, I opened the volume. It was written in Elder Dragon no less. Being a the child of a Great House, I had full knowledge of the dialect and began to read. <br>
<br>
Never had I heard or read anything so blasphemous. Never had I studied a volume that so offended all I knew to be the truth of my life. It was the philosophy of a clearly heathen, light dwelling, self-important human. <br>
<br>
Nothing I had ever heard of compared to it. It was an offense, not only to Innoruuk, but to all of the God’s, and even the great Dragon of creation herself. <br>
<br>
The pure truth and wisdom within those pages, shattered who I was. It destroyed my faith in the purpose of my King and Queen, and in the service to my Prince, the Hatebringer. <br>
<br>
In the back of the text were notations. Written upon once blank pages. The text was positively ancient, even by Tier ‘Dal thinking. If the names and titles and dates were to be believed, this Tome had belonged to many of the most hated, and loved, historical figures Norrath had ever known. <br>
<br>
Within the text I found a chant. It was a verse to induce meditation. It was said within the book that the proof would be visited upon whoever practiced the trance. “That you would know the truth of all that was written here.” <br>
<br>
I sat down before my altar, but this time, my back turned to it, and began to cite the verse. <br>
<br>
My eyes closed on their own accord, and I was carried off into the ether of minds past. <br>

Whether I became them all at once, or separately, I cannot tell you. <br>
<br>
I felt chill the of a cool summer evening as my body temperature lowered with the setting of the sun. Troops of saurian warriors spread out before me, becoming less animated, less talkative. The night air growing cooler and slowing our metabolism. Thoughts of reclaiming our lands from the forest giants pushed aside, as sleep overcame me in the chilled air. My last thought was that of concern for my noble people. The Iskar Nation. <br>
<br>
I felt a child suckling upon my breast. The strange, yet satisfying feeling of nourishing your own young. When I looked down I saw a young Koada ‘Dal, eyes closed, mouth suckling upon my pastel, feminine teet. Before me, the Paladins and Clerics of my elven home assembled. Gazing with pride upon my child. The child that would, one day, become their King. <br>
<br>
I felt the call of my Master and instantly I arose. Fear taking hold of my as I pushed back my bench and floated away from my organ, up into the upper Temple where the Prince of Hate awaited me. I was one with the Prince then, I sensed the world through the eyes of a God. I saw the secret that no mortal should know, the true source of his Hatred, the reason he seeks more power. <br>
<br>
&lt;He shudders, and moves on, obviously unable to voice what happened next in that incarnation&gt; <br>
<br>
I saw through feeble eyes, fumbling to pierce the light as I made escape from the Paineel dungeons. My body scorched with pain. I rubbed the tears from my eyes and looked down at my palms. The skin was black, and my palms bloody. As I climbed over a hill in the darkness of the forest, I saw the gates of my home at last, and fell dead at the gates. <br>
<br>
I felt my body shift, and my stance lower. My sight changing from color to shades of gray, seeing farther into the night. A surge of energy filled my being as I took off in a run through the forests of the Fae. My paws scrapping and sending the dirt behind me up in a cloud, as I raced with the speed my lupine body provided. I looked up and felt the pull of the moon, and I stopped. Rearing back, I lifted my front paw and howled in praise of creation. <br>
<br>
And so I continued, experiencing pieces of other’s existence. I spent fleeting moments living within the mind of hundreds of others. <br>
<br>
Until finally….. <br>
<br>
I sang as I ran, the chant of my song sending strength through my legs. As I neared Freeport, I was hailed by a Tier ‘Dal Knight with a scroll in hand. Meaning only to snatch from him as I ran by, I felt the cold icy touch of death as we made contact, my legs giving out, and my voice failing. My body on fire, my flesh crawling as death began to claim me. My mind filled with the evil cackle of a dark God. My satchel spilled from my hands, and the Knight deftly scooped up its contents. A large leather bound book case would not quite fit and he tucked it under his arm, and gathered shadows. Leaving me to die. The pain. &lt;he shouts, startling you&gt; THE UNBEARABLE PAIN <br>
<br>
&lt;Cennedi stops his tale now. Sweat beading from his brow. His hand trembling as he reaches for his ale and clumsily wets his mouth&gt;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uwarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lost One </span><br>  Posts: 484<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/17/01 11:16:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   (Fallen Knight)</span><hr size=1> Wow is all I can say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
