        The hollow, and bone chillingly cold wind whipped through the<br>
knights long, dark brown hair. He could feel the freeze, as cold as the<br>
death that had become so prevalent here, race over his chiseled facial<br>
features as he tightened his jaw, and narrowed his eyes. Looking up the<br>
tattered flags of clans long since forgotten waved with an eerie and<br>
solitary undulation. This place was the home of Rallos. This place was the<br>
home of war, so many warriors, fighting for causes lost in the passage of<br>
time haven fallen here. Their ghosts, some say still wander the bloodied<br>
and tested grounds welcoming the new initiates into their lonely, and<br>
tortured post-mortem existence. Crystallian Imperium took a deep breath,<br>
inhaling the cold, dry air into his lungs and holding it, almost as if<br>
feeling and listening to those souls that tried to tell their tale. He<br>
exhaled sharply and opened his eyes again slowly. He didn't really know why<br>
he was here, but he knew that he had to be. So many questions were racking<br>
through his brain, into his very soul, tearing at him as he salivated for<br>
any answers that may come. He could feel, despite the cold, unwelcoming<br>
embrace of the great battle ground ominously known as &quot;The Arena&quot;, that he<br>
may just in fact taste some of those answers, satisfying his hunger for the<br>
time being. The ring that encircled his finger glistened, in defiance of<br>
the darkness and emptiness that encased him. It was all he had left of her.<br>
And in it, he gained some comfort as he continued slowly down the long,<br>
wide and empty hallway, as the flags wavered above him.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Speak to me.....&quot; the knight said softly as he reached behind him,<br>
unsheathing the long pole-ax that was his weapon in battle. He knew the<br>
spirits that wandered here, may be able to help him, or at least he hoped.<br>
The wall to his right suddenly curved inwards, providing a large opening.<br>
He looked out and onto the hallowed fighting grounds, littered with bones,<br>
weapons, armor, and other assorted items of those who had fallen here. He<br>
gazed skyward at the towering, stone markers that scraped the sky, almost<br>
as if they were acting as a conduit for the departed. Inscribed on the<br>
stone wall marking the entrance to the infamous fighting ground bore the<br>
markings &quot;Discord Reigns Within&quot;. It sent a chill down Crystallian spine as<br>
a particularly stiff gust of wind raced across his body. It had been a few<br>
weeks since the incident in the plains, and he still had no answers as to<br>
the meaning, still no idea as to what it meant. Everything had seemed so<br>
chaotic, with no order, everything seemed wrapped in...discord. He looked<br>
up again at the etchings the words burning into his mind as he nodded. He<br>
gripped his weapons tightly as he stepped into the arena, his foot smashing<br>
down upon the packed gravel with force. He walked slowly forward, the<br>
breeze becoming stiffer and colder with each step, he approached the small<br>
stone plateau and walked up it slowly. A thousand thoughts raced through<br>
his head before he reached the top, narrowing his eyes as he glared<br>
straight ahead, his hand on his weapons tightening as his other clenched<br>
into a fist.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I want answers....&quot; Crystallian said coldly and directly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;And you shall have them.&quot; came the deep, and eerily familiar voice from<br>
across him. Standing before him, his hand wielding a majestic, midnight<br>
black blade as the wind whipped and sheared through his long blonde hair.<br>
His body enveloped in armor as dark as night, the imposing figure managed a<br>
small smile as he looked back at Crystallian with his scarred and burned<br>
countenance.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crystallian took a step backward, putting himself in attack position as<br>
his face tightened. &quot;What did you put in me?&quot; he asked simply of the man<br>
who stood before him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Only the truth Crystallian....and now you must see that!&quot; came his quick<br>
reply as he raised his blade overhead, bringing down with force just as<br>
Crystallian managed to raise his weapon blocking the blow, before rolling<br>
aside and standing, weapon in hand. The dark human man smirked as he slowly<br>
angled Crystallian, who stood in a defensive position. &quot;Come on boy...you<br>
want the truth...find it.&quot; came his taunt as Crystallian charged forward<br>
swinging his blade sideways, as the human man ducked coming up behind the<br>
weapon, bringing his own blade down upon the pole-ax pinning it to the<br>
ground. The half-elven knight, spun releasing his blade as he came around<br>
the other side of the man with a forceful, but wide swing. The human man<br>
took his opportunity kicking the knight with his black, metallic boot<br>
forcing him to lose his balance. The human attempted to bring his unholy<br>
blade down upon the reeling knight, who just managed to leap out of the way<br>
and onto the stone surface, as the humans sword whizzed off the floor<br>
sparking in a majestic display. Then, with blinding quickness the human<br>
managed to change his momentum, again bringing his sword down upon the<br>
knight who lay upon the ground. Crystallian managed once again to raise his<br>
weapon and block the shot, holding it with all his strength as the human<br>
leaned down upon him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You cannot win this war boy, you haven’t learned how to fight this battle<br>
yet.&quot; came his cold voice from above as Crystallians jaw flexed<br>
involuntarily with strain as he used every ounce of his strength to keep<br>
the mans sword from coming down upon him. Crystallian, managing to lift his<br>
leg and kick the man off from atop him sending him backwards briefly, rose<br>
to his feet weapon in hand and charged at the temporarily dazed opponent.<br>
His blade high overhead as he ran towards him recklessly. The human man<br>
managed to regain his composure sidestepping the blow. Crystallian than felt<br>
the cold, blunt crack against the back of his head as his weapon fell the<br>
the ground with a clank, the knight, dropping to the icy floor with it.<br>
Crystallian managed to roll over just in time to see the human man smiling<br>
evilly over him before reality closed in upon him, shutting off, and all was<br>
black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The thunder boomed loudly overhead, shaking the small wooden house.<br>
Crystallian breathed heavily as the world erupted into colors once again.<br>
Where was he, was he alive? He seemed to feel nothing as he found himself<br>
standing inside the small house. A young human man sat on the bed in the<br>
corner of the room, his long blonde hair flowing down his neck as he<br>
cradled a small infant in his arms. On the other side of the house, in the<br>
shadows almost was another figure, it was a female figure, but he could not<br>
quite make it out....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Isn't he adorable?&quot; the young man sitting on the bed said happily as a<br>
wide smile encased his face<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Crystallian looked at the man in confusion &quot;Uh...Yeah, he's uh...he's...&quot;<br>
he awkwardly blurted out before the feminine voice behind him chimed in,<br>
making it evident that they were not aware of his presence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes...yes he is dear...our very own family love.&quot; she said in a voice<br>
almost near tears of happiness. She walked across the room, her face still<br>
in the shadows as she sat on the bed next to the man, leaning her head upon<br>
his shoulder and smiling down upon the young infant he cradled in his arms.<br>
&quot;I love you&quot; she said softly, cuddling up closely to him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The human man smiled as he leaned his head on hers, closing his eyes &quot;I<br>
love you too.&quot; came his wistful reply. Crystallian couldn't help but smile<br>
at them, those emotions, he had felt those, he had been there. He looked<br>
down at his finger, the ring still sparkling as he sighed, covering it with<br>
his other hand. The peaceful silence filled the room briefly, before<br>
suddenly a large crash echoed through the small house. The wooden door,<br>
collapsed upon itself, splintering throughout the room. The woman screamed<br>
as she rose to her feet in terror, the man placing the child in her hands<br>
rose to his feet, grabbing a small sword that rested on the wall near him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Go with him...go now!&quot; he said in an almost panicked sense as he looked<br>
into her eyes with urgency. The woman, understanding took the child and<br>
vanished into a corner of the house unseen from Crystallians perspective.<br>
From the remains of where the wooden door once stood two tall,<br>
frighteningly imposing figures marched through dressed head to toe in the<br>
same black armor Crystallian had known so well. From behind them came<br>
another man, his black hair flowing down his neck, his thin lips curved<br>
into a wicked smile as his long black robe flowed behind him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;It is time, Izual&quot; the man said with an evil, heart stopping voice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;No....Never....&quot; the young blonde haired human said as he raised his small<br>
iron sword up before him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Izual...Izual...Izual...you will thank me in the end.&quot; the man said with a<br>
small chuckle as he nodded towards him. The two men in black armor marched<br>
towards Izual. The human man raised his blade in defiance and attempted to<br>
bring it down upon one of the heavily armored guardians, who simply caught<br>
the blade in his hand and tore it from him with decisive force. The other<br>
armored man than brought a swift, and forceful blow to his head, before<br>
both men apprehended him tightly and carried him out of the small house<br>
behind the man in the robe, who smiled before flipping around and exiting<br>
the small place, and the sound of thunder cracked once again.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Crystallian watched as the tall, broad shouldered man armored in the same black armor he had seen so many times now lowered the branding iron into the molting, bubbling foundry, heating the irons until the glistened with an orange hue. During this the voice of a man came speaking from behind him, his voice growing louder and more powerful with each word.<br>
<br>
        “He is the truth Bantoxx, we must serve him as such.” <br>
<br>
        The man lifted the iron out of the foundry and began to slowly walk towards the other two. The blonde haired human, the same one he had seen earlier as he was taken away lay strapped down upon the table, utterly defenseless. Crystallian watched helplessly as the branding iron, the pattern on the end with symbol of hate, the symbol of Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
        “A new awakening, you will understand all and why we must destroy, why we must purge the land for only the chosen ones!”<br>
<br>
        The eyes of the helpless man shifted nervously towards the imposing figure slowly moving towards him, as he struggled futilely with his bonds. His breathing heavy and urgent, his face filled with fear and panic, as the other mans voice grew louder.<br>
<br>
        “You shall serve him well! You shall spread the doctrine of hatred throughout the lands! It is time! Zarn has ordered it, and it shall be done!” <br>
<br>
        The tip of the iron now over the face of the frightened man, hovering for a bit as it moved directly over his right eye. The man growled in as he continued to struggle with no avail. <br>
<br>
        “Now Bantoxx! Now you are a chosen one! Wear his insignia with pride!” the voice shouted loudly as the iron lowered down slowly to his eye before the sound of burning flesh could be heard briefly before the ear piercing screams filled the room mingling with the horrid sounds of disfigurement and the maniacal cackling of the owner of the voice. Then, once again, the thunder boomed.<br>
<br>
        The children inside the small temple cowered in the corner, as the tall men in midnight black armor and long black sword stood in front of them. Another man smiled evilly as he looked over the small elvish children. <br>
<br>
        “You shall be saved…” he said quietly as his lips curled into a wicked smirk, his eyes raising looking over the children. “These are lies here there is no Tunare. Only one thing truly exists, hatred. We shall save you.” He said nodding and looking up at one of the men standing behind him in the darkened armor. He stood stiffly at attention, looking forward into nothingness with his one eye, the other covered with an elaborate black patch. He took one step forward as the other man walked out of the temple, closing the door behind him. Crystallian looked on in horror…<br>
<br>
        “No!!” he yelled hopelessly. Before the screams of the children, as they were butchered by the men in the black armor filled the air. Suddenly the thunder cracked and he found himself outside the small temple, watching as the men exited the temple, there hands, swords, armor stained with blood. They surrounded the now defiled temple before a single torch was thrown atop the wooden roof, the flame ran up the frame of the temple, burning brightly in the night sky. The man, who had spoken earlier stood in front looking up as the temple began to burn before him, shouting loudly.<br>
<br>
        “They have been freed of a life of lies! We have saved them! We have served The Father!” he yelled into the night air, as the smoke bellowed out from the smoldering temple and covered the moon, darkening the forest. Once again the thunder cracked.<br>
<br>
        “Hail Bayle! Hail Bayle! The crowd chanted loudly as they gathered, looking high upon the balcony where the great hero Antonius Bayle stood watching from atop. Below him lay thirteen blocks, upon each one lay the head of a the men in black armor, standing beside them lay another thirteen men, outfitted in the bright golden armor of the Qeynosian guards. They wore helmets, completely enclosing their faces, and wielded large, heavy axes.<br>
<br>
        “Hail Bayle! Hail Bayle!” the crowd shouted before the Norrathian hero stood to his feet.<br>
<br>
        “Today, justice will be served. Today the plague that has bloodied our fair lands shall be cured. Today these thirteen murderers, butchers, shall pay the ultimate price for defying the law of the land. Today we shall once again be able to walk safely, and without fear from those whom wish to terrorize us. Justice will reign again!” the dignified hero of the Qeynosian people boomed in his deep, powerful voice before nodding below to the executioners. The crows erupted into wild cheers.<br>
<br>
        “Hail Bayle! Hail Bayle!” the axe cleanly severed the first mans head, bloodying the floors but despite the gore, the crowd cheered even louder as one by one each man met his fate.<br>
<br>
        “Hail Bayle! Hail Bayle!” ten, elven, twelve. It seemed the crowds thirst for blood could never be quenched, as the final man left his head on the block. A single tear streamed down his cheek from his one good eye, his blonde hair hanging before his face as the tear fell to the bloody floor below him. The executioner raised his axe high in the air as the crowd erupted, and brought it down and the thunder clasped, and all was dark…<br>
<br>
        “I had it all at one point…” a soft voice said in the darkness “A wife I loved, a son I never got to see grow up, but all was taken from me…”<br>
<br>
        “It was you…wasn’t it?” Crystallian said lowly into the void.<br>
<br>
        “Yes…it was. All the blood I spilled, all the horrors I have committed. I can never take them back, they changed me, warped me into a man I never really was. I suffer now for my sins Crystallian doomed forever for what I have done.” Bantoxxs’ voice said through the darkness “All I can really do is watch, watch as the father sins live on in thy son…Watch, helplessly.”<br>
<br>
        “I don’t…I don’t understand…” Crystallian said in a confused voice.<br>
<br>
        “I have watched as my son has grown into a strong, powerful knight. I have watched him find love in his life, the love that I once had but was stripped from me. I have watched my son, whom I loved so dearly fight with passion, with cause. I have watched my son with pride as to what he has accomplished, but knowing that inside him lies me, and what I had done…Crystallian…I think you already know.” The mans voice said with a sigh<br>
<br>
        “That was…me…” Crystallian said in shock as he remembered the small child that survived the kidnapping.<br>
<br>
        “Yes…It was, you were my son Crystallian. But listen to me, what you carry within is everything evil I have ever committed, every soul I have ever taken. There is not much time left my son, but you must fight that. You know how now, you understand what is in you Crystallian. You must fight for everything you have, for all that you have come to realize, for that ring that lay on your finger. Fight my son…fight…” the voice trailed off as Crystallian was left in the dark. Then, the thunder clasped once again… <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=198.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=195.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=196.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
