What are the better known guilds that are acceptable to Paladins (e.g, they fight for valor, compassion, etc).&quot;<br><br><br>Very, very, very, very few fit your parenthetical expression.  EQ is a game with cardboard NPCs that respawn, death has negligible long-term benefits, quests that aren't interactive in a meaningful way, and mechanics that highly encourage (to the point of necessitating) groupings that cross obvious RP boundaries.<br><br>There are guilds that are made exclusively of paladins/clerics or 'worshippers of good gods'.  EQ is (now at least) a MMOG dressed with a hint of RP.  As a percentage I have met just as many nice necros as I have paladins.  And just as many lieing/cheating paladins as I have rogues.<br><br>At the lower levels (where any duo suffices and areas aren't &quot;camped&quot;) RP is still very possible.  As you level inherent increase in game knowledge (and then designed for such knowledge areas) will inevitably shift your focus to more of someone playing a nice character who has X set of abilites, and you will see others like that as well.<br><br>Not sure if this helped or not.  But just some thoughts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaremulosia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AremUlosia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/knight.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/29/02 12:59:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15086.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~xionri/_uimages/TalidPA_.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin Guild/Server recommendations?</span><hr size=1> Well, if you want to switch servers a guild on the Tunare server is all RP - Ancienne Noblesse.

It's one of the very first servers and because of that several things have developed on our server to make life hard for a paladin; 1) There are a lot of lvl 60 paladins making us less valuable/needed/wanted, 2) The top guilds have people in them from the beta days and they all still hold the same prejudices against us that no longer apply, and 3) Those prejudices have been passed down to everyone else on the server by word of mouth, which lengthens our LFG time in higher level zones. Hell, in any zone.<br><br>When I was leveling up I would spend an average of 2 hours LFG and then 2 hours actually exp'ing before I'd have to log off for the night. Sometimes I got a group right away and sometimes not in the entire 4 hours I had to work with. That might be pretty normal for all servers. I don't know.<br><br>I don't think other people hear the constant insults that a Paladin on Mith Marr might hear though. Every class might hear "Such-and-such class sucks" every now and then, but Paladins get it all the time. Many times each day and in every zone. I was so berated by my last guild that it was one of the reasons I left. There's teasing and then there's descrimination. <br><br>Sorry this turned into a Mith Marr rant heh. Just trying to let you know how things are there. We used to have an RP guild called Companions of Light that only took "good" classes/races, but now they take anyone. <p><BR><BR><A HREF=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77809"><B>Whitefyre Nobleheart</B></A><BR><B><FONT FACE="Old English Text MT, Arial">Paladin of the 60th Light</FONT></B><BR>If I were an Autobot, I'd be:<br><a href="http://android5.com/misc/tests"><img border=0    src="http://android5.com/misc/tests/autobot/ironhide.gif"  alt="Click to see what Autobot you could be!"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujcasetn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jcasetn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Wandering Knight</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/31/02 4:38:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15086.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Paladin Guild/Server recommendations?</span><hr size=1> If you're into the RP thing pretty much any server has its share of RP guilds.
