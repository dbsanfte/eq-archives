I play him with my bard and duo (bard is 56) and they make an amazing team.  But clearly my friend is superbly equipped (1100ac for example) and I'm sure he could compete with some wizards around his level and not be too far off in damage output.  <br>
<br>
My druid was level 58 and I finally decided to finish off those last 2 blue (Slowly creeping towards 59 I was) and got 59.  Wildfire, POTC and Legacy.  Now I'm half tempted to put my bard onthe back shelf (she has been sort of a converted main as of late) even though she's  close to her epic and has more to do than my druid.<br>
<br>
I damn near quit my druid at level 58 (He hasnt leveled in months) and now at 59 I'm really wanting to play him and get into the class and all that.  58-59 is a great leap to me, and at 60 the class is awesome (grouped very effectively) at solo, duo, group, whatever.  A well played druid at level 60 decently equipped has a load of power.  <br>
<br>
However the jack of all trades power isnt vital to a guild in the high-end... This must have been stated a million times but that is the problem.  But any of you good druids out there know your solo and group power at all levels, especially 60, is immense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gardener in the Grove<br>Admin au naturel</span><br>  Posts: 2286<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 5:09:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28055.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cityviewsoftware.com/jennifer/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stirring up an argument....</span><hr size=1> Have I gone mad?

It isn't the latter, and if people want to imply that we don't know how to play in a group after all this time, they need to sit down and zip it before the foot inexorably rises to their mouth. And if other classes don't know already, then they were surely soloing or not paying attention in their groups.<br>

Second, the issue hasn't been groups but raiding and remaining viable in the endgame.

<br>
Hmmmmm<br>
<br>
What do people do at 60+ once they get a few AA points and even before?<br>
<br>
They raid. The end game IS raids.<br>
<br>
Unless you only use your Druid to power level needed classes or help others with quests and such you will be raiding and no matter how much a Raid Leader tries to find something for you to do NEVER NEVER forget this:<br>
<br>
If a Druid is assigned to heal on a raid the OTHER three healing classes are preffered on raids!<br>
<br>
If a Druid is assigned to nuke on a raid a Wizard or a Mage (due to added pet) is MUCH preffered over you!<br>
<br>
To a Raid leader a Druid on a high level raid is nothing but a 1/4 Cleric or a 1/2 Wizard who can help get late arrivers to the raid via an Egreee/COH link in zones that allow COH.<br>
<br>
Now please stop telling me that Druids heal just fine on high level raids or the Nuke like the wind because it's just not true. Our versitility means squat on raids as you are assigned to do one thing on a raid and if you are even allowed on a raid it is either because the Raid Leader is kind and will not turn people away (We have a VERY kind Public Raid leader on Eci who allows any class to come as long as you are not some dumbass *smiles*) or they are short the classes they REALLY need.<br>
<br>
We are really good in a single group (as was said) by we suck at raiding. So stop putting your hands over your ears and going la la la la la la. Facts are facts.<br>
<br>
God I just love the:<br>
<br>
"But Druids are great at healing the clerics as they are too busy"<br>
<br>
Why are they too busy? BECAUSE THE RAID NEEDS THEM Duh!<br>
<br>
"But Druids can do some good nuke damage so they do that on raids"<br>
<br>
BUT THE RAID WOULD STILL MUCH RATHER HAVE A WIZARD!<br>
<br>
and before I lose it more...<br>
<br>
The THINGS we USED to bring to a raid were snare, regen, ports after the raid, Damage Shields and SOW...<br>
<br>
WERE GIVEN AWAY TO OTHER CLASSES VIA AA SKILLS OR ITEM EFFECTS!<br>
<br>
Yep... they gave away the few things to other classes that used to be wanted.<br>
<br>
For sure Raid Leaders will "Find something for attending Druids to do on a Raid" but busywork (and it IS busywork) does not mean the class is alright.<br>
<br>
For god sakes give us some needed skill, make it cost a peridot or something so we will not use it in everyday groups but only on raids and let Druids who have worked their way up to 60 have fun like the rest of us.<br>
<br>
And a question for those who say all is well....<br>
<br>
Do you ONLY play a Druid in EQ or do you switch to an alt from time to time? Be honest. I see alot of people saying they love their Druid but for raids and such they play their alt.<br>
<br>
If switching to an Alt for raiding is not a sure sign that Druids are broken then I do not know what is. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

<br>
In Ssra, when I make groups, I slot myself into a caster group, all my clerics are leading melee heavy groups. So while my clerics are healing those classes who have at least several thousand of hitpoints over 3k, my druids are in groups with casters who average around 3-4khp fully buffed. <br>
<br>
The casters should not be getting hit all the time, therefore the druid is now in a semi-nuking role. Should the casters sustain damage, the druid's heals are just fine for quick spot heals. Everyone knows that if a caster is stupid enough to get aggro, not even a cleric's heals are going to be good enough to save them. Along with Nature's Recovery and Regrowth, that's over 50hp standing regen. More than enough to get most casters back to full HP without wasting a lot of mana.<br>
<br>
It's far from a perfect solution - there are quite a few encounters out there where the creature has some bastard AE's which eat everyone up. A druid is hard-pressed to keep a full group healed in these situations - but then again, so are most classes. However, I've got enough mana where I'm not going OOM doing it - unless it's an overly extended fight. However, for the most part, I find that in those groups, I'm able to take advantage of the druid's ability to both nuke and heal.<br>
<br>
Remember also that your usefulness at a raid is not only determined by your class, but by the intelligence of your raid leader. If the person leading your raid only thinks of you as this half-assed hybrid of a caster, you need to let him or her know exactly what you can do and what your limitations are.<br>
<br>
I know I don't know everything about all the classes out there, but my guild is good enough to give me suggestions on how to make things better - like shamen in mage groups for torpor heals, necros in cleric groups for mind wrack, etc. I know when I first started in the guild, the druid was just &quot;another healer to lead a group&quot; and I was the primary healer in places like ToV:N for rangers, monks, and bards. Meanwhile the cleric groups had one or two INT-based classes taking up spots in their groups.<br>
<br>
You guys can all complain about the druid class all you want, but even if Verant says they're going to revamp the whole class, it's not going to happen overnight. Best you learn how to play with what you have now, instead of hoping that someone is going to give you the ocean tomorrow.  Don't stop making suggestions on what could be made better, but don't ignore what you have because someone on these boards says, &quot;Spell XX Sucks!&quot;<br>

If you are getting this frustrated about all that you think we dont have move on, please, you'll have an anxiety attack. <br>
If you find yourself having to be a primary healer for an MA on a raid situation or a tank havy group, you should tell your guild officers to get more clerics, or make better decisions as to how groups are made. On most raids for us, epic 60 clerics outnumber druids by at least 1.5 to 1, or 2 to 1. A 60 druid is a great support class, I dont really see whats so hard for people to grasp about that. If we are used as a support class (to keep casters alive, clerics alive, hard nuke when its called, etc). I honestly feel a druid is pretty useless till 60, not the other way around.<br>
get heal 3, and a healing focus item and you can take most casters to full health from 50% with 1 shot of natures touch.<br>
And honestly, I dont know of any 'teir 1' guilds that turn druids aways with heal 3 that know what they are doing and can do it well. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260032 target=_new>Baron Stumps</a> 60 Leafblower Bertoxx

You went from 1 mana/tick standing to 10 mana/tick.  You could cast a port spell and by the time you got to the dungeon you had your mana back!  You could actually cast spells and then not HAVE to sit down, leave the computer and watch TV, you could actually do stuff IN GAME and still get mana.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Actually, level 60 is huge for druid power: Nature's Touch, Nature's Recovery, Moonfire, POTG, Stalker. I can't think of another class with so many useful level 60 spells.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  One reason for that is other classes get their spells earlier.  Cabbage/Glades at 59/60, Blessed Armor of the Risen at 58.  Moonfire at 60, Judgement at 56.  Nature's Touch 60, CH at 39 and Divine Light at 53.  Hell, wizards get harvest at 34, be nice if mask of the hunter was level 34.  Wizards get an AE snare at 29 while ours is 57, but we get an AE root at 60 *cackles gleefully* <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utalyenatrueheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talyena Trueheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Might be Housebroken</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 12:42:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28055.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stirring up an argument....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cass, all that anger could probably be better channeled into powerleveling a character that you feel would be more useful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Ahhhh, so that is the solution. Quit. Just like so many other druids have done. Well, I for one am not quitting. I have put a lot of time into playing a druid and I refuse to quit the class now. I rember back when rangers were broken. Many quit because of it. But others stuck with the class. They kept telling Verant that the class was broken, and eventually it got fixed. I rember when paladins were broken. Many quit the class because of it. But others stuck with the class. They kept telling Verand the class was broken, and eventually it got fixed. I rember when mages were broken...... I am going to be one of the people telling Verant that our class is broken and not one that quits the class to come back only after it is fixed. And in the mean time, I'm not going to pretend everything is alright either. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustumpsmistrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stumps  Mistrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Puppy</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333399>(8/3/02 1:18:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28055.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stirring up an argument....</span><hr size=1> Tal, im not telling her to quit, just saying that one should have fun, if they arent having fun playing their druid, then play another class that makes them happy.

<br>
I did not change. The game did and while I am able to adapt to almost any situation I cannot change the hard numbers.<br>
<br>
Get ready for a shocking statment....<br>
<br>
Playing an average Druid is easy and why many pick the class but playing a GOOD Druids is hard - one of the hardest classes in the game!<br>
<br>
*waits until the laughter dies down*<br>
<br>
What other class has to know how to be a Wizard, A Clerics, A Chanter, A Shamen ect...?<br>
<br>
I did not pick a Druid because I thought it was easy. I swear to you that I have never quadded (prefer root-dot) and I have spent more time helping others than I have played for myself. What does that get me? It gets the door slammed in my face on raids as no matter how good or nice yadda yadda I may be I'm not the right class!<br>
<br>
How many times will you be placed in the "leftover" group on a raid before you get it.<br>
<br>
What other class has to be able to enter a group and at a drop of a dime switch play style or switch in the middle of a bad pull? Swithc spells in mid-pull because too many were pulled ect...<br>
<br>
I'm still working on being a good Druid. I'll always be - it's the only class I play or will ever play.<br>
<br>
Why am I mad? Because "some" (not all) come to this board and do they help us fix the damn Druid class? No! They say all is well I can solo just fine or group or on raids I just play my other class.<br>
<br>
Bullsh-t!<br>
<br>
I don't have another class! I "was" happy with the Druid Class I played until raid level.<br>
<br>
I thought I was a decent Druid but on large raids I watch my group die on me when I run out of mana due to my horrible mana/heal ratio spells.<br>
<br>
I don't know about you all but when I do get in on a raid I most certainly am NOT going to inform the raid leader what group and classes I prefer or what "I" will do on the raid.<br>
<br>
They slowly changed the rules on Druids and those "Happy Joy Joy" Druids are the very reason Verant can say - "See many Druids love their class - nothing must be wrong just a few "bitter" druids.<br>
<br>
I have provided hard numbers in another thread. The numbers do not lie. Druids have slowly lost power over three years.<br>
<br>
With so many other classes pounding on Druids it's no wonder people get angry when those of our own class go la la la la and play right into their hands.<br>
<br>
So I should petition Verant and provide the facts and figures showing we are broken (yes I said broken and not "slightly unbalanced") at high level, fight our own who are la la la la la everything is fine la la la la or<br>
<br>
GIVE UP????<br>
<br>
Start a "wanted" class and maybe in a year or two (Took me three years to get 60 the way I play) I'll play a high level class that is wanted...<br>
<br>
Maybe EQ will still be around then.<br>
<br>
Maybe the class I picked will get nerfed or broken and if I complain about it people will tell me to start yet another class.<br>

<br>
Why do I need Heal 3 to be in a teir 1 guild?<br>
<br>
Heal 3 was required before they dropped the 10% healing penalty for Druids.<br>
<br>
Now that we heal 10% better (JUST like heal 3) now all the Teir 1 guild have just opened their doors?<br>
<br>
We know this is BS. High end guilds place all kinds of road blocks for Druids because they do not want us. Other classes do not have such restrictions why should we. Why should Druids have to have a zillion alt points to help balance us and even with all these points it still is only an extra 10% healing ability.<br>
<br>
A level 60 is a level 60 and as long as a good player or high standards willing to play by a guild rules applies any "requirements" should be the same for ALL the classes.<br>
<br>
Most high end guilds will take ANY cleric as long as they have CH and are the proper level. No AA points as a Cleric.... NO problem as long as you can click the CH key at the right time. You dont' have your epic as a Cleric - NP we'll get it for you. Missing spells Mr. or Mrs. Cleric NP - we have them in the bank for you.<br>
<br>
Mr. or Mrs. Druid are you level 60 with 50 AA points, have your epic, ALL your spells, all your resists, Keys to every zone in the game?<br>
<br>
We'll consider you. Don't call us we'll call you.<br>

<br>
But in contrast Cas, how fun is it to be just another cleric in the cheal train, to compete w/ over a dozen others of the same class.  <br>
<br>
10% to my heals, thanks.  But I don't want to be a healer, a 2nd rate healer will never be desired over another cleric.  It just aint gonna happen.  Give me the tools to help the raid like all other classes.  All melee, wizards, necro's etc.  We have less then a handfull of buffs that everyone might want, but don't less us fall out of range on damage.  <br>
<br>
Remember what was necessary for hybrids?  Rangers/Pallys/Sk's did crap for damage, thus people stoped playing them.  Everyone started a warrior, then monk, then rogue.  And when new servers opened up, almost no new hybrid players.  People still play druids because we are fun  I'll never give up my druid.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather I stuck w/ my monk at this point though.  I've got over 160 days played and started when EQ hit the door.  If I stuck w/ my monk I started that day, I know I'd be more helpful on every raid I went on. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65433>fris</a>

It takes about 6 months to a year to see the effect. The "most" wanted class two years ago was the Enchanter. (this was when Rangers, SK's and Rogues were broken)<br>
<br>
Everyone rushed to make one and now chanters are alot more in number.<br>
<br>
A year ago Mages and to a lessor extent Druids were broken and everyone started to create Monks and Rogues.<br>
<br>
But monks and rogues stack pretty well so I do not see that as much of an issue. <p>Cassea Maidenwolf<BR>

Do you know what makes me happy?  Seeing our suggestions to help our class slowly get implemented.<br>
<br>
It didn't happen because we all sat here singing kumbaya and saying how great Druids are and how we are perfectly fine.<br>
<br>
Just remember, its people like Cassea that got the 10% penalty removed, fixed Moonfire, got Moonfire and MoS dropping off more than one mob, and the other little changes we've seen.<br>
<br>
It wasn't the &quot;I'm perfectly happy with my crap @#%$ druid, doing crap @#%$ things&quot; crowd.  It was the bitter ones who gathered the info, made the suggestions, and are slowly (very very slowly...needs to be faster) watching the fixes roll in.<br>
<br>
So before you suggest they need to play another class, or that they are wrong...look at what rewards <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have reaped because of the Bitter crowd. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24579">
