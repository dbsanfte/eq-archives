This is what I found:<br>
<br>
1-7 - Misty Thicket.  If you don't start there (woodelf?) then try to get there ASAP and ask if a caster would be kind enough to bind you in Rivervale.  Then just kill, kill, kill - it's constant killing there, and nowhere near as crowded as Greater Faydark :)<br>
If you can't or won't twink, baking is very good in these levels.  I made fish fillets and sold them for my leather armor, which I was fully equipped in by level 8 :)<br>
<br>
8-10 - Get to Butcherblock, get bound in Kaladim, and returm to the boat.  When you zone into the ocean, hop off at the first set of rocks - you will see 3 goblins that are uncamped like 99% of the time!  They are good exp, and always drop a bow that is worth something very reasonable like 3 gold or so.  Use harmony to pull them singly to the little flat area at the back of the island.  Keep killing until you are so encumbered from bows that you can hardly walk, then gate back to Kaladim to sell.  Repeat.<br>
<br>
11-14 - First, get a magical weapon of some sort.  Velium is reasonably priced.  Then journey forth to Qeynos, and don't forget to use your camouflage spell to get past Highpass and the Karanas.  Head to the docks in South Qeynos, and get bound there (or bind back at the gates if you have to).  The boat takes you to Erudin, but hop off when it stops at the island in the middle of the ocean.  Here you will find a reasonable number of willowisps to kill for decent exp and very good loot.  Beware of the madmen though.  Unless you are at 100% when you get attacked by one at lvl 10-12, just gate and head back to the docks :P  Otherwise you will be doing that anyway, but without any clothes.  The casters *hurt*.<br>
Do not restrict yourself to searching for wisps, or it will take you a long time to level if there are other people hunting them.  The snakes drop Giant Snake Fangs that sell for 4-5gp each, and the vampire bats there are very odd - they usually have about 5 giant wings ;)  You can't use them for Levitate, but you can sell em.<br>
<br>
15-24 - Lake Rathe.  Harmony is your friend, because then you're not restricted to the single spawn :)  You'll probably find you can kill yellow cons here.  It's excellent EXP and reasonable loot... I was there until 24, when I got wolfform and trotted off elsewhere.<br>
You could also go to Lake of Ill Omen in Kunark, if you don't mind crowded areas.  But Lake Rathe is pretty uncamped nowadays, so I prefer it.<br>
<br>
25-29 - The dwarven rogue guards Kyte and Ronin in Butcherblock.  You can find them by heading from the druid ring towards the sea, and following that area with the water on your left.  You can't really miss them.<br>
Use harmony, pull one, use snare+nuke tactics to kill him, then med up and do it with the other one.<br>
When your faction drops a stage, just kill the nearby bandits (Pegleg and friends) to get it back up, thereby losing no faction at all.<br>
Safe, reasonable EXP... not the greatest loot.  Usually uncamped.<br>
It might be a bit awkward at 25 - I seem to recall running out of mana and having to med-kite occasionally, or having one resist snare over and over.  Usually it's just an awkward higher level spawn - zone to Dagnors to get rid of the hate, and you might actually find something to hunt in there until someone of a higher level gets rid of them.<br>
Try not to let the guards get close enough to hit you.  They hit hard and fast.  You'll be glad for the *wonderful* healing spell you get at 29 to patch up any little mishaps like this :)<br>
<br>
30-32 - Lake of Ill Omen, near the windmill.  I'm pretty sure that's where I was, killing the likes of goblins.<br>
<br>
33-35 - Frontier Mountains.  Kill the Gorging Brutes, the weaker goblins, Mountain Giants and Burynai.  Avoid the casting goblins at all costs - if you see one running for you, then it's time to make tracks!<br>
<br>
36+?  Well, I'm only level 36, so this is about as far as I can say.  During these levels I would either hunt stuff in OverThere, kill spiders in Firiona Vie, or grab Velious and go to the Great Divide to hunt Tizmaks. <p>-- <br>

<br>
Lake Rathe (19-23?)  Get a single melee partner at the 3 spawn of aviak guards, initially break with harmony, stagger spawn, standard hunting from then on, think it was about a level every 3 hours, went from 20ish to 23 in one night, loved it.<br>
<br>
Lake of Ill Omen (45-49)  Bloodgill Goblins... Quad em, they have about 1300 health, easy to kill even before the new AoE at 49...  Pulling them is a bit tricky...<br>
<br>
Quick Guide to pulling Goblins in LOIO...  First find them, they are underwater in the lake in LOIO.  Pull from the corners of the stone building that is in the water.  Bring lots of fish scales and bat wings... Buff with Lev, EB, and Wolf.  Run down, get between 2 spawns that are close together (survey the area first, you'll see that the building is not quite a square, so 2 corners are closer to each other)  Get one in one corner targeted, get as close to the next corner as possible but still able to cast on the one you have targeted, cast (not snare, I used the lvl 1 DD) then swim forward a bit, cast on next corner, swim straight up to surface and get up levitating, or you'll be in trouble...  Make sure you don't lose em, if you did it right you should have all 4 with you, don't out-range them in the water though.  When on shore, snare them.  Do not snare them before they hit land...  And be careful of people hunting or medding on shore... I dunno if they won't agro on them because I never got close enoug to anyone.  Spawn time is about 16 minutes I think... You have a chance to get a Harpoon of the Depths (Worth 400-1500 depending on server) I think it only spawns in one of the corners...  Anyway, good hunting to you, sorry if guide is poorly written, it's 7:15 AM and I haven't slept yet.<br>
<br>
Those are the only 2 areas that truly stand out as places I would definately want to visit on a new char.<br>
<br>
(btw, if you can, grab a monk friend and treat him to some nice exp (for the bloodgill goblins) it's almost the same exp as quad kiting, and you get company  (plus you're less likely to trample other people)  be careful about Enduring Breath tho)  Me (47) and my friend (monk 45) were able to do all 4 corners with 2 minutes to spare, I didn't use DS, just SLD Chloro and Wolf... <p>Baekk Windancer <Pax Familla> - 49th Level Druid of Erollisi Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uginwen2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ginwen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/23/01 7:12:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members5.clubphoto.com/robert329671/Mar_27_2001/photo2.jpg?1 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a druid's favorite hunting places</span><hr size=1> Great job on the guides peeps<br>

Level 20 - 30 : LOIM. Ok, at that time it was not as crowded as it is now :(<br>
<br>
Level 45 - 52 : DL. The place is sometimes crowded but at least when you die you have no problem finding a cleric :)<br>
<br>
Level 52 - 55 : Burning Woods. I almost never went across anyone there :)<br>

<br>
Here is what i did:<br>
I am wood elf druid now lvl 44<br>
I didnt do much soloing until later levels (FYI)<br>
<br>
Lvl 1-9 Newbie Area Gfay, Orc Hill, Crushbone<br>
<br>
Lvl 9-14 Butcher Block, 9-10 Goblin Camps (I think i was this level) 11-14 2 places.. Chessboard ( camped alot ) or My fav place was the dwarves near docks (Pegleg, Qued, etc.. )I got a warrior partner and it was pretty easy pulling with sweet exp...<br>
<br>
Lvl 14-17 Oasis (Orc group) or Lavastorm (Elementals)<br>
<br>
Lvl 17-20 Highpass Hold Orc group or Gnoll group<br>
<br>
Lvl 20-24 I switched between Lake Rathe and South karana ( Gnolls / Aviaks )<br>
<br>
Lvl 25-30 LOIO (Sarnark Fortress) Frontier Mountains (Giants) and Warslick Woods ( Giant Camp ) I soloed giants in WW with ease pulling 1 at time. I even got a loop out of it too =)<br>
<br>
Lvl 30-36 The Overthere - Can solo or group (I prefer group) AWSOME exp either way. AT night watch out for those dragoons<br>
<br>
Lvl 36-43 Eastern Wastes in Velious - A few options here. Solo Animals, Quad Ulthorks(war/hunt/Walruses), group at Rygor Orc camp ( GOOD loot ) even can zone in Crystal Caves and get a queen/terror group. Quading Ulthorks I found the best exp. <br>
<br>
Lvl 40-44 I was bored with EW so I went to Dreadlands and soloed Tundra Yeti's in the yeti cave. I went here at 42 and all blues with some green. Im now 44 and some blue with more greens, so you could prob head here around 40. <br>
<br>
And as for Lvl 44+ I have no idea where im going now.. Maybe Great Divide or Karnors Castle or somewhere.. Havent decided yet. Anyone have any ideas.. ?<br>
<br>
Well Thats it .. I hope this helps ya out some. <br>
Peace<br>

They are susceptible to Terrorize Animal and drop tusks worth 9 PP to the right merchants.  There are often several groups hunting them, but with tracking druids get more than our share.<br>
<br>
There's not much in the zone that is dangerous to us at those levels, save Tundra Jack and Iceberg and the guards if one is in wolf form.  And the madman Martar Icebear wanders around looking for people to kill, but he's slow like all barbarians.<br>
<br>
The icy orcs can also be hunted, but seem pretty magic resistant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaelwr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelwr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/19/01 3:18:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a druid's favorite hunting places:  Everfrost</span><hr size=1>  How to hunt Unrest or how I spent my summer vacation.<br>
<br>
 Unrest was my vacation home from 24 (wolf form spell required) untill it greened out. I went other places to group but I always returned there when I solo hunted. At 24 harmony pull from the lower floor, when that starts to green out go upstairs and hunt the hallways, closets, and you can even harmony and pull from the fireplace room if you have cleared the hall spawns first. After I knew the pathing upstairs I just fought up there so as not to get adds pulling through the downstairs area. I pulled for groups many times there even with my Mage just because I knew it so well. After you get bored with the upstairs go to the basement. There are 2 spawns just below the stairs you can again harmonize and pull one to the top of the stairs to fight. Then do the other one. After that isn't challenging go do the torture room. Harmonize and pull the skele's first because they don't always respond to harmony as well (maybe their aggro range is just larger). Hags harmonize easy as do the werebats. Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 harmonies to get everything if the room is at full spawn. If the passageway from the TR to the ghost is free you can solo in there very easily at the right levels, there are 2 single spawns and a wanderer first then the bloodpool area has two. You can again harmonize and single pull here after the hallway is clear (watch for the wanderer if you haven't killed him earlier he will go through this area). The pit traps on either side of the bloodpool each have a fungii in them, they can be fought one at a time easily at 35. When this isn't challenging enough you can hunt the Ghost and keep tracking up for the Bartender, Knight, and Ghoul Magii upstairs for variety. I kept my whole guild supplied with the goodies from Unrest for a long time. LD is the biggest killer here because you lose wolf form and everything will aggro on you so try to meditate in a clear area. At lower levels I meditated outside later I meditated in the areas I had cleared and knew would not respawn for a while. The Hags and Knight (harm touch) are always fun but the first time you can solo the Ghost is a special feeling. He breaks root often and always gets in a few good hits on you. Snare is required here as any runers will bring quick death on you. Any wanderers you haven't cleared will aggro on you if you are fighting so you have to learn the pathing. Also watch the Tenticle Terrors here, they do a knockback spell which can get you into lots of trouble so try to keep your back to a wall fighting them. <br>
<br>
Well I hope someone can use this to have as much fun as I did in my vacation home. Say hello to the Hags in there I am sure they miss my visits.<br>

<br>
10 - 15 A little bit of Butcherblock, kiting, and a couple of levels of Steamfont - the drakes, harpies, and elementals near the mino caves (behind the windmills) were awesome exp around level 14<br>
<br>
15 - 20 Oasis - if you can handle the annoying shouting morons, kill stealing, and crappy loot<br>
<br>
20 - 30 South Karana, at first the aviaks and then the gnolls - first truly good loot so far<br>
<br>
30 - 40 the Overthere, crappy loot again but rockin' exp.  Kind of a pain to get to, though.  A good place to kite is in the corner of the zone between the FM and SF zones, med on the hillside and the goons rarely come there unless trained.<br>
<br>
40 - 49 Dreadlands, but looking for somewhere better atm.  I usually kite on the ledge/hillside right next to the FM zone - lots of mobs around and don't have to worry about accidentally training anyone with my kites.  Occasional accidental KS'ing, though, of pullers from the wall.<br>

<br>
I did most of 53 quading man o wars.  The ry-gorr elites are still good exp at 54 and easy to harmony pull.<br>
<br>
Nice big zone, lots of things to do.<br>
<br>
I know a lot of druids around 40 that hunt giants, orcs, Ulthork warriors and hunters, Walrus  and do well.  <br>
<br>
Lots of animal types also.<br>
<br>
GD is also good.  The frost giant berserkers give good exp til about 51.  Scouts are a bit lower.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW Nymue, there is a giant hut south of karnors on the ice flow desert line near the zone wall.

<br>
If your moving there to avoid server downage from the live servers you're going to be sorely dissapointed. We (of Test) are down substantially more than any of the production servers. Once everyone is back from E3 we're expecting to go back to our standard server down schedule, multiple times a day, for anywhere from 1 min to and hour (standard, with some of those downs lasting upwards of 4 to 8 hours).<br>
<br>
Just thought I would warn you, we're down a lot more than the lives and only some of that time do we get a warning (used to be no warning just "You've been disconnected")<br>
