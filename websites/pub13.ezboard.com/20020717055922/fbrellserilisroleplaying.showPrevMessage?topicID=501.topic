Slate UPDATED!!!</span><hr size=1> &quot;I will rid the land of another infamous villain!&quot; shouts Seargant Slate as he thrusts his sword into the abdomen of some unnamed Dark Elf. He took delight in seeing the look of pain and agony on the young shadow knights face. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;Slain while you sell...&quot; he whispered softly to the young shadow knight.  &quot;You didn't  expect that did you? Perhaps you thought it would be while while vanquishing one of your enemies? Or maybe betrayed by one of your fickle guildmates?&quot; Slate snickers to himself. &quot;Like this.. it's almost an accident for you. Ha! You might as well have choked on a biscuit as you ate!&quot;<br>
<br>
These were the last words the young shadow knight heard. These words and the gleeful cackles of the corrupt guard of the East Commonlands. <br>
<br>
Seargant Slate stands over the crumpled corpse. &quot;See?!?!? Slain!! No one will stand in my path! No one!&quot; Slates battle fury turns to sadness as he notices the wedding ring on the finger of the slain shadow knight.<br>
<br>
Slate begins to sniffle to himself... &quot;S-see? All of you!&quot; &lt;sniff sniff&gt; &quot;You'll all feel my pain&quot; &lt;sniff sniff&gt; Slate takes out his little pink handkerchief. &lt;Blows his nose, begins to sob softly&gt;<br>
&quot;Thus is my life.. &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Seargant Slate?....&quot; says Guard Reskin, in seeing a troubled Seargant Slate. &quot;Are  you ok?&quot; Slate quickly stuffs his handkerchief back into the fold of his uniform. &quot;Ahrm...  Ah.. yes.. uhh.. I'm fine... &quot; Slate quickly turns to a stern voice. &quot;And Why are you not on your rounds??!?!&quot;<br>
Reskin is slightly taken aback by the moodiness of Slate. &quot;I'm sorry sir! I'll resume them now.. I was just seeing if you were O.K.&quot; Slate points toward the path. &quot;Get on your way!&quot;<br>
<br>
Reskin shrugs, and turns around, to resume his  rounds. Reskin seems happy go lucky. He has a pleantness about him, and he was obviously  happy. Slate had noticed that Reskin had been much happier since  he began talking about his own &quot;special someone.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Look at yourself Reskin!&quot; Slate said to Reskin. &quot;You and whoever your significant other... All Happy-Go-Lucky... Not a care in the world huh? You are weak. It diverts your attention. You don't concentrate on your job. Bah!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, sir......I'll try to be less happy,&quot; replies Reskin.<br>
&quot; - How long has it been since she left sir?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silence yourself before i speak to you in another way.. with my sword. Leave me now!&quot; Slate screamed at Reskin.<br>
<br>
Reskin quickly resumes his rounds.. swaggering just a bit it seems. Almost as though he thinks he is better than Slate since he has his own significant other.  Slate's thoughts turn to his memories of love lost. &quot;Oh Shanaenae...where are you now?&quot; The hardened  soldier  says quietly to himself. &quot;How long has it been  since i held you in my arms Shanaenae? 10 years?&quot; Slate remembers the old times with his Erudite lover. Although it was a secret relationship, he was prepared to make it open, but Shanaenae left him. &lt;sniff sniff&gt;  &quot;I-if only I had been more open sooner!<br>
Shanaenaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&quot;<br>
<br>
Slate takes out his little handkerchief again, and wipes away his tears as they leave  small streaks down his dirty face. He picks up his helm again and puts it back on. &quot;If  i can't have my Erudite lover..&quot; Slate says to himself,&quot; No one will love.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then, Slate sees a mid aged Paladin, running along the path.  &quot;Have at thee!&quot; screams Slate as he engages the paladin. The paladin immediately turns and begins to run, with Slate in tow. &quot;SLATE TO TUNNEL!&quot; screams the paladin, as Slate thinks to himself, &quot;finally.. i will know the location of the tunnel in which many people hide... they will know my wrath!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;DON'T BRING SLATE TO TUNNEL&quot; are the screams of other people, but the young paladin stays on course. Slate can see it now.. a tunnel in the mountains. The paladin runs in the tunnel just as Slate catches him and shoves his blade through the crevices of the young paladins armor. He falls immediately. Slate then looks to all of the people around him. He sneers.  The first 2 people he see are two young newlyweds - a young cleric and a paladin. &quot;You will die!&quot; screams Slate as he runs at them. The young paladin gets in front of his bride, ready to give his life for her. Though the paladin is no match for Slate, he fights valiantly... just as he is about to be slain,  his bride heals him. It is an epic battle... Slates hate versus the love of the 2 newlyweds.. who refuse to let each other die.  Amidst the battle, seeing their bond softens Slates heart for a moment, and in that weakness, the young cleric bride hits Slate in the  head with a club. He is knocked unconscious, and slumps to the ground. <br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
Bright light. Bright white light.  <br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; .... &quot;shhhhhh...be quiet...all is well...&quot;says another voice... &quot;Shanaenae?!?!! is that you?&quot; says Slate. &quot;Yes, it's me Lenny.&quot;  replies Shanaenae.  Slate says, &quot;Oh how i've missed you.. what are you doing here?&quot;  &quot;I'm  here to tell you not to hate love.. you're going to destroy yourself by your own hate. Embrace love. be a loving person. I may be gone, but all is not lost for you.&quot;  <br>
&quot;But why are you HERE though? and why do you sound a little like Sigmund Freud?&quot;  Shanaenae replies, &quot; I dunno.. it's YOUR dream.. eesh. And your subconscious is whacked out. &quot;<br>
&quot;But i ..............................................&quot; &lt;things get dim&gt;<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
As Slate comes back to consciousness, he hears faint voces in the background, that get louder as he comes around. The headache is unbearable. He feels the bandages that are wrapped all around his head. He must've sustained a good shot from the cleric. <br>
<br>
&quot;Joo  is  lucky tuh be alibe..&quot; says what seems to be a females voice to Slate. &quot;Dat beez a bad hit on yoo head.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; says Reskin,&quot;  you are lucky to be alive sir. This young lady saved your life. She dragged you from the tunnel.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Whoever  you are, dear woman, i owe you my life. What ever can i do to repay you? You name it. ANYTHING.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Me'z want a hubband. Sumbudy too lub. Will joo marry me'z?&quot;<br>
&quot;Absolutely  dear woman. I will do anything for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Slate begins to remove his bandages from his head to see his new lover, Reskin says, &quot; Oh , by the way sir, i've brought my speacial someone here to meet  you.. so be nice..&quot; <br>
Reskin giggles. <br>
<br>
As Slate removes the final bandage, he looks up to see a large ogre woman with lips puckered toward him - his new lover. Slate turns white as he turns to see Guard Tolus has arrived. He looks around and says to  Reskin. Where is  your special someone..  &quot;Sir.. &quot; says Reskin... Just then,  Slate looks down and notices  Reskin and Tolus - HOLDING HANDS.<br>
<br>
Slate turns and looks at the ogre. Turns and looks at his guards. Turns and looks at the ogre, turnes and looks at his guards. <br>
<br>
&quot;SOMEONE NUKE ME PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot;<br>
