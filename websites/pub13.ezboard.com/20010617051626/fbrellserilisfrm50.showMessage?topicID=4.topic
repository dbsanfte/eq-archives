The goal is to have, in 1 week's time, a concise list of problems with the Nag/Vox Rotation, and potential solutions for them.<br>
<br>
REMEMBER!  The system in place must be good enough to EVERYONE that all are willing to abide by it.  Keep in mind that if there is no good solution, it means the rotation will likely become FCFS.  Also keep in mind that that FCFS is also a valid option, and CAN work if people are willing to respect each other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uauserpentsonoblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AuSerpent Sonoblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://170.141.132.151/bboard/snote.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 7:53:58 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://170.141.132.151/bboard/dnote.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> I think Naggy/Vox has worked well.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can see as a problem is those names/guilds on the list that are no longer around when thier time comes up.  Maybe there could be some sort of &quot;check-in&quot; rule when you are next on the list.  If you don't check in then you are skipped when it becomes your turn.  Just a suggestion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uphazy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phazy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 8:37:57 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> Only thing I would like to see is a accounting of the people killig the mob.<br>
<br>
A) When your in the top 5 of the list ..once a week YOU are responsible to posting you are still planning to take your turn (this will only impact the mods a little..would be in its own area..they can check it once a week on a set date..If they dont have an post from a person ..they post ONE thread asking for a confirmation...and if the person does not post to it..in a set time. They are removed.) If it looks like it would be more of a problem for the mods..it could probably be simplified some.<br>
<br>
B) And i also believe each guild should hold one spot on ALL dragon rotations.(if suggestion c is taken ..both together would speed up the lists and everyone would come back around sooner)<br>
<br>
C) Indys prob should not be kept on raid Dragon rotation. I hated to bring that up, but its just something that seems right. If you are an indy...and doing a dragon ..odds are you are bringing friends form guilds..why not be part of that  guild...(this from someone who ran Fear as an indy..and wishes he had done it as a guild..as I had most spots filled from 2 guilds I do alot with.. then joined another guild 2 days later.<br>
<br>
D) the idea of FCFS on atleast naggy/vox is scary to me. they are dragons that need a specific lvl of people to take..and for people to get pick up groups for them....will make taking them down much harder. And i think the point should be making sure they die as fast as possible. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uphazy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phazy</A> at: 4/23/01 8:39:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burn the Witch!

<br>
1.) Because of the extended rotation, &amp; the level cap, Nag/Vox raiders are often higher than 52 by the time their turn comes around.  This leads to people signing up for the dragons before they're ready &amp; actually extending the list, aggravating the problem.<br>
<br>
2.) Because more experienced raiders leave Nag/Vox behind when they hit 52, many guilds that CAN raid Nag/Vox lack the leadership &amp; experience to lead a successful raid.<br>
<br>
3.) Any guild that has active players will have a difficulty maintaining a L47-52 player base.  To kill the dragons, you need a variety of classes.  Guilds have a VERY difficult time providing any significant portion of the people needed.<br>
<br>
A significant portion of the names on Nag &amp; Vox are invalid.  They're people that signed up just to get their shot.  Their capability of leading a successful raid is marginal, and heavily depends on signups.<br>
<br>
In several cases, the guild has their name on the list so they can &quot;claim&quot; a drop off the dragon.<br>
<br>
That is why things must change.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My proposal for the old world dragons.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
My vision for Nagafen &amp; Vox is a place where people of the appropriate level can sign up NOW to do the dragons NOW.  Not six months down the road, but at the present time.  It's a place where the people with the experience &amp; knowledge to kill the dragons can meet with the various people that will help them make it happen.  It's not based on guild tag, but on cooperation.  It will involve everyone that's interested in dropping the dragons, &amp; is of the appropriate level.<br>
<br>
I want to see things like they were when Nag/Vox first fell on Brell.  Where all people interested &amp; of the appropriate level got together &amp; made it happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Changes:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1.) The rotation will be removed.  Too many guilds/Indy's on the list are no longer valid for a Nag/Vox killing.  They lack the resources in guild to pull it off.  Very few guilds (If any at all) have even HALF the people required (47-52) to make for a successful Nagafen/Vox raid.  This means that people are on the list for selfish &amp; exclusive reasons.  They want to claim loot, or they want to take only their select group, excluding others.<br>
<br>
2.)  In it's place, a forum be created.  In this forum, the leaders with the experience to kill Nag/Vox can coordinate with the people that can &amp; want to kill them.  In this forum, the leaders can post that they will be taking a raid to kill the dragons.  If multiple leaders are interested at the same time, they can pool their forces together.  The emphasis is on cooperation, and server effort, not on individual guilds.  The raids belong to the server, not any guild.<br>
<br>
3.)  Loot claiming will not be permitted.  Raids will be run for the good of the server, and to give people the experience of killing a dragon.<br>
<br>
4.) An ever changing &quot;Dragon killing community&quot; will be formed.  As people level past 52, they will leave the community.  As people come into the 47-52 range, they will enter the community.<br>
<br>
The goal is to pool resources as a server, for the good of the server.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Advantages</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
*People can participate in an open dragon raid, without skewed loot rolls.<br>
*The leaders can coordinate with the people who can help them kill dragons.<br>
*Raiders can obtain the information they need on gear, resist, tactics from experienced leaders, to lead SUCCESSFUL raids.<br>
*Vox WILL drop consistently, because the experience, and the people can get together &amp; have good raids.  The white scale will become far less of an issue for raids.<br>
*People won't need to STAY 52 to raid a dragon, because the chance will ALWAYS be there.  People will no longer have to wait for &quot;Their guild&quot; to get a shot at a dragon.<br>
<br>
I feel this type of system is much more in the &quot;Spirit of Brell&quot;.  It's one of cooperation, and mutual support.<br>
<br>
I will actively support this system by de-levelling Adun down to 52, &amp; helping to lead raids on Nagafen &amp; Vox.  I feel that actively supporting this, &amp; showing that it can work is the best way of bringing in a new era of cooperation on a server wide basis on Brell.  Because of the server side filtering changes, dragon raids CAN take too many people, &amp; not be doomed.  It's no longer critical that un-needed classes be excluded for reasons of lag.  There is space to include many.<br>
<br>
After a raid, the raid leaders will post about the raid, about who won what items, and any problems they encountered.  This way, the community can celebrate with the people that have won very special items.  Future raids can learn from the problems that the raid came accross.  The raid's makeup is apparent, so future raids can respectfully request that people not &quot;hog&quot; the raids.  I KNOW that we can share resources like the dragons without an extensive, out of date list that doesn't truly represent the L47-52 population anymore.<br>
<br>
I volunteer to serve as a moderator in the forum, along with 2 or 3 other people.  These people should be willing to help facilitate successful dragon raids, &amp; assist raid leaders with the problems of leading these raids.  If possible, these moderators should have a character L50-52 that they can keep at that level, as to actively  help dragon raids.<br>
<br>
The L47-52 population is always changing, and it's a special one.  Most of the people entering this population are inexperienced with raiding.  Many of them don't have the gear or experience they need.  The goal of the system is to assist these people in experiencing a unique experience in Everquest, and learning in the process.  Very few guilds have a core of stable 47-52 players they can count on to form the base for a solid dragon raid.  Any guild that does, likely won't 3 months down the line.<br>
<br>
These dragons require a unique solution that fits the situation, while still preserving the spirit of our server.  If the community is willing, I will work with a few other volunteers in making this happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uquemnwyndrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quemn Wyndrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Assist Dammit!</span><br>  Posts: 744<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 9:26:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> well i know that Evoluxa is a guild that has no problem with people 45-52, thats where our main area is. we've got like 3-4 clerics around that level. but i see a lot of guilds passing 52 before their turn comes up like you say. i think a forum would be a good idea, and i'll join in helpin out with it with you Adun, if you like. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uphazy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phazy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 9:35:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> Adune<br>
   interseting ideas. I would be interested in helping out as much as possible(I dont have as much xp as some..but do have Shrubby 51 druid that wont be leveling so could be of use).<br>
<br>
Only issue I see as a sticking point for most to accept this is ...Who says who is allowed to lead a raid. Some people may think person X is a good leader, and others may not....the subjective part of this is the area I see the opition will come from.<br>

<br>
I think if people were willing to follow this system, it could work great. Unfortunately, I don't know that I have enough faith in human nature to see this work right.<br>
<br>
I'm about to hit 52, and I've only been on one dragon raid in my entire career. The rotation is not working for one of the exact reasons stated. By the time someone's name comes up on the list, most of the people who it was intended before are past 52nd level. I had pretty much given up hope on getting to participate in a successful old-world dragon raid (Vox didn't go down the one time I participated).<br>
<br>
I believe that they should NOT be FFA or FCFS, but what we have isn't really working. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufaera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faera</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://ravenous.disassociative.net/faeraicon.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 10:14:02 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> I like the idea of only being able to sign up for one dragon at a time, and ONLY when you/your guild are ready for it.  However, while I know alot of people think Indy raids are just a way for big guilds to get 2 signups, I don't neccessarily think its fair to penalize everyone who isn't in a guild just because one guy did this once. <br>
<br>
However, unless some new system is proposed for the leading of a raid, I guess I disagree about the no loot claiming.  Running one of these raids is an expensive and time consuming task.  Given that fact, I think a guild should have the option to claim ONE (and JUST ONE) item, as well as cash loot, to compensate for their troubles.  <br>
<br>
As a side note, I think Adun's offer to de-level is an impressive and honorable one.  Its easy to sit at lvl 60 (or whatever lvl) and dictate stuff that doesn't apply to you. Getting down in the dirt and dealing with it is a really generous show of faith. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugaennenfizzlewhiff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaennen Fizzlewhiff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 762<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 11:31:58 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.jacksonville.net/~jshannon/images/Gaennen2-ico.GIF height=75 width=75></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> I have been behind keeping Vox/Naggy reserved but what Adune says makes sense here.

<br>
I think FCFS would be kind of difficult to stage as well on these because it does take some planning and there's not a guild on the server who has a force the right level to accomplish this.  I think Adune has a pretty good solution here, one that will keep the dragons dead and keep people raiding.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burn the Witch!

Adun, are you are basically saying guilds sign up so they can claim loot in order to benefit themselves?<br>

If so, Please speak for yourself and not put that on all of Brell's guilds. If I am wrong, forgive me. Maybe I am reading that wrong... Perhaps it should say &quot;some guilds&quot;<br>

***All guilds do not do this. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Some might just be looking to claim expensive items</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, yet others might just get a kick outta actually just killing something big, and yes, Vox and Naggy dragons are still pretty big to some of us.***<br>
<br>
I'm actually looking forward to reserving FG raids for our guild members who are just getting into their 40's and assisting them in learning what raids are like. That's what my friends did for me and I learned ALOT.<br>
<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
We just had a helluva time with server outtages and such, but Naggy died despite Verants servers... We included all sorts of people from all sorts of guilds, claimed nothing but pride of accomplishment. <br>
<br>
I don't think the whole dragon reservation system was too bad, and I'm just not sure what a FCFS would be like. It's all very weird. Are we going to become a server of large guilds to compete with each other? <br>

Your guild is perfect, right now to be killing dragons.  Unfortunately, our current reservation system prevents that.  Unless the leaders in your guild decide NOT to level, the people that are capable of leading a dragon raid will be over 52.  As well, a good portion of your guild's actively playing core will be over 52 by the time your slot comes around.<br>
<br>
Critical to us moving forward with good change here is the recognition that Vox &amp; Nag are special mobs that are like no other, due to the level cap, and a base minimum of level 45 or so.<br>
<br>
In a FCFS environment, Nag &amp; Vox would be raided by a lot of mostly pickup crews. Problems would be exclusion of people, lack of solid leadership &amp; experience, and the potential for some groups to hog the dragons.<br>
<br>
What I want to see is a free system that has the help of some moderators.  People that aren't just dictating who does what, but actively helping people to go out &amp; kill the dragons themselves.  Making sure people have the knowledge required, the equipment to be sucessful, and the appropriate tactics.  They'd also serve as parents of sorts.  Billy, you've had 3 turns now, it's time to give Jane a shot.  And James, Sarah, you both want to lead a raid.  We'd like to help you do that together.<br>
<br>
I want a person to be able to indicate their interest at L45, obtain the gear needed, join a raid as an observer at 45, then join a raid later at 47 or so as a participant.  As they level, I want them to be able to help the next set of L45's as they're 50-52.  At the end, you have a solid core of people that have successfully raided a dragon several times, perhaps even obtaining a special item.  When they come out, they have learned how to raid, how to help lead raids, and have cooperated with their fellow Brellians in a momentus task.<br>
<br>
As well, I'd like to bring in a few people that are L55+ each raid.  To help buff, help coordinate, &amp; get to know people.  I've been astounded when talking to lower level people about some of the attitudes towards the higher level guilds.  In the end, we're all human beings, and we genuinely want people to like us, and be our friends.  A positive experience with someone from say Watchers, Enshadowed, or SR as people enter their raiding levels will do wonders a few months down the road, when people have the choice to work something out, or fight it out.<br>
<br>
The attitudes formed by this sort of exercise WILL preserve the spirit of Brell in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubificus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bificus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.flspot.com/loa/mb/loa_iconsm.gif WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=17 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 215<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 12:44:19 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your guild is perfect, right now to be killing dragons.

Actually the way it went, we have had our chance at both Naggy and Vox with our guild's active under 53 people participating under the current reservation system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burn the Witch!

32 &amp; 30 names on Nag &amp; Vox respectively.  At an average of 7 days per kill (More due to guilds not killing as soon as he pops, less due to servers going down) that's over 7 months.<br>

Seven months ago, my monk Adune didn't even exist.  For most people out there, seven months is far too long to wait on a list for a mob that has a L52 cap. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 4/23/01 1:16:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubificus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bificus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.flspot.com/loa/mb/loa_iconsm.gif WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=17 BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 217<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 1:16:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> Our first joining the rotations was in December.

But there's also alot of time put into the organization, more time than I personally would ever be able to invest.  I put my faith in the raid leaders, in how they form groups, budget the raid's time, thier tactics, and how they choose to distribute their loot, because without them, I wouldn't be taking the dragons down at all. <br>
<br>
I think its fine to stress that claiming loot isn't encouraged, but I feel like its a mistake to start putting such strict regulations on the raids.  If people don't like a given raid leader's methods (which SHOULD be required to be stated up-front), they can choose not to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uomenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Omenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/23/01 1:20:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What does the future hold: Nagafen/Vox</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1.)

And that's to be expected, nothing we can do about it. It gives a chance to those from 49-52 that aren't in a guild that's in the rotation or aren't in a guild at all to attend a dragon slaying. Why do all things have to be &quot;guild only&quot;. What's wrong with having the leader and 3 other people be from the guild, and 38 other sign-ups and friends?<br>

<br>
Agreed.. but. My raid on Vox a while ago was like that too. We had 4 people from Valorblade at the raid. Two of those being 53+. Yet we took her down with not problems and only 2 casualties. One from Vox herself and one from someone getting feared into the bear pit. And we did it on the first day our notification was posted. What's so wrong with that?<br>
<br>
<br>
My opinion: Leave it as it is. It's fine!<br>
<br>
If you're going to take off the rotation, at least let my guild pass through first so I have a chance at finishing my epic. This is basically my last chance to ever finish it. I'm not in a powerful guild. I can't get the people to kill Talendor or Sev. Naggy is the only way I'm finishing this quest. And now you're going to take that away.<br>

Adune,<br>
<br>
I think that you have an interesting proposal going for nag/vox, and I'm of two minds...<br>
<br>
It's possible that this turbulent time is the exact right time to try something this radical.  If it doesn't work out then we can either go back to the ol' list, or just fcfs on vox/naggy.<br>
<br>
However, I think I'm slightly more of the persuasion that the dragons aren't as broken as other parts of the system.  Let's tend to the patient's lack of respiration and leave the broken toe until we're pretty sure that it's going to survive.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Your proposal is indeed intriguing, and does have a great deal of merit. It is true that I put my guild on the list long before we were ready, knowing that much time would pass before we had to worry about it. However, my guildmates have been uncooperative and have been leveling like mad to the point that we are almost ready now, despite few of us having experience with dragon raids or even raids in general.<br>
<br>
For your idea to work you will need a lot of cooperation, and frankly I feel that it goes against most people's nature to cooperate and participate in something when there is little reward for doing so. I personally would love the satisfaction of leading a successful raid to kill a dragon. But am I ever going to get that chance? Probably not, regardless of my experience and skills I am not well known in the Brell community and therefore will likely not be considered to take a leadership role.<br>
<br>
So what do we do about that? Obviously many people want to participate in raids, but what of those that want to LEAD raids? I did not sign up on the list so that I could get phat lewtz, I signed up so that I could lead my guild and friend guilds on a successful dragon raid. I signed up so that I could say &quot;Children of the Mother killed Vox and Nagafen.&quot; Yes, I want the Cloak of Flames, and yes I want the red dragonscale, but I will roll for it just like anyone else.<br>
<br>
As long as those who want to lead get a chance to, and as long as there is still room for the leader to bring along a few friends and guildmates even if they are of &quot;undesirable&quot; classes, then I am in favor of this change.<br>
