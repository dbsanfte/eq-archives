Kinda kewl we got a forum for us half breeds, but it seems there are some down spirits about our class!<br>
First of all, ya, we got that xp penalty slapped on our ass and we are stuck with it. But ya know why? It's cause we kick so much ass over the other classes! I mean, cmon. Paladins: What better tank? We DONT need a healer, we are very self sufficient, two of us can make up for one cleric (ya get two half assed healers -which makes one ass, and that's good- and two tanks!). We have great weapons! We have rooting/stun/healing! Did I mention a tank with kick ass healing? hehe Paladins, they are great, any other tank has to either sit on his ass for days (warriors), go into combat AGAIN and lifetap his way to a healthy new life (SK's), or grow a beard casting those teeny ranger-heals (guess). Paladins are great.. but....(I'll get to our downsides in a sec)<br>
Rangers!! ta daaa! Thought I was going to bash on them, didn't ya? hehe.. well, maybe later. There is always time for Ranger-Bashing. BUT, they ARE good, IF played right ;P<br>
Rangers make GREAT backup tanks. Just so long as they don't over taunt and stress out the cleric, they work perfectly. I always tell my wife to remove her fbss so I don't have to taunt from a Flux-Bladed-Yak weilding hasted superwoman all the time. She doesn't do as much damage, but in the end we all live longer. But rangers can kite! sorta.. I love grouping with rangers, they are little sow batteries. BESIDES, Rangers aka TauntMachines are so good at taunting the mobs off clerics/enchanters that I love having my wife around so I get to keep fighting and she gets to do the pingpong of racing back and forth running after a Frog who's chasing down our Enchanter. hehe<br>
ShadowKnights... dun dun duuuuuuuuuun...<br>
My FAVORITE Hybrid. If I could restart Fenye, she'd be a SK all the way. SK's have the snaring ability of a ranger, the dot's and lifetaps of young necromancers, a PET, Harm Touch (great for KSing those named mobs that greedy droods try to take from you), as well as Invis to Undead AND Invis!! They rock! They make the best over all hybrid, and while not as good as a Paladin tank wise, they still have the same hp/ac thereabouts as a Paladin and snaring abilities. I usually try to replace the rangers in the group with SK's if we plan on doing some heavy fighting. Plus thier armor is soooo sexy ;P<br>
<br>
Ok!! Bash time!!<br>
<br>
Paladins have a hard time taunting mobs and keeping them on them selves. Too many times I am resorting to using Flash of Light, Stun, and Expulse if I can just to keep em on me. My wife goes beserk sometimes, and I peek over at her, and she's already frothing at the mouth, this hurricane of blades and feet, lightning shooting out of every finger... eesh, guess I'm sleeping on the couch tonight. We just can't taunt well enough to keep up with the damage the other classes do. Granted, we get great weapons for around our 30's, but in our late 40's we have a very hard time keeping up with the other classes like those Warriors with Mithril Staffs, those Rangers with Flux Bladed Axes, etc. After we get our super weapons, like the Fiery Avenger or Holycon Broadsword, we will once again riegn in the damage arena. But until then we will be seen as lazy slacker tanks. hehe.<br>
Rangers!! I ALWAYS  have stuff to say to Rangers!!! ooh, but it'd be like 40 pages long if I did that, so here is the small and short of it.<br>
Rangers do TOO much damage for what they can handle. They are weak in AC, Low in HP, and crud for WIS. Too often I see a party of 5 go down with me into places like Guk or Efreeti raids and everyone is at full life... except Mr. Ranger who is screaming for Complete Heals. Sigh...  Like I'm tellin ya, those fbss's and uber weapons need to be banked if you plan on grouping. They are great for soloing, but very hard on those clerics/healers who are constantly healing your butt. Oh yeah, and Ranger-Heals, hehe, gotta love em.  <br>
Ranger begins to cast a spell.<br>
You are healed for 3 hit points!<br>
Ranger says, 'oom'  *not true, but funny* ;P<br>
SHADOWKNIGHTS dun dun duuuuuuuuuun<br>
hmm.. what is bad about shadowknights...<br>
Other than the fact that they don't do anything the best, and thier pets suck ass for the first 30 or so levels, hehe.<br>
<br>
See ya'll!! I'll be expecting you to flame me on my post! bwahaha<br>

(The bards are a slightly different story, we'll come back to that.) This idea is power through despecialization. Myself, I'm really quite a mediocre tank. When you get right down to it, the Warrior beats me in AC, HP, and damage output, thanks to little things like Dual wielding and Critical attacks, and even kicks when they're using the same 2 hander I am. And we won't even go down the road of me trying to play as a necro. Yay, I can't even solo something 15 levels beneath me using pure caster strategies. Ergo, I suck, right? I can't damage like a warrior, and I can't uber solo like a necro. _Wrong!_ Because of the potent way I can _combine_ magic and melee, I make the truly top flight character class that you want to put into your group over that warrior, or that monk, or even that necro or mage. I'm the guy with some of the true uber taunts. Life tap. Siphon Strengh. Darkness line. Blood boil line. And only once have I HTed a monster that lived that didn't immediately want to hang my guts off the moon and stars. All this, and my pet and taps make me very close to self suffecient too. Enough so that all it takes in my party to take anything not specifically deigned to take 18+ people to take is a Paladin. <br>
<br>
However, I think I made that point before. More important is figuring out how _your_ magic can butress your melee, especially in a group. I know you're a valuable puller, almost as much so as myself, simply because you're the one with the skill to track down that ugly named mob, and you're the one with the bow to peg him from 200 range units off, and bring him steaming down on the rest of us. You've got DD, I know you have snare.. Do you have root? Even if you don't, it's not too hard to develop a sense of how much more whacking you're gonna have to do before the mob taunts on you. Pay attention to everything scrolling past in red and blue, and you'll figure it out fast enough. Why not step back just before, and try to snare/root? Once you succeed, pepper it with DD or arrows(Note I said pepper, not burn your whole mana bar), till you think that short dorfie pally, or that hall clogging ogrish SK has his attention good and solid? Or step back every so many thwacks, let the warrior taunt for a salvo or three, toss a <br>
heal on him, and dive back in?<br>
<br>
No, maybe this isn't as satisfying as being able to outdamage a warrior in melee, but it always seemed clear to me that the hybrid payed that price for much more flexibility. You are not a warrior, you are not a monk, you are not a druid. I am not a warrior, I am not a necro.  Don't expect what works for them to work the same for you. By combining lesser parts of each, you can come up with something that's more than the whole of either. That's the whole point. No, Verant hasn't manage to fine hair balance all the classes, but a rough balance does exist, and there's a hair thin like you have to walk to make sure that you use your potential to the fullest. Break out of the mold everyone else is in. Think when you play. Be a ranger, and not a warrior, and not a Dr00id. Somewhere, there's a combination of the two that will let you bring every last bit of advantage that 40% exp penalty brings you. And, if nothing else, think of the sheer havok a highly skilled group of 1 of each of the hybrids could wreak.<br>
<br>
Everything I've said here is, of course, tempered by the fact that I've not played a ranger at all, nor do I intend to until I've got a full set of Sky-planar Shadow Knight Armor. However, the basic point remains the same. Rangers are not supposed to bring the heavy melee damage of a warrior or monk to the group, nor are they supposed to bring the heavy, two handed blades of the Paladin or SK. You bring something much, much different, and it's up to you rangers to figure out just what it is. Personally, fron what I've seen, you're a blend of Rogue and Druid, more than anything else. You might not have sneak and evade, but there's _something_ in that druid part that makes up for it and more. Might not be what you think it is, but it's there, or they wouldn't have bothered making the class. <br>

There are several basic things that bother me.  One of which is Fenye telling me I am not a tank.  BS  Another is the class balance issue.  My roleplayin experience pre eq was any paper game I could play.  Hours and hours of d&amp;d, vampire, gurps, conspiracy, star wars, rifts, ect....   Classes aren't balanced in other games, and don't have to be to make classes viable.  Rangers, Paladins, and Shadowknights all pay an XP penalty for what?  If we are balanced then we should not have this.  Warriors have many advantages in the game, as we do.  Yet they also require less xp.  With the XP penalty class equality shoulda been considered by using equal amounts of xp, not equal levels.  My 50 ranger has enough experience to make a warrior, what, 55?  <br>
Besides that, my offensive ability does not make up for my lack of defense as a ranger.  This becomes painfully obvious in Kunark.  Since I have the least hp, least ac, and least defensive ability of all tanks and hybrids, why does my spell set not reflect this?  I have been stuck inbetween casting/tanking and it does not fit what I think of when I picture a ranger.  Of course, my view means little.  But I have played my ranger in every zone, and know how to play him well.  It is not a question of tactics, but the inevitable.  I cannot tank 50+, and offer nothing to a group that a different class cannot do better.  I am a mana sink for the healer, can't tank as well as the other tanks, and can't do damage to take the place of a blaster.  (no i do not outdamage everyone besides monks and rogues)  I am lucky enough to have great friends, and together we are always successfull.  The only reason I have not switched out of my ranger completely is the fact that I would have to leave my friends behind.<br>
I am not asking to be able to outdamage a warrior, or a monk, or anything.  I just want to stop being shortchanged with an xp penalty, defensive skill caps, and hp cap.  3 big things against me, and getting sow at 39 didn't make up for it.  Niether did careless lightning (99dd), or my pathetic heals.  Post 50, I hope it is not as grim as it looks.<br>

They are Damage Dealers. The ranger idea of a tank pretty much fizzles out once you grow up and move out of lower guk. From there on, you are going to get smacked hardcore in places like Karnors. Just for example, with my paladin (level 51) I can solo any mob outside Karnor's, without using Lay Hands. I've seen SK's do it even better than me, as I have to root the mob, pull back and heal, then finish it off. My friend, a Ranger (level 54) dies and leaves the mob at a little less than half life. He's gotten alot smarter, and has gotten rid of his weapons that proc, in favor of heavier hitting weapons. This not only keeps him alive in groups, but it makes it much easier for me to keep the taunt off him. <br>
<br>
Anyway, keep thinking yer a tank, Elbyron, and yer never gonna make it in Kunark.  <p>Fenye BlazingVox

My point exactly, we are obviously balanced classess.  I mean if your outside, and you can do something better than a ranger who is 3 levels higher than you, then either that ranger is very dumb, or you are overpowered.  (must be overpowered since rangers aren't underpowered)<br>

And how much more damamge than you do I do anyway?  I think you seriously over estimate it.

Rangers are fine in groups bring your procing speedy damage dealing weapons i dotn care i will keep the mob off of ya.  If your in a group with a palli (and not hitting your taunt button) and you get hit more then 3 or 4 times total the whole fight then the palli is doing something wrong.  A warrior might not be able to taunt off of ya but ya never know perhaps as i have played neither warriors Sk's or monks to high level i can  not judge their taunting potential.  As i have said before the only thing a ranger shouldnt do in battle when grouped is use taunt button i cant overcome your damage your procs and your speed and you taunt long as you dont hit the taunt button i gaurantee you stay near the bottom of the hate list.  The only time a ranger should be taunting is when the chanter or healer are getting wacked, or when they are hte only tank in group.  If you notice i am not asking you to change anything else but that to be group viable bring your speed your procs your damage dotn matter just leave yout taunt at home...<br>

Soon as your ranger procs cast stun.  Mob comes unstunned pissed off at the stunner not the procer goes the same for snareres rooters or nukers let do their thing then stun.  Trust me it works ask any ranger i have grouped with when i am oom then take some damage when i am fm they dont get touched.<br>

In lower guk, in the lords room I was in a group.  2 necros of 49, a 47 warrior, and a 50 paladin, and a 51 cleric, and me 50 ranger. I was pulling with snare.  I did nothing except snare, and the mob would waltz into the room and pound on me, with attack off mind you, throughout the majority of the fight.  Maybe the taunts of the two other tanks were broken, but I was still a mana sink for poor Alairk.  My companions laughed about how much the frogs loved to beat on me.  (don't give me any crap about guk plz, I know I need to &quot;grow up&quot; but its nice and close to the fear portal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

But if the ranger is fm he/she should be kiting that thing around, smack on a DoT or two, pump in a few arrows, sit and med to regain a bit of mana while the creature is catching up to you.

<br>
Rangers have stinging swarm, and immolate for dots.  Try kiting a rager with those.  Your looking at running out of mana before you've taken the critter down 1/4 of its life.  Dots LOL  I kite as well as a 19th level druid.  <br>
<br>
Its definetly possible to kite as a ranger, if you have all day.  (I won't even say how long it took me to kill terrorantula in sro via kiting/melee.  And the method of kitin I had to use would not work in kunark cause of the distance/agro loss, not to mention all the unfriendlies nearby)   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ufenye.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/11/00 1:01:56 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.teleport.com/~ggarren/fenyedarkknight.jpg width=149 height=335></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins, Rangers and SK's, OH MY!!</span><hr size=1> hehe. Elbyron, good thing I wear a neckguard :P<br>
One thing is for sure though, Rangers CANT kite, they don't have the strength in thier dots to kite even remotely efficiently. Those dots are just to add a little extra damage during melee (like the SK does). And don't whine about spells, we are all different. Paladins have no DD's, or dots, but killer heals and buffs. Rangers have crappy heals, but nice DD's and dots. SK's have NO heals, but very cool lifetaps/pets/dots.<br>
<br>
hehe now, to solve the problem at hand...<br>
Verant could turn all the rangers into Shadowknights. That would fix it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>

My bro is a 49 ranger, he can take a rager, costs him a bit in arrows, but the fact stands, HE CAN KILL ONE. Arrows are part of the game, jeez you get sow, snare, what the heck else do you need? (Aren't you all supposed to be the kings of archery? I never see rangers using bows except to pull) Defense, if you are worried about defense, don't get hit. Maybe Verant made it so you guys have to play smart, not in your face fighting. Use some finesse, strategy, and a little bit of tactics. BTW snare dot is a really silly strategy, root dot is much better, ask a druid. <br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but rangers are one of the best kiters out there, well, necros, wizards, then maybe druids/rangers. Arrows don't have cast times, just turn shoot, turn run.<br>
May be long and boring, but who likes soloing anyway, just fun to do while waiting on a group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uarathena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arathena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(7/11/00 11:58:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Paladins, Rangers and SK's, OH MY!!</span><hr size=1> Don't forget, we crazy SK's can kite at just about the same level as a Necro. I'm way down there at the moment, but I've got my Engulfing Darkness(Snare/Dot), my Disease Cloud (Really sucky 1st level necro dot. Hey, it's 1 more damage a tick.), and my Convoke Shadows ( It's a commandable Dot, not a pet. I don't get a pet for a loooong time. ) And, we've got that cute little trick called Fear. But anyway, that's enough rubbing in our inherent superiority over all the weaker races and classes of Norrath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
First, I'd like to simply agree with Kalatar. Yeah, his method here is a bit messy looking, but it should work. It's also exactly what no other class would dare even consider. Root (or snare) , Dot, DD, arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, DD, arrow, arrow, arrow, repeat. *shudder* I'd not even dare. And this gets even more viable with SOW, or god forbid, another ranger partner. Sure, you'll eat up arrows like mad, but.. it does come back to what I said before. Don't try to play like a monk or a druid, cause both will get you killed. Think like Robin Hood(Please don't kill me.). Bow and sword are both exensions of you, not just one or the other.   <br>
Lastly, I'm not sure how much I agree with the idea of Root dot being better than snare dot. Root has a disturbing tendency to break at the wrong time, or so I've encountered... (Course, that particular unnamed wizzy deserved it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) Of course, if you've got the other experience with it, Root away. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>--<br>
