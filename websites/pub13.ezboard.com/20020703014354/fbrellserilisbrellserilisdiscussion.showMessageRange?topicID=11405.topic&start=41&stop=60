Where that point is, though, is beyond me.<br>
<br>
EQ was my very first experience with online gaming.  Well, that's a lie...I had played Diablo online for about 5 minutes once until I was immediately killed and pelted with my own ear.  <br>
<br>
I remember my first EQ character - a Human Paladin named Blackthorne.  I launched him in the city of Qeynos, and was so overwhelmed with everything, and so hopelessly lost, that I simply wandered around South Qeynos for almost a week, trying to figure out what I was supposed to do.  I can't tell you how many times I was killed by that rat that spawns there.  I was so painfully shy, and so horribly bewildered by everything that, every time someone would attempt to talk to me, I would run away.  Eventually, I became frustrated, and created Minadil.<br>
<br>
Those first levels were full of discovery, and I was constantly in awe of my surroundings.  I literally had no friends - had no contact with anyone else in game - until the day that I accidentally wandered into Blackburrow and promptly died.<br>
<br>
I was panicking - I thought that I would never get back the rusty mace and assorted tattered cloth items that I had worked so hard to get.  Plus, at that point I hadn't discovered the bank, and was carrying my entire fortune on my person.  <br>
<br>
I was sitting by the entrance, wondering what I was going to do, when someone sent me a tell, asking me if I needed help.  Apparently, this person had witnessed my gruesome demise at the hands of the gnolls.  And, wonder of wonders, I replied.  Not only did he teach me the basics of grouping, he recovered my corpse, and, hearing my story of being lost in Qeynos, took me on a guided tour.   He seemed to know a lot about the game, and in my mind was all-wise.  He taught me how to put him on my friend list,  but I never saw him online again.  I think that I had him on my friend list until roughly level 35, and now I've forgotten his name completely.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the day that my regular group of friends, Skarsa (who taught me EVERYTHING about being a druid), Fendilin and Evon finally got to move up from the safe room in Blackburrow to the Elite Ledge.  I won't forget the first time I saw Harlequinn the Bard in BB, who was the first player over 20 that I had ever laid eyes on.  Learning to kite in NK, where I leveled to 19.  The other day, a friend of mine that I had met there the day I hit 19 emailed me the log from our conversations immediately before and after I dinged.<br>
<br>
I remember the day I met Tigana in LoIO...we talked for a couple of hours about our favorite books.  I still remember the day that she got black-dyed platemail!  She made me run all the way from the mill to the Front Door to the pillars to see it!<br>
<br>
I guess the thing that I miss most is the discovery.  I miss the camraderie that I shared with those guys.  I miss running from Hill Giants, and taking the long way through WK, off of the path, so I didn't get smooshed by the bandits.  I miss getting lost in zones, and taking the boat, and having all the time in the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uerzebet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Erzebet</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.poisonarrow.com/images/pa_tiny.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lil Beauty</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/19/02 3:31:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11405.topic&index=49>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Weeeee.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I miss getting lost in zones, and taking the boat, and having all the time in the world. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Another thing was everthing was so scary.  I remember at lvl 6 when I had dared cross the zone into WC to explore!  In the distance i saw a giant spider and almost wet my pants!  Even though it was indifferant I still kept about 100 yards from it. Hehe.  Then I saw a PC run from over the hilltop and I almost zoned back into EC. ahhh /nostalgic<br>

Also, my first character was named Sephrino, a half elf Paladin on Mith Marr server.  I still have him for memories.  I remember putting INT points into him because it was too low and I wanted my Paladin to have some brains, heheh.<br>

After about a year of listening to them talk I decided, why not.  I bought the game, installed it and became a &quot;n00b&quot;.  I liked it because as everyone else has said, it was new.  Exp didn't matter much to me, it was the exploring new places that was amazing to me.  But now a year later my first, and still main char, is stuck at 54.  The exp is horrible.  I don't even feel like I get anything done when I log onto him.  I miss those carefree days (like hitting the pod with a spell and seeing just how far I could run before he caught me, or running by someone and doing /bite)<br>
<br>
ah, those were the days... I think I'll go back and revisit black burrow... <p>Baluan Tinkerdee<br>

I loved cranking out 2-3 good hours and getting loot and levels every night. Now it takes 2-3 hours just to get a raid going. <br>
<br>
Most of all I miss the US vs. Server feeling. Back then most people would want to band together to conquer the unknown mobs/dungeons. It didn't matter what guild you were in. Discovery was a blast. <br>
<br>
Now it's US vs THEM mostly with many guilds/cliques fighting over mobs and camps. You have to know the right people to taste the high end game mostly. <br>

My main Chingon was created Aug 24, 1999 and I started playing the game a bit before that so in all respects I totally was a newb and being so I think helps me value many of the experiences I've yet to discover in this game.  Not just acquiring that next item that will make me uber, but the points leading up to that moment.<br>

<br>
I miss that feeling of being scared to go 2 feet from your bind spot. And everything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so much bigger back then.<br>
<br>
I don't think there were many people above 35th when I started so that was pretty cool seeing someone at about lvl 30 in full armour or a FBR!<br>
<br>
A couple of memorable occasions were once when I zoned into Crushbone escaping the mobs at the entrance I was fighting, to be greeted by a wolf who gave me a jade eletrum bracer and said &quot;enjoy&quot;. It was the first ever valuable thing I had and, being me, I kept wearing it for a long time! I was so amazed and everything was still so new to me that I didn't catch the name of the wolf.<br>
<br>
Another was coming out of Felwithe to find this beautiful High Elf lady casting an amazing spell. She was dressed in black which looked so cool and she cast Rune III on me. Her name was Maya and I bowed to her and just thought &quot;I wonder if I'll ever get to be like her!&quot;. I couldn't wait to get to the lvl to cast it myself, having just got my first Rune spell.<br>
<br>
I made a few alts about a year ago, and have only just twinked a couple recently. It's still not the same though. <p><table width="340" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
