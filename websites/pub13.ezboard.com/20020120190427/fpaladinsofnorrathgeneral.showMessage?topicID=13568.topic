It seems on Sol Ro now that the golems can HT from anywhere in the zone and mobs now see invis at zone in. Also about 40 mobs come running to you when you zone in too.<br><br>Last night my guild was going to try fear and we met this. When we zoned in we met 30-40 mobs which began slaughtering us. We were all invis and there is no see invis mobs at the zone but yet mobs saw threw us and killed us all. After about 4 hours of trying to send in a group or 2 we ask another guild to come in and help. The other group brought 4 groups of 55-60 players to help with CR. As soon as they got ready to go in they were dead within 10 minutes from the number of mobs and the HTing golems from across the zone. <br><br>When that guild failed we petitioned the problem to a GM. After about waiting for 3 hours for a responce they GMs finally plane of fear is normal all mobs working as intended. Do mobs in PoF normally see thru invis at zone in? Do 40 mobs come to slaughter as you zone in? And how do golems HT you threw the zone? With 75 bodies rotting and all lost atleast 1 body exp(one of our clerics lost 10 bodies) the GMs refused to help. The players from the guild that helped us(Destiny) almost all had 2+ years of experience in this game. They have done VP and many other big mobs. And when the GMs saw them trying to break the plane and watched them failed the thought it was normal for guilds that can do VP to get whipped out in fear. <br><br>After the GMs said screw you we waited for about another 2 hours and asked another guild for assistance. When they broke in they had problems too. Many more mobs that should of not been there if plane of fear was normal. But they managed to clear so we could start rezzing people but then Draco felt he had to walk and kill them all. After draco left we sent in another team which held and we were finally able to allow every one to zone in and loot.<br><br>Soo can plane of fear whipe out VP capable guilds?(the server`s secand largest guild had this same problem and they do Ntov)Is it normal for 24 55-60 people with 2 years of experience to get whipped out? But there is one thing that was normal that night.... The GMs screwing 75 players when the zone was bugged and they saw how the zone was reacting. To me and about 75+ players GMs will be forever useless now no need to petition to them because even when you have a major bug going on effecting many people you get sorry working as intended. <p><p><font face="verdana, arial" size="-2"><u><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14267" target=top>Gladoitor Ironheart</a></u> [<a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/bsyndicates93705" target=top><i>DarkBlood</i></a>]<br>      <b>53 Cavalier</b><br>      Solusek Ro</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uceebelancot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CeebeLancot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/22/01 6:09:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13568.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear...</span><hr size=1> As I understand it, PoF is bugged right now on Xegony.

It was the most difficult Fear break I have ever encountered and it actually took us four attempts. We were able to evac alright the first time when we came against close to 20 mobs that came out of nowhere. Everybody was following directions and I can't imagine how we aggroed so many. The second attempt was a disaster that left us calling upon some assistance because nobody knew what the hell was up with Fear. The third attempt (one break group), again evac as the chanter died... the fourth attempt (two break groups) we were finally able to hold camp after plowing through what seemed to be half the mobs in the zone. (I never want to see another scareling again!)<br><br>I'd say the aggro is whacked right now... there is no way a Fear break should entail as much killing as we had to. I really felt bad for everybody that was eagerly awaiting a rez, they missed one hell of a fight and a few drops too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukeynsoulfighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keyn Soulfighter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/23/01 6:41:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13568.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://jbob147.homestead.com/files/keynmug1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear...</span><hr size=1> same thing happened to our fear raid..<br><br>i suggested they may have messed something up with the luclin expansion, as the fear raid was just 2 days after it <p><p ALIGN=center><IMG SRC="http://jbob147.homestead.com/files/luclinsig.jpg"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulydirnw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LydirnW</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/23/01 7:09:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13568.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Fear...</span><hr size=1> Cleared PoF 3 times in the past couple of days to drop Cazic- Haven't had any such problems on Ayonae Ro.

Last few times we went in, we would just AE everything in site, no bigge.<br><br>Well this time, those guys zoned in and got a suprise, stuff was aggroing from far accross the zone, it was truly insane.  Wiped them all out.  An other guild was finally able to successfully break in after us an hour or so after our last attempt.  The aggro wasnt near as bad, i think somehow the pathing got seriously screwed up.<br><br>Definatly something fishy in fear last night.<br><br><br>**I should add my guilds been doing fear since it opened two years ago its not like we are fear nubs or something. <p>Phantomsix Solarblade<BR>Destiny<BR>Solusek Ro</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uphantomsix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phantomsix</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.eqdestiny.com/images/p6/p6icon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 12/24/01 1:17:16 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13574.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13576.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13568.topic&index=12><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=13568.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=13568.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13568.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13568.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Swords and Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm8">Epic Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm9">Paladin Polls<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge(read only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might(Roleplay Tavern)<option value="paladinsofnorrathdiscoverkunarkitemszones">Discover Kunark!
