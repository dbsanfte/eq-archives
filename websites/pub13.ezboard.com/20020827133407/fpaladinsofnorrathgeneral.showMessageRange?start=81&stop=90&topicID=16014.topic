<br>
Valor of Marr is attractive for this sort of test due to the mana cost, but it's not a good for testing due to the fact that it is unique to us. The best test would be a spell that clerics get with a high mana cost and short cast time (to eliminate some of the variance due to mana regenerating).<br>
<br>
I'll try this test while on a conference call to help alleviate the boredom. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

<br>
We should very much have a spell casting penalty to this days as it's removal was n'er announced. Tha penalty was described as being applied on each cast, in addition to tha mana listed on tha spell scroll. Tha penalty also was a sliding scale starting at 25% and decreasing to almost nothing at level 60 (post-Kunark). Nothing more has e'er been said about it by Verant.<br>

It be ano'er stupid calculation that wastes server cpu cycles by tha millions. It would have been more efficient ter keep tha (level-9) initial penalty then to keep a per cast penalty.<br>

I've tested it several times and seen no penalty. I suggest others do the same and see what they get. BTW, magelo is slightly off on mana calculation for some people for some reason, so if you want your actual mana total, multiply your wis (200 and less wis) by your level and then by 0.2, and then add your direct mana. I suggest testing with less than 200 mana, as mana after 200 scales down the closer you get to 255 (you get more mana for the 201 point than you do for the 255 point for example).<br>

I usually feel the need to respond to those that responded to me, but I am not going to do that this time. It was wrong of me to come here and do what I did. If I offended anyone, I am sorry for that too. I just thought someone would like to see things from a different point of view but obviously I was wrong there too.<br>
<br>
When I started, I played with my sisters. One started a warrior (they had been playing before, but started over when I started playing), one started a cleric, and they wanted me to start a druid to round out he group. I have pretty much played this game grouped since level five. I would go out and solo from time to time, but quad kiting had insane down time, and root dotting was extremely boring. Charming was fun, but extremely dangerous and not really that great for experience. In the end though, the best experience was always in groups. <br>
<br>
When we got into our fifties, we used to do howling stones because no one ever went there. The exp was far greater than I ever got soloing. And it continues to this day. Going to easy spots where little healing is needed just isn't very fun. It is almost as boring as soloing and not any better on the experience. But, going to the tough spots and killing the tough mobs was what always brought in the experience. Now days, it is just so depressing to hunt anywhere that doesn't have the type of experience that CT or somewhere similar offers. Killing mobs that couldn't beat you in five minutes if you were afk just isn't fun. It is no wonder so many look at it like work or that it is refered to as 'the grind.' I play the game to be chalanged and to have fun and any place a druid can be the main healer is neither chalanging or fun. Fun is trying to break the four corners room in CT with one group, and even the following CR was more fun that your average CR (really must time those repops).<br>
<br>
Before I came here, I had been reading the druid board where clerics were pouring in to tell druids that they don't need better heals or should only get small improvements. The reasons are always the same. Your class has so many skills (most of which are spells that go unused), or your class has ports (which will be pretty much meaningless in PoP), or your class can solo (which I practically never do). I feel like I am being punished for playing the game the way it was intended to be played, in a group. I know there are a few other classes that also have high end raiding problems, but I don't play those classes. Warriors could use a few tweaks, but nothing so bad that they are useless yet in the raiding game. But the druid class hasn't really grown in any way since RoK came out. The way the class stands now, I would rather them take away all direct heals from druids and just give them different types of regens so I would quit being called on to do a job on raids that many times I have no hopes of being able to do.<br>
<br>
So, that is where I am coming from. If my remarks earlier offended anyone, I am sorry. I am also sorry for getting this thread off course. And back on topic I must say that I think the removal of the healing penalty is a positive step in the right direction. <p><font size="+1"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1"><b><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=153420>Talyena Trueheart</a>, Hierophant of Tunare<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203026>Tresha Trueheart</a>, Warlord for Erollisi Marr<br>Dawntreaders, Terris-Thule</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wulfherehausakliufr>Wulfhere Hausakliufr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 981<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/17/02 2:00:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16014.topic&index=86>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> thank ya Talyena</span><hr size=1> Ah dunnae hold yer words against ya and ya speak well ter yer points.

A druid can top a nuke for 1000 and heal for 1000. They have most every tactical spell and irresistable dots and fire debuffs to empower their nukes. Druids be made as hit and run killers on tha Zeks and so we have a very lot o them.<br>

There wasn't a reason to remove it.  Its really not a big deal either.  If it starts out at 10 percent until level 51 and then drops a percent each level, you're not going to notice that 1 percent of lost mana at 60.  If you've got 1500 mana, at 60 you're losing 15 pts if you dump all of it.  Think about how long it takes to get that much back.  Now think about how much mana you need to have before you'll really notice it casting spells and gaining a few points back every tick.<br>
<br>
I don't think our mana penalty is very large.  It used to be much worse.  They reduced it back when they did the hybrid rebalancing, but they didn't remove it completely.<br>

<br>
I removed all of my equipment and did not have clarity. This leaves me with a wisdom of 85 and I'm 56h level. According to the caster's realm calculator, I should have 1064 mana. According to the equation posted by Ab (level * wisdom * 0.2), I should have 952 base mana.<br>
<br>
I was able to cast 7 greater heals, 1 Heal and 1 Light Heal, so:<br>
<br>
(7*150) + 60 + +25 = 1135<br>
<br>
I was unable to cast a Minor Heal, so I had less than 10 mana by the end of the casts. I had no fizzles.<br>
<br>
I performed the test again with my wisdom at 97 (don't laugh, that's what my equipment gives me). The results were:<br>
<br>
8 Greater heals, 1 Heal, 1 Minor Heal or<br>
<br>
(8*150) + 60 + 10 = 1270<br>
<br>
The mana calculator claims that I should have 1198. The formula posted by Abs predicts 1086.<br>
<br>
This result is quite surprising to me, and I don't see that there is a flaw unless there's something special about healing spells (e.g., we get a discount for casting them).<br>
<br>
These data certainly indicate that we don't have a casting penalty, unless the equations are out of date or there's something specific to healing spells. We actually have MORE mana than is predicted by either of those two equations.<br>
<br>
EDIT: In my second test, I forgot that I have two items (crystal spider eyes; white bear pelt cloak) that add a total of 85 mana directly, so my predicted mana from EQ casters would be 1283, which is awfully close. The first test, however, is still a fair bit off. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>
