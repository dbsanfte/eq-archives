Only to find out a few minutes later that another person posted at the same time.  So, Adune ends up rolling the date between those that posted at 12:00:00.<br>
<br>
Is it time that we find a better solution to this?  This is what I would consider board camping at it's finest.  Honestly, this problem is only going to get worse, in my opinion.<br>

And considering that weekend raids are the only raids quite a few of the &quot;new&quot; 50's can attend, it just makes for an ugly board camping situation.<br>
<br>
I do think that stretching the reservation system to three weeks would be a good start.<br>
<br>
However, considering how it seems rather apparent that Verant is going to upgrade Fear / Hate somewhat this patch or next, I'm interested in seeing what complications arise from it.<br>

<br>
I'd like to see a rules stating:<br>
<br>
An Indy/Guild may only sign up once per date.  If there are multiple posts for the same date, they will be deleted.<br>
<br>
When signing up for a date, the subject must contain the date &amp; start time.<br>
<br>
It's annoying to deal with 3 posts because someone was timing their clock to board time exactly.  If you want to board camp, fine.  But if you post early, that's it.  Maybe we'll see less camping of 12:00:00 if people know than an early post will mean they can't signup for the date.  It would also make it impossible for multiple guild members to camp the same date to increase chances.<br>
<br>
Re: Start time, it's helpful for the people signing up, and for mods.  We know right away if a time zone conflict will exist or not.  The way it is now, people can sign up for dates, get posted to calendar, and then post start times that conflict with each other.  Unless I check the posts of people that didn't include a start time daily, it's quite possible that time zone conflicts could slip through, and screw up a raid.  <br>
<br>
But whatever, it doesn't matter.  Too many people would oppose those changes. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udexn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dexn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/5/01 2:39:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Board Camping, we have been expert at it!!</span><hr size=1> I would defintely like to see how things change when Fear and Hate get increased. If there are a substantial number of mobs.. or they also get harder, some of the traditional &quot;in and out in 5 hours&quot; crews may not be able to do it.<br>
<br>
If that happens, you could have an increase demand on the weekends.  <br>
<br>
I really hope that's not the case.. I am kinda partial to getting in and out of hate or fear in 5 hours or less.<br>
<br>
I would be interested in seeing what other methods could be suggested to avoid board camping.<br>

From what I've been hearing (all heresay at this point) the upper areas are what are being buffed a lot more so raiding the lower section could still mean a 5 hour to folks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1928<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/5/01 3:04:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Board Camping, we have been expert at it!!</span><hr size=1> The 3 week thing may be a good start in helping.  Someone did some statistics on indys and guilds and how often they raided the planes.  Only good argument I can see for not extending it to 3 weeks is that you may end up getting people to plan so far ahead, they either forget or the people signing up may not even be valid anymore.  May be worth a try and then see how it goes to make sure the raids are happening.   Maybe since fear is in such a demand, if a guild hosts hate, they shouldn't be able to host fear in the 2 week alottment?  Hate doesn't seem to have as much of a demand so doing it the other way may leave hate open more than it should be.  /shrug<br>
<br>
I do think there should be a rule on what goes in the first post.  Granted we don't always know the start time at first, but I've seen too many posts without atleast a guild tag or indy statement so who knows who is posting for whom.  <br>
<br>
As for having a rule of multiple posts, this doesn't appear to be an epidemic (how often does this happen really?) from what I've seen.  I don't think it is right that if someone posts first and it doesn't hit the time right, they shouldn't be allowed to post again.  Sometimes they could have the date wrong on what they are posting for and hit it a day early..they shouldn't be penalized.  <br>

I do like that idea.  I think it would help reduce the number of reservations, giving others a better shot.<br>
<br>
I have agreed with the 3 week thing for a long time.  We are a crowded server now and stretching that will also allow more people to sign up for Hate/Fear raids.  Each night when I log on, around 9pm CST, there are nearly 2400 people on the server at once.  I remember when servers where split when they had this many people on during prime time.<br>
<br>
I do think it's time that we address this problem though.  I don't think making rules that will disqualify someones raid would help.  We are trying to prevent FFA, not encourage it.  Let's make the changes so they benefit everyone, but also benefit the individual raid leaders as well.<br>

1) This isn't happening as an epidemic mind you<br>
<br>
2) No one is complaining ONCE the random is done and the person is picked<br>
<br>
<br>
IF this starts happening 60% of the time, I may buy another system needing to put it in place.  If people say Screw it to the random and complain about it and THIS becomes epidemic, I may buy another system needing to put it in place.  Until then...I'm kind of tired of people wanting drastic changes when it only affects maybe 20% or less of the dates.<br>

I think you are making mountains out of mole hills on this subject for now..this may change later.<br>

Why cant we do that? If two people sign up at the same time, then just split the raid and bring 2-3 groups from watchers and 2-3 groups from Blood Inferno.<br>
<br>
Only issues I see here, are those guilds who have loot rules that you need a lawyer to define.  Most people stick with the CAWU methodology to loot.  And as long as the two raid leaders communicate before hand the specifics, I don't see why this cant be the solution.<br>
<br>
Hey, gee... that almost brings me back to what I prefer to do anyhow... just communicate your intent in game  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><P><center><table border="5" width="75%" bgcolor="#000000" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<br>
Personally I feel ties should just be thrown out and the next valid &quot;non-tied&quot; time gets the date. It is quite clear that people are using automated scripts to post their raid intentions based on the increase in the amount of posts coming in at exactly 12:00:00. This is rediculous and should not be rewarded.<br>
<br>
So here is how it works.....if 2 people post and both hit 12:00:00, both posts are tossed. If someone waits and hits 12:00:05, then they get the date. So basically if you want to use an automated script you run the risk of getting squat if someone else does the same. But if you try to gamble and offset the time by a small margin you might get lucky and get it. Would save the Mod's a lot of headache and reintroduce and element of chance into the proccess.  <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">

<br>
Scripts are really less reliable than the human touch in this case though IMHO... nothing to guarantee the board accepts the post on the first shot (lag or whatever) and if it's a script there really wouldn't be a second chance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usadara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadara</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 545<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/6/01 7:06:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Board Camping, we have been expert at it!!</span><hr size=1> Can someone repost Twiggie's idea?

The problem with her solution as I see it is that it further increases the involvement of the Mod's as they would need to track every guilds entrance to the Planes to solve disputes.<br>
<br>
  We need a system that is simple and quick and does not increase the expense of the Mod's valuable time.  My idea, while no means perfect, does that is a simple and straightforward manner. <p><font size=2 face="Tempus Sans ITC, Verdana, Helvetica">
