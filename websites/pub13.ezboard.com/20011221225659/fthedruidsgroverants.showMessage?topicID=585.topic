I've been reading the posts on the board for awhile and finally thought I'd go ahead and post.<br>
I don't currently play a Druid but I know exactly how you all feel-my main is a lvl 40 Shaman.<br>
<br>
My boyfriend and I began playing EQ together back in May (2001). He made a little wood elf Warrior and I made a High Elf Pally. I have to say we had the best time grouping together killing wasps, orc and whatnot. We would both hunt wolfs for ruined pelts and he would make patchwork clothes-which I was very proud to wear.<br>
<br>
I have countless memories of my innocent EQ days..now it's gotten to where I absolutely hate this game.  As most of you can relate, my days are spent with stranger's faces starting up at me with the &quot;beg look&quot; on their faces.<br>
A quick inspection of me and then they start begging. I quite enjoy the ones who beg that are around lvl 2 or so with better equiptment than I can ever hope to have..<br>
<br>
Do you know how I have to farm for &quot;Phat&quot; money to get my equiptment? (Keep in mind-I'm lvl 40) Stonebrunt..that's right. Most of the time I'm the only one in the zone and sit there with my wolf pet beating up Kobolds and then running up to the Kejekan town when my bags are full and selling my 2gp-3pp items I loot.<br>
It's pathetic!! For 5 days straight I farmed the Kobolds for 10hours a day just so I could buy a Plat ruby veil and 2 +6 wis rings.  That's what pisses me off..I don't mind working for what I have..I will spend countless hours doing what I have to, to get what I need..WHY DON&quot;T YOU?<br>
<br>
Needless to say when I can log on (Our Cable connection works decently for about 2 weeks out of the month)<br>
I am pestered by begs, SoW requests, PL requests etc..<br>
I don't mind helping people one bit, but after awhile I have soured up.  As soon as I log in Im hailed. Have I ever been hailed and then the person just said &quot;Hi, nice day isn't it?&quot; Heck no. I WANT, I WANT!  You won't give me what I want? Then fine..let me cuss you out. Want me train you as well?<br>
<br>
I hardly play anymore. I'm getting tired of putting people on ignore and more than 1/2 of my slim gaming time is spent helping some random stranger who never says thank you..but rather wonders what more can I do for them.<br>
<br>
What used to be a source of enjoyment for both me and my boyfriend is a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
My question to you is:<br>
Do any of the experiences/attitudes dealing with people in the game make you want to stop playing for good?\<br>
<br>
2nd question:<br>
I feel as if I can't say no to people, mostly due to a guild tag hanging over my head.  Anyone else feel like this?<br>
<br>
Sorry if this rant has become a bit long :(<br>

<br>
I am begged, often.  I ignore it, or tell them exactly how to go about getting it on their own, if they don't get it, I simply port out.  Granted you can't due that, but you could inform then that you wish to be left alone and futher harrasment will be delt with as such.<br>
<br>
As for the PL requests etc, I turn down my guild all the time.  I simply don't PL people.  I worked hard through each of my levels, and you miss out on so much being rushed threw levels, I refuse to do it.<br>

<br>
I started playing EQ in April of 2000.  My boyfriend had been playing the game for about a year already at the time, and I pretty much complained for a year. =P  Eventually he convinced me to play using the "but honey, it's something we can do <i>together</i>" spiel.  (Hey, as I said in another post, I'm a sucker. =P)<br>
<br>
18 months later, I had a high lvl cleric, wizard, druid, and mid lvl bard.  I had had my share of high lvl play, raids, and the excessive bickering over loot, spawns, and epics, not to mention the slew full of beggars, since my 3 highest lvl chars were classes of high demand for favors.  Eventually I just got really sick of seeing friends turn against each other because one had some bad luck getting his/her epic.  While Verant did a great job allowing people to build communities and friendships, they did a poor job helping people maintain them.<br>
<br>
Eventually I had just gotten sick and tired of EQ all together when DAoC was released, and I relinquished my account (as did my boyfriend who felt the same way I did) to a good friend we met in game who still enjoys the game, mainly because his entire family plays it.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't miss it, regret it, nor do I really look back.  I am still friends with a lot of people I met back in EQ, and many of them, who felt the same way I do about EQ, have also quit and moved on to DAoC to join my boyfriend and me.  We still group regularly there and have loads of fun.  Without the annoyances of EQ. :)<br>
<br>
And yes, you can say "no" to people.  If you don't, they'll walk all over you.  I remember once when I was hitting the bank in Kelethin with my cleric, unloading my loot and money of the day, and prepping to log for the night when a 7th lvl rogue sent me a tell requesting me to go rez him at the chessboard in Butcherblock.  I explained to him that I'm getting ready to camp for the night and because he was 7th lvl, he didn't lose much exp, and didn't warrant my abandoning my plans and racing to rez him.  He proceeded to attempt a guilt trip on me saying that 'uber people like me just don't give a damn about newbies because we're too wrapped up in ourselves and in our uberness.'  To me that was utter BS, and I explain to him that being hostile towards me wasn't going to help his situation and convince me to race on over to save his butt.  <br>
<br>
I've many many many similar situations that would take pages for me to tell, but as a cleric, I've heard SO many stories it's not even funny.  But you just have to put your foot down sometimes.  You can't save the world by yourself and if you have something you're doing at the time, just say "no I'm busy atm."  If they persist on annoying you, well sweetie, that's what /ignore is for.  It won't or at least shouldn't ruin your reputation just because you didn't drop everything to go SoW someone.  Everyone has had their share of beggars. <p><CENTER>

I have already left EQ. Well actually I have about 3 months left as i prepay 6 months at a time, but I have not played in about 2 months. I now play DAOC and love it. I have persuaded 3 of my friends from EQ to switch. DAOC has some problems and it is not for everyone. I am not intending to make this an EQ sucks, DAOC rules post, but If you would like a break try it out you get the first 30 days free.<br>
<br>

I would say considering that, DAoC is a vast improvement from EQ.  No, DAoC isn't for everyone, but then again, neither is EQ.  Namely those who wish to keep their marriages intact. =P<br>
<br>
Now I'm not saying that EQ sucks, it has its perks, IE the ease of building friendships, and a sense of community, but way before DAoC was released, it was rumored to be &quot;EQ done right,&quot; and I pretty much believe that.  (I can name several examples, but it'd take too long to explain. =P)<br>
<br>
It's a nice change, and refreshing to not have to deal with &quot;uber d00ds&quot; and beggars...yet. ;)  <p><CENTER>

I guess he thinks he's going to try to win me back into playing with the lure of playing a Vah Shir..doubt it.<br>
<br>
I'll have to try out DAoC, I've heard about a lot of people playing it and really enjoying it. Is it similar to EQ in terms of game style?  (I get bored with games like Diablo/Baldurs gate etc.)<br>

DAoC tends to emphasize PvP (known as RvR, Realm vs Realm) quite a bit.  When you pick one realm to play in, you cannot choose to have characters in another realm on the same server.  Eventually, as you lvl higher, you have the option to fight people in the other 2 realms and defend your relics or take over theirs.<br>
<br>
I've played Diablo II and I don't think DAoC is quite like that.  A couple of good things in DAoC is, when you die, you never lose your corpse/equipment nor do you ever lose your lvl.  So you'll never have to spend 3 hours on a CR.  There are a lot of bonuses in DAoC but those are the 2 that stand out for me.  Tradeskills are also nicely done as well.<br>
<br>
I would recommend you surf around various DAoC sites and read about it if you're interested.  It's basically EQ done right. ;) <p><CENTER>

It makes you work harder, but as a side-effect and reward, most of the d00dz stay away from it :)<br>

Or of course you could try DAoC. <p>-- <BR>
