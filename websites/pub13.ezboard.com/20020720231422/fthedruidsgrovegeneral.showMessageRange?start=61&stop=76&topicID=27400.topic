Not so.  Not so at all.  The high end melee in our guild had pretty much graduated from Primal.  They had better weapons.  They would toss primal in for the buff if they had it on them, but it wasn't a huge deal to them.  For most of them Primal weapons were a soloing toy.

That was my point.  Primal is for the +ATK buff, not necessarily for the ratio of the weapon.  Unless a better buffing weapon comes out, I have little doubt that melees will continue to swap in primal every few minutes for the buff proc.<br>

<br>
If you have a melee who has banked a primal (and doesn't carry another with them) I would assume they are heavy RPers and/or cognitively challenged. Primal weapons are the single biggest increase in melee power of any item or set of items introduced into the game - period.<br>

<br>
Not a big deal?! The proc is the whole point of having a primal weapon. Avatar increases melee damage output by an average of 20%. If a melee was unable to proc avatar then swap out weapons, he would need a weapon that is 15/19 to be an upgrade to his 13/20 primal weapon. How many 15/19 weapons are there out there? HINT: the blade of carnage off of the AoW is 15/20, and Jaelen's katana from Vulak is 14/19.<br>
<br>
A guild with all of its melees equipped with primals is going to have much higher damage output than one with no primals.<br>

<br>
+atk buffs are huge. Why do you think most rogues hold onto their epic even though there are weapons with much better ratios available? Their epic has an innate +40 atk, that's why. Rogues won't bank RB for NTOV piercers, unless you are talking the Vulak piercer.<br>
<br>
EDIT: wanted to add a few quotes from the safehouse thread I pointed to.<br>
<br>
&quot;+20-30% increase in dps /hug avatar&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe Wendolyn said that there is no point in ever taking primal out of the off-hand. The loss in DPS from primal dropping even for a minute makes up for the tiny loss in damage you get from having an inferior ratio.<br>
<br>
I am wondering WHAT ratio would be needed to overcome 13/20 + avatar. I suspect it's somewhere around 19/20 &quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't replace primal with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> No weapon in the game</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is so good that primal can't make it better.&quot; <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14686"> Graal MacBladefury</A><BR>

Ah, but I'm NOT talking about the base dps (my 20dps guess above), I'm talking about the DIFFERENCE, which for a druid is gonna be maybe 1-3 dps, and if you're only meleeing half the time, that's what, half to 1.5 dps?  Hardly worth the lengthy discussion, pertaining to druids.<br>
<br>
1 - I'm not saying don't melee, I'm saying a lot of effort to determine if 8% extra haste is better than 15 extra ATK is a waste of time FOR DRUIDS.<br>
<br>
2 - It's probably worth discussing for melees, but then you have to bring in all the other variables.  Does the +15 ATK bring you above the MOBs AC?  Then +15 ATK will rule.  If your ATK is already well above the MOBs AC, then an extra 8% (or however much it works out to) haste is likely better.  Worth a term-paper effort for melees, not worth the effort for druids.<br>

Edited in: Weapon: Nature Walker's Scimitar (20/30)<br>
<br>
I found a corrupted elysian elder, and since we were going to kill it anyways, I decided to melee it down instead of killing it in the standard way.<br>
<br>
Fight started with pull, I start meleeing, enc/clr start putting in dots, I'm meleeing.  Enchanter slows.  Oops.  Enchanter gets summoned.  Well, I want to make this as clean as possible (ie if people get summoned I might not always get hits in, and it won't be facing me so it won't be a consistant test).  I also realized that if I cast dots that's going to affect my DPS.<br>
<br>
So at this point, I tell enchanter to not slow,  Cleric will just CH me, I will porcupine it down with no casting from me (though I did have one cast to recast ds on myself... only about 5 sec of not fighting though).<br>
<br>
Also at the end, because I was worried about running/gating etc we decided to nuke it down.<br>
<br>
The log covers 417 seconds after the slow and winged death wore off (after the summon) and lasts right up the point where we start nuking it down.<br>
<br>
Here are the numbers:<br>
<br>
You vs. A CORRUPTED ELYSIAN ELDER:<br>
DS: 10120 dmg in 417 sec (24.27 DPS, min: 46, max: 46, avg: 46)<br>
slash: 4730 dmg in 417 sec (10.48 DPS, min: 2, max: 84, avg: 40)<br>
total dmg done: 14850 dmg in 417 sec (35.61 DPS)<br>
<br>
So... with an rbb, VoG, and 1040 attack vs a elder (probable level ~54?) I did 10.48 dps main-tanking.  <br>
<br>
If you're curious during that same time period:<br>
<br>
A CORRUPTED ELYSIAN ELDER vs. You:<br>
hits: 21326 damage in 417 sec (51.15 DPS, min: 44, max: 145,  avg: 97)<br>
<br>
So that's the end of the hard data.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen of logs, if you are attacking from behind and don't get riposted etc (unfortunately I forgot to turn misses on) you'll do 10-20% more damage.  Also if you get avatar you'll get 10-20% more damage.<br>
<br>
If you take 10.5 (essentially) and add 20% you get 12.6; if you then add avatar at 20% to that you get 15.12 DPS.  That's with a 31% haste item though; results with a different haste item will differ of course.<br>
<br>
If you had medded those 417 sec instead, at 255 meditate (assuming the formula mana gained per tick is med/10) you would have gained 1772 mana.  Using wildfire (since not everyone has moonfire yet) at no specialization, you would have been able to cast 5 wildfires  for 1600 mana at a cost of 5 ticks with no med which would cost 128 mana for a total cost of 1728 mana, still well within the mana you would have regained.  Full non-crit hits of wildfire would be 5120 damage.  This will of course depend on the mob's resistance, as well as any crits you might get.  This also doesn't take into account any specialization at all or any SCM which a druid might have.  An Evo druid with SCM3 would get much higher numbers.<br>
<br>
Of course there are times when a druid can't sit down, as many people have pointed out.  I'm not that good at math, so maybe if someone could figure out with what 10.5dps at 89% (31% item, 58% spell) haste vs no haste vs shissar etc. and determine whether it's worth asking for.<br>
<br>
One last thing: this is only one parse against one mob.  It may or may not be extrapolatable to other xp mobs, or to raid mobs.<br>

<br>
nice post!<br>
<br>
Just to add to your mana regen numbers:<br>
<br>
Med formula is med skill/12.  At 252, you med 21/tick.<br>
<br>
You also mention having PotG, MotH, and KEI, which adds 6+3+14 = 23 mana/tick.  Not taking any AA or FT/8th shawl into account.<br>
<br>
417 seconds is roughly 69 ticks, so in 69 ticks you would regain 24 mana/tick standing (add the 1/tick you get when standing) = 1656 mana.  Assuming no AA and non-Evoc spec, Wildfire costs 304 mana per cast, so you can safely cast 5 wildfires, even while meleeing.<br>
<br>
If medding instead, 44 mana/tick * 69 ticks = 3036 mana, so let's call that 10 casts (it's close).  The extra 5 casts of wildfire will roughly equal the melee damage (in this case).<br>
<br>
However, sitting and medding loses the damage shield damage.  Of course, you couldn't do this solo anyway, cause you can't heal 21kHP of damage to yourself while meleeing =).<br>
<br>
So the real question of melee and cast a little vs. med and cast a lot really only applies to group/raids situations.  The presence of Moonfire, Evoc spec, SCM-AA and SCF-AA would tend to favor med and cast more.  Lots of FT, 8th shawl, Bard song and MC-AA all skew the results more towards melee and cast less.<br>
<br>
If the mob just resists everything you cast, or if you can't sit between casts due to agro issues, then by all means melee.  Of course, a horse mitigates the &quot;can't sit between casts&quot; issue also.<br>
<br>
But how much difference does squeezing every last bit of melee power help?  In this example, let's assume we could play around and get 15 dps instead of the 10.5 mentioned.  4.5dps * 417 seconds = 1876 additional damage.  Not too bad.<br>

Also, I don't think the KEI/bardsong etc numbers should matter, unless you get to such a point that you can't find enough stuff to cast without getting agro that you are always at FM.  Certainly that can be the case in some situations.  I've found though with a solid warrior against xp mobs, I can chain cast nukes right from the start and still not get agro (well I do wait a few seconds before starting the first one).<br>
<br>
Before I give back the RBB I might try and find a mob and attack it from behind with a warrior in front... Just gotta find a mob that has enough hp that I can get a long enough test that it's not going to be too skewed, and that isn't totally messed up like a scion.<br>
<br>
Otoh most druids aren't going to be wearing an RBB anyways... too bad I don't have the PoA belt or some other item with haste on it.<br>

<br>
If you are meleeing and become FM, your DPS for the few seconds it takes to cast, will be MUCH higher with a DD vs. melee.  Unless, of course, your nukes won't land.<br>
<br>
That's why I stated in my response that mana-regen enhancements skew towards melee, since you get the mana regen while meleeing, allowing you to cast more often.  Abilities which decrease mana usage and/or give crits would skew you towards medding, to maximize the amount of mana you could pour into nukes.<br>
<br>

<br>
Edit - looked at it some more, and here's the bottom line regarding efficiency.  If you are evoc spec, you need to be doing more than 11.2 dps to make melee better than medding and saving up for wildfire.  But even if meleeing, still cast wildfire when FM.<br>
<br>
Also, if it's a long fight, DoTs are more efficient than DDs, so WD might be your best bet.  Sitting and medding for WD is better than melee, unless you are doing at least 14.5 DPS.<br>
<br>
For comparison, keeping epic and drones up all the time adds up to 15.5 DPS.  WD is 26 DPS when it's up.  In your example, you would med back mana faster than WD uses it, so you could still melee some.  So let's assume epic, drones, WD, and 2 ticks of melee a minute.  590 + 340 + 1560 + 126 = 2616 damage in a minute, which is 43.6 DPS.<br>
<br>
Still pretty pathetic compared to a melee. (Unless I'm remembering wrong.  Melees do 100-150 DPS, right?  If not please correct me)<br>
<br>
Of course, there are non-DPS measures to a druid's worth (heals, regens, debuffs, resists, snare, root, etc).<br>

I wish! There are some rogues who can hit these numbers with consistency, and some monks who can hit the low end of the range, but they are definitely the exception. This is assuming we aren't talking about Luclin mobs. The AC on Luclin mobs is generally higher than on others, and on the ubers is insanely high.<br>
<br>
Try the same thing in sebilis and see what your numbers are. High AC mobs penalise those with lower attack the most. <br>
<br>
40 DPS is about what a paladin with epic will get in a normal xp group, assuming he has spell haste. With a 30/36 2 hander, I probably average a little above 35 DPS at level 59 with a silvery belt of contention (great priest belt). Did the chanter haste you in this scenario? <br>
<br>
VI is finally starting to introduce priest weapons that just might make it worthwhile to melee, beyond the fun factor. <br>

The following are my OPINIONS.<br>
<br>
VoG is a better haste spell than shissar for most people. This includes casters.<br>
<br>
First off, when you consider caster melee, a large percentage of the damage (or a large amount of the usefulness of the melee) comes from procs. More dex = more procs. Shissar doesn't add dex, VoG does.<br>
<br>
VoG lasts longer. Granted, it also costs 275 mana as opposed to 0, but, in the era of mana robes, mod rod2s, necro twitches, FT, KEI, etc...trust me, my mana isn't an issue. Me being irritated at having to constantly buff people is =P.<br>
<br>
BTW, all of Tudamorf's research results coincide with my anecdotal experience (although I haven't performed any specific tests). Especially his stuff about % haste and ATK.<br>
<br>
Funny how, if shissar is so much better, all the tanks in my guild get VoG, except for the occasional puller and person who wants to see whether or not he can break X amount of AC - and none of them complain. I guess, though, that it's possible all their anecdotal support of VoG &gt; Shissar is wrong, just as all those tanks asking for the best haste spell were wrong...hehe.<br>
<br>
<br>
Er, but, more to the point...<br>
<br>
Sure, I'd haste a druid. I'm always hasted and meleeing (unless the mobs resist fire lures, in which case I switch to rightclicking my iceshatter), why shouldn't you be? Betcha I can do more damage than you! *sticks out tongue* =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27400.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27400.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27400.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=27400.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=27400.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27400.topic&index=76><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=27400.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=27400.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27400.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27400.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
