This is just some things that I end up thinking about everytime I come on to play this game! And I know many people think similarly to me, so...)<br>
<br>
Ok, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> doing Epic Quests and getting friends to help</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Up until now I have refused to start my Epic Quest. The main reason is that I cannot play regulary: what time I do have playing the game I prefer to get in exp groups in order just to meet old and new faces, and most of all to spend time with my guild. This is proven by the fact I see many people I used to group with hit lvl 60th and I see loads of new faces about. (In fact some people I helped out as newbies are now 58+)!<br>
<br>
Now, I have spent a lot of my time trying to get to 54th so that my friends who are higher levels than me will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> allow</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me to go on their epic raids and actually group with them. I have played Aelnelda since the beginning of Sep 1999, and I have got through the levels on my own effort (ok, there was about one time a friend did some power levelling pulling for me for about a two hours). In all this time I have had many of these friends say to me &quot;Oh you still at ... level. Hurry up, when you get to .... level you can come join us in ....&quot; Hmmm. You are probably wondering why I am still calling these people friends, well I do. There are always other factors involved in things like this.<br>
<br>
So, even though it is known I will not do my epic, that does not stop me from helping other people out on theirs. In fact I enjoy being able to help people out, especially my friends. You would think that would be the easy way round, wouldn't you? Er, no, I have such a difficutly in getting asked to help out and when I offer I get told I'm not high enough level, it's a guild only thing, or I do get to go with them and I get left out without a group! (To get something cleared here, the places I offer to help out in, I have been before or I know of other Enchanters who were quite successful there. As for the guild only thing, that is never true as there are always friends of the guild at these events). So these days I have stopped offerring, or even sending &quot;hello&quot; tells as this seems to bother them because they are busy.<br>
<br>
Over the past months I have had many many people I grouped with ask me why I have not got my Epic. They are astonished that I haven't even started the quest. They think I deserve it on account that I am good at my class, I like helping people and they like me as a person. As I have now got to lvl 54th (yes, I know it's overrated!) and I have had one or two very good friends on at me to start my epic (plus remembering all the nice things other people have said about it) I decided last week that I might try for it. Today I am feeling that I'm going to leave it.<br>
<br>
I am thinking if I can't even get to help friends on their quests, and remembering the trouble it took me just to get my Sebilis key. I am thinking that there is no way I can do my own epic. I do not want to join a big guild in order to have ready made friends who will help me out: I have been in that sort of guild before, it is not for me. And I would not leave my guild as I adore the people in Legend Ward, they are what has kept me playing this game for the past year!<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong there have been many friends and guilds that have been glad to have my help. Those quests and raids were really great. Thanks guys! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For the time being I think I shall not bother with my epic, and just concentrate on helping my guild mates. We had such a great time in Mistmore the other night, I want to do more of that. I also have r/l committments, so they take priority (as always).<br>
<br>
One last thing, please if anyone does need a lvl 54 Enchanter to help them out, do send a /tell or email me. I would love to come help if I can. (Because of my committments I usually need to know in advance).<br>

I dont know how most of the other epics are structured in truth, but for my own I had 3 things I could do with a small group and then 3 things that took a major raid.  An epic isnt something I could just pick up and do, it was something I accumulated over a great deal of time.  I cant imagine anyone would turn down an enchanter for an epic type raid, and many of the enchanter parts are in areas that are needed by other classes, ie, I know one part is in com, very close to where the magicians and shaman need to go.<br>
<br>
One thing that you might consider is something you said yourself, that you needed to schedule a few days ahead of time.  Parts of epics can be scheduled like that , other parts are instant.  ie, ragefire, the competition is so great and his spawn difficult enough, that when he spawns you have to be there within 15 minutes with a group.  Also, many classes get parts of their epics on normal fear/hate type raids, just like planar armor really.<br>

I would love to be able to do it, the questing is something I love doing. Last week, I thought I could actually make a start, but a few things have made me realise that, for me, it is just not possible. May I remind people, I am no stranger to hard work!<br>
<br>
Planning ahead of time seems to go wrong with me, that gets me down (not always I might add). As for those spur of the moment things, well, I really do not want to go into that here. So I want to concentrate on the things that will not lead me to making myself ill over. Perhaps one day I might pick up the bug to do my quest again. In the meantime I am quite happy to help others and do things for my guild.<br>
<br>
Aavixx - thanks for the confidence vote. Wouldn't I give to be involved more with these quests. Especially since I've put all the work into getting to a level good enough to be of some use.<br>
<br>
Bertrum - Email on way to you. Probably got it by now.<br>
<br>
Aeky - I'm so pleased you got your Epic. I know how long and how hard you've worked for that. Wished someone had let me know you got the chance for Ragefire last night. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Still great news!
