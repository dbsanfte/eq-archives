<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> TITLE:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It's All in the Mind<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> By:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Aaldara Rosolis<br>
<br>
-----The room was dimly lit, hosting no more than two torches for the two doors in the room.  It was cavernous in nature, much similar to the underground home of the dwarves of Kaladim, except the walls took on a more unorganized and crude form, lacking the uniformly measured structures of the dwarves.  The denizens that inhabited this place were also much different.  Gnolls they were called, however they were much different all together from their cousins in Black Burrow and even the former inhabitants of this place.  They were much stronger and wielded magic that almost rivaled the ancestral Erudites.  Upon seeing one they can stand as tall as a human however due to their evolved nature they hunch over.  The place was called Split Paw from the original gnolls that lived here.  Now it could be called anything due to the new residents.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----Aaldara Rosolis sat quietly in the middle of this room meditating.  She faced the door ahead of her, while the door she had just passed through lay directly behind.  She sat in silence, eyes closed, concentrating on the skill to conjure up the fuel of magic known as mana.  Concentration was the key to gathering this fuel faster, however a single nudge from a person can disrupt its flow, thus breaking the chain and enraging the caster.  She recited her memorized spells constantly, not wishing to forget each one.  Her lips moved in a methodical way, quietly pronouncing the same words in perfect tone, repeating again once the last spell was recited.  Any form of interruption would cause her to forget the spell, and in turn it would take her much longer to memorize it from the beginning.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----She finished meditating and rose slowly.  Eyes still closed she concentrated on the spell she wished to cast and began to cant.  The air around her began to move, inviting a cool but supple breeze to her hair and body.  Sparks flew about in the open space, each of them appearing out of nowhere and disappearing.  She canted still, not wanting any distractions to deter her thoughts.  The winds picked up slightly as with the sparks, and now the sparks did not disappear but congregated in front of her swirling chaotically.  This continued until the sparks flooded ones vision so badly they cannot see directly in front of them.  On that moment the sparks stood still in mid air and then exploded.  The winds hit Aaldara’s face but did not harm her.  A sword and shield was produced from the sparks and clanked loudly to the ground.  Done with her spell, Aaldara opened her eyes slowly and looked at the sword and shield.  In that instant they came to life, sword and shield hovered in the air, held by unseen and imaginary hands.  The armed apparition quickly surveyed the room on instinct, then turned to Aaldara.  <br>
<br>
“Greetings master, I am Jitik.”<br>
<br>
-----The tone was hollow, lifeless and monotonous.  However how much can one expect from a summoned being she thought.  These summoned beings are not alive, they know no emotion nor give it in return.  In retrospect they have one thing in mind, it is to protect their master at all costs.  If the master is attacked they try and kill the offender.  They fight to the death, win or lose.  Since they perform this duty so well, they don’t listen to any sort of verbal or mental commands.  They are just on or off, protect or stand still and follow.  Aaldara smiled indirectly at Jitik, knowing it understands her smile no more than an ogre understands how to use the lifts in Kelethin.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----She opened the door in front of her and passed through, Jitik following closely behind.  It was now a dark cave about two ogres wide with no torches present.  The sound of water trickled along the side of the walls.  The walls themselves seemed slimy and wet, but she would rather not touch them and find out.  The air was humid, making her robe stick to her body like wet paper.  A strong, putrid and dank smell of gnoll musk, urine, and feces dominated the area.  She turned around occasionally making sure her pet was still with her.  At this point she envied her pet in the fact that it couldn’t smell or feel any of this filth.  She proceeded down the corridor in what seemed like a hundred paces, or was it five hundred?  She wasn’t sure anymore.  It ended with a slight bend to the right, which then opened up to a room with a closed door ahead.  It was still dark, and this made her worry.  She wondered how these things could navigate through their home without torches but yet there were torches from where she had just came from.  This irked her for a moment until she realized the error of her ways.  She smelled smoke from somewhere in the room, and her eyes went to the source.  There was a torch lying on the ground that was freshly put out.  Smoke was still rising from the doused wood, which seemed to have been dropped and stepped on with haste.  A shiver rode the back of her spine upon noticing this and she started to mentally cycle through her arsenal of spells.  She cursed herself for being so careless.  In that instant a gnoll jumped out of the shadows and clawed her on the back, tearing through her robe and flesh.  She flinched at the pain and landed on her hands and knees.  Jitik immediately pounced in, brandishing its sword to make the offender step away.  The gnoll backed off from Aaldara and howled in a demented, gleeful manner. Another gnoll emerged from the darkness and slashed Jitik from behind with a fine steel long sword.  Jitik swerved around and proceeded to kill the armed gnoll.  Aaldara fought the pain from within and realized she was in a fatal situation if she did nothing.  She got up and began casting, hoping that no other gnolls were present besides these two.  A soft light emulated from her body, with a dozen smaller light spheres that adorned a circular radius around her.  The gnoll who had slashed her took notice and lunged deftly at her, claws extended and mouth agape baring teeth that could kill with one bite.  With the casting finished, her graceful hands made a pattern in the air summoning the powers she brought forth.  With the gnoll only seconds away her spell was complete and pointed at the oncoming offender.  The same soft light that surrounded her bathed the gnoll and it stopped on its tracks, forgetting where it was in the world of Norrath and enjoyed the visions that started to flood its head.  Its hearing lessened to the world and began listening instead to the voices that spell wove together.  No longer could it hear the fighting that was going on, it was hearing much more splendid things.  The gnoll stood there, enraptured in its own world, oblivious to the current situation.  Jitik and the armed gnoll were still fighting, both even in their skills of warfare.  Aaldara looked once more to the mesmerized gnoll and then turned to help her summoned guardian.  Her lips canted another spell, and her eyelids closed halfway to concentrate.  Spherical balls of fire encircled around her wrists much like a bracelet.  It hovered around, growing and getting faster in rotation.  She pointed at the armed gnoll, and a ring of fire rushed towards it.  It clung onto its neck, circling around it while burning the fur of the gnoll.  The rotation then slowed down and the balls of fire started to contract.  The smell of burnt fur enveloped the room, accompanied by the smell of burnt flesh.  The gnoll faltered in step but still managed to parry Jitiks onslaught.  The balls of fire contracted more, and this time the gnoll realized it was having trouble breathing.  The gnoll begins to suffocate.  It yelps for help, but the other gnoll is still mesmerized.  Panic settles in, accompanied by fatigue, and the gnoll buckles to one knee.  It clutches its throat to try and remove the foreign object choking it, but ends up grabbing melted flesh.  The burning pain plus the constriction of its throat make it realize death is near.  It wanted to die now, the pain was too much to bear.  The gnolls prayers were answered when Jitiks sword came raining down furiously.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----Aaldara sighed in slight relief only to find Jitik pounce on the mesmerized gnoll.  She shook her head slightly at the stupidity of her summoned defender.  The gnoll’s catatonic state was broken when Jitik bashed its head to one side.  Enraged at the offender, the gnoll quickly begin clawing at Jitik, parrying each sword slash and bash.  Aaldara realized the gnoll was much stronger than her friend, and began casting the suffocating spell.  The ring of fireballs began circling around her wrists again.  The gnoll anticipated this, and deftly bashed Aaldara stunning her to the ground.  She fell in a broken heap clutching her stomach in pain.  She gasped for air but choked because the pain was too intense.  Her mind began to fog, and her eyes filled with water.  She looked helplessly on as the gnoll reverted its attention back to Jitik to finish it off.  Jitik fought valiantly, but its strength was no match for the gnoll.  The gnoll broke through every defense put up by the summoned being, and now it was faltering.  Aaldara struggled herself up from the ground, dazed from the lack of oxygen to her head.  She was resting on one knee while watching her protector get mauled.  She knew she might die, and decided to cast her only powerful offensive spell.  From her teachings however they painstakingly refrain from the use of this spell.  Aaldara was an enchanter, taught to manipulate the mind and body with benefiting or detracting spells.  She could make a friend swing their sword faster and make them stronger, while making the enemy slower and weaker.  She could ease the mind to make it meditate through the worst thunderstorm, and charm enemies to do her bidding.  The use of these offensive spells was a big risk to the enchanter since direct damage was not their forte.  Many of the spells have been known to do nothing, while other times they cause great mental havoc.  However, the ratio was not on the enchanter side.  Many have died trying to use the spell because the creature did not feel the effects.  When it does affect the creature, great mental instability can occur, resulting in a death of the mind.  She had never used nor seen the spell in use, but at this moment her life depended on it.  She closed her eyes fully, summoning up as much concentration as she could.  Her hands clenched into fists and the words of canting started pouring out of her mouth.  Tears seeped out of the corners of her eyes, due to fear and pain, but she would not falter in concentration.  She heard the battle but could not see what was going on.  She kept canting…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----The gnoll pressed on the attack.  Jitik staggered again, and was clawed repeatedly by the strong gnoll.  The gnoll knew it was going to win, and barked in delight.  Jitik slashed furiously in return but kept missing, its time of protection was at a near end.  The gnoll saw the opening and bashed the protector stunning it.  Then the great claw came down and finished Jitik off.  Jitik burst into sparks once more and dissipated.  The gnoll howled in its glory and turned to finish off the weak caster.  Its mouth opened slightly, snarling at its next victim.  It saw Aaldara on one knee with clenched fists muttering something.  Howling already at its next victory it leaped high into the air, claws fully extended and ready to rip the heart from her chest.  The gnoll drooled, its eyes wide open to soak in every minute, and lusting feverishly to taste her blood in hopes that it would make him magically enhanced like the rest of his bretheren…<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
-----Aaldara heard the gnoll howl and leap but continued to cant.  It would only be a matter of seconds before she would be dead, but her spell was almost complete.  She concentrated harder, her knuckles turned white from clenching so hard, and her eyes felt as if they would explode.  She wondered what death would feel like, whether it would be quick or slow…wondered if they would sacrifice her to the gods or eat her alive… <br>
<br>
-----“YOU FOOL!!” she cursed quietly to herself.  ‘Focus’, that was what she needed to do now.  She was not dead yet.  Her fists began to glow red, pulsating into a larger and deeper red sphere.  Lightning sparks randomly appeared early on and then became more pronounced with every moment.  The red sphere was so concentrated it started dripping from her hands and onto the floor, burning the ground on contact but disappearing quickly.  The gnoll was nearly upon her, only inches away.  Time stood still for the enchantress at the moment.  She could feel the hot putrid breath upon the strands of hair upon her head.  The pulsating blood that ran through the gnolls veins pounded in her ears.  The stench of gnoll musk grew stronger exponentially. In-between the time interval of life and death she experienced all of this, however, she completed the casting of her spell as well.  She opened her eyes, eyes not of the beautiful high elven enchantress she was, but of a chaotic red swirl. Her hands thrust forward faster than the eye could blink and the lighting red swirl of chaos left her hands and entered the gnoll.  The force was so great its body slammed upon the ceiling of the cave and fell down in a heap, bringing chunks of rock along with it.  The gnoll started going into violent spasms and started raking its claws in the air at an unseen foe.  Only the feeling of this spell could be felt once before dying.  What it felt were thousands of needles piercing its body, skin being ripped off slowly while acid was poured into every crevice, bowels being dismembered.  Violent thoughts of pain and torture enveloped its mind, while all learning patterns and experiences melted it into a vegetative state.  All it could know at that moment was repeated agony and torment.  All of this repeated, over and over.  It was a never-ending cycle of slow, malicious, mental anguish.  In an effort to relieve itself of this pain, it started claw itself, trying to force out the demons that enslaved it.  Blood spewed from the deep self-inflicted gashes.  It continued to convulse violently for a while, and because of all the weight put on its mind, its eyes receded back into their sockets and melted into a red puddle of goo.  The gnolls world dissolved into anarchy.  It ceased to move now, pain and suffering at an end by death.  Aaldara breathed heavily, tears in her eyes, but managed to strain a weak smile… she lived. <br>
