<br>
&quot;I Have Crossed The Great Divide&quot;<br>
<br>
When I was very young and hale, <br>
I heard a weary traveler's tale<br>
A savage, brisk and ruthless land<br>
He spoke of with a trembling hand.<br>
<br>
He entered the pub, worn and thin<br>
and took up a chair near the fire within.<br>
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; I asked the man<br>
and he grew silent for quite a span.<br>
<br>
Finally gazing up, his eyes morose<br>
he waved a hand, for me to move close.<br>
As I shuffled my stool close to his side,<br>
he rasped, &quot;I have crossed the Great Divide.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me of this land!&quot; I nearly shouted with glee<br>
for a great tale of adventure I thought to foresee.<br>
&quot;Please tell me this tale,&quot; I did again entreat<br>
He sighed and nodded, as if in defeat.<br>
<br>
In his rolling voice of baritone rumble<br>
He told his story with never a fumble.<br>
&quot;A wondrous land is this,&quot; he did confide<br>
And he began to tell of the Great Divide.<br>
<br>
Scattered trees with crystal branches frozen<br>
no trace of a path man's foot had chosen;<br>
Skies the sapphire blue of a maiden's eye<br>
Made home to the sun to glorify<br>
<br>
One foot set forward, he began his pace <br>
the snowflakes whispering across his face.<br>
the traveler kept warm along his trail<br>
by his brisk, steady trot, and flask of ale.<br>
<br>
But tragedy and pain would begin one night<br>
when a blizzard howled in to rend and smite.<br>
In the ruthless, pelting snow he huddled<br>
His normal keen senses attacked and muddled.<br>
<br>
Late in the night, his ears were assailed<br>
by the hungry howls of many wolves wailed.<br>
Their song grew louder as they drew closer yet <br>
and despite the frigid chill, he began to sweat.<br>
<br>
In desperation the traveler struggled to run<br>
stumbling blindly, his nerves undone.<br>
His muscles weary under the storm's onslaught,<br>
he felt final defeat, and slowed his trot.<br>
<br>
Blood red eyes gleamed through the haze<br>
and the traveler stood still, caught in a daze.<br>
Suddenly he spotted through the storm's thick mire,<br>
what looked like the flicker of a distant fire.<br>
<br>
The strength of new hope flooded into his soul<br>
and he struggled up the side of a snowy knoll.<br>
To his wonder the torch danced atop a huge wall<br>
behind which a fortress stood unbelievably tall.<br>
<br>
Glancing back in the night, he saw the wolves were gone<br>
and he began to scale the wall, towards the torch thereupon.<br>
As he settled close to the flame to warm his blood<br>
He suddenly heard a tremendous thud.<br>
<br>
To his newfound horror and astonished awe<br>
he saw a huge giant as it gave deep guffaw.<br>
Another voice rumbled out in a terrifying bass<br>
and the first giant raised up an immense mace.<br>
<br>
The two glared at each other, in an apparent gauge<br>
and finally one stormed off in a frustrated rage.<br>
Realizing he had not yet been found out<br>
He slipped in a small crevice, and there he hid out.<br>
<br>
With exhaustion he could no longer fight, <br>
he slept the rest of that fitful night.<br>
He awoke at dawn, and with urgent care<br>
He silently slipped away from there.<br>
<br>
(To be continued)<br>
