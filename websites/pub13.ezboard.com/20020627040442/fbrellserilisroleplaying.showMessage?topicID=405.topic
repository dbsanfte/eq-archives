Many things had happened recently which affected Neriak. The Traitorous Daughter of the Dark Father Innoruuk was dead. It was rumored that there would be a new Chosen One to fill the void. With the threat to the stability of the Empire gone, the specter of civil war was likewise removed. Now all the factions of Neriak, from the Great Houses to their Imperial Majesties, from the professional Guilds to the Merchant groups, all moved to solidify their power and re-establish their dominance. House T’Rhennic had been spared the costly and destructive possibility of an inter-house conflict, and could now expend it’s resources elsewhere. That is why the brothers had come together this night, to plan that expansion, and gather themselves together. It was well known that House T’Rhennic had wealth and power, more hidden then seen. It was also known that the members of that House held the well being of the Teir’dal people as one of it’s primary responsibilities. As such, neither Tzlar nor his brother Zirrix possessed items of unique strength or power. Granted, they were both equipped with the finest of weapons and such, but few items of actual wonder. That was about to change.<br>
<br>
Zirrix had recently requested to be advanced within his guild, the Violent Harvest. For most other guilds, one advanced out of the desperation of the guild for anyone with even a meager ability to lead. Not so with the Harvest. The Violent Harvest was almost completely composed of leaders and masters of their professions. No, to be advanced within their guild, one had to perform certain “tasks”. These tasks did not prove skill or worth, those were already taken for granted in all the Harvests members, but they sought to serve certain ends of the guild which the Triad desired. Through the Triad’s efforts, the Violent harvest had become the most feared and hated guild in Norrath. Uncannily, respect and honor had gone hand and hand with the fear and hatred. The Violent harvest had become the stuff of legends, and rightly so. The Triad, being the Ruling Council of the guild, created the agenda for the guild’s activities in Norrath. Their ways were steeped in mystery, but whatever acts they required always served the Empire well. Such it was that Zirrix had been given two “Tasks” to perform. His brother Tzlar had decided that now would be a good time for him to embark on a personal matter as well.<br>
<br>
Tzlar’s alliance with the Dwarves of Thorgadin had yielded many benefits for House T’Rhennic. Mostly in the form of information and ancient knowledge. It was by such information that Tzlar had learned of a secretive underground race that inhabited the continent of Velious. They were called the Geonid, and while they were not truly a race (more like an assembly of semi intelligent rocks and boulders), they were eons old. Through the Coldain, Tzlar had come to learn of an item of  great arcane value. It was a certain crystal, that would act to focus the  magical power of a Caster, and thus allow him to better destroy his enemies. With granting of Zirrix’s quests, which would benefit his guild, the Empire, and all the Respected Race, Tzlar decided to begin his own campaign to gather the Focus Crystal. Deep into the night did the two brothers co-ordinate their plans and future activities. Then, they provided for the security and protection of House T’Rhennic while they were away. Zirrix would visit his Sole Consort, the Battle Mage Mephala, before he left. Both for personal reasons and to inform her of his plans and insure she would guard their family’s interests. Having finished their plans, the brothers looked at each other silently for a few moments, a conversation without words between two who were brothers, rivals and nobles of the Empire. Then, nodding in understanding, each went his separate way, knowing that with their victories they would meet again and celebrate the good fortune and the glory of their House, their Guild and the Teir’dal Empire.<br>
