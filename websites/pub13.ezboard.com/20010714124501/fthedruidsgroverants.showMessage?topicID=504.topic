<br>
In my early years as a druid I remember entering these places and trying to find a group.  90 percent of the time I was turned away, as all the groups wanted clerics or enchanters.<br>
<br>
Now I have finally leveled my secondary Enchanter to 39th level, and she has entered these dungeons herself in search of equipment, groups, and fun.<br>
<br>
All my enchanter has found is crowds, children, and arguments.<br>
<br>
These dungeons are a disgrace.  They are too easy to travel to due to close port location, They have better loot (especially Lower Guk) then they should have, and they are basically safe to a PC who knows what he is doing.<br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
So, therefore I think we need to take these dungeons and make the change to randomize 90% of the rare spawn spots. It makes sense that the boss mob or a few named should stay as placed spawns, but the vast majority should be spawnable at many multiple locations. Get RID of camping.<br>
<br>
Also, Verant needs to finally realize that nothing, nothing, NOTHING brings people to dungeons except LOOT.<br>
<br>
Increase the exp modifer all they want, they will not see a rush of people until it is 200%+<br>
<br>
Loot is the only thing that brings people in, and makes the risk worth it.<br>
<br>
Look at Chardok and Sebilis... both are about the same difficulty, and Chardok is empty, while Sebilis is full.<br>
<br>
Look at HOLE, 20% exp modifier, and old world so Manastone usable... rarly visited except for raids.<br>
<br>
===<br>
I suggest..<br>
<br>
"Chardok", "Hole" become MONEY dungeon.<br>
<br>
* all mobs drop between 5-40pp each.  NEVER DROP CP, SP, or GP.<br>
<br>
* Increase the rate at which money items (Mithril Amulets, Sapphires, Fine Steel ARMOR, etc) drop, say 1 out of 10 kills will be something.<br>
<br>
* Rare drops of Mana-potions.. Instant Cast, Complete Mana-Fill. (LORE).<br>
<br>
===========<br>
<br>
"Howling Stones", "Velkthor's" become CASTOR dungeon.<br>
<br>
* Increase spell drops (51-60) across the board, spells should drop at least 1 out of 10 kills.  Any mob over level 53 should have the same chance to drop a spell from the 55-60 range.<br>
<br>
* Add INT castor loot.  Random Rare Spawns (spawnable at random spots in each wing) with Robes, Belts, Shoulders, Handheld items, and bracers.  Give these items less focus on INT/CHA and more focus on +AC, +HP, and +Mana.  Just as much effort put into making graphics for new weapons, should be put into new graphics for these items.<br>
<br>
* Add WIS castor loot.  Random Rare Spawns (spawnable at random spots in each wing) with nice loot.  items should include stuff we have wanted to see for a while... primary handheld items (Basically a new PAW of Opolla but without minus stats),  A Permenant AMMO slot items that gives Infravision/Ultravision, A CLR/DRU weapon that has a permenant HASTE of 40% and a good Damage/Delay (13/35).  Other items with decent WIS, but also high AC, +HP, and +Mana.<br>
<br>
* More right-clickable items that are CASTOR only.  Some ideas might be ROOT, Fear, and Damage Shields.<br>
<br>
===============<br>
<br>
Sigh...It will never happen.. this would spread people out, reduce camping... basically be logical...<br>
<br>
Verant != logic.<br>

<br>
Anyway *wiping the tears away from my eyes&quot;, Lguk is not just for camping uber loot....  You want loot, go to Velious.  Go to Icewall, and get your warrior full Royal armor, or hit sleepers tomb or Seb.  Guk loot kinda sucks for loot nowadays.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER:  The exps are kickass.  I personally...again, helping others....Powerleveled a warrior in my guild from level 35 to 42 in 4 hours.  How you ask?  Well, he'd just pull 5 or 10 mobs at a time, and I'd keep thorns, Skin, str, and regen up on him....  Most of the mobs would run even before he could take a swing at them!  4 hours, I got that dwarf warrior 7 levels, including 2 hell levels.  That's how good the exps are.  But the loot?  The loot blows.  Maybe FBSS, just so you could sell it for something better, but really nothing else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upaldor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paldor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/30/01 12:00:33 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OMFG!</span><hr size=1> Worry not, here is the text of one of Mr. Boofy's last threads he replied...<br>

&quot;fuckin loot whore. How about exploring those zone for group play, or adventure, or just plan exps to level?? Always loot loot loot with you new noob druids. *sigh*&quot;<br>
<br>
For one, the majority of people don't do this, thats what Paldor's post was about. I dont know if your dense, or just dont read well. Paldor's post isen't even about him looting anything. Its about Verant putting more loot in some of the less popular zones, and maybe taking some loot out of the more popular zones; In an effort to spread people out, and reduce over crowding of certian zones. Theres 20+ zones that can handle players in the level range of Lower Guk, half of these go mostly unplayed due to crap loot.  Some give A+ exp, but as Paldor said, its all about the loot :). If there gonna make a zone thats fairly easy, gives awesome loot, and ok experience at that. Then people are going to camp the hell out of it, like they are now.  <br>
<br>
Just some food for thought, theres a zone that Verant itemized, im not sure if it wasent recently or not. But they added quite a good amount of loot. Including what is arguably the best tradeable clerical armor piece for a certian body part you can get. Ive been there 3 times when passing through, and haven't seen anyone yet. Im not gonna say anymore though. Reasearch it on your own :). Hey, better yet, don't hehe. <br>

<br>
Actually, I find myself the definition of anti-lootwhore...  By doing stuff, such as attending Hate raids and being the &quot;Snare/Ro's Sundering&quot; guy with an extremely low chance of getting any type of loot what so ever, while defaulting to higher level druids who want to attend Fear raids where Vermi drops more common.  No, I do not have 1 piece of Vermi armor, and I'm level 52.  I have a few pieces of ES that I earned in Karnor, as well as a Luminscent Staff I got in Seb, and a few other trinkets, like Herio Crook, GEBs...but all earned or payed for by money earned.  I have never ninja looted, farmed anything for a million hours, or even considered joining a group &quot;for the loot&quot;.  Funniest case I ever had was my level 43 warrior joining a frenzy group in Lguk....why?  Not FBSS...  I already had it...bought and payed for by plain and simple split-looting at the end of a night with a great group.  I joined the group...for the exps..because not only is guk one of the best places for exps from level 30 to 50 (I know...  powerleveled a guild mate from 35 to 42 in 4 hours) but Frenzy is the best place in Guk for the best exps, and the most fun.<br>
<br>
So don't give me @#%$ thinking I'm a loot whore, cause that's the one thing I'm not.  Now exps whore?  Maybe, but that is always shared between my group, so it's more of an exps group whore..  Adventure whore?  Sure..  It's kinda a rush when someone trains 12 dar's on ya and your enchanter mezzes them and you pull out a 12-kill in 2 mins.  But loot whore?  No way in hell.  If you want loot...go hack Diablo.  If you wanna have some just plain old fun, play EQ (and stay away from 90% of the druids)<br>
