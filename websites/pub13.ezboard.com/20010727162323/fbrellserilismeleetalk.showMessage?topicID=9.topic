<br>
I dont really have it all figured out, but here are a few things I have noticed so far. <br>
<br>
First, the more distance I can put between me and the mob, the more likely FD is to work.<br>
<br>
Second, I have to wait till all hostile casters finish casting on me to FD, or the spell will cancel the FD even when successful.<br>
<br>
Third, the more I hit a mob, the less likely FD will work. I dont really understand this one. Maybe someone can tell me if this is accurate.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the more I aggro something, it will be more likely to hang around while I am FD. This seems to vary a lot, is this accurate?<br>
<br>
Fifth, if I jump up real fast after a succesful FD, I can run a few feet and FD again and not aggro again. Does this work on higher level creatures? 35 + ?<br>
<br>
And now a general question, is it even possible to pull and FD with multiple casters at high levels?<br>
<br>
say 35 - 60?<br>
<br>
And finally , off topic, the thing I like doing the best lately, I think this is hilarious. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Aggro something, FD, then jump up every 20 seconds and kick it and FD again immediately(sp). hehe I can do some serious damage and they just stand there it is funny! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'll do my best to answer your questions for you anyway.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
First:  FD seems to be a simple skill check, based largely on your skill in Feign Death, with possible bonuses from some stats, and with a noticeably large minimum failure rate.  I have not seen any log parsers to date, but the &quot;XXX has fallen to the ground.&quot; messages seem pretty much random with about a 1 in 10 chance of happening.<br>
<br>
Second:  True.  Some bard songs from a friendly grouped bard (Anthem D'Arms) also seem to cancel the feign death effect.<br>
<br>
Third:  See First entry.<br>
<br>
Fourth:  Mob camp time also seems to be random, however two mobs will repeatedly return to the spawn locations simultaneously once they get synchronized.<br>
<br>
Fifth:  This gets fairly technical.  Mob aggro is not an instantaneous event, it seems to occur in rapid pulses, maybe one every few seconds.  For this reason, you can run by an alert mob that hates you (but isn't aggroed) and not aggro it, perhaps as much as half the time.  Any time you spend inside aggro range will reduce this chance to zero very rapidly.  This trick doesn't seem to work after level 32 (NOT 35) unless your Ping time is somewhat high.  Then it will...sometimes.<br>
<br>
General Question about pulling:  You need the HP and resistance to withstand the spells, as well as running space, however here's how it's done.  Run around corners or to outside spell range on the caster mobs.  NPC casters will cast on you even if they cannot see you or you're out of range, however they must be near enough to zap you to start casting.  Use this when pulling -- run out of visual/spell range and allow the spells to impact, then feign death.  This way, you can prevent new spells from being cast when you try to feign.<br>
<br>
The Feign Death and kick trick sounds like fun, but upon failure (fallen to the ground) you will get smacked.  Damage reduction on sitting or lying PCs is near-zero.  Anything that hits me when feign death fails will typically hit for maximum damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uokansu.showPublicProfile>Okansu</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fellow of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(6/22/00 5:39:33 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/_images/ultra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Feign Death questions.</span><hr size=1> I havent tried this but I've read that FD fails less if you are in SNEAK mode before you do it.<br>

I still dodge, block and riposte (I think that's what tipped the monsters off that I was faking it =)).   Of course, that's assuming my front is to them.   Even with my back turned I don't take the max hits you take while sitting down.  I don't think the &quot;lying&quot; position counts as sitting.   <br>
<br>
Okansu, I hadn't heard the &quot;sneaking&quot; thing.  One thing I've seen circulating around is that you DON'T have to take auto-attack off, and that if you just time it right you can get feigns off between your attacks.  I haven't gotten it to work, but then again I launch a lot of attacks (level 51 with fbss).     For now, I'll still turn auto-attack off (force of habit from 34 levels of feigning).  <br>

The most important thing to properly pullin at high lvl is knowing the spawn points, and aggro ranges of the mobs in question. The toughest pulls are the ones you havent done before or seen done a billion times. If niether is the case, such as both of the plane raids (hate/fear) that i have done, get a map, and try to find someone else who knows the zone better. I didnt train the raid once in hate, in large part due to Atien's knowledge of the zone.<br>
Back to the crux of fiegn pull on a non planar lvl. Static mobs are the easiest. The trick to getting one is to anger them all and drag them just far enough so that after the fiegn when they go home, hopefully with at least one staring at you a bit longer, one will be left outside of aggro from home and easy pickins. The others will be home and will have &quot;auto-forgotten&quot; you and wont come running.<br>
Mobs that wander through static spawns can complicate this as they usually have a much longer path to take to get &quot;home&quot;. In such situations I suggest letting the static spawns go home and bringing the wanderer alone. (assuming he wont aggro the others, hehe)<br>
The easisest way to pull is to &quot;chain pull&quot;. This only requires the proper distance between the mobs and your party/raid, and a competent assistant. Pull mobs to a set &quot;staging area&quot; and drop. When  one is left, and the others are out of aggro range/home call in your assistant to bring that one back to your cohorts. I have found this method to be fairly successful on fear and hate.<br>
One last tidbit about fiegn pulling that i found handy in breaking phingill and worth remembering. Dying something very similar in effect to a successful fiegn and the mob WILL belive you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
ooh, almost forgot... For any of you who havent been in the hole yet, I found it VERY difficult to fiegn pull in that zone. It seems that any time a fiegn is successful all involved mobs decide at that very second to go home, which of course does nothing for splitting them. I have been down there more than a few times and have yet to split one mob from another once by fiegning. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that they are all summons... but thats just a hunch. If anyone has a clue as to how Fiegn might work in there let me know.<br>
Hope some of you found this informative, and happy hunting.<br>

It has nothing to do with the fact their summuned.

Yea the damage is good, but the other melee clases arent THAT far behind in damage, and they are certainly more survivable during the fight. With the new diciplines and such i thought varent was lookin out for we monks.

There is a simple test without a lot of number crunching that will likely clear this up (I'll give it a shot).<br>
<br>
It works as follows:  Certain spells or bard songs will reliably cancel the feign death effect.  Feign Death near a skeleton and have a friend cancel the feign effect.  If the low level mob hits noticeably more reliably (as they will when you're seated), then this substantiates what I said earlier.  (Unlike several of my comments which are drawn from both personal subjective experience as well as posts by the Great Masters at The Dojo, this one is solely personal experience.)<br>
<br>
If the skeleton cannot hit well, as would normally be the case, then I am wrong.<br>

I'll give this a shot and post the results on this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ufenubsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fenubsy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(8/27/00 4:37:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Monk aggro and FD</span><hr size=1> Just thought I would add something being a lvl 50 SK.

Can I FD pull as a SK yes do I enjoy it not at all.  I prefer to pull like a warrior knowing that if I screw up I can feign and not die or train the party.  Also I am still having to turn off auto attack to Feign.  If I dont the mobs drop aggro on me but when they are done eating everyone else alive they come back and eat me alive.<br>

<br>
but i've found a few situations where i'd keep the SK over the monk<br>
<br>
pretty much the case for all the places where you have a lot of room and mobs hit hard and fast... prefferably without casters ( yeah yeah i know that's true for monks too... but how is the SK supposed to guess that the caster isnt going to start casting on him during the 1.5 sec it takes him to FD ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
with the much better range SKs have ( bows and spells ) you can very often get a FD off before the mobs even get close<br>
<br>
but yeah overall monk's FD is superior to SK's FD to split a tough room<br>
