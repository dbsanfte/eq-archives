Originally posted 5/21/00 on the Vault Network's Brell board, this is one of the most important stories I have ever written about Soul. It explains his true past and shows what he really is. Never posted one of my RPing stories on Brell.net, but thought I would give it a go. Well enough rambling....here's the story:<br>
-----------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
I regained control of my memory and myself for the first time in years. I now knew exactly what had happened to me, my entire past cracked open like a clam waiting to be eaten. Teir’Dal, I was not; at least not born that way. I was born a peasant half-breed, roaming the streets of Freeport with no real cause in life. Many days spent conversing with the bards and monks as they told their stories of far away lands and great adventure. I gave them much respect for that, for they had survived unthinkable horrors and could tell the tale of it. <br>
<br>
Even with my many friends among the various guilds, the place I liked to hang out the most was the Theater of the Tranquil. It was a glorious place that overloaded your senses as soon as you walked near it. The crisp smell of tanned darkwood planks used to construct the mighty stage, combined with the smell of various make-ups used to portray historical figures in the skits hit my flared my nostrils every time I watched a performance. <br>
<br>
After seeing numerous performances, I started to practice acting a little when I was bored. I soon began to dream of being a great actor that would be summoned by courts across Norrath just to see my routine. The first step towards this goal was to, of course, audition for a play at the fine theater. When the announcement for a rendition of the trial of Erud was to take place, I practiced my hardest. Studying night and day, I bought some black market history books from a merchant friend of mine and used them to become as knowledgeable as possible about Erud and his followers. In the end I was very happy, I got the part of Antonicus Bayle - the great leader himself. <br>
<br>
My career at the theater only went uphill from there. I was in almost every performance following that, many involved in the production called me a ‘natural’ and wondered how I could have such a knack for a skill such as this. I was extremely happy with my new found purpose, yet I yearned for more. Secretly, I had dreamt of going on grand adventures, raiding a gnoll stronghold, meeting exotic foreigners, and generally living life to the fullest. <br>
<br>
Eventually, that time came. Rumors had started to circulate among the small group of actors at the theater about the Academy of Arcane Sciences seeking actors for some ‘secret project’. Most of us brushed them off as gossip and thinking, “What would mages want with us actors?” Yet I, having heard bard’s tales of the power of a pure caster’s refined craft, had to explore this possibility of my dream coming true. <br>
<br>
At the next performance, my personal favorite “Oggok Thoughts”, I saw a man sitting in the audience that seemed to be inspecting the actors, almost sizing them up for a battle or something of the sort. He was a physically frail man yet gave the impression of great strength within him. A glorious silken robe flowed around him, with dancing colors and designs that would surely take the heart of any woman. This was obviously a member of the academy, from what I had seen of previous members. After the show was over I approached him to inquire about rumors I had heard. <br>
<br>
“Yes. I know what you require.” He said to me before I got a chance to say anything to him. “We seek a very skilled actor to undertake a dangerous, yet extremely important mission for our school.” <br>
<br>
“But...how…” I tried to interject, having been very confused by his knowledge of my question before I said it. <br>
<br>
“I am a telepath, my kind can read the minds of others.” He said with a very cold, calm look on his face. “I have been watching your performances lately. You are very talented and I believe you are the right one for this task. Go to the transport pad to the academy in one hour and I will explain more.” He stated as he turned his back and started to walk away. <br>
<br>
“I…no…wait!” I yelled as I dashed towards him reaching out to touch the back of shoulder, yet my hand went through a large cloud of bubble-like energy as he disappeared. <br>
<br>
The local merchants were lighting the city torches as I arrived at the stone tablet that was the entrance to the academy. It was a teleporting device used to reach the school, for it floated endlessly by some unknown force about 2-3 stories in the air. I glanced around looking for the strange character I had met an hour ago, but saw no one. After waiting a few minutes I decided to step onto the pad and enter the academy. As my foot touched the stone carving I felt energy rush through my body and my hair stand on end. I then a tearing-type sensation from within me, yet not a painful one like I expected. <br>
<br>
I emerged in a dark room, and immediately felt dozens of arms grab me and shove me to the ground. The ground was cold under my body as the assailants bound my hands, gagged me, and blindfolded me. <br>
<br>
“You have been restricted until we are sure of your loyalty and trust.” An unfamiliar voice stated to me. “I will inform you of our objective and you can choose to accept it or not. Nod your head if you understand.” <br>
<br>
I nodded. <br>
<br>
“We at the Academy of Arcane Sciences are ever seeking to gain more knowledge. Yet, even with the most powerful illusions our enchanters can produce we have yet to become informed on certain areas of life in Norrath. Our mission for you, being a very skilled actor, is to assume the role of another and take on a new life. You could probably refer to yourself as a ‘spy’, yet you will not be doing this to gain an advantage against the people you interact with. It is merely a research medium to further our intelligence of others. We will offer you a variety of different roles to choose, so you may choose one to your liking.” He paused for a moment. “Do you accept this endeavor? Nod your head if you do.” <br>
<br>
I managed to slip the gag out of my mouth and onto my chin. “Money?” I managed to mumble before an invisible forced pulled it back onto my mouth and tightened it. <br>
<br>
The man chuckled at my statement. “You will be adequately compensated for your tasks, I assure you. This school is not a poor one and you have nothing to worry about. Now, do you accept?” <br>
<br>
I nodded. <br>
<br>
“Good. We have little time to waste. Knowledge, like many other things, decays over time and becomes obsolete.” <br>
<br>
I was hoisted up on the shoulders of two men and carried into another room were I was sat down at a table. I was then unbound and a soft light filled the room. The room had no doors and I was alone except for a small stack of scrolls in the center of the table. ‘Read them and choose your path,’ a voice echoed about the room. I grabbed one of the parchments and scanned it reading the life of a troll that mysteriously disappeared into the swamp. He had few friends and nobody missed him really. Dozens of stories just like these I read for what must have been hours. Ones of people of various cultures and backgrounds, all who disappeared without a trace and had few, if any people that would miss them. <br>
<br>
I began to realize how I could take on the roles of these people, yet I would always look the same regardless of how I acted. No make-up I knew of could make one thing I was a troll or halfling. “What of my appearance? I still look like a half-breed no matter what role I assume,” I shouted at the walls. ‘We will handle that part. All you must do is pick one that you would enjoy and that you could handle doing.’ I read back over a few that I had set aside and thought about which I should be. There was this one about a dark elf necromancer that had killed his master and became a warrior, rebelling against all who had tried to direct his life. He was captured eventually and put on trial for his crimes. He was last seen, after his escape from the Neriak prison, running into the desert of Ro. “What of this one?” I asked the invisible person that had been talking to me. He replied, ‘A magician of ours had found his body. He, compared to most, is dead for sure. It is a wise choice if you ask me. Do you pick this one?’ I nodded. ‘We will begin your transformation. Please lay on the table in front of you. Push the scrolls to the floor and lie on your back.’ I did as he asked. <br>
<br>
‘This will probably hurt quite a lot, although it must be completed once it is started. Do you still wish to continue?’ I nodded and the boards on the table wrapped around my legs, arms, and chest tying me tightly to the table. Chants of many casters began to fill my ears as I felt a green aura surround me. <br>
(/ooc I want to keep this message board PG or at least PG-13, so I will snipe the details of the process. If you really urge me I may include it in a later post. Who knows? Hehe 8P) <br>
The boards around my body gave way reveal my new body. My skin was a sleek, dark blue color that only a true Teir’Dal would have, and I was amazed as I surveyed myself. ‘Your training must now begin,’ the voice stated very firmly. <br>
<br>
I spent the next few months training vigorously in two ways. First were my battle skills, the paladins of Marr taught me all I know of swordplay. This was mainly because they were all too willing to exchange battle secrets for knowledge of the militia’s movements against them and the academy had many of those being the neighbors to the guardhouse. Secondly was my knowledge of Neriak and the dark elven culture. Although one of the reasons for my transformation was to learn more of their society, I was pumped full of every tidbit of information they had so far on the Teir’Dal. <br>
<br>
This ended one morning when I was wakened with a start from my bed in the door-less room. “It is time for you to begin your gathering my friend.” Rasup said. He had been the one I had met at the theater many months ago, and was now a close friend of mine. “Ok, I am ready.” I was then escorted to the main audience chamber of the guild. There were at least a dozen robed guild members sitting in a circle meditating. I was directed to the center of the circle and told to stand there. The group stood, joined hands, and began to chant ancient texts. I checked the clasps on my armor as I felt the tearing feeling that I knew all to well as a portal forming. I awoke in on the wizard teleport platform in the desert of Ro. ‘They chose a good place for me to start. It is where this man disappeared and later died.’ <br>
<br>
<br>
Many seasons had passed now, and know now what happened to me. The statue, when activated, mutated one of my characters I played in a production of “Innoruuk’s Minions” many years ago. That new character then took control of my body from the one I had been for some time now. ‘Ghuan’ as he called himself, is now destroyed through the intervention of many. <br>
<br>
This is hard to understand for most, for my mind is unique. I have only been able to compare it to a lecture I once saw in the common lands on the evilness of agnostic people. At this lecture they had a panel of speakers and each one took a turn at the podium. If you were not at the podium, your words would not recognized by the arbiter you were told to be silent. That is how my mind works; I realize that for the first time in my life. <br>
<br>
The statue had disrupted my flow of characters and one took control. Although, the many others who reside within my head saw this and joined together to destroyed the evil one. It is now back to normal, yet I now know the truth of my past. I know that I am not Teir’Dal, not a mercenary, and have no real name. The name of Soulstomper was a mercenary title and I will keep it for that is who I most know this face by. Also, I lost my original name and personality long ago. The one that I am used to and most comfortable with is the one of this “Soulstomper” character. <p><B>Soulstomper Bladehowler</B> <BR>
