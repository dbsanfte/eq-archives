You forgot one thing... murdering.  Guns are used for murder (handguns) more than ANY other weapon.  So don't give me that &quot;guns don't kill people, people kill people&quot; joke... yes people kill people - people with guns kill people.<br>

<br>
My point is, if someone has the intention of killing another human being, then they're going to accomplish that.  Thinking that taking away guns from people that buy a gun for the sole intent of killing somebody will stop people from killing one another is naive and ignorant.<br>

If guns were illegal, then only criminals would own guns.<br>

If you think that as many people would willingly stab someone as would shoot someone, I don't know how to change your mind, other than illegalizing guns, then seeing if murder rates drop (my guess is they will).  Unfortunately, that won't happen because of the NRA.<br>
<br>
Dalmask, how do you know what murderers would do?  How do you know they would go to any means necessary to kill?  Personally... I don't know any murderers, maybe you do - my point is that guns are the most indirect method of killing a person, and, logically, more people would be driven to kill when presented with the easiest method possible.<br>
<br>
True, making guns illegal wouldn't stop some criminals with criminal ties from getting guns, but it might stop some person who doesn't have any criminal ties from killing their ex-husband/wife, abnoxious neighbor, boss, co-worker, etc., because they wouldn't know where to find an illegal gun to get the job done with (would you know where to get an illegal gun?  I wouldn't).<br>

People who leave them out, unsecure or in reach of anyone other than the owner create these accidents, NOT the gun. <br>
<br>
There are numerous ways to safely secure a gun or rifle, no one is to blame except the owner if that security never exists or is breached. Anything from a deposit bag to a multi-thousand dollar gun safe will do.<br>
<br>
This is like blaming a car manufacturer because a kid got in a vehicle and disabled the emergency brake, rolled down the driveway and ran over granny or a baby stroller. Whose fault is it? The vehicle's owner for not securing it properly.<br>

Are you sure?  Really.  Do you know for a fact that people don't fall on a knife or do something unsafe and stab themselves?  I know the answer, and I bet you're wrong.<br>
<br>
&quot;can you find me a news story of a gun SAVING someone's life (besides a cop's)&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't want to go into this realm with me.  My job is mantaining the e9-1-1 database for the entire country.  I know every call that comes in and spend eight hours a day sifting through information.  So maybe I couldn't find a news story, but I can definitely find incidents where a gun has indeed saved a person's life.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dalmask, how do you know what murderers would do?&quot;<br>
<br>
I could ask you the same thing.  How do you know what they wouldn't?<br>
<br>
I will agree with you on one thing...getting rid of guns may get rid of the &quot;casual killer&quot; (I borrowed this term).  That's the type of guy that hates his boss, decides one day to buy a gun and is still angry enough after the background check.  Perhaps if they really needed to put forth that much effort they wouldn't commit the crime, but then again, the same person could be found in their bathroom after plugging themselves into the wall after a nice long shower.  Unstable people are the problem, and people that don't believe they should be accountable for their actions only support them.<br>

Well there is still more knife violence than gun violence by FAR in high schools today.  I think this is because the VAST VAST majority of kids don't want to kill other kids, they just want to scare them (or at least not enough to go out and get a gun).  Believe me though, if a kid really wanted a gun with the current gun laws, it'd be as easy as having their 18-year-old friend who's willing to buy one for you... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udalmaskmhoruahm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalmask Mhoruahm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/25/02 11:06:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17151.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.keepersofthefaith.org/images/KTF_medium.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok, well maybe telling people to lock up their guns isn't enough, maybe we need to make sure they're locking them up... we could save a lot of lives that way.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You don't leave a dangerous object no matter what it is where any child can get to it.  That usually includes knives, lighters, matches and definetly guns.<br>
<br>
In this country, simply put we can't force people to do things as much as you might like.  We can only hold them accountable if they don't do what is expected and/or required.  This country was built on the idea of personal freedom, and despite the fact we do have to limit our freedoms some, we can only go so far.<br>
<br>
If you look at all the stats, from our country to many others the prevailing information shows that gun control laws do not work.  Limiting access changes very little to nothing.  What has not been tried or taken serious are gun responsibility laws.  Laws designed to encourage and punish those who are irresponsible, to require training and some proof you know how to handle the gun safely.<br>
<br>
You can not stop murder by simply taking away guns.  The people who kill people are a problem all in themselves and they won't change because you remove the gun.  And unstable people need to be treated, you can't take away my rights because one person refused treatment or did not get help and he made bad choices. <p><br>

Ever hear of &quot;where there's a will there's a way&quot;? Jensor, I PERSONALLY know 2 Murderers.  <br>
<br>
NOT having a gun didnt prevented them from actually commiting the crimes.  If your that vengeful, hateful or just plain crazed, NOT having the gun isnt going to stop you from doing the deed. PERIOD.  I dont know what fuzzy world your living in, but if it's in your nature to kill, you lack the basic concept of accountability and conscious, your going to kill PERIOD.  Im assuming your referring to wanna-be punks who think they are bad-ass?  but I got news for you, that's only a very small segment of our population.  The way you make it sound, we are living in the wild west where every gun toting citizen settles their disputes with a gun fight ala the OK Corral.<br>
<br>
Nether of the people I know carried guns OR used them in the crime.  One killed with a knife because, in his warped view guns were not practical.  I asked him about why he did it and how. His reasons are not important but,  His response to why he used a knife was: &quot;Only pussies use guns.  they are too noisy and it was easier to use a knife. plus I (he) wanted to get in close to look the @#%$ in the eye while he died&quot;.  These were HIS words.. not mine.  He ended up doing 14 years in prison for this crime and he's out and walking the streets now.<br>
<br>
The other one I know is in prison now for life.  He murdered a catholic priest because he was drunk and thought the priest was coming on to him.  This guy had actually stayed on my couch for 2 weeks 2 months before this crime happened. Anyone in maryland remembers this.. it happened about 2 years ago and last year he was sentenced.   I know for a fact robert (the priest murderer) had access to guns.  he didnt use it on the priest. /shrug<br>

At one point it was said that it is &quot;easier&quot; to kill with a gun than a knife.  Larie said that one of the murderers killed with a knife because it was easier than killing with a gun.

Is that clear enough for you?  I didn't once said it disproved your view of guns, I said it discredited one of your points, which therefore does make it valid.<br>

You can buy a silencer for a gun.  Also, saying that only pussies use guns only helps my argument.  If only pussies use guns to kill people, and most murderers use guns, then if they were outlawed, those pussies wouldn't kill at all - they're too @#%$.  Saying it's much easier to use a knife is just an opinion.  Personally, I think digging into someone's skin with a blade when you are right up next to them, getting blood all over yourself is NOT the easiest way to kill someone, either morally OR physically.  I think pulling a trigger from 10 feet away is much easier.<br>

<br>
Exactly.  Just like saying that it is much &quot;easier&quot; to kill a person with a gun is an opinion.  Not only is it your opinion, but your opinion is also unenlightened.  This person has in fact killed a person, he knows how easy or hard killing a person with a bladed weapon is.  His opinion is backed by experience, yours is backed by speculation.<br>
<br>
And of course I disagree with you on another point...&quot;then if they were outlawed, those pussies wouldn't kill at all - they're too @#%$.&quot;  Why?  It doesn't take &quot;bravery&quot; or whatever not being &quot;weak&quot; in this guys eyes to buy a gun off the black market.  I just takes a few hundred bucks.<br>
<br>
Hey, you did good.  You kept a good argument for a good amount of time, but I think it's about time to just admit to yourself that it's time to move on and find another topic to post on.  I do applaud your efforts though, it was a good debate on a number of controversial topics.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I think about the only thing we didn't touch on was religion.

Look up crime statistics for those areas.  There are a lot of places those statistics are available, I think you will be surprised at what you find.  If they support your case bring them back and post them, if not please explain how lessening gun laws reduces crime and yet we should still strengthen the gun laws.  If you want I will do this and post what I find, but I already know the statistics on this and where I would find them.  I am truely interested in what you find, and from where.  <br>
<br>
Just want to clear up, I am against most regulations on guns, especially new ones.  But I am always interested in what the opponents of my view point think, so if you have time I would really like to see what you could come up with as opposition to what I have read and seen.  This is not to stir up an argument, I try not to argue I would rather debate the point, a fine difference but a difference.<br>
