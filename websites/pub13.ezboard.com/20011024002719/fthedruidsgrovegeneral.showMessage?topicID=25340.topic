Watch backup heals on the chanters and clerics (and other crunchy types), thorns on the main tank, strength buffs on the rogues.  If you're the only druid, it may or may not be your responsibility to snare; you should establish this beforehand by talking to the rangers and necros on the raid (since necro dark will overwrite your snare).  If there's a ranger going of higher level than you, ask her/him if s/he will take snare duty since they'll generate less aggro than you will, being higher level.  Also at a higher level they'll have better odds of landing the snare, and since they won't be sitting the way you will, they'll draw less aggro.<br>
<br>
You can use ONE of the following THREE spells, and no matter which one you use, you should wait until the main tank has had a few seconds to buidl some aggro.  Do NOT use more than one or you will get pounded in to the ground.<br>
1) Ensnare / Snare<br>
2) Ro's Fiery Sundering<br>
3) Fixation of Ro<br>
Which one you use will depend on whether you need to snare (duh), whether you have a lot of melees, or whether you have a lot of people using fire based nukes (wizards/mages/druids). <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

Kat also said it's the same advice as a large raid and it also depends on the kind of make up (class-wise) your raid has.  I totally agree and just want to add that being a druid, you may not ever really know your role until you get in there.  Warriors will just hit on things, wizards and mages will just nuke, clerics will always just heal... but being a druid you will get to diversify a little bit.  You just never know.  :)  <br>
<br>
On the last Hate raid I went to, I was the only druid there and since I wasn't in the puller group or with the main or secondary assist, pack chloro was kind of going to waste on my group.  I did nuke a little bit and snare was not my responsibility that evening.  The majority of my evening was watching out for the enchanters and clerics -- especially the clerics who did not have a backup healer in their group.  <br>
<br>
I didn't learn this trick until a month ago (how embarrassing lol  /bonks herself) so I'll just share it for anyone who hasn't heard it yet either.  This worked really well in the planes.  If you type /target &lt;player&gt; it will target the person if they are close enough to you.  I can't believe I didn't know that!  lol  So during fights I would /target the enchanters and clerics that every so often would get beat on - you'll find that there is usually one cleric and one enchanter that is normally taking a beating for one reason or another and you'll know to target them during each fight.  Keep targeting them and be their back up heal if you have to.  The single chloro spell got a lot of use for chanters and clerics.  <br>
<br>
People were also laughing because I was sowing.  I mean you're in hate -- where are you going to run?  hehehe  But still, some people asked for it.  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Honestly I haven't been on a lot of plane raids so I am not the be-all of advice in this area, but what I can say is don't get too hung up on your level or get worried about having to do a lot of damage... that's not really what you're there for.  I was surprised at how clerics and enchanters appreciated the things I consider trivial -- things like chloroplast and sows.  <br>
<br>
And most of all -- have fun.  :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrairwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brairwolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/13/01 4:10:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Hate question</span><hr size=1> In hate I have found it a very very bad idea to even mem fixation of ro.<br>

Why?  You get the mob you are supposed to be on with /assist maintank.  Then use the /assist to see which member of your raid is getting beat on.  Thia makes targeting crunchy folks very easy, sometimes the only way to do it as they run like sissies.<br>

At 58 I still have some trouble landing our debuffs.  One word of advice, cast the spell (debuff/snare), and if its resisted, wait 18 seconds befire you recast.  NEVER sit down after a resist.<br>

These pointers apply to any Planes raid, Sebilis, dragons, etc.<br>
<br>
1. Check with the target, esp. the main tank, before you cast any buff on them, including spikes.  Sometimes the main tank doesn't want your spikes...especially if there are multiple summoning mobs.   The tanks know all about spikes, and know who to ask for it.<br>
<br>
2. Check with your group before casting a group buff.  Sometimes our group buffs overwrite or prevent other beneficial spells from taking effect.  For example, I warn my groups before casting PoG, so the wizards can all get far away or disband, as   PoG conflicts with their epic weapon effect and they usually don't want it.  <br>
<br>
3. Don't buff for the sake of buffing.  Many of our buffs have better versions cast by other classes, and it's a waste of mana.  Certain buffs also have to be cast in the correct order due to stacking conflicts, and you don't want to cast yours until the right time. And sometimes that minor buff you cast can prevent needed buffs from being cast on the player due to the 15 buff limitation.<br>
<br>
4. The above also applies to SoWing.  As noted in other responses, SoW is not needed in many high level raids, and takes up a valuable buff slot.  Also, most folks at this level have j-boots or some similar ability to get SoW speed, so it's not really necessary.  Of course, there are some encounters with mobs faster than j-boots but slower than a high level SoW where your SoW will be requested...:)<br>
<br>
5. Check with your group to determine if an evac should be ready to cast.  Most often, you won't need it for high level raids, where the philosophy is to die 'n' res in place.  And find out who is going to call for an evac if you do have it up.  <br>
<br>
6. Check to determine if your healing powers are needed at all.  That's a function of your level, the levels of the other folks in the raid, and the number of clerics available.   On a typical multi-group raid, I rarely heal.  I do some prelim buffing, cast ensnare and RFS, and then try to inflict damage.  I do some healing if the mob is totally resistant to any magic, or if we are a bit low on clerics.  <br>
<br>
7. Know who the main assist is in multiple mob situations.  As stated above, make a button with /assist whoever-is-the-main-assist.  Before casting any sort of spell that could disrupt or prevent mezzing, hit that button a few times to make sure that the targetted mob is the right one.  A good rule of thumb is to see if there is any damage to that mob.  This is especially important for DoTs, because your DoT will prevent the mob from being mezzed.  That will piss off the chanter, and they won't cast C2 on you anymore...:)<br>
<br>
If you have any doubts, don't cast.  Or stick with DD type spells where, if you make a mistake, the mob can be re-mezzed.<br>

They're all good things to know for future reference ... but as a level 47 druid doing your first Hate raid (on a raid in which you're the only druid), you probably don't have to worry about *everything* he said since a lot of it won't be applicable to the situation. :)  <br>
<br>
Good point about the thorns, always check before casting it on someone.  And yes, definitely make sure that the mob has taken some visible damage before you cast on it, especially if you're dotting (this is good advice for general grouping, actually).  Actually on raids like Hate where you're killing lots of mobs, I generally stick to nuking so that the mob can be messed just in case some freak accident happens and there's a need to switch targets. <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

<br>
Raid went well.  I hustled around Norrath for a few hours beforehand trying to find a copy of Fixation of Ro before I went but no such luck.  Would've been nice I think since there was only 1 wizzie on the raid, a few mages, but tons of tanks.  Still it worked out nice...was in the group with the mage and wiz so when we wanted to get exp I would just RFS and they would burn it down, insta-xp.  I got 6 blue bubs in Hate, which made me happy since the druid shield didn't drop.<br>
<br>
Still it was great raid experience for me.  Oh, our group was me, mage, wiz, and 3 warriors. (!)  No cleric for us, so I spent the entire time keeping the warrs chloro'd and healing the nukers when they got aggro.  I was terrified about the no cleric part (I can't even keep a warr alive in the Rygorr fort against elites even chain-healing) but the warrs didnt take too much damage and GHeal still works fine with casters.  Died several times but that was later after one of our warrs got switched out with an enchanter....then on bad pulls either he or I would die.  Him from too much aggro or me from too much healing the enchanter. :) I figured I did my job if I died before he did, which I managed to do a few times, although he beat me to the punch a couple of times also.<br>
<br>
So I just Skinned and Strengthed our group (not enough clerics to keep good buffs on everyone in the raid) and healed and debuffed mobs.  Never nuked...would have been pointless compared to the mage and wizzie nukes, and besides I got summoned twice just for casting RFS....didnt get hit, just summoned, and then moved back to the wall.  But I still almost peed my pants first time it happened, never been summoned before (or gravity fluxed, which was an unpleasant surprise, and cause of our only camp/wipe-out....that second floor is nasty).  Thank god there were some high level rangers that handled snaring or I would've died a heck of a lot more.<br>

lol...the ranger helped me out by telling everyone to shut up and stop bugging the trackers.  Still, was a surprise<br>
<br>
Wish I'd known about the thorns...when I had fm I would assist MT, then /assist again and thorn whoever was getting beat on (if I hadn't RFS'd or anything to get aggro).  No one said anything but I hope I didn't mess up people's buffs. <br>
<br>
Also, wish I'd known to make a /assist &lt;secondary tank&gt; button too. :) MT got killed once and I had to scramble to target the secondary and /assist.  Didnt even know what the secondary tank was for until that moment. :)<br>

 You seem to have missed the point.  In hate DO NOT mem fixation of RO.  The taunt factor is insane.  Bad enough that a level 60 cleric had trouble keeping me alive when I cast is up there.  I tried it once after they messed around with aggro/taunt changes related to spells.  I died fast.  Fixation will out taunt ( in hate) 12 tanks.<br>
<br>
Now Ro's sundering is very cool to cast up in hate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uecchu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecchu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/16/01 7:22:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ro</span><hr size=1> Yeah, fixation of ro sorta sucks on raids... besides, in my oppinion, its not even worth casting... most mobs last only a few seconds.  Only reason i ever whip this bad boy out is to hold aggro for some reason or another. great for taunting. in fact, i was able to hold aggro on Dino in oot for the entire time just by casting Fixation + RFS + Ensnare.  Good job in hate though, first raids are always the most fun.<br>

Another exceedingly useful spell in hate is Share Wolf form...  Shrink spells dont work in PoH so all those phattys that get in peoples way.. just make em into wolves, also helps their ATK which can never hurt :)  <p><img src=http://www.a-weston.co.uk/images/Sigfile.jpg>

You're right I did kinda miss that about Fixation of Ro. :) Two different posts said 1) use it, and 2) don't bother, so I figured it was a matter of circumstance.  Don't have it so didn't realize the taunt factor was so insane.  Guess I'm glad I didn't find a copy before I went.   Wonder what the point of a spell is that generates so much taunt even with a ton of tanks and nukers that it equals instant death.  /shrug  Not in a hurry to get it now, anyway<br>

It is if you cast it too soon.  If you wait till a mob is at about 80% life usualy it will stay on whoever has it's attention.  You Cast either Ro at the beginning of a battle and you're dead.  Fixation seems to be pretty much usefull in a single mele heavy group. <p>Batou Thornhill<BR>

Yes it has some taunt ( about the same and ensnare, maybe just a little less) but tanks can taunt things without a problem.  With Ro's sundering I can chain nuke without half the taunt that fixation of ro's gives me.<br>
<br>
Frankly the only real use I have found for fixation of ro's is to really piss a mob off.  That, RFS and snare will glue anything to my butt.  Great if you are teamed with a necro or mage outside.  Have them not have the pets taunt and watch what happens.  I have cast fixation in tank heavy groups and no one can tell the difference.  However Breath of Ro does make a difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usigmund.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sigmund</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/19/01 5:24:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Hate question</span><hr size=1> I know im late to the thread but Ill add one more tip.  When you port up and start pulling to the first room, STAY OUT OF THE FRIGGIN DOORWAY!  People crowding into the doorway get in the way of the main tank and the puller.<br>
