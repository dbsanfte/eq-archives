For example had an opportunity last night to buy one of the velious warsords for 2k it was the 10/23. I currently have a dragon horn yak that I was thinking of swapping it out for, which is 8/23 with the yak proc. I decided to keep yak. For one reason it let's me get my piercing up. But is that two points of damage worth 2k (assuming i keep yak and don't sell it). <br>
<br>
Another Example Iskar scaled gloves, AC: 10 Str: 3 Dex: 3 HP: 10 Weight: 4.0 vs Tolans Darkwood Gauntlet AC14 effect snare, I'm assuming it's a triggered effect. I'm using the Iksar gloves, is it worth paying 2k for the TDG' losing the stats but picking up the extra 4 pts. in AC? All I have is a little over 2K.<br>
<br>
I feel like I'm stuck now, not sure of what to upgrade next. Someone told me in tell when I refused to pay 3K (bought my last one for 2.25k) for a skyfire, telling him that's all I have (2k), &quot;thats all you have and you are a level 45?&quot;. I'm not 45 only 40, not sure where he got 45, but thats beside the point. Am I behind in the cash I should have?<br>
<br>
Or am I fine where I'm at now, and just get ready to work on planer armor. My AC is 757, and I'm around 1200 hp's unbuffed. Wielding a 8/23 yak, and a 10/24 velious warsword, with the raincaller as my bow.<br>
<br>
Let me know what you think<br>

If you're looking for a cheap upgrade that would IMO make a pretty nice difference.. get yourself a pair of DarkMail Gauntlets.  I have purchased like 4 separate pairs in the past few months for 75 plat so DO NOT pay over 125 for these.. If you're patient you can get them for a nice price <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
They are AC - 10 Dex +5 and Mana +50.  I don't think Tolans processes at your level (I think that type of armor processes at level 45 but don't quote me on it.)  That'll give you some more time to save up some plat and by the time you level up that high the price just might have gone down.  <br>
<br>
Also if you are looking to push that ac some as well as your hp and mana.. I'd consider buying a couple Jaded Velium rings.. +30HP +30Mana +5AC.  They are a little pricey but my 53 Shaman gave his +6 wisdom rings away as soon as he got those bad boys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Plus I'm an AC freak and think that 10 ac between 2 pieces of jewelry is pretty damn cool.  I think those rings go for between 450 - 650 each... but I bought a set for 700 a while back.. (damn wish I could remember the name of the chanter who made em for me.) I had sold one of the rings when I thought I was quitting so had to replace that one and paid 450.<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad about being poor.. I suck at rolling on items but have gotten lucky on a couple occasions and have just made some pretty decent trades. <p><center>

I had the Dark Mail gaunts, but got these instead AC is the same decided I wanted the  3 str/dex bonus, and HP's rather than  5 Dex and Mana.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info so far, it helps getting feedback. I plan on questing Ice shackles in the next week or two. But I guess where do I go from there? Will this carry me to lvl46  when I start questing my armor? Do I spend 2k for 2pts in damage? or AC? Is there a value there? In the sense that 2pts in AC will prevent 10% more damage taken vs. 2pts in weapon damage will generate 10% more damage dished out? vs saving my money and getting a lammy for main? <br>
<br>

<br>
You will soon be approaching that point where you will not want to be taunting mobs.  This is something to strongly consider when upgrading your weapons and equipment.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, you would be better off obtaining a non-proc'ing weapon - the 10/23 sword you mentioned would be a better alternative to the dragon horn yak.  The ykesha proc can be a big taunt, as you get closer to 50 you'll realize why this isn't such a good idea.  The better ratio of the velious warsword will make your damage output more consistent overall.  That dragon horn yak won't proc every fight, but the ratio is there for every battle.<br>
<br>
I would not drop 4ac of the Tolan's Gauntlets for the stats of the Iksar scaled gloves.  AC is what will be keeping you alive, the additional few points of str, dex, and hp wouldn't be worth losing the 4 AC points.  (You can always get stat buffs from the group to give you those added str, dex, and hp bonuses.)  The clickable effect of the gauntlets will work at level 45 - but the longer casting time usually means you won't use it unless OOM.  There are very, very, few instances where I would sacrifice AC for stats.  Keep max AC in all available slots, and you'll be much more effective when taking hits.<br>
<br>
As a side note, you could be fighting in Skyshrine at your level... good exp around level 40 I believe.  The sentry armor which drops there is an upgrade for most pieces you are currently wearing.  The drawback is trashing your Dragon faction - but it will build your Giant faction.<br>
<br>
Good luck bro!<br>

I would work on saving up for something at this point. I understand where you are coming from though, as you get into the 40's you are lvling slower so you begin to focus on mucking with your gear more because little seems to be changing.<br>
<br>
To be honest, just stay the way you have things (unless you wins some new loot/get more plat) and work towards one nice new item to make yourself feel good and get a nice new piece of l33t gear to oogle =) <p>Scaleroo Lizziekins

As Scare mentioned above, always go for AC.  The other stats you can get from buffs.  I currently have a self buffed AC of 871.<br>
<br>
I stopped using a proccing weapon at around 46.  At those levels you really don't want their attention.  That's what the plate classes are for.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   A double hitting MOB that does dmg for 100+ a shot need only hit you 5 times before a cleric has to Cheal you.<br>
<br>
As to weapons, sounds like your on the right track.  Pursue AC.<br>
<br>
Not sure about the Giant/Dragon fac, but I hear Dragon quest armor is better.  Check Alakazam for specifics.  As to planar armor, no faction on Norrath really effects Fear that I have found.  Been on 7 raids thus far and only have TV boots and greeves.  Don't hold your breath on those being upgrades.<br>

I'm sorry, I didn't clarify much.  I'm talking about the armor that *drops* in Skyshrine - not the quest armor.  You can hunt there now and pickup the sentry armor which drops off mobs.  I believe the leggings, bracers, boots, guantlets, neck piece, and shoulders are all better than what you are currently using.<br>
<br>
Of the three questable SoV armors, Kael will provide the highest AC... but obtaining this is still a very long way off for you.  (Like 58+.)<br>

ac is probably the most important thing you need as a ranger and increased stats from that armor is pretty much secondary.<br>
If your lucky enough to get high ac and increased stats then you got a bonus. Tolan's effects will not let you trigger them until lvl 45, they do have long cast times but I use my gloves to snare all the time fm or oom. Most of the stuff you will be fighting after lvl 45 will definitly last more then long enough for the glove effect to be used. As far as weapons go you can pretty much use what ever you want after lvl 50 when you get jolt and the increased advantages of using quivers to archery. Get too much attention jolt back out and shoot for a few go back in and chop em up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udabigdumborz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Da Big Dum Borz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 269<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/7/01 1:57:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need your input on upgrading a lvl40 ranger</span><hr size=1> Tot,<br>

I think I'll look for a sword upgrade for the Yak, and Move on to Skyshrine and try and pick up pieces that drop. I don't think I'll invest any money into armor at the current time, but try and save up for a lammy or similar weapon. <br>
<br>
Thanks again <br>

PS I'll continue to check this post for a while if any of you come up with something else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uasanifiadhaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Asani Fiadhaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/9/01 11:16:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need your input on upgrading a lvl40 ranger</span><hr size=1> Thorny Vine Gauntlets are one of the nicest pieces of the Ranger Planar Armor set, and probably the ones that you will next be able to pursue. In my experience, they were the only gloves with stats significant enough for me to accept the ac loss from switching from Tolan's.

Quick FYI don't bother wondering why you don't ever get any Sentry arms; they don't ever drop.  Get Rygorr arms as a replacement to look the same, and get good stats too.  Skyshrine is considered an outdoor dungeon so you can shrink, sow, and harmo if you want to try soloing there if you can't get a group.  (DON'T try killing the first 2 guards.  They are uber beyond their /consider, and never drop anything).  Just kill the sentries where you can.  The sentries sometimes drop guardian armor (/rude) which is what the guardian mobs drop.<br>
<br>
Ry'Gorr armor is also good.  I'll assume you have full ranger quest armor from wherever it is you get it...temple sol ro maybe?  Darkmail gloves are super cheap from the frenzy camp in lguk.  You can get engraved bone pauldrons pretty cheap (12ac 3agl 5dex neg20 cha) shoulders (the quest that generates them is currently broken).<br>
<br>
Getting the ranger armor from Kunark would be the next step after the above goals.  It's got higher AC than just about anything else you can get, and useful spell effects for the most part.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what jewelry you are wearring, but cheap good stuff you can get for a few hundred PP is the 6ac 65hp rings, blue diamond/regular diamond rings for resists, blue diamond earrings for resists, black sapphire earrings for 2ac 35hp 25mana.  You can get a decent 7ac 13wis 13int neck if you can get on a fire giant raid.  When I do FGs, my group looks for (no offense intended here) some noob in zone to loot them if they should happen to drop (no drop).  You can probably pick up a Larikan's mask from Seb for about 200P or so (6ac 10charge sup camo).  Sarnak Hide mask at 6ac 5str is probably the next mask you'd be looking for.  For range slot you can probably get the medicine totem on your own (5ac 5wis).<br>
<br>
This leaves your weapons.  I don't think the wurmslayer is a bad choice of a weapon for your level.  It's pretty cheap.  Besides that, there's really no intermediate 1h slashers besides the velium weapons that will be a decent trasition from yaks to 1:2 ratio weapons like lammy, lupine dagger, jade mace (even though you can't equip.  just listing for example sake), or CSS.  Those all run about 10k in price on average, give or take a few K.  You might want a sword of skyfire, but be damn careful in how you use it.  Enchanters will hate you, and so will your cleric if you don't have good fire resist.  There's also another cursed sword that's about 1:2 ratio that procs cancel magic on yourself.  If you have something that produces an instant icon on yourself (like bracer of hidden, or shrunken goblin skull earring, or jboots) you can use it with fair success. <p>=============================

AC all the way. Pickup any stat boosts as an added bonus but AC is what keeps you alive.<br>
<br>
My gear atm ...<br>
<br>
Primary Melee: Wurmslayer (heavy but nothing comes close to dam until 55+ and you have invigor forregain on stamina)<br>
Secondary Melee: Lamentation (nice ratio)<br>
Ranged Weapon: Bow of Huntsman (quested in Kael)<br>
Ear: Cougar Claw Earring <br>
Ear: Cougar Claw Earring <br>
Neck: Orc Fang Necklace <br>
Face: Cougarskin Mask <br>
Head: Ry'Gorr Chain Coif<br>
Shoulder: Sentry Pauldruns<br>
Finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring <br>
Finger: Velium Fire Wedding Ring <br>
Wrist: Sentry Bracer<br>
Wrist: Ice Forged Shackles<br>
Arm: Mithril Vambraces<br>
Chest: Tree Weave <br>
Back: Lizardscale Cloak<br>
Feet: Sentry Boots<br>
Legs: Ry'Gorr Chain Leggings <br>
Waist: FBSS (ok its not AC but I needed SOME haste <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
Hands: Sentry Gauntlets<br>
<br>
Things I want to upgrade myself are the cloak and the mask mostly. Again for items with more AC. Probably try to lay hands on Black Hooded Cloak and a Tolans Helm. Heh when I regain some cash.<br>
<br>
Good luck anyway bro. And remember we play the best class going. I love my ranger despite the howls of protest from my friends and guildies when I started him!<br>

Stats are good. Hps are good. Sta is good. Wis is good. A.K.A. = It's all good. Go with what you can afford, and what you like. Some people like having super high ac, some people like the stats, its all a balancing act in the end anyway.<br>
<br>
at 49, here's what i've got:<br>
<br>
Cougar claw earring: ac 4 3str 2dex.  cheap, you cant beat it for ac, or stats.<br>
<br>
Ry gorr neck: ac 9, 4 sta, a couple saves. Again, really cheap, great ac for a neck, and decent stats.<br>
<br>
Worked Dragon mask: ac 10, 8cha, 6sv fire.  Great ac, the cha isnt a necessity in the least bit, but it made me hit 100 cha, so I liked it. 6sv fire is a nice bonus.<br>
<br>
Tolans helm: ac 18, superior camo fx. Fantastic ac. 0 stats, and a spell you get at 49. cast time is horrific.<br>
<br>
Silver Glided something ear ring: ac 5, 20hp/20mana, saves, 5 charges of force. Easy n00b quest in LF. Great ac, and good stats.<br>
<br>
66hp/6ac rings. Cant beat the ac for fingers. 66hps is nothing to sneeze at either. Only problem with this is, the more tolans you get, the less stats you have, and you'll itch to find a good item or two to pick up some stats.<br>
<br>
Hero bracer: ac 9, 10str some saves. Another classic, easy to get, cheap to buy, standard.<br>
<br>
Tolans Gloves. Ac 14, fx snare. Long cast time, only real use i've found for it, is to pull, if you want to pull with snare. Nice for when you're camping something green that you dont want to run off, and you dont want to waste mana.  I'd go with Sentry gloves, the ac 12, 5dex/agil/saves pair, if you've got the 1500 or so to spend.<br>
<br>
Tolans Bracer. ac 14, fx summon arrows. No stats, but free arrows for all time!  3dmg ones at that. Cant beat this bracer, hands down, with snare and root, if your archery skill is high, you can solo just about anything you want to (within limits, you are a ranger after all =)<br>
<br>
Tolans arms. ac 18, stinging swarm. Good spell to pull with. Again, the cast time is a little less than nice, but nice arms. Another good arm is the sleeves of the ancients which come from a guy in FM, that you can solo at your level. they're something like ac 16 (14?) 5str and 8 char. Not sure on the stats really, but nice none the less.<br>
<br>
Sebilite Scale Coat. Ac 22, 6str 6wis, 6cha. Great all around chestpiece for a wisdom casting class that can use it. You could go with Treeweave, ac 25, 10str, of course, but i prefer the multi stat bonus in this case.<br>
<br>
Crested spaulders. ac 11, 6sta. There are better mantles out there. The dragon ones that are out now are really nice. ac 13, 35hp/35 mana, and up. Outside of those though, there's not really much to choose from. Obulous death shroud is nice, but 1 less ac, and not really worth the 7k you'll dish out for one.<br>
<br>
Tigeraptor cloak. The cloak for rangers. Simply put. If you can find a tailor that can make you one of these, do it. Stats are similar to this: (so many stats on this one, i really cant remember offhand what's exact)  Ac 9, 8str, 7sta, 6wis, 8 dex, 6agil. Good ac. there's better ac cloaks out there, for sure, but statwise, you won't beat this one.<br>
<br>
TBB. ac 8, 15str. here's my extra str. Would rather have another belt, but havnt really found one I want yet. Spider fur, after the patch looks  nice.<br>
<br>
petrified bark leggings. Ac 18, 10sta, 20 mana, ranger only. Great ac, good stats, ranger only.<br>
<br>
Lodizal boots. ac 14, 7str, and turtle skin effect, which is a 10ac buff. Works at lvl 10+, and can be cast on others. Kind of an ugly boot =), but until i get some tolans, they'll do.<br>
<br>
Weapons:<br>
<br>
/sigh, i've tried so many different combos, its sad. the best combo i've tried that i like is this: Revultant whip in main.  5/14 5dex 4agil (PoH dropped), and Green Jade Axe (17/34, tons of stats, one of which is NEG 15sta). In short, a low dmg, low dly mainhand, and a high dmg/whatever dly in off.  But, that's just me.<br>
<br>
Raincaller Bow. Till you can get one of the newer Velium bows, i'd try to  pick one of these up. quest can be done at your level in a group, i still use mine, and i love it. 21/40 7str/7dex, 5 charges of spirit strike.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's my 2 cents worth. this is what i wear, and i'd suggest most of it to you, unless otherwise noted, and by no means does this mean that i think you've made bad choices if you dont agree, to each his own =)<br>
