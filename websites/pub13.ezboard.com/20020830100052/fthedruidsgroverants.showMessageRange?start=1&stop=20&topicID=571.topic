As of now wizzies are wanted on raids more than druids b/c of their TL.  Easier to TL someone outta Hate than send out a druid and make em port back in and using another expensive stone.  Also wizzies have the ability to QK the same as us.  I know thats nothing new but when ya sorta think about it, wizzies have it a bit easier.  group aoe snare (doesnt last as long but it doesnt matter, they dont need that extra time).  Their AE nukes do tremdous dmg and if they are 50+ the dmg stays the same but the mana cost goes down.<br>
<br>
*i dont want this to seem like druids suck or anything like that, im just trying to figure out if the druid class is slowly being choked off*<br>
<br>
Now in an OS group for example ppl may want a druid over a wizzie b/c of the many things a druid can do, but when you think of a large scale raids how a druid isnt needed b/c our spells can be cast by someone else with greater effects.  Im sorta being paranoid about luclin but *****i think***** that there should be some major kick butt enhancments to the druid class.  maybe new spells that NO one else has or 5 upgrades to pretty good spells we have now, or additions to spells we have making them better.  or hell change somethings in the game.  like making otters in CS and the ulthorks animals.  putting more 'animal' mobs into the game and increasing the power of druidic charms and fears.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now i know that druids are a GREAT all round class!  Ive played mine till lvl 52 so far, and have had a blast, but i feel like im slowly being put into a box this is very meticulously getting smaller and smaller.  I play a 51 Enchanter when my druid cant get a group and i sit awe struck at how fun it is to play an enchanter.  Just a few areas an enchanter works awesomely in as opposed to the druid who has a HUGE range of cool spells but cant go to deep into each spell type.  Dont get me wrong, i love the druid class and some things about a druid, but this suffocating feeling has just been on the back of my head bubbling with thought.<br>
<br>
Reply if you think the same or not, but please dont post saying something along the lines of 'Druids are the masters at nothing, but we are masters at what we do'.  Ive been told that before when i ranted ingame and im sick of hearing it.  We may be masters at what we do but our mastery of this 'stuff' is what im getting at. <p>-Lil-<BR>

bah, we used to be gods in all forms of combat, Pvp, and normal...but then, every single aspect of our power was diminished...then diminished some more...i believe that verant still thinks we are too powerful. but they dont realize that druids cant perform nearly as well as we used to. I mean, we got SERIOUSLY screwed out of new stuff with luclin(hurray, lower lvl group skin spells /) they could have given us some of the stuff that we were rumored to be having(things i heard of were things like lengthening corpse decay rate) or at LEAST given us teleports to luclin. i am not happy having to wait at those damn spires for 15-20 minutes at a time to get there just to buy my wimpy new luclin spells. also, both porting classes got fairly screwed by the luclin portals. now anyone can get to the other continents by going up there and being ported there. not that thats really a bad thing, but still, the boat was there already...anyways, i just think Verant should take a look at how much trouble druids have now, and maybe nerf someone else for a change... <p><IMG SRC = "http://laurenia.homestead.com/files/laurenia_sig_final.jpg" WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=223  BORDER=0></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucloudien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cloudien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#333399>(1/17/02 8:19:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cloudk.clara.net/storage/zidane2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We slowly getting crushed?</span><hr size=1> I think you're right.

<br>
However, I couldnt agree more that aside from the nifty advatages we can get from AA points (which everyone else gets too) we get tottaly screwed with SoL spells.<br>
Natures recovery is nice but limited, circle of seasons and mask of the prowler are both sweet but minor upgrades compared to what other classes get. Im not even going to adress the uselessness of the group skin buffs at 60th. Moonfire is a joke, plain and simple, I dont think ill ever use it expect for when i go solo in Solb or something and even then its mana/dmg ratio is tottal ASS.<br>
<br>
IMO SoL was the time to give us an upgraded DoT along the <br>
WD or even Breath line of spells. Necros and shammans pull way out ahead in SoL DoT dmg what with 2k DoT's over 9 ticks and @#%$ like that. I think a 2k DoT for like 400mana would really help druids get back on track at this point. <br>
<br>
Since that isnt likley though id settle for an apology on giving us such a useless and crappy spell like Moonfire. For all the nerfs that have been done to druids over the past few years I say FU verant. For the dissapointing underpowered additions given to us in SoL I say FU very much!   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uylana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ylana</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#333399>(1/28/02 6:34:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kaeryl.multimania.com/images/Ylana.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We slowly getting crushed?</span><hr size=1> We don't need more f***ing dots (excuse my french) !&#@!

Spells that we should have received in Luclin are :<br>
<br>
1. a small HoT<br>
2. a lure based DD, not as powerful as wizards ones but still something that will make us a bit more useful on high level encounters<br>

It's nice to be able to port my group out of some area and be able to camp.  The wizards (poor guys) sometimes have to stay longer and TL everyone else out.  That can be kind of bad if they TL all the tanks out and something aggros on them :p  I bind my happy hiny in Luclin and then I can gate as needed without worrying about people sending tells saying, &quot;Port to Luclin, k thx&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, we didn't really get screwed as badly as you think on spells.  What I wouldn't have given in my lower levels to have group skin buffs.  That might have saved a lot of mana!  You have to remember, Luclin isn't just for the high levels, it's for all levels across the board.  There might be something out there that could have been better spellwise for Luclin, but I'm pretty satisfied with the ones we have.  And when Moonfire and Mask of the Stalker drop, I'll be even more satisfied.  <br>
<br>
Druids are useful on raids.  You just have to learn how to make use of the skills you have.  You're able to debuff attack/resists/ac, you can regenerate your group, you can back up heal and sometimes even be the primary healer, and you can throw in some nukes.  Druids are still a very powerful and versatile class.  It may not be like it was in the old days where we could kite and DoT things to hell, but I don't miss those days very much.  I enjoy grouping and spending time with my friends.  My short life as a soloing druid was over long ago.  That's not to say I don't solo, but I still think we have what it takes when I do. <p><center><img src="http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/lig/g/r/greenvix/Sig2.jpg"><br><font size=1><a href="http://www.amybrownart.com">Signature Art by Amy Brown</font></a></br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujinjremeadowdancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jinjre Meadowdancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333399>(2/7/02 6:18:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No... We aren't</span><hr size=1> I've been reading similar comments from all the caster types, not just about SoL, but about the high end game.<br>
<br>
Here's the problem as I see it:<br>
<br>
High end mobs are largely MR.  Who is needed?  1 Shaman to buff raid, 1 enchanter to buff raid, bunches o' melee and half dozen clerics to keep them alive.<br>
<br>
Hrm, doesn't say anything in there about mages (who are told &quot;you can come, but don't pet up due to bad pathing&quot;), or druids (&quot;maybe if there's room for you&quot;), or the *rest* of the chanters/shaman, or the wizzies, who become taxi's because their spells won't stick, or the necros who spend their existance feeding mana.<br>
<br>
IMHO, I'd love to see VI implement some completely *melee* resistant mobs.  There is history in the fantasy genre for such beings, which are only energies, thus immune to melee, but fully capable of being hit by spells.  I don't mean a zone full of them either, I mean put some of these mobs in the same zones where the magic immune mobs currently live.<br>
<br>
Then when the raid gets going, any caster with the ability to do damage, debuff, heal, mez, root etc (e.g. all casters) would not only be welcome, they'd be needed.<br>
<br>
eh, just a thought, perhaps a fantasy of mine.<br>
<br>
As for me, I view my job on raids as a chanter lifeline.  I always know who the chanters are and watch for signs of the 'chanter panic' happening (when you see the chanter backing up quickly with the mob in hot pursuit, frequently accompanied by melee saying &quot;don't ping pong!&quot;)  Second to chanter lifeline, my next role is comic relief.  I go on raids to have fun and be with my friends.  I know I'm only there because they like me, not because they &quot;need&quot; me.  It makes me feel better to know that I'm there because I'm loved, and not along because they &quot;gotta have a druid and she's the only one available.&quot;<br>

Since I haven't played a Druid, I may be off on a few things.. so feel free to correct me.  Here is how I see my Class and How I compare it to Druids.<br>
<br>
Wizards Can:<br>
a.) Nuke VERY well<br>
<br>
b.) Taxi VERY well<br>
<br>
c.)  Have minor class balancing skills and spells (Like our AE snare)<br>
This makes us extremely useful in Raids.. but in exp group, Melee do more damage overall.<br>
<br>
Druids Can:<br>
a.)  Nuke pretty good (Some of you 50+ spells do more damage than wizard's do.)<br>
<br>
b.)  Taxi pretty good (So, you can't go to the Planes of Hate or Air, and travel around the one port of Luclin.  Less of a worry than you make it out to be.)<br>
<br>
c.)  Heal (Oopsee, forgot about that one didn't ya.)  In a pinch and with a chanter or bard, a druid can keep up with a pretty fast exp group.<br>
<br>
d.)  Dot (Pretty nice to just root the mob and let time do all the work for ya while you sit and MEDITATE)<br>
<br>
e.)  Buff (Yep, you forgot about those as well.. While not as good as shammy buffs, certainly much better than my own personal buffs)<br>
<br>
f.)  You can MELEE somewhat.  (Once the mana is gone from a wizard, the only thing wizards are good for is running.. and even you druids have us beat on that..)<br>
<br>
g.)  You have ARMOR.  (C'mon druids, the only thing protecting a wizard from a mob are his BVDs, which even when magical don't protect as well as leather armor).<br>
<br>
h.)  Fear spells.  (The only way a wizard can fear a mob is by getting naked and exposing his pasty white (or black) flesh).<br>
<br>
i.)  Charm Spells.  See above.. you think a pasty white (or black) fleshed wizard is going to charm ANYTHING, much less an animal?<br>
<br>
j.)  Pets.  You get a PET.. IT FIGHTS, IT DEFENDS YOU.  The wizard's familiar just kinda looks around while you are getting beat up on.. and when you die, goes of to the local casino with your hard earned plat.<br>
<br>
What Wizards and Druids have in common:<br>
<br>
a.)  Drug to raids that we don't want to be in.<br>
<br>
b.)  On raids, ALWAYS BEING PUT INTO A STUPID "SUPPORT" GROUP.  You know, the ones that NEVER get experience..<br>
<br>
c.)  Complete and total lack of understanding on how effective their class can be if some minor changes were made in an exp group's style.<br>
<br>
Now as far as you complaining about TLing in Air and Hate.. I don't think that there is a wizard in his right mind who wouldn't LOVE to let you have that ability.  No wizard likes Hate.  Why?  Nothing there drops for wizzies?  And guess what?  Wizards get dupped into staying for the WHOLE FRIGGIN' RAID (8 to 12 hours, not counting rezzes, CRs, etc, etc.) because of those wonderful TLs spells.<br>
<br>
And as far as Luclin?  Are you complaining about the one port in the middle of the world that we can TL and gate too?  The same port that we have to wait in line for like everyone else down on the surface of Norrath.  Well, I guess I'll let you run that but I've never gotten an exp group because wizards "are the only ones who can port there."<br>
<br>
Druids are a good, no GREAT class.  So are wizards.. But WIZARDS ARE NOT UBER-DRUIDS.  We can't do half the stuff you can.  Rant all ya want.. but try a class that is closer to your skills.. <p><b>Orakkus Mu'hadeeb</b><br>

a lvl 55 wizard on Mith Marr server<br>
<br>
Hey, you might want to meet my Alt character - he's a_59_wizard_on_Mith_Marr_server.<br>
<br>
5 blues bubbles from 60.<br>
<br>
- us uber-druids have no clue about what others go through tho =)<br>
<br>
And then you may want to meet my monk, and my rogue, I also use a cleric a lot, so I really don't know anything about them. Chit while we at it, I may as well pull out my Mage also, we should have fun then.  Then of course there is my Paladin, he's such a kidder that guy, he says he sucks but darn I know better then that.<br>
<br>
- anyhow Mr_55_Wizard_on_My_Home_Server - we haven't got a clue of what we are talking about - we just like to moan and whine about things without backing them up with facts or our own experiences.<br>
<br>
And to set the record straight, my wizard is not a twink, twink means my main would either power him or "give him items that he can't get himself".  <p><hr><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00" vlink="#00FF00" alink="#00FF00"><div align="center"><center><table border="3" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#008080" bordercolordark="#000000" bordercolorlight="#008080"><tr><td valign="top" width="100%" background="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/images/sobe/back.gif"><p align="center"><font color="#80FF00" size="4" face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Sobe Silvertree</strong></font><font color="#FFFF80" face="Trebuchet MS"><br></font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"</font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Sobe" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Wanderer</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">" and "</font><a href="http://www.geocities.com/kibadachi_uk/epiclink.htm" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">1st Tunarian Protector</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">"<br>Elder Hierophant of </font><a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Guild Afterlife</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><br>Administrator of </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove" target="new"><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Druids Grove</font></a><font color="#FFFF80" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"></font></p></td></tr></table></center></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uorakkus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orakkus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333399>(2/25/02 1:24:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/ivan02/EQPic/Sigpic/sigpic_04.jpg width=140 height=140></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We slowly getting crushed?</span><hr size=1> Well, I talked with Sobe and he enlightened me about my post and that alot of it is the frustration since SoL came out.

NO high end guilds are looking to recruit druids unless they have 0.  <br>
<br>
EVERY high end guild will take a high lvl wizard or shaman or cleric or whatever other class druids get compared to.  WHY?  because wizards get db and gb which allow them to do extremely powerful dmg to uber mobs.  shamans get malo and slow and a heal that heals more than druids top heal.  uber mobs are impossible without malo from a shaman unless you want to settle on mala from a mage and without slow unless you want to settle on enchanter slow.  and clerics well duh, they heal the best and res.<br>
<br>
so people say druids have cool skills, and i admit, i enjoy being able to do a little of everything, but in terms of feeling useful, i know that i am not.  if we disappeared on raids, it wouldn't matter.  the only time i'm missed is in tov simply cus of our fire/cold resists, but it's not like other classes can't also provide fire/cold resist buffs, they're just not as good.  that is the only skill in which we excel.<br>
<br>
someone mentioned charm animal.  um, you must be kidding me.  do you realize that only unnamed, low lvl mobs are considered animals?  bats, wolves, bears...  unless i'm lvl 15, this really won't help me.  think we can charm plants?  well only if the plant is under lvl 35.<br>
<br>
pets?  my pet has like 100 hps lol.  i buff him as best as i can, but i can't solo anything that's high green or above.  the only thing he can tank is lvl 20 and below.  it's not mana efficeint to use him even.  only when i REALLY don't feel like doing much, then it takes much longer to kill mobs when i could take them out in a nuke.<br>
<br>
healing?  well obviously clerics should get best heals, but now shamans (one of the other most important classes in the game) have a better heal than us in that it heals more hps.  yes, it won't work for the MA on a big mob, but in terms of back up heals, it's far superior than druid heal.  they gave us superior heal in kunark, then decide to give it to shamans.  they give both of us chloroblast.  and now paladins have almost as good of heals!  of course that's fine cus no one expects a paladin to heal them.<br>
<br>
buffing, well, i think potg is probably the best spell we get, one of them at least.  however, NO ONE wants potg on raids because aego is much easier to do and lasts a lot longer.  clerics get mad that i ask for symbol instead of aego.  i have to leave the room when our clerics do aoe aego cus it will override potg.  they really should just have potg STACK with aego.  what harm would that do?  it's not THAT many more hps.<br>
<br>
and now shamans have group regrowth that actually out does our ROTG.  gee, shamans aren't over powered or anything.<br>
<br>
porting, um, now that wizards can tl, druids are not even needed.  it's convenient to not be harassed as much for ports, but again, demoralizing to be considered even more useless.  and now wizards can self tp to the nexus, grrrr, not fair.  i hope druids suddenly adopt wizard technology and are able to self tp there too.  i don't care if it takes me 12 points to get the skill, i'll do it.  someone said something about not having to stay around at the end of raids cus wizards can tl, however, there wouldn't be much of a wait if druids could do it as well.<br>
<br>
mask of the hunter and it's friends.  well i thought our self mana buff was super cool, until clerics got one that was WAY better than ours.  hp/ac + 6mana per tick is far superior to druid mana buff.<br>
<br>
our epic, well it gets resisted by high lvl mobs if there is no tash or malo on them.  i'm talking about like in tov.  it can take me 10+ tries to land the thing.  of course this is fine because they made the druid epic insanely easy, but if they hadn't fixed faydedar, the thing would be a pos.<br>
<br>
someone mentioned our armor.  i just wanted to say that every class as planes armor.  every class has 3 different velious armor sets.  yes, int casters don't get kunark armor, but kunark armor sucks anyway.  you really think having low ac armor with no stats and a lousy effect helps us?  our velious armor is fair at best.  the ac is still extremely low which is fine i guess.  we have a really stupid effect on our pants.  a 28? second port to misty.  i might be wrong on the time, i can't remember off hand.  um, i could mem and cast the spell faster than the pants cast it.  the only reason i go to misty thicket is to bank and that's not that often.  the bp effect is cool, rotg is nice, however, you have to be grouped to use it, /targetgroupbuff does not work.  sow boots are neat although.<br>
<br>
the coolest spells we get that i can't complain about is group camo, spirit of eagle, and levitation.  of course you can't use /targetgroupbuff for group camo and there are several velious and luclin zones that will strip that levi right off.  and of course there's the fact that most of the luclin zones seem to be indoor only, making most druid spells useless.  and levitation and soe have a lvl limit so i can't cast it on people low lvl who ask me for levitate.<br>
<br>
aoe, i don't quad kite for xp, but having the ability to aoe is nice.  unfortunately, the druid aoe dmg spells are outdoor only, so we could never join an aoe group in a dungeon unless it's to heal or snare (which wizards, rangers, necros, and sk's can do) or root (which a lot of other classes can do as well).<br>
<br>
AA.  our AA sucks so badly.  mass buff group or whatever is cool for circle of seasons, but i doubt i'll use it for anything more considering our shamans always do the aoe regrowth and no one wants potg.  and all the priests get this skill, so nothing special for druids.  then there's instant invis which i suppose could prove useful, but nothing to get excited about.  then the 2 evac ones which i dont' remember the difference in atm, but on raids, you don't evac anyway.  then there's dire charm which sounds really cool until you realize that you can only charm animals and there are no animals in dungeons besides the bats in sol b that i can think of off hand.  so if i want to go to nk and charm bears, i'm set.  i can't remember the other skills atm, but my point is that the skills are utterly useless for the lvl they are able to be attained at.  at lvl 59-60 which u must be to use these skills, you have very little use for them.  oh enhanced root was another one....i guess this is ok.......um....i don't root uber mobs though.  i do use root when xp'ing though so i guess that's good.<br>
<br>
turning off the rain....gee, i've used this skill maybe 2 times and one of those times it didn't work.<br>
<br>
dmg shields....mages get better.<br>
<br>
wolf form....who cares anymore?  they made it so dragons will kill you in the form and placed dragons in outdoor zones, so wolf form is again useless.<br>
<br>
dots...shamans and necros have better dots now.<br>
<br>
cold nukes, our highest one only does 746dmg?  can't remember exact number, but it's nothing to talk about.<br>
<br>
wildfire is a great spell, 1024 dmg, but again, nothing in comparison to a wizard.<br>
<br>
ro's fiery sundering, good de-buff, never resisted except on fire mobs.<br>
<br>
the fr/cr one i can't remember the name of is very often resisted so i never use it.<br>
<br>
i can't think of any more skills lol.<br>
<br>
/sigh....after that mega-rant i guess i'm through for now.  my point is that our skills SOUND cool and we get a lot of them, however, they are mostly rendered useless when other classes with the same and better skills are around.  we are often the second best in areas, but being second best means diddly when the first best is around.  people often tell me they LOVE druids, but i know from xp that we are not missed on raids, meaning, if we weren't there, the raid could continue without any additional problems.  now, if an ench (speed,mana buffs,tash,dispell,debuffs,runes,slow,etc.), cleric (buffs, heals, ressing), shaman (malo,slow,focus,rh,other buffs, pr/dr resists,heals,dots, debuffs, regrowth, etc.) monk or sk (fd pulling), warrior (they HAVE to tank), rogues (DMG, picklock), wizards (DMG, DB, GB, TL's), sometimes paladins (Brell's, centering mobs with DA, and taking death touch, plus they can take a lot of dmg), sometimes mages (dmg shields, mala, coth is important with faction systems and now focus items), necro (ok this one is kind of hard to, make a case for but they are good at feeding mana! and dmf for pr mobs), ranger (good dmg much like rogues and wizards and coe, cop, etc. are important buffs), bst lords (i don't know enough about them),  bards (aoe mana/regen, aoe resists, attack songs, haste songs, etc.) all of these classes have a skill that could make or break a raid.  of course there are always ways around it, but not so easily.  druids, the only thing that makes them important on raids is the cr/fr buffs and if a mage isn't around dmg shield and if a wizard isn't around ports out and if a shaman isn't around regrowth.  sure back up heals are nice but is 880 hps really worth the mana it takes for a cleric to do a complete heal?  yes chloroblast can keep a warrior alive for a second longer for a cleric to get a cheal off, but it only goes so far and shamans can do it too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utinsi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tinsi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#333399>(3/30/02 7:19:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We slowly getting crushed?</span><hr size=1> &quot;necro (ok this one is kind of hard to, make a case for but they are good at feeding mana! and dmf for pr mobs)&quot;<br>

- Mind Wrack. 2 necros in a caster group against caster mobs. *drool constant full mana* Mind wrack is awsome!<br>
<br>
- 500 heal over time for 10 (ten!!) mana at level 54. Nothing that can be chain cast, since it drains health from the necro, but still a pretty decent backup heal.<br>

- AC/str/atc/sta group buffs that also at the same time debuffes the mob accordingly.<br>

<br>
Just browsing through some of the older rant threads when I saw this. Some of the things I've seen have seriously disturbed me. This thread, though, has to be one of the worst.<br>
<br>
Breathe slowly. Close your eyes. Breathe slowly. Open your eyes. Say this phrase.<br>
<br>
&quot;My class does not suck.&quot;<br>
<br>
This isn't some self-motivation tool. This is me helping you come to grips with the truth. All of the things I'm seeing as complaints are nit-picky. <br>
<br>
<br>
Laurenia said : &quot;also, both porting classes got fairly screwed by the luclin portals. now anyone can get to the other continents by going up there and being ported there. not that thats really a bad thing, but still, the boat was there already...&quot;<br>
<br>
Welcome back to the dirty, unwashed masses. Do I wish that Druids could teleport to Luclin? Yes. That would make life much, much easier for me. Does it really inconvenience me that much? Not really. Basically, this says, &quot;Waiting for the boat isn't so bad.&quot; But you know it is. That's why Druids make money. Because waiting -sucks-, and people will sit around in GD paying 150pp for a teleport to Iceclad because they're -lazy-. And you know what? If waiting for the boat isn't so bad? Then waiting for the Spires to fire isn't so bad, either. <br>
<br>
<br>
Lildarie said : &quot;As of now wizzies are wanted on raids more than druids b/c of their TL. Easier to TL someone outta Hate than send out a druid and make em port back in and using another expensive stone. Also wizzies have the ability to QK the same as us. I know thats nothing new but when ya sorta think about it, wizzies have it a bit easier.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's two news flashes. News flash the first - Wizzies are wanted more on raids because of Manaburn. A Wizzy without Manaburn is as desirable on a raid as a Druid. And that's not me being cruel, that's me illustrating a point. There are a hell of a lot of classes that aren't needed on raids. They're nice to have, they flesh out groups and can make raids more successful, but nobody ever said, &quot;We don't have enough Necros on this raid, time to go home.&quot;  Look at it this way. You get passed up for a raid? Fine. You can go Quad. Your mage friend will get called to the raid to mod rod, will sit around basically doing nothing, and think to himself, &quot;Man, being out soloing would be better than this.&quot; But then he'll remember... oh, wait... he can't solo. I hear your cries. But they're not a unique plight.<br>
<br>
And news flash numero dos. I hate to break this to ya', but I, as a Bard, can solo circles around you. -Circles-. As in I can solo any non-summoning mob in the game around my level post-27 in as large a number as I like with no downtime. Soloing is not your exclusive realm. And, as a matter of fact, it never has been. So, complaining about Wizzies is just Wizzy-bashin'. Because they aren't the ones stealing your thunder.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lildarie also said : &quot;*****i think***** that there should be some major kick butt enhancments to the druid class. maybe new spells that NO one else has or 5 upgrades to pretty good spells we have now, or additions to spells we have making them better. or hell change somethings in the game. like making otters in CS and the ulthorks animals. putting more 'animal' mobs into the game and increasing the power of druidic charms and fears.&quot;<br>
<br>
What the... are you serious? First of all, you already have spells nobody else has. Secondly, you -did- get upgrades/additions to spells with SoL; just because it's not that useful to you as the 60 00b3r doesn't mean that it's not useful to druids as a whole. And Jesus Christ, why don't you just increase Druid power across the damned board and give them KEI, Torpor, and a quad-hitting, BSing pet. You're not lacking on solo-able mobs. And, for your information, nearly everyone got hosed with Luclin. Spend more time there and you'll see it. The encounters are laughable, the loot is hardly worth the risk anywhere, and a majority of the content is useless timesink after useless timesink. You wanna' talk about someone that got hosed with Luclin? I got one song, -one-, that was useful. Amplify, level 30. To go alongside the little ditty I can fire up to eliminate my hunger when hungry. =P<br>
<br>
Look, this isn't a troll, but jeez, folks, get your panties out of a wad. I think the fact that the Druid class is the most widely-played class in the game, that no Druid has ever lacked for cash post 29, that you can solo fairly easily, that you can get in raids as easily as a Necro or Beasty or Bard, and that you've managed to convince Verant to drop the healing penalty of all things is pretty telling. Sure, you're not this anymore...<br>
<br>
Laurenia says : &quot;bah, we used to be gods in all forms of combat, Pvp, and normal...but then, every single aspect of our power was diminished...&quot; (Renbeny says : Har!)<br>
<br>
...but it's not the swan song, you're still alive and kicking, and as bad as it gets, hey, you could always be a Paladin. =P<br>

That's not the issue, so adding those facetiously to the list is in itself a reflection of your poor understanding of the current needs.<br>

Actually, where is your proof? <br>
<br>
Most druids who played the class to 55 or 60 have moved on to other raid-essential classes. What you see now is the most loyal, the most stubborn who play druid MAINS and have since EQ's release. The number of visitors to this board has decreased over the expansions. Certainly, each new expansion brings more pageviews, but the number of regulars, old timers, and visitors has dropped due to the fact that druids are in some ways a neglected class. Verant has not wanted to upgrade druids for many expansions because they wanted to avoid any increases in soloing power, but with so many classes being able to solo now, soloing isn't the huge issue it used to be.<br>

However, I think the issue with migration to new classes has more to do with the age of the game as opposed to the class itself. Every class is suffering the same turnover, simply because even the die hard class members are getting bored with their characters after this much time. It's not just limited to &quot;problematic&quot; classes - clerics, enchanters, rogues, shamans, people are just making alternates.<br>
<br>
I looked at my earlier post and thought it a bit troll-ish. The druid classes do have some legitimate complaints, but a lot of what I see could be chalked up to boredom or being discontented. Really, why would anyone want to raid? At the level of play that most players play at, they can easily get loot that suits their needs with pick-up groups in the standard places - Sebellis, ME, etc. Most people just enjoy raiding because its something to break that afforementioned boredom. A lot of us raid regularly and only own one or two pieces of raid loot that we actually were there in order to help farm. It's the experience. Being denied that experience just because other classes are better-built for situations like that sucks, I know. But if you're bored, I guess the only solution is to do what everyone else is doing and try out another class, as horrible as that might seem. <br>
<br>
In a perfect world, all the classes would be balanced, all the classes would be raid-friendly, and being forced to make an alternate would not be a viable option to being able to experience certain things in the game, especially considering how much time people have invested in their characters. But you can look at it this way - even if you could do everything you ever wanted to do with your character class of choice, you're still missing out on a huge chunk of content in the game. <br>

Correct me if im wrong - but if i was right, they couldn't make a druid on luclin because there wasn't enough wildlife/plants/water or something similar to that to draw the power from to create a druid portal..<br>
<br>
or was that something regarding the Vah Shir :S <br>
