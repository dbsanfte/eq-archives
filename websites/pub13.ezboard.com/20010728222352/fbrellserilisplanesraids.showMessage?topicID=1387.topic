When we DO come to a vote, and doubtless we will, we need to consider HOW we phrase the vote.<br>
<br>
For example, in the course of this discussion, I'm sure we will have a situation whereby some people will agree that FG's should be scheduled 24/7. Others will say 2 days a week. Others still will say not at all.<br>
<br>
Well, it is hardly fair if the vote turns out: <br>
<br>
Option 1. Reserve FG's 24/7<br>
Option 2. Reserve FG's 2 days a week<br>
Option 3. Reserve FG's not at all.<br>
<br>
In essence, the vote will be breaking up those who favor reserving FG's and leaving the &quot;FCFS&quot; crowd once again as a united voting front.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I think it's important that we talk about a mechanism whereby we find that it's helpful/necessary to add new mobs to the reservable list.<br>
<br>
For example, suppose everyone resolved that for now, leaving Phinny and FG's as reservable, due to their &quot;planes newbie/training&quot; nature.  However, later on, we find that CoM is starting to get raided a LOT and some people are stepping on toes. Or, even more importantly, the very highest levels are starting to get crowded again. (It will happen. It has happened before and the area is finite.)<br>
<br>
When demand exceeds supply, conflicts will happen. It happened on the planes, and we fixed that...when do we decide it happens elsewhere.. (PoG very soon, for example.)<br>

If there are enough people who want to see Phinny or CoM or Chardok reserved, but not an overwhelming majority perhaps we could designate 2 days a week as &quot;reservation days&quot;.<br>
<br>
The most conveniant way to do this would be to have the same 2 (or however many) days be reservation days for all the disputed zones.  For instance have Sunday and Monday allow reservable raids for all the zones which people vote they need reservation times and the rest of the week is First Come First Served.  This way it's easy to remember when they need to check the board and when they don't.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that none of these zones should be reserved, there just aren't enough crowding issues in any of these places to warrant it.  However, if the votes are split fairly evenly this might be an acceptable compromise.  Just an idea. <p>-<a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=998">Maryinn</a>

Look how many guilds reserve them and want to raid them.  It's still a good starting point for young guild and young raiders to get a 2 to 3 hour multi group raiding experiance.<br>
<br>
Reserve Phinny as many people/guilds want to raid it like the FG.  Do a 2 week max sign up like planes.  I imagine 75% of the days would still have no reservation on it.<br>
<br>
CoM and Chardok: Maybe Fri-Sunday as reservation days.  Other days FCFS.  My initial thought but open for other ideas.<br>
<br>
Also, should be pointed this isn't to reserve the zone, only specific mobs.  Like FG, people reserve FG but there are still groups in there fighting Window, King, Bats-n-Bugs, ect.  Thats common sense but some lack that around here. <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>  Posts: 1852<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/20/01 1:47:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/itsme.jpg height=153 width=142></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Evaulation of &quot;Reservable&quot; Zones</span><hr size=1> No to all 6.

<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Oh well, maybe I'll respond here to the people from the Phinny thread.<br>
<br>
First, let me start with the arguments I've seen in several weeks of talking about this.<br>
<br>
Why NOT to reserve something. Wait a sec.. let's make it interesting.. 10 (if I can find them) most popular reasons why NOT to reserve something.<br>
<br>
10. Removes the spontaneity of the game.<br>
<br>
9.  Because people can now do those mobs and don't require organization.<br>
<br>
8. Get some friends, you losers. &quot;I can find enough people to raid X mob w/out even asking anyone from my guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
7. Other servers don't reserve mobs, and they're just fine.<br>
<br>
6. &quot;The game is working as intended.&quot; (IE, w/out reservations.)<br>
<br>
5. If the mob is taken, just go find another one.<br>
<br>
4. &quot;I don't want to have to check my daytimer, everytime I want to go kill a mob.&quot;<br>
<br>
3. &quot;Just because.&quot;<br>
<br>
2. Most have epics involved which makes it even SLOWER to get your epics.<br>
<br>
And the #1 reason why NOT to make mobs reservable IS!<br>
<br>
1. If we reserve one thing, it's never going to stop and everything will become reservable!<br>
<br>
Now for the annoying part.. rebutting the damn things. I've only done it like 3 times in other threads.<br>
<br>
10. &quot;Waaa!&quot; Okay.. minus the sarcasm, the game is extremely spontaneous as it is. You rarely know exactly what you're going to do when you log on.  Even the most elite guilds have to plan a large raid. Why is it okay for them to plan a raid on a plane, but it's not okay for a smaller guild to raid Phinny?<br>
<br>
Cuz it's reserved? Oh yeah, that's right. But that's what we're trying to do, reserve a few more mobs for the same reasons the other stuff was reserved.<br>
<br>
9. Right. And as it happens, what people are basically saying is that back when they needed help and organization, it was okay for them, but NOW, that they don't need it, well, let's do away with it then. Why is that? Is that not an extremely selfish and self-centered attitude? Is that what Brell is about?<br>
<br>
8. See 9.<br>
<br>
7. No, they're not fine. Do we want to become what others are? If not, I highly suggest those people who can MOST benefit from FCFS now, watch your backs. People won't be level 35 forever. And they WILL remember who set the motions for FCFS.<br>
<br>
6. Sha.  Verant has many reasons for stating that. For one thing, they don't WANT to police every server. That costs MONEY. They do what they can with as little effort as possible.. thus, things like the PNP come into play. They encourage people to police themselves. Sometimes it works (Brell) sometimes it doesn't. (Veeshan, and others.) I don't think anyone on Brell is a big fan of &quot;uber&quot; guilds, and I don't think we have ANY in fact. (By definition, I would think an Uber guild is not a euphemism for &quot;big guild&quot; or even &quot;powerful guild&quot; but rather &quot;own the server&quot; guild... But that's another topic altogether.) Since we DO police ourselves, voting on things like this is what makes Verant's &quot;Working as intended&quot; statement true. As opposed to some casual aside of &quot;Let's do whatever the hell we want, cuz Verant says it's okay.&quot;<br>
<br>
5. Could be a good point. Except, there are few mobs with that same &quot;je no se quois&quot;. In other words, at level 45, phinny and the FG's have very few comparisons. You can't just take 18 level 45's to the Lord room in Guk. You can't take them to SolB, or even Karnor's.. (well, with the exception of the hand/warlord room, but that's hardly a raid.) They'd prolly get creamed anyway. Not to mention, the fact that FG's and Phinny are a TIMED spawn which means what they have is VALUABLE, giving a completely different aspect to a RAID than a simple dungeon crawl to Guk or Droga.<br>
<br>
4. For one thing, it's not every mob. We're talking adding a few mobs to the list. I also think that most people WILL be able to work out a compromise of some sort. Perhaps making weekends the only time for reserving mobs. (Hey, if you are so slick you can do any mob with six people, you don't NEED weekends to reserve the mobs.)  Additionally, RE: the &quot;checking the daytimer&quot; .. that HAS to be faster than sending your local druid over to the dungeon in question to see if the mob is taken. I don't care if it's as little as 15 mins to check a dungeon.. unless someone is IN that dungeon, checking a board is faster.<br>
<br>
3. Yes, I've heard that as a reason. Typically it's phrased as &quot;I vote no.&quot; with no reason or justification behind it. Talk about conservative minded. I mean, I'm a republican, but that's taking conservative thinking (backwards, closeminded, whatever label you want) to new heights. Open your ears and minds, people.<br>
<br>
2. Not really a valid  reason, since that point could be argued both ways. B/C it's involved with an epic, more fights will evolve over said mob, and as demand exceeds supply, conflicts will DEFINITELY happen. Just remember those cabbage patch dolls from the 80's. Man, you saw mothers fighting daughters, grammas leaping from wheelchairs. What a scene. <br>
<br>
No one is saying we can only kill a said mob, once a day. No reason we can't update the FG's so that we can kill them twice a day. Ditto on Phinny.. perhaps even three times. If the demand for reserved spots gets so high, then we know we took the right track. If not, at least we are doing the right thing for people who need reservations.<br>
<br>
1. I find this the most pathetic excuse of all.  I mean, c'mon. Talk about doomsday prophecies.  No one has of yet asked (at its worst) that all mobs become reservable, yet people are just automagically assuming that that is what's going to happen. No reason.. no logic. Just jumping to conclusions. So we never reserve another mob, because next thing you know, orc 1 in EC is going to be reserved... words fail me.<br>
<br>
Btw, I'm mostly for Phinny being reserved. I had to nod in favor of Adune's and Sindarre's reasoning (from the previous post started by Kruunch) in regards to the spawn times of Chardok, CoM, and the other reservable mobs. If it's only a few hours, then it really starts falling into the &quot;normal camp spot&quot; timeframe.  Eight hours, however, is one excessive camp!<br>
<br>
My fight has mostly been about Phinny. I'm even amenable to having it just two days a week, provided we leave the option open that if those slots get used a lot, we can expand it.. (to 3.. maybe to.. gasp.. 4?) eventually. <br>
<br>
Let's BE openminded. Let's BE Brell.<br>

Some of course with only a few days like Maryinn first proposed on POG in one thread.  With what all there is to explore, I don't see an issue with reserving a few.<br>
<br>
As for FG's, FG's are becoming more popular lately.  I've been looking in that folder for over a month and nearly every day has been scheduled.  I think they should be scheduled throughout the week still and not a few days out of the week.  Quite a few guilds that are now to the levels of using them as a raid.<br>

I mostly favour FCFS, but I would support a semi reservation on FG's &amp; Phingel.  Heck, probably even the royals.  If it were yes/no, I will vote no to all of them.  So from my perspective, the semi-reservable vote is splitting the FCFS vote up.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't see it as splitting the vote on either side.  It's a reasonable compromise that I find acceptable.  I only ask that it goes NO FURTHER than this however.<br>
<br>
What Nillon is referring to is a system I came up with for doing the rotation type mobs.  (Naggy, Vox, VS, Trak)  It was based on giving every 18 people a raid of their own.  Not based on your guild, or your Indyness.  That way, the length of the rotation would reflect the number of people interested in raiding that mob.<br>
<br>
At the heart, it's asking for raid leaders to be accountable, &amp; show that they represent a portion of the server in order to get a raid spot.  The thread's somewhere, who knows how far back. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub76.ezboard.com/udexn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dexn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 252<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/20/01 6:28:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Evaulation of &quot;Reservable&quot; Zones</span><hr size=1> Ahh, gotcha. (Adune) I was actually somewhere promoting the idea that you'd have to be guilded to reserve a raid. And then only one guild per rotation. Then, tack on the fact you have all of 48 hours to actually do any rotational spawn.. voila. They get done faster, and by the guilds.<br>
<br>
I don't think an indy (who represents one) should have the same ability to reserve a dragon, which is impossible to do with anything less than 18 (much less the 10 required for a guild.)<br>
<br>
Additionally, it's much easier to account for someone's guildtag than it is to come up with 18 people. Of course, I'm not against that idea either. I'd certainly vote for it. We actually came to similar conclusions thinking independently <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Who'd a thought it... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

First: my basic criteria for reservability discussions (having these is not sufficent, but sets a floor).<br>
<br>
-raid requires 2+ full groups of lvl 50 assuming average skill<br>
-includes special mobs on longer timers<br>
-reaching these mobs requires some effort<br>
-evidence of friction in getting spawn<br>
<br>
Second: I think the insistence that the discussion be &quot;all/none&quot; is not helpful.  <br>
<br>
I am in favor of _SOME_ reservability for phinny.  (some people have posted that they have tried to arrange raids only to arrive to find him gone.  I have some sympathy for this, and based on my count of the reservation/intention boards there were in fact more posted phinny raids than firegiant raids) I do not support full time reservability for phinny.<br>
<br>
I am in favor of dialing back fire giant reservability. (given the above, that there were more phinny intentions than FG reservations, I think dialing back reservability on FG would be a good step.)<br>
<br>
Based on the data I gathered on hole, CoM and Chardok, I did not find sufficient intentions posted to support any reservation periods.<br>
<br>
I have no opinion on POG, not having raided there. <p>Cartumandua Spiritslammer

I like to live by the KISS principle (keep it simple stupid). <br>
<br>
FG - Stay as are<br>
Phinny - Reserve Fri-Sat (maybe Sunday too)<br>
Hole and CoM - don't think any system needed everytime I go there for epic mobs never seen an issue.  Short pop time.<br>
Chardok - No Oppinion as I haven't been there and have no idea. BUT, I never saw more then 1 or 2 people posting that they were going to go there.<br>
<br>
PoG - Man, hard one.  1-2 day reserved is what I like most so far.  Let people organize huge raid endevors on weekend, rest of week FCFS.  I don't think this plane is still getting used heavily.  I only know of 1 guild that goes there a lot.   <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukeyanaubaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keyan Aubaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/21/01 11:11:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Evaulation of &quot;Reservable&quot; Zones</span><hr size=1> KISS system is by far my favorite as well<br>

All these zones really need is a willingness to walk in and either compromise with whoever is there at the time or come back later when its empty. Anything else is overkill. <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

<br>
Phinny, Hole, Chardok, City of Mist... No reason at all to reserve these. They are largely untouched. They are a really quick respawn (relative to the BOSS mobs we do schedule). The argument can be made that &quot;So what then reserving them won't matter then.&quot; Well that argument can be made for every critter in the game. Nothing is really gained by reserving these. They are so widely uncontested and free it is just another layer of control that will yield little return on effort to schedule. <br>
<br>
Sure they have epic pieces but the epic pieces are (possibly) coming into the world on these within as little as 2hrs and at most 8hrs. I would say 2 weeks is a very reasonable time to get a epic piece in the grand scheme of things. Some of these will have potentialy spawned 168 quest pieces in just that two week period. The worst case (phinny?) will yield 42 potential drops in just that two week period. I just don't see the OPPORTUNITY for getting these pieces slipping questers by because they are not scheduled which means epic pieces on these is a bad reason to schedule them IMO. <br>
<br>
That leaves POG. POG has it's own discussion so I will refrain from rehashing all the proposed solutions here.<br>
<br>
Is this type of stuff (just a few examples) really necessary?  <br>

PoG need be reservable everyday i think and may be 3 week in advance.<br>
For the other zone may be sunday monday and tuesday will be enough.<br>
<br>
Like a lot have said these zone are free VERY ofen. So make them reservable will not spoil the ppl that just want be able to gather and storm the zone.<br>
The ONLY thing they will need do is to check the reservation board before (2mn MAX !) and see if the zone is free or not (9/10 the zone will be free).<br>
For all the other people it will make raid this zone lot of easier because you can schedule a raid being sure that you will have the zone. <br>
If these zone are not reservable you may have one day 2 raid fighting for spam, ranting calling PNP and so... and 6 day these zone deserted. <br>
With reservation you will have 2 day of good raiding and 0 problem but the little need to check one board 2mn when you want do one of these zone ! (AND it seems easy for this player to change of hunting zone so if they see that chardoc is taken they can easily go to velketor lab, WW or skyshrine or even CoM if CoM is not reservable)<br>
<br>
I really think that the advantage are FAR more important (making the zone doable for more player and more used)  that the disadvantage(need to check the board 2mn) that for me allow any kind of reservation on this zone seems obivious.<br>

My &quot;Waaa&quot; was immediately followed by stating that I was being sarcastic. I suppose you could equate that to someone saying they don't want to use a daytimer to see if they can raid a mob, no? Wasn't that sarcasm?<br>
<br>
IMO, someone being selfish and self-centered are in themselves, being disrespectful. Additionally, I phrased it as a question. I left it up to the reader to decide if it was indeed selfish and self-centered. The actual quote was (in context)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
what people are basically saying is that back when they needed help and organization, it was okay for them, but NOW, that they don't need it, well, let's do away with it then. Why is that?

<br>
I don't find that disrespectful in the least. I'm making a commentary about how it seems the opinions of some people of Brell have changed.<br>
<br>
Encouraging people to be open-minded is disrespectful? I would think open-minded people would agree with me, no? I know *I* have been open minded. I've downgraded my own desires from wanting most on the list being reservable 7 days a week, down to having Phinny reserved on weekends. I'd say that's listening to logical discussion, respecting other people's opinions, and keeping an open mind, wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> . I find this the most pathetic excuse of all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suppose this could be considered disrespectful. However, the problem here is that I'm talking about what people are saying.. nay REPEATING over and over again. I'm tired of hearing a lame excuse used as a reason for not bring honest and good change to the server. It IS pathetic if people can't think up original ideas to voice their own opinions. Finally, I'm talking about what someone is SAYING. Voicing my opinion on THEIR OPINION. I'm not using a personal insult at all. I am not saying that whoever says such a thing is a pathetic excuse for a human being. I am saying that <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Is a pathetic excuse. And it is. No disrespect intended.<br>
<br>
I hardly think nitpicking a post for interpreted disrespect is conducive to constructive compromise. I encourage you to find a single insult in any of my posts. I'm not sure, but I don't think I even use them in Rants.<br>
<br>
Finally, I apologize if my creative (or some may say, not so creative) use of sarcasm egendered any feelings of disrespect in my posts. Typically, I leave out the sarcasm, but I find few enough people commenting on the posts anyway. I'm beginning to feel that I'll use whatever tools necessary to invoke a response.<br>
