I'm surprised silk swatches go for 25-50pp each, are you sure thats accurate?  In anycase, the economy as it stands in terms of low lvl to high lvl trade is very poor if all you can mention are bear skins and swatches.  I'll point out again the current ability for a high lvl to farm any low lvl item 10x's faster w/o the hassle of looking for what they want 1 by 1.  And fact of the matter is item balancing isnt as out of whack as most of you are portraying it to be, since none of you are dying to get your hands on aton of items that drop in low lvl zones.  Most people that want low lvl items want them for looks.  I agree though that Verant balancing the items to not be as good or even close to higher lvl items is the key.  I stated that in my earlier post, and if Verant does put in low lvl items that have better effects/stats than high lvl ones(and it was 'intended') then Verant screwed it up, although the concept is still a good one imo.  I'll wait and see instead of automatically assuming Verant will put in Uber items for low lvl players that higher lvls will die for.  I think Verant already knows their on shakky ground with high lvl players by introducing this 'nerf'.<br>
<br>
Scirocco- Well, i intended that statement to mean more along the lines of soloing and grouping, because that is a choice you have in most games.  Verant doesnt really give you much of a choice, especially in the high lvl game.  That was my mistake though, since the statement you quoted from me is very ambiguous and can apply to a number of things.  My bad :(<br>
<br>
ButeauRegalis- I'm not sure what the current revenue figures are, but i am sure that they will decline as better mmorpg's come out.  AO is a bad example since it clearly came out as a poor product.  SoL HAD to come out, just so Verant could retain people that might have left because they had exhausted EQ in its current state(people like me, and it worked :-(), also they needed to be able to compete with the new games.  Dont get me wrong, EQ wont die tomorrow, or even within a year or two, but it will slowly wither away.  I'll admit i got carried away with that quote, but if you took the whole paragraph with it, you would see that it applied more towards the fact that the high lvl game doesnt have many options to advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alot of how the Anti-bottom feeding code works out relies on Verant.  Make no mistake that the concept can be a good one because it keeps the lvl of difficulty for reward somewhat consistent.  Its just that alot of it relies on the balancing aspect as many of you have mentioned.  Also, i'm very curious as to how Verant plans on segmenting whats considered bottom feeding.  Maybe its been announced already, but i dont think a place similar to Droga with an item like The Idol should be considered bottom feeding to a lvl 55, and even maybe higher.  Droga is still very dangerous for me even though almost everything is green.  Plus, i'll take the other side and say that an item like the Idol of the Thorned is an Uber item and therefore higher lvls should be able to camp it.  So if they base the bottom feeding code based on green con, then i believe Verant screwed up.  They would be forcing more and more people to find groups in Karnors or OS.  Most people arent gonna do some big raid into DN or some far off place thats of appropriate lvl for them.  I believe Verant needs to segment it from something like 15 lvls below you, maybe  less if they got the item balancing right.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, for the most part, i dont see why everybody is making such a big deal out of it.  So what if Verant screws up and puts in a few items for lower lvls that you might want?  I mean i'll say Verant screwed up abit, but i wont say they never shoulda put it in.  The money you can make at higher lvls, as well as the items you can acquire should get you that item from another player easily.  When that newbie offers you aton of his low lvl crap for that decent item item you just picked up, now you might want to think twice before laughing at his offer.  I swear 99% of the time i got trade offers from ANY lower lvl, i pretty much knew i was gonna reply 'no'.   Because i had been in their shoes and done the same exact thing.  What people farm at lvl 25 were the same things i was farming at that lvl.  I would make the same exact offers to higher lvl players knowing damn well those high lvl players could just as easily walk in and acquire what i had with little to no effort.  Its a joke trying to deal with higher lvl players in terms of item trades.<br>
<br>
In closing i think many of you are right in that Verant can really screw the game up if they screw up implementing the code with item imbalances.  I believe Verant can really screw it up by segmenting the code too narrowly.  I dont care too much if they want to throw low lvl players a bone and give them an item high lvl players might be interested in like that crown from Runnyeye.  I could easily trade or buy one with no problem whatsoever.  I guess the thing i'm most concerned about is how they want to force people to explore areas that arent crowded by using the bottom feeding code to do it.  Maybe they'll redo the low lvl dungeons to higher lvl dungeons like they said, as well as give easier access to them.  That would offset what Verant takes away with the anti-bottom feeding code.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see how competent Verant is.....<br>
