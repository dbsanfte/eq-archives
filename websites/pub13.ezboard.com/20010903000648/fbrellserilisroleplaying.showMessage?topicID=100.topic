Days spent studying the texts of Tunare and whatever arcane literature he stumbled upon.  Of those 200 years, there was not a day that didn't pass where he questioned how strongly his faith in Tunare was, or those around him for the execution of the Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fletop.  Today you are 300 years old, and I am hundreds upon thousands years old.  And I pass this heirloom to you.  Every Family in Norrath has one of these.  It allows you to travel the lands, explore the unknown and quell your wandering and adventuresome heart.  Without these, Adventuring would be a shorter riskier career.  It is the Adventurer's Stone.&quot;.<br>
<br>
With those words, his Father opened his shirt and quickly sliced out a side of his stomach.  Blood began to flow out from his side, but with a quick word under a grimace of pain, the wound closed.  The bloody mess in his hand quickly dissolved into a burning red gem.<br>
<br>
Fletop's eyes grew wide.  &quot;What is this Father?&quot;, he asked with apprehension.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is what has allowed me to adventure forth into the world without Fear that I will not be able to see you again.  It is what I know your Mother also holds within her for Thorondar.  It is what every Adventurer has.  Some call it an Adventurer's stone, others a Life crystal.  Yet others, such as Trolls and Ogres have no name for them, yet pass them along in their cultures.  All the intelligent races of Norrath have these embedded within them at some point.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It bonds with your soul, and your life force.  If you are slain somehow, before your true time, it captures and steals your memories, your experiences and regenerates your body.  When I explored this great lands with your Mother, we both had these, given to us from our parents, allowing us to tread upon the land knowing that were we to die, our lives were still not at an end.  That we would regenerate where we were last soulbound to learn from what we had experienced and to conquer.&quot;.  The old elf sighed and paused.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then how, Father, does this not stop all of the elves from conquering the rest of Norrath?  Why do we not just raise our troops and take the rest of what we want, take their Life crystals and ... ?&quot;, quipped Fletop.<br>
<br>
The old elf chuckled as he reached out and opened the boy's tunic.  Reaching out, he pressed the burning red gem into the boy's sternum.  Pain flooded into Fletop as he tried to keep from screaming.<br>
<br>
Visions of swords flashing in the darkness, he saw his mother... younger than the way he knew her now being held by her throat, lifted off the ground by a vicious looking troll, laughing as she struggled.  The vision cluttered as he saw his father's hands before him crackling with power, blasting the troll to drop his mother.  Another figure entered the fray, a dwarven warrior pounding and hacking away into the trolls.  A sharper stab of pain as the vision looked down to see a claw protruding from his chest... feeling his vision fall to the floor, a pool of blood forming around the floor about him.<br>
<br>
Fletop screamed.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
He awoke sometime later, his Father looking over him with a silly grin on his face.  Fletop had never seen his father like this, usually he was brooding.<br>
<br>
&quot;The stone is both a blessing and a curse Fletop.  Yes, it renews the body and the mind, but it keeps the memories of all the deaths you have and the deaths of those who have had it before you.  Some elves are able to never remember those deaths.  Some more sensitive to power remember all.  Control your mind, and you will control what you want out of this stone.  The experiences I had with it, and the deaths that I suffered with it are yours now, and no longer mine.  When you die or are killed while in possession of that stone, you will regenerate here in Felwithe.  Later, when you learn more advanced magicks, you can change your point of regeneration, as I can, and as your mother can.  But now, when I die, I will rest in Tunare's light.  You carry my legacy now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Be warned though.  Although the stone regenerates you, your possessions are left where you died, along with your former corpse.  The sight of your own death is a grisly one indeed, and you must steel yourself against that vision or go mad.&quot; cautioned his father.<br>
<br>
&quot;So then... I am invincible now!  Wherever I go I need not fear death!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay son, you will fear it.  Each death comes with a penalty to your abilities.  And the pain is unbearable.  Your sanity is what constantly lies at risk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, we are late for dinner and your Mother will be cross for having to wait.&quot;<br>
<br>
