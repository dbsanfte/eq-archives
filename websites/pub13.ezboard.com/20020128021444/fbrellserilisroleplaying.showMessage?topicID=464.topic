But what they didn't realize was that I had pledged myself to Innoruuk at an early age.  I was his tool, and I would<br>
eventually break those that considered themselves to be my betters, and I would walk across their broken carcasses to bask in the power that is Hatred.<br>
<br>
I knew who my mother was, and who my father is.  My mother had been a whore at the Maiden's Fancy, my father killed her when she gave birth to me, a female.  My father is the last living male in his family, he had wanted a boy-child.  He got me instead.<br>
<br>
We Dark Elves don't have children like the Light Races, a male Dark Elf can seed two children in his lifetime, a woman can only birth one.  No two children have the same parents, and somehow we manage to avoid interbreeding.  Most of the time.<br>
<br>
At times, blood grows thin, and someone's mind cannot live within the insanity of our Hatred.  And thus they either become so insane that Innoruuk calls them to serve him directly in the Plane of Hate, or they<br>
turn to the Light.  It is beleived that my father walks on the far side of insanity.<br>
<br>
After my birth, and my mother's death my father brought me to his guildmaster.  He offered my life to Innoruuk, for the garentee of a strong, worthy heir.  The priests of Innoruuk assured my father that the god had heard his prayer, adn was pleased by his offering.<br>
<br>
They also told him that the proper place for a sacrifice was with the Unholy Knights and the Necromancers.  My father took me to that bloody guildhall and laid me upon that gory alter himself.  Turning his back on me, thinking his fortune and family name would be secured by a male child, he left me there.  Thinking I would be dead come the rise of the moon.  But that was not Innoruuk's plan for me.<br>
<br>
I did not cry as I laid upon that cold alter, the Shadow Knights and Necromancers knew that this was the time that Innoruuk would either mark me, or kill me.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk chose to mark me.<br>
<br>
I grew up in the halls of the Lodge of the Dead, serving the true leaders of Neriak.  Watching the Powers behind the Clerics of Innoruuk, I grew to despise the petty intrigues of the city.  My childhood was torture and work.  I was tested and tested again to see if I was truly worthy of the Mark of Innoruuk.  Learning the meaning of Hatred, and finding it within myself.<br>
<br>
It had originally been decided that I was to be trained in the Necromantic arts, but it was too easy for me to slip into the bloodlust of the warriors and pick up a weapon.  Yet my Hatred had grown too strong for even that.<br>
<br>
It was shortly after my 9th training year that everyone agreed I would be a Shadow Knight.  It became my duty to walk the lands of Norrath, filling hearts with Hatred, and introducing them to Fear.<br>
<br>
So I stand, straddling the line between sanity and insanity.  I hold my Hatred close, like a lover.  I jealously watch for someone to try and take my place as the Mark of Innoruuk.  <br>
