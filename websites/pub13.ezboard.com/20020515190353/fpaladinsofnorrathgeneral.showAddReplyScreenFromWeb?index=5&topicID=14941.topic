Your solution would make things worse. As it stands now, many of the better items, or quest items drop in dungeons or remote locations. Low and mid level people hunt in the relative safety of the outdoor zones. Saving their copper to buy the dungeon items higher level people farm in mid level dungeons. The pattern repeats itself as some of these 'noobs' grow up, farm the dungeons (that are now easy to them) and sell to the new 'noobs', or give to alts.<br>
<br>
They could 'nerf' outdoor loot, but this would really hurt the people who like to solo.<br>
<br>
Personally I think it would help a lot if you put mobs outside dungeons that are slighly easier than the mobs just inside. PCs will come to the entrance to hunt and as more people join the group, they'll eventually be able to go inside.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, the most populated newbie/lowbie dungeons are like that. Blackburrow, Splitpaw, and the Crystal Caverns, all have good mobs outside for a partial group to hunt while waiting for more people to show up. By contrast, SOL A has nothing outside that would challange someone who wants to go in. Who wants to sit around lavastorm on the off chance a group of players will show up? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usenchy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Senchy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/02 5:16:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14941.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to get Noobs into Dungeons....</span><hr size=1> Good points, Cylria. <br>
<br>
Having slightly weaker mobs outside dungeon would give people that want to dungeon fight something to do while waiting for others. KC works that way pretty good where people can fight in small groups outside and zone into KC to check for a group.<br>
<br>
More loot in dungeon should be made nodrop. That way you avoid farmers clearing profitable dungeons and entice players to go to dungeons. Key is a better assortment of loot so pickup groups form easier. Best to have each named mob drop either a caster or meele loot of equal level. <br>

Pathing/Aggro issues indoors, and the increase in difficulty of corpse recovery.<br>
<br>
For example, I have been in LGuk recently. Monday night my group made its way to the Assassin/Supplier room. Just as we were getting medded to pull, someone ran through and pulled EVERYTHING...  trying to take it to the zone. Yes, that's right, they pulled it right through my group... which meant we had to fight unprepared. Then, once the other group realized that we took all of the trouble out of the equation, they ran into the Assassin room. They let our Warrior up the ladder and blocked it off with a Troll...  so he died and they claimed the room. We took all the risk, took all the XP loss, and who got the reward? This kind of stupidity does not happen in outdoor zones.<br>
<br>
Last night we were pulling mobs in the same dungeon, and instead of the single/double pulls we were getting all of a sudden we are getting 8-10 with every pull. Seems there's an aggro problem with bard songs, so our bard was on EVERY hate list in the zone.<br>
<br>
And lastly, corpse recovery has to be changed in order for people to go into dungeons. If they had a new rez that offered zero XP returned but allowed you to spawn safely with your gear, people wouldn't mind going into dungeons so much. I would trade 35% of the XP I would have gained with a rez for saving an hour of corpse recovery. Hell, I could probably make up that 35% in the hour if given the chance. And if they did this with the classic &quot;money on hand&quot; disappearing when you die in this manner, they would have a very effective money sink to balance the server economies.  <p>Dyermaker Merdinho -- The Lost Paladin and Lil'Bastard<BR>

I SO wanted to hunt in Droga with a group. Heck, I STILL want to hunt in Droga (sounds like a challenging place to hunt)! Problem is that because so many people stick to these familiar zones all the interesting dungeons are empty. <br>
<br>
The simple problem to farming is keeping the dungeons active. Take Sol B for example. On my server Sol B is almost always active with some experience group camping almost all the spawn points. This is GREAT because when you see a 60 come in and do a camp check for lower spawns (say K/P/C) it's taken by experience groups and they leave. No hard done, great!<br>
<br>
There have been so many Kunark dungeons I've wanted to do at the proper level (Dalnir &lt;sigh&gt;) but just couldn’t. Either there is no one that is willing to take the risk or when the few people that do want to go get in there are already higher levels farming the loot.<br>
<br>
It's a cycle and what I find funny is that a majority of the people that complain about farming don't realize that they are contributing to the problem by not hunting in those zones themselves. Instead they stay outside and complain about the crappy loot and how prices are always high from farmed items (or low from market saturation). &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
Verant has taken a step in the right direction by making important spells such as evac and rez available earlier. This will hopefully encourage lower levels to try out dungeons at an earlier level. Once they find out what a blast it can be working a dungeon they'll keep populating 'em.<br>
<br>
Remember most higher level players farm because they can. They go into a dungeon that has a good risk/reward ratio and they see no one there so they set camp. Start bringing in experience groups and farmers will just move on, no harm done to anyone. I'm not against farming ... I’m just against constant outdoor &quot;safe&quot; hunting.<br>
<br>
It's not fun and it doesn't teach you much in the way of how to work with a group in a dangerous, cramped situation.<br>
<br>
Just for fun the dungeons I’ve wanted to do but either haven’t been able to or now I’m too high to really enjoy the experience (I need a guild):<br>
<br>
Crypt of Dalnir – Ever since I heard of this place I always wanted to go. It’s just the quests and stories behind this place, they sound VERY interesting.<br>
<br>
Crystal Caverns – I did get to hunt some here but not enough. When I did hunt here with a full group I had a blast every time. I only wish I had been able to find a group here more often.<br>
<br>
Temple of Droga – I’ve always been interested in Goblin dungeons and the fact this one has a city in it sounds great. Great risk/reward ratio doesn’t hurt either.<br>
<br>
The Hole – Yep, this place has always fascinated me ever since I heard the stories behind it (and saw it on my map). Being I’m only 45 there’s still hope for seeing this one at the proper level. Then again I don’t think farming is too bad here anyway given the difficulty. /chuckle<br>
<br>
Tower of the Frozen Shadow – I don’t know if this can be considered a dungeon but it’s fun none the less. Unless it’s a guild group or raid I’ve never seen a pickup group here.<br>
<br>
Najena – Yep, WAY back when I really wanted to do this dungeon. Small, easy dungeon to transition those in the dungeon experience. The spawn here are on a 20-minute timer so breaking spawns is pretty easy. Loot was pretty good for old world standards. Unfortunately closest I came to hunting here was in my 40’s. By then I couldn’t enjoy it much, but from exploring every nook and cranny I KNOW I would have enjoyed doing this dungeon.<br>
<br>
Lower Guk – Okay, okay, so there are camps here but since the expansions they have gotten more and more sparse. It’s really my lack of knowledge that keeps me away from this place. I’ll get the nerve to go some day soon.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule – Friend told me to go there and I never really listened. Now I realized I should have. Now that CT is 50+ zone I still look forward to trying it, just wanted to see how the mid-level version was before they converted it.<br>
<br>
Neriak – So it’s not a dungeon … I still want to do it. Can you believe I have never had a Dark Elf character? In any case I hear it’s a very challenging place to hunt and I do like new things and a challenge.<br>
<br>
Splitpaw – I tried it solo mid 30’s and because of the pathing it was just horrid. I also tried with a small group and again because of the pathing ended up getting too many aggros. Still, in a full group I’d love to do this dungeon.<br>
<br>
Unrest – Again maybe not a dungeon but I still wish I would have done more than just the backyard. This place was great when I was there (teens) and I really would have liked to come back and do some of the more challenging spawns in the house.<br>
<br>
Old Sebilis – I don’t think I’m still at the level to this dungeon but again, one of the places I’m looking forward to.<br>
<br>
Kurn’s Tower – I have an Iksar Shaman on Karana that I still haven’t worked up yet. I think I’ll go with him. Still, another one of the places I never got to hunt at the appropriate level (then again getting there at the appropriate level would have probably killed me).<br>
<br>
Kedge Keep – This place is probably #2 on my list. I mean the mobs and the whole idea of underwater, I want to do it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Permafrost – There’s never a group in there so I could never do much. I was always interested in hunting here.<br>
<br>
Charasis – The lore around Venril and such … very interesting stuff and I’d love to see it/hunt there.<br>
<br>
That’s about it. When it comes to the dungeons that I can’t really do anymore (to high) it’s just that I could never find a group. Being I never really had a guild (well one but that’s it) I couldn’t benefit from constant grouping. I took what I could and tried to find groups or solo spots the rest of the time.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant, just felt like posting something more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Looks like I did indeed have things a bit backward. However it sounds like the main problem, along with a low dungeon population for the appropriate level, is the farming that sounds like it actually keeps xp groups out on some occasions. <br>
<br>
That being said, it seemed that trivial loot code took care of that in the few places that it was implemented, but alas, many people vehemently hated that code. I have seen that since trivial loot code was removed from the Warrens that many higher levels now pop in kill the king or muglwump and then are gone for the next hour until they respawn. That really sucks and I can see how that is the tip of the iceberg compared to other dungeons.<br>
<br>
Should trivial loot code, in some other format, come back?<br>

Its just terminology.. how many times have you been called a pally vs. a paladin.  Same thing.  <br>
<br>
I will say however, that it is extremely difficult to teach someone something when you aren't withing 10 zones of them for more than 0.05 percent of your time.<br>
<br>
I've never heard of anyone hear not taking time to talk with someone or offer advise when politely asked.  Current company included.<br>

Put all the nice loot and items STRICTLY in dungeons.<br>
<br>
That way outdoors are low risk low XP low gain.<br>
<br>
Dungeons are higher risk, High XP, High Gain.<br>
<br>
Your dungeons will start to be a lot more attractive to NEW players.<br>

Twinks will still hit hi spawn rate outdoor zone to level up fast as their gear is all level 40+ anyways hehe. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105286">Gilfalas Elaandrin</a>, Lvl 59 Knight of Tunare & Defender of Nature<br>

<br>
That is something vi doesn't want to do.<br>
<br>
So what alternative could you do then?<br>
<br>
Add a new catagory to items.  Add a lvl to them. <br>
Such as SoG<br>
SoG 41/51 +25 str +10 stam wt. 1.5 class war/pal/sk/ranger lvl 46.  <br>
<br>
This would seriously bother some people but would be a compromise between makeing evrything no-drop and haveing our current chaos.  <br>
<br>
At least people would say &quot;I can either buy that or go get a group and get it for free&quot; <br>
<br>
Another thing verant could do is reduce the coin drop on mobs and lower the value of selling some items. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucaebesilverfish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caebe Silverfish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knight Of the Realm</span><br>  Posts: 768<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/02 7:42:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14941.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to get Noobs into Dungeons....</span><hr size=1> Whatever happens, <br>
<br>
some game wizardry guru has to come up with a way to solve mud flation.<br>
<br>
People who can play 24/7 get the best items first.  No problem there, you get what you put into it.  However, the farming that takes place, saturates (and eventually oversaturates the system) because unlike coin, there is currently no way to 'sink' items.  So, as new zones, and especially new expansions are added, items that were priced in the thousands at one point, suddenly plummet in value, so by the time the 'average' player/ 'average' guild has the capability to pursue those items, odds are, they have amassed enough coin to buy stuff that is being currently farmed (its better, its newer, its shinier, its sharper) so, now in addition to there being no 'sink' for items to limit their existance, you have the added problem that now you have zero demand for these things.<br>
<br>
Eventually it all spirals into the situation where 'the rich get richer, the poor get poorer'.  is that wrong? /shrug, that's how RL works.<br>
<br>
It would be &quot;nice&quot; if each &quot;guild&quot; or &quot;party&quot; or &quot;player&quot; would have the unique opportunity to (a) pursue spawns (b) complete quests (c) amass items/coin/services that can't depreciate in and by themselves.  My understanding is that questing and some(?) zones in DAoC function like this.  Each entry into a &quot;zone&quot; is for the benefit of those who go into it.<br>
<br>
That system would be nice because there would be no such thing as 'depreciation', an item that was valuable/important today, is still valuable/important a year from now.  No more KS'ing fests on Lodizal, Dragons, ToV, Sleepers, Planes. <br>
<br>
Will that ever happen in EQ? doubtful, as Verant sees player interaction in the open markets to be such a valuable and important part of the game.   With the way the mechanics of the game are set up, it probably isn't even possible to establish a 'world' like that now.  Seems like you would have to pretty much wipe everything and spend the next 5 weeks patching.  It would be neat if/when they added a new zone, to at least try something like that.  Perhaps you could add code to account for things like that in one zone and not affect the entire structure of the game.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Personally, i can't stand that part of the game.  If i wanted to be a buyer/seller, i would sit home in my underwear, logged onto my ETrade account all day and trade stocks.<br>
<br>

Certain classes, as far as soloing goes, require some things to be the way they are.  To a certain extent, this includes paladins.  Killing HGs with your dw helm is a lot more realistic with room to back up...<br>
<br>
Vi is on the right track with the changes.  Simply get rid of the tedious and cumbersome aspects of dungeons and you'll see more people in them.  Why is summon corpse a high level spell?  That's the dumbest idea on the planet.  A low level, non-exp rez should have always been there from the start because the fact is, low level and new players are not going to meticulously plan out a dungeon crawl and *will* get in over their heads.  If they get smacked by a four hour hellish corspe run every time this happens, of course they're gonna head to outdoor zones.  <br>
<br>
Then there are other logistical issues to be considered.  You just died but got a call from work and have to log off of EQ immediately.  Your corspe is under nagafen's big toe.  This actually happened to me and coordinating with the one high level necro in our guild was difficult.  I finally had to buy a coffin and just sit at the entrance to sol b until a necro or sk wandered in.  For two days I was playing in ghetto gear while I sat there and waited.<br>
<br>
For all intensive purposes, a corpse run or retrieval in a dungeon should be only slightly more difficult than in outdoor zones.  The key distinction between an outdoor zone and a dungeon should be in the difficulty and strategy required, not in how long it takes to get your stuff back.  I would avocate going a step further and suggesting that vi should sell potions for 100p that do summon corpse.  <br>
<br>
The point of the game is to have fun, and you can argue for days that if you die in a dungeon well tough, there's a price to pay.  So what.  Right or wrong, I'm not having fun if I'm sitting around waiting and doing nothing.  Vi is finally starting to realize this.<br>

If you're a class than can't cast invisibity, aka paladins, then it just isn't practical to just swing by there on a whim to see who's there, and there are never any lowbies hunting in lesser fay to form a pickup group there. <br>

Dungeons really need to follow a natural progression of the zones outside of them to be truly popular.
