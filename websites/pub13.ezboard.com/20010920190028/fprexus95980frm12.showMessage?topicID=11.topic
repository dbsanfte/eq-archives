Scabbard<br>
========<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kargek Redblade'<br>
Kargek Redblade looks up from his forge and says, 'Hello there, can I help you?' Your eyes are drawn to an extremely large red sword scabbard strapped to his back with no sword in it. Kargek speaks again, 'I said, can I help you or do you need help from Wenden?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what is that large red scabbard'<br>
Kargek Redblade turns to look at you and says, 'It is a family heirloom.  I might tell you the story behind it if you do me a little favor.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'what favor'<br>
Kargek Redblade says 'An associate of mine is wandering somewhere in the Feerrott. His name is Oknoggin Stonesmacker. If you will deliver this note to him, I would appreciate it. <br>
<br>
I found Oknoggin stonesmacker beside the bridge in feerot on the side closer to ogguk.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Oknoggin Stonesmacker'<br>
Oknoggin Stonesmacker says 'Yoo leave me 'lone! <br>
Oknoggin Stonesmacker snatches the note from your hand and rips it open with his large hands. 'You take dis to Kargek. He want!' Oknoggin says, as he throws a tiny lute at you. <br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
I then returned the lute to kargek.<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Kargek Redblade'<br>
Kargek Redblade looks up from his forge and says, 'Hello there, can I help you?' Your eyes are drawn to an extremely large red sword scabbard strapped to his back with no sword in it. Kargek speaks again, 'I said, can I help you or do you need help from Wenden?' <br>
<br>
You say, 'who is wenden'<br>
Kargek Redblade points to the other side of the forge and says, 'Wenden is my partner. He is standing right over there. If it is a question about a weapon, he will probably have the answers.' <br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Wenden Blackhammer'<br>
Wenden Blackhammer says 'What do you need? Be specific, I'm busy right now! <br>
Kargek Redblade says 'Thank you for delivering the note to my associate. Take this book - it will tell you a little of the history of the old scabbard. If you would like to own the scabbard, seek out my younger brother Tenal and give him the book. <br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
The book he gives you tells about how the redblade family was entrusted with the scabbard by Rallos Zek and it is their job to test any warrior who feels worthy of it.<br>
<br>
I found Tenal Redblade in east karana, he is in the gorge part of the ramp leading to highhold. He is the very very back of the gorge.<br>
<br>
Tenal Redblade says 'So, you know my brother Kargek. He is weak and does not believe the legend that our family was chosen by Rallos Zek to bear the great scabbard. Yet he still holds it. Very well, I shall give you the first test since my 'dear' brother seems to have forgotten it. Travel to the fortress where the children of Rallos were first cursed by the Rathe and bring me the heart of one of the goblins who have made it their new home. Do not return without the heart of your foe and this war totem.<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
I turned in the Goblin Ice Heart and Totem of Freezing War and got this <br>
message:<br>
Very good, you have wreaked havoc on your foes in the ancient land of the giants. Rallos Zek must have guided your blade.&quot; Tenal's voice is suddenly silenced and you feel as if your body is frozen. From Tenal's lips issues <br>
a voice that is not his own, 'Bring this mortal the scales of the children of Veeshan. The red and green as well as my war totem. I will guide your blade.' Your movement returns as Tenal falls to the ground, gasping for breath.<br>
<br>
He also gives you a Totem which must be the one turned in with the red &amp; green scales for the next part.<br>
<br>
Anyways I turned in the scales after that. The scale from Severilous in Emerald Jungle (Green Dragon Scales), the scale from Nagafen (Red Dragon Scales), and the fiery war totem he had given me before. I got exp and an item back. It was not the scabbard. It was &quot;Mark of the Sword&quot; to be returned with another item. The item, while not easy to get, is not tricky at all. It is easier to get than the scales since it is not used for anything else, but still a 4+ group effort. I'll put up the exact item after the weekend. <br>
<br>
Hilts<br>
=====<br>
As far as the hilt goes. You can get a &quot;Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt&quot; under the Aviak tower in Lake Rathe. The ogre shaman with a pet near the Rathe Mts zone tells you about seeing some glowing thing down there when he took his yearly bath.<br>
<br>
Ok, more information. I found the hilt needed for the second sword in Timourous Deep. It's a small bag on the ground on the chessboard island. It looks like the other one but is called a &quot;Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt&quot;.<br>
<br>
Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt<br>
==========================<br>
LOC: Aviak tower in Lake Rathe<br>
Need: Diamond, Jacinth and Black Sapphire <br>
<br>
You say, 'what about the hilt?'<br>
Wenden Blackhammer says 'What is it you need to be knowing about hilts? Do you need one made or repaired? <br>
You say, 'I need a hilt repaired'<br>
Wenden Blackhammer says 'Well, tell me the name of the hilt you need repaired and I'll see what I can do. <br>
You say, 'it is a Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt'<br>
Wenden Blackhammer says 'That just looks like its missing some gems. I'm not quite sure what type of gems either but I can tell you two things about them just by the settings. They were all different, and they all were very, very expensive. If I try to put the wrong kind of gems in <br>
these slots, it may be ruined forever. I'll do whatever you want, though, just bring me the three gems you want me to try and put in the hilt. <br>
<br>
<br>
Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt&quot;<br>
==================================<br>
LOC: Timourous Deep. chessboard island(-6500,+3000 ). <br>
Need: Ball of Everliving Golem(Plane of Fear) and Rejesiam Ore. <br>
<br>
For the Rejesiam Ore, he sends you to talk to Mentrax Mountainbone, a named giant, who is in the very back of the giant mine in the giant fortress FM. Mentrax refuses to say much when you tell him that wenden sent you except that he wants a new monocle and doesn't want to talk until you bring him one. Giant monacles drop off mountain giant patriarchs<br>
<br>
Asking Wenden Blackhammer about this, he responds with &quot;Where in the world did you drag that up?!&quot; Denken peers closely at the severely damaged dragon head hilt. &quot;This metal is the same material that some mages use <br>
to make powerful golems and this other metal looks like rejesiam ore. If you can find some of those materials, I can fix up this hilt easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blades<br>
======<br>
<br>
Sword Covered With Runes<br>
========================<br>
LOC: OOT(Denken Strongpick)Avaik Island <br>
NEED: a keg of Vox tail ale, a block of permafrost and 2 new rebreathers<br>
<br>
You have entered Ocean of Tears.<br>
Denken Strongpick judges you amiably -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br>
You say, 'hail Denken Strongpick'<br>
Denken Strongpick says 'Hello, Bten . I am Denken Strongpick. I wish I could get off this rock, silly clan honor. My boss broke our rebreathers and we can not go back to the mainland before we gather some goblin relics.<br>
You say, 'what relics?'<br>
Denken Strongpick says 'There are supposedly goblin ruins around here somewhere. Fendlemend thinks we will find paydirt underwater. We did find one thing. <br>
<br>
You say, 'what did find?'<br>
Denken Strongpick says 'We found a very fine sword blade.' Denken pulls open his pack and shows you a razor sharp sword covered with runes. 'I can't figure out what type of metal it is and I sure can't figure out what technique was used to forge it. Perhaps you would like to take it off my hands and [buy] it?<br>
 <br>
You say, 'i will buy it'<br>
Denken Strongpick says 'Out here, money is fairly useless to me. You see, I can't leave Fendlemend out here alone. I signed on with a very detailed contract. I could sure [use] a few things from the mainland though. <br>
You say, 'what can you use?'<br>
Denken Strongpick says 'I would be willing to part with this very fine blade for; a keg of Vox tail ale, a block of permafrost to keep it cool and two new rebreathers to get this operation back underway. <br>

Most of it just compiling other peoples post, adding conversations with the NPC’s and my personal thoughts and questions about this Warrior Quest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Scabbard - Kargek Redblade in East Freeport, he's on a ledge over the area leading to the Shadowknight guild.  Hail him.  You ask him “What about your Scabbard” and he asks you to do him a favor in return for information about it.  You tell him that “I will do you a favor” and he gives you a Wax Sealed Note to give to Oknoggin Stonesmacker in Feerott.  He's an unfriendly ogre near the big span the bridge there in Feerott.  I had to use wolf form so I was not KOS with him. You give Oknoggin the note and he gives you a Tiny Lute to return to Kargek Redblade.  You give Kargek Redblade the Lute and he gives you a book (I forget what it’s called.) that will tell you a little of the history of the old scabbard.  He tells you if you would like to own the scabbard, seek out my younger brother Tenal Redblade and give him the book.  Tenal is located in East Karana at the very bottom and back must part of the ramp leading to HighHold Keep.  You give him the book and you will get a (something like) Totem of Freezing War (in your inventory, so make sure you have a primary slot open).  With this totem he ask you to bring him a heart from one of the goblins that have made their home in the land of the giants and return the Totem and Goblin heart to him.  The heart that he’s looking for comes from Goblin Wizards in Permafrost.  It’s the Heart of Ice that you’re looking for.  You give Heart of Frost and the Totem of Freezing War to Tenal Redblade.  You get a “Totem of Fiery War” in your inventory and Tenal becomes possessed by Ralloz Zek and you get told to bring this mortal the Totem of Fiery War , Red dragon scale and Green dragon scales from the children of Veeshan  (Lord Nagafen/Talendor (skyfire dragon) for Redscale and Severilous (emerald jungle dragon) for the Greenscale).   You give the Totem of Fiery War, Green Dragon Scale and the Red Dragon Scale to Tenal Redblade.  From there this quest is supposed to go on…<br>
<br>
<br>
First Hilt - In Lake RatheTear, right below 3 spawn (the aviak stairs/platform thing strait out from the South Karana zone).  There is water.  If you look under the water in that first little pool of water and at the very deepest part of the cone shape floor you will see a tiny bag.  When you pick it up you will have something called “Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt”.  You bring this back to the guy next to Kargek Redblade in East Freeport named Wenden. Talk to him and say “Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt”.  He will tell you that the hilt is missing 3 types of very expensive jewels and he’s not sure what type they are.  If you talk to Fellonious Sworddancer in East Karana right close to the bottom of the ramp to Highhold Keep, he will tell you a long winded story about an Ogre Champion Suteng that used to own these blades that we are all questing for.  But the intrusting thing is that he talks about this Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt.  He confirms that the 3 jewels needed are indeed the Diamond, Black Sapphire and Jacinth.  You give Wenden the Unjeweled Dragon Head Hilt , 1 Diamond, 1 Black Sapphire, 1 Jacinth.  He will make the hilt for you and it’s called a “Jeweled Dragon Head Hilt”<br>
<br>
<br>
Second Hilt - In Tremorous Deep at the chessboard.  There is a large King chess piece.  Right at its base you will see a small bag.  Pick it up and you will get a “Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt”. You bring this back to the guy next to Kargek Redblade in East Freeport named Wenden.  Talk to him and say “Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt”.  He will tell you that with some Rejesiam Ore and Golem Metal he can repair it easily.  Wenden says this about the Rejesiam. “Rejesiam ore is from the lands of Kunark.  The mountain giants in the frontier mountains control the only known mine of this great ore.  They have built a vast fortress around the mine to protect it.  The giants don't particularly like to trade with us smaller folks, but there is one old miner named Mentrax Mountainbone who has traded with me in the past.  Go find him and tell him Wenden sent you.”  --- Mentrax is in the very back of the mine inside the giant fort and he’s willing to trade with you, but he wants a Monocle that will fit him.  These are known to drop of Giant Patriarchs in the Dreadlands.  The are called “Giant  Sized Monocle”.  It seems to be some kind of eyeglasses for one of your eyes.  Wenden say this about the Golem Metal. “That metal is used as the 'soul' of powerful magical constructions like golems.  I do not know any place in this world where you could find a golem with a living center as powerful as this once was.”  ---  Apparently the Golems in the Plain of Fear drop this.  I’ve heard it’s called a “Ball of Everliving Golem”.  I have confirmed that Dread and Fright both dropped it, but Terror was unconfirmed.  You give Wenden the Severely Damaged Dragon Head Hilt, Rejesiam Ore and Golem Metal and he will repair the hilt for you and it’s called a “Finely Crafted Dragon Head Hilt” <br>
<br>
<br>
First Blade - There are two new NPCs on aviak isle in the Ocean of Tears. Fendlemend Figlefop, a gnome, mentions a &quot;silly sword blade&quot; he found while excavating for goblin artifacts. He mentions giving the blade to his dwarven excavator Denken. Upon asking Denken Strongpick about the sword, he shows you a &quot;razor sharp sword covered in runes&quot; and asks if you want to buy it. Saying he has no need for money, he offers to trade the sword for &quot;a Keg of Vox Tail Ale, a Block of Permafrost to keep it cool, and two new Rebreathers&quot;.  The Keg of Vox Tail Ale is supposed to be sold in Halas at a bar called McDonald Fire Cider.  The NPC’s name that sells it is Brandyn McDonald and it sells for about 125pp.  But do to a bug right now.  It is only being sold on the Test Server.  Expect a fix soon.  The Block of Permafrost is a rare drop off of Ice Giants inside of Permafrost.  The Rebreathers are made by gnomes useing their tinkering skill and cost about 1000pp.  I don’t know if this quest goes on after you give Denekn his keg, block and rebreathers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Second Blade - I haven’t seen anything about this.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are some other questions that I don’t have an answer to either and I’m hoping you guys can help<br>
<br>
***Where does the Second Blade quest start?<br>
<br>
***Once you have the 2 hilts and 2 blades, what blade and what hilt goes together?<br>
<br>
***How do you combine the Hilts and Blades to get your weapons?   I think that Wenden combines them, but I’m just guessing.<br>

Here is the deal with me and making rebreathers.<br>
<br>
You supply the money to make these suckers.  I do not charge for the time or the skill of tinkering.  I consider tinkering skill increases to be payment in full for my time and skill.<br>
<br>
SOO... You could get lucky and have 2 rebreathers for the quest at slightly over 2kpp, or it could cost a fair amount more.  That is the chance you take working with me on these. You'll have to eat the cost of failures on the goofy a$$ trade skill   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Here is my current stats for 2 rebreathers.<br>
<br>
1st warrior I made 2 for I started at a skill of 107.  Got 2 made for about 5 kpp.  Skill up to 112<br>
<br>
2nd warrior I made 2 for about 6 kpp.  Skill went up to 116<br>
<br>
3rd warrior I made 2 for about 8 kpp.  Skill went up to 121<br>
<br>
FYI the aqualung is a tinkered component that is required to make the rebreather.  The aqualung is a trivial component at a skill of 148.  Rebreathers do not have a known trivial rate.<br>
<br>
If I am not busy when I get the tell from someone for making rebreathers I am more than happy to get together and attempt em for you.<br>
<br>
Only thing I like to get b4 starting it in earnest is a charisma and insight buff from a high level enchanter (49+ is best).  Having the 49 cha buff can save like 53 pp per attempt at rebreathers<br>

Go to East Karanas<br>
At bottom of Ramp (to highpass) there is a elven NPC<br>
named Felonius Sworddancer.<br>
Hail him, and ask him about the Ogre.<br>
Listen to his story and pay close attention.<br>
<br>
2)<br>
Go to East Freeport<br>
Go to the Slums (where all the tents are) You will find two NPCs standing on a cliff, by a fire beside a building.<br>
Hail Kargek Redblade.<br>
Ask him about the Scabbard.<br>
Tell him you will do him a favor.<br>
He will give you a note to carry to Feerot, to an Ogre named Oknoggin Stonesmacker.<br>
<br>
3)<br>
Go to Feerott.<br>
I suggest you have plenty of invisibility potions or a high level escort (who can kill Ogre Bashers).<br>
Along the river there is a stone bridge. The NPC is beside the bridge (but so is a basher so be careful).<br>
Hail Oknoggin Stonesmacker<br>
Give him the note and he will give you a small lute.<br>
<br>
4)<br>
Go back to East Freeport.<br>
Give the Lute to Kargek Redblade.<br>
He will give you a book on the history of the Scabbard.<br>
<br>
Read the book.<br>
<br>
5)<br>
Go to East Karanas.<br>
At the base of the Ramp is where Broon spawns, so be careful. <br>
Follow the &quot;canyon&quot; that is along the ramp, to the very end. There is an NPC there.<br>
Hail Tenal Redblade.<br>
Hand him the book.<br>
He will give you a Ice Totem and asks you to get the Heart of an Ice Goblin and return both items to him.<br>
