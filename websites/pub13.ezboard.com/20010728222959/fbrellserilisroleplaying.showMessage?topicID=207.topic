The thick seed swollen tops of the grass stalks tickled her fingers as she walked waist deep in this sea of vegitation, her arms held out just at the top of thier level. <br>
She was enjoying pleasant conversation with the winds, listening to its many stories that it carried with it. The grass was noisy with its constant hissing of chatter, yet it was all soothing to her.<br>
To her left, friends were dancing and hiding amongst the tall reeds, to her right more friends were wading through just the same as she. She was here with her friends. <br>
<br>
A feeling of happiness and inner peaces came over her, for she knew that she was with those who cared about her, those who enjoyed her company as much as she enjoyed thiers.<br>
<br>
Her feet crunched down suddenly on the broken and loose stones of a wasteland of war. Here the flames have burnt away everything she loved. Her friends faded out one by one, turning into transparent ghosts before disappearing with the winds that now brought cold pain. <br>
The once peaceful fields were now smoldering around her, not a living soul around her, except the annoying gnats and flies that accompanied the dead corpses of horses. <br>
<br>
One salty tear ran down her cheek, and wet the corner of her lips. All of this was so sudden, it came out of nowhere, and before she knew it she was right in the middle of a major battle. There was nothing she could do to restore the beauty she once knew.<br>
<br>
She immediatly set foot to travel back home, where it was warm, and safe. There, more friends awaited her.<br>
<br>
At her home town, she saw the people she knew, she cared for. They were there just as she left them. The cold winds were still driving sharp needles of pain into her exposed skin, but just a little further..<br>
<br>
Everyone stopped to look at her. A small puddle on the ground revealed her reflection. She was no longer the beauty she used to be. She was covered in the dark, burnt soils of the fields, and smelt like the feces of the dead horses she saw earlier. Her eyes were weary and sunken, bloodshot to the iris. Her hair was mangled and burnt, the heat from the flames have stripped the beauty of her once long, golden hair. She was uttery disgusting and horrid.<br>
As she approached the village, people saw her and hurried inside thier homes, shops closed, and the animals called out in anguish of seeing her. Then the cold, bitter winds picked up again.<br>
<br>
The animals' animations began to fade once again into transparent copies, then faded. The people around her were gone. She was no longer around anyone alive. The houses were now worn, and creaked on rotting wooden supports. Broken signs banged relentlessly until they were torn free by the wind. The putrid smell of dead horse carcasses burnt her nostrils, and she collapsed in a muddy puddle.<br>
<br>
There, she wept. Her tears of pain and sorrow ran down her face and into her mouth, choking her. She cried for days, ignoring the hunger and thirst her body so badly needed. Only the faint sound of a voice brought her out of sorrow. She looked up, and saw an open door down the street. <br>
<br>
Quickly she ran, as fast as her sore legs would allow. Inside she found a ghostly image of one of her dearest friends, who had since passed away in the fields. The image made her sorrow swell up in her throaght till she could not breath anymore. All the image spoke was &quot;remember..&quot;<br>
<br>
And then she embraced the image, pretending to hold it in her arms, trying to remember all she had, before the flames of hate destroyed everything. She was alone, but she had her memories.<br>
<br>
And only her memories. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=208.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showMessage?topicID=206.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=207.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=207.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>Tome: History of Norrath</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
