I know Dae's posts seem as though he will do that.  I didn't before, but I've gone back and read them a bit closer.<br>
<br>
I believe that Dae is a sweet and caring individual.  If he doesn't understand that a 14-25 relationship is wrong right now, I truly hope he will in the future.<br>
<br>
The fact is, he has not committed any crimes.  So don't judge him on what hasn't occurred.  Don't say you hate him for what you THINK he'll do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/urunildentinuviel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Runilden Tinuviel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/29/00 1:53:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nothing says &quot;Come arrest me!&quot; like a death th</span><hr size=1> Rof, I ninja-edited my post after reading yours.

I doubt anything you people could say is worse than being so caught up in your dislike for me that you’re willing to rationalize Dae’s behavior and ninja edit the statements where he makes no bones about having me killed. You guys want to know why you don’t see anything that looks like a serious threat? It’s because Naroon changed one post and apparently someone else deleted one thread all together to protect him from the consequences of his own actions. Here's one of the the originals:<br>
<br>
<CENTER><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/snoozeybear/killme.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/snoozeybear/killmea.jpg"></A></CENTER><br>
<br>
Which was quickly changed to <A HREF="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthemeadow78989general.showMessage?topicID=1167.topic&index=23">this</A>.<br>
<br>
Not that it would matter to any of you in the least. You lunatics have passed the point of sanity to where you think it would be okay for me to be murdered simply for pointing out things that some of you are just now admitting to seeing. This has never been about Dae being gay, or when he would "legally" be a pedophile. It looks like he’s been one for a while, and from everything I’ve read that he’s written, he doesn’t see anything wrong with it. Is an 18 year old dating a 14 year old evil? A little flaky, but not too bad. A 25 year old with a 14 year old is definitely wrong, and if you can honestly show me two words where he has expressed <EM>any</EM> interest in changing his lifestyle, I'll shut up about it for good. I suspect the only reason he isn't a 25 year old in a sexual relationship with a 14 year old is that he isn't 25 yet. Don't judge him on what he hasn't done yet? Why not? Right now he's no different than a drunk behind the wheel of a car who's about to drive because he's decided he can handle it and he's got no other way home. He's expressed no desire to change his tastes and you nuts have given him no reason to. In fact, you're all re-enforcing that it's fine by pretending the stuff he's saying doesn't exist. Being a pedophile isn't necessarily about age limits, it's about power, desire, and attitude. A 16 year old who is sexually attracted to 11 year olds is still a pedophile, just not "legally" yet. The legal age limits are just a defining line to take out any of the potential mix-ups or questions.<br>
<br>
Either way, I'm gone. It's all fun and games until a posse of lunatics decides that it's fine to murder someone because he was <EM>mean to you on a message board</EM>. Yeah I called in the threat to the same Agent I reported his board to. Do I think he's actually going to try and have me killed? Probably not, but there's no harm in me creating a nice paper trail just in case. DO I think that the FBI will come bust down his door? I doubt that too, but I imagine they take a pretty grim view on him saying he's going to have the guy who reported him killed, especially if said person actually wound up dead. Congratulations you all, you've finally driven me away by rationalizing my murder at your hands as being acceptable in the name of being nice. I won't be back here or the Meadow, and I'll consider any attempt by any of you to contact me, or interact in my life in any way a hostile and threatening act and respond accordingly. <br>
<br>
The truly sad thing in all of this is the type of behavior you've degenerated to defending, but instead I'm sure you'll all take quite a bit of pride in it. Enjoy your life of ignoring and rationalizing criminal behavior so that your polls on who's the horniest girl at the Meadow and why society is crumbling can go on in peace, though I'm sure the irony of you wondering that is probably lost on you..<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. And by the way, the beer thing was a gag. It would have been "priceless" in the same way that watching a bear holding a pot of coffee while riding a unicycle would have been priceless. Bound to be a disaster but interesting none the less. I guess you guys are short on sarcasm and irony out west. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/uarchbob.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arch Bob</A> at: 9/29/00 5:12:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/urazoreyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razor Eyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/29/00 7:14:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nothing says &quot;Come arrest me!&quot; like a death th</span><hr size=1> May I have your e-mail, UIN, or something similar, Bob?

I <i>do</i> want you to stop terrorizing Dae... but I don't condone killing. When I said earlier that I don't blame Dae for feeling the saying what he did - I meant that to say, I can understand why he would <i>feel</i> aggression towards you.<br>
<br>
Humans have emotions. They lead us to do things that we probably <i>shouldn't</i> have done - and say things like that. Yes, it was inappropriate, but at the same time, wouldn't you feel some type of aggression against someone who's been tormenting you for the past several months?<br>
<br>
Besides, there's also this little thing called puberty. It happens to all of us, hence, you should have at least a little reference on what I'm talking about. You see.. teenagers regularly do things that many people would consider "immoral." Whether or not you jump on them for being sick perverts without giving them the chance to "grow out of it" in a few years is, imo, the line between being acceptant of other human mistakes/errors in judgement/plain old human traits, and being completely intolerant of those things. You claim Dae has no intention of changing. What makes you think he's so unlike the entire rest of the population that manages to grow out of puberty eventually? What gives you, <a href="http://pub2.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=20627.topic">a clear supporter of hentai/porn</a>, the right to judge other people's morals, when what <i>you</i> do could be considered wrong and immoral by many? (including me).<br>

I imagine that it that protective side of me.  However, I deleted nothing.  The board admin can attest to that fact.<br>
<br>
However, I am glad that you decided to leave us raving, non-judging, blind, lunatics alone.  You know, when I was 18 years old I was hell bent to leather to move to California and try acting.  I had been taking ballerina lessons for quite sometime and I loved to dance.  I was 100% confident that being an actress was what I wanted in life.  If someone told me otherwise I would have said the same thing that Dea has said in regards to liking younger males.  But, I received a partial scholarship and, begrudgingly, went to college with an undecided major.  After a while in the, I decided that I acting was not want I wanted in life.  Pursued the business college and graduated with a respectable title of Cum Laude.  But 6 years earlier, I would have laughed in your face if you would have told me that I would be sitting for the CPA examine and passing it after 3 attempts.  I probably would have been on my knees and holding my stomach as I laughed as hard.<br>
<br>
The point?  Dea is still young.  Things that are being said today will not necessarily hold true for tomorrow.  To assume that they will hold true would probably create a world full of firemen, policemen, baseball players, ballerinas and actresses.  Not very many people end up doing what they decided they wanted to do when they were a teenager.<br>
<br>
OK... anyway.  The only reason I posted here is because you (AB) brought up my name.  Whether it was in sarcasm, genuine worry about my son's safety, or because I have more vowels than consonants in my name, it does not matter.  Whatever I say will be taken under advisement.  So I request that you refrain from making references to me or my son.  And I will never feel the desire to post anything about you again.<br>

My initial opinion was one of respect for you. You had a way with words and could argue your points well. Then, it slowly turned to disgust, as you used that power towards negative purposes, like fuelling your blind, uncanny need for pissing people off. Then, it turned into amusement. Because, after a while, what you did just got old. The shock wore off, and I thought it was really funny. Because it was. <br>
<br>
Now, it's nothing more than pity. =P Someone who claims themselves to be a healthy 32 year old with a productive social life, yet still has time to unrelentingly piss people off on a message board, and then try and get people arrested in real life just strikes me as <B>piti</b>ful. And, that's what you are. A simple creature who fights like a tiger and then when backed into a corner, he cuts off everything and strats calling the feds IRL. =P Well, Bob, there's nothing I can feel but pity anymore... And happiness, that I don't know you, live near you, or worst of all, be someone in YOUR position. *shrugs*<br>

I'd put it behind me and moved on.  I never give a thought to Bob and his crusade because I don't have the emotional energy to waste on a loser.  However, it seems in my absense that you've carried on and recruited a whole little army of fawning acolytes, all praying to the alter that is Bob.  Now allow me a couple of statements, and you mindless followers can make up your own minds.<br>
<br>
For the record (not that I see it makes any difference) I'll be 18 in a month and a half.  The fact that Bob thinks otherwise and that he'll take this as proof, per his earlier statements, that I've somehow lied about my age and/or birthdate just goes to show that he hasn't been paying attention.  Which is surprising as he's apparently collecting every little tidbit of info he can on me.  Was quite impressed by the way he's extrapolated my approximate location by piecing together the little clues he's gathered in his furious search for justice.<br>
<br>
My boyfriend is 15.  He's a freshman this year.  I would be a senior if I was still in school.  But of course it's completely unheard of for a senior to date a freshman.  For those who are wondering, no, I have no intention of breaking up with him when I turn 18.  We're in love and it doesn't work like that.  Both our parents are aware of the relationship and are quite happy for us both.<br>
<br>
Yes, I've admitted an attraction for younger guys.  So what?  I keep hearing about what a bastard I am because the boys I prey on are too young yadda yadda yadda.  What boys?  I preyed?  When did that happen?  Come on people, think for yourselves.  Bob speculates that I may do something in the future and you all have it written down in stone that it's already occured or is occuring.<br>
<br>
I've got a friend who is attracted by those muscly types.  You know, the big greased up bodybuilders?  He's never dated one.  Has no plans to.  Says he likes the look, but the mentality that comes with it, i.e. slaving over your own body, focusing your attention on building your muscles rather than your brain (for all you smart book reading bodybuilders out there, this isn't meant as an insult) just doesn't attract him.<br>
<br>
I know other guys who's idea of bodily perfection is limited solely to supermodels.  Do you think they date them?<br>
<br>
What I'm saying, is that right now I find younger guys attractive.  They aren't the only people I find attractive, and given the situation I wouldn't attempt to date one.  I've said that I didn't see that attraction going away, but what do I know?  I used to be scared of clowns too.  I've always been small for my age and a very late bloomer.  My mom and my shrink seem to think that's where my attraction stems from.  I've stated that I didn't think so.  But again, what do I know?<br>
<br>
I'll tell you what I do know.  I know the law.  I also know kids.  Why would I do something that I thought would cause a kid pain or get myself in trouble?  I know how difficult it is to grow up confused and outcast.  Do you think I would wish that on somebody else?<br>
<br>
Well, apparently you do.  Apparently the simple statement that I find younger guys attractive means that I'm some sort of monster without a conscience or a soul.  That I'm afflicted by these uncontrolable urges and that I'll stop at nothing to see them fulfilled.  MWAHAHA!  And why is that?  Oh yeah, because Bob said so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub2.ezboard.com/ushinshin2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shinshin2</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.execpc.com/~msippel/thedruidsgrove/images/threadimage.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/29/00 8:28:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.dharma-haven.org/dharma-wheel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ack.,</span><hr size=1> OH MY GOD!

Across the board. Frankly, I welcome him to. It just seems like he's giving meaning to his otherwise pitiful existance. <br>

Well, relatively.

Bob, you've taken things out of hand. Everyone's lost interest. You don't know Dae, I don't know Dae. You don't know me either. Maybe I'm a sicko who likes to lick gerbils whilst attaching my nipples to the mains electricity supply, and I didn't tell you so you'd think I was normal? Who knows. Just leave Dae alone. Ok, so he said he wanted you dead. I really don't see him coming round your house with a gun, and chainsaw and a big bucket of petrol, do you? When people are driven to extreme emotions like Dae was by your good self, Bob, they say stupid things they don't mean. But then, there's always some ass who has to go running to mommy because they took it seriously. Jeesh!<br>
