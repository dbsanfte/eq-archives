<br>
Warcraft 2<br>
StarCraft<br>
Diablo<br>
Diablo 2<br>
(just to name a couple)&quot;<br>
<br>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br>
<br>
Uh ... none of those was a massively multiplayer game.  If it was EASY to do, everyone would do it, and there would be a lot MORE of them :)  From first-hand experience, you can code a 8-16 player game fairly rapidly (and in some cases sloppily), and still have a fairly stable system.  It's all about MTBF:<br>
<br>
Mean Time Between Failures<br>
<br>
Let's say you're a programmer (or engineer, as some of us like to be called :) and you're working on your &quot;piece&quot; of code that you've been assigned.  You have an elusive bug which crashes the game, but you simply cannot replicate it.  This happens *all* the time, folks.  So, assume our bug is a 1 in 100 error ... the programmer would likely have to hit that section of code 100 times with 100 different conditions to cause it to error again.  Most programmers will do one of several things at this point:<br>
<br>
1) Assume the bug was caused by a power surge and sweep it under the rug (bad boy!).<br>
<br>
2) &quot;Use the Force&quot; and make their best guess as to what the problem actually was.<br>
<br>
3) Add in more debug and wait for it to fail again (this is what Beta helps with, actually).<br>
<br>
Now, we're in Beta (in Beta, dammit, not production) and we get 1000 testers online.  The testers bombard that section of code, with 1000 different sets of data, in the same time it took the programmer to do it once.  The problem rears its ugly head in short order, and the programmer can then (hopefully) nail it down fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
Ok, now we've gone gold (production release) with a 1 in 100 or even 1 in 1000 bug still there.  How long does it take the game to crash with 35,000 folks hammering on it?  Not long.  That Mean Time Between Failures has just been divided by the number of folks using the software (a simplistic model, but it gets the point across).  What should crash &quot;once in a blue moon&quot; now errors out every 5-7 minutes.  The users who bought the game are pissed off at the hideous instability.<br>
<br>
So, they immediately patch problem #1 in the release version ... and use the user base as beta testers again ... and the programmer who solved problem #1 has just made a new problem (side effect), which is another 1 in 1000 problem.  Repeat, repeat for weeks, keep repeating until stable.<br>
<br>
This is why VI breaks EQ so often.  It is incredibly hard to test the sheer amount of content in one of these massively multiplayer games.  Sorry, Diablo II just doesn't compare.  They're not even in the same ballpark.  <br>
<br>
That being said, the choice of TCP over UDP is something that's been hammered out *many* times in the past, with many different prediction models, etc. being used.  There's a neat magazine &quot;Game Developer&quot; that you folks can get back issues of if you so desire ... the content is usually fantastic.  The mag is also free for those of us in the game development community.  Personally, and this is from having written SMALL multiplayer games (1-32 players), I would have gone with UDP from day 1.  TCP has processor overhead, larger packet headers, and less flexibility than UDP.  You can always write into your network layer a method by which you can guarantee delivery of (some) UDP packets (those that you need to insure that the game state is valid) while letting less important (read: movement) packets fall out if need be.  You can't do it the other way around ... if you go with TCP, you are stuck with TCP, and all packets are then required (by the networking layer) to be delivered, and assembled in the proper order.  I've written games with both TCP and UDP layers, and UDP provides the maximum flexibility.<br>
<br>
As for the firewall argument: Some firewalls may not allow UDP packets through.  I'll admit I'm not a firewall (either software or hardware) guru.  However, UDP does have a sender and recipient, just like TCP.  The same five things that define a TCP stream define a UDP stream (sender, port, recipient, port, and protocol).  Most firewalls that I've encountered have Multicast packets turned off by default ... but UDP works just fine.  Like I said, the only ones I'm familiar with are my company's, and my personal (software) firewall at home, so feel free to correct me.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: AO didn't test enough.  Their stress test going poorly should have caused them to delay their launch.  It's better to have a good launch that's delayed than to lose 50% of your user base due to bad experiences / bad feelings.  I tried to install on the first day ... 6 hours wasted trying to get the patching program to work.  Yes, I'm stubborn.  Next day, they had a fix out for the patching.  The day after that, I spent 2 hours stuck in a building (couldn't zone out) ... and they patched that the day after.  IF they can make it work reasonably with TCP (which requires that the total throughput not exceed the buffer space of the pipe, by the way ... which is a totally different discussion), I predict they can nail down MOST of their playability problems within the next 2-3 weeks.  I wouldn't expect a fully-hardened MMORPG before at least a month.  They are NOT STARTING THE 30 DAYS FREE TIME until the product works acceptably well ... so if you're REALLY pissed at the performance, go play EQ for a while and come back.  <br>
