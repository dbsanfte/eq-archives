The Watchers have apparently decided that checking the board isn't necessary for a mob they can kill with one group, even when another guild (i.e. Art of War) stated their intentions to raid 3 days prior.<br>
<br>
We understand that intentions to raid are intentions, and not reservations.  But the attitude that Vaillen of The Watchers responded with when we called them on their actions solidified the fact that if any guild wants to disregard the server community, they can and will.  Basic response when we said we planned on killing him that night - &quot;phin's not reservable, we didn't read the boards, he's dead deal with it&quot;<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Friends of Brell, prepare to have a more difficult time getting your epics while this sort of behavior continues.  Are intentions on Kunark bosses next to be ignored?<br>
<br>
Many apologies to Galayan, Galadhrill, and Vaellen who we invited to join us on the raid and had to have it ruined by another guild's greed and selfishness.<br>

I can declare my intent to do an E-Boots raid.  If someone's there before me, I'm out of luck.  It doesn't mean they're heartless bastards for going there before me.  They didn't deliberately go there before me &amp; take the Efreeti.<br>

Darkguard has signed up 2 Severilous raids as an intention.  When we do this, we realize that someone MAY go there before us &amp; kill the dragon, if he's up.  We realize that he MAY despawn on us.  Still, it's our way of getting the people we need together to kill him.  It's an intention system.

Now if he was an ass about the way he spoke with you thats one thing but intentions are intentions.  No one has to honor them or check the board.   You seem to think that because you posted an intention that no one is allowed to go and kill him first... sorry thats a reservation not an intention.<br>

So if we see anything under raid intentions posted and wanted to kill it first, we could plan our raid before hand and take it out?  We were under the impression people generally took a look at the board before taking on anything with a large enough spawn time (&gt; 4 hours), and if someone posted they were going to go after it, then the raiders should pass.<br>
<br>
If this is not the case, then we apologize and take back everything in the initial posting.  If everything besides planes and dragons are first come first served, then so be it.  Good to know.<br>

Though it sounds like people would go out of their way to _not_ check the boards for mobs they'd like to camp, and if there's no repercussions from jumping people's raid, what's to stop them?  <br>
<br>
Art of War has (until now) treated raid intentions as reservations, apparently without knowing this was untrue.  It's good to get this matter cleared up, thanks for everyone's comments.<br>

No it was not you personally from Art of War that did the exact same thing to BI that you are claiming Watchers did to you, but none the less, it was Art of War.<br>
<br>
Same scenario, we posted several days in advance for a FG raid, then 3 days later Art of War posts they intend to step on our FG Raid with a Naggy raid.  Never bothering to contact anyone in BI, and the raid leader completed refused to do any in game negotiations.<br>
<br>
The threads were deleted on this message board, cause thats what they do with them... but you can see in the very last post of that thread my discontent with Art of War.<br>

This is not one of those... Oh! BI did all this planning and forgot to look on the board and notice a Naggy raid, now they are yelling wolf!...Too bad soo sad for them!<br>
<br>
Quite contrary, we posted 3 days before AoW our intent. AoW never contacted us and had someone not stopped on our board and notified me, it would have even been worse... Then to top things off, your Naggy raid leader (a monk) REFUSED to talk to me in game after repeated /tells from me. And I don't mean 2-3 /tells, that he may have overlooked cause he was getting spammed minutes prior to the raid... I mean I was online 6 HOURS! before the raid, sending him tells.<br>
<br>
I guess better to ask forgiveness than permission, right? Thats the attitude I was given. <br>
<br>
Who cares, its old news... just nice to see people get theirs every now and then... guess Brell does have a sense of humor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Whether or not Naggy does take precedence on a FG raid doesn't give someone the right to step on someone. I guess Art of War would know that now though, wouldn't they?  <p>Qualtar Shylok --

Anything less than a reservation means absolutely nothing except to advertise for people. People can do that on their individual guild sites. having forums for them simply leads to a sense of entitlement that isnt justified in this case.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

You seem to be of the mind two wrongs make a right, however.  And considering what people have been saying in this thread, perhaps we were not in the wrong after all.<br>
<br>
I've already taken back what I've said, no bitterness with the Watchers at all.  We didn't know intentions != reservations, now we do.  Easy fix.<br>
<br>
And as far as &quot;stepping on people&quot; is concerned.  It appears that that's the way all non planes/dragon mobs are done.  <br>
<br>
So here's the Brell Serilis lesson for today:<br>
<br>
If your raid intention gets stepped on, you keep quiet, and try again another day.  If you step on someone, no big deal.  If they complain about all the time and effort they put into their raid, tell them tough shit, and go on with your day.<br>

Once again whatever your point is it's not obvious to me Qualtar.  Fire Giants, Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate, Plane of Sky, Nagafen, Vox, Venril Stahir, and Trakanon are reservable.  They are reservable by anyone that can follow a few simple rules.  I don't see where your ranting about uber comes into play.  Please enlighten me.<br>

This raid was not done with much planning we went there it was open and done we did not check the boards for a possible conflict. I do not believe this deserves a rant however for the simple reason that a posted intent is not a reservation as the rules stand. We ,as have others, lose raid areas / mobs all the time. I would be upset if it was a reservable mob but not a situation as is this where intent to raid is the only reservation.No mal intent was meant nor should it be percieved as such. <p><i><b><font color ="red">Giov Arcanum</b>
