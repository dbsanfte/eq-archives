<br>
The fires of Solusek Ro raged throughout the wooded vales, destroying ash, beech and cedar in fits of a great whirling maelstrom. Flames leapt from treetop to treetop like faeries dancing upon the crystalline tips of Underfoot’s spires. For weeks, months or years, the fires raged, until at last the fury of Ro was spent, and the flames retreated to the sanctuary known as Lavastorm, land of perpetual flame.<br>
<br>
Once the fires were quelled, a shadow moved throughout the glens and valleys left smoldering in its wake. The shadow moved across the dry riverbed, and approached a gap in the iron mountains that separated the smoking vales from the great fields beyond. Slowly, as if searching, the shadow moved across a small mound of smoking earth, then it stopped and hovered near the cusp of the hillock. There, beneath the shadow, was a small bowl of granite that held fast a pool of molten stones, still hissing and boiling from the intensity of Solusek Ro’s touch.<br>
<br>
With a speed born of intense purpose, the shadow gathered itself about the pool of silvery-black liquid. A mercurial steam arose from the pool, pulled within the shadow itself. There, in the sheltering darkness, the liquid congealed and was molded into the form of a chalice fit for the hand of one of the smaller races of mortals. While the cup was still steaming, yet formed, the shadow stretched its will beyond the vales to the seaside hills of the deserts, and withdrew several fragments of alabaster. With a craftsman’s finesse, the finishing touches were imbedded as the alabaster fragments coated the outside of the chalice in a pale, deathly whiteness. The inner cup and stem of the cup remained the color of cold iron with a silvery sheen. Finally crafted, the shadow breathed upon the chalice, imbuing its essence into the cup and touching its elements with a malice born from the wellspring of hate.<br>
<br>
A great gasp of horror issued from the mortal that had followed the shadow, and witnessed the creation of the artifact of Innoruuk. Devrann T’Grazz, a scribe within the palaces of Neriak, the Underfoot city of Innoruuk’s children, fell upon his face before the swirling black mist that surrounded the dazzling chalice. With a terror unlike anything he could have imagined, a voice shouted within his mind, each word a searing, tortured swordthrust of hate.<br>
<br>
“Behold, Chosen! You have witnessed the beginning of my Compact with you and your kind. You have witnessed the creation of the Bloodstone Chalice. Now witness its meaning for your future!”<br>
<br>
With a blinding suddenness, Innoruuk’s shadowy form stretched out throughout the vales, entering every smoking shell of a tree, permeating every cinder, every stump. With a mighty shout of Hate, his voice and spirit gave rise to a new wood, a shaded forest cloaked in his aura of darkness. With the speed of thought, the forest sprang into being upon the broken husks of the light-filled woods that had stood before. With a sudden rage born from his hatred of his peers, Innoruuk spat and the steaming river vaulted to life once more, promising life to the woods until the end of time.<br>
<br>
Devrann T’Grazz had stood without knowing it, and his mind exploded with the knowledge that his Prince had completed an immense miracle before his very eyes. The forest he stood within no longer hurt his eyes to see, but rather was beautiful in every way. Clearly could he see the ripples of shadow and hate that had imbued every tree and shrub with life after the cleansing death granted by Solusek Ro.<br>
<br>
“Such as I have done here, I shall do across the face of Norrath. This is my promise to you, my Chosen, my children.” The voice was now a whisper, but its hate, if anything, was even more intense. Devrann attempted to fall upon his face before his god, but he was frozen, totally unable to command his body.<br>
<br>
“I will complete the transformation of this world only when you prove to me that you are ready, and only after you have prepared the world for the change. I called upon Ro to cleanse this valley, but I call only upon the Chosen to prepare the remainder of the world!”<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Devrann’s arm was raised, and a great gash appeared upon it. He watched in horror as his blood flowed into the bloodstone chalice. When the chalice was full, wicked scars covered the wounds, leaving marks in body and spirit that would never fade. Then, the shadows condensed above the chalice, and a single black drop fell into the cup, merging with the blood and turning it to a dark, violet hue. Again, Innoruuk breathed upon the chalice and the blood, united with the material manifestation of Hate, was pulled into the bloodstone of the chalice and sealed there through the power of pure Hate.<br>
<br>
“Remember the Compact. In a harvest of violence, you shall prepare this world as I have prepared this valley. When you have finished this work and proven your hate to be pure, the world will be transformed as you see it now, and shall be given over to your hands to rule. Only the worthy shall rule in the world I make, the others will be blown asunder or reduced to beasts of service. You must prepare the Chosen for this work, but do not begin until I send my messenger to you. Remember the Compact and grow in Hate.”<br>
<br>
The shadow rose into a column of darkness, and passed through Devrann T’Grazz, and all thought fell from him like the dropping of a stone from a cliff. When he awoke, the forest about him was seething with life, but remained cloaked in the shadows whose birth he had witnessed. In his hand he held the Bloodstone Chalice, the physical evidence of the Compact of Hate. In his heart lay the Hatred of his Prince, and in his mind lay the knowledge that he would be Innoruuk’s High Priest upon his return to Neriak.<br>
<br>
Holding the Chalice to the sky, Devran T’Grazz swore upon the future of his race that he would prepare his people for their great works, and to wait for the word of the Messenger. With his first step from the small hillock, he realized he had taken the first step toward fulfillment of that vow. Intent upon gathering others to the cause, others who would share in the work of preparing for the work of harvesting and the privilege of paradise, he returned to Neriak and changed the course of the future of his people, the Chosen of Innoruuk, the Teir’Dal.<br>
