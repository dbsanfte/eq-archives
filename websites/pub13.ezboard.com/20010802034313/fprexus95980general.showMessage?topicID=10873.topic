The thoughts of a casual player.</span><hr size=1> I am, now, a very casual player.  I am not on to raid as much as alot of members of my guild.  I have a full time job and a full social life, and a message board addiction I'm trying to kick!<br>
<br>
My question to you readers and people is this, friends and strangers alike:<br>
<br>
Why do you think that deserving an epic has to do with me sitting in front of my computer until I lapse into a catatonic state?<br>
<br>
Merit?  I don't know, that word we have agreed is very misleading sometimes.<br>
<br>
I'm a cleric, through and through.  I switched classes to cleric from magician because I truly enjoy helping others.  From simple things, like ressing a corpse next to me or buffing a newbie who asks, to getting a COH down to Disco in sebilis to res a group or helping out a younger raiding guild.<br>
<br>
*I* want my epic so that *I* am more useful and helpful.  I want to be able to zone into Fear and res 20 corpses in 5 minutes.  I want to be able to res that corpse at the seb ramp without having to ask my group to wait a minute.  Yes, it has nice stats.  Would I still want it just as much if it were an item without stats that could be used from the inventory?  Probably!<br>
<br>
But back to my question; *WHY* in the WORLD do you think me deserving my epic has to do with whether or not I've spent the last 72 hours awake in SolB?<br>
<br>
Food for thought, and oh.  /auction wtt Donals bp and legs for epic, assuming guild won't burn me alive!<br>

The thoughts of a casual player.</span><hr size=1> Lists are ok, but they require some one to moderate them and that is extra work.<br>
<br>
The trouble here is there are alot of clerics ready for Zordak.  How do you start this list up?  <br>
<br>
What about a random amonst all the clerics?  Well so how do we get them all together at the same time, find out who to invite because they are ready, then do it fairly so no one redoes a random when no one is looking?<br>
<br>
Even if we can get past that step, we need to moderate it.  Remove the first person on the list, inform the next that they are up.  What now happens is that Joe cleric kills Zordak, he spaces for a day informing the list.  Suzy cleric is next, they send her an email or what not and she is out for a day or 2 and Zordak spawns before she gets the news.  Zordak sits there for a while waiting while another cleric wants him.<br>
<br>
Or people start to wait, he pops at 1am, they kill him 18 hours later because this Zordak is THEIRS.  In that time another Zordak may have spawned or the delay may prevent a second or third from spawning before a patch or Nagafen spawning.<br>
<br>
I want nothing to do with the ugly fights, people taking the Zordak while others are away mess.  It will get ugly fast, uglier than the posts on him have been here lately. <p><br>

There is nothing to discuss on the other side, you need to do the work.  If you don't want to sit there and hold the spot for him, that is your choice.  I don't think if you walked in, found him up and no one there you are less deserving.  But if you don't sit there like everyone else you won't get it. <p><br>

The thoughts of a casual player.</span><hr size=1> If anyone were to come up with a system that was truly fair by favoring those who put the most time in for their epic first and others later, and at the same time make clerics lives easier, I would be all for it.  I have yet to hear of such a system and no cleric has come forward with an answer.  All I hear is a lot of bitchin from clerics who want to feel a little more special and a little more useful than other clerics, yet aren't willing or able to put the time in to get the epic that grants them that.<br>
<br>
At first I felt sorry for clerics.  Then they kept complaining while offering no real solutions.  So I tried to councel them a little bit.  Then more complaining, less real solution offering.  Then I let them deal with their own affairs.  Now I'm at the point where I'm losing a little bit of my faith in humanity as so many different clerics time and time again say there should be a list only to repeatedly, and indefinately fail, abysmally, again and again and again, to offer a solution that doesn't screw everyone over who IS willing to put in the hours versus people who AREN'T willing.<br>
<br>
If this was such a major problem then I would imagine that someone would have taken the time to establish a working system to eliminate this problem.  Right?  Guess it's not as serious a problem as people think it is then.  Because you'd think with all the clerics at the zordak point, at least ONE would have come up with a working idea right?  Nope.  Guess not... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utheskyfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Skyfyre</A> at: 8/1/01 4:21:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DDDDAA><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uididartzan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ididar Tzan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/01 6:30:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who deserves Ragefire?  The thoughts of a casual player.</span><hr size=1> To answer your question, you silly dorf ....<br>
<br>
Its because that's how the game is designed. You get the stuff if you put in the time. As a player we all start this game out with nothing but the grey matter between our ears (except ebay types) and we work our way up from that. What we get is because we have friends who got something for us or because we plunked our asses down or ran around the gameworld to get something. But, ultimately, it never comes free. Either you put in the time playing and making friends who give you stuff or you put in the time camping it yourself. You paid some price for it and it didn't involve JUST killing the mob when your name was called.<br>
<br>
Basically, you paid your dues.<br>
<br>
You did what everyone before you did and you did what everyone who comes after you should do, put in the time if you want the item.<br>
<br>
Afterall, if this game was more about having an itchy trigger finger or having good hand-eye coordination we wouldn't be here saying that Verant should tweak the game for those who don't have good hand-eye coordination, would we? But, because their game involves TIME some of us insist they should either change the spawn times or we, as players, should setup lists to allow more people access to an item. Well, imo, that defeats the purpose of the game. Helping friends camp something is one thing ... because that person has put in the time making friends who're willing to make that sacrifice. But, setting up a nice little comfortable list isn't about making friends, its about making it relatively easy on the casual player who would normally never see their epic. They'd normally never see it because of time just like the player with the bad hand-eye coordination would never see his epic in a game more geared towards that. In the case of the other game we couldn't do anything to help them but, at the same time, I seriously doubt we'd be caring that much because most people seem more willing to accept a limitation such as superior hand-eye coordination moreso than they're willing to accept a limitation of time. <p><a href=http://www.3deearts.com/sos/profile.asp?who=Fdor><img src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor-Sig.jpg></href></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#AADDDD><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usergex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sergex </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/1/01 8:06:57 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~haujobb/images/BMage01L.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Who deserves Ragefire?

We are indoctrinated from the time we want to get Bronze Armor that in order to get what you want you must sit and wait for it to drop.  If you want to change the way the game is played only for Ragefire, it's not going to happen.  <br>
<br>
Why do I have to go on 50 POH raids to get a full set of armor? Why do I need to kill a million frogs to get a SBC or RBG?  Why do I have to kill 2500 cursed hands to get Donal Gaunts?  The question of why do I have to sit on my ass for 72 hours to get Ragefire has the same answer.  <br>

As I've stated in other threads, it simply isn't fair for people that want something, but not enough to be willing to put in the effort required to get it, to have an equal chance at someone that will/can put the effort in.<br>
<br>
It's fairly simple.  Getting item X requires action Y.  If you're not willing to do action Y, you don't deserve item X, because you, personally, have decided that item X is not worth the effort(to you) it would require on your part.<br>

Epics are for our 24/7/365 players out there. Epics are not for everyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Being the second newest cleric on Prexus (Gratz to Adalyyn for getting hers last nite!) to recieve my rez stick, I can say, lists are crap. I wont even start there. It truly does take away from the &quot;epic encounter&quot; and turn it into a &quot;every cleric deserves&quot; which is BS.<br>
<br>
Verant put this bottle neck here just like there is one in every epic quest. VSR for rangers and druids, Vox and Naggy for palidans, Big green dragon for warriors, all dragons for bards...see what im getting at here? Imagine being a palidan and not wanting to level past 52 just so you can continue to go on Vox/Naggy raids with hopes of getting the books.<br>
<br>
Does every cleric who is of sufficient level and have his/her pearl deserve Zordak? No. Does every player in the game deserve his/her epic? No. Would I like to see every player with his/her epic/rez stick? Definately yes. BUT, I cant stand to see a list. The way I see it, if you want your epic, no matter of class, you need to do the time. If you dont have the patience to sit there and wait for a spawn, be that behind one or two other people, how can you say you truly want your epic?<br>
<br>
The list. The list that was being created in SolB was total crap. That was one of the reasons I did my epic when I did. I happened to be off for 4 days, and Im not one to follow a list when the person isnt sitting there camping. So I got in line, and I have mine now. A list out here...how could it possibly be made fair? If you try to tell me that it is more fair for a level 52 cleric who cant even cast the frigging spell from his/her spell book to be in line in front of a level 60 who has done his/her time in EQ, thats a bunch of shiat. How would you make it fair to those that are sitting there already? I dont know why a cleric would even want a list. It is such a sence of accomplishment by being there, waiting, clearing the FG's, waiting some more, and finally, having a ranger/druid out of no where say &quot;Hes up!&quot;. After waiting for 96 hours for my spawn, my heart was racing when I heard this. It stayed that way for a good 6 hours after I already had my epic in hand. Wow Im rambling, lemme end this.<br>
<br>
1. Should every cleric get their epic? Probably not.<br>
<br>
2. Should there be a list? Definately not.<br>
<br>
3. Should every cleric that wants it get in line in SolB camping it right along with every other cleric there? Definately yes.<br>

And that is: Verant has no clue about fun game pacing. <br>
<br>
Most games are designed to reward the player as often as possible, EQ is the total opposite, making people believe that putting &quot;time in&quot; is the way to go, and the fact they accept to mindnumbingly do it encourages Verant to continue adding these idiotic camps.<br>
<br>
There is nothing LESS epic than sitting on your ass... Oh wait, maybe foraging for 23 hours is less epic, at least for Ragefire you get to stand up and smack a few FGs around from time to time -- tough call.<br>
<br>
The problem with this game is that it is played by people who have a life and play 4 hours from time to time, by people who don't and play 24/7, and by everyone in between. To prevent making the game trivial for those who play 24/7, Verant has to introduce a time element to every quest in the game that while acceptable for the 24/7 crowd makes it impossible for the other players. <br>
<br>
I would move to a server that limits my play time to 15 hours per week and makes all camps last half the time in a flash, they just don't offer that option <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You do what it takes to get the epic, and weigh your actions against your future interactions and views of the game as a result. <br>

<br>
If the epics were designed more like the Shawl or Ring quests it would be different too. Maybe they could have done it so you get the actual weapon after the first big fight with a quarter of the stats and without the effect, and upgrade it with more stats at every step, adding the actual effect on the final hand in. It would be the same item in the end, but the reward feeling would be constant. <br>
<br>
They even attempted this with say the druid epic (i.e. you get the Elaborate Scimitar with (much) lesser stats as a mid quest thingy) but did it in such a way that people who get there actually usually complete their epic in the next 30 minutes. <br>
