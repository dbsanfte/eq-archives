<br>
Of course, as a true troll, he's not, and is reading with relish every single sentence we respond to. And breathing heavier each time he reloads the page and sees his message still near the top. <sigh><br>
<br>
So why encourage him by replying?<br>
<br>
Well, it's simple to see we're hardly even reacting to him, but more to each other. More /bounce's and /hug's than I've seen on many messages. =) That's the neat thing about this board, is so few folks take troll-bait. Instead it turns into a thread building more community. THIS is what a message board should be! <br>
<br>
So Atari, or Commodore or whatever yer name is, when you see a message entitled "|-|o\/\/ 2 GIT P|-|4+ Lo0+" you may read it and be edified in the manner in which you're expecting. If you see popsicles you can opt out. <br>
<br>
Or if you see a thread you started still on the first page, you can congratulate yourself on what a clever and influential fellow you are, and how we all care very passionately about the articulate issues you raise. <br>

Not once did I talk about my guild, myself in the game, or anyone else in the game for that matter.  Some guy who I guess knew who I was ingame had to let everyone know what guild I was in and what server I was from, when that had nothing to do with my argument.  I talked about this board and how unrelated to EQ it is, and how with every post and it's declining into a &quot;how can I be a little more crazy today?&quot; type of board.<br>
<br>
Please go back and read how your original arguments turned into a big attack on myself and my guild :)  It's quite funny...... now go on and say how I'm a KEWLD00D or however you put it.<br>
<br>
I guess it was my choice of words that got everyone riled up.  But now you've twisted everything I've said and attacked me as many of you say you don't.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its that holier than thou mentality that ruins the game! God-Like uber guilds should be broken up and not<br>
allowed to play together! they ruin the experience for us all!&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, when did I ever bring up anything of that nature?  Give it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, why do you feel those must be exclusive of one another? If I'm looking for info on druid matter, I'll go to a thread that says something like, 'Grouping tactics'. If I want to be a little silly I'll go to a thread that reads 'Please stop posting never-ending threads because they make me want to shoot myself'. How is it that you fail to differintiate between the two?&quot;<br>
<br>
But even when reading a good topic, people reply with their 10000 line signature, their signature images that don't load, and then they'll be like &quot;give me a popsicle&quot; or some BS like that.  Obviously if a topic is titled &quot;COME LICK MY POPSICLE&quot; or something of that nature I'm not gonna read it.  However, every normal post is saturated with all the BS that is turning this board into a playground.<br>
<br>

Dude you are just too funny :)  Like man, we are really mature on this board.<br>

<br>
I replied to this earlier.....<br>
<br>
&quot;Ataros isn't posting anymore. He must be out somewhere being elite and getting fat loot! (My lingo is a bit<br>
 rusty...)&quot;<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I don't sit here refreshing this message board every minute of the day and read every single post.  Sorry I can't reply fast enough for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've realized that there are too many of you out there who like your huge signatures and everything else that doesn't need to be here, so it ain't gonna change.  I guess I was hoping it might.<br>
<br>
But before you reply again, please don't feed me BS about my guild or that I'm a kewld00d or whatever.  It has nothing to do with this.  However, if you do, chances are it'll be cluttered with emotes and spam and whatnot so I guess it really doesn't matter.<br>

Two whole responses about your guild and suddenly <i>everyone</i> has..."turned my whole point which had nothing to do with EQ........ to me being from an uberguild that only cares about loot" and how this post has "turned into a big attack on myself and my guild"<br>
<br>
Where is this big attack?  2 replys. out of 60?  Poor man, how can you deal with being beset on all sides like that?  geez.  seems to me that about 50 of the responses so far have been us talking to eac other and handing out more sweets and hugs.<br>
<br>
As far as Wirewolf's response goes.... what?  Can't recognize sarcasm?<br>
<br>
And about the sigs (of which mine is pretty large I think) what is a couple of extra inches of space?  I'm sorry if you're one of those obsessive/complusive types who feels he needs to read each and every line of each and every post and sig.  You could have simply alerted us to your medical condition and we could have accomodated you.  See.... the rest of us just skip right on by em.<br>
<br>
'Man!  I hate whenever I'm responding to a post and there are those checkboxes with the Posting Options.  It's so unfair that I have to stare at those each time I write a post.'  And what about those ad banners?  Man that is just wasted colorful space.  why should I have to be subjected to that?<br>
<br>

The most crucial thing for you to remember is, if you are no longer happy with this board, the neverending threads, the long signature files, the 600k pics, the /emotes, etc, etc, maybe you should move on.  I'm pretty sure the title for this board is &quot;the Druid's Grove&quot; not &quot;The EQ world accordding to Atoros&quot;...If this place is no longer the place you once approved of, do what so many other people do...evolve with the change and move on with your life...find another board that fits your standards, but be prepared to move on when it's not what you like anymore.  Nice thing about the internet...NOBODY FORCES YOU TO COME HERE AND CHECK THIS MESSAGE BOARD!!!!<br>
<br>
/em realizes she could have used the cap locks key on that last sentence rite after it was finished...she must be a gimp =p<br>
<br>
I only wish I had a long sig file for you too, unfortunately I don't, so you'll just have to be disappointed at not being disappointed with me...<br>

This board is dedicated to discussing EverQuest in a fun free atmosphere. Anyone who does anything remotely interesting will have their IP address banned. Thank you, I hope you all enjoy! <p>You no longer have a target.
<BR>You begin your casting.
