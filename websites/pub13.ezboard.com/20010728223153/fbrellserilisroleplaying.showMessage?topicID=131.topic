She had met many wonderful people in the last few days, but one face stuck in her mind.  She played with his name, creating rhymes;  potential lyrics for a world of possibilities which suddenly seemed to open up for her.  He had claimed her as his own.  She was certain it was in jest, they had just met.  Still, she wondered if this was what it felt like to be in love.<br>
<br>
Her reverie was abruptly halted as she stared at Cyris' packs, filled with provisions.  Her face fell as a sense of doom swept over her.  She approached the table tentatively, a young kitten tapping to see if the mouse is dead, ready to jump back startled at the first sign of movement.  She peaked in the packs.  His armor, his weapons, his prayer book.  Then her heart stopped.  She opened a pouch to reveal over 100 peridot.  Cyris was going to battle.  <br>
<br>
Cerres sank heavily into the chair, her spirit tied to a boulder thrown into the Ocean of Tears and rapidly sinking.  Closing her eyes she reached telepathicly. She felt the hunger of the she-wolf.  She reached further still, for the presence she had always known since the day of her birth; safety, protection, and profound love. She found void,  darkness,  emptiness.<br>
<br>
Cyris knelt beside her chair and buried his head in her lap.  Cerres had never seen him weep.   She stroked his hair and let the tears cascade down her cheeks.   They sat, brother and sister, beacons of light that had pulled their father from despair after the death of their mother.  Two halves, reflections of each other, opposites combined to make a whole.  No words passed between them.  <br>
<br>
Finally, Cyris choked back his tears and looked up into his sister's face.  &quot;I must go find him.  I must bring him back.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;I will go with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Cyris was emphatic and yet his voice was filled with compassion.  &quot;I must go alone.  I have arranged with Master Songweaver for you to continue your education.  He will take you back into the Academy and you may stay with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres marveled.  This was her dream, her greatest desire.   Master Songweaver only took the greatest of the great singers into his home to apprentice with him personally.  She would be among the greatest coluratura's in Norrath.  But at what cost?  Certainly not one she could bear.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather be a galley drudge and have Daddy back.&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know.  And that is what will make you great.&quot;  Cyris beamed with pride at his sister.  His father's eyes stared back at him, green as the trees of Kelethin.  &quot;I must go.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cyris stood and began arranging his pack.  Cerres helped him, sneaking her rations into one of his side pouches.  &quot;Bring him back,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if all that is left is a single ash, I will find it.&quot;  Cyris said with deep conviction.  &quot;And if it takes every ounce of my strength to resurrect him, I will give him life as he gave me mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recognizing his tone, Cerres felt oddly comforted.  Cyris had never failed at what he set out do.  &quot;You won't fail now,&quot; she told him.  She hugged him good-bye.  He kissed her on the forehead.  And after he left, she got a candle and, as she had seen her mother do endless times when Daddy went to fight the dragons, she lit it and placed it in the window to guide his way home.<br>
<br>
Cerres stared for a moment out the window.  Her father's last words came back to her.  &quot;You are such an innocent.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Cerres smiled a mirthless smile. &quot;Was, Daddy, was.&quot;  <br>
<br>
After packing up the kitchen, putting all the dried goods in rodent proof boxes and giving the perishable items to the birds and the bear and wolf cubs, Cerres turned her attention to her parent's room.  The bed was still unmade and father's unused armor and weapons carelessly tossed about.  Cerres picked up his old helm and hung it on the hook.  It had been his very first item acquired in the plane of Fear and she smiled remembering him wearing it into the house, strutting like a peacock.  Mother had replaced it, her last gift to him, with a brown one she had found in Old Sebilis.  Father loved it.  It's magical properties allowed him to run like the wolves.<br>
<br>
Cerres folded up his hangman's noose, it's magical properties atuned to its owner, useless to anyone else.  Cerres caressed it remembering Daddy's promise to take her to Trakanon's Teeth and find her own hangman.  Cerres sighed.  That would not happen now.  <br>
<br>
Finished admiring and crying over Daddy's armor, Cerres began stripping the bed, tossing the old grass from the mattress.  As she stood holding the empty bag to her chest, she noticed an etching on Daddy's nightstand.  Daddy and Mother in Sky the day he had proposed.  Daddy kept it on the nightstand even after mother left.  So he did still want her back.  Cerres clutched the etching to her chest and decided to take it with her.  Maybe someday they would all be together again.  And as quickly as the hope flashed in her heart it burned out again.  Perhaps it was enough to just remember.  <br>
<br>
Cerres chose not to freshen the grass and folded the mattress bag.  As she placed it on the bed she noticed a slightly charred book lying under the plaatform on her mother's side.  She pulled it out and dusted off the jacket.  &quot;101 Ways to Please a Ranger&quot;.  Mother used to read the book in bed at night when Daddy was away.  Cerres smiled remembering the different ideas mother would concoct to keep him home through the next campaign or dragon raid.  She remembered the night Mother had thrown the book in the fire and Daddy retrieved it.  That wasn't one of the ways the book had suggested for keeping him home, but apparently it had worked.  They kept the door locked and didn't come out for four days.<br>
<br>
Cerres took the book.  Perhaps it could be useful.  She sang the Blessing of the Marriage Bed as she left the room.  It was a strange choice, but it somehow seemed to fit.  She said good-bye to her mother and father, and closed the door.  <br>
<br>
Cerres moved to the room she and Cyris had shared.  She started with the top bunk.  They must have argued over that bunk for 10 years before Cerres finally relented and stopped trying to steal it from him.  Sleeping on the top bunk was, perhaps, the only thing Cyris had ever been beligerent about in their entire lives.  As Cerres dumped the grass, she noticed a thick stain on the underside of the mattress bag and chuckled.  She could still see Cyris' face when he realized he'd just crawled into a  honey covered bed filled with ants.  She still thought it funny and well worth the price.  Daddy didn't paddle her often, but she had certainly received her punishment that night.  <br>
<br>
Unlike Daddy, Cyris had left his things neatly arranged.  Nothing remained for Cerres to pick up or put away.  And yet, she had to touch his things, to smell him and memorize his essence so she would never forget.  Cerres opened the closet and saw his boots lined up.  She picked up his old dwarven workboots and held them to her chest.  Daddy had replaced them with golden Efreeti boots as a reward for his hard work in school.  He was already five grades ahead of Cerres which was an irritant in itself, but those boots were a slap in her face.  Daddy had given her nothing.  <br>
<br>
She hated those boots and she hated Cyris for earning them.  She taunted him for years about it, calling him &quot;Goody golden boots&quot; to his face, in front of his friends.   She sat, smelling his boots, memorizing them and him in them and marvelled that she had felt so much hatred for one she loved so dearly, one who was in every way a part of herself.   Each time she tormented him, she could feel his annoyance.  And yet, never once did he ask her to stop.  Never once did he complain.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's hard being the sister of a saint,&quot; Cerres told herself as she put the boots down and closed the closet door.  <br>
<br>
Packing her things didn't take long.  Her instruments and music she carried with her everywhere.  She had only an extra lambent breastplate and helm and her old Crystallin sword.  The etching.  Mother's book.   She spied Cyris' old &quot;History of Religion&quot;.  It was worn and dogeared.  Many nights he would read to her fascinating old rites or stories of martyrs and saints.  That book had inspired Cyris in his calling and the look on his face as he studied the ancient prayers reminded her of how she felt singing Sello and Brusco and Kelin.  The stories were his inspiration.  She wondered that he had left it behind. Cerres placed the book in her pack.  <br>
<br>
Taking a final look around the room of her youth, Cerres sang Kelin's Lullaby.  Taking her pack, she tiptoed quietly from the room leaving the memories peacefully sleeping, and silently closed the door.  <br>
<br>
Standing at the door, Cerres looked at the empty house.  But it wasn't emptiness she saw.  The house was filled with family and friends, laughter, tears, struggle, and moments, ever so brief, of peace and contentment.  <br>
<br>
As Cerres headed down the path, she began composing what would become one of  the greatest operas of her day.  Centuries later, Ranger of the Empire is still performed.  It's lyrics part of our common vernacular.     <p>Cerres Swiftfyre <BR>
