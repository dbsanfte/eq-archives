I NOW propose instead of the uber guilds running the show let each registered guild have ONE representative and each well known Indy vote on the intent board abolishment and keep that representnative to vote on all future changes. This forum seems most unfair to the smaller guilds and some of the Indys. These reps can also be used to diplomatically represent the guilds and or indy players on these boards as far as all other current board policies go.<br>

I vote that the uberguilds REALLY take over the server for a 2 month period.  Then we can go back to scheduling on the planes, and rotations on ubermobs, and see what people prefer.<br>
<br>
Then we can all decide for ourselves whether the uberguilds were controlling the system for their own benefiet, or helping everyone else out. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufino70.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fino70</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/14/01 9:04:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Whole new proposal !!</span><hr size=1> Would be a classic example of &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutly&quot;..

<br>
Seriously though, the board is geared to the small guilds.  Since every Indy has the same right as every small guild as every large guild, 100 people in 2 large guilds get 2 raid slots, where 100 people in 6 smaller guilds get 6 slots.  1 Indy is free to sign up to lead a raid as well.<br>
<br>
The situation is hardly dominant in favor of the large guilds.<br>
<br>
Of the mods, I am a L55 Monk in a guild of 11.  Jester's a L51? now druid in Abyss.  Zesty is a L60? Druid in SR.  Binge was a cleric at one point, not sure what he plays now.  He's in Norrathian Social Club, hardly an uber guild, although they are ultra l337.  Vumil is a 60 Necro in SR, but doesn't play EQ very much at all.  Delsonora is a low 50's mage, also in Norrathian Social Club I think.  I'm not certain on NSC's numbers, but I think they only have 6 or so people over 50.<br>
<br>
There's as much of a case to be made for the Norrathian Social Club controlling the boards as there is for SR.<br>
<br>

LOL, instead of using catchy cliches, why not just call him an asshole to his face?<br>
<br>
&quot;My point was the boards not the server are IMO UBEr run (but I could be wrong I have been wrong before)..&quot;<br>
<br>
Just where is the board &quot;uber&quot; run. I want you cite specific examples. Administration? Moderation? You make the case for small guilds but have you checked the number of peeps in Darkguard? What is it...11? I'll humor you though, maybe your argument is really Power Gamers vs. Non-Power Gamers. That more close to what you're getting at?<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no beef with any Uber guild you guys rock and without you guys most of brell would never have had the strategies it has and we thank you..&quot;<br>
<br>
Obviously you do have a beef or you wouldn't take pot shots at them for how they are &quot;uber-running&quot; the boards. If you think there's a conspiracy, you think you're getting run, you think you can make a difference, then stand the hell up and put your personal time in and moderate.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I just dont think the smaller guilds stand a chance on this board against your membership base.. I will keep working on this Idea until all the small guilds tell me to forget it..&quot;<br>
<br>
Small guilds or non-power gaming guilds? What guild are you with anyway? If you think you deserve a shot at everything then coordinate with your guild and see if they're on the same page as you. It could be that's why they're a small guild, they don't wanna get caught up in the hubbub of it all. <br>
<br>
However, if they think they can take on the world then go for it. Sign up for raids, get to know people, communicate, build a network of friends who are willing to work with you to help you towards your goals. <br>

Like Adun said:  He's in a guild of 11, and others aren't in the &quot;uber&quot; guilds.   Some of the more vocal people that help shape the rules on this board AREN'T in &quot;uber&quot; guilds.   I'm the leader of a guild of 10 yet my proposed rules are the ones currently used on the Vox/Nag/Trak/VS boards.   Adun, Saphdia, Kruunch, and many many others NOT in SR, LoH, Elysian, Enshadowed, Watchers, SD have put alot of input into these boards.<br>
<br>
The rules we have now greatly favor those in small guilds or independents and not the large strong guilds.  My last Hate raid I took members of Drunks of Tunare, Invaders of Norrath, and Circle of Illumination along with my own guild.   If we wanted to we could easily each reserve a date and I could lead them all.  How does that favor the &quot;uber&quot; guilds?  None of our guilds could hold a plane raid ourselves without others yet by the rules we could each take a date giving us 30 people 4 dates to Enshadowed's 30 people's 1 date (example guild, not pointing fingers).   I don't agree with doing that but it does happen.  We could have 8 raids every 2 weeks by signing up seperate but I chose to take us all as one.   Darkguard and Merryband did this same thing.<br>
<br>
Please drop the &quot;uber&quot; guild crap.  I was a guide on a server with a TRUE UBER guild and trust me... you do NOT know what an uber guild is if you've only played on Brell.  With a true uber guild you would get to kill ONLY what they didn't want to kill.   I wish I could have been a guide on Brell.<br>

That line was in half-jest, the LOL was meant to put the sentence out of context. I assumed it would and came across as an ass to you. I should've used a <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  or a less offensive word but context is killer after all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
&quot;Now as far as examples.. I really haven't dedicated enough times to cite more examples than one.. and to be honest it's the only one that matters to me.. THE intention boards vote.

THIS is my whole point.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm in what you could consider a &quot;small guild&quot;. We've never hosted a plane raid, only a few members have planar gear, and there's a variance in level. Trust me, I KNOW where you're coming from.<br>
<br>
However, I am disagreeing with you about the board. I've met most of the mods in game. They are normal peeps IMO, no better and no worse than myself. I think part of the problem (and I've seen it referenced a few times) is that people &quot;look up&quot; to peeps who's guild tags contain the words &quot;Redemption&quot;, &quot;Watchers&quot;, &quot;Enshadowed&quot;, etc.<br>
<br>
What you need to do is look ACROSS and not UP at them. It doesn't bug me that someone has accomplished more than me in game. I get tells all the time at my full TV armor. That tells me I accomplished more than someone else but I wouldn't want that person to look up to me 'cuz they can do it too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
&quot;OK and next.. I'll moderate anytime you guys want me to.. it's the whole purpose of this topic.. ALL guilds should have representation here, I can personally guarantee that many smaller and lower lvl guilds and players don't even know this vote is going down and they should.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd moderate too if I had the time. I would like to think I'm doing my part to help my server community. That's what irked me initially is that the mods/admin do this on their time without compensation and have to put up with a TON of BS. As for guild representation, I agree. I think guilds should speak up if they think they're getting the short end of the stick. Honestly though, I can't see that they are.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now as far as pot shots.. Man trust me if I had beef <br>
I'd come right out and say it, you got the wrong M.O. on me big man. I am really not to concerned with all that noise.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll apologize for that comment as it wasn't directed solely at you. I perceived your post as another pot shot at the mods and I guess my anger got the better of me.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Hikaru my man you gotta calm down and take a sip of Robitussin. I am not personally attacking anyone. And I will admit I may have used the word Uber in a misdirecting manner, what I mean is the lower lvls and the non well know guilds(is that better Twiggie?).&quot;<br>
<br>
Robitussin is gross...just give me a Nyquil before bed and you won't hear a peep from me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Again, sorry for blasting you. <br>
<br>
Like I said, I know where you're coming from. Every guild and individual likes to think they're worth something and they are. This is a game and like all games they are meant to be FUN, bottom line. However, at the same time I think not everyone is gonna be able to accomplish the same things, or at least to the same level as those who are perceived as &quot;uber&quot;. Rangers /drool at my TV all the time but I tell em that they too can get it if they try hard enough. Communicate, be civil, and bide your time and you'll see things come easier for you IMHO. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

<br>
Okay, first, none of the guilds on Brell are &quot;Uber.&quot; I don't know what some ppl consider Uber, but what we got ain't it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, tell me something. Why DO the larger, more powerful guilds use the boards? I mean, there are SO many advocates for FFA/FCFS in those guilds, why are they bothering with keeping with accepted policy?<br>
<br>
Why don't they take internal votes, and decide for THEMSELVES what their gaming situation will be like for them. Why let any outside interferences affect them at all? <br>

<br>
There are people in SR/Watchers/Enshadowed/Etc that could care less about indies/small guilds/etc and would be fine never reading this board or caring about anyone but their own guild.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the coin there are people in those guilds that care about the reputation of their guild to the rest of the server, and work hard to preserve it as a good one.  This board and respecting what is voted on, reserved and otherwise is their way of doing that.<br>
<br>
Luckily the number of people in the second catagory largely outnumber the people in the first.  Not defending either position, cause its all about how you view the game.<br>
<br>
This board is very much pro toward indies and small guilds.  The guilds with the power to do basically whatever they want are proposing and conforming to reservation lists and other forms of limiting,  when they could just as easily be doing whatever they wanted.  The recent FCFS movement (hehe, sounds like some huge national issue) is because there are enough people in these large guilds that DO care about idies and small guilds that we think it would work... and more efficiently than it has been done in the past, when the rules were made for a different Norrath than is present currently.<br>

<br>
Is it also true of Silent Redemption? Do the majority of the players in SR oppose a reservation system? Do they oppose flexibility in how we look at mobs and adjust the rules that guide our community on Brell? What about Enshadowed?<br>

Again, I'm not pointing fingers...I'm just kind of taking a pulse here of what's going on around us.<br>

As any good social scientist or lawyer knows, you can guarantee the outcome of an answer or survey by asking leading questions in certain ways. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do the majority of the players in SR oppose a reservation system? Do they oppose flexibility in how we look at mobs and adjust the rules that guide our community on Brell? &quot;<br>
<br>
The second question here is a classic example of such a question. It sounds like a reasonable question at first glance but it seems to presuppose the wrongness of opposing reservations. As if part of flexibility wasn't the ability to eliminate reservations where necessary or desirable. <br>
<br>
Just something I always find interesting about the arguments made on these boards. There's a lot of these questions floating around out there. <br>
<br>
In response to the main question of this thread, if the top three guilds on this server banded together and demonstrated what an uberguild truly was for about a month, there would be no further whining about the way this board is run. First, cause the board would no longer exist, cause noone would pay attention to the reservations. Nor would there be any question that the larger guilds on this server have bent over backwards to make things easy on small guilds. Course, you'd probably have a hard time to convince them to go back to their old guild when the month was over. Not having to listen to the constant bitching on this board would be a huge weight off most our backs. <br>
<br>
Every time I see people bitch about uberguilds, or say that somehow people in SR have it in for them, or oppose fairness, or any of these other silly comments, it just cracks me up. You obviously have no concept of the reality of the situation. Its like handing a dollar to someone then having them bitch they wanted a five.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

Truth is I don't think it would ahve changed anything to keep it as an intentions board... I mean really what was the point?<br>
<br>
That's been the issue all along and why the vote was held.  Intentions don't equal reservations no matter how many times you'd like it to... <br>
<br>
Harpers has seen that first-hand more than once and it wasn't due to 'uber-guilds' it was do to jerks who won't follow through on thier word and I won't get into who.  That's for us to know and I have yet to see a rant publicly on it... don't ask me why but we deal with it by knowing who to ignore in game generally...  That may or may not mean a guild but we talk about it and give warnings internally.  <br>
<br>
I like it that way... I also like discussing it with a guild one on one, representative to representative...  someone rants and the flames die to a scorched bit of board camping someone posted and does effectively nothing but tick off some folks who now won't talk to each other while the point of it all gets lost.<br>
<br>
If it kills some of the rants section down a bit, frankly I'm all for the intentions to be gone... just got confusing all around and it was making things difficult to play in areas that shouldn't have been, places that folks weren't allowed to reserve.<br>
<br>
Now if there are areas out there you have been trying to take on constantly being taken ahead of you perhaps someone should look into bringing <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> that</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> issue to the boards for a possible reservation vote... I don't see a point in doing anything else. <p><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" font color=#8A2BE2>Bristlebane's best to you all,<br>

<br>
I especially like the word flexability there.  People have different ideas of what they want the server to be.  People have different ideas of what we should do.  Many people have opposed the reservation system and many have not.  Sure we talk a lot but in the end Dexn our vote counts no more then yours. Our opinion has no more value then what people want to give it.<br>
<br>
Ideas have been proposed to change the server reservation status.  Are you so &quot;inflexable&quot; that you won't consider a opinion opposite of yours?  Are you so inflexable that you feel people don't have the right to think that way?  Maybe you are being inflexable in your thinking?  You vote yes I vote no.. but I'm being inflexable?  I like this system you like that system but it is me being inflexable not you?  I gave my reasons for my vote..you gave your reasons for yours.  Is it my side that is stuck in the mud or yours?<br>
<br>
I find it funny.  Actually I find it insulting.  That you would come question my flexability or that of my friends.  We built the reservation system with others Dexn.  We have honored it for over a year now.  Thousands of reservations have crossed before us and we have respected every one.  The system is at it's heart based on &quot;flexability&quot; and compromise.  And we were there day one making it work.  Don't throw that question at me... it is insulting.<br>
<br>
Your first question is something you should ask yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyway, tell me something. Why DO the larger, more powerful guilds use the boards? I mean, there are SO many advocates for FFA/FCFS in those guilds, why are they bothering with keeping with accepted policy?<br>

<br>
Ask yourself why we do.  Go through the list of possible reasons:<br>
<br>
Give me one good selfish reason why we bother?  Or better yet give me one good unselfish reason why we bother?  I would love to hear why you think a guild like SR respects every reservation on the board?<br>
<br>
Then ask yourself why you use the boards.  Why do you bother.  Are your two answers the same?<br>

<br>
Anyway FcFs helps the different time zones people play from. Reservations only cause things to become very inflexable about how you can try this or that thing out.<br>
<br>
Its funny how forgiving people are and how smoothe it seem to go at times. You have no idea how many times I have talked with someone I knew that had an intention for something we raided earlier, just telling them when we killed what if our raid got close to their so they knew when it was spawned. Most seemed to be very happy about this.<br>
<br>
The minute you make something a reservation people wont move one inch to make it work accross timezones.<br>
<br>
I dont want a server where anyone run around a sneak past each other and KS without talking together. I never have and never will do that. I dont think anyone in the server really want that.<br>
