<br>
they are promising the same stuff with "legends" as they have since they were about to release Kunark.<br>
<br>
ive been playing the game since it was brand new, ive been there for all the lies, ive been there for all the flopped expansions, ive been there for all hard times, all the nerfed things...<br>
<br>
if you dont know about all the lies they have fed us... go find em out.  <br>
<br>
my main point is Legends is the biggest load of horse crap ive run across in my three years in this game.  the seperate teams thing is crap... 2 months into legends, you wont find hide nor hair of a gm on any regular server, and id say within 3-4 they will start to raise the access fee on all servers..<br>
<br>
im way more than dissapointed in verant.... and i wish there was something to do as a gaming community that we could do to finally have our voice heard.  Effectivey a protest, strike, piket.. (i know my spelling sucks, so you dont have to tell me)...<br>
<br>
but half of you think this crap is good, and decent.. and "we should have to pay for it".....<br>
<br>
Verant is the one that promised it to its customers in the first place... i didnt just pull it out of my arse.  now, they want to make us pay more to have the things they kept saying there were gonna do anyways...<br>
<br>
/rude verant<br>
<br>
im done... if any of you boobs wanna question any of this.. go ahead, i dont care...   you would let the world go to hell around you, and not even care as long as you had your little l33t dude running around... paying half your weekly pay check every month to have those services the rest of us were promised and denied...<br>
<br>
i hope you go broke <p><p ALIGN=center><IMG SRC="http://jbob147.homestead.com/files/poster.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18522">My Magelo Profile</a></p>

<br>
why do they tell us things like &quot;in the bazaar you can set up your PC as an NPC merchant yadda yadda yadda&quot; and then not do it? I bet they pulled it, so they could put it on legends instead.<br>
<br>
mt point is that they should @#%$ FIX the current servers, and give us what they said they would before making some hardcore &quot;1337&quot; server (that will be fully populated with gimps anyways).<br>
<br>
anything they can implement on legends that will improve gameplay SHOULD (and could) be implemented on the normal servers also. why would they only make the game for 8000 people when they can make it better for 400 000? seems really @#%$ lame to me. and the only reason they can do it is because idiots sign up for it.<br>
<br>
it's really insane IMO. <p><br><center><a href=mailto:voronwe@twoface.net><img src=http://twoface.net/eq/banner2.jpg border=0 alt="[give me sight beyond sight]"></a><br><font size=2>Voronwe Thundercat - 60 Paladin - <a href=http://legacyofsteel.net>Legacy of Steel</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthormiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thormiel</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/7/02 2:52:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My EQ Legends Journal....Some info</span><hr size=1> Somebody asked why didn't they raise the price a few dollars for everyone and use that money to fix the bugs and provide better service.

I cant understand why people who are this pissed off at a game/company continue to play.<br>
<br>
There have been lots of stuff that has frustrated me at certain times, but I must say I am basically happy with my class now and have enjoyed the game more than it has bothered me.<br>
<br>
Voronwe pointed out one major thing the promised and didn't deliver , so far, the bazaar.  But I am kinda dissapointed with your response Keyn, I really want to know (maybe some one else can list) all the stuff that has been promised and we deserve.  I dont really want to go research it my self.  Your comments are so vague.  The best way to convince people of your argument is to use specefic examples.  <br>
<br>
For the first few years I played EQ I didnt really read any boards, so maybe I am missing alot of stuff.<br>
<br>
I guess the point I was trying to make if you dont like what they are doing Stop Playing.  <br>
<br>
Verant is trying to make money not friends.  Many people on this board will argue that in the long run Legends will not make them more money it will cost them.  Thats a valid argument, I think.  But its not our decision, its their game and they are going to do whatever they want with it.<br>
<br>
I would have not kept playing if I was as angry as some people out there.  Maybe this has to do with the fact that I am just a casual player.<br>
<br>
Anyways I wont bother posting anymore on this thread, although I will be interested in seeing what happens with the server.  I would love to see some people mention specific stuff that we have been promised (maybe I shouldn't as for this if it will turn me as bitter as some) rather than vague comments.<br>

<br>
I LOVE EQ. I play it like 5 nights a week and I enjoy every minute of it.<br>
<br>
my problem is that they release stuff that sounds awesome (like act of valor) and it doesn't work. or they tell us how the bazaar is gonna be amazing, and then never do it.<br>
<br>
I don't understand (from a making money perspective) why verant thinks it's a good idea to give amazing things to 8000 people while ignoring the other 400 000 PAYING customers. that's just bad business in both ethics and in keeping a loyal customer base.<br>
<br>
EQ IS the best game out there right now. it blows anarchy online and daoc out of the water. that's the only reason anyone is here still. god knows it isn't some loyalty to verant. I think verant is a horrible company. they treat the people who pay their rent like @#%$...and that's bad business...plain and simple. this is just the latest outrageous business move on their part.<br>
<br>
I, for one, fully expect it to bite them in the butt as soon as a game equal to, or better than EQ comes out.<br>
<br>
the ONLY thing verant has going for it is a great game. once there is some worthwhile competition, EQ WILL die. <p><br><center><a href=mailto:voronwe@twoface.net><img src=http://twoface.net/eq/banner2.jpg border=0 alt="[give me sight beyond sight]"></a><br><font size=2>Voronwe Thundercat - 60 Paladin - <a href=http://legacyofsteel.net>Legacy of Steel</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaelodyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelodyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/7/02 3:29:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/roevernon/images/Aeltn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My EQ Legends Journal....Some info</span><hr size=1> I plan on jumping to Star Wars Galaxies, Neverwinter Nights, World of Warcraft...anything really at this point.

You guys all think that going to Legends is for some fat ass rich people who can't make it big on normal servers. I don't want to be big, ALL the people I have talked to on the boards said they wanted to go for GM events and support. You pay more for a better warranty, why not pay more for better support? God I thought everyone here was nice and pleasent but no, I just found out half of you are pretty selfish craps and the other sneezy level 60 paladins that are worried about the spot light being taken away from you.

I am also interested in knowing the services that were promised to us by VI but were denied. I have played the game since it first came out, and I couldn't think of anything except the Bazaar features at the moment. VI most certainly didn't promise dynamic quests, character pages, legendary items, and interactive maps.<br>

If you hate VI so much to the extend of wanting them to go broke, why are you still paying them $10 every month? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utherus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Therus</A> at: 2/7/02 9:56:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaervoth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aervoth</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://home.austin.rr.com/cov/xiconvalor.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/7/02 10:22:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ???</span><hr size=1> Ok sorry, thought that was directed at me.

Yeah, I could easily afford it. That is not the point.<br>
<br>
I and many others like me have been playing this game going on 3 years (God has it been that long). Busting our asses to get a leg up and have a good time while doing it. I would never purport to be some uber-l33t paladin, this isn't about me me me. <br>
<br>
One of the selling points with Legends is that some of the more uber players on the server may get items named after them. This totally pisses me off. Why in the hell should some guy who pays $40 a month get some kick ass item named after him? That is total crap. If some jackass paladin no one ever heard of got some kick ass peice named after him because he bought into VI's little scheme to make more money, I would have my cursor hanging over the destroy key.<br>
<br>
If they are going to name items after people why not name them after the players in this game who have MADE A DIFFERENCE. If your going to name a paladin item after a PC paladin then name it after Kruegen for being the most well known and probably most uber paladin across all servers. Or name it after Beldukil for doing all he has done for paladins on all servers.<br>
<br>
They have always been promising more GM events. They have had a few very good ones. More often than not though a GM event consists of spawning mass undead in EC or QH and slaughtering noobs. A long time ago The Nameless had a GM who loved to do events and ran some interesting story lines. Some in the community didn't like his style because he could be heavy handed with some of the less RP-minded players. He ran some good GM events though. That was what got him fired from my understanding. Now they want to have a server with more dynamic events like that GM liked to run so long ago...yeesh.<br>
<br>
The new interfaces should be put on all servers. I am sorry but I just don't see how this new map system and such can be costing them soooo much money.<br>
<br>
More GMs? WTH maybe if VIs CS team gave their guides a little more room to work they wouldn't need to advertise better customer service. EVERY Guide story I have ever read has been a horror story regarding lead GMs and VI CS reps. Guides are paid nothing to listen to whiny players and put up with childish antics, and meanwhile get treated like @#%$ for being vollunteers. Nice. And you wonder why they are sometimes less than helpful when you complain about soandso stealing your Derv camp. The CS problem could be fixed with some changes to the guide program IMO.<br>
<br>
Legends is a slap in the face to everyone who pays their $10 a month expecting to get what was originally advertised. Legends is a slap in the face to every hardcore gamer who has &quot;tested&quot; out new zones (ToV) and scripts (Sleeper) for VI on live servers.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong I am not a bitter EQ player. Far from it. I love the game. Otherwise I wouldn't be playing it everynight of the week. Just don't expect to get any kudos out of me for anything accomplished on the Legends server. If you chose to go, hey its your $380 a year, I prefer renters insurance over Legends. I wouldn't expect the rank and file EQ player to be drooling all over your pathetic little web page with all your uber-l33t gear. Or anyone to give a rats ass the first time you kill the AoW or when you wake the sleeper. <br>
<br>
Have a nut on legends, I would keep a low profile though. <p><a href=" http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45034 ">Berton Strongheart</a> 60th Crusader<BR><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=41843">Stroh Tanglefoot</a> 43rd Druid<BR><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=89605">Steet Teews</a> 32nd Halfling Goddess and Stabber of Backs<BR><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net">Legacy of Steel</a><BR><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bnamelesstavern.html">Nameless</a><BR>"I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus doing something very stupid, and I decided to go ahead anyway."<BR>

<br>
I think berton makes an awesome point with naming weapons. why in the world shouldn't there be a &quot;shining spear of tigole&quot;?<br>
<br>
instead we'll see &quot;burnt blade of backstabbarx&quot; - some 14 year old brat who got his mommy to shell out 40 clams a month to become an EQ &quot;legend&quot;. F that.<br>
<br>
like tig said in his update, &quot;And as a friendly reminder -- to all you moving to the Legends server -- please keep in mind:  We're laughing AT you, not with you&quot;<br>
<br>
true words...and trust me, we WILL be laughing. <p><br><center><a href=mailto:voronwe@twoface.net><img src=http://twoface.net/eq/banner2.jpg border=0 alt="[give me sight beyond sight]"></a><br><font size=2>Voronwe Thundercat - 60 Paladin - <a href=http://legacyofsteel.net>Legacy of Steel</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvoronwehonorbound.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Voronwe Honorbound</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://twoface.net/eq/can.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 12:31:15 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://twoface.net/eq/vorohead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ???</span><hr size=1> as for &quot;I'm going because I want to move to a different SERVER&quot;<br>
<br>
hahaha, I'll go ahead and call you on that. that's a straight up lie. it's BS. you can move to a different server for a $50 fee - that's less than TWO MONTHS on this ghey new server. why would you want to play $30 more PER MONTH to change servers?<br>
<br>
you're either a horrible liar or a horrible mathematician. or both.<br>
<br>
and if for some reason, you got $30 a month to throw around for nothing, drop me an email. <p><br><center><a href=mailto:voronwe@twoface.net><img src=http://twoface.net/eq/banner2.jpg border=0 alt="[give me sight beyond sight]"></a><br><font size=2>Voronwe Thundercat - 60 Paladin - <a href=http://legacyofsteel.net>Legacy of Steel</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utherus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Therus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/8/02 12:36:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ???</span><hr size=1> I just don't see why people get so upset with the Legend's Server. Would I get upset with the first class passengers who get better service, more comfortable seats, than myself who fly on the economy class? Hmm, I won't because those people are willing to pay more money for the improved features. Likewise, why would I get upset for people getting cool named items?  Especially when those people are willing to pay $30 per month while I am not willing to?<br>
<br>
Neither named items, new interface, character pages, nor tons of dynamic quests were advertised features for regular EQ customers. Yes, customer service can use some improvement, but from my own personal experience, I think it is adequate. I have had a lot of interactions with GMs, all of which were handled very promptly, and more importantly, all the GMs/Guides I met were very courteous.<br>
<br>
I guess from your logic, first class/business class seats are a slap in the face to all people travelling on economy class. Or premium service from a cable company is a slap in the face to all people using the regular service, or any company which offers different levels of service to their customer is a slap in the face to the customers with the basic service. Hmm.<br>

and about legend server <br>
i think most people are pissed of the VI adds<br>
more GM which should have been on all server <br>
and GM event , which VI said they were going to make a lot of<br>
them , they patched 4 zones for 4 days and that was there idea of GM event ( it wasn't that bad , but there was no story ) <br>
<br>
naming stuff on players name is a big issue for a lot also<br>
why name it on this guy and not on that ?<br>
naming that bow in ring quest after the guy who first finshed it was good thing , he worked HARD on the quest<br>
<br>
i don't want naming stuff for people just coz they have quests/zone i don't get till later , and found it droped on the floor <br>
<br>
any way , i still think legend is a test server with X4 cost of <br>
normal servers , i feel its not hard to work in markiting in VI  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14333.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14333.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14333.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=14333.topic&start=81&stop=88>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=14333.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=14333.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=14333.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=14333.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14333.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14333.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Old World<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">New World<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
