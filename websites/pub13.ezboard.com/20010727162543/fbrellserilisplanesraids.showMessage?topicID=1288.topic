A lot of the lower lvl guilds are signing up now because they know it will be about 9 months before they come close to getting a VS spot. <br>
<br>
The thing I see wrong with this is, What about the guilds that can handle a VS raid right now? If your guild was called to run a VS raid this week do you think you could do it? What about a guild like SR (sorry for using your name) if they were called upon to raid VS this week do you think they could do it? I would not doubt it at all, but instead for them to get a VS raid set up they have to wait another 9 months.<br>
<br>
With how long this list is I do not blame anyone for trying to get a spot now. 9 Months is a long time for a raid that will end in an hour! I feel that the list has grown because of this though. Everyone wants a spot and they figure if they wait till they can actually handle VS they will have to wait another 9 months before they can set up the raid. <br>
<br>
Its just a sad thing that its come to this, but what can you expect? A mob like VS who drops Phat Lewt! You knew it was coming.<br>

<br>
I think we all understand people's overwhelming feelings when they look at a list that's 9 months long.<br>
<br>
If one small guild recognizes their lack of support to kill Venril, do you think they'll withdraw?  Of course not.  In 9 months, they figure they'll have the support they need.<br>
<br>
Even if they don't, they can create a sign-up and get the 20 or so people that attend almost every one of these raids.<br>
<br>
I wonder.  If SR started inviting a smaller guild to our Venril and Trakanon raids... say &lt;Knights Reknown&gt; and we did a pure random with all of your members that were present on the raid, would you guys consider yanking yourselves out of the rotations to cut down on the length?   <br>
<br>
Maybe that's the solution.  Have the larger guilds bring along the smaller guilds. <p>Ganon Stormwynd <BR>

I know that Merryband and Darkguard are teaming up for VS, and Lost Adventurers and Knights Reknown are as well.  We jointly raided VS a couple of weeks ago when our turn came up and it was great.  Several of us got to see VS for the first time, and we had a hell of a lot of fun.  I'm looking forward to our next shot at him, even though I'll probably be level 60 by then. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Teaming up for raids is something that can be done to reduce the size of the VS list (I'm still a bit low for Trakanon, so I can't speak from experience there) without having to go through a server-wide vote or having to deal with a bunch of bureaucratic issues.  It's also something that can be done irregardless of whether you're in a guild or not (we all have friends, and most of us that are 50+ probably have a friend (if not several) on the VS rotation.)  Truthfully, I think that having the opportunity to raid VS (or Trak for that matter, most likely) more frequently would be well worth giving up exclusive control of loot rules and such.  I hope that some folks will give the idea of teaming up for raids to shorten the lists some serious thought.<br>

So far this is what I have come up with: First off all the smaller guilds would just love that idea and it could even help some of the bigger guilds get a good solid raid going. <br>
<br>
However I feel this can be a little unfair to guilds such as SR. As Vumil pointed out most VS raids are about 36people. If SR was to combine with another guild they would have to replace some SR members with the guild they were taking under there wing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If LA, Darkguard and SR were the only guilds doing this, SR would still have to wait a few months before the rest of the members who did not get to go on the first one have a chance.<br>
<br>
So far I see about 36 different raids on the VS list. <br>
If every guild teamed up on this list that would lower the list to 18. 18 Raids for VS is still alot but its a start.<br>
<br>
If this did happen though I would hope the server came to aggrement and the other guilds start combining. Not only would it split the VS list in half but it would, on most cases, give you a good reason for signing up for VS. Lets just hope the other guilds would decide to do this and we never come up with a SR VS list <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     &quot;So who are we taking to VS this week?&quot; <br>
<br>
I respect the guilds like LA and Darkguard alot who would make an attempt to work things out in the VS rotation list by combining with guilds who without the help would not have a resonable reason for being on the list.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Ill reread this later to make sure I didnt say anything stupid hehe.<br>

<br>
DG teams up with Merry band.  12 +6 = 18 people.<br>
<br>
Not wholly fair.  It's a start maybe, but because you can't force people to team up, the ones that care about the rotation and team up are just getting penalized further.<br>
<br>
It's the smaller guilds that should be teaming up.  I'll admit, perhaps MB + DG isn't much, at only 18 people.  Only 3 wizards, 3 chanters in there.  Perhaps we SHOULD have another ally to be fair.  Why though?  Nobody else is going to do it, and we're just killing our chances at VS. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udulcineia01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dulcineia  01</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/25/01 10:11:55 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/dulcineia01?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Overcrowding on the Rotation Lists</span><hr size=1> You have a good point adun, teaming up is nice, fair, and would help alot, but why do it?<br>
Granted, i just listed three reasons, plus the fact that it would create more friendships, and let everyone get to know each other.  But in reality, why team up with another guild, when you could just both sign up, then team up each time and do it twice?  Right now it is on an honor system, and, sorry to say, that does not seem to be working.  Maybe a vote should be taken about requiring VS raids to include members from at least two guilds?  Half and half? or 1/3 of another guild not signed up for VS?  I dont like the idea of requiring something in EQ, how the heck can you really enforce it?  But maybe if we all vote, and back each other up on this it would work.  I know its not great, but with so much complaining about VS(i've noticed this one example used repeatedly in many other discussions about the whole system, even if it is or is not indicative of all other raids), maybe it is our best shot.  It is the only solution i have heard proposed on this thread so far, and seems like a good one to me. <p>Dulcineia Delamancha<BR>

I think it's good to see people at least attempting to shorten the list on their own. I'd still like to see some guilds purposely take a INDY who is signed up below them, if that indy gets the epic loot, then they can remove their name from the list. Taking the &quot;I'm an Indy, I'm claiming my epic&quot; pressure off the list would be a big step in the right direction. Even as a guild if you claim one epic for yourself, there is still one to be randomed amoungst the others or even given to the Indy you take, in return for them taking their name off the list. I think the Indy's that are already on the list would also want to actively persue this, as it is a quicker means of getting their epic.<br>
