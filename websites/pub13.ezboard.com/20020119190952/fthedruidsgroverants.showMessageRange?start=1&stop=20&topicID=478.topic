For free. I appreciate the occasional donation, but I've even stopped refusing those these days. Why? Well, here are my many reasons: <BR> 1. Lets face it, its not all that difficult to cast a quick sow. At lvl 34 I have approx. 1200 mana. And sow costs a whopping 40. Insignificant. And meming spells doesnt take long, so its easy to remove a spell I have mem'd and throw sow in it, then replace the spell. <BR> 2. In my early days as a druid, pre-sow, I really appreciated all the sow's I got. And I remembered the thankfullness I felt for those who did it for free, so I'm returning the favor now, passing on the generosity so to speak. If everybody, and not just druids but clerics and enchanters and shamen, all cast their equivalent buffs that help us for free as well, we'd all have a much eaiser time of it in the game. <BR> 3. I've been getting a lot of resurrects lately. And almost none of them have accepted the donations I have offered, even though a number of them had to travel between zones to resurrect me. Its a time consuming process. If all these clerics are resurrecting us for free, saving us hours upon hours of time leveling, how can we in good conscience refuse to take the few seconds to sow someone, which may very well save THEIR life, and thus save them just as much time as the clerics save us? <BR>  <BR> Now teleports are a different story. If someone needs a teleport to a corpse because they died, I'll usually help them. Again, for free. But if someone wants me to come to them in West Commons and teleport them to North Karanas simply because they dont want to run through a few zones, its going to cost them. And if someone wants me to leave a camp to fetch them at oasis and teleport them somewhere for free, they can just forget it. <BR>  <BR> I'll also stop and buff (thorn shield, skin like *, strength, heals) anyone far lower than me who is in a fight that's somewhat risky. Same reasons, it could save their life and I would have appreciated it in my &quot;youth.&quot; <BR>  <BR> So my basic philosophy is help all those it doesnt hurt you to help, especially those in need, and especially the polite. If they want me to spend the time to take them somewhere just so they dont have to run there, then they should pay me for the inconvenience. And if they're rude, root for the orcs. <BR>  <BR> Ishmar Tedronai <BR> 34th season druid of The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Eldoraan</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(10/28/99 5:54:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> OK, I've got 3 characters and can speak from exp.</span><hr size=1> After reading all the whining and such from all classes regarding &quot;plight of the Druid&quot; for months, I decided to create 2 additional characters to see how they compare to Eldoraan. <BR>  <BR> The first is an Ogre Shaman, because an evil race has additional disadvantages, and Shaman have both DoT and SoW spells. <BR>  <BR> The second is a straight melee character - a warrior.

My Ogre can hit for some severe melee damage due to his strength and buffs. He regularly kills yellows and black/white con'd creatures with very little risk. My Warrior also regularly kills yellows and black/white, with an occasional red thrown in - ie I forgot to con that stupid mummy and assumed it was yellow. About as much &quot;downtime&quot; is spent with all of my characters either healing or medding or both. <BR>  <BR> At this point in time, all my players are fairly low in the level range. Eldoraan - WoodElf Druid, is level 22; Puhtz - Ogre Shaman, is level 14; and Nikii - WoodElf Warrior, is level 10. My findings may change in time, as each levels up further - but for now, the above claim is completely baseless. In fact, Eldoraan has died approximately 10 times more frequently than the other two characters. Nikii has only died twice in 10 levels!

I fully plan on staying Anon forever once I get group teleport. I'm all for helping people, but I don't like getting bombarded with requests for arts when I am trying to hunt... don't get me wrong, when I have down time I spoil newbies to death, free SoW, skin like steel and anything else I have memed at the time.  All of that with out their asking too.  I have had players my lvl come up to me and say,&quot; SoW me&quot; in exactly that manner. I ignore them.  <BR>  I think what we are all really whining about is a serious lack of respect.  Everyone appearantly thought that Druids were too strong a class, so our spells became less effective. Now the same people demand us to help them, for free and without thanks! Well no thanks! I'd rather not. <BR>  <BR>  <BR> Nokomis Elderwolf, <BR> lvl 27 woodland Druidess, <BR> Tarrew Marr <BR> Will perchase 20 bat wings from a lvl 2 player for 2 plat, but will not be a mobile SoW unit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Tealuan Willowroot</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/14/99 10:25:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Running from zone to zone</span><hr size=1> You may not remember but once upon a time(pre-lvl 14) we all had to run zone to zone without sow. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Laurison Cajunheart</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/15/99 6:54:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Do Druids have it too easy?</span><hr size=1>  <BR> I'm going to go in order of how I created characters on E Marr. 1st: DE sk to 17th, DE Wizard to 18th, Dwarf Paladin to 20th, DE Enchanter to 8th, Wood Elf Druid to 30th, Wood Elf Ranger to 24th. So as you can see I have had some experience with some popular classes. I can remember my Druid getting killed by 2 Low Blue Aviaks Guards at 26th when an extra popped earlier than I had medded and healed, on several different ocassions. My Ranger at 23rd could handle 2 High Blues, with 2 bubbles of health left. And yes, my Ranger was twinked by my Druid. My Ranger prefers to have a Druid in group, SoW is always great, plus Druids are wonderful healers, and buffs don't hurt either. I still play my Druid, and play my Ranger. Although my Druid has died, many more times than my Ranger. I do not think Druid's have it easy, or are overpowered. Druids are the masters of quick travel, that is they're greatest asset. And the higher levels you go, with ANY class, the harder it is to get EXP. As far as SoW, buffing, teleports, I routinely do this for free, and alot of times will simply pass out SoW's to newbies, etc. And sometimes, when I would ask some of these same ppl with my Ranger for help, bind, SoW, etc, You either pay for it, or no response. So I wish other ppl would quit whining about how selfish WE are. Have a great day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Aldreaath</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/20/99 8:17:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> class wide complaining contest....</span><hr size=1> it seems to me that almost every class complains about their shortcomings (the exception being bards...maybe I just don't know enough bards). <BR> IMHO it's just a question of how you play your character, keeping in mind that the majority of characters only do well in specific situations.  I'd like to complain about how us druids got the shaft (fire based spells, 3rd rate healers, armor&equipment, quests, group viability), but I can guess that almost every class can complain just as much (and in most cases more). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vidar>Vidar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/99 12:51:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> attitude</span><hr size=1> OK lets just make this simple. Most of the time I have found others giving me attitude. I always try to be nice, and am only rude to those who are rude to me first. Here are the rules I try and follow. <BR> 1.I will not sow/port/etc anyone if it will endanger my group - when I am oom and my group needs some heals that 60 mana is to valuable to be spent at that moment. <BR> 2.I will not sow/port/etc anyone who demands it - if you really can't live without these things maybe you are playing the wrong class. Try a druid. <BR> 3.If I am oom, but have plenty of time I will let the person know that I am oom but if they can wait I will be glad to help them out- I need a saftey factor on mana. So if I only have 1/2 a bub of mana I am going to wait a little bit before I spend any of it. <BR> 4.I need some compensation to port a complete stranger when I am not going that way - It costs too much mana (300) and takes too much time to do out of the goodness of my heart. I don't ask for much, just something. <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/udayhach.showPublicProfile>Dayhach</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/27/99 2:03:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/chris_pyles_41018/mage.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: attitude</span><hr size=1> i have become so sick of he constant  <BR>  <BR> Dayhauk slashes inferno goblin shaman for 10 points of dmg <BR> Dayhauk begins casting a spell <BR> Some goof says,'hey Dayhauk can you sow me' <BR> inferno gob shaman is hit by non melee for 99 dmg <BR> some goof says Dayhauk will you sow me? come on man i need sow' <BR>  <BR> it seems people tend to find you just because you are druid no matter weather you are fighting or not and get in your face begging for sow and what i have to laugh about is if you noticed i was useing the inferno gob as an example cause even indoors the pester the hell out of me for sow <p><b><i>Dayhach rogue tradesman and hater of all thats human*Dayhauk younger half brother of Dayhach and slave of nature druid with short fuse*Dragnoor friend of Dayhach and lover of all thats death*Venire master of elementals</b></i></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showMessageRange?topicID=478.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showMessageRange?topicID=478.topic&start=41&stop=56>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showMessage?topicID=585.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showMessage?topicID=571.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=478.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~msippel/thedruidsgrove/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.emailToFriend?topicID=478.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.threadControl?topicID=478.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=478.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=478.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm19">Admin/Mod Discussion<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm17">Admin Trash Bin<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm26">Admin History</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants>Rants</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
