druids bitched about their epics so now it is easy as @#%$ the 2 hard parts/bottle necks are gone now where as almost every other epic has a bottle neck of some sort.  Druid bitch and whine way to much and useualy get their way so i wont be surprised if everything you are complaining about today.  Now i am not saying other classes dont bitch some just are pro's at it some are newbs.  My room mate who plays a warrior showed me a thread that some one started about the green scale issue on sony's message boards the thread got locked with something like 4 or 5 replies.  So druids are a super needed class in the end game boo freaking hoo.  So your epic doesnt stack with this epic how many necro epics do you actualy see btw.  As for why you dont get ports to luclin it is a story line based thing period it is based on the existance of the wiz spires through out norrath there for tied to the wizzard class GEE DUH.  To end my post and i dont care if you do flame me you bitch to much i fully expect you to get everything you want cause druids always do.  Maybe this time you will shut the !@#$ up forever and we wont have to see this !@#$ anymore.

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I think one thing that has been overlooked in the druid proposal is the state of the classes prior to level 60.  Prior to the 50's, it is very hard for a cleric to compete for groups with a druid of similar level or a few levels higher.  Between ports and sow, it's nearly impossible.<br>
<br>
This *huge* advantage of the druid class must be paid for somewhere.<br>
<br>
Similarly, druids are well known to be among the best classes for soloing.  Clerics are well known for being among the worst.  This advantage must also be paid for somewhere.<br>
<br>
Thus far, it has been paid for by allowing the jack-of-all trades aspect to fade in utility as other classes mature into their own.  If you want to remove this deficit, where would you place the vulnerability?<br>

As a high end cleric I find that it is very difficult to get into groups in most high lvl areas due to the fact that druids and shaman can handle the role of a cleric well enough and still have other uses in the group.  <br>
<br>
However I can see the usefulness of a druid having increased heals on raids.  <br>
<br>
I understand wanting to have the epic changed and agree fully.  I like the ideas of having a cold based version of ro's.  However I find it upsetting that any common druid at post 55 lvls could have increased healing abilities to further put clerics out of a job when it comes to simple exp groups.  Most high lvl guilds at the high end game put in good time to getting AA points and I could understand a few Druid Class AA abilities being ones that could increase heals.  As for giving Druids teleportation abilities on the moon, while I can understand the IC reasons for the wizzies having the market on this I would like to see druids with them as well.  On the subject of PotG and Aego/blessing of aego stacking, I would rather have the druid have to recast PotG for themselves then have to recast blessing on a group of people who didnt click off PotG and I'm sure it will happen based on the amount of times enchanters had to recast C3 when they had stacking issues with C and C2.  I like the idea of the single target potg and perhaps have it not be overwritten by aego.  For the most part I wish you all well in getting your changes into the game.  <br>

I have several reasons for doing so, but first let me tell you about my main.  I play a necromancer and for the past two months I have busted my butt to get him up to level 36.  The members of the guild I belong to are thoroughly impressed that I have leveled as fast as I did.  <br>
First, as a Necromancer I will not be called on any raids unless it's guild sponsored.  This is due the fact that I refuse to be someone's twitch whore.  My pet is fairly effective and my offensive spells are pretty good.  <br>
Second, in the process of leveling as fast as I have I made my character a group character suitable in groups only.  I don't fear kite and solo.  In doing so I have managed to show those that have 50+ level characters who are playing their alts at my level and peoples mains my level that a necromancer is a very viable group class.  <br>
Third, if you want to talk about balancing then give Necros the ability to port into undead zones only and make sure VI gives us at least apprehensively faction with Mistmoor etc.. so that way we don't die upon porting.  <br>
Fourth, my heal spells are more mana efficient than even a clerics but the downside is that it literally kills me.  I've played healer in a group with my necro and there were times that I was killed because I healed too much when the main assist pulled too much.  The downside to a necro is yes we can heal, but it takes up most of our mana and our health.  This makes life tapping unusable because we used our mana to heal.<br>
Fifth, my necro has mastery in offense and defense, very good in dodge, and excellent in piercing yet even a cleric out damages me in melee.  This is a serious inbalance when considering that said cleric hasn't meleed hardly at and doesn't have the skills I do.  Part of the drawbacks to my class and I live with it.  Due to my high levels in melee I am often put in charge of defending the clerics and assist the tank.  When the tank calls for zone run I stay behind and cover the other casters escape.  Sometimes I die and sometimes I don't.  If these other casters don't follow the order for the zone run after 10 or 15 seconds of being called I run for the zone.  Reason being is that usually the tank is dead and the majority of my group is also.  <br>
My job also entails doing a corpse recovery no matter how many died or where they died.  The worst CR I've ever done to date was the night before necros got the lesser summon corpse spell and we were in the gobbie mines in LOIO.  The party, except for me, died down in there deep next to the gobbie lord and his pet.  I spent three hours recovering 5 corpses and the reason why it took so long was because I couldn't have track corpse and gather shadows up at the same time while underground/dungeons.  I spent those hours wandering around in an area I didn't have a map for invised with no track corpse.  A drawback, but also earned me quite a few good friends that knew that they could count on me to get them out of a difficult spot.  <br>
The basic moral of this is simple: Learn to play your class within your limitations and use your strengths to the best advantage given to you.  BTW one of my very good friends is a 42nd level druid and she wasted a few hours buffing me, porting me around etc... so I could complete the early stages of my epic.  Also Shamans and Druids are my best friend because of hit point regen.  When I get that I become a mana battery due to my Allure of Death line of spells, which makes me have less downtime between pulls so I can nuke/dot/slow the mobs that are pulled and the tanks don't suffer as much damage.  Which turns means the cleric saves more mana because they heal less and the healing gets spread around to the druids/shamans that I'm grouped with.  It's matter of tactics pure and simple.  Instead of concentrating on solo tactics I developed group tactics and all of the groups that I been with have commented on how well I help out to drop the mobs we're facing.  <br>
The choice is yours on how you want to play with your limitations.  From all the posts above in this thread necros are mentioned hardly at all because most ppl that are non-necros have never had the pleasure of grouping with one.  Druids actually have a better chance of getting into a group than a necro of any level.  I get groups really easy because I have busted my ass to earn other peoples respect in my abilities to play my class and the way I will readily die for them so they can get away.<br>

Wow, you suck at drawing analogies.  I'm comparing YOUR HEAL to SHAMAN HEAL.  Shamans do not get a direct heal.  They get a heal over time.  You get a direct heal, therefore you should not get a heal over time.  Can you comprehend that, or is that still too vague for your simple mind?<br>

<br>
I see this is a main stumbling block for all people that can't see this.  I shall attempt to explain this another way.  Clerics are the healers of the game.  They are all powerful.  They alone have the most powerful spell in the game...complete heal.  No other class shall get this spell.  After that, their 2 main heals are Elixir, and Divine Light...both of which are BETTER than the counterparts of the other priest classes...which are Torpor and Natures Touch.  This is the way it should be.  Clerics should ALWAYS be better healers than druids, and shamans for that matter.  By increasing Natures Touch, you in essence, become a BETTER HEALER THAN A CLERIC in situations where CH is not necessary...which seems to be what you're bitching about.  I don't understand why you people draw comparisons to fully buffed 7k hp tanks and how well you can heal them WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR GODDAMNED JOB TO DO SO.  The druid is not asked to heal the MT on a raid....so what is your issue here? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  It is totally free damage so long as the mob can be snared. More and more mobs can't be snared or resist our epic so much that the epic effect is useless.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So, if it can't be snared, a druid usually wouldn't be soloing it right?  And if you're in a group, having it snared isn't as big of a deal, right?  So, again, where is the problem here?  Please, ask your local necromancer how he  feels about his epic.  Any epic enabled necro loves it to death...he doesn't whine about the 1 mob in each zone that can't be snared, he avoids the mob.  Take a hint.  You're not supposed to be 100% effective against all mobs in the game.  How does a necro feel against trakanon?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Druids cast Fire and Cold damage spells. From early on Druids have cold based Rain spells.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do you get a cold based Debuff at level 24 too? Then why should you get one at 60?  I'm lost.  You want a rain at 60?  I guess that's what you're saying.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  We do not want to be better than everyone at everything. We haven't even  asked to be better than everyone at anything.

<br>
You have asked to be better than everyone.  You have asked to be a better healer, which I demonstrated above, the shaman community came here and kicked your ass for asking to be the best at DOT's, and you want ports in luclin, which wizards don't even have.  A jack of all trades is one who can do all things ADEQUATELY and, i'm sorry if you yourself can not, but I know many druids that can, and do, on a daily basis.<br>

<br>
I love this part.  This part undermines your entire argument, because it proves your class envy, which I think is totally ridiculous in EQ.  First off, show me where I say I'm a shaman.  Please.  I compare your class to shamans because shamans are the other healing class underneath clerics in the heirarchy.  If you must know, the character Vaaxx VLok is a dark elf warlock..level 60 necro.  I speak not as a necro, I speak as an intelligent person who can assess ALL classes in the game.  This is something that people who write up ridiculous petitions can't do. <br>
<br>
They think that their class sucks because they can't do everything.  They want to have torpor, they want to have healing wave of prexus, they want to have sunstrike, they want to have malo, they want cannabalize, they want funeral pyre of kelador, and the list goes on and on.<br>
<br>
You keep saying how you can't heal on raids...how does a shaman feel?  On debuff AE's, you don't heal with elixirs or Torpor...and torpor is group only.  That shaman is chaining chloroblasts on your tank fighting the mob quadding for 600's.  Druids are contributing far more healing power than shamans are on raids because they are doing it FASTER.  Torpor doesn't save casters.  Natures Touch does. My warrior has died before because my shaman couldn't keep up with damage output with just chloroblast.  Druid could have with Natures Touch.  On a side note, lets take all Nature's Touch's out of druids spellbooks and place them only on guardian wurms in veeshan's peak.  If you think that's unfair, please, talk to your mighty Oracles on your server-- and not just the ones in the uber guild.  See how many of them are still using Chloroblast because their heal wasn't a vendor spell at 60.<br>
<br>
Before you start making up hilarious requests, and giving the intelligent people of the world some humor for their daily reading, take a look at other sides of things.  Class A is always getting picked before Class B for this group because Class B can't do this as well.  I'm sure that's the case, however i'm also sure there are things class B can do a lot better than class A.  I wonder how many druids would be willing to give up their invis, their ports, their SoW, their damage shields, just to heal like a cleric.<br>
<br>
This game isn't always about min/maxing.  If you're not getting picked for pickup groups, chances are, you're a dumbass.  If you know how to play your class, people will ask you to come group with them.  My main hunting group is a 60 warrior, 60 shaman 60 druid 56 monk.  Up until today, the shaman was 59...which meant no torpor.  The druid healed just fine, on his own (oddly enough, if you believe half the bullshit spouted in that petition,) everywhere...we did seb crypt with a 51 rogue instead of the monk...and never had any issues.  We've done top of skyshrine, we can do xp areas of kael, we can do Akheva.  Yah, my warrior has 4500hp buffed, but the damage output in XP groups is not sufficient to warrant a better heal, and when the damage output is sufficient, a cleric is required...also negating the need for a better druid heal.<br>
<br>
If we want to do better things, then we pick up a cleric...but as soon as the cleric is there, the druid becomes a secondary healer...and guess what..he performs that role excellently too!<br>
<br>
Seriously folks, you're not a goddamned druid in real life.  It's time to take a look at how things are from the other 14 classes in the game, and stop thinking about your precious toon with 100 days played.<br>

I say that's BS...<br>
<br>
What you're doing there (knowingly or not knowingly) is creating a class SO powerful, that can replace the cleric class in game at ANY level, leaving no use for clerics (maybe except rez, but I'm sure druids have/will whine(d) about that that one as well (btw if you look around other forums you'll see a lot of stupid requests by druids).<br>
<br>
There's a druid on my server that clears a whole zone by himself day in day out. and he sells everything needed there by other classes (MQ) all the time. Now you'll give this guy a better dot, better epic, better heal, more ports, better buffs... thank you very much.<br>
<br>
And btw will one of you please come in here and answer the ppl that disagree with you. I myself feel like an idiot for posting this, because 90% of you whiners that just post a msg saying /agree there just so their classes can overwhelm every other class in the game won't come in here and read my post.<br>
<br>
And did you realize that NO other class wants druids to be better in what they do? I guess you should, because most ppl think that your ideal druid will leave their classes behind.<br>

Get a grip.<br>
<br>
Perhaps what the petition lacks is big bold type saying &quot;Yes, we're asking for something, ANYTHING, to keep playing the END GAME.&quot;<br>
<br>
-pompous ass part-<br>
<br>
And please, if you think your little adventures into the halls of testing are the end game, then ya dont know.  If your idea of killing a god is waxing Innoruk, then ya dont know.  We're not talking to you, and your opinions about what classes can and can not contribute to a high end raid are wrong.<br>
<br>
Get back to me after a 30+ minute fight with the burrower beast, or seru, or countless other mobs you're just beginning to read about on the almighty FoH board.  Hey guess how many druids they need for em!  Guess how many even still bother to attend?<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
It simply amazes me that people who have played the game 6 months or even a year think they actually know the high end game.  And then they have the guts to comment on not only the high end game, but the abilities of other classes in the high end game...  that's really something.<br>
<br>
But people cant even read the petition correctly.  We still have shamans in this thread saying NT heals 988 of damage...  Really can only put it one way, same as Aidon did.  Play a 60 druid for a while.  On a raid.   A real raid.  Then get back to us.<br>

-------------------------------------------------------<br>
I'm sorry, are you asking to form a Nature's Touch rotation on raids? No? Then wtf is your main problem in comprehending this issue? Is your group dying to AE? Then why don't you tell them to get the @#%$ out of the goddamned AE, or get better resist gear, or get off your raid. Please, list all encounters where the AE can not be mitigated by resists, or geometry, or intelligence.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Did we say that AE was the only problem when it comes to a druid's healing power?  As you obviously do not play a backup healer class (or possibly you play one poorly), allow me to explain.  On a typical raid, you have clerics who heal main tanks, or else tanks in general, and then you have everyone else.  Currently, druids would like to be able to heal these 'everyone else', yet are unable to function in this role..  We call this &quot;backup healing&quot;.<br>
<br>
AE can be one cause, Rampage can be another, riposte can be another, Nukes are another, a missed evade can be another.  So while yes, resists and geometry can be used to avoid some ae, that is not the only case where backup healing can be necessary.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
See, I keep hearing that this board is supposed to be flame free, but yet i see more &quot;stop being a moron&quot; posts from the regulars here than anyone else. Explain to me what is causing your group to take so much damage in ToV. Are they too low to resist the AE? Is their gear insufficient? Are they morons and standing out in the open? Explain it to me, because contrary to your belief, it is NOT SELF EXPLANATORY.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Again, the misconception that AE is the only cause of damage to non tanks is where your argument runs awry.  Perhaps you need to graduate from HOT raids and move into stuff where AE'ing wurms is the biggest concern.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
Wow, you suck at drawing analogies. I'm comparing YOUR HEAL to SHAMAN HEAL. Shamans do not get a direct heal. They get a heal over time. You get a direct heal, therefore you should not get a heal over time. Can you comprehend that, or is that still too vague for your simple mind?<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Shaman get spells like slow, which allow for massive damage prevention, which, when combined with spells like torpor, allow a shaman to help reduce damage taken while at the same time heal large amounts of damage for ridiculously small amounts of mana.  Torpor is an insanly good heal, which we have not asked for.  We've asked that NR be made into a useful spell.<br>
<br>
And your logic that because shaman get something and don't get something else, therefore druids should have the same problem is flawed.  This whole we don't get it, so neither should you is an argument style commonly used by 5 year olds.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
I see this is a main stumbling block for all people that can't see this. I shall attempt to explain this another way. Clerics are the healers of the game. They are all powerful. They alone have the most powerful spell in the game...complete heal. No other class shall get this spell. After that, their 2 main heals are Elixir, and Divine Light...both of which are BETTER than the counterparts of the other priest classes...which are Torpor and Natures Touch. This is the way it should be. Clerics should ALWAYS be better healers than druids, and shamans for that matter. By increasing Natures Touch, you in essence, become a BETTER HEALER THAN A CLERIC in situations where CH is not necessary...which seems to be what you're bitching about. I don't understand why you people draw comparisons to fully buffed 7k hp tanks and how well you can heal them WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR GODDAMNED JOB TO DO SO. The druid is not asked to heal the MT on a raid....so what is your issue here?<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We do not wish to heal the MT, we wish to heal the other people on the raid, In order to function in this job, we need a heal that will actually work for this job.  In Kunark days, Sup heal was barely adequate, then we got chloroblast.  This is not really adequate for velious encounters.  As mob damage has gone up, our heals have not kept up.  Infact, Divine light has not really kept up either, but this is the druid board, not the cleric board, so you hear about NT rather than DL.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
So, if it can't be snared, a druid usually wouldn't be soloing it right? And if you're in a group, having it snared isn't as big of a deal, right? So, again, where is the problem here? Please, ask your local necromancer how he feels about his epic. Any epic enabled necro loves it to death...he doesn't whine about the 1 mob in each zone that can't be snared, he avoids the mob. Take a hint. You're not supposed to be 100% effective against all mobs in the game. How does a necro feel against trakanon? <br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Alright, since you obviously don't have a druid, allow me to explain this to you.  We would like to be able to use our epic.  However we are unable to.  Do not use the WEAK, FEEBLEMINDED argument that necros love their epic.  The necro epic is a joke as well, but again, this is the druid board.  Instead of comparing the druid epic to the worst epic ingame, why not compare it to another priest.  Druids are, after all, a priest.  Cleric epic = ress, saves entire raids, possibly powerful to the point of broken.  Shaman epic = manafree, splurt type dot that does roughly 2k damage in under a minute.  Druid epic = highly resisted effect, which coupled with snare is unusable on a large portion of velious encounters, which does a meager 500 damage a minute, for 3 minutes.<br>
<br>
Clear enough for you?<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
You have asked to be better than everyone. You have asked to be a better healer, which I demonstrated above, the shaman community came here and kicked your ass for asking to be the best at DOT's, and you want ports in luclin, which wizards don't even have. A jack of all trades is one who can do all things ADEQUATELY and, i'm sorry if you yourself can not, but I know many druids that can, and do, on a daily basis.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Somewhere this makes a logical jump that I didn't see.  Where did we ask to be a better healer than a cleric? I don't remember seeing that.  I remember asking to be a better healer than a paladin, which I think maybe since they wear plate also, you got the two confused?<br>
<br>
We didn't ask for the best dots either, check out sciroccos analysis of the dots, if you are even able to read.<br>
<br>
The luclin port thing is something that we've asked for, to be brought into line with wizards, as they have nexus teleports.  I realize these are only usable on the moon, but I think that verant really needs to learn from past mistakes (markars/tishans relocation, wind of the north/south).<br>

My warrior has died before because my shaman couldn't keep up with damage output with just chloroblast. Druid could have with Natures Touch.

See how many of them are still using Chloroblast because their heal wasn't a vendor spell at 60.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Alright, Torpor drops from juggernauts, dragons in kunark, as well as VP mobs.  And if you think your 'warrior could have been saved with natures touch', you're mistaken, Natures touch is the exact same ratio as chloroblast.  Actually if you really do the math, chloroblast is minutely more efficient.<br>

I respect your attempt to make a cohesive, coherent argument, but not only do you jump rashly to conclusions, you fail to be objective.  Your miracle stories of piddling around in seb do not equate to the endgame.  Do you HONESTLY think that this entire petition signed by over a thousand druids is completely wrong, and you, a wise necro are the only one who can see the truth?

    Wow.  It seems that we finally have the poster here who is the epitomy of anti-Druidism.  This person, Vaxx, goes to extreme lengths in an attempt to discredit every argument brought up in the SotD; ideas that have been widely supported and fine tuned for weeks and months.<br>
<br>
    Vaxx would assume that he has more expertise in an area he probably has never delved in, other than second-hand.  Would I go to a Cleric board to vehemently argue down such new spells as Mark of Karn, or a Shaman group SoW with +atk buff that doesn't give wolf form?  Would I post an entire essay on how Mages shouldn't get an upgrade to their desperately underpowered class by using weak cliches and stereotypes in my rebuttals to their requests?  No.<br>
 <br>
    The only reason behind such an abhorrent fool as Vaxx is self-promotion.  He is the person who wouldn't spare a cookie from a full bag to a starving hobo.  He is the one who wants everyone to depend on him and need him, and his only medium for accomplishing this goal is through Everquest.  <br>
<br>
   People.  You can't argue with a person such as Vaxx.  If what he really desires is too maintain his weak ego through this game... let him.<br>

Didn't see this here, but I'd like the snare-effect removed from the epic. Virtually everything I've tried to 'epic' that is immune to changes in runspeed resists the druid epic altogether. Remove the snare effect and drop the dot to 1 min instead of 2. <br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Allow the druid epic to be able to snare mobs that are otherwise unable to be snared. If druids with epics could snare mobs that can't be snared/rooted by anyone else we'd have more of a usage in high-end groups.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upadainfain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Padain Fain</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 6:51:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=238>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> There's a lot of small comments I'd like to add to start with. I'm sure they've been said before in this thread but...<br>
<br>
1. This petition is NOT about anyone under level 55. Yes, there are certain considerations to be examined if any changes are made that affect Druids overall rather than a specific tweak. This in itself is NOT an argument against the petition.<br>
<br>
2. Arguments like &quot;...but how many &lt;class&gt;'s have &lt;spell&gt;?&quot; are irrelevant. The petition is objectively based on a classes abilities not individuals' spellbooks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some nitpicking of a previous post:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm sorry, are you asking to form a Nature's Touch rotation on raids? No? Then wtf is your main problem in comprehending this issue?

<br>
I take it then that your clerics never heal people in ToV if they feel they were at fault to get hurt? Your argument is circumventing the issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Wow, you suck at drawing analogies. I'm comparing YOUR HEAL to SHAMAN HEAL. Shamans do not get a direct heal. They get a heal over time. You get a direct heal, therefore you should not get a heal over time. Can you comprehend that, or is that still too vague for your simple mind?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Indeed compare like with like and the level 60 healing ability of Shamans and Druids is so far out of alignment. <br>
Torpor gives 1200 HP for 200 Mana in 24 seconds with some unpleasant side-affects.<br>
Nature's Recovery gives 900HP for 250 Mana in 3 Minutes (with no side-affects).<br>
<br>
Being slowed and snared for 24 seconds has never caused me a problem or caused Tanks around me problems. It is a brief irritation but allows the spell to be a little more powerful in its healing than otherwise it could be. <br>
To balance that I would feel it would be fair to reduce the time over which Nature's Recovery takes effect. I feel personally that lowering it to 24 seconds make its rather too much like Torpor and would prefer to see it as 1 minute, but that's me.<br>
<br>
Of course Druid's get Nature's Touch at 60 too, which gives 978 HP for 400 Mana instantly (well 5.5 seconds casting). Compare this to Chloroblast at 428 Hp for 175 Mana in 3 seconds, or Superior Heal (which by 60 is 9 levels old), 583 for 250 mana in 4.5 seconds.  <br>
I cannot for the life of me understand why Nature's Touch is such a bad spell. You can cast chloroblast twice in about the same time for more efficient healing (and importantly land the first heal in less time). I think that either NT must be made faster casting to offset its high cost and bad ratio or it must be made cheaper in mana or better in healing. Add in the sheer number of fizzles and the picture just gets worse. I've always felt that CB was a great heal, being so fast and efficient even if it is not too big. NT should be our upgrade to SH, our big, long casting heal. SH has a ratio of 2.33 hps per mana so around 3 would be about where I see NT, so keeping it at 400 mana it should heal somewhere in the 1200 range. Alternatively it could drop to 4 seconds casting, 900 HPs, 300 mana but I prefer the former as a solution.<br>
<br>
If you see, merely removing our healing penalty will actually make Nature's Touch seem even worse in comparison to the other heals even though it brings it up to 1100, it has the same magnitude of effect on the other spells. NT=1085/400, CB=475/175 and SH=648/250.<br>
<br>
Just to rationalise further... a cleric's healing:<br>
Level 51, Remedy, 438/175, 3 seconds. (c.f. Chloroblast)<br>
Level 53, Divine Light, 910/250, 4.5 seconds. (c.f. Nature's Touch)<br>
Level 57, Celestial Elixir, 1000/300 in 24 seconds, with beneficial side effects. (c.f. Torpor)<br>
<br>
...and of course Clerics have Complete Heal, which I will not include as it is their speciality and should have no analogy.<br>
<br>
So the current spells show that:<br>
A 55 Druid can heal like a 51 Cleric, excepting CH, for about the same mana. Sounds reasonable to me.<br>
A 60 Druid can heal like a 53 Cleric, excepting CH, but for 1.6 times the mana. The gap has grown... if you needed a healer for a group of 60s would you take a 53 cleric with no complete heal and a 60% mana penalty? <br>
A 60 Shaman can heal like a 57 Cleric who's missing Divine Light, excepting CH. A 60 Druid can do something similar but for a LOT more mana and much more slowly.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I didn't mean to labour that so much. My point? If two druids or two shamans or one of each is supposed to be able to fulfill the role of a Cleric in healing a group then the two classes should have comparable and balanced healing abilities. VI has stated this intent many times but the figures clearly show an imbalance. Clerics can keep their 3.5:1 or so ratio on heals (from level 51!) AND their &quot;gawd_knows_how_Many:1&quot; ratio on CH and, maybe, even get 5 or 10% more, while we get a ratio of around 3:1 at 60. Seems fair to me.<br>
<br>
No one here is asking for Druid's to receive 2 second casting, instant recast, 1600 pt heals for 200 mana.<br>
<br>
<br>

You have asked to be better than everyone.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Quite incorrect. We have not asked to be better healers than Clerics or EVEN Shamans, as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have shown above.<br>
No one has asked to be best at dots either. We have asked for an upgrade over our last dot, which is at level 53. I don't see any other class who get's their last spell in what is their most potent spell-line at 53. We know the price Necro's and Shaman pay for their vast selection of dots - DDs at the start and possible resists, although I have to say that argument is a bit pathetic when there are so many different dots for Necro's that they can find one or more for almost any mob that isn't completely MR. <br>
<br>
From level 53, when we get that last dot, we have 4 dot lines (plus epic if you have it) that stack. <br>
Winged Death : Magic Based, great DoT. 1287/350 in 54 seconds. <br>
Breath of Ro : Fire Based, with debuffs resisted quite a lot. 920/250 in 60 seconds.<br>
Drifting Death : Lower level Magic Based, reasonable DoT, but often replaced by even lower Drones of Doom as it is a right-click on lots of armor items.<br>
Immolate : Low level Fire Based and debuffs, resisted a lot.<br>
<br>
At 56 Shaman get a 1500+150 48 second DoT for 425 mana.<br>
At 59 Shaman get a 2000+90 108 second DoT for 430 mana.<br>
At 60 Shaman get a 1778+177 42 second DoT for 425 mana.<br>
<br>
As I noted, the Drifting Death line is not really a candidate for an upgrade as it would nullify the effect on ES Arms and the Velious Quest armor bracers. Immolate is not really a line of spells, just a one off, as is Breath of Ro. Plus both of them are heavily resisted and to have to load a debuff to cast before them makes them less efficient (and who loads 4 dots and debuffs anyway?). My suggestion would be an upgrade to Winged Death at around level 58. Something at about 1600-1700 damage for 400 mana over the same 54 seconds. This would be the sort of upgrade that is in line with everyone else and would not add an extra line of dots, nor would it be more powerful than Shaman or Necro dots.<br>
<br>

Once again, no. See above.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
Again, see above. &quot;Two druids or shaman should be able to fulfill the role of a cleric.&quot; We can't. I don't think Shaman can either but this is a Druid petition.<br>
<br>
As for porting around Luclin. Personally I don't want to see that, for any class. I like the relative paucity of ports on Kunark, Velious to some extent and Luclin. A good druid is great in the outdoors. Get out there and learn your way around, then you can lead those city dwellers to their destinations!<br>
<br>
As you might be able to see from what I've said, I actually think the petition goes to far. <br>
- 880 group heal for 900 mana is a 6:1 ratio and even for a group spell I think that is too much. At 600 for 900 mana it comes down to 4:1 which would be more reasonable, if a group heal were ever to be considered.<br>
- I think 1950 is too high for the upgrade to Winged Death - it is too near what necros and shaman can do.<br>
- I think 24 seconds is too short for the Nature's Recovery spell. You might as well just ask for Torpor.<br>
- I do not want to see Luclin ports. Learn your way around and be good enough not to have to evac - or if you do just succor.<br>
<br>
So, I've signed the petition because it raises the correct issues. The fact that the suggestions are beyond what I would find reasonable is probably a good thing. If VI were to consider some changes, they will probably only meet us half way anyway.<br>
<br>
Hugs to all the Druids and I hope this is readable and comprehendable!<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I am replying here to both the over all request, and to a few notes that have been made by people as I read through the replies.  12 pages is alot so if some of this has been said and I missed or skimmed over it I apologize.  I also apologize for paraprhasing rather than posting those neat little &quot;soandso saids&quot; with the little black bars above and below, but chat type functions are way above my head <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
I would first like to begin by saying that I am a level 59 Cleric and I play on the Rallos Zek server (being in a pvp environment may skew some things as unless we are deep people tend to wear only no-drop gear).  I have played on occasion on friends accounts, most often a 59 druid and a 58 SK so I have experience with both druids, and a little bit melees (but the sk spell icons confuse the heck out of me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). <br>
<br>
Anyway.. in response to the post (I had to read up on a few spells so sorry if I am not fully familiar).<br>
<br>
1)  Natures Recovery:  appears to heal for slightly more than Celestial Healing 900 vs 750 for 25 more mana.  Takes 2 minutes and 36 seconds longer to effect.  I would agree with reducing the effect time a bit, but I am leery of switching too much else.  Comparing it to torpor is a bit sketchy;  Torpor hits the target with a snare, a slow, and a mana sink.  300 more hp for 50 less mana, and a serious reduction in combat skills.  This one really confuses me, cause alot of people seem to be really focused on the refresh time but, while I have no refresh on the Celestial line, the only time I have cast two in a row is durring CR or down time... usually they get cast every 30 or so seconds (I'm bad with timers).  If it takes 3 minutes for the spell to take effect, shouldn't you only start to worry if it has a 174 second refresh?  On a side note does NR stack with the Celestial line?  Just curious for my own enlightenment.<br>
<br>
2)  Group heal  880hp for 900 mana.  Ok, first things first on this:  New class getting group heal.  This doesn't strike me as being anything to special because there are rare times when a group heal is useful, AE mobs seem to be the most common time, and it would be nice to have someone else keep the rest of my group alive when something nukes and I am 2 seconds into a CH on the main tank.  However; the mana to hp ratio on this is all wrong.  I get a 660hp for 750 mana at 52, a 750 for 900 at 57 (whee it casts cure disease and poison - sorry that's limited in its use), and 1100 for complete heal at 60.  That last one sounds nice, but it takes 12 seconds to cast, which (imo - sorry haven't made it to NTOV yet but I have been around the block) makes it really only viable for healing in the aftermath of a CR or a nasty pull.<br>
<br>
3)  Larger direct heal.  I have no problems with this, with one condition.... I want one too.  I can't keep up with mobs much better than you can.  If something wants to eat my enchanter for lunch it is going to, and all I can do is chain remedy to slow it down.  Divine light would be a good spell, but 4.5 seconds is a really long time, and it's only real use is healing non-melees, who don't last very long against end game mobs, or even basic stuff in places like Kael arena.  The two big differences between Remedy and Chloroblast are the fact that Remedy has a MUCH larger range (appropriate imo) and that clerics specialize by and large, in alteration... otherwise your argument is really to get something for druids (secondary healers) something that clerics (primary healers) don't have.<br>
<br>
4)  PotG self buff.  I agree 100%.  You should get a single target version of this, personally I think it's absurd that you didn't.  However, comparing it to Blessed Armor is inappropriate.  The stats are basically the same and the mana regen is the same, but you can cast it on someone else, which makes it apples and oranges IMO.  The other thing to consider is that BAotR is (at the moment) a MUCH rarer spell than PotG, and will be for a while.  On a side note bringing the 55? wolf form into this for mana regen is silly, because most raids occur indoors ergo no Wolf form.<br>
<br>
5)  Ageo and PotG not overwriting.  I'm iffy on this one, I feel that if you get a single target things shouldn't change, but if not I can see that being fair.  I have yet to (and won't for a long time) experience Blessing of Ageolisim, so I can't speak from experience, but I know how it hurts to watch mana and Peridots get eaten.<br>
<br>
6)  Changing the Epic.  This one I'm not going to comment much on, other than to say that I do feel that the Druid epic is one of the easier ones, and that; as a class that has none, I think right clicky damage is awesome.<br>
<br>
7)  Changing dots.  This one is a bit out of my league, but having played a shaman to 45 (un-twinked) I have to say, there is a really big difference between the shaman buffs that DD and the druid buffs that don't... be careful what you ask for.<br>
<br>
Eight (grr emoticons)   Luclin ports.  I believe that the idea here was that this was something amazing and unnatural (read:  stuff that druids don't like) that a bunch of wizards got to gether and figured out.  While I have no problem with the later introduction of spells to help druids move people around luclin,   a)  don't ask for them until the moon is fully explored.   b)  the moon really isn't that big... you can get from any zone to another in little time with Jboots or Sow/SoE/whatever the name of that new shaman SoW is.  Ah, a p.s. of sorts, if you are arguing from an Evac standpoint, use Succor!!!  Every wizard and druid that I know does.<br>
<br>
And on to the responses....<br>
<br>
&quot;Even clerics can solo well in the grey.&quot;  umm... well sorta I guess.  I can burn a full mana bar, and hope I don't get more than a resist or two.  The AA exp really messed alot of things up, not the least of which is the fact that in some zones tanks can do alone what used to take 2 or 3 people.  Bet you just about anything an AA'd melee would rather have a druid over a cleric as a partner, but we were discussing druids as a viable raid member or so I thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn, we need more druids.&quot;  True, doesn't get said alot, but I will also argue that rather than &quot;Damn, we need more slowers,&quot; the usual comment is &quot;Damn, we need *A* slower.&quot;  Yeah, to raid you need a tank and if you are doing something serious you probably need a warrior, and a 60 one at that.  Yeah you need Clerics or the warrior will die.  Yeah you probably need a chanter, suppose you could do stuff without one, but it would take alot longer.  You bias your question tho.. how often do you hear &quot;we need more Paladins, Shadowknights, Wizards, Beastlords, Necros&quot;  Some classes lose efficiency due to there being too many at a given raid, and due to the game mechanics, druids aren't the only ones (shouldn't they look at fixing the others too then?).<br>
<br>
&quot;Looking for Druid to fill a slot&quot; (and later, with a group of 5, passing on a druid).  This one is really skewed.  Sure there are times we don't want a druid, there are times we don't want a paladin, shadowknight, warrior, mage, necro, etc...  Yeah, if my group is say, me, a warrior, a monk, a rogue and a wizard I'd rather not have a druid.. I also don't want anyone else who isn't a bard, enchanter or shaman.  Wanna know how many times I zone in, do a /who and know before I /ooc &quot;Cleric LFG&quot; that I won't get one cause I can see the zone has too many clerics?  2 druids do ok in a group; 2 clerics waste mana.  Adding to this one again as I read.  I'll be honest my reasonably ideal group looks something like this:  Me, 57+ Warrior, Mage w/ Myst Rod, 60 Rogue, 56+ Enchanter, 56+ Monk (or a Shaman or Bard in place of the mage or monk).  Nowhere in there do you see Druid, nor do you see a paladin, shadowknight, ranger, wizard, necromancer, or beastlord.  The reality is, the ideal rarely happens and only fools hold out for it.. you make do with what you get.  Nine times of ten a pally or a SK is my main tank, why?  Because I know them, and they play their class well - they take hits and keep aggro.. sure not quite as good as a warrior, but good none the less...<br>
<br>
&quot;Druid buffs suck.&quot;  Well, to a tank I suppose, but me, I'd rather have PotG and then symbol, and so would most of the casting classes I know..  That combo give me about 200 less hp and 20 less AC.  IMO a fair trade for mana regen, especially since I won't see Blessing of Ageo for a while.<br>
I agree with Nos's post that druids are meant more to fill a lacking role than to BE a specific roll.. after all like bards you are supposed to be the Jack of All Trades, master of none, right?<br>
<br>
&quot;Druid heal's can't heal in a raid&quot;  True, neither can shamans, as someone mentioned your point would be much better if you argued it with them (and even clerics) for priest classes instead of just for yourselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Druid complete heal.&quot;  Ok this one makes me wince outright... but in keeping with the concept of furthering a balanced game, what about shamen?  I don't know that I like the idea of a CH for other priests, but perhaps a partial ch.. heals for half the missing HP perhaps;  Incomplete Heal?  Regardless I would be strongly against this being anything less than 59-60, and it should never be more than half as efficient as a cleric's.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing Penalty for others and bonus for clerics.&quot;  I didn't know about this one, and it confuses me that they would set a standard that noone uses.  If there is a -10 and a +5 I say ditch the -10 and the fact that 99.9% of clerics specialize in Alteration will still keep things fair.<br>
<br>
&quot;Complete Heal breaking the game&quot;  I suppose  (sorry talkin bout one of my best heals sets me off).. it might be better to say that Complete Heal makes the End Game the way it is... at 44 was amazing, but it didn't &quot;break&quot; the game.  I doubt the spell will be removed, because then everything from Kunark on would probably have to be re-tooled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aggro on healing&quot;  This one I am honestly curious about.. is it really, a case of: you heal ExtraMelee_02 and get beat down by the mob?  Are you healing the primary melee early?  Are you sitting?  I don't mean for any of this to sound snide in any way, but after 5 seconds of taunt I can Celestial Elixir the MA and sit, and ~15 seconds later I can CH and sit.  Are druids (and shamen?) really seeing that much aggro from comparatively minor heals?<br>
<br>
&quot;Changing the epic snare to be able to deal with velious and luclin mobs&quot;  I discussed the epic thing earlier, but again (esp because I lack right click damage, this one annoys me).  I will also try to promise that this is the only time that I whine about the ability of druids to solo.  As I said at the start, I have watched and played a 59 druid.  I have seen her spend hours on end clearing the Coterie in Madiens in hopes of the mr/wis earring that drops there, and heard her say, &quot;as long as it doesn't summon, I bet I can kill it&quot; for arguement's sake I will tack on &quot;And isn't immune to changes in run speed&quot;  Sorry, if you can take down alone a 50+ mob that a standard group (seen coterie proc the life tap?) has a bit of trouble with you're going to have a hard time convincing me that you need something fixed that works in that arena.<br>
<br>
&quot;Never said clerics shouldn't get an upgrade to divine light&quot;  well true, but as far as I saw you never said we should...<br>
<br>
&quot;Most of our AE spells &lt;only work outdoors&gt;&quot;  this one only really matters if you are doing an AE group, and having done many an ae group with druids I don't really feel that you have anything to worry about here.  Ah; modified statement, I will presume that you meant non Point Blank AEs (ie the ones that you have to target the mob for and use for quadding) but again the question arises, why?  Most enchanters would ban you for life for using an AE spell, and indoor zones by definition seem rather poor for quadding.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lure based DD's&quot;  This one I could back.. Druids are definately the &quot;nukers&quot; of the priest class, I don't see a reason they shouldn't get a scaled down set of lures.  At the same time tho, it does seem unfair to me that shaman get stuck with a rather iffy set of mainly ice based DDs.<br>
<br>
&quot;SoE vs DMF&quot; umm SoE please.. I lev, I run faster, and I see invis; vs I lev I see invis and I have alot of poison resists, which is really really limited in its use.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shamen and necro's regenning mana&quot;  Don't get me started, if you are gonna fight for better regen I will too.. I'll trade my epic for Sacrifice off Yelniak in a heartbeat (well, maybe not a heartbeat, the Skyfire Ragefire camp is one of the most ridiculous ideas in EQ).<br>
<br>
&quot;Focus of Spirit spell&quot;  this one encounters a lot of problems and finds its roots in the base cleric/druid spells.. clerics get better buffs first.  When I was going through 30-50 I loved it when I was in the low digits (my druid friend and I were always close level wise) because my buffs were better than hers.  Cleric and druid hp/ac buffs have never stacked.. Cleric/druid and shaman buffs has.  It would take some convincing (especially on VI's part) for you to reason why you should get to add an extra 400hp to a tank when you never had been able to before.<br>
<br>
&quot;druids using evac spells&quot;  Dunno what kind of people everyone is grouping with but I have yet to be in a group with a wizard or druid who doesnt have the Safe Point spell mem'd and is rarely afraid to cast it.  I'd hate to hear the explanation when a cleric or tank calls evac and the druid/wiz says umm, didn't have it mem'd sorry...<br>
<br>
&quot;Insane possibilites &lt;Slow, Torpor, cann&gt;&quot;  True druids have none of these.. neither do clerics.  Why should you get them and not me?<br>
<br>
&quot;Druids are asking to be fixed in &lt;REALLY high end situations&gt; only &lt;NToV, Vindi, etc&gt;&quot;  I'll give you ground on the concept that that is why you started the petition; but the reality is, changing the class changes the class...  it's really hard to tweak you to be a &quot;make or break&quot; class in raids and not have it effect the game play.  And, not to beat a dead horse, why do you deserve to get that status, I bet necros have you beat on the end game issues.....Oh, oh.. revised since the person I am replying on this to went so far as to say &quot;if you are not rebutting... petition.. examples... relating to this &lt;end game&gt; particular mode of play, *YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF THE ENERGY SINCE YOUR REBUTTAL SIMPLY DOESN'T APPLY AND THEREFORE DOESN'T MATTER*&quot;  Riiiight....  you can make all these magical changes and the only thing it has an effect on are raids.. what, cast a heal and if there aren't 60 ppl in the zone it won't go off????  sorry, the doesn't matter thing pissed me off.  It is absurd to think that you can change the &quot;End Game&quot; without thinking it will effect the general high level play.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you looked at the buffing and healing abilities of clerics lately&quot;  Lets look at this... Buffs:  Cleric, Kunark:  Heroism (good), Heroic Bond (still use at 59), Symbol of Marzin (good for main tank, but sucks the Peridots - Druid buffs take reagents?), Naltron's Mark (Great spell), Bulwark (pre ageo this is a must have), Ageis (worthless);  Velious:  Ageolism (exceptional and simple for the important tanks); Luclin:  Blessing of Ageo (amazing spell, and amazingly rare), Marzin's Mark (never met someone with this).  Druid, Kunark:  Circle of Winter/Summer (really good for resists, esp on a pvp server), Regrowth (good regen), Girdle of Karana (+str is good), Nature Skin (better than Herosim), two group damage shields, regrowth of the grove (amazing group regen); Velious:  Protection of the Glades (been over this one already);  Luclin:  Spirit of the Eagle (amazing - but travel not combat based), Circle of the Seasons (yeah it replaces SoW/S but cleric buffs go obsolete too).  <br>
  Now lets go into heals:  Clerics, Kunark:  Remedy (good for kunark, patch heal after - great range), Divine light (again good for kunark, but too slow to be reliable in Vel/luc), Celestial Elixir (this is truly an amazing spell).  Velious:  Celestial Healing (nice filler till I hit 59). Luclin:  Blessing of Ageolism (Really good spell in that it lessens mana cost and Perdiot loss, but not by much).  Druids:  Kunark:  Superior Healing (good at the time but gets outdated in a mana/hp/cast time ratio I believe),  Chloroblast (equals remedy except in range), Natures Recovery (slow Celestial line), Nature's Touch (slightly less mana efficient than Divine Light).<br>
  So, from a heal base, we don't seem IMO to be that far off, and aside from a single target PotG, I think our buffs are fairly consistent as well....<br>
<br>
&quot;Gimped Druids&quot;  How does a CotH mage effect travel?  Do they stand at every zone line and offer to summon you for nothing?  Every mage I know hates having to summon someone who isn't coming in behind on a raid or truly lost in a confusing zone.  And.. if we wanna talk CotH, shouldn't you throw mages a bone as they get replaced by nercros using summon corpse, since most of luclin doesn't let you use Call???  You are arguing single (and by definition I assume pickup) groups, which I take to mean groups that take 6 people who fit a mold well, and go kill stuff.  Sure it's not ideal, but only a moron holds the group back because they don't have the perfect combo.. heck I've been in OS with 3 mages a necro and an enchanter, does that sound like an ideal group?  p.s.  it takes (best case) 15 minutes to port up to the moon and down again, and that assumes that you got to the nexus 20 seconds before it zapped you up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Druid heals post 50 = 2.2 hp/mana&quot;  Remedy is 2.7 hp per mana, Divine light is 2.6, so we didn't go up either (and no, group heals don't count).<br>
<br>
Anyway... I am sorry and it got late, I made it halfway through page 7.  The common consensus seems to be that Druids (and as a frighteningly few people pointed out Shamen) need to be reavamped when it comes to heals considering endgame.  Thats all fine and well, but please don't argue for it whithout considering that Clerics need the revamp as well...<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Ok, I disagree with wanting to be a shriveled cleric as a druid.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have 3 different approaches to adjusting our class to make them better without taking away from the other classes...<br>
<br>
Make our skin buffs MORE POWERFUL than cleric buffs.<br>
<br>
Changes might be:<br>
<br>
Level   Spell              AC       HP        Regen   Mana   Dur<br>
1         SLW               4         30                             27m<br>
14       SLR                8        100                             27m<br>
24       SLS               12       160           2                36m<br>
34       SLD               16       220           2         1      54m<br>
44       SLN               20       250           2         2     1h 12m<br>
52       NatureSkin      24       400           4         2     1h 24m<br>
60       PoTG             28       750           6         6      2h 30m<br>
<br>
This breakdown...  We exceed cleric &quot;straight&quot; buffs at all points.  With regen and mana regen, we would offer superior BUFFING -- allowing us to contribute in a better fashion.<br>
<br>
Aegolism could be used but, if you went with our spells, clerics could then tack on their Symbols and AC spells ontop of our base spells, providing overall better protection and some regen -- not massive, but good enough to make them worth stacking.<br>
<br>
Just adjust the spell levels as shown to provide these levels of protection.<br>
<br>
Not a second string cleric.  A buff person with fire and cold plus HP and AC.<br>
<br>
As for epic, add a step to the process to change the proc.  Set proc to DOT and Ro's Smoldering debuff combined.  <br>
<br>
This would make it a very effective and desirable tool without unbalancing anything.  The DOT does damage still while the debuff adds to it's use in group situations.  Keeping it both along the lines we currently have for spells and letting us offer even more in groups with melee debuffing.<br>
<br>
IMHO these suggestions beat the hell out of &quot;gimme more wimpy healing abilities&quot; and &quot;just dump the snare from our epic&quot;.<br>
<br>
No other class changes and we end up with better offerings for groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udangrim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dangrim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/9/02 7:33:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=241>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fear the clerics</span><hr size=1> A lenen with co, let me try to put this in VERY simple words.<br>
<br>
You asked for a better direct heal above natures touch (880 vs clerics 960). I can also qoute a number of druids who posted lines like &quot;Try to heal a 7k tank and see how much it does&quot;. Now, if you try to heal a tank with 7k hp who is NOT tanking then you should have NO issues at all. He takes as example 2k in riposte (why he is so stupid to take them in the first place we can argue but he got them anyway). That is (as you already stuck regen on him right?) ~3 Natures touch on him for 1200m in ~21 sec. Would a CH cost less mana? Yup. Does that render druids usless? Nope. Does that mean a druid cant heal as good as a Cleric? Yup.<br>
<br>
Now, let me try to put this to you again, you are NOT suppose to be healing the all the MTs damage (but you do a damn nice job as patch healing as secondary healer), some druids relize that some dont (or we would not have people asking for healing for a 7k tank).  You are not suppose to be healing the rampage tanks constantly either. You are not suppose to alone replace a cleric (even though druids do that today in exp groups). You are suppose to heal riposte damage (which people at this level should learn to reduce to close to nothing with positioning), potential AoE damage (which in many cases is avoidable or easy to counteract with group regen depending on if we talk NToV or Ssra) and similar damage.You want to talk about Burrower, AoW etc? How many people are there exactly taking damage on those encounters for you that you need to heal up huge amounts of damage? And also ask yourself, if you had the cleric heals (960 vs 880 80pt more 1 sec faster heal) and CH (10500 4.5 sec longer casting time) how would you exactly make someone survive that overaggroed? Are you seriously trying to tell me that one cleric can keep someone who aggroed and tanking up long enough for the MT to get aggro again? Because you are saying you cant and I would say, well neither can a cleric so what is the deal? Or are you saying that your tanks/casters are constantly taking damage from burrower rampage/riposte and you need to heal them? Because if they do take such constant damage then I really wonder what they are doing (and a hint would then be to go to the ranger board and learn about aggro management)...<br>
<br>
You see, here is the problem I got, the group heal suggested is a joke. It is simply to good but do something like 25% of buffed hp for 900m or so that is enough to keep up with AoE damage (and dont affect a regular exp group as a sidenote). Some complained they get AoE damage, that is funny as I had druids hold a group of melee standing ALONE with problems but it is doable. Give him a paladin, the benefit of AoE mana song, and they will do great. Also you can tell your random tank to please step out of the AoE range if he takes to much damage so you cant keep up. Slightly less DPS but cost more mana to rebuff him if he dies and he can bind wound if nothing else and charge back in. Is it perfect? Nope but it is sure doable. Perhaps level up the raid or get better resists if you cant do it. But that is a sidenote anyhow.<br>
<br>
If you want big direct heals then I got to ask what are you going to give up for it? As you want to go over the line of what clerics been doing best (big direct heals) to do it better then clerics. Clerics dont get snare, invis, track, dots etc. We do get the best heals ingame though. Also you people keep saying this is to fix the raiding end game. Well here comes a wake up call, what ever &quot;fix&quot; you suggest affects BOTH exping and end level raiding. Druids are easily replacing clerics these days in exp groups. You dont have to heal someone for 7k only because he has 7k hp, you only have to heal as much as he takes in damage, that is a important difference. And the bigger heals a druids get the more he steps in on the clerics healing territory. And before I get to hear someone say well you dont know high end level raiding, AoW kill, clearing of NToV, Ssra Creator and Arch etc. Yes, I am there, Yes I got druids there and Yes, they do contribute. <br>
<br>
The once who wrote up this petition also seem to lack the following:<br>
1. Actually read what other classes got and the exact effect of it (The dot is a good example)<br>
2. Remember that yes raiding at the end game is fun but a class do pay for abilities through out the whole carrier. That means having it easy early levels can mean beeing less wanted at higher levels.<br>
3. Trying to secure a wide base for it by suggesting something that dont make a class god like...<br>
<br>
<br>
There are issues I agree, but look at that list, compare what would happend if you got it all. Compare what you got and what other classes got, you aint exactly in a bad shape. As for all the druids posting they agree, from what I see so is only 10% even 60... You should perhaps clean out your own house of the people who are not high end raiding and posted before complaining over other coming here and posting that aint high end raiding.<br>
