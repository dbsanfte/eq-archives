Tiny bits of paper and cotton floated about the arena in a display of celebration and hightened anxiety. Broken ale cups littered the Arena floor, along with discarded hats and other assorted articles of clothing - even undergarments.<br>
<br>
Today was no ordinary Arena match, but it was the ten year anniversary of the Arena's first blood match. Every year, towns and villages sent thier best fighters to bloody themselves in the pits. Every year, only one person won. Losers who were lucky enough to live walked away without thier weapons and armor, and with no pride. <br>
This was the match to find out the bravest warrior, the strongest champion, the most blood thirsty fighter. <br>
<br>
It was the Fight of the Nine Hells. In the first preliminary rounds, each warrior was tested by a master Armsman to see his or her skill with a weapon. A creature of equivalent size and ferocity was chosen as thier opponent, and the fight began. If they won, they were added to the list of competetors. If they lost, they became food.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our story takes place with the young barbarian warrioress, Tilana. She had grown up with her eleven brothers in Halas, who taught her nothing more than brotherly love. It was this &quot;love&quot; that turned her into the fiercest female of Halas, quickly outclassing most male warriors in her training. At her 18th winter, she was pronounced Halas' forthcoming champion, and was to enter this year's tournament to honor the people of the Everfrost Peaks.<br>
The journey was long and boring, and rather uncomfortable, coming from the frozen lands of the Everfrost to the warm climate of the Karana's, to finally the Arena in Lake Rathtear.<br>
Sitting lazily in her tent with her was her long time friend, a young wood elf. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stop that, it's making me irritated,&quot; Tilana barked. Cringing her nose to the shrieking sounds of a large axe being sharpened on a grinding millstone, she turned her head so that the pillow covered her ears. <br>
&quot;As dull as you keep your weapons, I'm surprised you could cut a brick of butter. Look at this axe. It's rusted beyond repair! How do you expect to win if you don't have a sharp weapon? Everyone will laugh you know.&quot; The elf continued to pump the petal with her foot, making the millstone spin faster as sparks flew into the corner of the tent until the axe had a nice silvery sharp edge to it. &quot;There, you should be able to cut that tangled mass of hair on your head with this.&quot; <br>
&quot;Ya better be careful with that wit of yers, or yer hair might be the one I'm cuttin.&quot; Tilana rose to her feet, relieved of the noises for a little while. Seeing her friend reach for a pair of short swords, she decided not to stick around to listen to that, and promptly stepped outside to get some fresh air.<br>
The arena was littered with hundreds, if not thousands, of tents, wagons, mules and horses, and people.. everywhere. The first rounds of the Arena duels were almost over. She was still tired from her first fight with the Kodiak bear. It wasn't too fierce, she thought to herself, the armsmaster underestimated my skill. <br>
Walking from tent to tent, she sized up her future opponents. Many of them were humans of much smaller stature and size to her. Even a few tiny elves, and she let a small chuckle reside within her massive chest as a gnome put together his gear and weapons for his next fight. It'd be a sad day in hell for that gnome should he get ta fight me..<br>
The cold metal touching her breast reminded her of the pendant she wore. As always, she used to kiss the pendant for when she needed luck, but since two winters ago, the person who's picture resided in the pendant died. She has never let the pendant far from her heart since then, and the metal has never warmed itself even when it touched her skin. It had always remained as cold as the ice from her homelands.<br>
<br>
A bullhorn sounded the beginning of the second round. All the warriors - nearly 30 of them - staggered out of thier tents and headed towards the pits. Her friend ran up to her, faithfully carrying her choice weapon - a massive two handed battleaxe - and the two shortswords as a backup weapon. Tilana reached down and took the axe with one hand, swung it in an arc at her side for good measure, then slipped the shortswords in thier belt loops, and headed into the Arena.<br>
<br>
The announcer was calling out the names of the gladiators, and slowly throughout the rest of the day the matches began and ended. Most warriors were merciful, but some gave in to the chants of the crowd and slew thier opponents in a bloody cloud of glory and applause. It was Tilana's turn to fight.<br>
<br>
Her footsteps rumbled the steel platforms as she stomped down into the pit. Clouds of sand erupted at her feet as she walked to her side of the ring, and with one fluid motion released her hellish axe and readied it to cut apart anything that came close to her. The crowd cheered at the giant woman, and she replied only with a snarl that would make a werewolf run away with it's tail between it's legs.<br>
A slender woman emerged from the crowd and stepped into the ring, wearing nothing but a blue silken robe and weilding a staff as long as she was tall. Her ears were somewhat round, but had under-defined points that an elf would have. The face was round and fleshy, much like a human, but her hips were barely existant, much the same as an elf's hips were.<br>
Damn halfbreeds, they think they are the best of both worlds, Tilana muttered as she bared her teeth to the druid.<br>
BEGIN! shouted the announcer. Instantly the druid dropped her staff onto the ground and flung her hands straight out, opening her palms. Orange waves of fire flowed down her arms and into a growing fireball, and launched it straight at Tilana. The ball of fire arced towards Tilana's attempt to dodge it, and the blast struck the wall just behind her, showing her with magical sparks and flames. Tilana rolled to her knees and with one hand holding her axe, she reached into a pouch with her other and grabbed a hold of a dozen or so tiny sharp objects. With her strength she threw the caltrops all over the floor of the arena. Should the druid resort to range fighting, she would have to be wary of both Tilana and the little sharp mines littering the floor now. One false footstep and they would easily pierce the druid's leather boots, allowing a few seconds for Tilana to close in for the kill.<br>
In the second she took to close the bag and improve her stance, the druid was preparing another spell. This time the green aura surrounding Tilana's legs was the telltale mark of most warrior's end. A fraction of a second later tiny vines burst out of the sand and wrapped themselves around Tilana's feet and calves, immobolizing the warrior. The vines were so strong that Tilana's steel legplates whined and creaked as they gripped harder.<br>
Quickly Tilana dropped her axe and unsheathed one of her short swords  and began cutting away at the intrusive plants, and within a few seconds she was free. The druid, preparing a long, deadly spell of fire, stood motionless, hoping to finish the spell before Tilana began her charge.<br>
It was too late. Tilana sprang up from her feet and snatched up her axe, holding it low for a powerful upward strike when she got within range. Several caltrops were crushed into the ground by her steel boots, and her yell was louder than the announcer's amplified voice. The druid cancelled her spell, and quickly began casting another spell that would immobolize Tilana. Again, the druid had made her mistake. Tilana's axe was brought up with a whoosh of air and the loud, audible rip of a dress. The axe tore straight up through the groin and out the right side of the druid's torso. Bits of blood and bone flew into the cheering crowd as the one legged half-torso of the druid hit the ground in a bloody heap. Her heart still pushed fresh blood out of the chest cavity, and Tilana raised her red axe up high, announcing her victory with a blood flecked smile.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
That night, as Tilana lay resting on her pillowy bed, the arena area was silent as the mountain ranges. Only the sounds of the nearby lake's waves licking over the rocks was heard. That, and the breathing sleep of her friend. She looked over her friend, a tiny wood elf she had known since her early days of adventuring. Werane, as her name was known to her, was a skillful rogue. The pair had spent many weeks in Qeynos together, pilfering money from the more wealthier nobles and spending the money on candy and other enjoyables. They were an almost comical couple, but no two people could have enjoyed each other's company as they did.<br>
Bah, she thought, this ain't no time fer inner reflections. I need to git some sleep.. I'm not gonna do so well tomorrow if I don't. Tilana rolled over on her side and clenched the pendant in her fist as she lulled herself off to sleep.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
The next day was the same as before, with the crowdes fattening themselves with snacks cooked by merchants, the contestants (those that were still alive and not grieviously wounded) readied themselves for the third event.<br>
It was a paired match, where it took teamwork to be the victor. Tilana hated working with someone she didn't know. But this event was far easier than the others to follow, so it would be best to make allies in this match as soon as she could, and it would have to start here.<br>
<br>
Two by two, each of the remaining contestants was paired up, and entered the ring with devastating results - just the way the crowd liked it. One poor human was used as a club by his ogre &quot;partner&quot; to finish off thier last foe, and had he lived through being a living battering ram, he would have advanced to the fourth round with his partner. Tilana smiled as she watched the ogre.<br>
Unfortunately, she was paired up with some chatty fellow who she never would have thought was a contestant here. Aparently, he was from a village outside of Freeport, and hailed as a bard. He only wore a light blue tunic and breeches, almost less protection than the druid she fought earlier. She didn't get to see his fight, or how he won, but she was sure it had something to do with under the table business, so maybe she was safe. Or maybe he was just lucky and fought someone more rediculous than he.<br>
<br>
It was thier turn. She groaned and staggered into the arena, her shins still aching from the druid's Root spell. Her bard bounced along behind her happily, almost stupified that this was a fight. A real fight. And possibly to the death.<br>
Her shoulders sagged as she saw her two opponents. They were both Tier'Dal. One was a man of the dark art of necromancy hailing from Neriak itself. The other was a female Knight of Innoruuk, coming from the outskirts of Neriak.<br>
&quot;Alright.. dis ain't gonna be easy fer us, so ya gotta chin up and follow mah lead, else ya gonna git it in the gut. Ya understand?&quot; she spoke, hoping to land a clue to the witless bard. He merely grinned and narrowed his eyes, then turned to face thier enemies.<br>
At the announcers' call, the fight began. The shadowknight immediately began a full run towards both of them, while the necromancer began casting a spell. Light folded around his body and began to pulse with darkness, and soon Tilana felt her heart began to slow down to a deadly pace. Her energy completely left her body, and soon was too weak to even hold her axe, much less stand with it. She dropped to her knees, and began to struggle just to breath. Her vision darkened to a blur, and it was a losing battle she fought just to stay consious.<br>
The female began to close in on them, and Tilana turned her head to see what her companion was doing. Singing!? she nearly screamed in her mind. The blasted fool is singing?! The anger she felt as being forced with such a fool enraged her so much she began to recover some of her strength. Drawing out her two lighter shortswords, she stood up.. and saw the female charging the other way. <br>
&quot;What the blazes are ye doin, fool?!&quot; she shouted, but the bard continued to smile and uphold his hands on high as he sung even louder. The crowd laughed and cheered as the female knight charged the doomed necromancer, and when she got close finished him off in a single, powerful blast of dark energy. <br>
&quot;Now it shall be YOUR turn, my dear lady of the frost.&quot; He reached into the back of his cloak and drew out a small hand drum, and began to beat out some annoying song. It irritated Tilana, but she noticed what he was doing. She had heard of a bard's magic, but had never seen one use it before. She never believed it to be true until now. Her muscles were tight under her armor, enlarged by the magical effects of his song. Soon he added another chorus to the melody, and she found herself charging at the shadowknight with blinding speed. <br>
The shadowknight blinked her eyes and saw that the bard made a fool of her, making her kill her own teamate, but when she turned around to see the maddened warrior charging her, she knew she had a bigger problem - literally - to deal with first.<br>
The two clashed weapons fiercly. Tilana's weapon skill was by far greater than the 5 foot tall dark elf's, but even still, the dark elf managed to parry most blows that would have ended her life. Her weapon of choice was a spear that mounted a large ornamental bladed head instead of the standard sharpened point. She carried a shield with her, but even with this defensive configuration, Tilana managed to get in a few well placed cuts along the underarms of the shadowknight and eventually wore her down through fatigue. With the bard's magic, she was unstoppable. Never fatiguing, stronger than she was normally, and fast as a hawk after it's prey. <br>
&quot;H.. hail. I hail!&quot; the elf stammered out, with both tips of Tilana's blades a mere inch from her eyes. The crowd jeered at Tilana to finish her off, and just when Tilana raised her foot to smash the head of the elf she felt a strong grip on her arm. <br>
It was the bard.<br>
&quot;No, let her live. We've already won! Let us drink and sing! Trust me my lady, all will be well.&quot; he said with a smile that would make an orc blush.<br>
<br>
