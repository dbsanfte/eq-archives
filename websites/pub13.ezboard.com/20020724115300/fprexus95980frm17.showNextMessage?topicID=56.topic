Dark Age of Camelot <br>
Version 1.33 Release Notes <br>
October 25, 2001 <br>
============================================= <br>
<br>
NEW THINGS AND BUG FIXES <br>
======================== <br>
- /ignore is now in the game, which allows you to cut off all communication with a player who is bothering you. Use &quot;/ignore&quot; by itself to see a list of characters that you are ignoring. Use &quot;/ignore &lt;playername&gt;&quot; to add a player to the list, or to remove that player from your ignore list if he is currently being ignored by you. Please note that ignore lists are based on your character, not on your account, so you can have different ignore lists for all your different characters. One of your characters can have up to 20 players ignored at once. <br>
- The /AFK command has been added. This sends a message to anyone that tries a direct send to the player that they are away from the keyboard. It also flags you on the &quot;who&quot; list as being &lt;AFK&gt;. <br>
- The /FRIEND command has been changed such that it works across regions (you can add and remove friends across regions/cities/dungeons). <br>
- Firbolg sitting and casting animations have been tweaked so their arms and hands don't stick through their shields. <br>
- When enchanting an item at a NPC enchanter, you now get a confirmation dialog box with the amount it will cost. <br>
- In order to alleviate the extremely long times to level between levels 40 to 50, we've added a &quot;level step&quot; at the halfway point for each of these 10 levels. At this &quot;level step&quot; the player will gain extra skill points (1/2 the normal amount for his level) to raise skills, will have his death &quot;floor experience&quot; reset to the halfway point, and will have his &quot;low exp death&quot; for the level reset. <br>
- We've made some fixes to the /STUCK command. It should work far better when you get stuck in a wall or stuck falling through a geometry. <br>
- We've fixed the autoreply feature when using the /ADVICE command. When replying to an incoming ADVICE message, you'll automatically reply on the ADVICE channel. <br>
- The /ADVICE command now presents the user with a popup window listing up to 25 available advisors (it used to scroll by in the chat buffer). <br>
- When a player uses the APPEAL command, they now get a popup dialog asking if they really want to appeal. The dialog tries to direct them to use the /STUCK command if they are stuck or the /ADVICE command if they wish game advice. <br>
- When a spell is resisted, a mage only loses 1/2 power. <br>
- When killed on horseback, your corpse should no longer be stuck to the horse. <br>
- Continued bandwidth reductions on various messages. <br>
<br>
WORLD NOTES <br>
=========== <br>
Albion Quests: <br>
- Players stuck on the Slythcur Cloak quest in Albion can right-click on Anga Weaver to recover and continue their quest. <br>
- A new level 30 Albion quest added <br>
<br>
Hibernia Quests: <br>
- Players having trouble with the Way of Magic, Learn the Paths quest in Hibernia: Some changes have been made to journal entries for step 2 to clarify matters. Re-read your journal entry for hopefully better instructions. <br>
- Another tailoring merchant, Darcy, has been added to Tir na Nog in Hibernia near the other tailoring merchant, Saffa, due to the large amount of players swarming the one merchant. This should alleviate that problem somewhat. <br>
<br>
Midgard Quests: <br>
- A Level 21 Midgard quest for Hunters, Shamans, Thanes and Skalds is up on Pendragon for testing. <br>

SPELL SYSTEM NOTES <br>
================== <br>
Please note that some of these fixes have already been deployed to the live servers. <br>
<br>
- Wizard, Sorcerer, Cabalist, Theurgist, Spiritmaster, Runemaster, Eldritch, Mentalist, and Enchanter self AF buffs have been re-tuned to provide a smoother curve over the life of the character. Now, the lowest versions give slightly less benefit, but the higher level ones give substantially more armor factor bonus. <br>
- Changed a number of spell effects to upgrade and/or use the proper realm's graphical effects and animations. Please note that we continue to work on streamlining casting effects. <br>
- There was a bug where some types of &quot;debuffing&quot; spells were never resisted. This has been fixed. You will now notice that some of your debuff spells will be resisted just like any other spell. <br>
- Most resisted spells now only take half spell power, instead of the full cost. Please note that this does not apply to &quot;Bolt&quot; spells. <br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing unintentionally increased power costs for direct damage casters. <br>
<br>
Thane changes: <br>
- Lowered timer on Toothgrinder's Hoof to be 20 seconds, so you now can cast this spell more often. <br>
<br>
Skald changes: <br>
- Slightly increased damage on Warcry and Battle Whoop lines. <br>
<br>
Theurgist changes: <br>
- Due to the high power regeneration rate at lower levels, the power cost for the level 1 elemental summons has been increased. <br>
<br>
Spiritmaster/Enchanter changes: <br>
- Increased power cost of pet-only heals. <br>
<br>
Magician changes: <br>
- Aura of Turning line in the Way of the Moon list has had its power cost corrected. <br>
<br>
OBJECT NOTES <br>
============ <br>
- The Vendo Caves are now itemized. Item levels 22-33. <br>
- Midgard Warrior Guild track quest items for 20 and 25 have been flagged as Warrior only. <br>
- Jewel of Dark beauty backstab changed to critical strike. <br>
- Hollow Breastplate in Albion now has stat bonuses. <br>
- Silvered staff in Hibernia should now work properly. <br>
- Ceremonial cloak in Hibernia is now wearable and takes Emblems. <br>
- Hunter's Broadsword in Albion now uses the Slashing Skill. <br>
- Mantle of Insight in Albion should now be able to be equipped. <br>
- Belt of Misdirection in Hibernia should now be able to be equipped. <br>
- Skeletal minions in Hibernia should no longer drop Roman items. They will now drop Realm-appropriate loot. <br>
<br>
ADVICE SYSTEM <br>
============= <br>
- If you want to help your realm-mates with common questions that they may have, try becoming an Advisor! The Advisor System is set up so that players with more than 15 hours of played time can choose to help others in their realm. Simply type /Advisor, and you will be flagged so that others know you are willing to help. Then, when players use the /advice command, their questions will be routed to you, and all other experienced players who have flagged themselves as Advisors. <br>

But its true hehe the tailoring merchant and the forge are known in Camelot as the &quot;clusterfvcks&quot;. Least in DAoC you can walk right through people. in EQ you would be jumping all over the place just to target the merchant after getting a new consignment.<br>
<br>
And the guards are WAY over worked. Their union is demanding they may only give directions once every minute. Guards are often turning and pointing so fast they are a danger to themselves and others running by and getting clotheslined by an insane twisting and turning guard throwing his arm at you.<br>
<br>
but THANK god in DAoC multiple people can use the forge. Otherwise a calendar would have to be brought in, We would have to get Koi's ass over there, He would stand at the forge 24/7 and direct people to it. Those who used the forge out of line would be sanctioned! And you would be cast out of Albion fromt he snowdonian fortress gates to live in the frontiers with the headhunters and Midguardians for the rest of your days in your exilement. <p><center><img src="http://www.unityeq.org/images/krozar/daoc3.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaraxistreestalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Araxis Treestalker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/26/01 5:46:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch Notes 10/25</span><hr size=1> HAHAHAHHAHAHA Krozar <p>Araxis Treestalker<BR>

<br>
Best thing to do would be to do the same.<br>
<br>
My suggestion was to place all the 6+ merchants in one/both frontier fortresses with full facilites. Allow the 6+ items to be sold back with a smaller, but still significant, loss.<br>
<br>
This would let people go to a specific place to find the high quality craftings and still force those wishing to consign to 650 to travel. (cant task past 650 currently)<br>
<br>
There are other towns, in Hibernia atleast, that have forge facilities but no merchants. Making those active would help as well.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.showPrevMessage?topicID=58.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.showNextMessage?topicID=58.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="prexus95980general">General<option value="prexus95980trading">Trading<option value="prexus95980frm15">Guild Leader Forum<option value="prexus95980guildrecruiting">Guild Recruiting<option value="prexus95980rants">Rants and Flames<option value="prexus95980frm13">Spell Trading<option value="prexus95980raids">Dragons/Planes/Raids<option value="prexus95980frm16">Anarchy Online<option value="prexus95980frm12">The Epic Quests<option value="prexus95980roleplaying">Test Forum<option value="prexus95980frm17">Dark Age of Camelot<option value="prexus95980frm18">Upcoming Events<option value="prexus95980frm19">The Hall of Fame<option value="prexus95980frm20">Fallen Friends<option value="prexus95980frm21">The Retirement Home<option value="prexus95980frm22">Neverwinter Nights</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980>Prexus</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980frm17>Dark Age of Camelot</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
