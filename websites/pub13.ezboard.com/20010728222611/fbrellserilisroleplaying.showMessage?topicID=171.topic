The snows would come early this turn and would probably cover the Qeynos Hills so heavily that none would venture forth from Surefall before spring.  The time was perfect.  By the time he was missed by his teachers the snows would have them blocked in, unable to track him down and return him to the unbearable life he had known these past eight turns.<br>
<br>
        He knew his chances for survival were slim.  He had discussed them with the only person in all of Surefall he could trust.....&quot;El, you can’t go like this&quot; Wyndwisper had said.  &quot;The snows will fall soon, and this promises to be the worst winter in fifty turns.  Your training is not yet complete, how can you survive without all of the knowledge every ranger needs to stay alive in the Norrathian wilderness?&quot; <br>
<br>
       &quot;You were my mothers closest, perhaps her only, friend in this glade&quot; he responded.  &quot;Between us we share many secrets.  One of which could turn the life of someone, far to young to understand, into the same kind of hell mine has been.  Every day that I remain here the danger of that secret becoming public grows and I won’t let her face what I have endured all these years.  I would rather die in the hills, free of the bigotry and hate I have always known, than live in this place a day longer than necessary&quot;.<br>
<br>
        He knew she was right, that this was a dangerous move, but he had taken all of the ridicule, teasing, fear, and even outright hatred of the folk of the glade for far too long.  Their fear that his blood was tainted by the evil his father had worshiped was what fueled their fear and hate the most.  Elmoran was born the son of  a Tier’Dal shadow knight that had wed a renegade Erudite wizard.  He had known only love from his parents, and he had never seen them perform an evil act towards any of the glade folk.  Indeed, he remembered, they had always gone out of their way to help any who needed it.  <br>
<br>
       His parents had wandered Norrath together, in search of a way to unify the races and religions, for many years before finally coming to Surefall.  He often wondered what they had found in their travels that could have changed their lives so much. He remembers hearing them speak of their search for something called geomancy  often before they were killed.  Perhaps some day he would complete their search.  Their writings were safely hidden so that none could disturb them.<br>
<br>
        Elmoran stands now where he had stood eight turns before, the site of his parents funeral pyre.  He remembers that day as if it were yesterday.  The Darkpaw gnoll clan, led by Trannix Darkpaw, and their allies, the bandits of the Karana Plains, were raiding the hills and outskirts of Qeynos.  These raids threatened the security of Surefall, so it was decided to send a force out to stop them.  He remembers his father preparing for battle and swearing that he would not call upon the dark powers he once believed in, for he had turned from evil long ago.  His mother, after many years of study and hardship, had mastered the druidic arts, so she too would go forth and do battle to protect Surefall.  They never returned.<br>
<br>
        A lad of only eight springs, he stood near the blazing pyre upon which lay the bodies of his mother and father.  The few who had gathered laughed when Elmoran vowed to bathe in Darkpaw blood.  But wait.  Suddenly he realizes that this funeral is different from the others.  It is held outside of Surefall, not at the traditional pyre site.  And where were the ash gatherers?  &quot;Master Sureshot&quot; he asked &quot;why are not my parents being placed with the others who died in the battle?&quot;  There was a long silence before he was told that only the true folk of the glade could have there ashes stored in the Mammoth Caves.  &quot;But my parents ARE folk of the glade, they  lived and fought here for years before I was born.  Am I then not one of the true folk?&quot;  He never received an answer.<br>
<br>
        He fights to hold back the tears and control the hate within him.  Why would they go out and die to defend people who hated them?  The same people who for years have hated and mistreated their son?  At least his sister would never know that hatred.....&quot;You and I are the only ones who know that Satheena is not your daughter by birth&quot;  he said to Wyndwisper.  &quot;I can now understand what I could not at the time my mother brought her to you, and I can leave with the knowledge that she will not suffer as I have&quot;.<br>
<br>
        His mother and Wynwisper had become close friends after Danira had decided to give up wizardry and learn the druidic way.  One fateful day they had given birth within hours of each other.  Unfortunately Wynwisper’s child died shortly after.  Danira’s second child to Sathar T’Ndrkalir had none of the Tier’Dal or Erudite features which had marked Elmoran.  This child looked more like the half-elf children of the other glade folk.  She saw a chance to save this child from the anguish which had followed her son.  Since none knew of her pregnancy, or would have cared, it was easy to let folk think that this girl child was the true daughter of Wyndwisper.  She knew that the child would be raised in an atmosphere of love and trust that would have been impossible if her true parentage were known.  As a sign of the honor and respect that Wyndwisper held for Sathar and Danira, she insisted that the child be named for her true father.<br>
<br>
        &quot;She is safe for now&quot; thought Elmoran.  He swore that the time would come when the truth would be told and he would claim Satheena as his sister, and a true member of the T’Ndrkalir clan.  Although he wondered if his fathers people, or his mothers for that matter, would accept them.  He vowed to someday seek them out and proudly proclaim his and Satheena’s ancestry.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Bah, this gets me nowhere&quot; he screamed at the howling wind.  So, pulling his cloak tighter about him, he turned into the already swirling snow.  He had seen signs of gnolls nearby and felt in need of a bath.<br>
