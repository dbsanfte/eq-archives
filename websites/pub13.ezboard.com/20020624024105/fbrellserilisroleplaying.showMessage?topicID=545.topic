The tail of Orkko Orkko, the Ogre<br>
<br>
<br>
It begins to rain.  A loud burst of thunder booms through the skies above Norrath; as the odd couple of an Ogre and a Dwarf run to seek shelter in the tunnel of commons. <br>
Though sitting alone behind the crates, shunned from the rest of the crowd, they were very happy.  The two had become used to being alone, Ooborta had left her city of Oggok quite some time ago, to explore the world.  She loved her people, they were family, but she didn’t like a lot of there culture.  Growing up, she wasn’t like her family, most likely the only Ogre vegetarian to ever exist.  She just couldn’t understand why they all ate other races, and hung up the leftovers like trophies.  It disgusted her, though she knew it had been that way for centuries, so she never said a word, and kept to herself most of the time.  She left her family at the beginning of her fourteenth season as a shaman, promising them a safe return someday.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She had a long way ahead of her, and many dangers as well.  Knowing only the Feerrott and the Innothule Swamp, where she had grown up, she really hadn’t encountered that many other races.  She grew up with the Trolls, and had met the occasional Dark Elf, bashed a few Frogloks, and other than the roaming animals in the swamp, she really hadn’t met that many other races.  As a child, she had been warned of a Human bard that lived in the swamp, but she had retained the pleasure of not meeting him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After reaching the commonlands, with virtually no help from fellow travelers, Ooborta met a wonderfully nice High Elven wizard, by the name of Diath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hello hun, can I help you with anything?”  Diath asked her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hullo!”  Ooborta said, enthused that someone had spoke to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Giving Ooborta a confused look, Diath asked, “Where is it that you are trying to get to?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ooborta left home, big long journey, me want to meet little people!”  She exclaimed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmm, you mean the Dwarves and the Gnomes?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “YAH!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Again, giving Ooborta a confused look, “Now, I don’t want to be rude, but, well, the Dwarves and the Gnomes, they don’t take to kindly to the likes of Ogres.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yah, me know, but Ooborta will bash wutever it take to make dem like me!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, if you would like, I could give you a port to Grater Faydark, I am on my way home now, and the wizard spires aren’t that far from Clan Crushbone,” Diath told her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Uh, wut in Clan Crushbone?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Orcs.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Orcs?”  Ooborta asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The Orcs are the enemy of the Dwarves, Clan Crushbone is home to the Orcs, that is where you will find a lot of Dwarves hunting, by killing Orcs, you will gain faction with the Dwarves, no so sure about the Gnomes though.  It will take you awhile, but I’m sure that one day, the Dwarves will like you.”  Diath explained.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yah, me do dat, me go bash Orcs, den Dorfs like me!”  Ooborta cheered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok, off to Grater Faydark with us then.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp LOADING, PLEASE WAIT…<br>
Ooborta had entered the Grater Faydark.  Diath guided her to Clan Crushbone, cast a few spells on her, so that she would be more than ready for combat, waved goodbye, and then gated away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once inside of Clan Crushbone, two Orc Centurions, and an Orc Legionnaire attacked her.  She was able to defeat the two Centurions, but the Legionnaire was tearing her apart, her spells going interrupted, and her stamina dropping, she wouldn’t have lasted much longer.  Then to her aid came a small Dwarven warrior, named Wellington.  He tore into that Legionnaire like no other, saving Ooborta.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, tink yew Wellington!”  Ooborta shouted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Bah, twas nothin’ at all,” he said to her.  “So, what brings big Ogre all the way out here anyways?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wull, me come to bash Orcs, make Dorfs like me!”  She responded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Beaming her a smile, Wellington said, “I like ye already M’lady.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the odd couple had been together since that night in Clan Crushbone.  Ooborta bashed a lot of Orcs, though not enough to be welcome in Kaladim, Wellington’s home city.  Not even at his side, was she allowed to enter the gates.  Wellington himself was now no longer welcome in his home city, for he chose and Ogre to be his bride.  They were together for many years, though had only been married for seven.  The two of them bad befriended Suzze, a young Gnome cleric, who welcomed them into the guild Exile.  They hadn’t been welcomed into a family since they had left their own.  Ooborta and Wellington were married by Suzze not to long after that.  And then, she became pregnant, with her first, and only child.  Which brings us back to the present day, in the tunnel of commons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tis ok my love, ye shall be alright.”  Wellington reassured her, though not quite sure of himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Moaning and screaming, with the pains of childbirth, Ooborta couldn’t really speak much.  Her hand griped that of her husband’s, that alone gave her hope, though it wasn’t enough.  “Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!,  GET IT OUT!!!!”  She exclaimed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bubar, a merchant whom set up shop in back of the tunnel, was the only one that would help them.  He had never done this before, but he had seen many births, and knew more than Wellington did.  So Wellington gave him his trust, knowing that there were no guarantees, and hoped for the best.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After two and half hours, a baby boy was born, and Ooborta had not lived to see her son.  Bubar helped Wellington on his journey to the Feerrott, to bury his beloved.  She was at home, and at peace.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank ye friend Bubar, I wish you good travels.”  Welling said to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye, I only wish it hadn’t ended this way.  I wish the best for you Wellington.”  Bubar replied as he turned to head home.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ooborta had told him of her promise to return home, and he know that it had never happened, she was afraid of what her family would think.  Oggok, he thought, not a place for a Dwarf.  He headed down the trail toward the city, and then remembered that he still had the potion of invisibility that his wife had given him, and he wanted to make sure that he and the baby made it to Oggok alive.  Using the potion on himself and the baby, he said aloud, “Ya know kid, you need a name,” thinking for a moment, he remembered his wife’s maiden name, “Orkko, ya, that’s what we’ll call ye, Orkko, I like that.”  So down the trail Wellington and his son Orkko went.  “It’s time ye met yer grandparents, heh, and I met me in-laws.”  He said, looking down in his arms at his son, laughing aloud.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After entering Oggok, he dropped the invis, and was almost immediately confronted by an Ogre bouncer, “Hey, me usually kill dorf on sight, but me want know why yew has Ogre child.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tis me son,” Wellington stated with pride.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “BAH! Yew culdn’t has Ogre child, yew dorf!” The bouncer shouted.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmm, might ye remember an Ogre woman named Ooborta?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yup, she go away dough, long time ago, how yew know her?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “She was by wife,” he again stated with pride.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bouncer stepped back, looking at the Dwarf, “Was?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lowering his head, and shedding a tear, Wellington told the bouncer, “Aye, she died giving birth to Orkko.  She had told me of her promise to come back here one day, and she never made it.  So here I am, yer food, the Orkko’s family.  I’ve come to show them their grandson.  Will ye let me pass?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hmm, dat guud question, me take yew to Ooborta’s muder, she decide, come,” the bouncer instructed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wellington followed, carrying Orkko to the Orkko’s home.  “Wut dis?  Has yew brought me food?”  Oolanga, Ooborta’s mother asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bouncer stayed, while Wellington retold his story to Oolanga, and Ooborta’s father, Braptom.  Oolanga, taking her grandchild in her arms, motioned for the bouncer to remove the Dwarf, taking him to a jail cell, until they decided what to do with him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wellington rotted in that cell, for four long years.  Orkko had known of his father, and that he had been held prisoner for as long has he could remember.  At night, he would sneak out to his father’s cell, to hear stories of his mother.  And even though he didn’t like that his father was held prisoner because he was a Dwarf, he was happy that they didn’t kill him long ago, before he could get to know him.  Though Orkko was an Ogre, and the only noticeable trait that he had gotten from his father was a tiny bit of facial hair, he was still outcasted from the others his age.  He had befriended Snaut, a Troll warrior he had met while bashing kobolds in the swamp.  Then came the day when Orkko entered his fourth season as a shaman, and for a celebration, his family had a big feast.  He was excited, and had hoped that his father could attend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Grandma, culd dad come to da feast?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, young Orkko, yer fader id coming to da feast.”  Oolanga said to her grandson with a smile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “He id!?!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yup, yer fader id da main course tonite.”  She said, as she turned and walked away.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Orkko stood for a moment in disbelief, then he ran off to go see his father one last time.  “Dad, me sorry dat dey gunna eat yew.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Tis ok son, I should have know that when I brought ye here.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Orkko gunna leave, me go see world, like mom did, me loves family, but not like dat dey eat yew.”  Orkko said to his father, trying not to cry.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then go son, and don’t forget me.  There is great danger out there, so be careful.”  Wellington reached thought the bars of the cell, and gave his big son hug, “I’ll miss  you Orkko.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Orkko met up with Snaut, who had also decided to leave his home to explore the world, the two set off to the commonlands, where they both hunted for a while, and gained knowledge of the world.  Orkko decided that he wanted to go to Clan Crushbone, like his mother, in hopes that he would one day be welcomed inside of the cities of the other races, and that maybe he’d meet a hotty little Dwarven lady.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thus ends my tale of Orkko Orkko, the Ogre.<br>
