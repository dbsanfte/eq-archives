We've all experienced the accidental &quot;run into the ex-girlfriend&quot; incident at one point or another, and unfortunately, most men are not prepared or remain clueless about how to act when confronted with such an intimidating experience: especially if it was a harsh breakup.<br>
Most men -- those that were dumped -- make the mistake of using this opportunity to show their ex-love how devastated they've become since the breakup. Even after months and sometimes years have passed, some men still behave in childish and jealous ways.<br>
<br>
In extreme cases, some men even demonstrate their hurt by displaying pouty faces and depressed body language. Why would some men act in such foolish ways?<br>
<br>
Their main reason for displaying this type of behavior is to establish sweet revenge by making her feel guilty as ever for having put him through such agony.<br>
<br>
&quot;thank god I dumped him&quot;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, things never go as some men plan. More often than not, most women are very harsh when judging their ex-boyfriends. Instead of feeling sorry or anywhere close to guilty, the first thought that will run through a woman's mind is, &quot;Thank God I dumped him.&quot;<br>
<br>
It is the woman's way of rationalizing that her decision to leave her ex-boyfriend was the right one. So if you have any thoughts about acting like the humble, noble, nice guy who got hurt for loving someone too much, forget about it. You will only make yourself look weak and reinforce her negative thoughts about you.<br>
<br>
The best way to behave around the ex-girlfriend is to simply be friendly without showing any emotional attachment or regret. Showing her what a success you've become and that there are no hard feelings about the breakup will give the impression that she was not your greatest loss.<br>
<br>
the sweetest revenge <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
Like most normal men, you still feel pretty bad because she jumped out of the relationship first. And even though it was probably the best thing that happened to you, you still feel a little resentful. The remedy for such bitterness is to have the sweetest revenge of all: become successful.<br>
<br>
That's right boys, if you've been dumped, instead of staying home feeling sorry for yourself, or letting your performance level take a downward fall, be it in school or at work, get out there and be that successful person you want to be.<br>
<br>
Get in shape<br>
It's time to shed that layer of fat around the gut. Don't waste any energy feeling sorry for yourself; join a gym and get back into shape. The fastest way to get over a loved one is to feel good about yourself, and there's no better way to do so than by attracting women with your body.<br>
<br>
Become a better person<br>
Having been dumped, this is the ideal time to further discover yourself. Use this time to do all the things you've never had time for. Travel to spiritual locations, do some volunteer work, spend time with your family, learn to ride a motorcycle, go mountain climbing, and discover a new hobby.<br>

<br>
Being bitter gets you nowhere, its hard not to be depressed some days, but if breaking up with someone you were with is the worst thing that ever happens to you, be thankful.  There are much worse things that you can experience.  Heh, although having said that, i've reacted badly to a breakup, worse then most will.  Maybe thats how i learnt what i now know.  It CAN take a while to become friends though, my first GF did some things to me that should make me have hated her more then any living being, but once i realised the reasons behind her actions, i felt sorry for her more then anything.  Then after 10 months, she realised her anger at certain things was misdirected towards me and we ended up sorting everything out.<br>
Staying friends can hurt alot to start with, especially when the other person moves on alot sooner then you.  My long-term ex found someone and was engaged/pregnant within 6 months of our breakup (i was with her 3.5 years or so) and it hurt, alot.  But she understood that it was hurting me, so alot of the time we spoke after she told me, she avoided talking about her upcoming wedding/fiance'.  Gradually i could handle hearing small parts and then eventually became close friends again and even the most personal detail didnt upset me.  But maybe its because my Gf's have been friends first and then had it turn into more that its easier to revert back to friends, i dont know.<br>
<br>
My take is to get back to living your life, Hitting the Gym is a good idea, although as i am finding out, a painful one.  After a year off of training, my muscles got used to being lazy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just try to stay as positive as possible.  Contacting old friends is also a good idea, friends help make things more bearable, without friends i dont know where i'd be today!  Although after what my friend has planned for me tonight, maybe i'll re-post on sat saying its NOT a good idea! HAHA!  <br>

I knew I would see her again.  In some ways she shaped me into who I am today.  We grew up together,  we lost our virginity together, we experienced &quot;love&quot; together.  I used to spend almost all of my part time money on her.  We were an item for 2 years.  She left me for a good friend whom I hated ever scince.  I knew she would be there.  I hadn't talked to her in 11 years at least.  She was so beautiful.<br>
<br>
Well, I went back.  She had gained about 75 lbs, popped out 2 kids, lived in a run down house by the lake.  My old friend dumped her to move to New York, and her now husband delivered my pizza.<br>

Most times, I feel like I don't want to have anything to do with her until I'm over her and can act normal around her again.<br>
<br>
I did have the recent pleasure of being over a girl before I broke up with her.  But that was more thanks to her than anything else.  She took a pair of scissors and went through my wardrobe, cutting up most of what she knew were my favorite clothes.  Then she threatened to put bruises on herself and call the police on me.  I was gone the very next day, and I haven't looked back.<br>

Clothes are just possesions, easily replaced, but the feelings you experienced while in the relationship will stay with you forever.  Maybe within seconds of destroying your gear, she regretted doing it.  Actions done in a moment of anger shouldnt erase all the love and feelings you experienced over the time you were with her.<br>
<br>
My ex called my from my now ex best friends bedroom, saying she had just slept with him and that she didnt want to see me again.  I was, lets just say, devasted and acted very stupidly.   I hated her, and thought i would never forgive her for the hurt she caused, but in time i did.  It took me YEARS to get over it, even after we became friends again, i still got upset about it every now and then.  As for my ex-best friend, i saw him with my next GF, it was rather funny to see him go redder then anybody i have ever seen when i said *Hey, this my new GF, sorry bro, but you cant have this one* (not exact words, but words to this effect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) My Ex and i had been together for a long time and had been friends for 3 years before that, so i was determined not to lose the good memories i had!<br>

I miss you<br>
And I wonder how you feel about me too<br>
Do you miss the way we would play<br>
And waste our time away?<br>
Suddenly, we're apart<br>
And I can't see you every night<br>
Though we'd fight I loved you so much<br>
Now I can't feel your touch<br>
<br>
Oh girlfriend<br>
That's the end<br>
And I'm lost without your love<br>
Oh love<br>
<br>
In your arms<br>
I was happy as a little boy could be<br>
Taking pills and mellowing out<br>
Now I just want to shout<br>
For your love<br>
'Cause I'm drifting further from you everyday<br>
Driving by your place every night<br>
I used to feel alright<br>
<br>
Oh girlfriend<br>
That's the end<br>
And I'm lost without your love<br>
Oh love<br>
<br>
Feeling fancies every night<br>
When I dreamed to be alright<br>
Oh love<br>
Oh love<br>
<br>
Oh girlfriend<br>
That's the end<br>
And I'm lost without your love<br>
Oh love<br>
<br>
In your arms<br>
I was happy as a little boy could be<br>
Taking pills and mellowing out<br>
Now I just want to shout<br>
<br>
-humming-<br>
Now I just want to shout<br>
-humming-<br>
Now I just want to shout<br>

Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror<br>
as I drive away<br>
wishing that I could take back all those words<br>
that meant nothing that I didn't say<br>
<br>
I'm trying<br>
to be what you want me to be<br>
but it's so damn hard to keep playing the part<br>
of the fool, week after week<br>
<br>
I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)<br>
you say you want someone to call your own<br>
open your eyes, you can suck in your pride<br>
you can live your life all on your own<br>
<br>
Is this all going to be just another time<br>
that we play this game?<br>
I've tried to convince you that things could be different<br>
but somehow they end up the same<br>
<br>
But what<br>
did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?<br>
you say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost<br>
well, I do too<br>
<br>
I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)<br>
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when<br>
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side<br>
I'll just jack off in my room until then<br>
<br>
It's never over 'til it's done<br>
and I don't think that you're the one<br>
it's never over 'til it's done<br>
and I don't think that you're the one<br>

scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep anymore<br>

You make it hard to breathe <br>
It's as if I'm suffocating <br>
And when you're next to me <br>
I can feel your heartbeat through my skin <br>
It makes me sad to think <br>
This all could be for nothing <br>
I wish there was a way <br>
For you to see inside of me <br>
I've never felt this way <br>
About anyone or anything <br>
Tell me <br>
What do I have to do to make you happy? <br>
What do I have to do to make you understand? <br>
What do I have to do to make you want me? <br>
And, if I can't make you want me <br>
What do I have to do? <br>

I know exactly what you're thinking <br>
But I swear this time I will not let you down <br>
I'm not as selfish as I used to be <br>
That was a part of me that never made me proud <br>
Right now I think I would try anything <br>
Anything at all to keep you satisfied <br>
God I hope you see what loving you would do to me <br>
All I want is one more chance, so tell me... <br>

I don't want to hurt you<br>
For no reason have I but fear<br>
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of<br>
But I'm guilty of fear<br>
I'm sorry to remind<br>
You but I'm scared of what we're creating<br>
This life ain't fair<br>
You don't get something for nothing, turn now<br>
Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br>
It could be sweet<br>
Like a long forgotten dream<br>
And we don't need them to cast the fate we have<br>
Love don't always shine thru<br>
Cos I don't wanna lose<br>
What we had last time your<br>

This life ain't fair<br>
You don't get something for nothing, turn now<br>
Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br>

But the thoughts we try to deny<br>
Take a toll upon our lives<br>
We struggle on in depths of pride<br>
Tangled up in single minds<br>
Cos I don't wanna lose<br>
What we had last time your<br>

This life ain't fair<br>
You don't get something for nothing, turn back<br>

I know I'll miss her later<br>
Wish I could bend my love to hate her<br>
Wish I could be her creator<br>
To twist her arms now<br>
<br>
She stares up at the stars when<br>
The stars fell from her hair then<br>
I bent down to collect them<br>
And then she was gone<br>
<br>
Oh, I sleep just to dream her<br>
I beg the night just to see her<br>
That my only love should be her<br>
Just to lie in her arms<br>
<br>
Oh, I came there to find out<br>
Find out she'd made up her mind, oh<br>
My arms are all tied up<br>
To me she was blind<br>
<br>
This space between us<br>
Where wingless dreams fall earless<br>
Will you not bear me witness<br>
With your back to me now<br>
<br>
It seemed so unnerving<br>
Still somehow deserving<br>
That she could hold my heart so tightly<br>
And still not see me here, oh<br>
<br>
Oh, I sleep just to dream her<br>
Beg the night just to see her<br>
That my only love should be her<br>
Just to lie in her arms<br>

Wish I could bend my love to hate her<br>
Wish I could be her creator<br>
To be the light in her eyes<br>
