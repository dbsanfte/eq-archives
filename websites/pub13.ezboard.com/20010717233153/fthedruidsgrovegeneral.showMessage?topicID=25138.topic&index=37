<br>
The zoning is FAST! It takes me like 3-5 seconds to get to the next zone. In EQ, it takes me upwards of 20-30 seconds. Everyone playing the game (everywhere in the world) can talk to one another in /tell or through the various channels they have that are built in. The game also buffers /tell message, so if you are online when someone sends you a /tell, the message will stay in the system until you log on and then all of your buffered tells will show up when you log in. There are zones…but they are referred to as dimensions. On missions, you will be the only one in your dimension unless you make a copy of a missions key to have people jion you in that dimension. That is rather nice as nothing can be camped or KS'd from you. Loot is totally random.<br>
<br>
The game is unparalleled in the graphics department. I have yet to see non-online games look this good. The world is simply gorgeous. Comparing the environment to EQ would be like EQ being a comic book and AO being a virtual reality dream world. The characters all have different looks. There are over 20 different faces for each race and gender. (There are 4 breeds and, ummm…2 genders, except for Atrox which can only be male. Hehe.) You can choose your height and your build. You can be short, medium, or tall...slender, medium, or chubby. <br>
<br>
It is hard to control at first if you have been playing EQ for a while. There are two 3rd-person views and there is a first person view. I have always used a first person view in EQ, so this works best for me. Currently there is a problem with one of the third-person views, which will be fixed soon. <br>
<br>
The graphics user interface is the best I have ever seen for ANY game. It is well detailed and easy to navigate. EQ could only wish for a GUI this good. <br>
<br>
Money is in only one form – credits. They weigh nothing and you don’t have to worry about putting them in the bank. I am not sure how this will be affected in PvP, but currently you do not lose your credits when you are killed.<br>
<br>
You can Alt-Tab and go to the Windows desktop. At the moment the game will crash if left in this mode for more than a few seconds.<br>
<br>
I ran in one direction for 15 minutes and on the world map I could barely tell I moved. The world is enormous. They have vehicles (ground and air) that are in the game that you can acquire...though nobody has that much cash right now.<br>
<br>
Getting into the game is VERY fast. I have timed it 3 times now. From the time I clicked on the AO icon on my desktop until I saw my character in the game and was playing took no longer than 30 seconds. It takes me up to 3 minutes to even see a character screen in EQ. =/ <br>
<br>
It has a local area auto-map feature and built in GPS. You can use loc and find where you want to go with the map coordinates. Not all maps aer pre-loaded into your charcter's map section. YOu can buy maps from various general stores. There is also a world map built in that places a cursor on it as an indication of where you are in the world.<br>
<br>
You don’t have to worry about food and water…though you can buy stuff to eat for the sake of novelty.<br>
<br>
Dieing makes you go back to your last save spot at an insurance terminal. It costs 30 credits to save your characters (chump change). In return for this insurance, all your gear is returned to you in the return terminal in 1 minute. You won’t be asking for a rez, because there is none. You do lose exp after, I believe it is, level 5 or 6. You lose all of your exp for that level that you have gained, but you will never lose a level due to death. For instance you could have 4000 out of 6000 exp before you reach the next level. If you die, you will lose somethign like 3985 exp. If you were to die again, you would lose none as you would already be at the beginning of the current level. While this sounds harsh, the exp it takes to get to the next level is NOTHING like EQ's. You can see exactly how much exp you get per kill and exactly how much exp you need before ht enext level. And, there are no hell levels. =)<br>
<br>
The cities are large. I spend most of my time in a city called Tir. There is a major problem with lag in the city because so many people are in there getting missions. This is a result of the debug mode they aer currently in. You can reduce the inner city lag by reducing your visibility distance down to 50%. Kinda like taking the clipping plane down to 50%. Outside and in the missions, the game is flawless in my experience.<br>
<br>
You can do missions to get money and phat loot. You can really focus on what kind of mission you want, whether it is easy or hard…geared more towards money or exp…stealth or straight up combat…etc., etc. Missions are done solo…or you can make a copy of your mission key and have buddies help you. When you complete your task, you get an item, money and exp. You can either avoid mobs by sneaking around or kill them and get money and exp. In the beginning the mission dungeons are pretty much the same. As you get higher in level, they vary. No two dungeons are exactly the same with the placement of mobs or chests that contain items. You find chests in most missions that can give you more loot, though a few may be empty.<br>
<br>
Buying gear in AO is VERY VERY hard right now….even harder than it was in EQ when it first came out. A nano program can run you 40000 credits. I am level 8 as of now and my missions rarely get me 2000 credits for completing them. You really have to rely on others who aren’t using programs, weapons, armor, or other pieces you may need to help your class along...or try to find it as one of the rewards you get from doing a mission. You can find an item that you would have to pay 20000 for, but it only sells for 10 credits or so when you sell to a vendor. I think one of the hardest things in the game will be finding ways to make cash to buy expensive stuff…that ranges upwards of 200000 credits. I don't know how the money situation will be when the game actually begins on the 27th. I kinda like this high cost stuff because it creates money sinks which is something EQ really failed in. Earning lots of money at higher levels is not hard. Rewards are relative and commensurate to your level. Say, at elvel one you get 92 exp and 5 credits for killing a mob. At level 8 you get 218 exp and 30 credits for killing a mob...adn so on.<br>
<br>
The commands in AO are VERY similar to EQ’s. You have /tell, /shout, /group, /petition, etc., etc. The emotes are AWESOME! There are a good 40 emotes and some are very complex. They have one called /pulp that does the Pulp Fiction dance in its entirety. You can /moon people with very realistic movements, though no buns are shown. You can blow someone a kiss…or do various other dance moves. And, yes, there are dance clubs in AO that you can show off your moves. Hehe<br>
<br>
The game is very skill based. Everyone in the game has the same skills, but depending on your breed and profession, you will build them faster or slower than others. Say if you are a monstrous Atrox Enforcer, your ability to build your strength and melee skill will be easy, whereas it would be hard to do for a Nano Meta-Physicist. There are about three times as many slots to put items on your character than there is for EQ characters. When you look at your gear, there are 3 levels – Weapons, Clothing, and Implants. Each level has about 16 slots. You can dress your character how ever you want which is kinda fun for those who like showing off their individualistic nature. <br>
<br>
There is PvP in the game, but I have yet to encounter any. The game is geared towards two sides conflicting…so you will either pick a side and fight for them or you will be neutral and not really be trusted by either side. The game is going to last 4 years and the outcome of which side wins will be based on the players’ actions during the course of the 4 years. I think it is kinda cool to be in a game where the players determine the final outcome. The game is deep… I thought EQ was a big game. This game is probably 2-3 times the size of all of EQ’s zones….and it is all beautiful. The music and sounds in the game sound like they were captured from real events. You should hear the rain and see the lightning storms. =) The first time I had lightning strike close to me I literally jumped. The lightning struck a cliff side and at my feet feel a few little rocks that were rolling by when they were blown off the side. They have spared no detail in making this game when it comes to graphics.<br>
<br>
Now for the down side. The game is badly bugged. It is supposed to go live on the 27th of June. That makes sense…but in the mean time there are a lot of people trying to find bugs in the beta that are getting very frustrated. The game is crashing quite a bit and there are many bugs in the game. Hopefully they will get these fixed before releasing the game…even if it sets their release date back. It is important to understand that they have been running the game in debug mode and have recently been doing stress testing so the system has been shakey. In all honesty, I think once the game goes live and has been up for a month, most of the bugs will have been done away with.<br>
<br>
OVEVIEW<br>
<br>
Pros: <br>
-Breath-taking graphics and sounds<br>
-Excellent game mechanics and GUI<br>
-Very diverse world with endless possibilities, both for characters and for the game<br>
-You can solo well or you can group; it is totally up to you. (Though I think you may not be able to solo much at higher levels…I haven’t gotten that far yet.)<br>
-You can build your character’s skills the way you want (I.e. – A martial artist can heal well if you train him in it. Kinda like a Monk having a Druid’s healing powers, though the Doctor can always do it better.)<br>
-Combat is easier to perform in AO than it is in EQ.<br>
-You can see EXACTLY how much exp you gain or lose, vice an orange/blue bar.<br>
-Short zone times<br>
- One server = worldwide communication.<br>
-NO TRAINS! Hehe<br>
-No KS’ing!<br>
-Player determined outcome<br>
-It is a new game with MUCH to explore…so it is hard to be bored.<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
-Buggy, for the time being<br>
-Crashes are abundant, for the time being<br>
-World might be TOO big<br>
-Can be kinda boring running everywhere, although there are methods of faster transpotation as well as methods of &quot;gating.&quot;<br>
-Laggy cities from so many people playing beta, but should be remedied once it goes live and people develop and spread out.<br>
-Game play can be monotonous if you stay in one spot for too long.<br>
-PvP, if you aren’t into it. It is part of the game since you take a side and fight for that side.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is just a SMALL overview of the game. There is just too much to talk about. The only way to realize how good it is is to play it for a few days and get to know how it works. I think the game, in its current state of bugginess, rates a 7. When the game goes live and they fix the little bugs and crashes, the game will be a 9.5. In comparison, I thought EQ was a 5 when it came out…and rose to a 7.5 in its current day and age with the expansions. EQ is a good game and is easy to play. AO takes a little getting used to, but once you figure it out it is pretty easy. AO just has way more to offer the player than EQ ever did…or probably ever will. Funcom is still looking at many ways to improve the game, even at this stage in development. Hopefully they will be listening more carefully to player ideas than Verant ever did. It is easy to see that people will be all pissed off in the beginning when they try out the game. I was annoyed because I was so used to EQ. Then I realized two things – 1) This is NOT EQ and 2) This is BETA! Some folks are not capable of realizing that at all…which leads to lots of moaning. Hehe <br>
