It Works!</span><hr size=1> Melee made Gate potions <br><br>In case some of you havent heard, we melee classes can now make our own gate potions (at least until we really piss off the dorfs).<br><br>Here's how:<br><br>(not written by me)<br><br>Here is the info on how to make the self teleport potion to thurgadin! In total took me 1 hour to get skill up in pottery to 125 and 2 hours to get ingredients in CC for about 6 of them. There are 3 things you need to do: 1 get your skill up in pottery, 2 get the ingredients from CC and 3 get the container to combine them in from Frundle <br>Frenkler in town. <br><br>1) To start you need to get your skill in pottery up to 120 or 125. To do this is easy and will cost less then 100pp and takes a hour or so. Go to any skill site and <br>find the easy way to do it. <br><br>2) Now you need to collect your ingedients. Go to CC. everything you need is there. hunt the miners up top for the small pieces and small bricks of velium. then drop <br>(make sure you have lev!) down to the bottom, run through the dorf town, and into the hall with the velium crawlers, spiderlings, and webmasters. in about an hour, <br>i had a stack of these and gated out. <br><br>head back to thurgadin. go in the bank. the vendor on the very left sells crystal shards and HQ firing sheets. buy 2 crystal shards and 1 HQ firing sheet. <br><br>go click on the pottery wheel in the bank. put the items in like this: <br><br>crystalline silk <br>crystalline silk <br>crystalline silk <br>glass shard <br>glass shard <br>small brick of velium <br><br>do not stack the silks. also, even though all other pottery i've done always requires a water flask, do not use one. i tried and it didn't combine. so NO WATER FLASK! <br>i'm around 100 in pottery and it was not trivial. <br><br>you will get an unfired velious vial. <br><br>right next to the pottery wheel is the kiln. combine the vial you just made with a high quality firing sheet. this will produce a velious vial. it was trivial at <br>100. <br><br><br>3)Find Frundle Frenkler to get container. She is by the Pally guild in a building. <br><br>Hail her and say: <br><br>You say, &quot;what velium vapors?&quot; <br>Frundle Frenkler says &quot;Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First you must fashion a velium vial, then <br>combine the vial with two small pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please keep the recipe a secret.&quot; <br><br>You say, &quot;what velium vial?&quot; <br>Frundle Frenkler says &quot;I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, and two glass shards. Then you'll <br>have to finish up by firing it in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet.&quot; <br><br>she will give you a 4 slot purifier. it is a container, so you will need an open inventory slot. <br><br><br>now, open that purifier box that you got and put in the vial, and 2 small pieces of velium. make sure they are not stacked. <br><br>small piece of velium <br>small piece of velium <br>velious vial <br><br>hit combine and you will have a vial of velium vapors. <br><br>VIAL OF VELIUM VAPORS <br>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br>EXPENDABLE CHARGES:1 <br>Effect: thurgadin gate <br>All/all <br><br>Gates you to the Bridge over the pit in Thurgadin <br><br>Btw they are No Drop and Lore so you can only have one at a time .....but you can keep the materials in the bank and make another in about 5 min since you are in thurgadin <br>already. This is like having dual bind points for melee classes. <br><br>The velium vials (fired and unfired) are NOT lore, so you can do like me and keep a bag of them in the bank waiting to be combined with the velium pieces for the last <br>step <br><br>- Everything except the initial components (silk, etc.) is NO DROP. <br><br>- It was trivial for me at 125. <br><br>- When you're working up your skill with bowls or whatever, don't bother to fire them in the kiln. Just destroy the unfired bowls - it costs less than buying the <br>firing sheets. <br><br>Logged on at 2pm with pottery at 0 <br>By 4pm pottery was 120 and I was able to make this. <br><br>The items to make it are easy as hell to get <br>13 silks and 5 small pieces - bought from a player for 20pp <br>7 small bricks - Vendors in thurg (12pp each) <br>Glass / sheet in the bank <br><br>Casting time is 10 seconds, which I think is better than shaman and store bought<br><br> <p>Balekan Nomad<BR>44th Season Paladin<BR>Valiant Hearts<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR>To fight against evil and help those in need that is the Kaladim creed</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukhael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Khael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 535<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/10/01 11:41:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thurgadin Gate Potion!

I got a skill increase every other attempt or so.  It was great!  I only wish the other skills rose as fast.  I then did a few batches of large bowls and got to 145 pretty fast.<br><br>BTW, if you can get Sands of Ro, you can make a WIS +2 range slot item for Clerics and Druids.  I already made back my investment selling these.<br><br>Anyway, I always carry a couple of C-T gate potions.  Makes me feel less helpless when I'm in Hate.  I always worry I'll go LD and come back to find everybody left without me.  :-)<br><br>This Thurgadin potion is by far one of the easiest to get in terms of combined time and money.  C-T's are free, but take time, and the Avatar of Fear can rock my world.  The shaman potions take no time, but are expensive in terms of coin, as are the store bought ones.<br><br>Besides, I usually donate 10 to 20pp for a teleport anyway, so 15pp for a free TP to Velious seems ok to me!<br><br>C-ya!<br><br> - Rilkar<br><br>P.S. Encouraged by my success with pottery I tried baking.  In 160 attempts I only got 17 skill increases.  :-(  I think my fletching rose that slowly (to 142) but I made arrows as I needed them, so it took a long time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valianthart>Valianthart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/01 7:08:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pottery Skills</span><hr size=1> Could you tell me the exact steps to increasing your pottery skill from 0 to 125?  i.e. the ingredients etc...

I'll give some short, details of what I did.<br><br>Medium bowls go trivial at 122.  You need a medium bowl sketch, flask of water, and a medium block of clay.  I found all these things and a pottery wheel in North Freeport.  The clay doesn't stack, but the sketches and water do.  Just make and destroy bowls in the wheel until you get to 122.  It took me very little time.<br><br>Note:  Firing an item in the kiln goes trivial long before making them on the wheel.  So don't bother to fire them.  The firing sheets don't stack and waste inventory space.<br><br>Large bowls go trivial at 148.  You need a large bowl sketch, flask of water, large block of clay, and a glass shard.  I found glass shards in the East Commons.  Shards and clay do not stack.  But I took 3 loads of shards to North Freeport, and got from 122 to 145 on those three loads.  Again, firing goes trivial before making, so don't bother.<br><br>That's how I got to 145 in pottery in about 2 hours.  My WIS is 109 and my INT is 75, so I'm not a genius.  The large bowls cost over 1pp per attempt, but the medium bowls were cheap.  Going from 0 to 122 cost about the same money as going from 122 to 145.  I didn't realy count my coppers, but I know I did the whole thing on less than 100pp.<br><br>I also mentioned a few magic things you can make to earn your investment back.  You can make three deities.  All three go in the range slot.  All three can be used by clerics and druids.  The first two can also be used by shamen.  A Protection Deity gives 3AC.  A Resisting Deity gives +2 SD, and +2 SM.  A Wisdom Deity gives +2 WIS.
