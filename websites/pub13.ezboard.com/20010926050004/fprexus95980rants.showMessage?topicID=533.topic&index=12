You don't recall all the pain and frustrations that Muerta, Ellendilh and I went through to lead raids?  You don't recall all the work we contributed to the guild?  I know, it was all about you helping me.  You never saw that I help you 10 times more than you help me.  Give up your righteous attitude, we all know what you really are. <p><P><select>

<br>
1.  You did say in guildchat that you had quit your job in order to focus on leveling your characters.  You had told us previously that you worked for Motorola, and that you had left because you wanted to be able to raid more often.<br>
<br>
2.  Dolphin is a superb player of his class.  I believe quite strongly that many of us on this server would have given Dolphin the white scale if one had crossed our path.  Dolphin definitely was deserving of his epic, and you were admirable with the fact that you gave it to him.  In my belief, he should have had his epic long before many others got theirs (stating this in a general sense not just the bard epics).<br>
<br>
3.  The Juggs raid in question.  Just like with any raid, when the raid leader says &quot;you have to be such-n-such level to attend,&quot; being 53 and 4 bubbles in is not the same as being 54.  While I can not speak for bards, I know that with tanks, every level counts.  Maybe we were silly for having a 54 requirement, but at the time, doing the Juggs was a very new experience for the Secret Guardians, and we were taking the camp seriously.  If only we knew then what we know now.<br>
<br>
4.  There is no denial that people left the Secret Guardians over conflicts with other members.  I will not deny my responsibility.  People often change guilds because they do not get along with other members.  I stuck to my beliefs, and there were individuals, even founding members, who disagreed with me.  Sometimes my views were promoted, sometimes they were not.  The same goes for Landis.  But ironically, there were people who left the guild because of you as well.<br>
<br>
But again, I return to the point that the Secret Guardians still exists.  If anyone desires to have the guildtag returned, I am sure that it will be.  Neither Landis nor myself are there, so we will not be present to cause discomfort.<br>
<br>
As for the Ragefire, it became understood that there was 6 minutes to distribute the no drop loot.  Clerics were oom to rez the fallen (after healing the survivors) because we had no cleric sticks at that time.  I do not remember what the loot was exactly (old age hits me hard here), but I do remember that time was an issue.  Many of us thought that this raid was like a Nagafen raid where there was time to rez the corpses and distribute loot.  There was not.  Landis had to make very fast decisions on loot distribution, and whether or not we agree with how he distributed it, the fact remained that it would had rotted if he had not.<br>
<br>
5.  I remember Tanoril's wedding being delayed because the cleric providing the vows was rezzing your ranger, Arten Swiftsteel.  That was the first time I met you, and the pattern persisted throughout most of our time spent together in the SG's.  There were many other times in guildchat that you advertised for rezzes, and there was one cleric in particular who I complimented on their endless patience for providing that service for you.<br>
<br>
Was Landis the bane of the Secret Guardians?  I don't believe so.  He lead the guild into a variety of accomplishments and worked hard to keep raids and loot flowing.  There are many things that the SG's would have never done without his guidance, knowledge or assistance.  He did many firsts for the guild, and then taught many of us how to do what he had learned.  Whether or not you agreed with all of his decisions is not as important as recognizing the amount of work and effort he put into the guild as it strengthened and grew.  Without his help, I know that I could not have lead the raids that I did.<br>
<br>
By no means, at any point in this post am I saying that you are a bad person.  What I am saying, though, is that I disagree with your perceptions regarding yourself and your gameplay.  I do think, though, that you may wish to consider therapeutic intervention regarding your hostility toward our destruction of the Secret Guardians.  You seem to be carrying quite a heavy burden of grief regarding this issue, and I am sorry that it still pains you so much.<br>

I would really like to drop the whole &quot;My personal life issue&quot; I think that was a misunderstanding cause I don't think I ever stated i want to quit so i could raid more since we all raided at night &amp; I worked 9-5. That is a moot point with some room for misunderstanding. Landis had no right to bring up the issue of me loosing my job in RL. As it was to me &amp; many others who got laid off, it was a very painfull moment. Muerta, you met me long before that cause Arten was lvl 38 when i stoped playing him &amp; he joined SG's back when we has lvl 12. Tesoro was lvl 15 when Tanoril's wedding took place. Furethurmore -- I would really like this fighting to stop between us all now. I think we have all said what we have needed to say and have gotten nowhere. I know this is not a DD vs FA thing. It is a Muerta/Ell/Landis vs Tesoro thing and i thank yuo for not bringing our guilds into this. But I do not care if i was the one who started all this or nor am i looking to be the one who gets in the final word. But, i would like to be the one who puts all this to res. We all used to be friends way back when we were a family (I know it seems wierd) &amp; I would like to extend my hand of &quot;friendship&quot; (yes friendship) out once more to you three in an effort to forget what we all have said in the past &amp; loose all ill will/grudges/ &amp; anger. We all once made something so special that it was unbreakable by any rant board or any lewt war. I miss those day &amp; i guess I was just really hurt they were gone. So, i now toss the ball over to you three &amp; see if not only we can all be friends (as in laugh together once again, chat, &amp; raids/group) but maybe also help our guild become friends aswell.<br>
<br>
My Final Words on this matter -- anybody can feel free to add wat they want about me. I will not reply, I am geting to old to be bitter. <br>
<br>
My hand is out there Muerta, Ell, &amp; Landis -- upto you three if you want to shake it &amp; become friends again. And Muerta, maybe we can get Tanoril to call us both Daddy sometime <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Secondly, 'shacke your hands and be friends again' was probably something which worked at kindergardenschool, but, at 35, I am way beyond that period. <br>
<br>
Over a year, a lot of insults have been issued by Tesoro against my RL wife, my friends and myself. I have myself insulted Tesoro on some occasions. A lot of presure and negative feelings have built up. I cannot say I can forget everything like that, because it would be dishonnest towards Tesoro. <br>

The best I can propose is keeping distance and a mutual ignorance on the boards and in game (as I thought it was our common agreement before Tesoro started flaming us again on this board). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uellendilhsilvermist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ellendilh Silvermist</A> at: 8/24/01 2:27:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umuerta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Muerta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/24/01 2:25:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~phiphix/dance_of_the_dead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tesoro grow up!</span><hr size=1> <br>

Actually,  I did not have time to respond Ghostfromthepast.  Having raided late last night and had a busy day today, I was unable to post to the boards until now.<br>
<br>
I have no war with Tesoro.  There have been difficulties between us but there comes a time to put the past behind you and move forward.  It saddened me how much distress that Tesoro was feeling regarding the whole issue of my leaving the SG's but hopefully at this point, we can all move forward again.<br>
<br>
Tesoro, ironically, when Ellendilh came home from work, he pointed out that it was Tesoro as well, and not Arten present at the wedding.  So I stand corrected there although I have to admit that both bards and rangers die frequently so sometimes it is hard to distinguish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Yorr, good to hear from you again!  I wondered if you were still running around!  I hope that Everfrost still welcomes you with a frosty mug everytime you are able to wander home.<br>
<br>
To everyone, let's put the past behind us and consider this topic of discussion closed.<br>

I think I have a pretty good idea why people left SGs and I cant blame Landis, Ell or Muerta for leaving and not any for following to FA it's just bs to have to read this trash <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And just for the record Muerta.. not all would be invited back to SG's now as its rebuilding very slow and carefully, even you would have to apply for membership and survive the votings muahahahah<br>
<br>
just a wish to end with and that would be.. stop it now.. its not doing anyone any good at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
