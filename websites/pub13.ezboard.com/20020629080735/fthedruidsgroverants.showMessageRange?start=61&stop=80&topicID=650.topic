align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My 2cp</span><hr size=1> I agree with most of what is proposed.<br>
<br>
The healing issue is a must. The proposals made would be effective, and probably not over powering. Agro from healing is a big issue i have too... I can't count the times i have died on raids from a single chloroplast. Playing the healing role is where druids are put on raids, but it is their weakest role.<br>
<br>
Dot's... Yes, an upgrade after lvl 53 would defiantly be fitting.<br>
<br>
Epic effect. This i don't know... I do agree that it is annoying that epic can't be used to dot mobs that cant be snared, and the snare is annoyingly short duration. Changing the effect to dot only would be good, and if this is done i would like to see duration reduced, though moving the same 1600dmg into 1 minute would be exsecive imo unless the epic effect is the upgrade to the winded death line... so maybe make it 2 minutes for 1600, and low resist?<br>
<br>
Luclin ports... Would be nice, but even wizards only get portals to the nexus that only work from luclin so i really don't care about this.<br>
<br>
Cold spells... druids are suppose to be good at fire, ice is just there so we can 'maybe' nuke something that is immune to fire. If anything is going to be done to nukes i would rather have a fire based lure than cold debuff.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  The best way to get a healing upgrade for Druids, is to create a Torpor-like HoT with harsh drawbacks.  No one can complain, not even VI.<br>
<br>
Here's an example that I posted previously...<br>

<br>
Stacks with other HoT spells... Torpor included.<br>
<br>
At the moment I cannot agree to a DD healing upgrade.  It runs the potential to eliminate Clerics in XP groups.  Yes, I know you're not address XP groups, but an increase in DD healing will affect Clerics regardless. <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

I have noticed a large number of threads by trolls, and responded to by druid trolls. (yes - both sides)<br>
<br>
As pointed out by many in posts:<br>
<br>
Solo ability in the high end game is viable for many classes. (Notice I don't say all)<br>
Raid ability (or really desirability) is low for a couple of classes. (Druids, Necros, Mages in particular) [interesting that these are the easiest non-twink classes to level to the high end game - however with twinks they are not the best]<br>
PvP - I have no opinions on this area - not qualified to comment.<br>
<br>
As others have said, complete heal is the spell that makes your heals look poor. I realize you only are asking for the non-complete heal equivalance, but lets be honest and admit this will not at all solve the raid desirability. If you had a choice of a druid or a cleric (even with the petition points in place) you would pick 1 druid and 20 clerics.<br>
<br>
Every class would like their power increased, but if all classes have their power increased then we just have inflation and you end up where you started. So when &quot;trolls&quot; come by and suggest you are asking too much, listen to why they say it. Druids are certainly not the most broken class even at level 60.<br>
<br>
I realize I have not experienced a druid in the high end game, so I will not try to slam the arguements here. There have been some very good posts from all sides of the issue, and based upon conversations I have had, and posts I have read, I would like to suggest the following:<br>
<br>
Your Epic should have a more useful proc. However, realize that only a few of the epic procs are that powerful. (However, they are often useful. I wonder how you would feel if the proc was changed to a right click SOW.)<br>
<br>
I think ALL healing classes should have complete heal at level 60. (Yes this means, paladins, druids, shammies, and maybe (not sure) rangers) Either that (My real preference) is a new spell as follows:<br>
<br>
Partial Heal : 1200 mana - heals 50% of the hit points of target.<br>
<br>
Clerics would rightfully feel their heal is still very powerful, while allowing a group of druids to almost do the same job. (This I could see as making a druid VERY useful on raids - one of your goals.)<br>
<br>
My final point is this - Verant has a vision for each class (though they do seem to be letting each class drift towards the middle) We tend to view the classes by our own vision of what we think the class should be, but we have only a partial view of Verant's view. We do know the following:<br>
<br>
Druids are fantastic at transportation. (While I would love more tranportation in Luclin, I too feel that a wizard port should own there.)<br>
Druids are a kick tail class at least up to level 50. (Some classes cannot say this. And before you say ... Fix this class ... remember that resources are limited, so are you suggesting druids be fixed before a nearly broken class get fixed... well you can see why there are trolls.)<br>
The question is ... what is Verant's vision of where they think druids should excel, and where they should be less than the top? From everything I have read, the answer is druids do not excel beyond the two points mentioned above. I suspect this is part of Varents vision - for druids do have a wide range of skills.<br>
<br>
I know those who have posted here with 50+ level druids love their class. Remember that when you present what is broken or needing improvement.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with pretty much everything that was stated in the Manifesto of Druids. I really do believe sadly, that the Druid's role has substantially diminished in a group or raid setting. Some areas of note that I most whole-heartedly agree with are:<br>
<br>
1. DoT upgrade past 53lvl<br>
2. PoTG to stack with either BoA or other cleric buffs. It does stack with Clarity, so I see no reason why it can't stack with a Cleric's armor buff<br>
3. I wouldn't get rid of the Epic snare, but I would upgrade the DoT so it is in line with being able to deal with Velious and Luclin mobs more effectively. Perhaps less resistance to the mobs<br>
4. There is a stigma associated with Druids which IMO is something that Verant has never really spoken out against. The stigma is that Druids are primarily a solo class. While this is true to some degree, there are Druids who prefer to group rather than solo, and the stigma follows them unfortunately. Most higher end pick-up groups will not allow a Druid into a group, and will even go so far as to say, &quot;You're a solo class. Go solo.&quot; I really believe Verant should do something to dispel this myth that Druids can ONLY solo. They can do so very much more than that, and hopefully will be allowed certain upgrades to allow them to do so.<br>
5. Druids, as well as most caster classes, have the misfortune of having almost all their 59-60lvl spells be Drop spells. Unless one belongs to a very powerful guild capable of camping/farming said spells, there is a lack of motivation to reach the end game, because their spell power is severely limited. I have seen many 59-60lvl casters only able to use 58lvl spells, because of the difficulty involved with gaining these spells. Many times the /auction sets the price of these spells to outrageous amounts that prohibits the Int/Wis caster to purchase said spells.<br>
6. There should be some port location for Druids to go to in Luclin, or at least an evac. Many times a group might only have a Druid, and if forced to leave the moon on an evac the group may break up, as they are then forced to go back to Luclin via the spires.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> The problem is your a jack of all trades. You can't have the &quot;best&quot; of everything.<br>
<br>
You want better heals the clerics will jump up and down. And they will. ( fair enough too.. be honest )<br>
<br>
You want better dots, then its the shamans turn. Or, take the dots away from the shamans and take the buffs away from the druids... EVEN<br>
<br>
As for porting into Luclin... well I agree there as long as its druids/wizards. But considering its on the moon and you get there via our spires I don't think much of your chances. Plus getting to the moon was the wizard head huncho Al'kabor's work as detailed in his writings on Everquests site. Even Eq people said &quot;I wish people would follow the storyline&quot;<br>
<br>
Personally if I was working on your fixes I would be looking into your nature animal ability. Allow you to change into alot of different animals that gives you certain abilities. Why on earth the shaman turns into a bear and the enchanter has the werewolf is wierd.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

<br>
Hello? Is the light on inside? We never said clerics shouldn't get a healing boost for Divine Light. <br>
<br>
And as for your dot statement, the point of getting an upgrade to Winged Death is the fact that there is really only one viable dot, Winged Death, to use on raids and that from 53 to 60 we get no upgrade at all, which doesn't fall in line with the game or with us being the third best damage-over-time dealers. I also play a 60 shaman, so I do know what dots are available and used by shamans, and druids don't have anything that comes remotely close to the big damage you can do in two-three minutes time. Having an upgrade to Winged Death isn't game-upsetting at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/useriena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seriena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 3:08:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us!

But, Sorrun, I agree that it's the sterotype of druids, that keeps most druids from groups. I admit that I'm extremely critical of other druids myself when one is in my group. /shrug I'm spoiled, since I never have to lfg (always grouped with friends). But, I've had so many druids talk in game with me about how they can never find groups, etc. How they are giving up their druid for a more needed class (shm, clr, chanter, warrior). How they feel useless on raids. Shrugging that off to being a bad player only goes so far imo.<br>
<br>
Maybe the petition asks for a lot. All I'm personally asking for is an improvement to our existing heals. Then again, even if they did nothing (which is mostly likely going to be the case) it won't bother me much as I play my monk more often then not anyway these days. <p><br><br>Seriena, 60 druid<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> I think Druids suffer from hybriditis.  It an affliction that leaves people asking &quot;what is my role?&quot;.  As a bard I feel your pain (you know how many bards want Double Attack? LOL).  <br>
<br>
You are the top 1-4 in the following:<br>
Snaring - #1 <br>
Travel (Ports/Sow) - #1 overall<br>
DOT's - #3<br>
Tracking - #2<br>
Cold/Fire Resists - #2 (bards are better)<br>
Hp/AC and Ability Buffs - #3<br>
Healing - #3/4<br>
Charming - #4<br>
<br>
Clerics do not port, sow, and their attack spells against non-undead are a joke.  They cannot solo well at all.<br>
<br>
Shamans might be overpowered, however.  They get Sow, Dots (definitely inferior to yours), Slow, Haste, and superior healing abilities.  They can regen mana much faster and play an integral part of any melee group.  When they re-examine classes don't be surprised if the Shaman is nerfed.<br>
<br>
You are a utility player not a primary anything.  Perhaps they should add to your 50+ abilities but you are in a group most of the time to snare, evac, port, dot, and in a pinch heal.  If there is no shaman you are adding the attack buffs.  I think THAT is where they should reexamine druids.  Make them more of a buffing alternative to shamans and clerics.<br>
<br>
Of the druids posting here,  how many of you specialized in Alteration rather then Evocation?  If you chose Alteration and are having problems healing I feel for you and they should look into the class.  If you chose Evocation to help you solo mobs faster and level from 30-50 faster then I have no sympathy for you post 50.  In that case you are a DOT machine and also there to evac in a pinch.    <br>
<br>
I realize this is a bit of a rambling post but I think you have to be objective about your role.  The changes you want should be in small steps or you might see the nerf bat later on down the road. Good luck.<br>

I have noticed a severe lack in the effectiveness of druids as well.  I am a 59 almost 60 druid.<br>
<br>
First off it is very hard to get a group.  In a good exp group you can get way more EXP grouped than being solo, as long as you are grouped with talented people.  However, a druid is generally the last class anyone would look for to include in a good exp group, and out of the priest classes, by far the last, because we add nothing.<br>
<br>
A Shaman and Cleric both add buffs.  A Shaman adds slow(vital, a exp group doesn't even need a cleric with a good shaman who knows what he doing), can haste and debuff, and most importantly, their buffs, including HP buffs, stack with a Clerics.<br>
<br>
Druids are picked to join groups only as a last resort, because we don't add anything that can benefit a group.  The problem is not only with high end game raiding, but with everday experience playing as well.  Most dungeons, and most High End raiding are also done indoors, limiting a few spells which could be beneficial but are outdoor only.  Harmony(which VI will never allow to be indoors I don't think), SoW(which is shared with shamans), and most of our AE spells.  I would love to allow Harmony to be used indoors, but I think VI believes the spell too powerful and won't allow it.  However, two things that could help us is to allow our AE to be cast indoor and to give us a 50+ indoor SoW spell.<br>
<br>
I think I read someone talking about a mana regen spell.  I had this idea myself, a line like HP regeneration, coming in single target and group form, perhaps starting at 44 or 49, and capping out with a level 60 group regrowth of the mind or something, that stacks with Kodiac.  The logistics of the spell can be worked out later, but something similar to Regrowth of the Grove, 15 min duration, and maybe something like 10 mana a tick.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of a CR debuff to go along with our Cold nukes.  However, I also think we need a Lure based Ro's.  What they should do is add a CR debuff spell at the same level as the two Ro's, then have a combo FR/CR debuff spell.  A lure based FR/CR spell, similar to the unresistable malo would be a nice level 60 spell.<br>
<br>
A new snare spell and/or a lure based snare would be nice.  For balancing the lure snare, the mobs that VI do not want to have their movement reduced would still be immune to this spell, but this can be a good druid only spell useful in both exp and raid situations.  The AE snare we have is basically useless, and they could easily just make this spell an improved snare with reduction of say 60-70% movement.  Then somewhere around 58-60 give us a lure ensnare with 50% reduction in movement.<br>
<br>
I know some people may say that SoE is our Sow II, but this spell is not wanted by many people, because it does not stack with Acumen or DMF.  SoE is nice for us to get around on our own, but give us a SoW II that we can cast on others without them complaining.<br>
<br>
Druids really need another DoT, either an improvement to WD or Breath of Ro or both.  This will not unbalance the DoT ability of Shamans or Necros.  Both of those classes have more mana efficient DoTs than Druids, and not only that, but both have the ability to speed up their mana recovery far easier than a druid.  In fact, Shamans and Necros DoTs are almost exactly the same as far as being efficient, except Splurt which is probably the most mana efficient in game.  Here is a break down(I used Caster Realm for my data.  To figure out mana efficiency I divided max possible damage by mana cost, to figure out how much damage per mana point.)<br>
<br>
Shamans get:<br>
56 Bane of Nife, does 150 DD + 1448 over time 425 mana cost, has a 3.9 damage per mana point ratio.<br>
59 Pox, does 90 DD + 1998 over time 430 mana cost, has a 4.8 damage per mana ratio.<br>
<br>
Necros get:<br>
Splurt, rough estimate(didn't have exact) 1600 damage for 237 mana, which is a huge 6.8 damage per mana point.<br>
Pyrocuror does 1998 damage for 400 mana, has a 5.0 damage per mana point.<br>
Funeral Pyre does 2160 damage for 450 mana, has a 4.8 damage per mana point.<br>
<br>
Druids get:<br>
Breath of Ro:  920 damage + debuff effects for 250 mana, which is 3.7 damage per mana point.<br>
Winged Death:  1287 damage for 350 mana, which is also 3.7 damage per mana point.<br>
<br>
Not only are Shaman/Necro DoTs more efficient, but they can also regen their own mana, considerably lowering their downtime.<br>
<br>
Like what was suggested, we need a new DoT, which is slightly more mana efficient, around 4.2-4.5 damage per mana ratio.  Level 59 would be a good place for this spell, and I also believe shamans should get a new nuke at 59 as well, because just like we don't get DoTs, they don't get Nukes.  A lure DoT, like for example a Lure based Ro's could also be an option.<br>
<br>
To me, it makes no sense that Focus Of Spirit stacks with say Aego(which gives 405 HP along with STR/DEX), but no druid spell will.  Why then not make it so that there was a Natureskin/PoTG type spell similar to FoS that would stack with Aego?  The spell could say give 400 more HP, include a HP and/or Mana Regen, and a small AC bonus of 20 or so.  Make it stackable with Aego, but unstackable with FoS.  This does not eliminate a Shaman spell, it can just help with splitting up buffing duty.  For example, tanks and so forth will prolly want FoS for the STR and DEX, while casters will want the Druid equivalant which adds regen/mana regen.  Make it a level 60 spell(can make it so that is what PoTG does) with a single target and group version just like FoS is.<br>
<br>
Anyway, these are my ideas, some may have been expressed by others before, but I while I read a lot today I can't read everything, and hey it is a good thing if we all notice the difficulties 50+ both regular grouping and raiding.<br>
<br>
So to summarize:<br>
SoW II<br>
Indoor SoW<br>
Indoor AEs<br>
Improved Snare(60-70%)<br>
Lure Snare(50%)<br>
CR debuff<br>
FR/CR debuff<br>
Lure FR/CR debuff<br>
New and more efficient DoT.<br>
Mana Regen spell like Chloro/Regrowth line.<br>
HP buff stackable with Aego(can just alter current PoTG and introduce a single target version).<br>
<br>
I think a Mana Regen spell and a stackable PoTG along with the lure snare can make druids very viable in the high end game, and also assist in 50+ grouping exp.<br>

The sad thing is that the population of druids across EQ is the highest in percentage, and you will whine your way into getting some of the changes you have asked for.  Just like you all whined your way into camps and whined when groups wouldnt take you except to TP, group SOW, and Chloro....<br>

&quot;This brings us nicely to our third concern: DoTs. Druids don't receive an upgrade to damage-over-time spells after level 53. We would ask for an upgrade to Winged Death—something along the lines of 1950 damage over 50 seconds at level 58 or 59.&quot;<br>

I did not know about the harmony and I disagree that they are changing the resistance....bad idea.  To the guy about the charm...EVERY class that can charm as the creature turn on them. You would get enchanters blowing bubbles out of their ears if you made it not aggressive afterwards.<br>
I do not in any way, shape, or form agree with group healing. That should be left to clerics only. <br>
Just because druids are not the best for raids does not mean you should shout out a petition to want to heal more. <br>
In groups, personally I love to have druids. You think playing a druid is hard to get a group? HA! Try playing an enchanter levels 1-15...you'll be singing a different song.  I've played tons of characters and the enchanter was the worst till breeze.  And still half the time after that they don't want you in a group....just tell you that they will pay you for a breeze. <br>
<br>
Personally I just think that the druids are on a power struggle. Looke at it this way...a level 18 cleric and a level 19 druid have the exact same heal spell. Once higher level the cleric dominates the healing and I just feel the druids are flustrated because it's no longer around the same.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukyrilia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyrilia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 3:25:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Why changes just for druids?</span><hr size=1> I agree with some of your changes, but they don't just apply to druids. Shamans have the same problems, in fact more.<br>
<br>
Lack of healing ability: I dislike your statement that states a level 60 shaman can use Torpor to heal effectively. While technically true, Torpor is one of THE RAREST spells in the game. Less than 10 percent of level 60 shamans actually have the spell. So, for a &quot;non-uber&quot; shaman, we're stuck with Chloroblast. I'd love to have something even EQUAL to natures touch, let alone better.<br>
<br>
Epic effect: While sad to see the druid epic snare/dot gets resisted, at least yours is useful. The Shaman epic is a cut down version of the necro Splurt spell. 1200 damage over 1 1/2 mins.<br>
<br>
DoTs: These are supposed to be the main fighting tools of Necros and Shaman. Druids have some of the best DDs, you don't need the best DoTs as well.<br>
<br>
Just my $0.02. Hope you all get some good stuff, with any luck we will too.<br>
