What is this centi longsword I hear so much about and what kind of stats does it have?<br><br>4.  Is a Centi War Spear a good weapon to use?  A friend of mine has offered one to me for free.<br><br>5.  Where do you buy the Instrument of Nife spell?<br><br>6.  What level should I start my Armor of Ro quests?  I can get a level 52 necro to help me with any questing.<br><br>7.  Is Crusty Armor a bad choice for a Paladin?  A level 52 Paladin on my server said CHA made no difference for us but I've seen posts here from Paladins who seem to think it makes a difference.  Crusty Armor has bad CHA penalties from what I have seen.  Yet the same friend who has given me a Centi War Spear has also given me many Crusty Armor pieces until I am high enough to do my Armor of Ro quests.<br><br>8.  Do any of you bother with bows?<br><br>Thanks in advance to anyone who can help with these questions.

We had a group with 36, 34, 32 paladins and a 29 wiz. For two hours we decimated the entire upstairs, (the hand three times), the Unrest Noble, the Undead Knight, everything.... at one point we ran out of stuff to kill and taunted Toklar into the big room downstairs.<br>ION + Ghoulbanes x3 was incredible. Nothing undead stood against us for any period of time and I was rarely down 3 bubbles of health.<br>Upshot.. I went into this one gold into 32, two hours later DING 33. Fastest leveling I've seen in quite a bit. Yes, the sword is worth it... but even more important in Unrest is the damage you can do when grouped with other Paladins in that zone." <br><br>Aaranon Thaedson<br>The Rathe <br><br><br><br>Long time ago on my original pally I had Ghoulbane. Undead didn't stand a chance.<br><br>Also if I use Lull then I use a BOW to pull. Cause Lull only last a few seconds. But I don't worry about Archery skill cause I just use it to pull in some situations (like using Lull). <p><img src=http://www.villagephotos.com/extern/421580.jpg> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udeezle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deezle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/12/02 2:07:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sylvergryphonbrotherhood.com/members/thumbs/thumb_deezle.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 16 Paladin with Some Questions for the Knight Lords</span><hr size=1> 1. Both. Especially at lower levels, these 2 skills are your meat and potatoes, keep them both maxed. Actually you should have all of your skills maxed but these 2 are most important.<br>2. Start looking for something else right away, but you can keep using Ghoulbane until past level 30. But you should get at least a passable 2 hander soon so you can keep that skill up to speed.<br>3. Dunno, I don't own one, but I hear they're pretty decent. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  12/24 I think?<br>4. Great weapon at your level. 20/30, 2 handed piercing (which is not a separate skill btw, it uses regular piercing skill). Good enough to last you until the mid 40's or so. By 50 you should really have something better however.<br>5. Shadow Haven, Cleric / Paladin guild, in the center of the east end of the zone. Go to the back of the building, it's the one merchant who won't call you names and tell you to take a hike, hehe.<br>6. Level 61. Just Say No to Ro.<br>7. Crusty is great stuff until you get considerably higher in level. The charisma loss means nothing, just remember to take it off when you're buying / selling so you can get better prices.<br>8. Sure, I used a bow for a long time until I got into my high 40's and realized I couldnt hit the broad side of a barn anymore (/rude Verant for capping my Archery skill at 75). At lower levels you can still hit stuff though so keep it for now...but someday you'll want to put it away and get a good range slot item in there and pull with spells.<br>9. Shields are for people who don't know how useless they are and how much more damage you can do with a 2 hander. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Deezle Suture - 55th Knight of Tunare - Yeah.

Paladin skill with a bow sucks to be sure, but there are still reasons to carry one even if you don't equip it much.<br><br>Pulling long range is the primary use of a bow. As a paladin with a crappy skill cap you are not going to deal damage with a bow, but long range bow plus range arrows can pull from double or triple the distance of your spells. Very useful outdoors and even in some indoor settings to get single pulls.<br><br>Peeling mobs off a puller on raids is also sometimes needing a bow. Similar to pulling, you can shoot a mob farther out and there is no casting time. This allows you to peel farther from your raid force and reduce puller deaths and trains in places like fear.<br><br>Finally, there are some uber bows out there, both in terms of stats that exceed other range items and in terms of damage/delay ratio. It'd be a pity if you had one of these available to load it up and pull the trigger only to get the message &quot;you have become better at archery (1)&quot;<br><br>In short...use all your abilities.

Bows are of little use indoors due to line of sight issues and they also do not buy any range in 99% of circumstances. Pulling with stun gives you a second or two to run and causes very little aggro (or use cancel magic or other low-aggro spell if you're really concerened about it). Also, at high levels, some mobs will summon you instead of chasing you IF youdo damage to them. I've never been summoned by a mob that I hit with cease, however.<br><br>Have a cap at 75 means that you start missing a LOT by level 20. As a human wearing bronze armor at the time, the bow wasn't worth the weight of it and the arrows (paladins didn't have a spell that could be used for pulling until 30th level, then, either).<br><br>Skip the Ro armor quests unless you want to do them for RP/fun reasons. While they are decent pieces, your time would be more effeciently spent levelling and MAKING platinum instead of spending it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a><BR>56th level Knight of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Xegony<BR>"I believe in the might of Mithaniel Marr.

I did several pieces of the Ro armor quests but did not focus on that entirely, got what was needed while getting exp or other things.  Got MM granite while camping Xic for the SoulFire hilt, got melatite while hunting in SolA, etc.  At level 55 my 2hs is maxed, 1hs is maxed, pierce is maxed and 1hb is nearing 200, still want to work on 2hb too.  One thing I did was, when I got the MotQ long ago, to train skill points in pierce, good way to get it up fast if you have points you have not used.  I also disagree with a shield being useless, the Sarnak Battle Shield is far from usless, especially when combined with Sword of the Morning or other nice 1hs weapon.  Lots of people knock bash but I think it is a great skill, does a bit of damage and can interrupt spells and stun as well.  2hs is for sure the meat and potato skill of paladins but 1hs with a good weapon and good shield are not too bad either.  Good luck to you and early congrats on the GhoulBane.<br> <p><p><table><tr><td style="filter:glow(color=redstrength=5);font-family:bankgothic;font-weight:BOLD;font-size:'10pt'"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=247362> <fontcolor=white>Bonlainy Trueheart</a><br>Knight of Rodcet Nife<br><i><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=2686&sortby=character_name&showroles=1"> <font color=white> UnyieldingPower</a>~Vazaelle</font></i></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrimrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimrix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 1:31:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 16 Paladin with Some Questions for the Knight Lords</span><hr size=1> Thank you very much for your kind words. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><table width="327" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">  <tr>     <td><img src="http://www.computer-guidance.com/eb/grimrix1.jpg" width="327" height="144"></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td align="center" bordercolor="333333"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Dwarven       Paladin Level 24 - Vazaelle Server</strong></font></td>  </tr></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrimrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimrix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/19/02 9:29:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugrimrix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimrix</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(7/19/02 6:40:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 16 Paladin with Some Questions for the Knight Lords</span><hr size=1> Well some bad news. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Kanthuk Ogrebane, the 2nd step on the GB quest was not in his place tonight.
