I most definatly wouldnt try the west wall if thats the case.  Probably your easiest solution would be to borrow a high level enchanter or two for the raid.   The easiest way to do fear in my experience without an enchanter is to do a north wall break.   If you know what your doing, you can make your way to the north wall behind the fire ring with just an invis.  It takes a bit of practice to get there successfully.     <br>
<br>
To do a north wall break, you have everyone zone in one group at a time, or even better, one person at a time if everyone knows how to do it.   When you zone into the fear portal you head straight out with a sow and an invis.   As you run towards the fire ring, youll see on your right hand side a bridge of some sort with a bell near it.  You want to stay right by this bridge as you continue running to the firewall.   Be aware of any Scarelings, Shiverbacks, or spinechillers you see, they all have the ability to see invis, so avoid them at all cost.    When you reach the firewall turn to the left and follow the outside of the firewall arround until you reach the area where the firewall is closest to the north wall.   Camp out on the north wall, rince and repeat with everyone in the raid.    the key to making this tactic work is to get a cleric camped out in this spot.   This spot is fairly safe, no mobs will agro on you if you keep a tight camp.  Occationally a glare lord might path near by and agro on your camp if your not careful, but they dont pose much of a threat by themselves.<br>
<br>
Pulling Tactics without an enchanter...<br>
<br>
Easiest way to pull fear without an enchanter is to have one person with a run enhancing buff  (preferably a bard or paladin with holy steed) run out and grab a few mobs, then kite them arround.   This person needs to be able to refresh his/her run buff because if it fades and they cant refresh it quickly, they will die.     This person will kite the mobs arround in a very large circle, and have someone pick off of them when the circle brings them semi close to camp.   Remember the agro range in fear is HUGE, so be sure to have this kiter running circles a good ways away from camp.  Paladins make good pickers as well because if you use a long durration stun to pick, the kiter will have taken the other mobs away from the picked mob before the stun wears, thus lowering the chance that you get more then one with the pick.<br>
<br>
If your guild has a good ammount of 55+ wizards and mages you could try an AE fear break, the only problem with this is your going to need to borrow a couple of real good enchanters.   Its essentially the same thing as a west wall break, you just have a crazy paladin with divine aura go round up as many mobs as possible, and run them into camp.   Enchanters stun, wizards nuke, mobs die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Very fun!    I wouldnt recommend this unless you borrow some experienced enchanters.  I would have to say though, AE fear is the most fun, not to mention the quickest way to clear fear.   You can clear fear in an hour from start to finish with AE, where as the fastest I have seen it done using a non AE method is about 4 hours.  If your a tank, bring a good book though cause your going to feel pretty useless unless you are pulling.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.<br>

I still like the zone, even tho ive been there over 150 trips(tho ive barely been there any in the last year few trips here and there), even tho its old and way trivial by now.<br>

Most people curse the fact the zone in isnt safe, the large agro ranges etc.....but really thats part of the allure of the zone. I hope they have a plane just like it in pop.

<br>
<br>
for you though without chanter you want to do the hall butt to safe spot.  run a melee in first head ne to the TT bridge. hug the TT cause they dont see invis. run north to firewall turn left hug the firewall. hop over to center of the firewall along the north wall. thats almost entirely safe. camp that melee out if he did it without agro. if not die at safe camp.  next run clerics in together have them invised with bind up.  they run same path bring agro. at safe camp they both bind and /q if they have agro. it sounds crazy but your raid cannot fail if you get a cleric bound a safe camp.  this is sooo important on your first raid of fear.  next just invis people up after the clerics camp and have them train safe camp. die at safe camp.  <br>
<br>
most people use a die in place on this north camp break in but i prefer to have everyone just die at safe camp and save the hour long corpse run.<br>
<br>
After that start rezzing... fairly safe spot.  shouldnt have any trouble. even if you do you got bound clerics.<br>
<br>
as far as pulling have someone try to single.  in the event that they cant single(double) then have them do the circle around teh nw corner. big circle.  and yes a bard (for speed) is a good choice.  <br>
<br>
one thing about the run path.  tell people NOT to avoid the TTs that you see when you run NE. avoiding them puts you in pathing range of the see invis stuff on the west wall.  thats where your failed runs come from.  <br>
<br>
<br>
but if you get mezzers then west wall seems more practical using the evac more then less strategy.<br>

<br>
Which wasn't all that long.<br>
<br>
We tried a combination of evac break and training the mobs to the upper east side.  Unfortunately, the person doing the training didn't get far enough.  So the first break attempt didn't go very well.<br>
<br>
Subsequent attempts had to deal with a very riled up Plane of Fear, due to the failure to get stuff dragged far enough away from the portal.  It ended up taking four break attempts by the original raid crew, and then another three attempts by the TOV squad from the alliance my guild is a member of.<br>
<br>
In all, I died 5 times and lost two orange bubbles of xp.  There was no loot.  <br>
<br>

Next time I think I'll go with the more conventional approach.  On the bright side, at least my signature is accurate again, eh? <p><div align="center"><font size="2">Aragir Lancot<BR>

Sorry to hear it went that poorly Aragar...<br>
<br>
My guild went into fear on a pick-up raid last night.   having read this thread, I was very thanksful.<br>
<br>
We zone in, west wall....too many people lost invis..went badly.  Wipeout.    We had no enchanters.     We picked up a couple while I got back to the portal.<br>
<br>
I decided this is the way we were going to do it, I kite the zone, everyone goes in, and rez.    I specified the rez order, and had 2 clerics to do it, and 2 enchanters to protect.  <br>
<br>
Well, it worked!!!!   I had 15 mobs on me.   Wall was clear.  We had 75% of the people rezed.   We had the west wall broken with wanderers.  <br>
<br>
And some noob zones in and trains the camp.   Sigh.<br>
<br>
So, we tried it a third time....of course, we had limited people.   I train again.....Note, the kite the north end works great provided 2 things happen a) you do not get a glare lord (their spells will kill you) b) you do not get arrogant with how easy it is, and start talking to people....SMACK right into a tree...was funny that I did it....sigh.<br>
<br>
Well, we had the camp broken a THIRD time....scareling shows up, someone gets shadowstepped a LONG way...they get agro on the way back...don't stand and die...and we get wiped out again.<br>
<br>
Anyhow.....long night, nice loot that rotted because we couldn't get the classes rezed in time...kiled about 15 mobs.<br>
<br>
I have decided pick-up raids are rough.    Paladin rez's even at 50% are awesome!!!!!   Talk about helping a raid get back onto it's feet faster.    <br>
<br>
My question is this.   HOW?   How do I make it so clear to people who have not been on a raid, that there are rules to keep people from dying and having long CR's.   How do you get people to understand the absolute Necessity of standing and dieing?    <br>
<br>
Sigh....I was Shadowstepped after we were finally back in fightingforce......popped at the fetid fiend house...2 mobs at the camp.   I trained them away and out of agro range...and died....using DA and LH to stay alive while the group killed the ones at the camp...took me 10 minutes to get back.  Had I trained the camp, it would have been 1 hour.      <br>
<br>
So, how do you get inexperienced people to understand?  anyone have an idea?<br>

I don't much like that option, but if they persist in not learning, you're just much better off without them.<br>
<br>
Another bright side to my raid was that I put a relative unknown in charge of a group.  I could tell right away he had never been group leader on a big raid like this, because I kept having to send him tells asking for his status.  But by the end of the day he became one of the more responsive and responsible group leaders I had.  So I trained a new group leader on saturday, which is definitely something.<br>
<br>
Back to the subject at hand, all I can figure is, go with a proven value as much as you can.  If you have to accept pickups/newbies, try to distribute them evenly throughout all the groups, so that they can't all screw up together in one group.<br>
<br>
Fear is not very forgiving though, so even one careless person can result in a lot of headaches.<br>
<br>
Worth noting, btw, that Spinechiller spiders seem to be able to see through invis SOME of the time, but not ALL the time.  Perhaps it's level dependent in their case, I don't know.  At any rate, DON'T have people zone in when there's a spider at the portal!  /grin <p><div align="center"><font size="2">Aragir Lancot<BR>

<br>
Since this is a thread about breaking Fear, I think I'll mention that if I had a mix of experienced/proven and inexperienced/unproven people, I'd probably put the pickups/newbies with maybe one experienced person to tell them what to do and answer questions, but probably send some experienced groups in without them to do the break, unless we simply couldn't handle it without everyone.<br>
<br>
If my intent was to teach them how to break fear, or if I *absolutely needed* their assistance with the break, the then maybe I'd do what you suggested and spread them around.<br>
<br>
The principle here is that it really only takes one person to screw up a Fear break.  Spreading pickups/newbies around to every group means that someone in every group has a chance of screwing it up. <p><BR>

Since it was mentioned...<br>
<br>
The tree referenced is the tree on the west wall, right?   Just to the north a touch, where you have to go around a big corner?<br>
<br>
If, for some insane reason, I was going to break the zone with 1 group.....What would i need?  My guess is:<br>
<br>
55 mininimum, prefere 58-60 people<br>
<br>
1 Cleric - need heals<br>
1 Enchanter - need mez<br>
1 Warrior - need damage and tank<br>
1 Paladin - can't tank, needs to cast HWoP &amp; CC<br>
1 Rogue - damage<br>
1 ??  evacer? - In case you want to evac?  or better another?<br>

You'd want the levels to be pretty much all 60. The mobs aren't too bad just high aggro. All 60s would reduce aggro radius dramatically. I don't think you'd get near the amount of mobs on you.<br>
If you can get in when fear is cleared and just pull repops it's actually a valid xp zone with pretty nice gem and pp drops.<br>

When we zone in as all 60s, the zone seems so tame, nothing like I remember it from the old level 50 days.<br>
<br>
Then one time we had someone bring in an alt that was much closer to level 50. All of a sudden we got a lot more agro than I was used to seeing in at level 60. Your level definitely affects agro radius, and there is no place where it makes a bigger difference than in fear.<br>
<br>
A group of level 60s can go in and never have more than 4 or 5 mobs in camp at the same time. A group of 50s doing identical things will have 20+ mobs in camp, just due to their larger agro radius.<br>
<br>
Plenty of people have talked strats above, so I wont go into that, but keep in mind that a lot of the people posting are level 60, so when they say something about agro, keep in mind they might be thinking about level 60 agro, and not the agro you will get with your group. The camp gets the agro of the lowest level person there, no matter the level of the rest of the people.<br>

I helped get someone's corpse the other night in a very small group (someone had gone LD the day before during a CT raid and got back and died the next day).<br>
<br>
I brought my baby 53 bard instead of my paladin. We had a shaman to slow, an enchanter to help mez (though it wasn't neceessary) and only 1 or 2 other people (the naked person we needed the corpse for and a necro to summon).<br>
<br>
The enchatner and shaman tashed/malo'd everything and I kept 'em all mezzed with just my baby bard. I could easily keep 3 iced at a time myself for no maan cost - when we wanted to kill I charmed one and sicked it on another.<br>
<br>
We only killed 6 or 7 MOBs since we had no desire to farm armor, but the break-in was clean. We could have easily added more and cleared if we'd wanted.<br>

Do not send your level 47 cleric in for break just because he can CH.<br>
<br>
You *really* need an enchanter for crowd control in the first few minutes of the break.<br>
<br>
For Tunare's sake, do NOT try anything but a West Wall break. I have been on uncounted &quot;janitorial&quot; Fear raids, clearing the zone just to make our way to the north wall to rez a hapless prior raid from an inexperienced raid party. If you have done the zone enough times to feel comfortable trying a north wall break, then maybe consider it... but I still believe a west break is the best.<br>
<br>
If Cazic Thule, or any of the three golems (Fright, Terror, Dread) are up,... then do NOT use feign death pulling tactics. 90% of the mobs in this zone roam, and they are all &quot;social&quot;. They pass aggro to each other. FD does not erase this passed aggro. Its only a matter of time before you end up dealing with repeated rezzes of your pullers due to Death Touch. Just send out a puller and whatever they aggro, bring it all to camp and mez. You will save a lot of time on rezzing and rebuffing pullers that way.<br>
<br>
For the break groups, you wont need a shaman for slows. Mobs simply wont last that long. You need all the damage output you can muster.<br>
<br>
Lastly, do not be too proud to ask for help if the shit hits the fan. If you wait two hours after a wipeout to try and get assistance on CR from another guild, you are gonna have to face eating a LOT of full exp loss deaths.<br>

You dont even need to have an enchanter to break it this way.<br>
<br>
Pulling is easy without an enchanter too, just use the kiting method I posted above.   Granted, its slow, but it gets the job done.   I cant count multitude of fear raids we did pre kunark this way.  no monk, no enchanter, just a paladin with some balls and a pair of Jboots :P<br>
<br>
West wall is for more powerful forces.  You get alot of add's when you break west wall, although its much quicker then a north wall break.   North wall breaks take alot of time to get everyone in there, and everyone resed, but you end up fighting only 1 or 2 mobs at a time using the pulling method above.<br>
