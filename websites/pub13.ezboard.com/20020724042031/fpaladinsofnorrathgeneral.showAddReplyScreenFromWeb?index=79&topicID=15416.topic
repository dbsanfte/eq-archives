(This is a general statement not necessarily to the discussion about getting paladins a 18sec mitigation disc)<br>
<br>
The challange paladins typically face on raids is controlling aggro while using group heals. For example one change I would like to see is reduce the recast time of HWoP. It would not change encounters drastically but avoid watching your group die in very rough aoes while you hope HWoP pops up again. The aggro that the spell generates is enough to curb the power of HWoP<br>
<br>
Coming back to the discussion about a 18-20sec avoidance disc, I am personally against it since it would simplify many fights. In high end raids, the toughest and battle winning challenge is keeping aggro on one tank and keep him alive.<br>
<br>
Here comes the difference between paladins and the classes that already have a 18-20 100% avoidance discs: We can gain aggro almost instantenously compared to the other classes. The same is true for SKs.<br>
<br>
Warriors, monks, rangers, rogues cannot immediately draw aggro from a dragon after the MT died. If they would be able to, then the battle winning need to keep the MT up and aggro controlled would not be required. The fights would get a lot less challenging. <br>
<br>
Currently when the MT dies unplanned, a bunch of folks die until a new tank can be successfully established. This makes the battles challenging and fun. That makes you proud when you can reestablish a new tank through the skill of everyone <br>
<br>
(paladin lay handing newly established tanks to give clerics time to get CH chain going again, druids spot healing, none warriors turning off attack to give warriors a chance to get aggro)<br>
<br>
Now lets give a paladins a 18-20 sec disc. MT dies and paladin in 5 seconds has fully aggro. Maybe 1-2 die till the paladin is up. With a avoidance disc the clerics would have 18-20 seconds to get the CH chain reestablished and the battle would easily be won. That is forever.<br>
<br>
Except for the ranger none of the other def disc classes can do anything to gain aggro faster than by just hoping. The paladin though compared to the ranger can tank Aary and NToV dragons semi well.<br>
<br>
Even if you do not establish a CH chain, each paladin with def disc up will give the raid a free 18-20 second well aggro controlled time to finish a mob. Fights like Klandicar or Sont would become so boring since 5 pals with our uncanny ability to hold aggro could totally negate the need to even heal the MTs.<br>
<br>
Pal 18 sec defensive would take out the zest of the game. <p>Senchy Solariatus <BR>

<br>
I'm not sure I understand your point here.  I agree that DA would be more useful to a monk in the given situation, but in theory they won't want the aggro.  We're supposed to get it, but as it stands now, we'd get squashed faster then the monk.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Personally I am against changes/improvement to classes that take the zest out of high end encounters or destroy the role of other classes. (This is a general statement not necessarily to the discussion about getting paladins a 18sec mitigation disc)&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree.  However, a ~10 second avoidance disc will not destroy anyones roll.  Warriors will stil be the main and preferred uber mob tanks, but we would move up to a feasable second option.  Without the ability to 1) Hold aggro and 2) Stay alive for ~ 10 seconds, we can't do that.  Any  of the other mentioned classes can.<br>
<br>
I do disagree on a point though.  It does not take the 'zeal' out of encounters, what it does is create a semi viable option.  Why should the *whole* raid have to fail if the warrior dies?  That's too much power put into one class.  I think the game *needs* another, weaker, yet viable, option out there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Coming back to the discussion about a 18-20sec avoidance disc, I am personally against it since it would simplify many fights. In high end raids, the toughest and battle winning challenge is keeping aggro on one tank and keep him alive.&quot;<br>
<br>
Relying on one tank is not challenging.  It is simply the *only* strategy due to the lack of options, namely the fact that the supposed second best tank, lack *any* ability to stay alive vs a uber mob long enough to get a CHeal chain going.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here comes the difference between paladins and the classes that already have a 18-20 100% avoidance discs: We can gain aggro almost instantenously compared to the other classes. The same is true for SKs.&quot;<br>
<br>
In exp groups, yeah.  It's not that simple to get the aggro when the main tank drops vs a uber mob.  Either way, I don't see anything wrong with it remaining possible, yet less effecient/likely, to still be able to win the battle without the big bad warrior.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now lets give a paladins a 18-20 sec disc. MT dies and paladin in 5 seconds has fully aggro. Maybe 1-2 die till the paladin is up. With a avoidance disc the clerics would have 18-20 seconds to get the CH chain reestablished and the battle would easily be won. That is forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it would not be easily won.  A paladin getting hit for 600 - 1k a pop is not an effecient tank.  You still want a warrior to get the aggro.  Both the warrior and Paladin *only* attack the mob for the 10 seconds that the Paladin is /disc'd avoidance, at the end of which, he DA's and the aggro will go back to the new warrior.  Then, you win.  It does not replace the warriors role.<br>
<br>
You realize, that it is probable, with our complacency, and the druids lack of, that they will become the new AoE healers.  Where is that going to leave you then?<br>
<br>
&quot;Currently when the MT dies unplanned, a bunch of folks die until a new tank can be successfully established. This makes the battles challenging and fun. That makes you proud when you can reestablish a new tank through the skill of everyone &quot;<br>
<br>
I guess.  It's not exactly my idea of fun.  Getting squished nearly as fast as a cloth wearing caster vs a uber mob was not what I had in mind for a plate wearing holy warrior.  Or, cowardly hitting DA to *ensure* that the cloth wearer gets smashed first.  Again, I have a different vision for a holy warrior, perhaps the ability to withstand 10 second sof punishment vs a uber mob like the other melees and hybrids?<br>
<br>
&quot;Even if you do not establish a CH chain, each paladin with def disc up will give the raid a free 18-20 second well aggro controlled time to finish a mob. Fights like Klandicar or Sont would become so boring since 5 pals with our uncanny ability to hold aggro could totally negate the need to even heal the MTs.&quot;<br>
<br>
That I will have to take your word on.  I find it hard to believe that it would work quite as well as you think it would.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I advocate a 10 second disc.  I'm not sure where the 18-20 sec came from.  That, I would agree, to be too powerful.<br>

<br>
Yes, immunities and 2 different times would indeed be powerful.  FOr a 10 second avoidance disc for ut to be balanced it would have to be on a 60 - 72 minute timer or so.<br>
<br>
However, while I am glad we have DA and should have gotten it, IMO, lets look at it for what it really is.  It's a selfish, &quot;save your own tail at the expense of others&quot;, spell.<br>
It does not allow us to tank, LoH, heal or do *anything* to save anyone else, let alone do anything significant on a raid.  You live at the expense of dumping aggro to someone else that is probably less equipped to deal with it.<br>

<br>
Current abilities are:  Ranger weaponshields for 20 seconds (72minute reuse) (and CAN grab agro when they want), but at the end, they die unless someone else can grab off them.  Monk cannot grab agro, but if they get it, for 8 seconds they can be immune to melee (60minute reuse) then FD (which is likely to be promptly broken by AE/rampage).  <br>
<br>
If paladins had e.g. weaponshield,  you'd have someone that is likely not next in agro (unless AE healing maybe on certain mobs) and thus requiring it to stay alive that can then grab agro,  have 20 seconds of melee immunity,  and cast DA near the end for a guaranteed get out (can't be hit to interrupt) from dropping down the agro list and 15 seconds &quot;grace&quot; for someone to taunt off...<br>
<br>
That would be a very powerful combined skill interaction exceeding anything any other class can do in that situation by some way...

<br>
<br>
Like I was saying, ~20 seconds is too much for Paladins.  10 would be enough.  However, I do agree that the combination has the potential to be a very powerful method of saving  a raid from dying to a bad situation (missed heal on MT).<br>
<br>
However, it is very risky.  If you DA a second or two too soon, the aggro won't go to the warrior and everyone gets smashed.  If you DA a second or two too late...well, you're dead and who knows what will happen.<br>
<br>
Do understand that I am not bashing Paladins or saying that the game is nearly unplayable for us as it was post RoK.  I just think a couple of improvements would make us *just right*.<br>
<br>
1) 10 second avoidance disc.  Put restrictions on it or whatever.  we should be able to stand as long as the rest of the melee and hybrids against uber mobs.<br>
<br>
2) Spell lines need a look at.  I think we need a more defining role in the buffing department, personally.  DV series needs an upgrade or something new needs to be put in.  I advocate adding an AC component and a small add to all reists component. (ie: BMB becomes 225 HP, 15 AC, 5sv all).<br>
Add the necro line of undead slows or an undead DS line.  Something...insert something useful.<br>
<br>
3) From the logic standpoint, better mititgation skill caps.  From the balance standpoints, its iffy.  Can take it or leave it.<br>
<br>
Both 1 and 2 would borderline too powerful, without crossing the line.  Just 1 *or* 2 *should* be done. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A> at: 5/3/02 7:21:00 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed Protector</span><br>  Posts: 461<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/3/02 10:21:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15416.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> i think what gilfalas stated pretty much speaks the best argument for it.<br>

yes we can't attack, but guess what, our refreshes in 10 minuites. it drops agro, but guess what? we're compeltely immune to EVERYTHING except death touch. for 18 seconds you can go afk, drink a pop, go romp the sack with the old lady (some of you haha) come back and you'll be sitting there.<br>

<br>
Correct.  The fact that it is unreliable makes it, inherently, not overpowering for Paladins to have.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;thats what you guys aren't getting. those discs do not let anyone tank jack shit, it's a get out of death free card, and thats EXACTLY what DA is. i listed each classes escape ability, look at the positives and negatives on each classes ESCAPE ability. they are very balanced.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, they can tank with those discs activated.  Does a monk or rogue stop dealing goldly damage?  Does a rangers spells stop working?  Does a bards mega helpful songs stop?  DA stops everything that we can do, and ensures that someone else takes the fall before ours.<br>
<br>
The fact is, DA is a general act of cowardice.  Ensuring anothers death to save oneself.  Avoidance does not ensure that the mob will leave you; it only makes keeping it on you much harder.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;each of those avoidance discs have negatives to them as well, LONG reuse, can still be hit from behind. can still be hit with spells, any of this getting through yet? &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct, so why is it such a 'sin' for a Paladin to have this as an option.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;i think what gilfalas stated pretty much speaks the best argument for it.<br>
<br>
everyones skipping over his post like it's the plague, cause they know he is right.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for pointing that out.  I read his post before he editted it and added that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;My guild has 15 Paladins at 59 and 60. Say we all have a 20 sec pary discipline. Properly executed our guild could kill Derakor the Vindicator with no healers. Her is how:<br>
<br>
Paladin 1 Stuns to aggro Derakor and activates Super Parry. He continues to cast stun non stop.<br>
<br>
Paladin 2 starts casting stuns when Paladin 1's third stun is off. After 18 Seconds of Paladin 1's Disc, Paladin 2 activates HIS Super Parry and Palaind 1 DA's, transferring aggro.<br>
<br>
Paladin 3 starts castubg stuns when Palaind 2's third stun goes off. After 18 Seconds of Paladin 2's Disc, Paladin 3 activates HIS Super Parry and Palaind 2 DA's, transferring aggro.<br>
<br>
You see what I am getting at? With 15 Paladins (and my guild has 15 level 60 Paladins now) if done right, we can tank a mob for 15 x 18 seconds or 4.5 minutes without a heal necessary. Keeping each one alive is simply really as the Paladins can LH themselves if need be.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, no more then 10 seconds would be approriate.  It ensures a CH chain can get going, whilst keeping aggro.  That's all.<br>
<br>
However, replace Paladin with rogue in that scenario.  Rogue 1 gets aggro, other rogues beging meleeing/backstabbing limitedly to control aggro.  Rogue 1 activates avoidance when neccesary.  Avoidance runs out and rogue 1 hides.  Rogue 2 then gets aggro and avoids, etc.<br>
<br>
With the backstabs going on and better damage output in general, the mob drops much faster then in the Paladin scenario.<br>
<br>
The rangers will have a harder time executing that scenario if the fire based jolt is resisted, but it may be doable.<br>
<br>
There ya go, now you don't need Paladins on raids anymore.  Thanks for the new strategy.<br>
<br>
Heck, if we're going that route, why not just bring 16 mana burn wizzies along?  You'll have even better results with less effort and timing.<br>
<br>
Heck!  You can tank him for 4.5 minutes with 2 warriors and 5-6 clerics.  Do the job with 16 people or 7?  I'll take door number two, Bob.<br>
<br>
Now, consider that I ask for a 10 second avoidance disc and you get: 2.6 Minutes.<br>
<br>
Now you can do that with 1 warrior and 5-6 clerics.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if people actually had timing as good as what was needed to pull that strategy off, taking lag, etc into account, then you have one l33t set of friends.  The problem with that strategy is, one mistake and it all falls apart.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you see now why our COMBINATION of spells and skills, when adding in a warrior type defensive Discipline would be completely unbalanced?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't consider this a warrior type defensive discipline.  I consider this an &quot;every melee and hybrid, except the defensive hybrids&quot; disc.<br>
<br>
I still don't see the imbalance.  But, hey, if you guys really don't this we deserve it, then so be it.  If no one is going to support this, then it really does not matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;(and my guild has 15 level 60 Paladins now)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess a congratulations is in order.  Not many guilds can match the kind of power yours most likely has, particularly in the arena of warriors.  Consequently, wouldn't it be nice if tier 2 guilds could do anything of consequence without the all-mighty warrior?  Nah, that would be unbalancing.<br>
<br>
<br>
We'll just have to wait a few months until after the caster balancing, where we will be playing catchup again for the next year or so, all over again.<br>
<br>
Expect a preist or two to gain similar or better AoE healing power and enjoy DAing whilst everyone else *tanks*.<br>

<br>
Most other classes mainly use their defensive to escape, because most of the time they aren't tanking. Knights do tank, but if you consider DA their defensive, they can't tank with it (only escape).<br>
<br>
Here's what I think people are trying to get at:<br>
When Lordgoofydragon (don't know if this is a good example, but I like saying it) decides he's going to finish off a rogue after finishing of a warrior. With his defensive, the rogue can buy the raid 10 seconds + however longer he can survive, to get things back under control. That's about 10-15 seconds where no one is dieing.<br>
<br>
If a paladin finds herself the victim of Goofydragon, and she used DA or the /disc, she isn't buying the raid any time since now LordGoofy is going to turn his attention to someone else. In otherwords, people are still dying in those 18 seconds.<br>
<br>
While this may be acceptable for some classes (clerics for example), it really shouldn't be considered the 'defensive' for the games second best tanks.<br>
<br>
I'm curious, Gilfalas, how many clerics+warriors does it take to tank Derakor the Vindicator  for 4.5 minutes? If that number is &lt; 15 then this would seem like a far trade off. X number of well coordinated knight classes taking no damage, could be a viable second option to X-Y total number of clerics and warriors taking damage but healing it up. If not, then the length of the disc could be reduced (10-15 seconds?), so that would be a possible strategy, but definately not the best one.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/3/02 11:25:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15416.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmmm</span><hr size=1> Thanks Cylria.

<br>
The whole real point here is that if you make Warriors useless or unnecessary then you have made them useless and unnecessary and that is BAD.<br>
<br>
If you make Paladins and SK's nearly as usefull and necessary (which if I read this thread right is what folks are asking for) then your STILL not going to be used because the HORDES of warriors readily available on any server will STILL be more usefell and 'efficient' than we are.<br>
<br>
So, you would need to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> as</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> efficient as a warrior in order to be a truly viable reaplacment <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> for</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a warrior. And, again, once your as efficient as a warrior you, again, no longer need warriors since at that point we would be them with spells. And of course removeing warriors from any role besides damage dealer is bad. It is a catch 22. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105286"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~pfichera/Junk/sigfile.jpg" width="368" height="152"></a><br>

Btw as for those complaining about pallies get ressing spells, pallies had 90% rez capability since kunark. They only added the smaller versions in, so it did not matter much. It just helps the clerics lose less exp when pallie tries to save the raid.<br>

<br>
I think for the most part we are balanced offensively.  We dont do near as good as good as damage, but Verant has ensured that we get the best weapons in game to assist with our damage output.  Any melee class would love to be able to duel weild a few 24/22 1hs weapons.<br>
<br>
Defensively, we could use a little twinking in the uber encounters only.  For the most part I can tank any mob in game given the same support a warrior gets (cleric/chanters), except for uber mobs like gods or dragons, and actually require less support than a similar equipped warrior would need (we require less healing, faster regen).  A small twink to our defensive disc would prolly be the simplest answer.  However, the tradeoff for being able to tank better than a warrior on normal exp mobs vs being able to not tank on uber mobs may actually make us balanced defensively.   <p><BR><p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#CC0000" size="2"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=93296" target=Qualtar>60th Level Dwarven Knight</a></font></p><BR><img src="http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/247/83/32478348.gif"><BR><SELECT>
