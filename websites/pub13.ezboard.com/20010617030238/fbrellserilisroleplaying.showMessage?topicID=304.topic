I lifted my pick and began wearily swinging at the rock in front of me, muscles honed from years of hard labor rippling in the hot sun. My anger simmered unceasingly, at the Orcs, whom I hated with unbending ferocity, at the Gods, for their capricious cruelty, and at myself, for having failed yet again in my escape attempts.<br>
<br>
  This life, of whips and picks and pain and hunger, was the only life I could truly remember. The tattoo on my face was my only proof that I had ever had a life beyond the slave pens. I must escape, and discover from whence I came, if I had Clan or family in this world. To be free, unshackled, never again forced to fight in the Arena (where I had become a master of all weapons, sharp and blunt) for the Orcs amusement, to breathe air not tainted with the stench of fear and blood and sweat! <br>
<br>
  As I swung mindlessly at the rock, my pick head shattered on an unusually hard stone. Glancing furtively about, I slipped the stone and a few shards from the pick into my tunic. A plan began to form in my mind.<br>
<br>
  That evening, and for many evenings after, my trusted friend and cellmate Jookiee, a pickpocket (to my endless amusement, he insisted he was a &quot;Rogue&quot;) laboriously sharpened one of the pick shards on the unusually hard stone I had found, until he had fashioned it into a rudimentary lock pick. I too kept busy, fashioning a crude knife from another shard. We then decided that tonight we would attempt to escape, or die trying. <br>
<br>
  At the rising of the shadowed moon, Jookiee unlocked our shackles, and those of our other 3 cellmates. I crept to the cell door, ears straining for the slightest sound. Hearing nothing unusual, I silently swung it open. The four of us crept silently past the cells, ears pricked for the slap of Orc feet on stone. We reached the small stream that meandered through the slave camp undetected, and slipped silently into the water. Slowly, so as not to leave a ripple upon the water, we began to swim towards the gate. Our path would take us perilously close to the Castle, where the Emperor himself lived!<br>
<br>
  As we approached the small bridge that led to the Castle entrance, I spied 2 Orc Legionnaires standing guard on the bridge. There was no other way to go; they must be silenced without rousing the entire camp! Using the hand sign that was common among the slaves (unbeknownst to the Orcs) I signaled for the trusty Dwarf Baldinger to take the Orc closest to us, while I fought the second. We swam under the bridge, and waited, praying that we would not be discovered!<br>
<br>
  A moment came when both Orcs turned their backs, and we sprang into action. Pulling myself onto the bridge with one hand, I swung my crude knife with all my might, and pierced the Orc through the throat. With my other hand, I fought to keep his mouth covered, lest he scream and bring doom upon us! Baldinger had taken his shackles and chains, and leaping upon the back of the other Orc, twisted them about its throat in a death grip. Our other companions quickly came to our aid, and held the Guards silent and immobile until they were dead. We eased their bodies down into the river, and placing our hated shackles upon them, watched with grim satisfaction as they sank to the bottom of the river. Now for the last of it!<br>
<br>
  We scurried along the edge of the wall, like ghosts of long dead warriors, keeping always to the shadows, ever alert for the slightest hint that we had been discovered. Suddenly a great clamor arose from before us! My heart ceased its beating, and I was sure we were discovered! Peering out from the shadows, I saw a host of people engaged in furious battle with the Orcs. This was our chance! We sprang from the shadows, and ran for the exit tunnel. As we neared the skirmish, I spied a fallen warrior, and seized a mighty sword from his cold grasp as I ran past. He would not need it anymore, whereas I surely would.<br>
<br>
  We rounded the last bend before the tunnel, and could see that all of the guards had left to join in the fight. We ran as fast as our feet would carry us towards the exit, towards freedom, towards the beginning of life! Without warning, Baldinger gave a curious gasp, and fell on the ground before me. I stooped to lift him, and saw to my horror the arrow that had pierced his heart! Arrows began whistling past me, so I leapt up and continued running. I felt searing pain as an arrow pierced my side. As I ran, I broke the shaft off near the skin. To stop now would be to surely die!<br>
<br>
  The three of us burst out of the tunnel and into the surrounding woods. Shouting at us to follow, our Wood Elf companion Leiola sped through the trees with ease I could only marvel at. The Orcs were pursuing us; I could hear their shouts very close behind! Without warning, I emerged from the trees and collided with a warrior, a Wood Elf, who was guarding a curious device. Leiola dragged me onto the platform, and to my amazement, we began to ascend into the sky! Peering over the edge, I saw with great satisfaction that the Wood Elf guards had slain the pursuing Orcs. Glancing at Jookiee, I smiled, and then slumped unconscious upon the platform. <br>
<br>
  I woke to the most curious of sounds. For many minutes, I listened in puzzlement to what sounded like laughter. As memories of our escape flooded my mind, I realized that the sound I heard was indeed laughter, the laughter of small children at play. Distant images flitted through my mind, of my own childhood, long forgotten. A vivid picture of a snow-covered mountain came to me, then was gone. Surely this was an image from my long lost past. <br>
<br>
  Glancing around the room, I realized I was in a new world, one with which I was totally unfamiliar. I seemed to be in, or perhaps on, a large tree. There were green boughs above, fashioned into a roof. All about me were items fashioned from wood and stem and leaf. These people seemed to have a deep love for all things of the plant world. <br>
<br>
  A quiet knock sounded upon the door to my room, then the door swung open and a small man entered the room. I recognized him as a Wood Elf, from my acquaintance with Leiola. Without preamble, he began to speak:<br>
<br>
  &quot;I see you are awake! Good, good, I knew you would recover. The wound was deep, but we have many skilled healers. Leiola tells an amazing story, of being captured by Orc Slavers, and of your escape. Glad are we to have him back among us! And glad are we to welcome a Barbarian to our home. Not many travel this far from the Frozen North to our lovely woodland home. Rest now, and when you feel ready, join us in the Great Hall for song and food and drink and the telling of stories!&quot;<br>
<br>
  With that, he bustled out of the room, leaving the door open behind him. Gentle breezes lush with the scent of Evergreen and new spring grass wafted through the open door.<br>
<br>
  Hearing a giggle, I glanced to the window. Three small faces peered in at me with great curiosity. The boldest of them addressed me:<br>
<br>
  &quot;Are you a Giant? I’ve heard stories of Giants in the Great Hall. Surely you must be one; none of us are so tall as you!&quot;<br>
<br>
  Making a grim face, I growled in my best Giant voice: &quot;Arghh, a Giant I am, and a hungry one at that. Perhaps I shall eat you!&quot;<br>
<br>
  With a squeal of laughter, the children ran from my window.<br>
<br>
  I rose from my bed, and cast about for my clothing. Draped across the only chair in the room was a set of the finest leather armor I had ever beheld. As I examined it, I realized it was meant for me; no Wood Elf I had ever met was seven feet tall, as I was. With a sigh of satisfaction approaching pleasure, I donned the armor. It was well crafted, supple but strong, with reinforced joints and steel boning throughout. A Master Tailor had fashioned it, to be sure. The sword I had taken during my escape was leaning against the chair. I grasped it firmly in my hand, and began to examine it. Strange runes were wrought into the blade of a kind I had never seen, and a single white jewel that blazed with the colors of the rainbow was set firmly into the pommel. The guard appeared to be made of Gold, and the blade of Mithril. What a treasure I had found! I slung the sword across my back (it was quite large, a two handed variety of weapon) and proceeded out the door to explore this strange new world I found myself in.<br>
<br>
  I was standing on a large wooden platform that was suspended from the surrounding trees. All about me I could see similar platforms, with ramps and bridges connecting them. Many Wood Elves, as well as other Races. were all about, intent on their own business. None gave me a second glance. Walking to the edge, I peered down. Whoa, that would be a nasty fall! I was a good fifty feet above the earth! I marveled at the genius that it took to build such a city, a city in the trees.<br>
<br>
  A gentle hand pulled me firmly back from the edge. Turning, I saw a young man of approximately my age, a Wood Elf, fair of face and form as are all of their race. He spoke in a kind and humorous voice thusly:<br>
<br>
  &quot;So, just looking, or considering trying your luck at flying?&quot;<br>
<br>
  With a chuckle, I replied: &quot;Just looking. This is my first time in your fair city. Truly amazing it is!&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Allow me to introduce myself. I am Arkwen, a Druid by trade. The Master sent me to guide you to the Great Hall, and to answer any questions you may have.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well met, Arkwen. I am Klug, a former slave, and trained in the art of Weapons and -cough- mining.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Aye, well met Klug. What is your desire?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Can you tell me what has become of my companions?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, having been assured that you were well, Jookie has begun the long journey to his home in Rivervale. Leiola has rejoined his family up on level three, and your other companion has mysteriously disappeared!&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;No surprise there, Arkwen. Talsin was always a mysterious one. Claimed to be a Wizard, from across the world. The shackles they used on us prevented those with the gift of magic from casting spells of any kind. Now that he is freed, I'm sure he has gone to seek his home. I wish him well!&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;So, all is well and good then. What would you do now?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, truth be told, I am quite hungry!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a laugh, Arkwen replied: &quot;Follow then, and I will show you our great city as we proceed to the Great Hall.&quot;<br>
<br>
We began a leisurely stroll across the city, up and down wooden ramps, and across small bridges that swung rather disturbingly with our weight. We came to a small building, from which the most tantalizing of smells was emanating. Much to Arkwen's amusement, I was too large to fit through the door! He went in, and returned shortly with 2 small items, which appeared to be some type of biscuit. He gave me one, and I took a small experimental bite. Arkwen's laughter pealed across the platform at the look of astonishment on my face. I quickly devoured the remainder of this curious and wonderful biscuit.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Never had a pastry before, I take it?&quot;<br>
<br>
  With a grin, I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth, and replied: &quot;Nay, the Orcs fed us only hard biscuits, gruel, and water. Surely this pastry is made by the Gods!&quot;<br>
<br>
  With a chuckle, Arkwen replied: &quot;Oh, this is going to be fun! You are like a seven-foot tall child, to whom everything is new and wonderful! Well met, Klug!&quot;<br>
<br>
  Still chuckling, he said: &quot;Let us continue our journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
  We arrived at last at the Great Hall. Many of the Elders of the race were gathered there, as well as travelers from across the world. Folk were drinking, and singing, and telling stories. Small gatherings were intently discussing various topics. Arkwen steered me through the Hall to a serving counter, where he purchased what I came to know (and love) as Mead. With a warning as to its affects, we proceeded across to a white-haired Wood Elf. Bowing low before him, Arkwen introduced me to the Elder.<br>
<br>
  &quot;So Klug, what would you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
Admiring his direct manner, and the look of wisdom in his ancient eyes, I instantly trusted this man as I had few before.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I would know from whence I came, as my past is shrouded in darkness to me. I would know of where we are, and of the wider world around me. I would know all that can be known of weapons, and war, and strategy. And most of all, I would know how to make those wonderful pastries!&quot;<br>
<br>
A light, of humor perhaps, gleamed in the wise old man's eyes. In a solemn voice he replied:<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah, mysteries and knowledge, a true seeker! Of that most marvelous concoction, the pastry, seek out the Baker, she will teach you the ways of the pot and spoon. Of weapons and war and strategy, I cannot help you. Seek out the Warrior Guild Master for answers to those questions. However, as to your origins, perhaps I can help.&quot;<br>
<br>
  He rose, and peered intently at the tattoo upon my face.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Have you any other marks or tattoos?&quot;<br>
<br>
  I removed my breastplate, and showed him the rather ornate tattoo upon my chest. He peered intently for a minute, then turned to his bookshelf. He removed several volumes, and began flipping through them, muttering under his breath the whole time. After what seemed an eternity, he finally turned to me and spoke:<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, no direct reference to your exact Clan markings can I find, They bear a strong resemblance to the Clan markings of the Lake Rathetear region, but are subtly different. More I cannot tell you. Seek out the Barbarians who dwell upon the edge of the Lake. Perhaps they can be of more assistance.&quot;<br>
<br>
  I resolved to find this Lake, and to pursue the mystery of my origins, at the earliest opportunity. Thanking the Elder, Arkwen and I returned to the serving counter for another Mead.<br>
<br>
  &quot;So Klug, what will you do now?&quot; inquired Arkwen.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I must journey to the Lake and seek out the Barbarians.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well then, we must prepare you for your journey!&quot;<br>
<br>
  With that, we left the hall, and traveled to Arkwen's home. Over the course of the following days, Arkwen purchased many items; backpacks, a compass, journey bread named &quot;Iron Rations&quot;, flasks of water, and a Greater Lightstone. All the while, we chatted, about our lives, the city, the Wood Elf war against the Orcs, and the different cities and continents of Norrath. A deep and lasting friendship was forged during those days, as we continued to prepare for my long and arduous journey. Much to my surprise, the unusually hard stone I had found turned out to be a Diamond, a stone of great worth. I was able to sell it to an adventurer, and repay some of what Arkwen had spent on my provisions and gear. I never did discover who had fashioned the leather armor for me. When questioned, Arkwen would only reply &quot;it was a gift, from a kind soul. Let it be&quot;.<br>
<br>
  At last all preparations were complete. We descended the lift, and stood for a moment on the grass. I found I had a curious reluctance to part from my new found friend. With a sigh, I squared the pack upon my shoulders, and turned to Arkwen.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well my friend, the time for me to leave has come. I wish you a long and happy life!&quot;<br>
<br>
  With his ever-present grin, Arkwen replied &quot;Well met Klug! I wish you well upon your journey. Some day, when you least expect it, I will be there at your side again! Until then, my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
  With that, I turned, and set my foot upon the road to Felwithe. Many years would I travel, and many adventures would I have, before our paths would cross again. But that is a tale for another telling!<br>
