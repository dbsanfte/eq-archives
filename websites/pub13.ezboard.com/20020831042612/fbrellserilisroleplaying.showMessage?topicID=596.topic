I was hardly used to such cool tempatures and never had I seen such darkness during the day..every day. It was actually starting to depress me.. and I had only been here 3 days. <br>        I had lived out all of my life living in the beautiful oasis of Marr, with my father, a half elf by the name of Silloniar. Now that I had become of a mature age, he and I set off on a journey to my mother's homeland. I was to go study to become a ranger. I was already familiar with such things as hiding and sneaking and foraging. I tried to talk to the animals around the desert and oasis, but had little luck. They always found me more appealing as lunch rather then a friend. <br>I'm lucky I lived, for I knew nothing of defending myself. <br>       As my father and I arrived to Kelethin, we met up with my mother,  Lisselle. She invited us to stay at her tree-top home..and although my father was rather reluctant, for he has a great fear of heights, I talked him into staying with mother. <br>       I got my things unpacked, what few things I had that is, then set off to wander around the tree-top village. I stopped into the rangers guild hall, in hopes of meeting my new trainer, but He was gone on a quest. I then wandered around greeting the residents, thats when I heard enormous cheering coming from the tavern I was passing. I was very curious as to what was going on inside, so I poked my head inside the door and seen a hugh crowd of elves all clustered around one very handsome elf. I could'nt take my eyes off this elf, he was beautiful, and his singing was incredable! He was singing a well known elf favoriate called &quot;The time I fell out of my house&quot;. He was strumming on a banjo as he cheerfully sang. I found myself a seat as close as I could get to where the handsome bard stood and sat. I then stood back up, for I couldnt see him from the seat, and climbed up on the table instead, there I sat, cross legged, watching and clapping my hands with the tune. <br>       After the song was over, and the other elves had finished their long applause, I worked my way through the crowd and smiled up at the bard. He said to me &quot;Hello there, young lady!&quot; he smiled back, and ohh what a warm smile it was, it sent shivers down my spine. &quot;What is thy name&quot; he asked. &quot;Lynnie, my lord.&quot; I replied. &quot;Glad to meet your aquaintance Lynnie&quot; he bowed. &quot;I am known as Issus, but I usually go by Ussa.&quot; <br>       Issus and I talked for many hours that night. He told me of his journeys around the world, the people he has met and all the new songs he learns from those adventures.  I begged him to share one with me. &quot;Ahh, I would love to share all of my songs with you Lynnie, but they are very detailed and would take you numerous days to learn, but I do know of one I can teach you, if you sing it from the heart, it will make you stronger and faster.&quot; &quot;Teach Me!!&quot; I begged. And so he did just that, and from that night on, I have been a Bard! <br>       I went back to my mothers that night after many drinks and a long conversation with my new friend, and shared my song with my family. They felt the effect of my song just as I did.. it was truely amazing. I had not only memorized the song in a matter of hours, but had a gift for singing! They both instantly agreed that I should be sent to the Bardic Hall rather then to go off trying to become a ranger. <br>       That next day, I took 10 platinum pieces with me to the Bard Hall and bought a nice lute. They showed me a few notes, but said I must first focus on my singing. After a few weeks I had become an excelent singer and started learning to play my lute. Another month later, I was able to play and sing, and the effects of the songs were truely amazing! <br>       One night, while practicing my lute and songs at my mothers home, there was a knock at the door. &quot;Are you expecting company?&quot; my mother asked me. &quot;Nay, mother.&quot; I quickly got up to see just who it was at the door at this late hour, and as soon as I opened the door, my father nearly went into shock. <br>       It was a tall, blonde, human standing in front of me. She smiled down at me, looked at my father and said &quot;Hello Father, I have finally found you.&quot; My father ran to the door and grabed this human in a tight embracing hug. I was extremly confused. How could this human be the offspring of my half elven father?! And why was I never told about her?! <br>       My father quickly invited the human in. He looked directly at me and said &quot;Maybe you should sit down Lyn, I think I have some explaining to do.&quot; I sat down, still confused and very curious. &quot;This is your half sister, Dande. I met her mother on one of my trips to Freeport, about 10 years before you were born. Her mother found me quite appealing at the time and took it upon herself to follow me into town from North Ro. She followed me back home, and I invited her in for a drink, and that was when she decided I would take her to my bed. She stayed with me for a year or so, taking it upon herself to feed herself with my food and sleep in my bed.. and kick me out of it when she didnt want me there! I was'nt very happy about the situation, so I asked her to leave. I didnt know at the time that she was pregnant, otherwise I would have let her stay. Anyways, I was told a few years later that she had given birth to a baby girl, but was then visciously killed by one of the guards of the Freeport Militia in East Freeport. I always assumed they had killed the baby as well.. but then some years back I was told that one of the priests from Temple of Marr witnessed the brutal killing and snatched the baby up off the ground and raised it to be of the priesthood. Thus we have now, your sister, a Knight of Marr.&quot; <br>     I was astonished! How could he go on not ever telling me about my half sister! I never liked humans much, I thought they were filthy and usually dumb, but this one they claimed as my sister didnt seem to be either..luckily. <br>     I talked to my new-found sister, Dande, the rest of the night. I played and sang for her, and she showed me her massive weapon collection, which she took with her everywhere. I dont know how she could stand to carry so much weight around with her all the time.. but I guess one gets used to it after awhile. I went to bed early the next morning, just as the sun was rising. It is easy to sleep in Kelethin during night and day, since it never gets much light in the sky. I slept peacefully that day, wondering what else I would come to learn tomorrow.... <br><br><br>Lynnie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=596.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=596.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=596.topic><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=596.topic><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/del1.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=596.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=596.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm70">News and Events<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">The Outer Realm (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm73">New User Interface<option value="brellserilisfrm56">The Hall of Honor<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">The Fellowship of Guilds<option value="brellserilisfrm53">The Valley of Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm72">Ickhor's WC3 house<option value="brellserilisfrm66">The Back Alley (Link to Rants)<option value="brellserilisfrm71">Raids: Discussion<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (BUYING)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Selling and Trading)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">Spells, Research and Gems</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
