<br>
Sorry for the very general topic, but I retired from EQ just beofre Kunark hit the shelves. I played Dark Age of Camelot for a while, but I've started to become frustrated with the paladin class there (they're great in PvM, but they are awful in Realm Vs. Realm combat, which is THE high level game).<br>
<br>
Anyway, a good friend of mine has gone back to EQ and I'm curious what kinds of improvements have been made to the game that affect paladins. I've read some of the features that were added post-Kunark, but am curious to how paladins stand at this point. I do see that there are still some old-timers about who can remember back that far. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Changes have been numerous Romidar. I ma sure there are people who are more able than me to explain them, but I will answer in one manner. <br>
What have changed for me.<br>
<br>
I am an honnest damage dealer with my Fiery Defender. I can tank as I was able before Kunark. I am more deadly against Undead foes though. With a spell like Nife, I can imbued any weapon I am wearing to make it proc a DD vs undead. <br>
<br>
The other aspect of the paladin isnt bad too. We have access to more healing spell. At 58 there is a group healing realy decent and at 59 we have a realy good heal over time spell. <br>
<br>
And then there is the Alternante Advancement who allow paladin to develop there specificity a bit more.<br>
<br>
Verant was fair with Paladin since Kunark. Kunark saw our class in danger, but afterward, the changes were in the good direction.<br>
<br>
One thing I forgot. There is no more experience penalty at all. And, as I remember your weapon studies, now 2 Handed weapon are a viable way to fight.<br>
<br>
I know that other old timer will post a more complete resumé of our strength and lower points. But I shared what was my common life in Norrath now. <p><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief//nosfy01.jpg"><BR>Officer of The Phoenix Crusaders - Guild of Erollisi

I think the paladin is certainly one of the more rounded classes. Whether you are in raid type situations, groups, or solo you can hold your own to say the least. <p>Lestr Bonecrushr

I played well past Velious, but left the game last summer, before many paladin changes were introduced, and returned actively only about six weeks ago. I am still a semi-newbie sorting through the many paladin, and general, changes to EQ in that time, and many others can give you a more detailed response. But I have seen many changes for the better. I deal much better damage with my epic now (which is far from the best weapon out there now for paladins); raid buffed and hasted, I can see multiple 200+ hits on the same screen, which ain't bad. And we certainly hit better on red mobs than in the past. With the increased damage, and our 25% self only haste buff, we can solo reasonably now also. And the new level 58 group heal is just terrific (heals 594 on each group member). On raids, I am usually the main healer in my group, or in conjunction with another paladin or druid.<br>
<br>
BTW, I also played DAoC for a while, though not to very high level (about level 25). I am afraid I found the paladin boring, altthough quite a good soloer.  <p>Marlowe Lawbringer<BR>

Players that have followed the changes actively seek out paladins for groups. While we were flexible but weak before, we are quite capable tanks and casters now. There is a good amount of knight only gear that is very nice. To grasp the change to 2h damage, rangers are fighting with 2h weapons now against very high AC mobs (like everything in Luclin). Duel weapons is not always superior to 2h. We can tailor our flexibility to accent either of our parent classes. We have never been stronger and other classes are begining to notice it. Having said that, don't tell anyone and just enjoy playing a mostly balanced class.  <p><table border="0" width="41%">

<br>
As was previously stated; Paladins were somewhat left behind in the Kunark expansion... an undesired class in experience groups and in raids.  We did poor damage, could not heal very well, and could not match warriors for tanking ability.<br>
<br>
Several patches along with the last two expansions have worked to fix the disparity between the Paladin and our parent classes (Warrior and Cleric).<br>
<br>
Currently, Warriors and Clerics are still more desired on high-end raids (because of the Defensive Discipline, which reduces damage-per-hit by 40 percent).  However, the Paladin surpasses the warrior as a tank in experience groups due to being able to tank just as well, but in addition bringing healing and enchanter-support spells (like Root/Stun) to the group.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
Two-handed weapons were left in the wayside after Kunark's release.  Those of us using 2-handers could not keep up even a modest 40 percent of the damage of a duel-wielding class.  Recent changes have completely revamped and upgraded the two handed weapon damage (via the Damage Bonus), as well as added new Paladin-usable two handers.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
Instrument of Nife was added with Luclin.  Starting at level 39, we now can buff ourselves to proc 243 damage against undead.  Combine this with our Undead damage AA abilities, and we're actually quite formidable against undead.  Fortunately, there are multiple 50+ undead experience areas on Norrath now, such as Burning Woods, Howling Stones, and The Grey.<br>
<br>
As Nosfy said, our healing spells at 57+ are very valuable in any group.  Superior Healing allows for 500+ HP of healing on a single target.  Healing Wave of Prexus (58)  heals everyone in the entire group for 600 HP.  Celestial Cleansing lets a Paladin outdo even Superior Healing, with less mana, and a quicker cast time.  <br>
<br>
Paladins get stuns from level 15 on (instead of the 30), useful for quickly interrupting spellcasting.  We now have a line of Self-Only regeneration as well, and even a self-only 25 percent haste spell!<br>
<br>
Resist Disease was added after Kunark, but was pretty much useless.  Now with the release of Luclin, more diseased-based mobs have been introduced (for example, in the popular experience spot, Fungus Grove).<br>
<br>
Ressurection spells were upgraded recently as well.  Instead of Revive  (0% experience at level 49) and Ressurection (90% exp at level 59), we now have 5 or 6 resses, starting at 22, that restore increasing amounts of experience.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
With Alternate Advancement (AA), Paladins can increase any stat, mana/hp regeneration speed, total HP, summon a horse, do critical hits, and even maximize damage against undead.  With the Slay Undead (3) skill, some Paladins are doing nearly 5500 damage on critical hits versus undead.<br>
<br>
The Hybrid experience penalty was removed as well.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
So overall, here's where we stand:<br>
<br>
Paladins can come very near Warriors for HP/AC, and are just as good at tanking mobs that do less than 500 damage a hit.  Above 500 damage or so per hit, a Warrior with the defensive discipline is needed.<br>
<br>
Paladins can heal as well -if not better than- druids or shamen in the group... especially against mobs with AoEs (like dragons) due to our excellent group healing abilities.<br>
<br>
Paladins can once again do a respectable amount of damage with 2-handed weapons.<br>
<br>
Overall, we are finally getting close to that which we once were: versatile, damage dealing healer-tanks that can fill in for different positions in a pinch.<br>

Now two questions..  Race is still just personal choice, correct?  nothing has changed there?  I was thinking of erudite to be rare, but not sure.<br>

Server choice?  I have no friends/guild left in EQ so can pick any server to come and join. Anyone able to recommend a server for a  brand new incoming paladin <br>

Romidar! Welcome Back!!<br>
<br>
For those of you who dont know who Romidar is, he is basically the catalyst for all paladin changes and the classes' first advocate with verant.<br>
<br>
/salute my old friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway here are the changes.<br>
<br>
1. 2h weapins had their damage bonus increased tremendously.  While 1h stayed at 11, a 40 delay weapon now has a 34 damage bonus and the damage bonus goes up with delay.<br>
<br>
In otherwords paladin damage is alot better now.  On the other hand 1h weapons are now pretty much crap for paladins.<br>
<br>
2.  We have some amazing new heals.  One heal does 750 hp for 225 mana over 6 ticks.  Like a short uber regen.<br>
<br>
3. Another heal is group heal for 600 hp for 600 mana (great for mobs that cast ae damage spells).<br>
<br>
4. At 50 we have a 20 percent self only haste for soloing.<br>
<br>
5. We have 255 defense like warriors and can tank very well in exp groups.<br>
<br>
6. We have an Alternative advancement skill that allows us to summon a horse that runs at bard speed and one that allows us to do 4-5000 hp crits on undead.<br>
<br>
7. We have some new fast cast spell interupt spells.<br>
<br>
8. Top end paladin weapons are in the 53 46 range while average weapons are in the 30 35 range.<br>
<br>
9.  We have a 200-225 hp buff that stacks with everything.<br>
<br>
Over all we are a nice class now. Probably the best exp tank becuase of our ability to get agro wwith stuns and have a nice raid role with our increased damage and group heal.<br>
<br>
Well thats it off the top of my head.<br>

<br>
  I started my paladin as yours was waning.  A lot of the information and how to play a paladin was gleaned from your posts.  Alot of our current upgrade can also be traced to the time you took to understand how EQ's combat engine worked and how AC &gt;&gt;&gt; stats.<br>
<br>
  Others can sum up the high end raiding, which I have not done much of, but in the day to day exp grind and versus most non uber mobs we are legitimate tanks.  We have the mana pool, you might have left before we had our mana pool increased to being equal to clerics of the same lvl and wisdom (not 9 lvls below as we started out), and spells to be main healer in most exp groups at 59  as well.  2 Hand weapons now deal very respectable damage, and as it has been previously stated our group healing ability is very good.  <br>
<br>
  Through Alternate Advancement (AA), the ability to channel exp from the level bar into an alternate pool which you can use to round out your char as you see fit, and through a lvl 39 spell we are now the undead slayers that we should have been to start with.  Instrument Of Nife (IoN) is a 243DD proc.  Very little mana to cast and it seems to proc reasonably well.  Slay undead lvl3, which I will be working on as soon as I reach lvl 60, can produce massive damage against undead.<br>
<br>
  If you return you will prob find your once uber gear is now substandard lvl 20ish twink gear.  Except planar gear which is still decent.<br>
<br>
  Although most of the changes have been positive there are a few that have not.  No one quests Ro any more.  I spent 4 hours getting another 8 pieces of melatite for a newly returned lvl 20 paladin in our guild.  I prob could have killed giants in Lake Rathe and in less time gotten money to buy better equipment.<br>

For if the great ones, and I use the term loosely, that have left (Belduki, Romidar, Marlowe ect...) are now returning is there any hope of truly quitting this game ???? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhorammer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Horammer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/25/02 7:50:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15379.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://horammer.homestead.com/files/Horammer.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Changes to Paladins since right before Kunark?</span><hr size=1> One thing people have forgotton to mention is there are two new races that can be Paladins.<br>

<br>
In case some of the newer readers don't know Romidar was one of the elder Paladins that pointed out that in the pre-Kunark world stats sucked.  Through the use of log analsys and good old fashion logic he showed many what he noticed about the way the game performs.  At least that is what I remember...my memory is getting kind of fuzzy about those days. ^_^;<br>
<br>
In general, I'm somewhat pleased where Paladins exist in EQ.  Paladins still can't tank Lord Goofydragon(think: big high damage monster) like Warriors.  Paladins still can't heal like Clerics(or Druids or Shamans for that matter).  However we found ourselves a nice niche as the one class in EQ that can viably fight or heal (doing both at the same time is the tricky part ^_^).  It is a comfortable spot in the game I enjoy.<br>
<br>
As for what changes (I hesitate to call them 'improvements) have been since Kunark is quite a list.  Unless stated expicitly items refer to the +50 game.  In no particular order:<br>
<br>
- Changes to 2H damage<br>
It was noticed that 2H weapon performance in general didn't scale well at all.  The damage distribution was tweaked out so that larger damage, slow weapon don't get trounced by light fast weapons.  Of course this effected SKs and Paladins big time since we depend on 2H weapons more.  The side effect of this was that you'll now see Warriors pull out 2H weapons now that they are a viable source of damage.<br>
<br>
If you go for a 2H weapon try to keep its delay above 40 otherwise you'll be &quot;under the curve&quot; and stretching performance.<br>
<br>
- Changes to melee damage across all classes<br>
Everyone got retweaked!  Verant wasn't happy with the way damage was dealt so they shifted everyone up to the &quot;Warrior Damage Table&quot; and all classes got tweaked up or down a little accordingly.  The general net effect was good.<br>
<br>
- Lances and weapon selection<br>
Kunark dealt a huge blow to Paladin damage performance only offering a scant few choices let alone any good ones.  Velious came along return some of the better weapon options to fighting Paladins.<br>
<br>
SKs and Paladins were given &quot;Lance class weapons&quot; which are roughly large weapons that use piercing skill.  Interestingly enough the high end lances are very nice.<br>
<br>
- Casting performance<br>
Mana penalty is gone.  The same mana calculator used for Clerics, Druids, and Shamans can be used to calculate mana for a Paladin.<br>
<br>
Hybrids get a &quot;speed up&quot; in general post 50.  If the spell takes longer than 2 seconds to cast you'll notice a slight difference in the listed casting time and real casting time.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Hybrid Casting Penalty&quot; is gone as well.  In the middle of a fight, if you stopped to cast a spell you used to have reset your melee timer.  If your weapon's speed was 40 and you started casting a spell on tick 30, you would have to restart you next swing at 0!  This is somewhat nice for Paladins since healing spells usually take longer than a swing. ^_^<br>
<br>
So what do I think are the really nice stuff since Kunark?<br>
- Celestial Clensing<br>
The lowest stacking HOT but wow it is still so very nice! ^_^<br>
- Healing Wave of Prexus<br>
The best tool to keep your group alive and your Cleric happy in raid situations with a lot of damage being toss around. ^_^<br>
- Culmination of melee changes<br>
2H weapons are no longer clunky.  1H weapon choices for Paladins are workable.<br>
- AA skills<br>
Improve your casting ability, melee ability, and throw in a couple of nifty Paladin on specialities like Slay Undead and things get really interesting.  Too bad it is such a time sink. ^_^<br>
<br>
Poke around the boards and see what is going on.  There are issues but nothing so crippling like the dark days of Kunark for Paladins. <p><font size="+1">

<br>
I don't know if my character still exists out there on Xegony, though I gave away all of my items anyway. Might be fun to start over with all the changes in any case. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sounds like we actually get decent spells earlier now, and it would be nice to see what levelling is like with no experience penalty! Not sure what server I'll play on at this point - if Romidar still exists on Xegony, I may play a newbie on another server as well.<br>
<br>
I do notice that many people mention how helpful fiery avenger is, which is a bit of a concern (unless they've changed the method of getting it...). I'll browse the boards to try to get a picture of how much things have changed, but it sounds like there's enough reason to go out and get the game again (I assume that buying the most recent expansion is enough?).<br>
<br>
I have to say that one thing I missed in DAoC is being extra effective vs. undead. DAoC paladins are basically bards in plate. I miss being able to buff people at random, save people with lay hands, etc. I felt like more of a &quot;paladin&quot; in EQ than ever in DAoC.<br>
<br>
I also must say that one thing I never found in DAoC was the kind of community there is here - that may be the biggest draw of all. It is nice to know that there are people who remember me after this time, and it is a great pleasure to read the names of folks who worked on making the game better for paladins (it was, after all, a HUGE team effort - and not all of us were even paladins!).<br>
<br>
Now if my wife won't freak out when I start playing, I'll be set. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In the kunark days, the center thing in the day to day life of a pally would be was stuns.  In the Velious days with spell like CC, xp group were easier to convince to go adventures in more dangerous places withouth bringing cleric/chanter herited from the kunark mentality. After the 2hder upgrade, it became that now, I do my best to cast as little and as fast as possible in a battle, since swinging that lance actually do non negligeable dmg.<br>
<br>
Epic wise, paladins are kinda lucky I would say since Fiery Avenger/Defender is nice to get but it isn't the end of the world if you don't have it when you consider other options around ( some would say it's a proof that are epic need a upgrade *shrug* ).  I personnally never have gotten any dragon books and still managed and still manage to have lots o fun.<br>
<br>
If you come back with Romidar, you can pbly easily get a Centi warspear and Grodan Strengh to get restarted on yer feet.<br>

A true privilege and happy honor to have you back on the boards. :)  <br>
<br>
<br>
Change Summary (I will try and be complete):<br>
<br>
1) No more class based XP penalty.<br>
<br>
2) Mana is now computed on our wisdom and actualy level. (no more {level-8} mana pool).<br>
<br>
3) Swing timers are no longer reset when HYBRIDS ONLY cast spells. Meaning we can cast between melee swings if we time it properly and not lose combat damage.<br>
<br>
4) Offensive spells casting times are reduced for all hybrids after level 50. Spell 3 seconds or longer recive a .15? second per level past 50, casting time reduction. So at 60 a 3 second OFFENSIVE spell is cast in 1.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
5) Post 50 we have been moved UP to the warrior post 50 Damage table. We were previosly still on the pre 50 damage table for warriors.<br>
<br>
6) Gnomes and Halfling have recently been added to the Paladin classes. (/boggle)<br>
<br>
7) Our Defense skill (only) has been increased to the same cap as a warriors. (Not parry, riposte or dodge)<br>
<br>
8)   Our taunt cap has been raised to 200 at level 60.<br>
<br>
9) We receive our first rez spell at 22 and our first XP rez spell at 30 with increasingly better XP restored rez spells every circle, until we get our 90% XP rez at 59.<br>
<br>
10) We get an anti Undead spell at 30 which adds a 243 point proc to any attack.<br>
<br>
11) We have about 7 total stuns to work with now, including some very low level, VERY mana cheap ones.<br>
<br>
12) We get some very raid friendly heals at 55 and 58, Wave of healing (group 200 heal) and Healing Wave of Prexus (group 600 heal) respectively. Also Brells Mountainous Barrier at 60 which is a 2 hour? 225 point group HP buff that stacks.<br>
<br>
13) We get a self only 25% haste spell, Valor Of Marr, that lasts one half hour, at level 50.<br>
<br>
14) Two handed weapon damage has been modified to make it a VERY viable damage source when compared even to Duel Wielding, double attacking classes.<br>
<br>
15) Many more paldains weapons in the game with ratio's that make them decent, although there is still a problem with post 50, paladin only weapons being very rare and far between for 'non-high level guild' Paladins.<br>
<br>
16) Lay Hands has had it's healing upped, with a nice boost post 50. It is still not a Complete Heal, but does heal about 2500 at level 60 and with the new Alternate Advancement abilites can be permanently turned into a compete heal.<br>
<br>
17) Alternate advnacement allows us to improve MANY Aspects of our characters:<br>
<br>
We can buy up our base statistics up to 10 more points. <br>
We can buy increases to running speed and regen rates. <br>
We can add criticals to our characters: The ability to 'critical' on combat, healing, weapon procs and damaging spells.<br>
Increase our 'fear' effect resistance eventually making ourselves IMMUNE to fear.<br>
Increase our critical striking against undead to have a chance to do MASSIVE damage on them (Up to weapon damage x 100 on a max Slay Undead ability hit).<br>
<br>
And more effects.<br>
<br>
18)  Celestial Cleasning at level 59, a 750ish Heal over Time spell (24 seconds) that casts in one second. GREAT mana to heal ratio and fast casting lets Paladins actually solo blues. It is also great for healing in general, the only drawback being the 30 second recast timer on it.<br>
<br>
That is off the top of my head. I know I touched ground others have covered and am pretty sure I have touched a few others have not. There is more too. We have really come around. While we are still not perfect we are VERY VERY nice.<br>
<br>
I know in my guild they want as many Paladins as possible. If they had their way there would be a paladin in EVERY group for group healing.<br>
<br>
The only problems at high level (in my opinion, I am <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   sure</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> others will disagree) is the massive time investment and the need to have 45+ people to do any kind of raid content. It really gets wearing to log on and spend 4 hours killing one supermob night after night. The feeling of accomplishment goes away after the first 4-5 times and then becomes drudgery.<br>
<br>
Luckily Luclin added a LOT of high level single group content. Still exploring that so it may get better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   I'll browse the boards to try to get a picture of how much things have changed, but it sounds like there's enough reason to go out and get the game again (I assume that buying the most recent expansion is enough?).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I know they are selling an EQ/RoK/SoV 3 pack. But Luclin is still a solo sale item. It may be cheaper for you to just buy Velious and Luclin seperate if you still have EQ and Kunark.<br>
<br>
Community is a lot more on EQ because chat channels are more available on a mass scale. I always found DAoC to be very 'quiet' no Auction channel in 95% of the world, no shout, no OOC. No mass communication. In EQ I think that is one way that people now other people are out there.<br>
<br>
That does not happen in DAoC. I think that fosters a far more insular atmosphere there. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105286">Gilfalas Elaandrin</a>, Lvl 59 Knight of Tunare & Defender of Nature<br>

<br>
I used to remember your posts of parsed logs with you and your wife (Ranger I believe).<br>
<br>
Was a very sad day when you left us, for me anyway =).<br>
<br>
SO glad to see you back.  The paladin class has taken a 180 from where it was at kunark's inception.  Most of the imbalances have been corrected with paladin only spells and skills (whoa our  own stuff not watered down parent class things!)<br>
<br>
I think you will find the game much more interesting now =).  In fact, if you want to come over to Prexus (maybe not the wisest due to highend player base) I would be more than willing to help you out with some new insight, and probably some gear too =).<br>
<br>
You were a huge influence on how I play the game today, Id only want to pay back some of that debt.<br>
<br>
In short, paladins rock now, and I personally attribute a signicant part of that to you =).  <br>
<br>

I don't play on either server, but Sullon Zek (PvP) and Firiona Vie (Roleplay) looked interesting to me. If I hadn't already had a developed character on The Rathe I would have gone to one of those. Might be worth your while to look into the rule sets for those two servers.<br>
<br>
If you have to start over, and pick The Rathe, drop me a /tell and I'll try and help you out with some equipment. I was one of those small 20ish paladins that looked up to you so much pre-Kunark =) Great to have you back!<br>
