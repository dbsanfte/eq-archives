There are many tales that I haven’t included yet, and many more yet to be told.<br>
<br>
Kestri had heard of a quest for a great prize for a mistress of song as herself, but the quest was long and involved and filled with many great battles and dangers.  It was exactly the type of thing she was looking for during her journeys through the land.  Her recent acquisition of some of her armor from the realm of Hate had made her bold.  Many of her friends looked to her for answers now and as she helped them she grew a more and more outgoing.  But today’s undertaking had her feeling as nervous as a kitten again.<br>
<br>
She checked her map and looked at the sky, for the eighth time, trying to make sure she knew where she was going.  “Darn snowy lands, so hard to tell which way is up, let alone north.” She muttered as she crested a hill.  The side dropped quickly and as she wasn’t looking she tripped and rolled down, only saved from harm by the skills her rogue friends had taught her. When she stood again she realized that the map was blowing away.  Muttering under her breath she chased it across another hill.  But in the glare of the sun on the snow she lost track of it.  Moving with the wind she scouted around trying to see where it was carried.  After about five minutes she gave up and sat down on a hill, grumbling about fate.  <br>
<br>
“Is this what you are looking for?” a strong woman’s voice spoke behind her.  <br>
<br>
Kestri stood quickly, smiling for the voice sounded so much like Rhainanon her friend.  She looked at the woman behind her, and although she was a barbarian, that was where the resemblance ended.  But mostly in the way this woman held herself proud, but wary, like a warrior ready for attack at any moment.  She held the map in her hand.  “Yes, that is exactly what has caused me such distress.” Kestri joked.<br>
<br>
The woman handed over the map, but looked down at Kestri questioningly.  “You are a bard, are you not?”<br>
<br>
Kestri nodded and held out her hand and the strong woman shook it, “Kestri Luteusmaximus at your service milady.”<br>
<br>
“We don’t get many of you folk around these parts, unless you are searching for the Lady Vox.”  The regal barbarian looked down at her as if judging her merits by sight alone.  <br>
<br>
The bard smiled again, knowing that many had come before her on this exact same quest but not many would succeed, “She is exactly who I seek.”<br>
<br>
The woman then sat down on the hill.  “Sit here with me, I would like to know why you try to meet the icy dragon.”<br>
<br>
Kestri, enjoying the break from the search for the entrance to the caverns called Permafrost, sat next to her and gathered her thoughts. “Well, to be honest I am on a quest,” and being a bard and prone to waxing eloquent, “a quest of epic proportions.” The barbarian nodded and so Kestri continued. “It has been told that the Lady Vox will on occasion leave this earth to move to another plane when faced with a group of brave adventurers.  She will fight bravely, but if she cannot defeat them she will depart to return to her home at a later time, and when she does, she leaves behind items of great worth.  Many of those items are instruments like no other found on Norrath, but one of those items, left behind on a rare occasion, is a white dragon scale that can be used to create an instrument of such tone and beauty that all bards wish to possess it. And I am afraid, out of all the items I own, I would give most of it to earn an instrument such as that.”<br>
<br>
The barbarian woman pondered this for a moment and then spoke quietly, “I know of the quest you speak of, two of my friends have completed it and you are correct, the end result is astonishing, but I am not sure that the instrument will not be a surprise for you.” She had a bit of a smirk on her face as she spoke, as if knowing something the bard did not.<br>
<br>
Kestri’s eyes lit up as she heard this, “You have seen it then?” pausing before asking, “I have not.” And she sighed slightly eyes looking off as in a dream, “Is it a drum perhaps? Or maybe a beautiful lute inlaid with sparkling gems?”<br>
<br>
“It is all of those, and it is none.  You will see that when you earn it yourself. But this is a long and difficult quest you are on you know?”  The woman looked down at the bard who was half her size.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I know.  Only bards of great renown will complete this quest.  And I hope to add my name to that list someday.” Kestri smiled and looked to the woman, “You must be an adventurer of that type yourself, to know bards that own this instrument.”<br>
<br>
The woman smiled slightly and responded to the veiled inquiry, “My name is Sindarre Frostpaw and I have been known to complete a few quests myself.” She then stood and offered her hand to Kestri, pulling her easily to her feet.  “You should be off though, if you wish to meet the dragon soon.”  She handed Kestri the map and turned her in the right direction. “Go straight across here and you will cross two rivers then you will see a doorway guarded by the great ice giants, be careful as you pass through there, but that is the entrance to Lady Vox’s lair.”  She paused looking down upon the bard again, “I see a strength in you, and feel a strong kinship too.  Maybe one day we will meet again and I can hear some tales from you.  I have a feeling you have many to share.”<br>
<br>
Kestri looked up at the woman smiling, “I do have many tales and would be honored to tell them to you someday.  Please, look me up anytime you want to hear one.  But you are right; I must be going as to not be more late than I already am.  I do hope I see you again someday soon.”<br>
<br>
The bard started off, but looked back, her heart feeling heavy like she was leaving a friend she had known a lifetime.<br>
