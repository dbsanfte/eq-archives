<br>
First of all do ET want the server to turn into a world of constant battle about spawns. With Ksing and flames going back and forth to be normal procedure?<br>
<br>
Not really..<br>
<br>
Further more we will not do anything to force this happen on our server. Aslong as the rules are resonable we will also follow them as the rest of the server.<br>
<br>
I must admit anything that went on the FG raid which have been discussed so much was ever done with the Intent to screw the system. All Ive been told in the threads I have tried to state the problems that might occur that if I was nice and political about it we could solve the timezone issues with teamwork.<br>
<br>
Now dispite what everyone think they know about the facts Tamianx did not aproach me on that raid with a nice attitude in anyway. I never ever told him that I would screw him and not care. I tried very hard to reason with him, but doing so with someone that is upset before even getting in the conversation is almost impossible. <br>
<br>
People say I lied but I cant see where. I never ever said that I agreed to what the rules was. But that doesnt mean im not going to follow them. <br>
<br>
That day I made a judgement call considering the teamwork we talked about here on the boards. The posted raid after mine I added 30 min considering making groups, buffing and getting everyone into the stoney room. Took into account the spawn time that seemed to have been proved 100% to be 6 hours by the asian raid earlier that day. With all this it seemed to be possible, even with problems the delay on the raid after us would be minimal. Also if It worked we would have raided FGs 3 times in 1 day on brell which is very good used of the ressoucess we have to share among us all.<br>
<br>
Now how many players on this server would really flame someone else for having a few problems with their raid and pushing yours maybe 15 to 30 min at the max?<br>
<br>
Even though all this seemed to be very possible, I did contact the guildleader of which raids we might have pushed a little. Very clamly I explained the situation to her and apoligized if we had created any problems with our raid. We talked about a few other things that doesnt concern anyone really, but one of her requests was to let the issue drop and not take it any further which we both agreed on.<br>
<br>
The next day the flame was on the raid board as a personal attack on me with the subject &quot;/rude Lanos&quot;. I tried to honor the agreement I made with the guildleader and posted a very brief post that I had worked this out with the guildleader and that the issue should be solved.<br>
A few posts later I could see the guildleader posting that she thought I had dishonored our agreement and pretty much denied having ever worked out anything with me.<br>
<br>
I think that is what you call about being trapped between a rock and a hard place. Everyone in the thread was screaming for a response and explanation and yet I had promised not to take it any further and let it drop /shrug. <br>
<br>
I dont have any fanzy screenshots to back my story or any disire to seek forgiveness by the people that screamed for an answer in the thread. Im sorry that my atempt to make the server work together accross time zones to try and make everyone happy failed.<br>
<br>
We in ET are not out KS or cheat others out of their oppotunity to raid anything.<br>
<br>
As I did to guardian Revelation's guildleader that same night I would like to apoligize for any in conveignce my actions might have cause them.<br>
<br>
(I even contacted a few members I knew, all of them did not even know they had been delayed /boggle)<br>
<br>
If anyone else feel they have to stay away from my presence other than the ones already stated so. Then im very sorry but there is not really anything I can do about it. People read the boards and decide what they believe them selves. Judging people from what they have read on a messageboard and not what they learn inside the game is a choice.<br>
<br>
This will be the last thing I post about this issue as its getting no where.<br>
<br>

I am totally confused.  You post an illegal raid, impact ours, don't stop when this is brought to your attention, blame it on Koreans, state &quot;you did not agree to the rules&quot;, make no valid offer of compromise, and expect me to be nice?  You need help friend.<br>

You agreed to something, and you broke it.  You figure out why folks are pissed and wont support you.  If you can't, then your going to be consistently famed and eventually banned from everything people can ban you from.  I am sure you will respond that you have ET, so it does not matter.  But the facts are more to that if you continue as you are, and it is YOUR actions that being to erode ET's reputation, then I can only belive that ET folks will start to state their concerns with you.<br>

First, you made an agreement with her that you broke the next day.  Second, while I think it is about time, I will not yet accept your apology until I sit down with Deemum &lt;sp&gt;.  If the outcome of my discussion with him is positive, then I will come back to the boards and accept it openly.  Had you done this earlier, things would have been different.<br>

&quot;No&quot; is a good answer in YOUR opinion.  Quite a few besides Lanos have stated that they wouldn't dislike FFA.  Thats his opinion and he's entitled to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Further more we will not do anything to force this happen on our server. Aslong as the rules are reasonable we will also follow them as the rest of the server. - Lanos<br>

<br>
No, it says &quot;As long as the rules are reasonable&quot;.  EVERYONE on this server follows the rules because they are reasonable not because they are to their liking.  Many have stated they do not like some of the rules but they follow them because, even though they dislike them, they are reasonable.  If we made a rule saying &quot;You can only start a plane raid between 5 PM EST and 10 PM EST&quot; because thats when the majority raid and anything else will mess up spawns do you expect people to follow some rediculous rule like that?  I read his sentence as something like this.  I would be willing to bet that if some seriously messed up rule was put in that you too would be raising hell and not go along with it.<br>
<br>
I would bet that most guilds feel the exact same way as Lanos just stated.  If Ganon, Kambing, Kassim, Rylkith, Maya, etc came here and stated &quot;We will not do anything to force FFA to happen on our server. As long as the rules are reasonable we will also follow them as the rest of the server.&quot; would you say the same of them?  I doubt it because thats basically what everyone says now well of course if Andadas said that someone would probably jump him just like you did Lanos <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Personally this is what I wish I saw in the other posts Lanos.  Part of the issue to me was that you seemed to be refusing to apologize, even though you went against the rules.  I have no problem with someone mistaking the spawn times, tryin to work it out etc.  All myself and alot of people saw in the other thread was you breaking the rules and saying too bad for you.  People like Tetrian and Cyraxx cursing and insulting people.  That kind of stuff angers people because it shows a lack of respect, not just for the one guild you may of infringed, but the whole system. You apology to them is appreciated, even though I am not part of them.  <br>
<br>
I would like to say, respect is a 2 way street.  I heard you mention that the US guilds are uncompromising to you,  I can not speak on the specific details that you refer, but I do know MANY guilds on brell are willing to compromise and help each other out.  I hope you give them a chance to prove that the*uncompromising* ones only are a small selection. <br>
<br>
Good luck in the future.  <br>

<br>
A. Well .. your wrong. FG's are NOT 6 hours. They are 6 hours and a factor. We proved that the other eve.<br>
<br>
B. The rule is 8 Hours. I don't care about anything else, and you obviously don't agree or intend to follow that rule.<br>
<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
No no, it isn't not the rules, please read the rules and QUOTE them when you use them as an argument.<br>
<br>
The rules states the spawn is 8 hours. ( Which is false ).<br>
<br>
The rules doesn 't state any space time between two raid time.<br>
<br>
The point is that the rules is badly wrotten and must be rewrotten clearly. If you want more details about that, read /rude lanos post, i made a long answer to Relbeek about it.<br>
<br>
Lanos explained you in any way, neither him, ET or a ET member want to ruin other player experience. <br>
<br>
But if you consider the words in the FG rules, we didn't broke it. More further, the rules is based on a wrong equation (i.e 8 hour sspawn instead of 6 hours + random )<br>
<br>
While don't we work on setting a new FG rules that will protect you, your guild, and europa tribe of seeing raids cross-over another because the limits aren't clearly defined ? <br>
<br>
Messing your raid is one point<br>
Breaking the communauty rules is another.<br>
<br>
Reguarding the exact rule at this moment, we didn't break the rules. And we stated many time and by different players than we are sorry if your own raid have been messed because of our actions.<br>
<br>
If you think we still have broken the rules, please, quote the exact words rules and explain with logic how we did broke it. <br>
<br>
It isn't a rant on any way, i am simply trying to set up the 'ET broke the rule' point in a logic discussion reguarding the FG rule that is REALLY posted in the FG/Nagafen thread. <br>
<br>
As i wrote in the rant board, a 8 hours spawn doesn't means there must be a 8 hours space time between 2 raids. a 8 hours spawn means there should have been a 10 timespace hours and a 2 hours limit to kill the FG for example.<br>
<br>
If you want to discuss of the FG rule and how we break it, so let be it...<br>
<br>
'I quote' :<br>
Simple question, why are you taking this to another thread? We had one, you made another. Now a third .. /ponder<br>
<br>
I answer : <br>
<br>
Are you refering to the rant board thread /rude lanos ? There is a difference between a rant and a discussion. So far the thread in the rant board isn't a discussion. If you refer to a thread posted in a discussion forum, refer it please.<br>
<br>
I understand very well than Lanos doesn't want to post a long list argument between two posts of insults and personnal rants. I am sure as a guild leader, you are also able to make a logic discussion out of rant.<br>
<br>
If you are refering to another post, then , please, post a link so i can be cleared of that /boggle.<br>

Please follow the ones you consider unreasonable as well and seek to get them changed instead.<br>
<br>
Rules are in place for the good of the many.  This means that they have a downside by restricting what people want to do.  If you do not agree with a rule, however, disregarding it invalidates the entire set of rules, not just the one you disregard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usstiyrr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sstiyrr</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/22/01 2:27:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Leewei</span><hr size=1> I follow rules set up by a community as long as they are reasonable.<br>

<br>
I do not in any sense advocate excluding anyone unfairly from the reserved areas in Norrath, nor do I believe that is in any way the intention of those who run the reservation board.<br>
<br>
I furthermore believe that, while the reservation system may be inconvenient, it does not intrinsically prevent ET from getting Ragefire as it seems some people are claiming.  I believe that if the effort put forth into decrying the reservation system had instead been used to schedule and launch raids into Naggy's lair properly, everyone including ET would be a lot happier now.<br>
<br>
I stand by my previous statement.  If the reservation system is badly broken in some way, let's fix it.  Ignoring the broken parts is bad -- it leads inevitably to the conclusion that other rules can be ignored as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugaramebonhands.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garam Ebonhands</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/22/01 12:31:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leewei</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If a community would set up a rule, where you would have to outcast the Jewish Citicens, I swear hereby I would not respect that rule.

Give me a break. Reserving Fire Giants has nothing to do with mass genocide.  Nobody is asking that you go slaughter half-elf babies to keep the gene pool &quot;clean&quot;.  Please, anybody post an example of how following a rule, set by the Brell community, could be criminal.<br>

If for some reason, the server voted to make regular dungeons reservable (Seb, Chardok, L Guk, Sol B, CoM, HS, Dragon Necropolis, Kael, West Wastes, etc) I think I would chose to ignore those reservations, and treat them as intentions only, regardless of vote results. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/urelbeekeinre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Relbeek Einre</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>uncommonly Good</span><br>  Posts: 1695<br> <font color=#CC9900>(2/22/01 3:15:08 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.tigerden.com/~twilight/keebler-60x60.jpg BORDER=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Adune</span><hr size=1> It might be far better, Adun, to let that rule get put in place, to let it be shown how ugly and unworkable the rule is, and push to have it changed.

There is a standard for any system of rules that essentially boils down to the following:<br>
<br>
1) The rules should serve the purpose for which they were made.<br>
<br>
2) The rules should be neither too complex nor too restrictive to be followed.<br>
<br>
3) There should be tangible benefits to following rules.  There should be tangible penalties for breaking or ignoring rules.<br>
<br>
In this case, the reservation system seems to be working, for the most part.  Not much discussion about fairness was taking place following the vote on adding FGs to the reservation area.  The Fire Giant reservation was put into place to provide a training ground for future raiders.  This also seems to be working.<br>
<br>
Once Ragefire showed up, the situation changed.  Instead of noting that the rules were too restrictive to allow for the desired access to an epic mob, though, the reaction was instead to start ignoring the rule system in place.<br>
<br>
The end result, the &quot;penalty,&quot; is that many people now think that the players who ignored the reservation (and in so doing inconvenienced many) are scum.<br>
<br>
Civil disobedience, ignoring unfair and unjust rules in a passive way, is not wrong.  It's also not what is going on here.  What is going on here is a group of people tried to dodge an inconvenient system and got caught, then tried to justify it after the fact.<br>
<br>
There was no discussion of Ragefire before they got caught.<br>
<br>
There was no talk of unfairness before they got caught.<br>
<br>
If I'm wrong about this, please post a link to these discussions to this thread.  Otherwise, I see no reason to view those who ignored the reservation system as being other than disrespectful of those of us who abide by it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1399.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1378.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1377.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1377.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1377.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
