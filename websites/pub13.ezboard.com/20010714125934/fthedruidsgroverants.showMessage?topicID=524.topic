I have worked my butt off to make friends and have fun.  I never charge for SOW's, I will port people if I'm not already sitting in the bottom of some dungeon, and I haven't even bothered to learn to quad-kite!  I target PCs as I run by, and stop to heal them if they aren't full health.  I would rather die then train a mob anywhere near another party!<br>
<br>
All this, yet I'm cast into the same damn stero-type as some quad-kiting, lvl 60 in 3 days, use another group to dump adds, never been in a group, dewd speaking, arrogant, ass!  <br>
<br>
I am tired of having little pests come up and DEMAND me to PL them, gate them, give them stuff, and generally be their &quot;sugar-daddy&quot;!  I used to love playing my druid!  I have made many friends, and had a lot of great experiences in full groups, partial groups, and solo.  Now, my druid sits on the character selection screen, getting no play time.<br>
<br>
I have silently sat back while Clerics screamed about our heals and wizards yelled about our DD's.  I have been compassionate to a point, believing that everyone should have their nitche in this game.  I don't want to heal like a cleric, tank like a warrior, or deal damage like a rogue.  I like that I am jack of all trades, master of none!<br>
<br>
The world of Norrath has changed so much since release.  I long to go back and start the whole game over!  My druid is now retired because he is no longer fun to play.  I blame the attitude of players in general, and the acid that we have to endure on a daily basis.  I blame the beggers, the jealous, and the stereo-typers.  I'm saddened that I worked so hard for something, and have no joy in it anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry this was so long.  I had to vent.  Flame me if you feel the need.  This wasn't a rag on any class in particular, but more so of a general attitude that is prevelant in EQ today.<br>

<br>
You constantly come off as the wounded melee who thinks everyone who plays a caster, should play to please you.<br>
<br>
We wont.<br>
<br>
Were you not the same person who was left in the bank because someone didn't abort what they were doing to sow you?<br>
<br>
My main is a melee. I have asked a druid for a sow maybe 3 times in my career and I am usually nekkid when I do it. I got ported maybe 2 times in my career before I had a friend that was a druid. I never hung around the EC tunnel looking for sow and I once use SNEAK/HIDE to get from Freeport to Qeynos at the tune of about 3 and a half hours. Just the other day I WALKED from City Of Mist to Dreadlands. YES I could have pestered every Druid in Kunark to evac to EJ and pick me up for a few plat, but I CHOSE my Melee character, and I live by my choice.<br>
<br>
As a melee, I could care less about the skills of other players unless they were in my group.<br>
<br>
As a Druid, I appreciate the plight of melee and will SOW/heal for free IF THEY NEED IT. You do NOT need a sow at level 2 killing rats! You do not need a sow just so you can get from the FP Bank to the EC tunell faster! And yes it is MY skill and I will decide when I use it. I have been sitting at WFP gates and saw a monk &quot;pop&quot; in nekkid from obviously just dieing. THAT person got a SoW, LEV, Camo and Enduring breath and escorted all the way back to Cazic Thule so she could do a CR underwater.<br>
<br>
What the base poster said is absolutly true and NOT caused by druids giving free stuff away. It is just grown lazyness by a LOT of the population. IF a passing Druid sows your entire group, it is a GIFT, not an entitlement. Thank them and go back to your buisness.<br>

The buffs you get from a passing Druid, when cast on you before you even ask for them, are a gift. Accept them in the spirit they are given. And get on with your game. If you are lucky and don't bitch the druids out too much, you may get a lot more buffs for free too. But it is not &quot;your right&quot; to expect to be buffed or ported just cause you want it.<br>
Most players are really good about accepting a no if the druid is busy, but there are always those that want-(No,they demand)- something for nothing. And those are the players being addressed here. And you will sit forever waiting for a port if you bitch me out.<br>

If everquest's ruined level right now was rated, with 1 as awful and 10 as brand new, it would be around a 2.5, just because of assholes. Although everything isn't the other person's fault, sometimes it may be the druid's fault, more than once I've seen a person ask a druid who was doing nothing but meditating for a light buff kindly, and the druid completely freaked out, and even ignored the person, just because he said,  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usunndew.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sunndew</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/23/01 7:26:37 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yeah, I agree</span><hr size=1> You know, it has gotten so bad that I am getting the same crap in /gu!

They ruined UO, they ruined my favorite MUDs, so I decided to leave before everquest got ruined for me.) The thing that really bothers me is the fact that they think they're better than you, not the fact that they demand things, in RPG games you can expect stuff like that, infact, in all games where you can give stuff to other people, you can expect that (heh heh.. I still remember the time when someone in Counter-strike (a mod for Half-life) demanded that I give him a AK-47, a desert eagle, and some shotgun... ) So, before I go anymore off topic, The basic point is that I don't like the fact that they think they're better than us, not so much the fact they demand stuff from us. If they were kind, but still considered us inferior, too bad. No buff for you. But, (for me atleast) if they didn't consider us druid inferior, but still demanded abit in their buff requests, Who cares? Buff them, they'll eventually figure out that if they stop considering themselves better than everyone else, they'll first off, make more friends, and second of all, they'll be buffed by druids/shamen/clerics without even having to ask to be buffed. In my own point, If they think we're inferior, but ask us kindly, too bad. If they think we're just as good as they are, but still sorta demand buffs, give it to em. They'll learn. You can't be a ruffian and expect to be treated like a lady. So anyway, before I go anymore off topic, Bye.<br>

<br>
   &quot;Were you not the same person who was left in the bank because someone didn't abort what they were doing to sow you?&quot;<br>
<br>
First off..I was not at the bank, I was at the front gate.  If you had read my post, you would've known that.  Dumbass.<br>
<br>
Second off..  They were not in the middle of anything, and therefore I could not get mad at them for aborting anything, because there lacked anything to abort from.  Dumbass<br>
<br>
Third off..  If you had read my post, you would of known that I asked &quot;Can I have a SoW?&quot;..  Stunfuck or Lovegun or whatever said &quot;One sec.&quot; so I said &quot;Thank you&quot;.  THEN, 2 mins later (I was just standing there, thinking he was meming the spell) he got up, invited all his buddies who had just gotten there, and ported out, telling me &quot;Don't have it memed..bye&quot;.  Dumbass\<br>
<br>
   &quot;Just the other day I WALKED from City Of Mist to Dreadlands. YES I could have pestered every Druid in Kunark to evac to EJ and pick me up for a few plat, but I CHOSE my Melee character, and I live by my choice.&quot;<br>
<br>
You being a @#%$ retard is not my problem.  2 days before I quit EQ, Balidor, a level 51 rogue on Drinal, asked me to port to Dread, run to KC, evact to EJ, and pick him up...cause he was lost.  I asked him, 'Arn't there any druids a tad closer?&quot;  He said no, so I began the trip.  Ended up, I got killed by a trakaraptor in EJ, lost my corpse (why I quit) and finally, after an hour or so, found that damn rogue, and tported him out.  I spent the next 2 days searching for a necro to summon my corpse, or a bard to help me find it.  Because assholes DO exsist in EQ, such as Stunfreak and You (for being a retard for flaming me without reading the post you are flaming me about) I never found anyone to help, and my corpse rotted.  The point of this whole story, is that I'm tired of tards walking around, not asking for SoW, and not asking for tports, then Bashing druids for not handing out.  Just because you're too stupid for not asking for SoW or tports doesn't mean you need to bash on others who do.  Dumbass<br>
<br>
   &quot;As a melee, I could care less about the skills of other players unless they were in my group.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, if you wanna be a tard and live your EQ life the hard way....be my guest.  Dumbass<br>
<br>
  &quot;You do NOT need a sow at level 2 killing rats!&quot;<br>
<br>
First off...I was level 41...not level 2.  But I do feel that SoW at level 2 is JUST as important as SoW at level 41, or 60.  What is the point of SoW?  To out run your enimies right?  To get places faster right?  It has nothing to do with killing bigger monsters, or a privalge of higher level characters.  A drolvage Rager tearin down the north wall at KC is just as dangerous to a level 40 character as a large rat gnawing at a level 2's heels running for the guards.  SOW is not a level based buff.  Dumbass<br>
<br>
  &quot;I have been sitting at WFP gates and saw a monk &quot;pop&quot; in nekkid from obviously just dieing. THAT person got a SoW, LEV, Camo and Enduring breath and escorted all the way back to Cazic Thule so she could do a CR underwater.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again...addressing your lack of need for help with your melee char:  Do you lack faith in other druids?  You are not the only druid that helps out others.  You would find EQ alot easier if when you popped in NAKED....not nekkid..and a druid ported you to your corpse.  Try asking. Dumbass<br>
<br>
  &quot;What the base poster said is absolutly true and NOT caused by druids giving free stuff away.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, it is caused by druids giving away free stuff.  If the first druid created decided to not port anyone ever...  don't you think...after a while, people would stop asking?  When you ask to go out, and your parents say no...how many more times do you ask?  Maybe a few more times, then you get grounded.  Do you ever do that again?  NO, cause you know that you'll get grounded.  When the first nice druid came along, and started doing nice stuff....then got tired and quit...do you think all of a sudden, people just stopped asking?  Don't be so nieve.  You live in this world where everyone is an ass but you.  You can't tell me that you've ALWAYS helped and no one else has given you anything.  Don't be such a fool.  Dumbass<br>
<br>
<br>
Well..  I think I've addressed all the key points of your post.  I'll leave you with your foot in your mouth.<br>

<br>
Strike 1: you created your account the day you posted your first reply in support of Boofy.<br>
Strike 2: you can't seem to decide on a consistent spelling for your last name (inconvenient, that).<br>
Strike 3: those last two posts were within 5 minutes of each other. Seeing how little traffic this forum gets, that's rather odd.<br>
<br>
If you want a 4th, I doubt that a character would get to level 60 with the name Mojo... <p><center>
