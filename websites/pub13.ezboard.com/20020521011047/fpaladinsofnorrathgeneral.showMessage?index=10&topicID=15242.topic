<br>
Any class that doesnt complain must be too powerful and will either be nerfed in the upcomming expansion or forgotten.<br>
<br>
Don't forget, pre Kunark we were not complaining and every single class that DID complain got boosted. I don't know about you guys, but I don't really want to be in that position again for 2 more expansions.<br>
<br>
The druids are not just randomly complaining, they are asking for way too much... but it is because they know now is the time to ask for PoP upgrades. They will never get even 1/3rd of their list, but I guarentee that Verant is taking some time to figure out how to upgrade them in the expansion. (I'll also guarentee that if paladins think they are just fine, Verant won't spend any time trying to 'fix' them.)<br>
<br>
Sending in a list of legitimate ideas for the expansion would not hurt us at all. For example, the following ideas are not bad ones:<br>
<br>
Spells:<br>
1. Superior healing moved to 55<br>
2. Atone line of spells<br>
3. Summon food/water line of spells<br>
<br>
Disciplines:<br>
1. Defensive disc at 60 <br>
2. Undead Defensive disc to undead at 55 to replace holyforge<br>
<br>
Alternate abilities:<br>
1. Undead Tracking<br>
<br>
There are 100s of other little suggestions like this. I don't think we need any of these changes personally, but then again I don't think druids need any of their requested changes. The point is that we run a very real risk of nerf by omission if we don't submit ideas to Verant for PoP. <p>"Team El" of the Rathe<br>

I for one find that there are MANY things Verant could take the time to fix that are not working.<br>
<br>
1.  My LOH button does not work.  It still says SKILL 5 and I have no way of knowing if it is refreshed or not.<br>
<br>
2.  Sanctification is a worthless skill that has ONE use.  Trying to camp out in TOV.  That's it.  Nothing else.  This should have been fixed long ago.<br>
<br>
3.  They gave us Mass Group Buff.  Clearly this is simply a skill that they gave clerics and moved to us when they were giving us our AA Skills.  We have ONE FOOKING spell that this works with.  This should have never made it through testing, and should be replaced or fixed.<br>
<br>
4.  Our silence spell was nerfed right into the ground.  The spell now costs me more mana, stuns for less time, and has a longer recast time than stuns that I already have.  We were told that it was nerfed and they would be fixing it or changing it.  This has been 4 months now.<br>
<br>
5.  Divine Stun is worthless as well in it's current state.  I can count the number of mobs where this ability would be effective on one hand.  It was supposed to be a skill that affected ALL of our stuns, and gave us a chance on ALL of them to interrupt a casting mob level 56-60.  Now it is it's own stun.  As if I don't have enough stuns already, now I have another that &quot;may or may not&quot; actually stun a mob.<br>

That's a bug and of course it should be fixed.  It has never happened to me, it's not a universal thing.  That's not IMO something we need to sign a petition for.<br>

<br>
While I would certainly like to see Sanctification be more useful than it is, I can think of more creative uses for it besides just camping out in ToV.  Absorbing a nasty harm touch (or a slew of them from a group of mobs) is one example.  <br>
<br>
More generally though, I think it makes sense for Warriors to have more useful discs than we do because our spells are umm, more useful than theirs.  Yes I know there are melee differences too but those have been reduced significantly.  If we had equivalent discs to Warriors we would create a balance issue, not solve one.<br>

My understanding was that the way Mass Group Buff worked was that it was an activatable skill that made your next group buff Area of Effect.  Until it refreshed you couldn't use it again.  Therefore clerics, shamans, whoever could only use it for one spell.  Am I wrong?  <br>
<br>
If I'm correct then this is just as useful to us as any other buffing class if you discount the fact that other classes' buffs take significantly more mana to cast and can burn peridots whereas ours doesn't--it's definitely more needed for them, but not because we only have one buff to cast.<br>

This is one of the things on my wish list, and I really hope they do return it to the status of a useful spell to cast during high end raids.  Again though, I don't think Paladins are a &quot;broken class&quot; without it.  I'm plenty useful at raids and just about everywhere else.<br>

I agree that I would prefer this to work the way it was originally described.  Or even better I'd like it to work on 60+ mobs and give all stunning classes the ability to stun up to level 60.  If Verant's dev team truly thinks that Divine Stun is fully fixed/&quot;working as intended&quot; at this point then I do think it should be brought to their attention, at least until we get a response one way or the other from them about it.<br>
<br>
I think Verant is fully aware of this concern though, and I recognize that they can't fix everything at once or overnight so I'd rather give them time to fix it right rather than have everyone take up torches and storm the castle about it. <p><BR>

<br>
Not neccesarily in order of importance:<br>
<br>
1) ToK.  This needs some looking at.  It would be nice to have this spell be useful.<br>
<br>
2) The old silence spell needs to be put back to useful.  Since it was a class defining ability for a time there, perhaps making it good enough to be so again, without overpowering this time.  The current state is not that great.<br>
<br>
3) We're the &quot;defensive&quot; tanks yet we get no defensive type of disc.  This makes no sense to me.  Rangers can parry, bards can dodge, all other tank types else can riposite or go &quot;defensive&quot;.  We get a somewhat broken ability to resist spells.  <br>
<br>
4) Divine Glory series.  Well, this needs to be competetive and more useful.  Why would anyone take 100HP (Divine) over Str of Nature (75HP 25Attk)?  For that matter, who would ask for Brells over Call of the Predator?  We need more buffs that stack with our parent class, or that are separate in general, like the ranger.<br>
    I think making Divine 150HP 10AC and maybe 5 sv all would be a step in the right direction.  Perhaps making Brells 300HP 15AC and 7 sv all.  Not overpowering, but certainly desireable by some folks.<br>
<br>
5) Healing.  Superior just need to be moved lower.  If we are supposed to be part cleric, then a 57 ranger should not heal as well, or better, then a 56 Paladin (assuming similar wis and mana items).  Also, considering how hard things beging to hit post 50 as well as the increase in HPs, greater heal is no more then a bandaid.  We should be doing more then bandaging people being part cleric.<br>
<br>
6) Perhaps a slight increase in damage mitigation skills.  We are supposed to be the defensive hybrid.  Warriors have a very nice HP/AC advantage over us, as well as a huge gap in mitigation skills.  Rangers are as offensive as warriors, but we are not as defensive.<br>
<br>
    Overall I am happy with the changes to Paladins over the past 6 months.  we just have a tad farther to go and I'd consider us finished.  Obviously, not all of these things can be done or we'd be too powerful, but 3 or 4 of these could be done.  Then I believe we would be balanced just right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukidkod1ak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kidkod1ak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blessed Protector</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/02 9:17:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15242.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why TO petition: PoP</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Rangers are as offensive as warriors<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

My apologies.  Am I missing something?<br>
<br>
Rangers typically can use the same weapons or very close.<br>
Rangers typically have much higher attk ratings thanks to buffs.<br>
Rangers have nice damage shields.<br>
Rangers have the same offensive skill caps and damage table as warriors.<br>
Rangers have direct damage spells and damage over time spells.<br>
<br>
If I am missing some information, please let me know.  In fact, it would appear that they have more innate ability to deal damage then a warrior, but I am giving warriors the benefit of the doubt that some other table and/or innate crit abilities make up the difference. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A> at: 4/11/02 9:33:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uluthair.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luthair</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 1845<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/11/02 9:39:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15242.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why TO petition: PoP</span><hr size=1> Pushing Sup Heal down a few levels would be nice, its brutal for me healing 2600-2700hp unbuffed with gheal.

Hell if 99.5% of players wanted rangers to be given Ice Comet what would you see 2 patches down the line? Yep they'd be given Ice Comet, Draughts, and their own version of Lure.<br>
<br>
So sure, say we don't need anything but when druids are given sick spells, none of you can complain cuz we have the oppurtunity to do the same. Things needing to be changed..<br>
<br>
1- ToK turned into either a 25mana, interrupt, 100mana SEIVE (not drain) w/ ~90-120 sec recast, or a balanced silence spell.<br>
<br>
2- Sanctification changed to: if it isn't a mace, sword, axe, or spear you RESIST it ALWAYS. DT, HT, manaburn, ae, nukes, rains, IT DON'T MATTER we should resist every single one and for significantly longer too. <br>
<br>
3-Sup Heal to ~55<br>
<br>
4- Reso along w/ ShoW moved to 58 where Naltron is.<br>
<br>
5- Divine Stun be made worth putting 1, let alone 9, points into.<br>
<br>
6- Brells turned into something better. 200 is mickey mouse. I agree with the hp/ac/svs line. However, just sv magic would be more realistic.<br>
<br>
That should start the list fairly well <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=15242.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=15242.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15242.topic&index=19><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=15242.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=15242.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15242.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15242.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
