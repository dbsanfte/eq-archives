Disguising her powers behind faces of the different races.  Sometimes she chose to walk as an Erudite, one of the High Men that had chose to study the arts of Magic, or a paladin on of the holy knights, sworn to the cleansing of the evil that had become rife in the lands.<br>
<br>
Other times, she chose a more playful life and set her feet upon the path of a Wood elven Bard.  These merry souls could make their feet fly over the ground with a song.<br>
<br>
But, more often than not she found herself in quiet contemplation in the guise of a Human Monk.  She believed these souls that chose to walk this path of solitude and spirituality were truly her children.  That they were the closest to finding the True Path.<br>
<br>
She often found herself wandering through the Commonlands outside Freeport.  Occasionally helping to rid the lands of the Orcs that tried to infest the beautiful lands, but what she was really doing was looking for the one soul that would lead the others on the Path.  <br>
<br>
It was once such day that she found him.  She had just finished off an Orc and was humored by his dying threats, when she heard a shout calling young monks together.  A discussion was to be held behind an inn in the East Commons, a discussion about the ways of Tranquility.<br>
<br>
Her interest piqued she wandered to where the meeting was to be held.  A young monk named Jagriel welcomed her and called her sister.  It had been his voice she had heard calling the monks.  Quellious sat quietly, listening to the words of Jagriel.  Hearing the knowledge and love he spoke with.  Love of the tranquil ways and knowledge of self-defense.<br>
<br>
She knew, looking at the face of this man, listening to his words that he was the one.  The Child of Quellious.  As the meeting drew to a close, she stood.  Bowing her respect to the other monks, she asked if she might have a moment of the Sensei's time.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, I am no Sensei.  Merely one that wishes to impart the small amount of knowledge that I have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you like to be a Sensei?&quot;  Quellious asked<br>
<br>
&quot;If you mean would I like to teach, yes.  But if you mean do I desire the power that comes with leading others.  Then my answer would be no.  I do not wish power.  I only wish to guide and teach my younger brothers and sisters in the ways of Honor and Tranquility.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Good answer, Sensei.  And yes, you are a Sensei.&quot;  It was then that Quellious dropped her disguise.  Showing her true form in all it's child-like grace.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddess,&quot; Jagriel fell to his knees before her.  &quot;I had not known, here I was speaking on your behalf, please forgive me for being so bold.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Jagriel, you have spoken from your heart.  And I, your goddess, am the one that put those words there.  I have decided you are the one I seek.  You will lead others down the True Path, until such a time that your destiny lies elsewhere.  You need not ask forgiveness, you have done well.  Go out, gather more monks.  More of your brothers and sisters.  Show them the Light of the True Path.  Form an alliance, a family if you will.  Set their feet onto the path of teaching.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish&quot; Jagriel bowed to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Jagriel again, it is your destiny.  My wishes have no meaning; your destiny is one that lies in the Path of Tranquility.  But I warn you, there will be tests.  The minions of Cazic Thule and Innorruuk will try and turn you from the path.  You will lose friends, and gain enemies.  But you will form bonds that Hate and Greed cannot over come.  You will lead, you will be Sensei of the Zan Fi Monks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many years passed and Quellious often called Jagriel to her side to discuss his work upon the lands of Norrath.  She spoke to him of few monks that had embodied the spirit of the Zan Fi.  These noble monks Jagriel made his officers, to help find and guide other monks to the path.<br>
<br>
When the lost continent of Kunark was found, Quellius was most concerned.  For upon this island were weapons that would enable the monks of Norrath to fight better, however with these new objects came the potential for greed.<br>
<br>
There was also another concern.  A new race had been discovered upon this island.  The Iskar, they also had monks among their ranks.  Yet these monks did not follow the ways of tranquility, but the ways of despair and greed.<br>
<br>
Jagriel became concerned with the aspects of these new monks.  He did not agree with denying them their rightful place on the True Path, yet how could he honor them if their ways were so foreign to the path he had set his feet upon.<br>
<br>
Quellious guided him; she told him there would be few Iskar that chose to abandon their ways of evil.  They would wish a higher enlightenment.  She bid him to search them out. <br>
<br>
It became as the goddess said, a few Iksar did feel the calling of Tranquility and abandon the ways of Cazic Thule.  They were accepted as brothers and sisters of the monks of Zan Fi.<br>
<br>
The years continued to pass, and Jagriel began to feel another calling.  His soul still belonged to Quellious, but his heart felt there was more.  Often when he slept, Quellious would visit him in his dreams, she would urge him to have patience.  For she felt if Jagriel set his feet upon another branch of the path, there would not be a leader strong enough to hold the hopes of the Zan Fi together.  And above all else, the Zan Fi must remain united.  Their teachings, which Jagriel started, led many young monks to the True Path, the Path of Tranquility.<br>
<br>
Almost thirteen years to the day Jagriel was first visited by Quellious, rumors began flying about Freeport.  It was said a group of exploring Gnomes had found a new continent.  One where most of the ground lay frozen under massive glaciers.  Soon, explorers began to find their way to the frozen lands.  And the continent was named Velious.<br>
<br>
Some of Jagriel's brother and sister monks also ventured to this new land.  They brought back news of two new races upon the face of Norrath.  One was a race of dwarves; they accepted anyone into their city, Good and Evil alike.  The other was a race of war-like Giants, unlike all other giants the Zan Fi had fought in the past, these were intelligent, and they aligned with the God of War, Rallos Zek.  The monks also spoke of ancient armors and weapons that monks were able to make use of.  <br>
<br>
Coupled with the discovery of Kunark years before, Jagriel's heart again lay heavy at the news of these discoveries.  Would the Monks of Norrath become centered on the need for better armor, and better weapons?  Would they lose sight of the teachings of Quellious?  Was he strong enough to bring them back to the light of the Path?<br>
<br>
It was then that Quellious visited Jagriel, and spoke to him about the Other Branch.  She spoke of the many twists and forks of the True Path, and told him of her other children.  The Erudites, the Wood Elven Bards, the serious and the fun loving.  Both were different, but both walked the True Path.<br>
<br>
One eve Jagriel called his brothers and sisters together at the Totem in the Northern Desert of Ro.  They often held guild meetings here, yet this time, it would be different.  Jagriel just hoped his actions would not turn these good monks from the Path.<br>
<br>
&quot;My brothers and sisters, the time has come for me to walk another Branch of the True Path.  Quellious has once again opened my eyes and shown me where my destiny lies.  I have been shown the near future by Quellious and in the times ahead, we must chose our friends carefully, wisely.   Both of our Paths lead into times of sorrow.  But together, and separate we will stand against the Evils of Norrath.<br>
<br>
My friends, it is time for me to step down as your Sensei.  I have served you and Quellious many, many years.  And they have been good years, but she has given me a new task.  And so, also given me the name of your new Sensei.<br>
<br>
Sister Aaia, the child-like goddess Quellious has seen fit, in all her wisdom to set your feet upon the Path of Leadership.  She has seen your grace and strength and feels you are best to guide these young monks upon the True Path.  Do you accept this honor?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Jagriel, I….&quot; Aaia, wept.  &quot;I cannot, I cannot take your place.  You are my Sensei&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaia, my friend, you are not asked to take my place.  You are being asked to walk where I cannot.  Your strength is required here, not mine.  My heart is heavy my sister.  My vision has been clouded by this disenchantment I have been feeling.  I must find my place upon the path; I know it does not lie within the Zan Fi.  I will be walking through darkness, and I cannot ask any of you to make that sacrifice.  And so, I ask again.  Will you lead the Zan Fi Monks?&quot;<br>
<br>
Aaia bowed her head, and whispered, &quot;Yes&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaia, do not be saddened.  I still hear the voice of Quellious, but now she is guiding me in another direction.  I have seen the knowledge of others that walk the lands of Norrath.  My path, my calling, is not only to educate monks in the ways of Quellious, but all races.<br>
<br>
And to do so, I must leave the Zan Fi.  I must walk beside my elven brothers and sisters, fight beside the noble Barbarians, drink with the Dwarves, and yes, even learn to tolerate the healing touch of a Dark Elf.<br>
<br>
For are we not all creatures of the gods?&quot; <br>
<br>
After Jagriel left, Aaia sat upon the warm sands of the desert.  Looking at the totem, she remembered it was here she joined the ranks of the Zan Fi Monks.  And is now here that she was chosen to lead them.  She had doubts, she had questions, but most of all, she had fears.<br>
<br>
She felt eyes watching her, looking up she saw Sunshu, Nagasakee, and Zaffiro kneeling before her.  They were pledging on their honor to follow her where she led.  She could feel their love and faith.<br>
<br>
Aaia stood and raised her arms to the Heavens, to Quellious.  And spoke words that had only been spoken once before.  The three officers of the Zan Fi, and the new risen sun were her witnesses.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quellious, child-like goddess of Tranquility, by your divine wisdom, I pledge to you and to the Zan Fi Monks, to lead my brothers and sisters upon the True Path.&quot;<br>
<br>
As if in answer, the clouds from the night before parted and a ray from the dawning sun shone upon the sacred totem.<br>
<br>
And from that day, until Quellious so decrees, Aaia is Sensei of the Zan Fi Monks.<br>
<br>
~<br>
<br>
(IC)<br>
<br>
This tale was told to me in a dream, by Quellious herself.  May her grace and love shine upon the Zan Fi, and upon Sister Aaia, and my friend Jagriel.<br>
<br>
To you, my friends, my family I kneel in humbleness.  I pay respect to thee and thy family in the traditional monk way.<br>
