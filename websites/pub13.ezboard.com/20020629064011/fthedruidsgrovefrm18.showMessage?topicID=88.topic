I have been working on this particular strategy for quite a while now, and I feel it is now ready to be released.  I have debated writing this for a while now, especially with the 'druid petition' in its current stages.  However, this is the main reason I have decided to go forth with the writing.  I am one of those druids that actually *loves* the class.  I too have little action at raids, so I have to find other ways to amuse myself.  <br><br>First off, I would apologize if this is all completely obvious information.  I honestly haven't seen any guides for this type of solo'ing... and I've worked out the kinks pretty much by myself.  Second apology would be for the length of this guide.  I know it's gonna be a biggun, sorry if this bores you.<br><br><b>What is PBAE solo'ing?</b><br>You've probably joined a lot of AE groups in the past.  The idea is: Player goes and grabs 40 mobs, brings it back to his full group typically consisting of 1-2 enchanters, 1 cleric and several wizards.  They group around the enchanters who begin chain AE-stunning.  The wizards jump in and nuke the mobs down with their Point Blank Area Effect <i>PBAE</i> spells.  Eventually the mobs all die, and the group gets experience for LOTS of kills, in a relatively short period of time.  <br><br>The problem that WE have with this type of grouping is primarily our lack of good PBAE spells.  We basically have... Upheaval.  This is the only spell that gives decent damage, and it has a seriously bad mana-damage ratio.  Add in the 24 second recast delay and you realize that you don't fit in the average AE group.  <br><br>What I noticed about these groups however, was the pure dependence on each other.  Lose your cleric and you are screwed the minute the enchanters have LOTS of resists.  Lose an enchanter and everyone is screwed.  Lose a wizard and you may not have enough mana to kill the lot, and that would really piss you off watching 30 mobs at 20% go free.  <br><br>Druids can do this type of killing... <b>SOLO</b><br><br>What you WANT to see:<br><IMG SRC="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/pbae02.jpg"><br><br>I originally started doing this in the early SoV days.  It worked great for harvesting panther skins in WL.  The idea was, run around agro'ing every panther in the zone, take them to a relatively safe spot (in WL, the North wall, sorta NE of the lake) then start snaring them.  Once all were snared, I would time the casting of Upheaval to hit them all just at maximum range of the 'point-blank'.  Panthers were great to test this on, because they A) didn't hit too hard.  B) didn't have HUGE attack range.  and C) They were all Green mobs.<br><br>The idea worked great and I was able to basically keep all of WL clear of Panthers.  <br><br>I was 'retired' for the first 3 months of Luclin.  Still, I would visit all the old guilds' websites, and I saw how huge AE grouping had become.  I also noted how The Grey had evolved into a haven for AE groups.  Plenty of low hp, low resist mobs that give blue experience.  When they nerfed the zone, I knew that this would effectively kill the zone to all but solo'ers.  It basically did.  Sure, you still see the freak 1 or 2 groups pulling stuff to either zone, but for the most part... it's all Wizards, Druids and Necromancers running the zone.  <br><br><B> STFU already, what is the strat?</b><br><br>K... basically, what I have developed was a way to kill many more mobs with a full mana bar then most Druids are used to.  My best pull was 31 mobs.  My lowest are around 10-12.  Average pull is 15-20 mobs.  This is of course based on how many people are in the zone, and who is pulling your skeletons.<br><br>My example zone is The Grey.  I think this would work great on the Laborers in ME.  I have a few other ideas as to where this strategy would be great at.  For now, we'll stick with The Grey.  The best type of mobs are those that corpse camp.  The "tormented iksar slave" types in TG are corpse campers.  Many of the other mobs in TG are not.  The actual KITING takes place in the Northeast corner.<br><br><b>Step 1</b><br><br>Bind nearby.  Obvious reason is for easy CR.  Second reason is stated soon.  For The Grey, I bind in Scarlet Desert, right at The Grey zone line.  <br><br><b>Step 2</b><br>Get your buffs in order.  SoE is almost <u>required</u> here.  PoTG+Mask+Bladecoat+RoTG+EB(if needed).  I *really* like to have KEI as well.  At 625 mana EACH, 1 or 2 missed nukes will seriously put the hurt on your mana pool.  <br><br><b>Step 3</b><br><br>Get your swarm.  Run around and agro every skeleton you can possibly see.  They hang out on the ground, some times in packs.  You can stand nearby, swing at them, run past... whatever it takes.  Get a LOT.  One time, I must have had at LEAST 50 skeletons agro'd on me.  (edit... this doesn't mean my actual *kite* was 50'ish... that's just how many I had agro'd on me for this phase...) Surely other mobs will join in the chase, none of them matter.  You'll probably trigger a LOT of those annoying wurm traps, don't worry about them either.  Just get your swarm of mobs chasing you... UNSNARED.  You'll get a pretty good distance ahead of them eventually.  Run them up to the North Wall, and when you have sufficient distance to cast, <b>Gate</b>.<br><br><b>Step 4</b><br><br>Clear the stragglers.  Zone back into TG and run up to where you left your mob.  You'll see ALL of the agro'd skeletons sitting there, dumbfounded.  All of the wurms will have depopped, or will be any second.  Any golems will have slowly moved away from where you left your swarm.  The main annoyance will be the Rockfiends.  The *great* thing about them however, is their level.  You can't level-pull them, unlike the skeletons.  So, just target one of them, and cast something annoying, like drones of doom.  You'll have not only the TARGET chasing you, but all the other Rockfiends should be as well.  <br><br>Run them someplace FAR (I do the NW corner) then gate again.  Easy enough way to get your skeletons solo, no?<br><br><b>Step 5</b><br><br>Pull those skeletons!<br><br>Zone back into TG and run back to your swarm.  For your first time, I wouldn't do more than 12 or so.  Basically, you target one, hit ensnare (please don't use 'snare' if you do, quit this guide now) and back off.  Count in your head "1".  Target the swarm again and ensnare the next... back off.  You'll have a few chasing you, but nice and slowly.  Just do circles around a few times to pull the snared mobs away, then back to the swarm to grab another.  You really want to do this as soon as possible.  Snaring 30 mobs takes a LONG time, and you need to remember, your first snared mobs Snare timer is ticking.  <br><br>Regardless of how many skeletons were in your initial swarm, stop after you have counted your 12th or so skeleton.  You don't want to start with a LOT for now.  <br><br><b>Step 6</b><br><br>KILL THEY!<br><br>This whole thing is dependant on one important skill: Timing.  You have to perfectly time the cast-time of Upheaval with when you are anticipating them to be at the max range of the spell.  You really can't explain this in words... you just have to try it.  If you want to see the range for Upheaval, go to some zone where you have stationary GREEN mobs that you don't mind killing.  Blackburrow is one.  Walk up to an gnoll, cast upheaval... if it didn't hit, walk a bit forward... try it again.  You want the swarm to be grouped up nicely, so that you hit them at max range.  <br><br>l33t Photoshop skills example:<br><br><IMG SRC="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/max-range.jpg"><br><br>Green arrows = yes, in range... red x's = no, not in range.  Ideally, you wouldn't have any mobs BEHIND you, but it works for example =p.  <br><br>Do NOT expect to channel your casts off and hit all of them.  Even if you DO channel, you won't hit them all.  Only a few mobs can hit you at one time, so if they have started beating on you, 4 will be on you, the rest will be warping around you, and you'll see something lame like this:<br><br><IMG SRC="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/too-far.jpg"><br><br>If you saw this, you screwed up.  Either of 2 things happened.  First, they got IN range, and MOST of them started warping behind you, thus out of range... OR... they weren't grouped tightly enough, and were mostly 'in-line' to kill you.  Those first in line got hit, and the rest were lucky enough, and too far.<br><br>THIS is what you would prefer to see:<br><IMG SRC="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/ideal.jpg"><br><br>The WORST thing that can happen is you time it COMPLETELY off.  You NEED to get this down perfectly, or you'll waste too much mana to finish them off =/.  If you cast it, and the WHOLE mob was too far, you'll spend 625 mana, and get no damage.  Nothing hurts worse then seeing: "You begin casting Upheaval..."  then nothing.  If you even THINK that they'll be too far, duck it at the end, and back off quick.  Missing even ONE nuke can make it impossible to finish them, depending on mana pool.<br><br><b>Step 7</b><br><br>Looting...<br><br><Img src="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/carnage.jpg"><br>results in:<br><IMG src="http://66.1.253.130/los/vonkaar-pbae/looting.jpg"><br><br>These were taken a few hours ago. This was a smaller pull I did for the guide.  Maybe someday I'll take screenshots of the bigger pulls and the longer, more impressive loot list.  <br><br><b> TIPS </b><br><br><i>Med kiting:</i><br>I've heard it called 1/6 med kiting, or step5 medding... this isn't MY strat, so don't accuse me of plagiarism.  Basically... medding doesn't require you to be sitting for a full tick.  You just need to sit for a full second of the tick.  So in each tick, sit for 1, run for 5.  Obviously, it's hard to meditate when you have 25 pissed off skeletons chasing you... this could give you a bit of extra mana while waiting between each Upheaval.  24 second recast means 4 ticks of meditation, if you can do it right anyways.  <br><br><i>Gear selection</i><br>A Druid with a LOT of flowing thought would have a much easier time then I do.  At the time of this initial writing, I only have FT1.  NO Mental Clarity.  My mana regen is typically potg, ft1 and mask yet I usually finish each kite with 1 bubble of mana left.  It CAN be done without having AMAZING equipment.  Sure, I grab at any chance I can for KEI.. even basic clarity would make a huge difference.<br><br>Another thing to consider, is system performance.  When I am at home, I'm on my old P3-450 with a 64meg Radeon.  Radeon SUCKS for frame rate, and having 20+ skeletons all grouped up really really lags my graphics.  This tends to make me get hit a lot more then if I was on a different system.  I balance this out by wearing a bit more HP gear then I would wear at a better system.  Example, Elysian leggings over ToV.  When playing at work, I have system-of-own, so I wear as much mana as I can get ^_^.<br><br><i>Missed nukes</i><br>If you miss more then 1 or 2 nukes, you may just want to gate out and try again.  Take your mob someplace neutral, and gate away.  Living and keeping your KEI is always better then death.  If you think you can still pull it off, go for it.  Don't be surprised if you run out of mana, and the snare timer is clicking.  If you are THINKING yer almost outta time, start randomly snaring mobs off yer swarm.  As soon as the first snare breaks, target him and resnare.  Keep doing this til you stop seeing snares breaking, and resume nuking/medding/whatever.  <br><br>If you have a huge swarm, channeling all those snares and WINNING may still be worth it.  How crappy would it be to have to gate out, leaving 30 mobs at 5% health to be happily killed by that bastard Necromancer that has been spying on you for the past hour?  If you had 10 mobs in your swarm, you are OOM, and they are at 50% when your snares start breaking... just gate out.  That's not worth it IMHO.<br><br><i>Be Considerate</i><br>If you are in a heavily populated zone, waaatch out for other players.  YES it is nice to kill 20 mobs at once, SOLO.  SURE it looks badass to do something that no other class has ANY chance of doing... still, you'll piss a lot of people off if the zone is empty due to your amazing skills =p.  But the MAIN thing to worry about is accidentally killing some other player.  I have found that if you run too far away to med up a bit, and there are other players sitting nearby medding, your whole swarm may feel like eating that little gnome on its way to get you.  An AFK necromancer liching to 20% doesn't stand much chance against 30 pissed off lvl 45 skeletons.<br><br><b>IN CONCLUSION</b><br>I hope this guide will help all the >other< bored druids out there rake in the XP.  I average 3 blues per pull.  My biggest pull got me a full yellow of experience.  Yes... one yellow.  I know of NO other class that could possibly do NEAR this.  I'm sure if more people do this, we'll see some highly skilled Druid take out 40+ mobs at once.  Next time you get looked over for an AE group in Acrylla because of your poor PB spells, smile and gate off to The Grey.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>-Vonkaar<br><br>(Special thanks to the retired Nizzar for teaching me the 1/6 med kite, and to Abru for giving me post-retirement tips on where this could be done in The Grey.)<br><br>edit: hopefully this new pic site will let me host the fuggin pictures *correctly* this time... any suggestions to a *free* webhost would be great =pp <p><BR><FONT SIZE="+1.4" FACE="courier"><B><font color="#306754"> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36786">Vonkaar - Nameless</a></B></BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvonkaar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>vonkaar</A> at: 5/9/02 5:23:48 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umalikaiiscariot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malikai Iscariot</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.nettally.com/padgett/swirl.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/22/02 10:36:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nettally.com/padgett/Malikai.jpg height=193 width=154></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vonkaar's Guide to 20mob+ PBAE killing (&gt;SOLO&lt;)</span><hr size=1> OMG.

I've tried to figure out a way to quad better or do more than a quad using stuff like Blizzard, Upheaval, etc. but it was too hard to keep the mobs within Blizzards AE even when i did circles around it, and Upheaval just had too long of a reload time.  <br><br>Your strat sounds worth trying, just seems really dangerous when your talking about 10+ mobs simultaneously hitting you at the same time if you screw up the timing.  So i'd say the risk vs reward is pretty balanced considering it sounds like a big pain in the ass in terms of setup, and pretty dangerous in terms of timing the AE.  I just hope i dont see a ton of Druids in the Grey now hogging all of the Tormented Skelly's.  Might be easier with the Golems since they move so slowly, then again your screwed if they get one of them stuns on you.  <br><br>Anyways, nice guide :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uclakar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Clakar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/22/02 2:50:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vonkaar's Guide to 20mob+ PBAE killing (&gt;SOLO&lt;)</span><hr size=1> Do you have to be lvl 60 to lvl pull the skeletons there?<br><br>Anyone know of other zones this could work in? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uabru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/22/02 11:52:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vonkaar's Guide to 20mob+ PBAE killing (&gt;SOLO&lt;)</span><hr size=1> I messed around with this in The Grey as well.  Don't pull static mobs around temple -- they WILL warp on you.  Stick to north east corner and the corpse-camping skelly types, as it appears Vonkaar is also doing.<br><br>I missed a few skells too often for my taste, so instead I wedged myself against a rock, and timed the PBAE to go off right after three of them meled me.  That worked great, even if I got interrupted sometimes, dispite the wedge.  The trick there is just not to stick around right after they all get hit -- it turns out that though usually only 3 mobs can hit you in a mele round, ALL of them can hit you in a mele round if you just AEd them, so you will likely die if you stick around after a PBAE on non-stunned mobs.<br><br>I killed thirty something, and got loads of exp, but all in all, this is a lot more work than its worth to me.  Just pulling 12 or so around temple and quadding them all with the regular 4-mob AE seems better when you measure exp-to-effort. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126501">Abru</a>, Elder Hierophant on The Nameless,  <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/index.shtml" target=_top>Legacy of Steel</a>, <a href="mailto:AbruEQ@hotmail.com">AbruEQ@hotmail.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uabru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/22/02 11:55:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Also...</span><hr size=1> Part of the reason for the wedging technique was that I was pulling so many skeletons that snares would wear off before I was done, so I just pulled them all and did PBAE with unsnared mobs, which was far less work. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=126501">Abru</a>, Elder Hierophant on The Nameless,  <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/index.shtml" target=_top>Legacy of Steel</a>, <a href="mailto:AbruEQ@hotmail.com">AbruEQ@hotmail.com</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uchemoshbegosh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ChemoshBegosh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/23/02 1:17:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=88.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://chemoshtz.homestead.com/files/Stats.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vonkaar's Guide to 20mob+ PBAE killing (&gt;SOLO&lt;)</span><hr size=1> Just want to say I love you for this thread, i got 1 AA lvl in about 3 hours with ur aeing today. not to mention some uber loot as well...

Having some good regens definitely helps, and next time i do it i plan on regening myself(just had fungi on).  I still dont have timing down though, and thats the tough part.
