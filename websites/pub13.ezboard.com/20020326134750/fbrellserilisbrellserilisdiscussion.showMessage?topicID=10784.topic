THE TIME HAS COME!!!!<br>
<br>
I, Khuamak, arrived in the dimly lit war room in the cave of Crog Bigcheeze. Troubled, I watched as Crog paced back and forth staring up at crude pictures drawn in blood on the rock. I have been here many times over the years, but have never discussed these images with my Leader. He has not deemed to mention them, and I, Ogre that I am, felt it unnecessary to ask of them.<br>
<br>
The images depict figures of dwarves. Dwarves surrounding an ogre of immense size and stature. He stands thrice thier size and more...a giant among Ogrekind. My knees tremble with the urge to kneel before even the blood drawn image of him. He wields a hammer, its head half the size of those that surround him.<br>
<br>
The next wall shows battle, dwarves and their parts flying about the air, hewn and torn. Yet the Ogre remains surrounded. He is covered in blood, his hammer red now. Innumerable cuts across his calves and thighs prove that the dwarves have touched him with their puny axes. <br>
More pictures on the East wall depict an endless stream of hewn and torn bodies, a masacre of epic proportion the dwarven race must still be reeling from to this day. The wall is mostly red except for the center, which shows yet still the standing ogre. Standing, yet with no weapon in hand. The Hammer dropped to the ground while the hand that held it clutched an arrow protruding from the socket his eye should have been. A large dwarf, a crown upon his head, is evedent in the background holding a bow hewn from the rib bone of large animal. He is grinning.<br>
<br>
The last picture, barely recognizable having been hacked at with some type of weapon shows a city. Kaladim, home of the dwarves. It is surrounded by Ogres, Trolls, Dark Elves and recently drawn in Iksar.<br>
<br>
I sat and watched Crog pace and stare, return and start again, and wondered what the summons from my leader was all about. Turning, I nodded to Crog's Second in Command, Jotaax, Crogs brother, as he entered and sat in a seat next to me. My look must have been plain upon my face as Jotaax only shrugged and opened one of his backpacks searching for his sharpening stone.<br>
<br>
One by one the rest of Da Skurge's Officers filed in the door. Most of a day had passed before they were all there. Mighty Baron Exuo, the darkest knight in the guild. Utlaar, his face hidden within the depths of his black cowl, his skeleton pet trailing him. Rorr stamped in covered in gore from a recent fight with some unlucky beast. Nankek the Shaman picking his teeth with his spear. Trogbok and Aook, both grinning as they shared half a tundra kodiak between them. Hardluk came in dragging yet another woodelf druid he had caught. The screaming was a pleasant change in the quiet of the room as we all shared what was left of it.<br>
<br>
Finally stopping his pacing, Crog stepped out of the ditch he had ground into the floor of the room over the long years. He faced the table where we all sat waiting and looked from one of us to the next, staring into our eyes. Reaching the empty seat of Tilnayin, I thought I saw a look of sadness pass thru his eyes. A quick look yet even more quickly replaced by the determination he had had there all day. He sat down in his high backed chair at the head of the table and took a deep breath. Releasing it slowly, he spoke for the first time that day.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is time&quot;, he said looking at Jotaax.<br>
<br>
Jotaax's grin was as fierce as any I've ever seen from him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Time....finally&quot;, Jotaax said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell them&quot;, Crog instructed.<br>
<br>
Jotaax turned and told us the tale that had brought Da Skurge into being. He spoke long, very long for an ogre, and it was very late in the night when he finally finished. The tale was of Crog and Jotaax's father. And his death. His death by the Dwarven King. A tale of one of the mightiest ogres ever to set foot upon Norrath, and his demise at the hands of the hated dwarves and of a poisoned arrow.<br>
<br>
When Jotaax had finished his tale, Crog, who had sat immobile thru the telling stared once again at the seat of Tilnayin, missing for many months now. He paused there for a few moments, then turned. He turned to me, and said words I will never forget.<br>
<br>
&quot;Assemble my army.&quot;<br>
&quot;Plan our attack.&quot;<br>
&quot;The Dwarven King dies within the week!&quot;<br>
&quot;IT IS TIME!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Silence filled the room for only seconds, then roars unheard in many years threatened to collapse the ceiling upon us as we shouted out our hatred and vow to see this deed done, to avenge Crog and Jotaax's Father. To kill the Dwarven King and hang his head on a pike for all to see.<br>
<br>
Many of you, like us, hate the Dwarven race. I call upon those of evil nature. If you have a wish to avenge yourself and families on the hated Dwarves then come...come and join us while when we invade the Dwarven City Kaladim and kill its citizens and its King. Come Ogres! Come Trolls! Come Dark Elves and Iksar! Join us in the slaughter!!!!<br>

I personally wish everyone would simply forget about the guild trainer part of our raid here...its done and over with!  HISTORY...gone!!!  Something that NEVER happend now.<br>
<br>
The &quot;speedbump&quot; we had in the beginning of our raid did one thing and one thing ONLY...cause us a slight delay!<br>
<br>
Da Skurge DID EXACTLY what we said we would!<br>
<br>
Kaladim BURNED...we killed and ATE their King...he has been DETHRONED...he cried like a lil girl and begged for his life and dishonored every dwarf in the process.  HE RAN FOR HIS LIFE!!!  His guards didn't even come to his rescue the 2nd and 3rd times!  DA SKURGE OWNS KALADIM!!!   KING CROG BIGCHEEZE RULES KALADIM...we even thinking of renaming it to SKURGADIM!!!<br>
