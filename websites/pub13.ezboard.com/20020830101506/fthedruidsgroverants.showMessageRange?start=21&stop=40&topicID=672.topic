<br>
That's right, it's the groups fault they had been camping in an area some could quad in.  you CAN quad almost any where, it is just not safe.  just like agroup CAN camp any where, but it is not always safe.<br>
<br>
The druid was a prick.  not suprisingly so.  alot of people are pricks in EQ.  Druids have the most.  the reasons are simple.  most classess to raise solo take a considerable ammount of skill, and determination.  Druids have travel, and great solo ability and good grouping ability.  espicaly pre 50. and soloing for a druid is easy as hell.  I am sorry if you think quading is hard, but it is not.  not at all.  the hardest part is making sure your snare does not wear off. <br>
<br>
as a necro if I am CS killing for XP, and decided I don't like this place, I have the option of asking for a port, or spending 30 min running to GD, waiting on the portal to luclin, then choosing which content I would like to hunt on, and running from the luclin port down to where over that might be. from CS to chardok for a necro is 9 zones, twice waiting for luclin portals.  if you do not have luclin<br>
it is 12 zones. and 3 boat rides (well two actual boats, and 1 raft) even longer if you are not evil.<br>
For a druid. 3, with or without luclin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Except monks and bards.<br>
<br>
Fastest leveling soloing classes, that have absolutely no fear of death.&quot;<br>
Have you ever played a monk or a bard?  bards not having a fear of death, man you are truly that dumb, or just like to look that way?<br>
<br>
a druid will die about the same ammount a monk will solo.  Yes I know monks get FD, but with mobs 35+ it only has about 10% chance to wipe the hate list, that means they come back as soon as the monk stands up.  where as a druid will usualy have sow on, and can simply outrun somthing while heading to the zone.  but what about the druids that solo inside.  it's called gate.  and most idiot druids do not solo indoors, it's not easy.  you need some basic knowledge of agro and the like. sure bards can outrun mobs like you outdoors, but inside thier screwed.<br>
<br>
I do not hate druids. I hate idiots.  druids just make good class for idiots.<br>
<br>
Druids bring a good ammount to a group, and a well played druid is always somthing I consider for an XP group.  Druids are a utility class. they have a wider varriety of abilites, but cannot do any of the the best.  Yet druids rarely get groups based on the fact that people rarely ever see what a druid CAN do.  99% of the druids I have grouped with did one role. that is it.  60% did one role badly.  I have played enchi and healer, while we had a druid that only snared. when the druid left I healed mezed and snared.  the group was happy to loose the druid, because he forgot to snare a few of the mobs. in that make up the druid should have been healing and snaring, with myself as a backup healer if he got LoM, as he should have been back up CC with root, or snareing extra dmg output, and back up healing.<br>
<br>
So if you think you I should move, because you CAN quad where I can fear kite, we are gonna have a nice little problem on our hands. <p><p><center><br> Bringer of Darkness</br><p><A target=B href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11832" ><IMG HEIGHT=500 WIDTH=271 SRC="http://members.cox.net/umbrae/pic.jpg" BORDER=0></a></center></P></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uiralikespotato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IraLikesPotato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333399>(7/1/02 10:35:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=672.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This board makes me sick</span><hr size=1> Umbrae was 100% right.

Am I saying 100% of the druids are assholes? Nah, that's stupid to even think that. But the simple fact is this: new player buys EQ, new players starts oh... a Dark Elf Shadowknight (cool sounding, big hit for very first chars that make it to lvl 4 then delete.) While the new players is played that DE SK he sees the SoW spell, that's it he's a druid right there. I'm betting a huge amount of druids start this way. <br>
<br>
People like to bitch alot about how hard soloing is, news flash:<br>
<br>
Fear kiting is not hard<br>
Mage pet fighting is not hard<br>
Quad kiting is easier than both of those every day of the week and twice on sunday.<br>
<br>
First time I started trying to quad I was expecting it to be tough... then I realized OMFG this is insanely easy with 10 minute low resist snare you have to be the dumbest bastard in the history of EQ to die on a quad. My druid made it from 34-48 mostly quadding, and died once from lag spike and once from LD, that was it. Never did a mob break snare or resist snare and pound me to death. Never did I have trouble getting a bunch of mobs on me (when I got too many adds I'd zone, very simple since I have a spell that makes it impossible for the mobs to  catch up to me.)<br>
<br>
This is when I realized why so many druids complain about quadding difficulty: because so many druids are bad players.<br>
<br>
Well anyways I'll leave this thought:<br>
<br>
remember, most droods are played by 12 year old kids or retards, so sometimes they learn kinda slow, be patient with them and eventually they will get the message to @#%$ off and die.<br>
<br>
I love when druids train my nec, I'll unsnare your mobs all day long, PnP you say? /shrug I've done this to several @#%$ druids and have never had a gm or guide even send me a tell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uhediengoeseek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hedien Goeseek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333399>(7/1/02 10:49:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=672.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Man I am glad I came here.

But really thou druids get a lot of bad reputation because they do a lot of stupid things. Why? Well a long time ago it was so easy to level druids every 3rd char was a druid. They soloed and didn’t learn jack @#%$ or sold their accounts.<br>

So because of the huge numbers and the relative ease of playing a "basic" druid (not learning any advanced tactics, learning how to group well etc.) you will get twice as many bad players. <br>
<br>
Necromancer's are really the same, most people (and this does not exclude some necromancers...) have no idea a necro can mezz and heal. Just that we're no longer a popular class anymore (Pre-RoK necro and druid were about equal in numbers).<br>

You know what?  I thought about looking at your post and actually picking apart what you said.  After reading all of your replies a couple of times, I decided it wasn't worth it.<br>
<br>
You few who have posted here have already had your minds set about the druid class, and nothing that anyone posts here will change your mindset.  By posting in this thread in the manner that you have, you have pretty much formed everyone's opinion about you as well.  It doesn’t matter if your secondary, tertiary, or even your fourth character on your eighth account is a druid.  You haven’t succeeded in making druids look bad, you’ve succeeded in adding a few more trolls to the message board whole.<br>
<br>
I will stand toe-to-toe with anyone who wants to have a conversation or debate about whose class is better than someone else's.  I can probably bring up points about why any and every single class in EQ is "the most powerful class in the game."  I can give you 101 examples of why necro's suck, but I could reverse that and tell you exactly why I'd want one in a group.<br>
<br>
You all came here to troll and that's fine - you're in the right forum to do it in.  <br>
<br>
If it made you feel better to come to our "home," our "community" and say, "yeah, you guys suck," you need a new way to raise your self esteem; because if the only way you can get off is to try and stroke a fire fight between two classes, that's pretty sad.<br>
<br>
Why don’t you come back next time someone links you back to our boards.  We’ll still be here.<br>

my post time (7/1/02 9:18:18 pm)<br>
time this thread was added to necro boards (07/01/2002 :  23:27:19)<br>
Yes, I origonaly wandered over here from the post on the necro board, yet belive it or not, I used to read this site.  I stoped quite a while ago, only coming here if I need to look up somthing specific. so after adding my coment to one thread I looked arround.  if you feel that this in some way makes me a troll, as I find a thread, read and respond to it, by all means, please don't let me try and warp you fragil little mind.<br>
<br>
I will assume your post was directed at myself, as well as the others of my class. if not then you should be more specific.<br>
<br>
formalities out of the way.<br>
<br>
&quot;You few who have posted here have already had your minds set about the druid class, and nothing that anyone posts here will change your mindset&quot;<br>
<br>
Quite true, I think I summed it up nicely before, but will do so again for your bennifit.<br>
Druids bring a good ammount to a group, and a well played druid is always somthing I consider for an XP group. Druids are a utility class. they have a wider varriety of abilites, but cannot do any of the the best. Yet druids rarely get groups based on the fact that people rarely ever see what a druid CAN do.<br>
if you find some flaw in that, please let me know, I would hate to be spreading missinformation about an entier class.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will stand toe-to-toe with anyone who wants to have a conversation or debate about whose class is better than someone else's&quot;<br>
<br>
Good for you, are you looking for a cookie?  for as yet I do not see one single coment about XX class beeing better than druids.  I do see people stating how hard / easy it is for some classess to solo.  I simply added my thoughts onto that topic.  if you need help understanding that, I could go through some more of the post and site actual examples.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If it made you feel better to come to our &quot;home,&quot; our &quot;community&quot; and say, &quot;yeah, you guys suck,&quot; you need a new way to raise your self esteem; because if the only way you can get off is to try and stroke a fire fight between two classes, that's pretty sad.&quot;<br>
<br>
So far I have simply tried to explain why I belive your class is so hated, I do belive that was the topic of discussion in this tread, please clarify if I am wrong. because you class is hated for a simaler reason that mine is hated.  we share somthing of a kinship in that fact, but if you belive that to be trying to start a fight between the two. Well if you do I see somthing in your future . . . Prozac.<br>

When 8 or 9 set up in Rathe Mountains in the Giant Valley, refuse to pull their giants off to the side--instead rooting them up on the plateau, or when they do pull them off to the side, they somehow get pulled to the side I'm on, and parked 15 feet away from me.<br>

This isn't 1 or 2 druids.  It's not even the same 8 or 9.  It's stuff like this that gives your class a bad rep. <p><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/atl/d/a/dastorys/Pictures/Necsig.jpg>

Damn skippy necros and druids have something in common.  They're two of the all around "disliked" classes in EQ.  Necros and druids rated as one of the most eBay'd classes in EQ when it first started up - mostly because they were the easiest to get to 50/60.  Quadding or no, fear/kiting (or just soloing in general) is a very good way to get xp.  Druids get the quad-kite and root-n-rot combo, necros get fear/kite and root-n-rot.  Generally speaking, it wasn't until late-Kunark, early Velious that quad kiting really became a well used way of getting xp.<br>
<br>
As far as the "starting a fight" comment, it's actually something your fellow necro stated first:<br>
<i>Nakht said, "Ya know, not to rag you personally, but there's already enough hate on this board as it is. No need to harvest even more with your grim reaper and post it here."</i><br>
<br>
<i>"Why don’t you come back next time someone links you back to our boards. We’ll still be here."<br>
reading necro boards for about a year now, linked to this druid site = 1, at this rate, you might just be wrong about that. . . . </i><br>
<br>
Oh I'm sure you'll come back to read the outcome of this rant.  Rants are more enjoyable to participate in than a bland fact-to-fact conversation after all.  I'm all for debates - love them in real life; especially when you get a good conversation going between two knowledgeable parties.  In fact, we've got quite a few posters on the Druid's Grove that don't count the druid as their primary class, and quite honestly when they post in the General or Hunting Guide forums, they often add insight that we may not have always considered, and therefore the general knowledge pool of everyone involved is increased.  A good EQ player is someone who knows their class very well, but also knows how the other classes interact.  That's usually the difference between a good [class] player, and a good [overall] player.<br>
<br>
I'll tell you what, Umbrae - take a look around the other forums and read a few of the threads that <b>aren't</b> rants.  Hell, you might even feel like you could constructively contribute to one of them.<br>
<br>
I don't have much regard for people who follow threads or links and just do a all around "yeah, me too" and then never come back again.  It adds absolutely no substance to anything.  I'm sure everyone here can pick out three times off the top of their heads of when they've been trained by a druid.  I'm sure the same folks could pick out another three or four times that they've had a necro who FD'd near them dumping a mob on them.  Everyone's got horror stories and everyone's been trained.  It's not the mark of a bad class that it happens, it's the mark of a bad player.<br>
<br>
If I went online today and got trained by a quad kiting wizard who had to gate cause his pull got out of hand, yeah I'd be peeved.  If it happened to me every day for the next week by different wizards, yeah, I'd be really PO'd.  I might even come to the Druid's Grove and post about it at which point I'd prolly get a few Grover's who'd say they've had the same thing happen to them.  However, I wouldn't be stupid enough to go over to Graffe's and call all the wizards trainers.  Yeah, I'd probably still get a few wizards that'd agree with me, but for the most part, I'd probably get told where I could shove it.<br>
<br>
So you can come over to the Druid's Grove and troll in "Rants" whenever you'd like to.  That's what the forum's here for (except for the fella who posted a single image two posts up, deleting yours).<br>
<br>
If you feel satisfied just saying, "yeah, you guys suck," see you by and bye.<br>
<br>
The Necro/Druid classes make a truly evil xp partner pair that not many players utilize these days.  If you ever feel like coming back and sharing pointers or tips, or even thoughts in general not of a rant nature, we'll be here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uonail2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Onail2 </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333399>(7/2/02 6:41:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=672.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://discovirtual.uol.com.br/jpaulotarso/public/brasilT.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Thru my experience there are some very cool druids around but there are plenty of stupid ones.<br>
<br>
The problem is not with the class but with the hands hitting the keyboard.<br>
<br>
I am a firepot traveller and one day i gated to Tim Deep and decided to check raptors island exp. When i got there i saw plenty of raptors up and one druid medding on one side of the island. I picked up a spot to summon pet and everything. I pull one raptor and kill it, like 5 secs after that i get a tell from the stupid druid(this is the stupid kind):<br>
<br>
Drood tells you: Hey i am camping the big island!<br>
You tell druid: What? You can't claim a whole @#%$ island to yourself!!!<br>
Drood tells you: Why not? Everyone does it!<br>
<br>
Sad, truly sad... GREED ahhhhh, must....exp...tonight....i am.... bigger.... then ...jooo....get out..... of.....my ..... QUAD camp!!!<br>
<br>
But i do know some nice druids. Ok now i have a couple of tips on how to improve your image with the players overall:<br>
<br>
1st - When you are teleporting somewhere and you are not in a big hurry and you have spots left you could always do a /shout Port to xxxx leaving in 2 minutes, 2 spots open. This would DEFINETELY increase your charisma.<br>
<br>
2nd - When you are quadding, use the &quot;/shout&quot; to warn people in the zone about it. Make a macro and click it once in a while, or better link the macro to your opening quad spell to make it shout everytime.<br>
<br>
3rd - Don't be greedy, everyone in the game pays the same amount as you.<br>
<br>
These 3 tips are based on what the druids i consider very nice do when they play.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp<br>

<br>
Check out the post I made several hours ago in general EQ, under NWN.  Yes I did look arround.  had I found some other post intersting, and felt I could add input to it I would have.  yet I failed to find many of that nature thus far.<br>
I do this in my spare time at work. since thier was not any thing interesting in necro forms, I came over here, via link to one post, and browsed arround in others. Like I said, I used to read this form.  I still some time read the magicians tower, shammans crucible, graffs, monky bussness, Safe house, my server board (at least untill they banned my work domain recents =/), eqnecros, along with a few others. that does not leave alot of time for other message boards. I rarely post, as while working, typeing repies and explaning to some one how to get thier buessness backonline is much more difficult than simply reading and explaning.<br>
I am sorry if you think 1 / all of us are trolls because some one posted a link to your form on our class form.<br>
But I also did not know that people were requiered to read the non rant forms before postion / contributing to the rant's form.  in case I ever need to post to somthing in the rants fourm here I will remeber that, so that I can put a disclamer on my links.<br>
<br>
the issue tht was oringaly posted was concering somthing we have discussed serveral times, quaders kill necros probly more than any other single class. it is somthing that has been discussed before on the necro form, I see no reason that we should not add our coments here.<br>
Perhaps I am missing the point of your boards, since you obviouly get bent out of shape if some one who does not play a druid as thier main does not come here and post what you belive to be valuable information.  yet instead of leaving it alone you attack us for it and take our coments out of context.<br>
<br>
I fail to see one post before you jumped on us that said flat out druids suck. most simply pointed out that crappy players often choose druids to play.  yet the title of the thread we are posting in is titled &quot;The reason people hate us&quot; created by a druid on a druid message board.  not normaly the type of discussion I would put in the rants fourm, but the situation detailed was somthing of a rant.  I see no reason that another classess input would not be valued on such a topic, but apearently it is not.  would under normal circumstances leave such a topic free of replies, but some one had to bring some sence to the horibly crap that the aparently non troll druid idiots posted.  of course, this not coming from some one that reads here at least once a day, so you can compleatly invalidate our opinions over that of the regulars.  you know post counts make right!<br>
<br>
This might sound a bit harsh, for it is in nature, I would like to know why you felt you needed to attack us for simply posting on your forms.  Is thier a limit on necros that are on this form?  should we all go sit in the back of the bus, so that our horid mentality might not posion the pure thoughts of the regulars that read these boards?<br>
<br>

But sorry, I won't waste my time debating anyone about what Everquest class is better than another, Everquest is a game with the goal being to have fun.<br>
<br>
I never said I hated *druids* druids are polygonal characters in a computer world, I don't hate such things. I don't hate any ability that druids have I don't hate anything about the druid class. It's a fun class to play and they are usually not bad to have in group (as long as it's not one of the druids that sits there doing more or less nothing.)<br>
<br>
What I hate, is the people behind most druids. As most of those people are assholes.<br>
<br>
I'm just going from my own personal experiences, maybe I'm just incredibly unlucky in finding a lot of jackass players who decide to play druids.<br>
<br>
And I still agree with what I said about druids being a class that is so easy a lot of bad players gravitate towards it.<br>
<br>
I'll admit you guys have issues in the end game but most of the lame  players I'm referring to more or less move through EQ like it's a single player game, they quad all the way to 60 without grouping much at all, and the only gear they have is top of the line droppable which they bought from HG money, because they are socially incapable of being in a guild and raiding.<br>
<br>
And, hell I see a lot of necro's that are just like that spend all their time soloing and will never be in a guild for long because all they are interested in is farming more and buying more.<br>
<br>
But the difference between that lame @#%$ necro I described and that lame @#%$ druid I described is a simple one: I can be near a lame @#%$ necro in the grey and there's no problem there, he won't cause me any real trouble (never have had a necro train me) a lame @#%$ druid on the other hand will ruin my day by using up an insane amount of space to solo and run over me while I sit medding because they don't give a damn because EQ in their simple minds is in essence a single player game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#333399>(7/3/02 4:11:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=672.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I am sorry, was that meant to be concilliatory?<br>

You say you don't hate the pixels you see on the screen, but say MOST of the people who are behind them are assholes?<br>
<br>
Um...ok.<br>
<br>
I generally don't read the &quot;why all druids suck&quot; posts cuz they always say the same tired things.  &quot;This druid on this day did this thing to me and you are all like that.&quot;  You are greedy...you farm... you are solo players in an online world.  Sorry I have heard ALL of these things said about necros.<br>
<br>
I have done a lot of solo and group and guild raid in my 2 plus years of playing this game.  I have never seriously believed that one class was more likely to be populated by assholes or morons than another.  I have seen pitiful, pathetic, immature and fairly reprehensible things done by players in most classes at this point.  <br>
<br>
If you don't like druids so much, why come here and tell us about it?   Sorry I doubt very much that most of us are very interested.  We have heard it all before when we refused to do that port cuz we just did 3 and want to actually play some for ourselves now.  Or get accused of greed or bad behavior because we are already in a camp someone else wants.<br>
<br>
But as someone else in one of these threads already stated, at least this is the right place for a rant.  What exactly do you expect to come of it though?<br>

My personal 3 years experience is different, as I would tend to say that the majority of (high) level druids are awesome people, although there are a few jerks. I have never met a high level druid as described by the original poster. Maybe I am lucky because of the server I play on, but I don't think so.<br>
