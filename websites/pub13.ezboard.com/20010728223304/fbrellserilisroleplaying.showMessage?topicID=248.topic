<br>
&quot;Hi mommy! We're home!&quot; Maella shouted as she entered the tavern. She ignored the few patrons sitting around the room and ran straight to the kitchen at the back of the building. Mayt smiled. It didn't seem to matter what his daughter did, it always brought a smile to his face. He followed Maella to the kitchen, slowly working his way through the tables. He paused as he reached the table where an older Wood Elf sat, sipping at his drink by himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings Jorgatha. It is nice to see you again.&quot; He smiled and nodded at the older Wood Elf. &quot;How has your son been? I had heard he was not feeling well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jorgatha finished a long pull at the mug in his hand and set it down on the table, his hands cradling it. He looked intently at this drink for a moment, as if he was steeling himself to speak. Finally he looked up at Mayt, his green eyes filled with sadness. &quot;The Mother has called him to her side, Mayt. He no longer walks the Faydark.&quot; His voice was thick with emotion and he couldn’t hold his gaze on Mayt for long before returning his eyes to the mug he was rotating slowly with his hands.<br>
<br>
Mayt's face fell but he struggled to keep his emotions in check. &quot;I am extremely sorry to hear that, friend.” He said quietly. “The last I had heard it looked as though he would recover from his ordeal at the hands of the Orcs. I cannot effectively convey my sorrow. I truly am sorry.&quot; He put his hand on Jorgatha's shoulder in an effort to comfort him. The older Elf responded by putting his hand on top of Mayt's.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you for your kind words Mayt.” He said, turning his head to look at him again. “I take some comfort in knowing he's with Tunare now, and finally at peace.”<br>
<br>
Mayt nodded again and squeezed his friend's shoulder. A shudder ran through him as he briefly contemplated the possibility of losing Maella. She was an enormous part of his life now, and the mere thought of her death nearly brought tears to his eyes. The world is too cruel a place, he thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;If there might be something Ianarae or myself can do, please do not hesitate to ask. We know what it is like to have a child, and thank Erollisi and Tunare every day for her safety. We feel your pain in our hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jorgatha smiled, his lips tight, and simply nodded. Mayt squeezed his shoulder again and continued to the kitchen.<br>
<br>
Inside the kitchen he found his beautiful wife, Ianarae, and his father Tyle. He moved behind Ianarae, who was busy with dishes, and hugged her warmly. She kept her hands in the sink but turned her head toward him and kissed him lightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maella tells me she had a good time today with her Daddy,&quot; she said as Mayt reached for a drying towel.<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled. “Yes, I think we did. The fay drakes are most likely relieved to be rid of us so they can have some peace.” He glanced at his father across the room, standing in front of the stove. &quot;She tells me that her grandfather has offered to make her anything she wishes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maella was sitting on the counter beside the sink, swinging her legs against the cupboard below. &quot;Yup, and I want pick cold gator and bat crunches&quot; she said happily.<br>
<br>
Ianarae looked at Mayt and then at Tyle who was busy mixing a stew in a large pot on the stove.<br>
<br>
&quot;Father,” she began, “you must stop spoiling her like this. Soon she won't eat anything but batwing crunchies and pickled gator.&quot; Ianarae's voice was light and teasing.<br>
<br>
Tyle stopped stirring long enough to pull the large wooden spoon out of the stew and place it to his lips. He turned to look at Ianarae while he sipped at its contents.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's my job to spoil her,&quot; he said hoarsely, his voice barely a whisper. &quot;I'm her grandfather, after all. If I don't spoil her, who will?&quot; He paused, considering his creation thoughtfully as he rolled it around his mouth. He frowned, turned toward the stove and reached for a jar of spices above the stove.<br>
<br>
Ianarae sighed and looked at Mayt again, the facade of a frown on her face. &quot;Her father does well enough at spoiling her. Between the two of you, I doubt she will grow up with any manners whatsoever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my daughter,&quot; he said, his voice rasping as he stirred the stew, &quot;that is your problem - not mine.&quot; He reached up to his neck and absently rubbed at the ugly scar running across his throat. &quot;Her grandmother isn't here, so I must do the work of two grandparents.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayt shrugged at Ianarae and grabbed a wet plate from the drying rack. His wife sighed and returned to her washing. As he finished drying the first plate he placed it on the shelf above the sink and then looked over to his father with concern.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your voice sounds a bit weak today Father. Are you feeling alright?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyle grumbled at the stove inaudibly as a young High Elf entered the kitchen, a tray on her hand. <br>
<br>
She laughed lightly and said &quot;He can't talk today because he spent most of last night drinking with his old friends.&quot; She looked at Tyle with a wry smile. &quot;And the singing didn't help much either, I'd guess.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tyle glanced at her and grumbled again. &quot;Don't I pay you to be waiting on tables?&quot; he asked, sarcasm melding in his raspy voice.<br>
<br>
She placed the tray on the counter at the side and tilted her head at Tyle. &quot;Well, I would, if I had any stew to serve them, but the cook seems to be taking longer than usual perfecting his art today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyle grumbled again as the High Elf giggled. Ianarae joined her laughter and said, &quot;I think it’s more than just his stew that’s a bit slow today, Cyrileal. Too much ale makes an old Elf a bit dull-witted.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; Cyrileal agreed. &quot;And old Songwhisper was drinking enough ale to keep him singing well into the night.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled at his father and the way the two women badgered him. He hadn't seen his father this light hearted in many years, possibly ever. Although he was too young to remember it, he knew very well how drastically his father's life had changed almost one hundred years ago during the orc invasion of Kelethin. His father had been, at that time, a well-known Bard, and he fought bravely defending Kelethin. He paid dearly for the defense that day, however, when an orc's blade nearly took his life. He lived, but the orc's foul weapon all but destroyed his voice. Although he was famous as one of the only High Elves to ever become a songweaver, his career as a Bard ended that day. <br>
<br>
Tyle's injuries went far beyond the physical. His wife, his sister and her husband were killed in that battle. He thought his niece had also died and only found out recently that she had survived. Without his voice, and without a family, Tyle retired from the life he'd loved so much and took over the Torvanni's Venom tavern in Felwithe. Even though his voice had been reduced to a quiet rasp, he continued to sing, especially to the patrons of the Venom, and soon acquired the moniker &quot;Songwhisper&quot;. To this day all his friends and customers called him by the name. His whispering added a plaintive touch to all his songs and gave even the most uplifting lyrics a mournful tone.<br>
<br>
Tyle had been a difficult father, and Mayt often wondered if he could ever earn his respect. Unfortunately, in his grief Tyle became desperate for a son that would carry on the family tradition. Mayt’s mother, Ghaiayna, was an accomplished Cleric, and so was Tyle’s mother, Mayet, whom Mayt was named for. After Ghaiayna’s death, Tyle became obsessed with having a Cleric in the family and pushed Mayt to become a Cleric of Tunare. Unfortunately, Mayt failed spectacularly as a Cleric, and his father brooded on this failure for most of his son’s life. It wasn’t until shortly before Mayt married Ianarae that Tyle finally accepted his son for what he was. The addition of Maella to the family only brightened Tyle’s life more, and Mayt marveled daily at the affect his daughter had on Tyle’s disposition. Smiling to himself, he placed another dry plate on the shelf with the others.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ianarae put the last dish on the drying rack, wiped her hands on a towel and gave Mayt a quick hug.<br>
<br>
&quot;I need to go to the market and get some good food,&quot; she said and then shot a stern look at her father in law. &quot;Our daughter needs to eat more than just batwing crunchies, and our customers will be wanting bread with the newest Songwhisper stew masterpiece.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mayt grabbed the last dish and started drying it. &quot;I shall come with you then, dear. I need to visit my guild for a few moments.&quot; He looked at Maella who had moved over to sit on a stool beside her grandfather. &quot;Can you watch Maella while we are gone father?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As long as you don't mind me spoiling her,&quot; he croaked sarcastically.<br>
<br>
“And if he’s too busy with his stew, I’ll make sure she’s taken care of,” Cyrileal said as she left the kitchen for the common room.<br>
<br>
Ianarae started to leave but stopped and turned back to her husband. She reached out and pulled the drying towl from where Mayt had left it on his shoulder. “Are you planning on washing dishes at your guild hall as well?” <br>
<br>
Mayt looked surprised to see the towel on his shoulder. “Oh,” he said. “I forgot I was carrying that around with me.” He grinned weakly at his wife.<br>
<br>
Ianarae laughed and led him out of the kitchen, his hand in hers.  <br>

<br>
It was the way the voice said his name that made Mayt stop in the hallway to listen to the conversation. There was something odd about the voice – something not quite right.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mayt? Yes, of course I know him. He is one of our accomplished students.&quot; Mayt recognized the voice of his teacher Master Tarker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is he the one who had the difficulty when he was younger?&quot; the voice asked. Something about the way the person behind the voice asked the question made Mayt feel uncomfortable, even vulnerable.<br>
<br>
“Yes, we found out about Mayt when he was a child and, at that time, he was having much difficulty with controlling his magical energies.” Tarker answered. “Why do you ask?”<br>
<br>
&quot;It is very important that I speak to him as soon as possible.&quot; The stranger's voice was calm and measured, yet there was an urgency about his voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why would that be?&quot; Tarker asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not something I want to discuss at this time, but it is very important, as I already said.&quot;<br>
<br>
“I have not seen him this day, but his family runs a tavern in Felwithe called Torvanni’s Venom. I am sure you would find him there, or, at the least, find more information regarding his whereabouts.”<br>
<br>
Mayt’s heart skipped a beat.<br>
<br>
“Thank you. You have been most helpful.” Mayt could imagine the owner of the voice was smiling. From the accent he thought he might be from the far west coast of Antonica, maybe even Erudin.<br>
<br>
“Good luck to you then,” Tarker said. <br>
<br>
Mayt heard footsteps from behind a door moving toward the hallway he was in. Something about the situation made him feel uncomfortable so he quickly cast an invisibility spell and moved quietly off to one side of the hall. A moment later a door opened into the corridor and a tall, powerfully built Erudite stepped through. He walked down the hallway toward Mayt, great confidence in his stride. As he passed Mayt, oblivious to the Elf’s presence, he pulled a light hood over his dark hair and shifted his cloak around his body. Within the swirl of fabric Mayt saw the glint of metal on a mighty sword hanging from the man’s belt. From his brief glance, he was impressed by the sheer size of the weapon. The man was tall, for an Erudite, but the sword hung nearly to his calf, and the handle reached high above his waist.<br>
<br>
Mayt stood deathly still as the man walked by but allowed his eyes to follow him as he continued down the hall. His boots made a loud clicking sound as they struck the worn stones that formed the guildhall floor. As soon as the stranger was out of sight and earshot Mayt allowed himself to breathe again, hurried down the hall to the room he’d just seen the man exit from and went in. Dropping his invisibility spell, he greeted his former teacher.<br>
<br>
“Greetings Master Tarker,” Mayt said with a deep bow of respect. “How does the day please you?”<br>
<br>
The teacher looked surprised to see his old student. “Why Mayt! How unusual! I was just talking about you. An Erudite left here not two minutes ago. He was inquiring about you. He would not say what his business was, but he insisted he see you as soon as possible. I sent him to the Venom. If you hurry, you might catch him.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Master. Do you know this Erudite?” He asked.<br>
<br>
The older Elf shook his head. “No, Mayt, I do not know him. He just left, son. I am sure you could catch him.”<br>
<br>
Mayt bowed. “Thank you teacher. I shall endeavor to catch him then.” He turned to leave, stopped, and turned around to face his old teacher again. “Master?” he asked.<br>
<br>
Tarker tilted his head curiously. “Yes my son?”<br>
<br>
“Did this Erudite seem …” Mayt struggled to find the right words. “Dangerous?”<br>
<br>
Tarker scratched his chin absently. “Dangerous?” he repeated. He shrugged and said, “I do not think so, Mayt. But I suppose he did look like a battle-hardened warrior, I guess – if that is what you mean. Should I have not sent him to the Venom?” he asked, somewhat uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
“No, no,” Mayt reassured him. “I am sure he means no harm.” He forced a smile and bowed again. “Thank you for your time Master.” He turned and went out the door.<br>
<br>
As Mayt left the room, his mind was whirling with questions about the stranger. One thing he was sure of: the Erudite was a fighting man, and in these things he was himself poor. If his intuitions were correct regarding this man then he’d better work quickly and beat him back to his home. He couldn’t place what it was about the Erudite that made him nervous, but he knew for sure that he didn’t want the stranger reaching the Venom before he was there. If there was going to be trouble, he didn’t want his father defending his home by himself. What he needed, he thought, was some martial aid. Mayt was a skilled wizard, and a deadly foe, but when it came to arms and armor, he was as weak as a child. He immediately thought of his good friend Vaal, who was currently in Felwithe. If there was fighting to be done, Mayt wanted Vaal at his side. He broke into a jog toward the Paladin’s guild house where he knew he’d find him.<br>

<br>
The flickering light from the candles danced and fenced with the darkness, waging a private war of acquisition, at once advancing and losing ground, in a constant flux of territory. The mother lay on her back in the center of the room on a bed of silver silk sheets, her hair in disarray about her shoulders. Two midwives busied themselves around the mother in silence; words were unneeded between two women whose experience spanned more than thirty generations of Elven birthing.<br>
<br>
In the corner, as far away from the three women as possible so as not to get in their way, Tyle watched calmly as he strummed his lyre quietly. He marveled at how, even in the midst of childbirth, his wife could look so stunningly beautiful. Even with her legs splayed at awkward angles, her hair tousled and her belly swollen with child she was the most elegant woman he knew. His fingers moved effortlessly on the frets of his instrument but his eyes never strayed from his wife. Soon the pains of childbirth, along with the awkwardness and tension of the moment, would evaporate like cool rain on sun-baked rock and he would be a father. A father! He sighed deeply at the thought. This was to be the culmination of his life; he would have a son!<br>
<br>
Ghaiayna moaned quietly, her discomfort growing with every breath. Even Elven births could cause difficulty for the mother, although they had nowhere near the complications afflicting the lesser races. Tyle found himself grimacing slightly as his wife cried out, obviously in pain. Her body stiffened and her face was a mixture of pain and concentration. The Bard stopped his song and quickly began another, his fingers moving with expert grace along the strings. A warm glow of magical lights bathed the room and the four Elves as Tyle’s song surrounded them. Ghaiayna responded instantly to the magical music and relaxed visibly, her sweat-slicked body sinking back into the silk covered bed. The midwife at Ghaiayna’s head drew a moist cloth over the mother’s forehead and patted it along her cheeks and neck as she directed a small smile to Tyle, clearly approving his music.<br>
<br>
The woman at Ghaiayna’s feet whispered something to her, and a few moments later Tyle saw his wife straining. The time was near. He changed his tune slightly, adding a completely different set of notes to the song he was playing. The songs blended with each other smoothly, the new one sending a surge of strength and energy into his wife. She strained again, a small groan of exertion escaping her lips. Her hands clenched in fists and she lifted her back off the bed, pushing with the encouragement of the two midwives. Long moments later the second midwife announced with enthusiasm that she could see the baby’s head. The first midwife encouraged Ghaiayna to continue and grabbed her hands firmly in her own. The mother strained again, her entire body flexing rigidly, a long guttural grunt emanating from her lungs.<br>
<br>
Tyle stood and waited with rapt anticipation. He watched as the second midwife guided his child out of his wife’s body with practiced ease and gentleness. Seconds later his child forced breath into his lungs and expelled it with a shrill cry. Holding his lyre in one hand, he moved to his new son, his eyes sparkling with happiness. The midwife wrapped the child in a warm blanket and held him out for the Bard to hold. Tyle laid his lyre on the bed and accepted the child with open arms. He stared dumbfounded at the tiny, fragile being in his hands, staring amazedly at the child’s delicate hands as one wrapped around his finger. Carefully he moved to sit beside his wife and placed the baby in her arms. Ghaiayna held the newborn lovingly and kissed his head lightly. <br>
<br>
Tyle smiled broadly at his wife and leaned to kiss her. “My love, say hello to our new son.”<br>
<br>
Ghaiayna smiled dreamily and returned her husband’s kiss. “Hello Mayt,” she said quietly.<br>

<br>
“Mayt? No, but he should be back soon. Can I get something for you till he returns?” Ianarae’s voice was muffled, coming from behind the door.<br>
<br>
Mayt opened the door to the Venom quickly and burst into the inn with Vaal closely behind him. Inside he saw Ianarae standing before the tall erudite he had seen earlier that afternoon. His cloak was pulled back to reveal the massive sword on his hip, gripped lightly in his hand. They both turned toward the door when it opened. The erudite looked at Mayt with hard eyes as the he walked toward his wife. He gave Vaal a sidelong glance as Mayt put his arm protectively around Ianarae.<br>
<br>
“You must be Mayt,” the Erudite said, his voice low and serious.<br>
<br>
“Yes I am,” Mayt said and then looked over at Vaal who was walking slowly toward the group of three. Mayt had caught Vaal during afternoon arms practice and the Paladin had followed Mayt to the inn quickly without changing out of his battle armor. His friend was clothed from foot to neck in metal armor and he wore his prized sword “Ghoulbane” on his hip. As he approached the others, Vaal focused his stern gaze on the Erudite and calmly placed his hand on the pommel of his sword, matching the Erudite’s silent expression of power with his own. He stopped beside Mayt and turned to stare placidly at the tall man.<br>
<br>
“Have you met my good friend Vaal?” Mayt asked his voice slightly tense.<br>
<br>
The erudite bowed slightly toward Vaal and then Mayt. “It’s my pleasure to meet you finally Mayt,” he said, overtly avoiding any comment toward the Paladin. “My name is Emeroun, and I have been sent to find you.”<br>
<br>
“Find me?” Mayt said. He was taken aback; he didn’t expect the Erudite, or anyone else, to be looking for him.<br>
<br>
“I suppose you have accomplished that goal then. Why is it you, or anyone else, wishes to find me?”<br>
<br>
Emeroun’s eyes flickered to Vaal and then returned to Mayt. “I can’t really go into it right now, Mayt, but I need to take you back to Erudin as soon as possible. We must leave this day.”<br>
<br>
“What?” Mayt said, stunned. He looked at Ianarae who looked back at him with concern.<br>
<br>
Vaal cleared his throat and shifted his weight. “Nobody’s going anywhere at this time, Emeroun.” He crossed his arms on his chest to emphasize his point. Mayt smiled internally. When it came to being resolute, Vaal was unmatched.<br>
<br>
Emeroun scowled and paused, as if considering his next course of action. His face grew darker, and he worked his jaw slowly. Finally he spoke.<br>
<br>
“Fools! I don’t have time to stand around and argue with a bunch of stubborn Koada’dal!” <br>
<br>
He reached out to grab Mayt’s hand in his, but before he could reach the Wizard Vaal’s hand intercepted his. The Paladin held the man’s wrist tightly in his gauntleted fist and glared at him darkly. <br>
<br>
“I said, nobody’s going anywhere at this time. And I meant it!” He moved toward the man and stood mere inches from him, his hand still on Emeroun’s wrist. When he spoke his mouth barely opened. “Now you have two choices, Erudite. Either you can turn around and leave, or we can settle this the hard way.”<br>
<br>
Emeroun returned Vaal’s gaze silently with one equal in sternness.  The dark skin on his face rippled as he clenched his jaw, his fingers playing tentatively with the pommel of his sword. Finally, after many seconds of thick silence, he pulled his hand away from Vaal’s grip roughly and backed up. He tore his gaze from Vaal and glared at Mayt. He narrowed his eyes and spoke waveringly, through clenched teeth, obviously furious. “You will regret this, Koada’dal!” He then turned, whirling his cloak about him as he did, and strode quickly out of the inn.<br>
<br>
As soon as the door swung shut Ianarae grasped her husband in relief, holding him tightly. “What does he want from you?” She asked. <br>
<br>
Mayt looked at Vaal and sensed the same question in his friend’s eyes. He turned his eyes to the floor. “I have no idea,” he said weakly. “I just have no idea.”<br>
<br>
“Well, chances are he won’t be bothering you in the near future,” Vaal said. “But just to be safe, I think Lileah and I should stay here for a few days. If he does return, we’ll be here to change his mind.”<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled at his friend. He could always count on Vaal. “Vaal, I cannot thank you enough for coming here. Without your presence, I am not sure how this might have turned out.”<br>
<br>
Vaal chuckled. “I’m sure you would have done fine Mayt, but I’m glad I was here to help. You would have done the same for me.”<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled again and then looked around, fear flashing across his face. “Where is Maella?” he asked as he looked around the room. “Is she alright?”<br>
<br>
“I left her with her grandfather in the kitchen, Mayt,” Ianarae said. “I’m sure she’s fine.”<br>
<br>
Mayt hurried to the swinging doors that separated the common room from the kitchen and went through them as he called out his daughter’s name. “Maella? Where are you dear?”<br>
<br>
“Right here daddy,” she answered. “Grandpa made me some grape juice. Mayt found her in the kitchen sitting on a stool in front of the long table used to prepare food. Tyle was sitting across from her. They each had a glass of grape juice in front of them. His father looked at Mayt curiously.<br>
<br>
Mayt’s body sagged in relief as his wife entered the kitchen. It was times like these, when there was some imagined threat to his daughter, that he realized with clarity, how much she meant to him. His wife put a hand on his shoulder. <br>
<br>
“Mayt,” she said quietly, “let’s go downstairs to our room and talk about this Erudite with Vaal.”<br>
<br>
Mayt turned and nodded at his wife. As Ianarae followed him out into the common room she called over her shoulder, “We’ll be back in a few minutes Father. Then we can start to prepare for the evening crowd.”<br>
<br>
When they were downstairs in their room Ianarae looked at the two men and said, “I don’t know why, but I just get a bad feeling about this Emeroun. There’s something about him that makes me uncomfortable.”<br>
<br>
“I know dear. I do not trust him either,” Mayt said as he ran a hand through his hair nervously. “I overheard him having a conversation with Tarker Blazetoss while I walked through my guildhall. He wanted to know where I was, and when Master Tarker told him that I could be found at the Venom, I avoided him and ran to get Vaal.” <br>
<br>
“What did you hear Mayt? Did he say anything that might suggest why he wants you to go to Erudin?” Ianarae asked.<br>
 <br>
Mayt paused and thought a moment. “He asked a most strange question. He asked Master Tarker if I was the one who had trouble with control when I was younger.”<br>
<br>
Ianarae looked at Vaal to see if the information meant anything to him. Vaal just shrugged.<br>
<br>
“How odd,” she said. “What possible reason could an Erudite have interest in you because of your sickness?”<br>
<br>
“Maybe he’s studying a way to cause the sickness in others,” Vaal suggested. “There are many evil Necromancers in Paineel, and Tunare knows they are determined to destroy all the good in the world.”<br>
<br>
Mayt was shaking his head slowly. “I just cannot see why anyone would want to do that. It is not like it would cause anyone anything but pain and suffering.”<br>
<br>
Vaal folded his arms. “Maybe his goal is to cause more pain and suffering Mayt. Many people in this world have that as their main purpose in life.”<br>
<br>
Mayt sighed heavily and sat down on his bed, his eyes dropping to the floor. “I suppose you are right Vaal. I just never expected to be sought after because of some frailty that manifested itself in my childhood. I do suppose that it does still cause me great discomfort at times.”<br>
<br>
Ianarae sighed and put her hands on Mayt’s shoulders. “Don’t worry dear. We’ll make sure they don’t take you off to Erudin, even if they just want you to taste test the latest batch of brandy.”<br>
<br>
Vaal looked at Mayt, his face expressionless. “No, Mayt. We won’t.”<br>

<br>
The day had been awful. Six hours ago the alarm had been raised throughout Kelethin, warning the Wood Elves that they were under attack. Mayt and his parents had been on their way to visit his aunt and uncle in the Wood Elf city. He always looked forward to the visits his family made to the city in the trees. His aunt, Airelil, always had delicious treats for him whenever he visited, and he always had fun playing with his cousin Lileah. His mother and father had been in high spirits as they made the journey through the Faydark to Kelethin, as they always were when they made the visits.<br>
<br>
But everything had gone wrong. Now Mayt was sitting in a large room in Felwithe with dozens of other High Elf children. He had been whisked away as soon as his parents heard the alarm sounding throughout the forest, and like the other children waiting in the room, he was tired, hungry and bored. The stone floor had ceased to be comfortable over four hours ago and there was nothing to do. Mayt had heard the word ‘Orcs’ mentioned quite a few times, but he didn’t really know much about orcs. The only thing he could remember was his mother telling him to ‘be good’ as she kissed him on the top of his head. He wasn’t entirely sure how he could be good right now, but he was trying his best. Initially only the older children seemed more upset than frustrated, but now most of the children had joined them in their concern and a sense of gloom had descended on the room. <br>
<br>
To worsen his mood, every few minutes someone he didn’t know would come into the room and call out one or more of the children, always from the same family, and take them away. Sometimes Mayt heard distant crying a few minutes after they were taken away, and it made him feel even more uncomfortable even though he didn’t even know why he felt so sad. At times he himself wanted to cry, but he didn’t know why. He wasn’t the only one; at least a quarter of the children in the room were crying or sniffling.<br>
 <br>
A young Wood Elf appeared in the doorway to the room and asked nervously, “Is Mayt here?” <br>
<br>
Mayt looked up from the stones he was sitting on and tentatively put up his hand. “I am Mayt,” he said, his voice weak from the tears fighting their way past his eyes.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf approached Mayt slowly, a weak, forced smile on his face. He bent over at his waist when he was close to Mayt and spoke to him quietly. “Mayt? Are your parents Ghaiayna and Tyle?” He asked fidgeting nervously with his pant leg.<br>
<br>
Mayt was struck with an overwhelming sense of wrongness, as if the world had just done something very nasty, something mean. He looked at the Wood Elf with wide eyes and blinked a few times, his eyes watery with fear. “Yes. My father is Tyle and my mother is Ghaiayna.” Mayt blinked again. He was scared. He knew something was dreadfully wrong. He was too small for such a big world. He sniffled and remembered he was supposed to ‘be good’.<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf tried smiling again and barely managed the task. He reached down and offered his hand to Mayt. “My name is Pith. Could you come with me for a little walk, Mayt?” He asked softly.<br>
<br>
Mayt nodded quietly gave his hand to the other Elf and stood up slowly, his head spinning. His stomach was a giant knot. He let Pith lead him out of the room and down a long hall to a large open wooden door. The world seemed to be moving in slow motion, and the Wood Elf’s body blended in with the stone of the walls and the wood of the door. He felt himself being led into a small room where an older-looking High Elf male was sitting in a chair beside a female Wood Elf.<br>
<br>
“This is Mayt, Yeolorn.” Pith said. “His parents are Tyle and Ghaiayna.”<br>
<br>
The Elf named Yeolorn raised an eyebrow and looked at the woman beside him. “Then Kerean and Airelil are his uncle and aunt?”<br>
<br>
The Wood Elf female nodded at Yeolorn and then turned a soft, sad smile on Mayt. “How old are you Mayt?” she asked, her voice friendly.<br>
<br>
“Four.” He said. “Almost five now.” The tears came again, even though he was trying so hard to hold them back. He had to be good. His mother had told him to be good. Maybe he wasn’t supposed to cry. He tried harder.<br>
<br>
“My, my! You look like a big boy for your age!” she said.<br>
<br>
The world began to blur into a haze around Mayt. He was barely aware of the three adults in the room as they told him about the Orc raid on Kelethin, and the results of the battle. His head was spinning as Yeolorn told him his father was alive, but badly hurt, and that Tunare would look after him. He barely heard the woman speak over the rushing sound in his ears, and was numbly aware that his mother was dead, killed by an orc. He clenched his hands into tight little fists and listened quietly. Was it his fault that his mother had been hurt? He had tried to be good. The room was spinning faster and faster around him as she spoke and he only barely understood that his aunt, uncle and cousin were dead as well. A thick darkness filled his vision as the three of them explained that their sacrifice had saved Kelethin, and how they were heroes. <br>
<br>
His cheeks were wet with tears but he couldn’t see anyway as the darkness filled him. The room spun, then flipped and flopped, and he fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
He could barely feel the woman’s arms around him when she knelt beside him. He dimly heard her whisper “it’s ok”. <br>
<br>
Through tears he choked “I was good… I tried to be good.”<br>
<br>
He felt her arms tighten around him. She was shaking too, and he thought he heard her crying. Maybe her mother had been hurt too.<br>

<br>
Three days after the strange Erudite had visited the inn, Mayt was cleaning up after the last few customers, wiping tables and carrying dishes back to the kitchen. The last customer had left half an hour ago and Mayt had sent the others to bed while he finished closing the Venom. He liked closing the inn because it was so peaceful at night. The common room seemed to hum with the after-glow of all the people who had been there during the evening. The people were gone, but, to Mayt, it seemed as though a part of their person had been left behind and it lingered for a few hours. He placed another two mugs from a table on top of the large tray he was carrying and started toward the kitchen. Just as he reached the swinging doors he heard the front door to the inn open. He continued into the kitchen to drop off the glasses and plates on his tray but when he heard the door close, followed by the sound of boots on the wooden floor, he called out from the kitchen.<br>
<br>
“I am sorry friend. We are closed for the night,” He shouted from behind the swinging doors. When there was no response he left his tray in the kitchen and went back into the common room, expecting to find a drunken customer looking for a final mug of ale before he went to bed. He passed the swinging doors and froze. There, in the middle of the common room, was Emeroun. His sword in hand, he was moving quietly toward the kitchen. Mayt found his voice and spoke loudly.<br>
<br>
“I said we are closed for the night Emeroun. You will have to leave now.”<br>
<br>
The Erudite continued toward Mayt, a snarl on his face. “I told you before that you had to come with me, and I wasn’t joking around and you WILL come with me now. I’ve sworn to bring you to Erudin, and I’ll be damned if some high and mighty Koada’dal is going to stop me.”<br>
<br>
Mayt flashed his hands through the complex movements of an attack spell as the man started toward him. If he could get off a spell quickly enough, he might survive. Emeroun broke into a run when he saw the wizard casting and was nearly on him when he was struck with the full fury of magical fire. As the fire tore at his skin, the Erudite cried out in pain, but he recovered quickly and raised his sword to strike at the High Elf. Mayt used the Erudite’s moment of indecision to quickly cast a mini-teleportation spell and was instantaneously moved across the room just as Emeroun’s sword crashed down on the spot he had been standing, rending one of the wooden swinging doors and ripping it off its hinges with a loud crash. Mayt realized with some surprise that the Erudite had directed the flat part of his blade at him. The realization that Emeroun wasn’t trying to kill him did little to comfort Mayt, however, and he began casting another attack spell as soon as he oriented himself after teleporting.<br>
<br>
With a grunt, the dark skinned warrior launched himself at Mayt, running two steps and then leaping across the remaining distance in an attempt to reach the wizard before he finished casting his spell. He struck Mayt squarely in his chest, knocking both of them to the floor. The Erudite scrambled up Mayt’s body till he had the Elf pinned to the ground, his hands on his shoulders. He was extremely strong and Mayt’s attempts to remove himself from his grasp were futile.<br>
<br>
“Now stop fighting me and I won’t have to smack you across the head,” he growled as he dropped his sword to the floor and grabbed both of Mayt’s wrists. Holding both of Mayt’s hands in his much larger left hand, the warrior reached to his hip with his right hand and pulled a rope from his belt. Mayt struggled impotently as his hands were bound together quickly. He tried squirming free by rolling on his stomach and felt a strong hand on his shoulder pulling him back. A moment later a loud crack rang out in the room and the Erudite fell off him to the side. <br>
<br>
Mayt scrambled off his stomach and sat up. There, standing above him, was Vaal, sword in hand, dressed in a sleeping shirt. The paladin took a quick look at his friend to make sure he was ok, and then moved to Emeroun who had fallen beside Mayt. Before he could move, the Erudite struck out with his armored boot, catching Vaal in the groin. Vaal gasped, releasing air from his lungs and bent slightly, stunned momentarily. He recovered a second later, but a second was all the warrior needed to place a second boot to Vaal’s knee, knocking the paladin off balance and causing him to fall backwards, landing on his Mayt.<br>
Emeroun wasted no time scrambling to his feet and using his enemy’s momentary disorientation to run from the inn. By the time Vaal was back to his feet, the Erudite was gone.<br>
<br>
Vaal grimaced and forced air back into his lungs, sitting down heavily beside Mayt. He reached for the rope around his friend’s hands and began untying it.  Mayt blinked Vaal with a look of surprise.<br>
<br>
“Thank you, again, my friend. You have doubtless saved my life.”<br>
<br>
Vaal scowled. “I did no such thing, and I let him get away.” Vaal was never one to accept a compliment. Once the rope was untied he stood up and leaned on a table. “Next time he won’t be so lucky. Next time I’ll be prepared.” He swore softly to himself.<br>
<br>
“He may have gotten away, Vaal, but I am still here, and I am very grateful for that.” He placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder. “He had my hands tied by the time you showed up. Twenty more seconds and I might have never seen you or my family ever again.” <br>
<br>
Vaal stood and offered Mayt a hand. The Wizard accepted it and got to his feet sluggishly. He reached behind his head and rubbed a tender spot.<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart? Is everything alright?” Ianarae was standing at the foot of the stairs with Lileah behind her. Both were wearing their nightclothes.<br>
<br>
Mayt tried to smile but failed. “Yes, dear. Thanks to Vaal.” Mayt looked over at his friend and noticed he had picked up Emeroun’s sword and was examining it closely, holding it in his hands. “Vaal managed to arrive at the most critical time and drive Emeroun off once again.”<br>
<br>
The women moved into the room and embraced their husbands, relieved to know they were alright. Lileah hugged Vaal and looked down at the sword in his hands. He seemed to be puzzled by it.<br>
<br>
“Vaal?” She said quietly. “What is so special about the sword?”<br>
<br>
Vaal jerked his head up from the blade. “What?” he said, distractedly.<br>
<br>
“The sword, dear,” Lileah smiled. “Why are you so interested in it?” She asked.<br>
<br>
Vaal turned and looked at Mayt. “This sword,” he said slowly, “is not a warrior’s sword.”<br>
<br>
Mayt tilted his head and furrowed his brow. “Not a warrior’s sword? Are you saying Emeroun is a foul Knight of Shadow?”<br>
<br>
Vaal shook his head slowly. “No,” he said simply. “This sword does not belong to a Shadow Knight.”<br>
<br>
Mayt looked around at the others, puzzled. Lileah and Ianarae looked just as confused as he felt. “Well then? If it is not a warrior’s blade, and not a Shadow Knight’s, then what kind of weapon is it?”<br>
<br>
Vaal looked across the room to the door the Erudite had fled through, his face thoughtful. “This is a Paladin’s weapon,” he said quietly.<br>

<br>
“Now Mayt, you must be on your absolute best behavior while you’re with the Clerics.” Tyle said hoarsely. “Master Yeolorn has agreed to meet you and take you into the guild so that you may become a Cleric.”<br>
<br>
Mayt nodded quietly. “I will father,” he said, trying to remain calm and control his excitement.  They were standing just outside the Cleric guildhall, a few feet from the entrance. Tyle was on one knee before Mayt, his hands on his son’s shoulders.<br>
<br>
“Remember Mayt, your mother was a great Cleric, and so was your grandmother. You too will be a great Cleric,” Tyle said. His voice was forced and sounded painful.<br>
<br>
Mayt nodded again, his eyes darting around the guildhall entrance. Today he was going to be a Cleric! Ever since his father had recovered from his injury he constantly told Mayt that he was going to be a Cleric like his mother. His father had become obsessed with the idea over the three years since the battle at Kelethin. The damage to his throat was severe enough that no Cleric could heal him enough for him to regain his beautiful voice, thus ending his career as a songweaver. In response, Tyle had fallen into a deep depression lasting well over two years. As his savings dwindled his depression deepened, until finally, without any sign or warning, he snapped out of it. That day he left the small room in the inn that had been their home for the last year and went in search of a life. With the little money he had left he managed to work a deal to purchase the Venom. The next day he moved his son, hired a full staff and began his career as innkeeper.<br>
<br>
With his adventuring days officially over, Tyle yearned to live vicariously through Mayt, and started speaking of how he would one day become a great Cleric who would follow in his mother’s footsteps. For some reason, he never suggested that Mayt should become a Bard. Mayt wasn’t sure why. Maybe it was because he was only one-quarter Wood Elf unlike his father who was half Wood Elf. High Elves just don’t have the gift for music that their woodland cousins do. Most likely, though, it was Tyle’s desire to remember his deceased wife that drove him to make sure Mayt became a Cleric. At any rate, Tyle was convinced Mayt was going to be a great Cleric, and Mayt was quite happy to oblige him. He thought being a Cleric, having the power to heal and protect, would be fantastic. The adventure aspect of being a Cleric also attracted him, and he often daydreamed about defending Kelethin. In his mind’s eye he was there, fighting beside his father and mother, and when his mother fell against the Orcs, Mayt would cast a healing spell of great power and his mother would be restored and live. And when another Orc slashed his father’s throat, he would again cast a powerful healing spell, and save his father’s voice. At the end of the day, his family would march away from the field of battle, alive and well, and everyone who they saw would greet him and say ‘You must be a great Cleric, Mayt, to have kept both your parents alive’.<br>
<br>
Tyle stood up and took Mayt’s hand. He looked down at his son and smiled. “Are you ready, great Cleric?”<br>
<br>
Mayt didn’t look up at his father; his eyes were fixed on the door to the guildhall. “Yes, I am,” he said, nodding his head vigorously.<br>
<br>
Together they walked to the door of the guildhall, hand in hand. Tyle allowed Mayt to open the door, and he did. Before him lay the rest of his life.<br>
<br>
He was going to be a great Cleric!<br>

<br>
Three weeks passed without a sign from the mysterious Erudite Paladin Emeroun, and it looked to Mayt like the issue was closed. Most likely, he thought, he was mortally embarrassed at being bested by a wizard and virtually naked paladin and losing his sword, and had returned to Erudin. In Mayt’s experience most Paladins had strange notions about honor and justice, so he was able to believe just about anything about the motivations of this odd Erudite Paladin.<br>
<br>
Maella was by his side, her hand in his, as they walked through the front gates of Felwithe into the Greater Faydark woods. Maella had been asking Mayt for over a week to take her back to see the Fay Drakes in the Lesser Faydark, and he had finally relented. At first he was concerned that Emeroun might show his face again, but that concern had evaporated a few days ago. Even Vaal, who was often paranoid about these things, had decided it was safe for him and Lileah to move out of the Venom and back to their small home. And so, that morning, when Maella once again asked if he could take her to the Fay Drakes, he had glanced at Ianarae for her approval. She had smiled and nodded, silently agreeing with Mayt that any danger was long gone.<br>
<br>
As they approached the massive stone teeth that served as a focus for Wizards when they teleported around Norrath, Maella was tugging excitedly at his hand, urging him to go faster.<br>
<br>
“Maella,” he smiled. “You must learn to be more patient dear.”<br>
<br>
She giggled and twisted around, bouncing in front of him happily. “I’m gonna see the Fay Drakes again,” she said in a sing-song voice.<br>
<br>
Mayt smiled at his daughter and bent to speak with her, hoping to calm her just a bit so he could get her to the Drakes with less trouble. He didn’t want her running off in excitement.<br>
<br>
“Maella, sweetheart,” he said calmly, “daddy needs you to –“<br>
<br>
“I’ll send you to your god, worthless scum!” a rough voice growled from Mayt’s right. He snapped his head toward the sound and was instantly filled with dread when he saw Emeroun bolting from behind one of the Wizard spires, charging toward him and Maella, a sword drawn in his hand. His face was twisted in a snarl of anger and hatred, a look Mayt had never seen on the Erudite before. <br>
<br>
Mayt instantly released Maella’s hand and cast a rooting spell on the charging Erudite. The spell went off just before Emeroun reached Mayt, holding the large man firmly to the ground. Emeroun snarled and spat as he tried desperately to break free from the magical bonds holding him to the ground.<br>
<br>
“Stupid High Elf fool!” He raged. “In god’s name get out of the way!” His eyes were drawn to small slits and they focused past Mayt.<br>
<br>
Mayt’s stomach flopped and fear gripped at his chest as he realized someone was behind him. Emeroun wasn’t trying to attack him - he was after someone else! He whirled around, preparing to cast another spell of rooting but came face to face with the leering soulless eyes of a skeleton. With a hideous cackle the skeleton swung a bony fist at the Wizard, catching him squarely on the side of his head before he could complete his spell. He fell to the ground, stunned, his vision filled with floating sparks of light. As he heard his daughter scream in fear, he felt another blow land on his head, and the world winked out in darkness.<br>

<br>
Mayt sat quietly in the large chair, staring intently at his soft leather shoes. He wasn’t looking forward to this meeting. For the last five years he’d been working as hard as possible to be the best Cleric he could be, and now, he was going to be a failure. At twelve years old he should be starting to master the basic magic spells, but no matter how hard he tried he was completely unable to call forth magic. He thought of his father, and how disappointed he would be when he found out his son wasn’t going to be a Cleric. All Mayt could remember of his life was his desire, no, his destiny, to be a Cleric in the service of Tunare and Felwithe. He desperately fought back the tears threatening to fill his eyes.<br>
<br>
The door opened softly and Master Yeolorn entered followed closely by Tyle. Mayt couldn’t make himself look at his father, afraid to see his face, to feel his shame.<br>
<br>
“It is good of you to come to see us, Tyle. I know your inn keeps you busy,” Yeolorn said as he walked toward his desk. He indicated the chair beside Mayt with his hand. “Please sit and make yourself comfortable, my friend.”<br>
<br>
Tyle sat down casually. “I can always make time for Tunare’s Clerics, Master Yeolorn,” he said, his voice a loud whisper. He smiled and ran his hands along the armrests of the chair. “I trust everything is alright?” He looked over at Mayt. When his son didn’t look back at him, he frowned. “Or maybe there is something wrong?” He looked at Yeolorn and his frown deepened. “Has Mayt done something that requires correction? If so, I can assure you I will support any methods you need to use to correct his behavior.”<br>
<br>
Master Yeolorn returned the frown and sighed deeply as he sat down heavily. “I am afraid we have a difficult situation, Tyle.”<br>
<br>
Tyle looked at Mayt and then back to Yeolorn, his face darkening with anger. “What has my son done?” Tyle’s words sounded bitter in his sibilant voice. “If he has been disrespectful in any way, I’ll make sure - ”<br>
<br>
Master Yeolorn interrupted Tyle by holding up his hand and shook his head. “Tyle, your son has been nothing but an exemplary student. He has worked harder than any other in training. He has never misspoken, he has always been respectful, always articulate, and in all ways a model student.” He laid his hands on the desk, palms down. “I want to make this perfectly clear, Tyle: Mayt had done nothing wrong.”<br>
<br>
Mayt sighed internally. At least Master Yeolorn’s kind words of praise would lessen his father’s embarrassment.<br>
<br>
Tyle glanced between Yeolorn and Mayt, confusion spreading across his face. “But then…” he began, his voice strained. “I’m afraid I don’t understand, Master Yeorlorn. If he has been a model student, then what is the problem?”<br>
<br>
“Mayt is at the age where his magical powers should be manifesting themselves. As he grows into adulthood, his powers will grow, and it was our intention to direct their growth in such a way that he can serve The Mother of All.” Yeolorn looked at Mayt and frowned. “Unfortunately, even though Mayt has, as I said earlier, been a model student, and in all ways strived to learn what we teach, he does not seem able to grasp even the simplest of healing spells.”<br>
<br>
A look of shock flashed across Tyle’s face. “Then my son has no magic in him? How is that possible? His mother - his grandmother - they were both great Healers. Even I have the ability to weave magic into my songs. Magic absolutely proliferates through this family from generation to generation.” His hoarse voice was raspy with emotion. “My son cannot be magically inert! It is not possible!”<br>
<br>
Mayt bit his lip hard, fighting to stem the flow of tears.<br>
<br>
“No, Tyle, you are correct,” Yeorlorn replied. “Magic does indeed flow through your family, including Mayt. There is no doubt that he has come of age and his body is awakening in power. In fact, we have detected power in Mayt that is much stronger than we would expect to see in any Elf his age. Make no doubt about it: Mayt has the power of magic running through his blood.”<br>
<br>
Tyle narrowed his eyes in confusion. “Well, then, what is the problem? If Mayt has the power, and he is a good student -” He stopped, obviously unable to find the words.<br>
<br>
Yeorlorn sighed. “It is a most unusual thing, Tyle. Mayt has power, and he works at his spells harder than any student. I am sure it must be exceedingly frustrating for him, and yet he continues, day after day, struggling to bring forth the energy that courses through him.” He ran a hand across his brow and breathed deeply. “For some reason, one we cannot determine, he is completely unable to cast even the simplest spells, even though he performs the actions necessary with complete accuracy.” Yeorlorn clasped his hands together and leaned forward on his desk. “For all we know and understand, Mayt should be releasing his energy and the spells he tries to cast should be successful. But, no matter what he does, the spells never manifest themselves as they should. In fact, nothing whatsoever happens. If we didn’t know better, I would assume Mayt was without magic.”  <br>
<br>
Yeolorn paused and watched Tyle for a reaction. The old Bard stared dumbfounded at the Cleric, shaking his head slowly.<br>
<br>
“Then what is to be done?” Tyle asked after a few moments of uncomfortable silence.<br>
<br>
Yeolorn looked up at the ceiling and sighed deeply. He slowly brought his head down to look at Tyle again. “At this time, Tyle, all we can suggest is that Mayt return home with you.” He shrugged slightly. “The hard truth is, Mayt is taking the place of other young Clerics who need our time and training. Even though I would dearly like to have Mayt join the ranks of Tunare’s Healers, I see no possible way for this to happen.” He paused to observe Tyle’s reaction. “This has been a concern for over a year now, I fear. Please know, Tyle, this decision has not been made lightly.”<br>
<br>
Tyle nodded wordlessly, his eyes on the floor. He was silent for long moments and then finally spoke. “When?” he asked simply.<br>
<br>
Yeolorn looked at Mayt with obvious sadness. “Today. There is no need to keep him here any longer.”<br>
<br>
Tyle immediately rose and reached for Mayt’s hand. “Come Mayt. You can learn to wash dishes with me,” he said, his throaty voice thick with bitterness.<br>
<br>
Mayt stood and followed his father as he walked to the door leading from the room. His face was wet with tears. Inside him, shame burned hotly, and he wished he could just disappear from the world. As Tyle placed his hand on the doorknob Yeolorn stood.<br>
<br>
“Tyle,” he said quietly.<br>
<br>
Tyle turned from the door to face the Cleric. “Yes?” he said caustically.<br>
<br>
“Tyle, remember, this is not Mayt’s fault,” Yeolorn said softly. “He has done everything he could possibly do. There is no shame in this for him, or for your family.”<br>
<br>
Tyle snarled. “I’ll be the judge of what shames my family. Not you.” He glared at Yeolorn with dark eyes. “Is that all?”<br>
<br>
Yeolorn closed his eyes and nodded. “Yes,” he said. “Goodbye Mayt. I wish you well.”<br>
<br>
Mayt tried to answer his teacher, but the words caught in his throat as Tyle pulled him down the hallway. A moment later the door closed behind him, forever ending his dreams of being a Cleric.<br>

<br>
“Excuse me?” A young Wood Elf was standing in the entrance of the Venom, looking around the inn nervously.<br>
<br>
“Come in and have a seat,” Ianarae said as she was bent over wiping one of the empty tables. “I’ll be with you in a moment friend.”<br>
<br>
“Is there an Ianarae here?” he asked timidly.<br>
<br>
Ianarae stopped wiping the table and stood, smiling. “Yes there is. I’m her.” She dropped her washcloth on the tray resting on a nearby table and walked over to meet him. “What can I do for you?” she asked.<br>
<br>
“I was out walking in the Faydark,” he began falteringly, “well, I was just looking for some berries to use for making some wine, and well-“<br>
<br>
“Is something wrong?” Ianarae asked. She really didn’t have to ask the question because she was sure something was wrong. Just by the way the young Elf was talking she could tell he had some sort of bad news. Her mind started flashing through all the possibilities. Was Tyle alright? He had just left to get some supplies minutes ago. Or Mayt? Or Maella? Her husband had just left a few hours ago to take their daughter for a walk in the Lesser Faydark.<br>
<br>
“Well – uh, yes, I suppose there might be something wrong.” <br>
<br>
He looked dreadfully embarrassed, a condition that did nothing to calm Ianarae. She figured if she was going to get anything meaningful out of him, she had better get him under control. A throbbing fear had started to develop in her stomach, but she fought it down. This Elf wouldn’t be much good to her if he thought she was upset. She took his hand in hers gently.<br>
<br>
“What was your name?” She said with forced cheerfulness.<br>
<br>
“Poular, my lady. My name is Poular.”<br>
<br>
“Well, Poular,” she smiled, “why don’t you come over here and have a seat.” She guided him to a nearby table and he sat down awkwardly. She sat across from him and smiled in a way she hoped was comforting. <br>
<br>
“Now, what do you have to tell me?”<br>
<br>
Poular looked down at the table. “Is your husband Mayt?” he asked. “Mayt, the Wizard?”<br>
<br>
Ianarae fought to remain calm. Mayt had been hurt. She was sure of it, and she was sure it was Emeroun who had hurt him. He’d found him after sneaking around for the last few weeks. She remembered he was a Paladin, according to Vaal and her fear blossomed to anger.<br>
 <br>
“Yes,” she said through tight lips. “Mayt is my husband, and he’s a Wizard. Why do you ask?” She couldn’t decide whether to cry or scream. No, on second thought, she wanted to hit someone. If Emeroun had taken her husband all the way to Erudin then she would find him and make him pay dearly. And if Maella was just left there, without an escort back home… Her thoughts were interrupted by Poular.<br>
<br>
“Well, uhh, I saw Mayt, that is, he … he was attacked today.” Poular said stutteringly. “At the Wizard spires just outside Lesser Fay,” he added.<br>
<br>
Ianarae’s anger solidified. It was Emeroun, with his stupid paladin plan to take Mayt back to Erudin for some stupid  reason and she was going to go there herself and smack him over the head with her staff. She almost smiled at the thought.<br>
<br>
“Was he an Erudite?” she asked, almost pleased with herself to see the look of surprise on the Wood Elf’s face.<br>
<br>
“Yes … yes he was!” Poular said with surprise. “How did you know?”<br>
<br>
Ianarae rolled her eyes. “He was threatening to take Mayt back to Erudin a few weeks ago. We thought he’d left, but obviously we were wrong. And now, when I find him, I’m going to smack him over the head with my staff.” She looked somewhat happy at the thought. Poular shrunk back in his chair, obviously a bit concerned over Ianarae’s reaction.<br>
<br>
“So, it isn’t much to be concerned about?” he asked, taken aback.<br>
<br>
“Oh, it’s something to be concerned about alright.” She narrowed her eyes. “Especially if you’re an Erudite Paladin named Emeroun.” Paladins may be honest and only motivated by good and righteous reasons, but they could be so infuriatingly stubborn often, especially once they had an idea in their head. They were like boiled-down distillations of male stubbornness.<br>
<br>
Poular looked immensely confused. He stared at Ianarae for a long moment as if trying to determine whether she was serious. Or maybe insane.<br>
<br>
“Does that mean you’re not afraid for Mayt or your daughter?” he asked with hesitation.<br>
<br>
Ianarae looked back at the Wood Elf as the color drained from her face. “My daughter?” she said quietly, her voice nearly a whisper. “What about my daughter? I had assumed that…”<br>
<br>
Poular swallowed uncomfortably. “Well, my lady, your daughter was there, and –“<br>
<br>
Ianarae’s whimsical anger shot instantly to boiling fury. She stood up, pressing her hands on the table and shouted: “What? My daughter? That Erudite Paladin fool TOOK MY DAUGHTER!?”<br>
<br>
Poular almost fell backwards in his chair “Yes, my lady. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to mislead you.” He stammered as he stood and backed a few steps away from her.<br>
<br>
Ianarae was furious. It was one thing to involve her husband in some silly Paladin journey, but it was completely another to put a child at risk. When she caught Emeroun she was going to make him pay. Her mind was jumbled with thoughts and images of her daughter taken on some long senseless journey across Norrath.<br>
<br>
At that moment the door of the inn opened and Emeroun walked in, a surly expression on his dark face. Ianarae glared and pointed her finger at him. She felt some relief knowing he was still in Felwithe. That meant Maella was probably nearby, and safe. Relief or not, though, she was still furious.<br>
<br>
“How dare you show your face in this place!” She stomped around the table and toward the Erudite, her hand waving in admonishment. “It is one thing to take my husband on some silly Paladin expedition to Erudin, but it’s an entirely different thing when you take my baby girl.” <br>
<br>
She walked directly up to him and pointed her finger into his chest, almost at the level of her eyes. He looked down at her with a mixture of anger and confusion while she tapped her finger into his chest, emphasizing every word she said.<br>
<br>
“You will immediately go get my daughter, and return her, instantaneously back to me, and I don’t want to hear any stupid Paladin arguments about how you have to do this, or you have to do that.”<br>
<br>
“Uh… my lady?” Poular said weakly from behind her.<br>
<br>
“I don’t mean now, mister Paladin, I mean RIGHT now! You may think you’re tough, but you do NOT want to mess with an angry mother!”<br>
<br>
“Lady Ianarae? I think that maybe, uh…” Poular said with hesitation.<br>
<br>
“What?” she said venomously as she whirled around to face the Wood Elf. “If you’re going to say something, say it! Stop babbling!”<br>
<br>
“Well… that’s not the Erudite who took Mayt.”<br>
<br>
“What?” she said, stunned. “What do you mean? This is Emeroun.”<br>
<br>
“Yes, of course, my lady, I’m sure he is, and all, but, well… he’s not the person who attacked Mayt.”<br>
<br>
Ianarae’s mouth moved silently as she tried to work this new information into her brain. He mind whirled as she tried to grasp the situation. She turned back to Emeroun dazedly. She felt as if the world was crashing around her. If Emeroun wasn’t the Erudite, then who took Mayt? And where? And where was Maella? She forced herself to speak.<br>
<br>
“What happened? If you didn’t take Mayt and Maella, then … then who did?”<br>
<br>
Emeroun frowned. “There is much to discuss Ianarae. I think we should gather your friends. I have a feeling we’re going to need them.”<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
The platter of food fell to the floor with a loud crash.<br>
<br>
“Mayt!” Tyle rasped. “Be careful! I cannot afford to have you dumping good food on the floor!”<br>
<br>
Mayt had been carrying the tray out of the kitchen to one of the customers a moment before the pain hit him. Now he was on his knees with a tray of food spread around him on the floor.<br>
<br>
“Mayt! Get up and clean up that mess! Hurry!” his father croaked in anger.<br>
<br>
Mayt struggled to get to his feet, but he had no strength in his legs, and they didn’t seem to want to lift him up. Liquid fire was raging through his body and he felt like his insides had been thrown into a bucket of boiling water. Every inch of his body was inflamed with burning pain. He gasped for air desperately, but his lungs wouldn’t work either. All he was able to do was emit a weak choking sound.<br>
<br>
“Mayt!” his father repeated firmly. Mayt tried to respond, but even his limbs refused to obey him and he simply stayed there, on his knees, unmoving. He knew his father was angry, but that wasn’t new. In the last two weeks since he left the Cleric’s guild his father had been exceedingly harsh with him. He didn’t blame him, really. After all, Mayt thought, he was a failure. His father wasn’t a bard anymore, but at least he had a reason for his inability; he had lost his voice to an Orc’s foul weapon. Mayt had no such excuse. His father was right; he was a failure. Even so, he didn’t want to give his father any reason to be angry, but he still couldn’t move. He heard his father pulling bowls down from one of the cupboards and he tried to gather his strength.<br>
<br>
Slowly the pain started to subside, leaving his fingers and toes first, and then working its way out of his limbs toward his chest, where it always seemed to center. Although his father was unaware, this wasn’t the first time he’d been struck by the pain. In fact, he had felt the pain every night for the last week. It would come a few hours after he went to sleep, waking him up. Sometimes it was worse than other times, but it had always been at night, and at night he could just lay in bed quietly, crying softly, but disturbing no one. This was different. This he couldn’t hide. He started moving to his feet slowly, using the nearby counter for support.<br>
<br>
“Mayt?” His father’s voice was softer now, a spark of concern in it. Mayt was surprised to hear his father so close to him. “Mayt, are you alright?”<br>
<br>
“Yes father,” Mayt managed. He had to force the words out. He felt his father’s hand on his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Tyle asked. “Did you trip?”<br>
<br>
Mayt just shook his head. “I am alright father. It will pass momentarily.”<br>
<br>
“It will pass? What will pass? Did you hurt yourself?”<br>
<br>
Mayt grimaced as the pain flickered in his chest, nearly spent now. “No, I just had a pain, that is all.”<br>
<br>
Tyle looked at Mayt carefully. “A pain? What kind of a pain?”<br>
<br>
“It is nothing, father. I am sorry I spilled the food.” He ran a hand through his hair.<br>
<br>
“What caused the pain, Mayt?” Tyle asked, his voice tense.<br>
<br>
“Nothing, father. I am alright now.”<br>
<br>
“What do you mean nothing? You can’t just have pains with no reason son. What caused this pain?”<br>
<br>
Mayt shrugged slightly, still not looking at his father. “I do not know what causes them father.”<br>
<br>
Tyle turned his son’s face toward him gently. When Mayt looked at him, he saw pain and fear in the young boy’s light blue eyes. “How long have you had these pains?”<br>
<br>
“I am not sure. Perhaps a couple of weeks. It has only bothered me at nights,” he said and then added: “Well, that is, until this moment.”<br>
<br>
“Perhaps we should take you to see the Clerics Mayt.”<br>
<br>
The young boy turned his head away from his father. “No, father. I am sure it is nothing. I do not want to go back to the Clerics. I do not deserve to go there.”<br>
<br>
A look of pain flashed across Tyle’s face. “Well, please let me know if it happens again, Mayt. I don’t want you to go through pain unnecessarily. If something can be done for you, then it should be done. And the sooner the better.”<br>
<br>
Mayt nodded slowly. “Alright, father I will. I am sure that it is just –“<br>
<br>
Mayt gasped and slammed his eyes shut before finishing the sentence. Fire erupted through his body and he grabbed the counter top to hold himself up, leaning heavily against it. A second wave of pain shot through him, reaching his legs, and he fell to the floor again. He tried to stand up but agony ripped through him again, this wave more powerful than the first two. It felt like long steel daggers were driving through his body, from his chest out to his limbs and into his head. He curled up into a ball and moaned softly.<br>
<br>
“Mayt!” his father cried hoarsely.<br>
<br>
His body convulsed involuntarily as a fourth explosion raced through his entire body. He thought he must be on fire. He exhaled all the air from his lungs as every muscle in his body was stretched tight. His back arched off the floor awkwardly and he screamed. Slowly he felt his mind going dark, inexorably, one bit of his consciousness at a time. The pain shot through him again and again, unceasing, and he blacked out.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
“Mayt?” he heard a soft voice, far away, calling him. “Mayt? Are you awake?” <br>
<br>
The voice seemed familiar, but he couldn’t place it. He tried to open his eyes, but found them stuck fast. He tried to speak but his mouth wouldn’t open.<br>
<br>
“Mayt, it’s ok.” The voice said again. “Everything is ok. You’re in the Cleric’s guild now, and we’re taking care of you. You’re going to be fine.” <br>
<br>
The voice belonged to a woman. One of the Clerics, he thought. He was pretty sure she was a younger member.<br>
<br>
“My name is Filianya, Mayt. Do you remember me?” He voice was calm and soothing. He tried to speak again, concentrating as hard as he could on making his mouth move.<br>
<br>
“Don’t worry about speaking if you don’t want to. You need to conserve your strength so you can get better.”<br>
<br>
He tried to speak again. His lips felt like frozen lead.<br>
<br>
“What happened? Is that what you asked? Oh Mayt, we’re not quite sure. All we know is what your father told us. You have been suffering from pains lately, and they were strong enough today to make you black out. Don’t worry Mayt. You just relax.” He could feel her hand on his forehead. “I’ll be nearby if you need me, but for now, just get some sleep Mayt.” A few seconds later he fell asleep again.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Tyle and Yeolorn were standing a few feet from Mayt’s bed. Tyle was looking at his son lying in the bed, unable to talk, obviously in a great deal of pain. The young Cleric Filianya was sitting on the bed beside Mayt, washing his forehead with a damp cloth. He looked back at Yeolorn with concern.<br>
<br>
“Have you ever heard of anything like this before, Master Yeolorn?”<br>
<br>
Yeolorn shook his head sadly and sighed. “No, Tyle, I have not. In all my years as a healer, I have never seen something as strange as this. Mayt seems to be fine in all ways, but something is causing him a great deal of discomfort.”<br>
<br>
“Pain would be a better description, I think,” said Tyle as he looked over at his son again.<br>
<br>
Yeolorn nodded in agreement. “Yes, pain is indeed a good description. What concerns me the most is that he has been in this state since you brought him here, three days ago. His condition has not changed. In fact, if anything, I would say his pain has increased.” Yeolorn shook his head again. “I fear that if something does not change soon, he will not last much longer.”<br>
<br>
“Is there nothing you can do for him?” Tyle asked<br>
<br>
“No, we have tried all we know. We must wait for Tunare to heal him now.” Yeolorn put his hand on Tyle’s shoulder comfortingly. We will continue to watch over him, Tyle, and if anything changes, we will be sure to let you know as soon as –“<br>
<br>
Filianya cried out in pain and fell to the floor. Both men snapped their heads in the direction of the noise and started toward the young Cleric, who was lying on the floor, unmoving. As Yeolorn reached her side he knelt down and examined her. Tyle could smell burned fabric and noticed that Filianya’s robe was singed in places. <br>
<br>
Yeolorn looked up at Tyle in confusion. “She has been hurt. Quite badly, I am afraid but I can heal her easily enough.” He pressed his hands to her head and shoulder carefully. Tyle could sense magic around him as Yeolorn cast a simple spell of healing. A moment later the young Cleric’s eyes fluttered open and she sat up weakly and looked at Tyle and Yeolorn, a thoroughly confused look on her face.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” she asked in a daze.<br>
<br>
“You were hurt, Filianya. Your robe is burned. I was hoping you could answer that question for us.”<br>
<br>
“Master Yeolorn? Father? Why am I in the infirmary?” a confused voice asked quietly.<br>
<br>
The three of them turned to the voice in surprise. Two feet from them Mayt was sitting up in bed, a confused expression on his face. Tyle thought he saw fear in his son’s eyes but he didn’t look like he was in pain anymore. In fact, he was sitting up in bed, looking as though he had just awoken from a long comfortable sleep.<br>
<br>
“Mayt?” Tyle said cautiously, as if speaking too harshly would cause his son to fall into another apoplexy. “Are you all right, son?”<br>
<br>
Mayt looked around dazedly. “I think so Father. I feel … strange. Odd.”<br>
<br>
Yeolorn put his hand on Tyle’s arm lightly. “Tyle,” he said. “What color are your son’s eyes.<br>
<br>
“Blue,” Tyle said and then looked at his son’s eyes reflexively.<br>
<br>
Mayt looked back at his father, puzzlement showing clearly in his dark red eyes.<br>

<br>
The Power Within 12<br>
<br>
Deepness. <br>
<br>
Darkness.<br>
<br>
The world was spinning, turning.<br>
<br>
Blackness.<br>
<br>
And then, a light. <br>
<br>
Far above. <br>
<br>
He willed his hand up. Reaching toward it. Struggling to break free. The air was thick pitch. He was sinking fast. His hand reached higher, reached toward the light.<br>
<br>
The light. He struggled harder, bending his mind to the task. Pain stabbed through his head, but he concentrated past it. He had to reach the light.<br>
<br>
The light was nearer. The sound of rushing water raced past his ears. Building. Roaring as the light crept closer.<br>
<br>
The rushing built, louder and louder. The light neared. He pulled with all his might, drove his will toward the light. <br>
<br>
Up. <br>
<br>
Out. Must get out!<br>
<br>
His ears filled with a cacophony of roaring voices, shouting.<br>
<br>
The light erupted and consumed him and he was awake.<br>
<br>
He coughed, gasping for air and jerked upward, trying to sit up. His wrists wouldn’t move and they held his body back and he slumped back to the hard stone beneath him. The thick smell of damp stone filled his nostrils and his eyes flickered open, tentatively. The light rammed itself into his head, driving his eyes closed and he groaned and turned his head away. He breathed again and his body was rent with racking coughs. Again he tried to sit up, and again he was unable to. Something was holding his wrists down. He heard the dull clanking of heavy chains.<br>
<br>
He lay there quietly, his body both numb and in pain at the same time. Gradually he slowed his breathing and managed to calm himself. Again he opened his eyes, this time allowing them to form tiny slits, fearing the light. Again pain drove through his head, but this time he willed his eyes to remain open. As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light, he allowed his mind to evaluate his surroundings.<br>
<br>
Somewhere distant he could hear running water, and behind it, sensed more than heard, was the low thrum of magic. Through vision that remained stubbornly fuzzy he looked at the ceiling, and noted its old stonework. He heard a rat squeak echo off the wet stony walls, suggesting the room was fairly large. As he strained to hear he became aware of a soft, barely audible sniffling coming from his right. There was something odd about it – something strangely familiar. He turned his head tenderly to his right and opened his eyes wider, grunting in pain as he did.<br>
<br>
When his eyes could focus he saw a small figure laying on what looked to be a stone altar. The pain built as he strained to open his eyes wider to see the person clearly. It was a little girl, he supposed, and she was crying softly. He blinked his eyes painfully and the room began to spin again. Immediately he snapped them shut, fighting down the nausea that leapt to his throat. Swallowing with difficulty, he licked his lips and tried to speak.<br>
<br>
“Maella?” he said, barely audible. After a few moments with no response, her repeated the question with more force.<br>
<br>
“Maella?” he repeated. Pain shot through his head again, and his stomach lurched. He turned his face up, hoping he would not vomit.<br>
<br>
“Daddy?” the girl sniffled.<br>
<br>
The dizziness overtook him as he tried to respond. He had to tell his daughter he was there. He had to let her know everything was going to be all right, but his tongue was thick and immobile. A rushing sound started in his ears as he tried to speak, building to a crescendo just as the darkness overtook him again.<br>
<br>

<br>
Lileah put an arm around Ianarae in an attempt to comfort her. Ianarae had been alternating between soft crying and morose dazedness ever since Vaal and Lileah had arrived almost an hour ago. Vaal was looking across the small table at Emeroun with his usual sternness, his hands crossed on his chest. Lileah knew her husband well enough to know that Vaal was much more concerned than he looked. Mayt was a dear friend, and Vaal and her were like second parents to Maella. Lileah’s thoughts were running into each other, a jumble of emotions mixed with imagination. And in that imagination she feared terrible things.<br>
<br>
“Well Emeroun, I believe you have some explaining to do so that we’re all brought up to date,” Vaal said quietly. “It appears we have not only misjudged you, but we have also underestimated the danger facing us.”<br>
<br>
Emeroun frowned, bit his lip slightly and turned his dark eyes down at the table for a moment. “I believe I have done Mayt a disservice with my stubbornness,” he said, holding his eyes downward, refusing to look at the others. “I …” he hesitated, his jaw flexing slightly. “I apologize for my arrogance, and my temper. I have much to learn, and I beg your forgiveness. I simply reacted, and that is not fitting for someone of my station.”<br>
<br>
Vaal kept his eyes firmly on the Erudite. “Go on,” he said simply.<br>
<br>
Emeroun looked up, as if Vaal’s silence was an unspoken acceptance of his apology. He glanced at Ianarae, whose head was buried in Lileah’s shoulder. He seemed to be unable to look at her, and moved his eyes rapidly to Vaal’s. Lileah thought he might be seeking some comfort in the other Paladin - some understanding of honour and it’s foibles. Lileah knew that Vaal wouldn’t give any understanding or acceptance until the issue was completely explored, but she felt better knowing Emeroun was feeling guilty. It was a small thing, but at least he knew he was responsible for Mayt’s situation.<br>
<br>
“I was sent here to find Mayt and return him to Erudin so that we could watch over him,” Emeroun said. He paused to wait for a reaction from the others. When there was none, he continued. “My masters believe that certain people might want Mayt for the part he plays in an extremely obscure prophesy that was only recently discovered among the lore of Erudin.”<br>
<br>
Vaal’s eyes narrowed. “A prophecy?” he asked. “What is this prophecy?”.<br>
<br>
Emeroun looked down at his hand and recited formally: “There will be one born unto a Koada'Dal songweaver and within him the blood of Tunare's faithful will mingle with the blood of Tunare's children. Though healing his birthright be, destruction will be in his touch and Death twice shall he bring.” He paused to take in the expressions around him. “Through his powers shall his firstborn be joined with the mother. On this day death will become life forever.”<br>
<br>
Lileah straightened and looked at Vaal, puzzled. “That certainly sounds like Mayt, doesn’t it? The part about ‘born to a Koada’Dal songweaver’ – that sounds like Tyle. I don’t know any other High Elf bards. It’s extremely rare.<br>
<br>
“Yes Lil,” Vaal said as he returned Lileah’s look. “And at first Mayt was supposed to be a Cleric, but we know that didn’t work out. Instead he became a wizard. That accounts for the ‘destruction in his touch’.” He turned his head and looked back at Emeroun. “But the rest of it escapes me, especially the idea that Mayt will bring death twice. Mayt’s brought death a great number of times.”<br>
<br>
Ianarae pulled her head from Lileah’s shoulder and spoke weakly, her eyes darting from Emeroun’s to Vaal’s. “He said that through Mayt’s powers the firstborn will be joined with the mother,” she said, her voice edged with hope. “If Maella is his firstborn, then I’m the mother. Maybe Mayt will send Maella back to me. Maybe he’ll port her here.”<br>
<br>
Vaal and Lileah nodded silently. Lileah didn’t want to give voice to the alternatives she saw in the prophecy.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Ianarae, that might be it.” Vaal said. Lileah could tell he wasn’t convinced of the truth of those words. “What do you make of it Emeroun? You seem to know it well.”<br>
<br>
Emeroun sighed. “I am not sure, Vaal. We believe it might have something to do with Miragul, but we’re not sure.”<br>
<br>
“Miragul!” Lileah said, her voice rising in fear, despite her efforts to put on a good front for Ianarae. She saw Vaal flinch slightly at the mention of the name. Ianarae looked at Lileah, puzzled. Lileah glanced at Emeroun, who didn’t seem to be offering any more information on the subject and then turned to Ianarae.<br>
<br>
“Miragul was one of the greatest arch-mages Norrath have ever known. He wasn’t satisfied with training in just one school of magic, so he learned all four, including Necromancy.” Lileah turned to Emeroun. “He was an Erudite, and he didn’t want to die, so as his last act, he took what he knew of the art of Necromancy and turned himself into one of the Undead. Nobody knows for sure, but it’s thought he destroyed his soul in the process.” She frowned and looked at Emeroun. “What does this have to do with Miragul?”<br>
<br>
Emeroun shrugged slightly. “I wish I could tell you, Lileah, but the truth is, we really don’t know. We only suspect Miragul because some of the texts of lore regarding Miragul were stolen from our library at the same time Thulinkar stole the piece of prophecy I just recited to you.”<br>
<br>
“Thulinkar?” Vaal asked. He had not moved his arms from where they were crossed against his chest.<br>
<br>
Emeroun nodded. “Yes. Thulinkar. It’s Thulinkar who has taken Mayt. He’s been studying with the Wizards of Erudin for the last while, and we only recently discovered that he’s actually a Necromancer. He was working with the Wizards so that he could have free access to our library.” Emeroun’s jaw clenched and he worked his hand into a fist slowly. “No known Necromancer would be allowed to set foot on our great library.”<br>
<br>
Ianarae was shaking her head. “This all makes no sense at all. What possible reason could this Thulinkar have to capture Mayt. And Maella!” She held out her hand, palm up, as she spoke. “There’s no reason for it! Mayt knows nothing of Necromancy, and certainly Maella knows nothing of magic in any form,” she said, her voice strained.<br>
<br>
Lileah squeezed Ianarae’s hand in an effort to comfort her and allowed her eyes to join with Vaals for a moment. She saw her own fears reflected in his eyes, and knew she wasn’t the only one thinking of the dreadful possibilities. One thing kept leaping to the forefront of her thoughts: if you wanted to get Mayt to do something he didn’t want to do, the surest way would be to threaten to hurt Maella. Mayt loved his daughter dearly, and he was excessively protective of her. What this Thulinkar wanted from Mayt was a complete mystery to her though.<br>
<br>
Vaal spoke, seeming to sense Lileah’s unspoken question. “Perhaps this Necromancer wants to learn more about Mayt and his disease so that he can use it to inflict more pain and suffering on the world. Maybe he just has Maella there to make sure Mayt cooperates.” He looked at Ianarae and put an arm around her tentatively. “Don’t worry Ianarae, we’ll get Mayt and Maella back safely. Erudin isn’t that big, and we’ll be able to find them soon enough.”<br>
<br>
Emeroun cleared his throat. “I don’t think they’ll be in Erudin, Vaal.”<br>
<br>
“No? I thought you said this Necromancer had been in Erudin for the last while?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, he was. But if he were still in Erudin we would have found him and thrown him out. Most likely he’s returned to his cave, in Paineel,” Emroun said venomously.<br>
<br>
Vaal nodded slowly. “Then I suppose we had best be getting organized as soon as possible.<br>

<br>
“When will they arrive?” Tyle whispered to Yeolorn.<br>
<br>
“Soon. I sent for them this morning.”<br>
<br>
Tyle nodded. After the last strange illness, and the bizarre way Mayt cured himself, his son seemed to return to normal. He went home to the Venom that afternoon and acted as if nothing had happened. Yeolorn suggested that Mayt was suffering from some form of adolescent mana manifestation, but he couldn’t offer any good explanations or even suggestions for the young Elf. Tyle had simply taken Mayt home and hoped the event would never replay itself. However, against his hopes, two weeks later Mayt started to feel the pain again, and within two days of it starting he had to bring his son back to Yeolorn. This time the illness had taken Mayt rapidly, and within two days of the first pains he was completely incoherent and bedridden. This time, the pain seemed to be greater, and Mayt was tossing and turning fitfully in his bed. For the safety of the clerics, Yeolorn didn’t let any younger, less experienced ones go near Mayt. He wanted to avoid a more severe magical out burst.<br>
<br>
That morning, Mayt had not awoken, and seemed to be in far greater pain than the last time, and Yeolorn had suggested to Tyle that they send for a Wizard to come and examine Mayt, since the type of magic manifested by Mayt appeared to be the type controlled and channeled by Wizards. Tyle had agreed easily, hoping for any solution and any ideas from any source. Now he was waiting impatiently for the Wizard to arrive.<br>
<br>
Tyle wrung his hands nervously and looked at his son across the room tossing fitfully in his bed. Every few seconds Mayt’s head would turn from one side to the other, and he would emit a small groan. Occasionally the young Elf’s body would stiffen and spasm, obviously in great pain. Tyle felt Yeolorn’s hand on his shoulder and he put his own on top of the Cleric’s wrinkled hand.<br>
<br>
“Do not worry Tyle,” Yeolorn said soothingly. “Mayt survived the last episode, and I’m sure he’ll survive this one.”<br>
<br>
Tyle wasn’t so sure. As far as he could tell, his son was slipping closer and closer to death with each new spasm. The last time Mayt had released his energy much earlier than this. The last time it had taken months for the illness to build to this point. And it had never been this bad the first time either. No, Tyle was convinced that the Wizard’s were Mayt’s last hope, and that if they couldn’t help him, then nobody could, and soon he’d be burying his son. He shook his head and tried to ignore that horrible possibility.<br>
<br>
Time seemed to creep along for Tyle. As he watched his son toss and turn, he could feel a part of his pain. Yeolorn left and returned, twice, but neither time did he bring someone with him. The old bard paced slowly across the stones, tapping his hand impatiently against his thigh. When the pacing became tedious he looked out the only window in the dreary room, hoping to catch sight of a robed figure, someone from the Wizard’s guild coming to help his son, but the sky had turned overcast, and soon after, the dark gray clouds released a gentle spray. He returned to pacing, once again desperately trying to think of something other than Mayt and his illness.<br>
<br>
A footstep behind him snapped his attention back to the world and he turned around quickly to greet the visitor.<br>
<br>
“Tyle, this Dalmariv, one of the Wizards in Felwithe. He’s here to see your son.” Yeolorn smiled slightly. “Dalmariv, this is Tyle, father of our young patient.”<br>
<br>
Tyle bowed deeply. “I’m most relieved to have you here, Dalmariv. My son is quite ill, and I fear you may be the last hope he has,” Tyle said as he watched the robed figure carefully. Dalmariv merely inclined his head toward Tyle, remaining silent. He was covered from head to toe in a dark blue flowing robe. Intricate patterns interwove amongst themselves across the chest and down the arms of the robe. He couldn’t make out the Wizard’s face from behind the deep hood he was wearing, and this did little to comfort him. Tyle watched Dalmariv as he walked past him mutely and approached Mayt’s bed. He was about to speak, but Yeolorn’s hand on his shoulder kept him silent.<br>
<br>
<br>
As the Wizard reached Mayt’s bed, he slowly removed the deep cowl from his head and laid the hood lightly upon his back. To Tyle’s surprise, his skin was dark, with a darker patch of curly hair upon it. He looked to Yeolorn curiously.<br>
<br>
Yeolorn sensed the unspoken question and whispered a response. “He is here to study with the Koada’Dal, and to share knowledge from his people, and I understand he is an accomplished Wizard. Do not fear Tyle.” He smiled reassuringly at Tyle.<br>
<br>
Tyle looked back to the Erudite who had lightly placed his left hand onto Mayt’s forehead. His right hand remained above the young Elf’s body, hovering there, as if floating on some unseen force emanating from Mayt’s body. He closed his eyes and spoke a few quiet words. At once Mayt’s body jerked violently and Dalmariv was surrounded by gouts of flame so hot Tyle could feel their heat from fifteen feet away. The Erudite staggered but regained his calm with remarkable ease. Tyle noticed immediately that Mayt was breathing easier, and he could tell his son was no longer in pain. Instead of relief, however, he felt a profound sense of puzzlement and looked on at the Erudite with confusion showing clearly in his face. Dalmariv pulled the large cowl back onto his head and walked calmly toward the two Elves.<br>
<br>
When he spoke, his voice was rich yet clear, even though he spoke barely above a whisper. “Master Yeolorn, is there a room where we might speak and not disturb the boy? There is a matter we need to discuss.”<br>
<br>
Tyle turned confused eyes to Yeorlorn who offered him an unreadable look before answering. “Yes, of course, Dalmariv. Please, come this way,” he said as he motioned with his hand.<br>
<br>
Tyle followed the two of them quietly, his mind a confused blur.<br>
<br>
* * *<br>
<br>
Dalmariv had removed his hood again, and quietly sipped tea from an ornate cup. “Your son Tyle, is suffering from a rare condition that in Erudin would have been diagnosed many years ago, and celebrated.”<br>
<br>
Something about the Erudite’s pompous manner grated against Tyle’s senses. There was an arrogant assured manner about the Wizard that suggested he thought he was better than any mere High Elf. Tyle didn’t doubt that Dalmariv would agree with the suggestion if asked. Erudites had a way of turning self-assuredness into arrogance that was unmatched in all of Norrath. His attitude put Tyle in a defensive mood almost immediately.<br>
<br>
“Really?” Tyle said in his uniquely hoarse way. “And what kind of condition is it that nearly kills my son, but would be prized in your lands?”<br>
<br>
Yeolorn placed a hand on Tyle’s wrist, reminding the High Elf that this Erudite had just saved Mayt’s life. The only indication Dalmariv gave that he had detected the resentment in Tyle’s voice was a slight raise of his eyebrow.<br>
<br>
“The kind of condition that shows clearly that a child has been blessed with great magical powers,” he said smoothly. He placed the cup down on the small table in between the three of them and leaned forward. <br>
<br>
“Tyle, your son – Mayt is it?”<br>
<br>
Tyle nodded, his face fixed in a serious frown.<br>
<br>
“Your son, Mayt, is suffering as he is because he has great power within him.” He paused and held up a thin ebon finger. “Great powers of elemental destruction!” he said as if the ability was the greatest any living creature could possess. He looked between the two Elves, sensing their lack of comprehension. “Mayt will one day be a powerful Wizard, and when he learns to control his powers, then –“<br>
<br>
“Wizard?” Tyle interrupted. “My son has studied for years as a Cleric of Tunare! He is not a Wizard! He comes from a long line of Clerics. His mother was a Cleric, and his grandmother was a Cleric.” Tyle looked at Yeolorn, seeking support from the old Cleric. “Once we have this problem solved and he can use his magical abilities properly, he will be a Cleric. Not a Wizard.” Tyle’s voice had risen to a shrill grating tremolo. As he held an accusing finger out at the Erudite it shook slightly. “You cannot come into Felwithe, walk into the sanctity of this great house of healing, and tell ME that my son will be some agent of elemental destruction! It’s not going to happen!”  Tyle had half-risen out of his seat, and Yeolorn was tugging at his arm in an attempt to calm him.<br>
<br>
“Tyle please,” Yeolorn said, half rising himself. “You must remember that Dalmariv has just relieved your son from a great deal of pain. He might have even saved his life. You owe him a chance to speak, Tyle.”<br>
<br>
Tyle looked at the old Elf and fought to calm himself. He turned his head to Dalmariv and felt his anger spark again. The Erudite was completely nonplussed, and sat calmly, utterly unmoved by Tyle’s outburst. He scowled at the Wizard and sat down slowly.<br>
<br>
“Tyle, I mean no disrespect,” Dalmariv began, his voice soothingly calm. “You must understand that I have spent my life in the pursuit of this type of power and it’s control. For me to see someone as young as your son with so much potential is an exciting event.” He licked his lips and looked at Yeolorn before returning his gaze to Tyle and proceeding. “The problem is, Tyle, that Mayt will continually suffer from these attacks until he is trained to focus his energy properly. Children who have been blessed with this kind of power but went untrained have often died from it. I know that may seem harsh, but I speak the truth.” He turned to Yeolorn. “Master Yeolorn: were you involved in Mayt’s training as a Cleric?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I was Dalmariv.”<br>
<br>
“And when you were training him, was he unable to learn your healing arts?”<br>
<br>
Yeolorn shook his head slowly. “No, he was not.”<br>
<br>
“Not even the simplest of your spells? No minor curative alterations? No skin-strengthening abjurations?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Yeolorn replied sadly. “We could teach him nothing.”<br>
<br>
“But surely you did detect the power within him?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, we did. It was most frustrating. He had the power, but not the ability.”<br>
<br>
“That is correct, Master Yeolorn,” Dalmariv said with some satisfaction. “And, should he ever have that ability, it will be extraordinarily weak when compared to the abilities he will – the abilities he could have if he could be trained as a Wizard. But most importantly, if he is not trained properly then he will almost surely be killed by the power within him.”<br>
<br>
Tyle’s head was spinning. If what this arrogant Erudite was saying was true, then Mayt had to become a Wizard if he was to live – that he would never be a Cleric. He stood up abruptly and turned away from the other two men to look out a window. Outside the drizzle had ended and the sun was breaking through the clouds. He folded his arms and sighed heavily. Somewhere, deep inside, he realized that it was only his desire to remember his wife that drove him to make Mayt into a Cleric – an action that was not only extraordinarily difficult for his son, but one that might also kill him. He ran a hand through his hair and down the back of his neck and sighed again. Slowly he turned to face the others.<br>
<br>
“Alright, Dalmariv,” said sadly. “When does Mayt start to learn to be a Wizard?”<br>
<br>
Dalmariv turned his dark eyes up to the old Bard and said quietly, “He already has.”<br>

<br>
The darkness peeled away and Mayt gasped and gulped at the air as the world erupted into existence around him. His first sense was that of overwhelming pain in his head. He went to place his hand on his forehead, but after a few inches, his hand was held fast. Dimly he remembered that he knew this. He grimaced at the pain stabbing through his head brought on by his small movement. He struggled to breath deeply, to remain conscious. <br>
<br>
Slowly his memories rebuilt themselves. Down into his brain filtered the images of him lying on his back, chained down. He breathed deeply through his nose and remembered the thick dampness of his surroundings. He must be underground, he thought; it smelled like old wet stone. He felt a wave of nausea threaten to overwhelm him, and he closed his eyes to shut out the light. He fought down the lump in his throat, willing himself to calm down. He dreaded returning to the darkness of unconsciousness - the emptiness of nothing. Breathe, he told himself. Just breathe!<br>
<br>
He lay there, thinking only of his breathing, for many minutes until the nausea passed. When he felt assured enough, he opened his eyes again. Blurry grayness filled his vision. The room was dark, but not completely so. Now he remembered opening his eyes before. And – there was something else – something important about the room. He grasped futilely at his memories, trying to pluck the pertinent ones from the sea they floated in. Nothing. He couldn’t remember what it was. He opened his eyes again and allowed them to focus. Slowly the gray blobs coalesced into solid shapes, and he could make out a large globe hanging from what appeared to be a stone ceiling, confirming his belief he was in a stony subterranean room. He turned his head to his left and again waited for his eyes to focus. When they did, he saw some sort of large structure, about stomach height, possibly a workbench. It was about 10 feet away, and seemed to be cluttered with many objects. As slowly as possible, to avoid a return of nausea, he moved his head to the right. His eyes focused more quickly this time, and he soon could see the outline of another workbench, but this one was much closer. There was some sort of bulky object on the bench – maybe a sack, or blanket, or –<br>
<br>
His heart raced as fear and panic gripped him. Maella! That’s what he couldn’t remember! Maella was here! She was lying a few feet from him, on a similar structure to what he was lying on. It wasn’t a workbench, it was a table. With chains. A table with chains. He swallowed dryly and closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
“Maella?” he said weakly, his voice a dry whisper. “Maella dear? Are you alright?”<br>
<br>
“Do not trouble yourself, my friend. She is fast asleep. Perhaps it is best to allow her to rest.”<br>
<br>
The voice seemed to bellow in the darkness, echoing off the walls, and Mayt realized how quiet he had been speaking. The sound brought a new wave of pain with it, and he groaned slightly.<br>
<br>
“You were so quiet,” the voice said smoothly. “I didn’t wish to wake you.” <br>
<br>
The kind words didn’t match the ominous dread Mayt was filled with when he spoke.<br>
<br>
“Close your eyes, my good friend and I will light the room. I don’t wish you to be hurt unnecessarily.”<br>
<br>
Mayt closed his eyes tightly and felt the hot sting of bright light from beyond his eyelids. He jerked his head to the side to avoid the white knife of light slamming into his head.<br>
<br>
“Take your time, my friend, we have all the time in the world, you and I.” Again the voice was smooth and calm.<br>
<br>
Mayt kept his eyes shut and thought urgently. Even through his disorientation he knew the situation was poor, but as a Wizard, he had resources. All he had to do was find a way to cast an evacuation spell and he could whisk Maella and himself away to Faydark. Casting the spell would be difficult lying on his back and chained down, but not impossible. The problem was, an evacuation spell took a long time to cast and he was sure his ‘friend’ knew that, and planned to interrupt whatever spell Mayt would cast. Quickly, he developed a plan. When he opened his eyes, he would determine how many people there were in the room with him. If it was just the one owner of the voice, then he would wait until the person was far enough away from him that he couldn’t reach him. Then he would cast a quick rooting spell, something he was sure he could do in the shackles, and root his captor away from him. Once he was rooted, Mayt would cast the evacuation spell without risk of being interrupted. Even if it took him a few tries, he would have the time to complete the spell in safety. He also figured, though, that this person knew him well enough, that he might be expecting him to do such a thing. He would have to bide his time carefully, and wait until the perfect moment arrived. He calmed himself, forcing his mind to slow down, as he always did during combat. He was pretty sure he had the strength to cast the evacuation spell, and the root spell was so simple it barely took any noticeable energy to cast.<br>
<br>
With his plan settled, he slowly parted his eyelids and allowed the light to stream in. His eyes slammed shut instantly, and then fluttered as he blinked away the light. Slowly, a bit at a time, he worked them half open and looked around the room slowly. There was a large glowing ball of light directly above him and he could sense at least two others on either side of him, near the ceiling. The room was indeed built out of stone, and he could see no windows anywhere, again suggesting he was correct, and the room was underground. When he moved his head to the right, toward Maella, he was surprised to see a dark faced man smiling back at him, only a few feet away. He was sitting cross-legged in a chair, his arms folded casually across his knee, and he had a disturbing smile on his face, a face that was directly in line with his own. Mayt swallowed slowly.<br>
<br>
“Well, good morning,” the Erudite said brightly. “How wonderful it is to see you awake. I apologize for the blows to the head I had to administer, but I’m sure you understand it was necessary.” He stood up slowly, his right hand resting on the back of the chair he’d been sitting in.<br>
<br>
Mayt looked past him at Maella lying on the large stone structure across from him. He thought it looked like an altar, and a shiver ran through him.<br>
<br>
The Erudite followed Mayt’s gaze and looked at Maella himself. “Ah, your lovely daughter,” he said. “Don’t worry Mayt, she was unharmed. I would hate to have such a fragile young thing hurt,” he said, his lips forming into a pout. He reached out to touch a strand of Maella’s hair that was lying beside her head on the stone slab. “You have a most beautiful daughter Mayt. You should be very proud.” He looked down at her and smiled, a few of her golden hairs caressing the palm of his hand.<br>
<br>
Mayt’s stomach filled with revulsion and he struggled to remain calm as the Erudite touched Maella’s hair but the desire to strike at his captor with all the energy he possessed burned through him. He barely restrained himself, but through his anger he realized that he needed to reserve his strength for later and reminded himself that his primary responsibility was to get Maella to safety. Revenge could come later. He also knew that chances were he wouldn’t get an offensive spell off before the man interrupted his casting, and then any possibility of surprise would be lost. No, he thought, I must wait my time.<br>
<br>
The Erudite looked up from Maella and tilted his head slightly. “Oh, but you must forgive me,” he said. “I have completely forgotten my manners.”  He removed his hand from Maella’s hair and turned to face his captive. “Mayt, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Thulinkar,” he said and bowed formally. “And I, Mayt, am one of your greatest admirers.” He smiled, as if that was somehow comforting.<br>
<br>
“You have a very strange way of showing it Thulinkar,” Mayt replied hoarsely. “I do not recall having any great admirers before, but I would not have expected them to abduct me and my daughter and chain us down to two stone slabs below the ground in some damp dungeon.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar frowned sadly. “Oh my dear Mayt, I’m only doing this for your own protection. If I allowed you to walk around freely, I would have to subdue you repeatedly, and I don’t wish to hurt you.” He turned and began to walk away from Mayt, past his feet. “In fact, Mayt, I really do treasure you. You’re going to allow me to achieve something I’ve worked very, very hard at for many, many years.”<br>
<br>
Mayt followed him with his eyes until he stopped at another, much smaller, stone altar. Mayt guessed he was over ten feet away from him. This was his chance! He cleared his mind instantly and focused a tiny bit of magical power into a spell of rooting and cast it on Thulinkar. As the magic flowed from his body, he felt something odd, as if the power of the spell was being absorbed before it could manifest itself. At the same time, he realized Thulinkar wasn’t moving, and seemed completely unconcerned. He had expected him to at least try to make it to where he was laying, but instead the Erudite just smiled back at Mayt and appeared to watch. And wait.<br>
<br>
Maella shrieked. <br>
<br>
Mayt’s head whipped around to face his daughter and see her body convulsing as her cry was strangled in her throat. His eyes grew wide in astonishment and then flashed to Thulinkar. There were no telltale strands of green energy twisting around the Erudite as Mayt would have expected to see. Instead, there was nothing.<br>
<br>
“Would you like some tea Mayt?” Thulinkar said calmly.<br>
<br>
“What happened?” Mayt croaked desperately. He returned his eyes to Maella, whose body had stopped convulsing. She was once again asleep, or at least unconscious.<br>
<br>
“No tea then?” he asked. “Very well. Perhaps later.”<br>
<br>
“What happened? What have you done to me? What have you done to my daughter?” Mayt asked, his weak voice thick with fear.<br>
<br>
“Well, you certainly can’t expect me to just allow you to cast spells whenever you wish, do you? I went through the trouble of getting you here didn’t I? You have to expect me to want to keep you here for at least a little while, my friend.” He walked over to Mayt carrying a small cup on a small plate. He stopped beside Mayt, raised the small cup to his lips and sipped delicately. As he placed the cup back on its plate, he smiled slightly and said  “Just relax, my friend, and I’ll explain how you’re going to help me with a little experiment.”<br>

<br>
“Have you ever heard of Miragul? Thulinkar asked with a smile.<br>
<br>
“Miragul?” Mayt questioned. His mind was a blur of confusion. Somehow his power had affected Maella – had hurt Maella. He shook his head as if doing so would clear it and allow him to think properly.<br>
<br>
“Yes, my friend. Miragul. Surely you have heard of him?”<br>
<br>
Time! Mayt thought. I must keep him talking long enough for me to figure out what is happening to me. “Yes I have heard of Miragul,” he said weakly. “He was a necromancer of great power.” He paused, to emphasize the point. “He worked around Erudin for a long time, and was instrumental in creating the city of Paineel.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar smiled deeply. “Yes Mayt! Very good! Your grasp of history is excellent. Miragul was indeed a powerful Necromancer, and he had a part in the creation of Paineel. There is much you do not know, though.” He paused and seemed to consider Mayt carefully. “Have you ever been to Paineel Mayt?”<br>
<br>
“No,” Mayt replied. “They would despise me there, and kill me on sight, I am sure.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar’s smile deepened. “There! You see? That is just one reason why I must keep you under careful watch. If I don’t you’ll be off and away from me, and since we are now in the very heart of Paineel, you would be killed quickly if you even set a foot outside the security of these walls.” He swept his hand casually around the room and moved closer to Mayt. “As I said before, my friend, I treasure you, and I wish to keep you safe from harm.” He reached out and touched Mayt’s cheek lightly. “I have such great plans for you…” he said softly, his voice trailing off.<br>
<br>
Mayt flinched at his touch, revulsion mixing with fear and forming a ball in the pit of his stomach. He tried to speak clearly. “Thulinkar,” he began. “I harbor no hatred for anyone, even if they wish to kill me. I am a member of the great guild Evoluxa, and I was, for a time, an officer of that guild. We seek to bring the races together – to find strength in our commonalities. If you need something from me, I am sure we can work out a compromise. I am positive we can fulfill your goal without the need of violence. If you do not trust me, then keep me around until your goals have been met. All you need do is release my daughter, and I will be your willing servant. You have my word.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar looked away from Mayt and sighed deeply. “Oh my friend, I know much of the great Evoluxa, and I’m continually amazed at how effectively Lokus has managed to gather together such a disparate group of individuals. It truly impresses me to no end.” He looked down at Mayt again and touched his forehead with his hand, gently stroking his fingers through the Elf’s hair. Again Mayt found himself growing nauseous at his touch. “Unfortunately, my dear Mayt, what I want, you would never willingly give, regardless of your much-touted Evoluxan ideals.” He paused and looked deeply into Mayt’s eyes. “No,” he whispered, “no, you would not give what I seek.”<br>
<br>
Mayt started to speak again but Thulinkar put a finger to his lips, silencing him. “Perhaps you should hear more of Miragul, my friend.” He turned slowly and placed his hands behind his back as he walked across the room leisurely, speaking calmly as he did. “Miragul was not a Necromancer initially, Mayt. He was a practitioner of the lighter arts and had careers as a Wizard, Enchanter and Magician early in his long and famous life. He was one of those unique individuals who constantly seeks out knowledge.” He paused, twenty paces away, and turned to look back at Mayt. “Soon he had mastered all the common schools of magic, but like any great mind, he yearned for more knowledge. And, as a seeker of knowledge, his greatest enemy was time. He didn’t have enough time to learn all he wished to learn. Over the years he had developed an immense collection of magical items – artifacts of all kinds, some of enormous power. He soon realized time was his most relentless enemy and he would never have the chance to study all he had found.” Thulinkar was staring into the distance across the room. He seemed rapt with his own story, his voice rising and falling with passion as he spoke. “And so, in an effort to steal time and cheat death, he threw his powerful mind to the task of learning the dark arts of Necromancy. He believed that within that school of magic he’d find enough secrets of life and death that he would find a way to eliminate his last great foe: death itself.”<br>
<br>
“I still don’t see what all this had to do with me or Maella Thulinkar,” Mayt said. “Again, I repeat that I would be more than willing to help you with any problems you have. We can come to an arrangement, and you have my word I will help you in any way I can. All you have to do is let my daughter go.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar chuckled quietly. Mayt thought he noise was wholly evil and it sent another shiver along his spine.<br>
<br>
“My friend, you would be well advised to refrain from offering help when you do not know what form that help might take.” He chuckled again and held out his hand, palm toward Mayt. “But please, lend me some more of your patience, and soon you will understand why I cannot ask you for your help and how you will soon be helping me more than you could guess.” He looked down at the floor, as if gathering his thoughts. “As I was saying, Miragul learned the dark secrets of Necromancy. His previous knowledge and profound intellect allowed him to learn in a few short years what it would take an average man a lifetime. Soon he knew more about death than any mortal, and he returned to his sanctuary to utilize this knowledge.” He looked up at Mayt and began walking slowly toward him. “You see, Mayt, Miragul wanted to live forever.” He walked past Mayt toward the stone altar to Mayt’s left and grabbed a large book resting on top of a large pile and held it up. “This tome here contains the information regarding his experiments with life and death. You cannot imagine the difficulty I had in obtaining this great piece of work.” His eyes turned hard and distant. “I have paid more for this book than you will ever know,” he said softly. After an uncomfortable silence he blinked and looked down at Mayt. “But that is of no consequence to you or I for very soon it will not matter any more.”<br>
<br>
Mayt stared back at Thulinkar confusedly. “Ah yes, I know what you’re thinking Mayt. You still don’t see what this has to do with you. Patience. I am coming to it shortly.” He walked to Mayt holding the book in both hands, clutched to his chest. “This book contains the secret to everlasting life Mayt! Just think of it! To live forever! To never die! To be … a god!<br>
<br>
“Thulinkar,” Mayt said softly. “For every action in the universe there is another action – one that works to oppose the first, or to negate it. There cannot be life without death. These things must be in balance.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar nodded, pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows, obviously impressed with Mayt’s comment. “You are absolutely correct Mayt! Your wisdom is greater than I would have expected. Once again, I am most fortunate to have met you, even though the condition of our meeting is not conducive to the formation of a friendship,” he smiled.<br>
<br>
“Besides that,” Mayt continued, “as far as I can recall, Miragul failed in his attempt to live forever. He lives now as a mindless zombie – a creature of undeath.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar nodded again, this time more firmly. “Yes, yes, Mayt. Again you’re correct. Miragul failed. The process destroyed his very soul, and now he walks Norrath as a mere shadow of his former self. His essence, his essential being, was destroyed when he preformed the ritual to grant himself eternal life.” He held up the large book with one hand. “His experiments are detailed here quite well, and thus his mistake is apparent.” He turned around and placed the book back on the stone workbench. “But with his failure the path to success was made clear.” He steepled his index fingers and placed them to his lips. “You see, Miragul found out that a person’s soul has limited power. The Necromancers have long used this fact to manipulate a person’s life as a toy. Miragul figured out how to separate the soul from the body and mastered the skills of creating and manipulating the body. He used those skills to make for himself a new body and then proceeded to transfer his soul into the newly made vessel. His body now lives, and will continue to live forever, but his soul was not transferred and thus he walks the lands as a mindless undead creature.” Thulinkar began pacing slowly away past Mayt. “For many years it was thought that Miragul’s soul had been trapped in a special container and that he had merely made a miscalculation in his experiment, trapping his soul in the container.” He turned back to Mayt, a sly grin on his face. “I have discovered what thousands of other Necromantic scholars have failed to discover. I have solved an ages-old puzzle that no one else has managed to solve.” He turned and pressed a finger into his chest. “I know,” he said, his voice rising, “what really happened.” His face was fixed in a self-satisfied grin. “Miragul’s soul was not trapped in any vessel as so many scholars have thought. It was destroyed in the process. Miragul had not made a mistake in his experiment. He simply did not understand what you have so recently proven you understand. He did not realize that there would be a cost for transferring a soul. He didn’t know of the balance that must exist with the universe. As you so eloquently pointed out, Mayt, you can achieve nothing without something in exchange.” His voice was rising as if he had just won a great victory. “Here is what I know that Miragul did not know: the price to transfer a soul from one vessel to another is the destruction of a soul!” He looked at Mayt triumphantly.<br>
<br>
Mayt spoke calmly. If he could convince Thulinkar that his goals were unobtainable then maybe he could save Maella and himself. “Yes Thulinkar, that is exactly what I said earlier. You cannot get something for nothing. This is why your plan will fail. I can do nothing to help you and if you attempt this procedure you will pay with your soul.” He leaned up, straining against the chains on his wrists. “Please Thulinkar, maybe we can find another solution to your problem. If you have some disease that will claim your life soon perhaps you can be healed. Let me help you.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar shook his head sadly. “So close, and yet so far, Mayt. You still do not fully understand.” He made a small gesture with his left hand. “Here, I want you to meet someone.” <br>
<br>
Mayt followed his gaze to a dark corner of the room. A moment later he could see movement from within the shadows and a figure emerged from the darkness and walked toward the Erudite. As it neared him Mayt realized it was Thulinkar’s twin – a perfect copy of his flesh. The body looked past Mayt with dark soulless eyes, staring at nothing. It wasn’t a typical undead creature; its skin was unblemished and whole and it smelled clean and fresh, lacking the usual rotting flesh smell of the undead. Other than its eyes, Mayt would never suspect it was a dead thing.<br>
<br>
“Mayt, meet Thulinkar,” He said proudly. “This is possibly the greatest achievement of my life – a perfect copy of myself. A copy that will live forever. All it needs is my soul to be truly complete.”<br>
<br>
Mayt turned away from the undead thing a few feet from him and looked to Thulinkar. “Thulinkar, regardless of how long this thing will live, you will never live inside it. You said as much yourself. You cannot transfer your soul to it without destroying it in the process.” Thulinkar just smiled back. Mayt licked his dry lips and continued. “This is madness Thulinkar. Even you admit that performing this experiment will destroy your soul! You cannot win in this. Please, whatever it is you need, I am sure we can get it some other way! Do not destroy yourself this way.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar looked down and sighed, a smile remaining firmly on his face. He shook his head slowly and said, “Mayt, Mayt, Mayt. Still you don’t see. You’re so close to grasping the truth, but you still can’t see it. I never said that transferring my soul to another body would require the destruction of my soul. I said it would require the destruction of a soul! I do not intend to end my life so that I may live forever.”<br>
<br>
Mayt’s mouth hung open and his eyes stared back at Thulinkar widely. He wants to destroy my soul! He thought numbly. As he stared at Thulinkar his mind assembled the day’s information. It flirted with the concept of having his soul destroyed – the possibility of ceasing to exist. No more life. No afterlife. The end of existence. Never to see his loved ones again. Never to be rejoined with Ianarae again. Even after she died! Never to hold her again! Never to see Maella again! Ever. Images of his wife and daughter going through life without him flashed rapidly behind his eyes. Never. The possibility was so overwhelming that his mind nearly shut down with the enormity of it and he could barely reason. Thulinkar was speaking again, but he was only barely conscious of it. His mind was completely absorbed with the possibility of the end of his existence. Again he was aware of Thulinkar speaking and again he didn’t hear him. He wrestled for control of his mind, battling the fierce emotions flooding his consciousness. He tried to focus on Maella, tried to remind himself that he had to think of her safety. Perhaps if he died to save her then his life would not be in vain. Perhaps if he could assure her safety then oblivion would be an adequate exchange.<br>
<br>
Mayt knew a bit about the destruction of souls. He knew, for example, that a person’s soul could not be destroyed easily, and that it always involved consent. As he worked these barely remembered facts in his head, he realized that Thulinkar must have captured Maella as well so that he could use her as leverage against Mayt. Could he destroy his own soul just to save his daughter’s life? Shame filled him as he weighed the choice in his mind: a life for a soul. She would die, but at least her soul would live forever, and one day he’d be rejoined with her. Could he live with that? Could he live with the fact that he didn’t sacrifice himself to save his daughter? He won’t stop at anything to get what he wants, Mayt thought. Killing Maella was one thing, but torture was another altogether. How much could he allow Thulinkar to hurt Maella before he would willingly destroy his own soul? It troubled him when Maella hurt a knee, or fell while running. How much could he take?<br>
<br>
He felt Thulinkar’s hand on his face, disrupting his thoughts.<br>
<br>
“Mayt? I think I’ve lost you.” He was smiling again. “I trust the full weight of your situation has fallen upon you finally?”<br>
<br>
Mayt stared back at Thulinkar resolutely. The best course of action would be for him to look as confident as possible he thought. Maybe then he could convince Thulinkar that his idea would never work. “Thulinkar,” he began, his voice trembling, “no matter what you do to Maella I will never choose to destroy my soul for you.” He paused and calmed himself so he would sound more convincing. “No matter what you do to her,” he said with finality.<br>
<br>
Thulinkar looked back at Mayt with a puzzled look. “No matter what I do to Maella? Whatever do you mean, my friend? I could never harm such a beautiful, innocent child! Why in the world would you think I would?”<br>
<br>
It was Mayt’s turn to look puzzled. “I thought … well, I presumed that you would attempt to torture Maella so that I would willingly destroy my own soul,” he said hesitantly.<br>
<br>
Thulinkar shook his head and laughed darkly. “No, Mayt, I have no intention of getting you to destroy your own soul. I doubt I could do that, no matter what I did to your dear Maella.”<br>
<br>
Mayt furrowed his brow in confusion. “Well then, why do you have her here? From what I know a soul can only be destroyed willingly, and even though I have no understanding of the process, I thought you would teach me and then use Maella as leverage to force me to do so.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar smiled down at Mayt and placed a hand on his forehead, touching it lightly. “Ahh… there is the source of your confusion, my dear friend. A soul can, in fact, be destroyed by another person, but only in the rarest of occasions. In fact, I had never heard of such a thing until very recently.”<br>
<br>
In spite of himself, Mayt found anger flickering inside him. “Well then, if you are going to destroy my soul, then get on with it and let my daughter go.” He strained and lifted himself closer to Thulinkar. “I am getting tired of these games.” The chains clanked against the stone as he struggled closer to Thulinkar. “Go ahead and destroy my soul. And then you better run! You better run as fast as you possibly can, because if you think my death will not be avenged you are a fool of epic proportions!” Mayt snarled behind clenched teeth, “And if you want to have even the tiniest shred of compassion from those who will track you down and kill you like a dog, then you damn well better make sure my daughter remains safe!” His voice had risen to a loud growl.<br>
<br>
Thulinkar blinked in surprise. “My, my! I never would have expected such fire from someone so quiet and calm. Where is your famous understanding? Where is your famous acceptance?”<br>
<br>
“You are beyond understanding and acceptance. Now let us get on with it. I have had enough of you and this room.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar looked mildly irritated. He pressed a hand on Mayt’s chest and forced him down to the slab easily and bent close to his face. “I think you need to remember what position you’re in at this moment, and who is in charge. We can do this easily, and with as little pain as possible, or you can extend this out more than necessary.” <br>
<br>
He waved his hand and his undead clone moved away and sat down in a chair at the foot of the altar Maella was chained to. His eyes flashed at Mayt and a dark scowl spread across his face. All pretense of friendliness in his voice had evaporated.<br>
<br>
“Now, let’s get something completely clear, you stupid piece of Koada’Dal offal! You do not dictate anything here! I am the one in control, not you! I will do as I wish with you and your daughter whenever I wish, and there is nothing you can do to change that.” He extended a hand toward Maella. “I can suck the life out of your precious daughter in an instant,” he sneered. “You have no idea of the kinds and forms of torture I know. Do not press me to demonstrate them on you and your daughter.” He stepped back to Maella, keeping his eyes on Mayt, and grabbed her hair in his left fist, lifting her head slightly from the table. “I have thus far been pleasant. Do I need to demonstrate what happens when I’m unpleasant?” He waited for Mayt to respond, and after a few seconds he spat, “DO I?”.<br>
<br>
Mayt stared impotently at his daughter’s head raised a few inches above the stone altar. “No,” Mayt said weakly. “No you do not. I am sorry. Please leave her alone.”<br>
<br>
Thulinkar thrust Maella’s head down to the stone with a dull thump, eliciting a groan from her. “Do not press me further!” he growled as he stepped toward Mayt again and pointed a finger at him accusingly. “Since you still don’t seem to grasp the full scope of the situation, allow me to explain it fully. First, I do not plan on getting you to destroy your own soul. Only a complete fool would sacrifice eternity to save another’s mortal life. No. As I said before, there are ways for someone to destroy another’s soul, although it is rare.” He poked his finger at Mayt’s chest again. “You’re so ignorant you don’t even know what the prophets have written about you. Let me enlighten you.” He stomped to the workbench and retrieved another, smaller book. He opened it and began to read from it:<br>
<br>
There will be one born unto a Koada'Dal songweaver and within him the blood of Tunare's faithful will mingle with the blood of Tunare's children. <br>
<br>
Though healing his birthright be, destruction will be in his touch and Death twice shall he bring.<br>
<br>
Through his powers shall his firstborn be joined with the mother. On this day death will become life forever.<br>
<br>
He snapped the book closed and irreverently tossed it back onto the workbench. “Guess who that prophecy refers to?” he asked. Mayt just stared back in bewilderment. “Yes, Mayt, it refers to you. You’re the son of a Koada’Dal bard. You’re the offspring of a Koada’Dal and a Feir’Dal. You’re the one who tried to be a Cleric but failed, only to become a Wizard. You’re the one who will send your firstborn to Tunare, and when you do, I’m going to live forever!”<br>
<br>
Mayt’s head was spinning. “But …”<br>
<br>
“Shut up!” Thulinkar growled and pointed his finger at Mayt again. “Here’s the way it works, fool. In order to transfer a soul from one vessel to another, you need the power of another soul. I have no intention of destroying my own soul and that’s where you come in. You’re going to supply me with your daughter’s soul.”<br>
<br>
Mayt started to speak: “I will never …” <br>
<br>
Thulinkar interrupted him with a vicious slap across his face. “I told you to shut up!” he roared. “Don’t start telling me what you will and won’t do.” His hands were shaking with rage as he spoke and Mayt saw for the first time the very real flicker of madness in his eyes. “A soul can be destroyed by two people: the owner of the soul, and someone who dearly loves the owner of the soul.” He narrowed his eyes. “You’ve already seen that when you call forth magic you hurt your precious daughter. Well guess what? When you call forth a great deal of magical energy then you’ll do much more than just hurt your daughter; you’ll rip her soul from her body! And when you do, that soul will be trapped in a soul gem. Your dear Maella is wearing one in a ring on her right hand right now.”<br>
<br>
Mayt felt as if the world was crashing down upon him, pressing down on his chest. He tried to breathe but his lungs wouldn’t accept air. He moaned senselessly as realization struggled to find perch in his tortured mind.<br>
<br>
“Finally you’re starting to understand,” he grinned wickedly. “Yes, Mayt, you will destroy your precious daughter’s soul for me. And yes, Mayt, there is nothing – absolutely nothing you can do to prevent it. Soon the pain inside you will start to build, and soon the power within you will struggle to release itself. As always you’ll be powerless to prevent its release. But this time, it won’t just hurt someone nearby. This time it will rip Maella’s soul from her body and allow me to live forever.” He laughed darkly.<br>
<br>
Mayt felt sick. His entire body was trembling and he closed his eyes. “No…” he muttered softly, “no!”<br>
<br>
“Oh yes, Mayt. Yes!” Thulinkar affirmed.<br>
<br>
The world around Mayt was fading slowly and his head was swimming in an endless sea of darkness. The last thing he could hear was Thulinkar’s black laughter and his repeated cries, “Oh yes, oh yes!”<br>
<br>
<br>
