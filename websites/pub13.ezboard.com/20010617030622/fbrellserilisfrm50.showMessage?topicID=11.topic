I'd say there is one single thing that needs to be addressed on any calender or scheduling revision.<br>
<br>
<br>
If something goes wrong, if a reservation is not abided by, if someone steals your spawn, What should be done about it?<br>
<br>
<br>
I haven't seen an answer to that question that works. Since there is an active sentiment that is pro-FCFS, FFA, XFL, and WWF in many powerful guilds out there how are you going to police when something goes wrong?<br>
<br>
Seeing as there is a lack of an administrative option until then, is it worthwhile to have a reservation system that cannot have authority to police itself? If you do make an penalty, what says they have to take/accept it?<br>

<br>
Yes, the reservation/board system is essentially one of honor, but there is a great deal of power behind the majority of the server and guilds agreeing to abide by these guidelines. <br>
<br>
So, in essence, the moderaters of this board may not have the authority to punish people who don't follow the reservation system (other than probably preventing them from signing up legitimately for anything again), but we as a server and collection of guilds CAN stand up and uphold this system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unillon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nillon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>GD RPers</span><br>  Posts: 2040<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/24/01 2:18:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/soj/itsme.jpg height=153 width=142></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> Great point, that's a fundamental flaw built in to calendars.<br>

Calendars need support of EVERYONE, including and especially people at the top, to work.<br>

The 3 most powerful guilds on the server have serious issues with the calendar, feel it's fundamentally flawed and do not want to see an already flawed calendar expand.<br>
<br>
If 1 of the guild doesn't respect an aspect of the calendar, there is NO recourse, if you remove them from being able to use the calendar they'll just ffa and have their fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unadiabrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadia brell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/24/01 4:16:44 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/_images/nadia.jpg width=99 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> I have yet to see an upper level guild that doesnt care about their reputation.<br>

Reputation is something that only goes so far it seems. People say that the FG system didn't work. The spawns were taken. Ragefire was killed. Problems were encountered. People came out and rose a cry against it.<br>
<br>
In most cases it seems like people were unsatisfied and from what I can tell, people were repeat offenders. This seems to be a pretty clear example that the &quot;reputation&quot; method of police isn't working.<br>

<br>
In my opinion (read - I don't speak for my guild on any matter), reputation is the only thing that we can use here.  And you are right in that one bad apple will ruin the bushel.  This needs to be something that everyone has to work together on, unfortunately.  <br>
<br>
To me Brell has built and incredible community and is very good at working out problems (and dealing with problem children) within these boards.  For every single problem that we have had we have had 100-150 raids that had no problem.  <br>
<br>
As Veranon said there are really enough mobs to go around, just the epics and such have caused a bottleneck (I personally never see myself getting mine do to the new Trak guts spawn and the scales being so hard to get and wanted by a lot of people now).  <br>
<br>
I have fought in many places and have never seen our guild flamed for taking a special spawn (at least since I have been in it) or hogging something, or even stepping on people's toes.  Why is that?  We supported the reservation system (sometimes to a fault) and we had respect for the other people on our server.  If there ever was an issue we were able to work it out amiably with others. <br>
<br>
Does that mean we are less greedy than other guilds? Maybe... Does that mean we have better PR people?  Hell no! You ever read some of Kruunch's posts?  All it means is that by some lucky chance, or choice we have made we have been able to uphold the spirit that has been created on this board and in the reservation system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uconanb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>conanb</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/25/01 10:42:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> id say just do away with all of the reservations.  scheduling a  time to kill a dragon  is kinda like scheduling a businesss meeting or scheduling a plane flight. wheres the adventure in that? wheres the spontenaity?<br>

now of course not having reservations dont mean that you  dont have respect for other people. i would never propose that we all train each other as  we all try to down  trak, or any stupidity like that.  fcfs with decent respect for your fellow game players.<br>

Sow mistrust and dissention among the rabble to wear away at the unified front and concern for reputation that is preventing certain uberguilds from going fully FFA. A poke here, a jab here, confusion over timezones there, &quot;oops&quot; here, enough to make some people rail against the &quot;accidental&quot; repeated toe-stepping but for others to wish to grant the offenders the benefit of the doubt. Get the two groups fighting amongst themselves, and the formerly unified groups of people defending the calendar system can no longer do it. FFA happens, and the conniving guilds who deliberately worked for it have clean hands. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ulver>Ulver</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slackershaman</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/25/01 12:20:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> If FFA happens and if it is decided that it is not where the server wants to be, whats to be done about it?

Or so they say.<br>
<br>
There is no guild on Brell so independent and powerful that it lives in a vacuum, separate from the rest of us.<br>
<br>
The consequences of social exclusion and ostracization, coupled with the promise of those consequences being lifted by getting with the program, are effective tools if we still have the resolve to implement them properly.<br>
<br>
Let's say for the sake of an argument that Silent Redemption decided to screw the reservation system and go FFA. Ulver Stonemace is a member of SR. Ulver Stonemace is friends in the real world with a bunch of the members of Shields of Light and online friends with a lot of people. Those people look at Silent Redemption and say &quot;No love for you&quot; - and actively exclude anyone wearing the guildtag, including Ulver Stonemace. In the real world, Ulver's friends wonder at him why he continues to be part of a guild that seems so interested in tearing apart what we of Brell spent two years putting together. What would Ulver do? What would every other member of Silent Redemption do when faced with similar treatment? <br>
<br>
The power of ostracization is remarkable if you can get enough people with the program. Many religions institutionalized the practice when sect members 'strayed from the flock.' Many, like the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Scientologists, still use the practice. It's been called shunning, excommunication, disfellowshipping, disconnection. And it's remarkably effective when used right.<br>
<br>
Or we can just roll over and take it in the ass.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzestrenocya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zestrenocya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Norrath's Finest Taxi Service [Mod]</span><br>  Posts: 1233<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/25/01 5:29:34 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> Reeblek:<br>

I don't see the logic in saying 'what I do on EQ doesn't count'. If you're playing baseball and are caught throwing spitballs, you can't say &quot;That was just me playing baseball, it doesn't reflect on me in the real world.&quot; Because EQ is a game that requires a computer instead of leather mitts and bats, doesn't make one's lousy actions somehow less relevant.<br>

That's probably true.  However, I don't ninja, KS, train, etc.....However, I still debate the value of linking RL to a game.  Certainly one's in game persona is linked to one's real life persona.  I wouldn't presume to debate that at all.  But just because I have RL friends who play EQ doesn't mean we get together and talk about how uber SR is or how uber their guild is or what we should conspire to get each other in game.  Usually, we talk about something other than EQ.  Naturally, since so many of us play the game, the subject comes up from time to time, but I don't think I've ever gotten together with one of my friends and said, &quot;hey...I know...let's talk about EQ!&quot;<br>
<br>
We spend enough of our free time doing stuff like that.  Its nice to be able to hang out with friends and play the Great Dalmuti or something where EQ's not a part of things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrenstakdagrump.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brenstak Dagrump</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pervert</span><br>  Posts: 1132<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/25/01 11:11:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> Tryllium -<br>

Check out the SR boards and you will see a lighter side of Nillon as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uconanb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>conanb</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/25/01 11:29:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> it is only a matter of time before the reservation system breaks down. <br>
<br>
people will probably abide by this in the short term, but we will have this discussion again in the future i guarantee it. and the answer will be different.<br>
<br>
not that i want to break the system, but it is just facing reality. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleeliadv509.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leeli Adv 509</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/26/01 4:32:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Biggest Concern</span><hr size=1> Seems to me that all players are paying their $10 and have as much right to lead a raid or go to any part of the game as anyone else.  For a powerful group to bully and squish a smaller group is morally and ethically wrong.<br>
<br>
To go to a system such as FCFS/FFA is just a smoke screen to say that the few with more power (the so-called uber guilds) want more access than any other individuals.  In the end, a big guild with many people on at any one time can organize and get to a place faster than a smaller group who needs more time to organize a group.  Therefore, they will always be able to get there first.  Everyone who wants it should have equal access to all of the parts of the game.  To exclude other people because you believe you are better than they are is just plain wrong.<br>
<br>
Someone who is unexperienced at leading a raid should be able to if they want.  If they fail miserably, then people just won't go with them in the future.  If someone who signs up can't get enough support to put together a raid within a reasonable amount of time before it is scheduled to happen, the date should be cleared for someone else.  One of those uber-guilds should have no problem putting together a big enough group for an impromtu raid.<br>
<br>
I realize there are various levels of maturity in the players of this game.  Some people will be blinded by their greed and choose to push for any system that will give them an advantage at the cost of another.  FFA is simply anarchy where the strong can take advantage of the weak.<br>
<br>
I personally have next to no interest in organizing a raid.  It seems tedious and far too much like work than I want to put into a game.  I happily help out raids that my guildies and friends put together and offer any expertise that I can.<br>
<br>
Perhaps instead of clamoring for a system that makes it even more convenient for the powerful guilds to dominate where ever they wish, we should encourage a system that encourages them to help out more individual players and smaller guilds run their own raids.  This is my sentiment for helping out newbies who are putting forth an honest effort, especially those that don't beg...(beggers must be squished!).<br>
<br>
Just my 3 cents in the name of altruism.<br>

<br>
You need EVERYONE influential/powerful to buy into the system.  If you don't have this, it is hosed.  <br>
<br>
Community chastisement hasn't worked on some things in the past, if anything, the person bringing the issue up was flogged.  It's almost like the guild doing the wrong thing didn't hit the right person yet to make the community able to care.  Unfortunately people who would do such a thing under a bought off system don't care about their reputations and aren't thinking long term.  Just what I noticed.  <br>
<br>
So no, you can't do much about punishment.  What you can do is find out the problems, work towards a compromise and it will be gtg with everyone supporting it.<br>

<br>
I agree with both you and Nillon (ack that hurt hee hee) if people do not want to support the system it will fail.  I am hoping we can all act like adults and treat the system fairly.<br>
<br>
I mean come on people... out of all the mobs on the server you have what 8 or 9 reservable?  And they don't even drop the best loot or the most epic drops... FCFS is how we handle all the other mobs on the server.  Why is it so hard to respect the reservations on these few mobs?<br>
