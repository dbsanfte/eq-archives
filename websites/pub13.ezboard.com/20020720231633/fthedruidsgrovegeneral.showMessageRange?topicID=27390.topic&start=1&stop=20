<br>
I'd first just add a general purpose set of dd and aoe for wizards and mages that are a solid 25 %(wiz) and 15 %(mage) more efficient than they currently have and leave druid nukes as they are, this would put wizards way out in front with mages not TOO far behind them. Then I would add a screaming terror type mez and a 1500 point heal with a pretty fast cast time and relatively low mana cost to druids (though not as low as torpor.) And boom, casters are pretty much balanced.<br>
<br>
As far as balancing casters vs melee, I would think that a combo of increasing meditation rates a bit and lowering some mobs resists would handle that.<br>

Mine focusses on the 3 classes who really need to be brought up to par the most. I think these changes would bring them in line with where they ought to be in relation to the other casters(clr, shm, enc,nec).<br>

It doesn't get that mage any more groups. Doesn't get them on raids.  Doesn't get any of those &quot;broken&quot; classes any more invites.

Quite the opposite really, level 19 resses, level 18 succors?  Hardly raiding high-end balancing.<br>

I have never thought that when they said 'caster balancing' that they were only talking about level 60's, nor even 50+ chars.  That is our/your misconception.<br>

<br>
I'd rather see a 2000hp 250mana HoT with an 8sec stun, then 2 more secs of rez like effects on the target.  <br>
<br>
The amount of damage someone could have done is completely lost because of the stun, and that needs to be accounted for with a higher amount healed and a lower mana cost.<br>
<br>
*edit*  Just wanted to add, I think Exedor's idea is very good.  I think I mentioned before about a HoT with an added penalty, to offset it is a great idea to me.  The effects of Torpor are mild in comparison to the effect a spell like this would cause, so I doubt any other Priests would complain. <p>

<br>
The two concepts are largely unrelated and to be honest, the raid issue may never be solved to the satisfaction of most of the high end crowd until EQ2.  Some of the biggest issues in the high end game as far as I can tell are the direct result of very poor long term planning from the start (not the least of which was adding 10 more levels with Kunark).  Many of the more complex issues take far more effort and involve root concepts and strategies of game design.  I foresee many of the more complex high end issues ending up being a main topic of discussion for EQ2 rather then an actual action item in EQ.  A lessons learned sort of thing that would make EQ2 a much better product for all levels.<br>
<br>
I am not really advocating either side, but I have seen what RTFM is talking about quite a bit and agree with his view on it. <p><table border="0">

No real opinion upon the upgrade to your healing but I am wondering about the &quot;screaming terror type mez&quot;.  Why do you feel that Druids should recieve this and where would it fit in with the other Mezes (compared to Chanters, Bards and Necromancers)?<br>

**looks around** It is me or did they suddenly remove the Necromancer class from EQ?  I could have sworn we where a caster class.<br>

I am pretty sure that Mages summoned focus items and the someday soon to be coming mob dropped verisons are VI's way of attempting to balance raid loot pools a bit more.<br>

<br>
I think all caster types should do a better dmg in nukes.  My reasoning is that even wizards lag behind top melee in terms of dmg dealt and caster balance should be addressing that issue--how much do casters overall contribute to the success of a raid and how do we stack up against melee.<br>
<br>
Mages are an odd class.  They get great rains, and some good nukes (about as good as ours).  But what makes them powerful is their pets, and the mage epic pet can do as much dmg on its own as a well geared tank in your guild can.  I am not saying not to up mages dmg ability, but I don't see a pressing need to drop druid nukes to 3rd place since the mages true strength is in the melee its pet does (and that melee can be IMPRESSIVE).  An epic mage with pet up will easily outdamage any wizard...plus mages get at least a few decent clicky nuke items so they continue to have dmg to contribute after their mana is spent (this all assumes you have enough mages that they are not all on mod rod duty).<br>
<br>
I think making all the casters more mana efficient - either by increasing mana pools or reducing nuke mana cost - needs to be the path of caster balance.<br>
<br>
I know different people say different things but overall druids are much more efficient at dealing dmg than at healing, and while we are a priest class, they would need to nearly gut us to suddenly shift that around.  We do need some better heals to put us more in line with other priest classes, but I don't think that should be at the cost of our nuking.  The justification for us being second and third place in several skills, is that we are second place in several.  Letting us fall farther behind on nuking in order to improve but keep us behind on healing will not satisfy me.<br>
<br>
I think the other major issue for caster balance is that the way agro currently works casters have little to do for the first half to two thirds of the fight.  Normally you don't get asked to nuke until the boss mob is at least at half (lower if your guild is cautious).  The risk of landing a big crit nuke and jumping too high up the Hate list and so ruining the whole MA setup can be great.  We need to have a way to be &quot;in the fight&quot; for more of it, rather than standing around waiting for that nuke call.<br>
<br>
I do think all the casters should have spell casting subtlety as a AAXP option--not positive it helps tons but when a druid crit nuke can land for almost 2500dmg (spell casting fury 3 plus mage focus on moonfire, ahve not done the math in detali), I think there is a need.<br>
<br>
Those are my thoughts anyway. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A> at: 5/21/02 5:04:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uronwann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ronwann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/21/02 4:48:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27390.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> This is kind of an old argument.

Mages do sick damage with their pet.  Granted, a pet isn't always welcome, but I don't think you can up their nukes without taking from the pet.<br>

I think a lot of you are ignoring how much more mana regen is available now compared to pre-Velious.  FT items are getting easier to come by, up to FT15 combined.  C3 is in the game.  Focus items are being tested.  AA abilities cause less mana to be used, etc.<br>

<br>
Druids deal damage AND heal. They always have. Ever group with druids who were wannabe wizards and chain-nuking until out of mana and then unable to heal responsibly as they should be? Heh, story of my life grouping with other druids from 20-50. Especially the ones whose eyes would GLAZE over like a Krispy Kreme doughnut when I asked them what they wanted to do -- backup heal or do damage?<br>
<br>
We're aren't clerics, and we aren't wizards either, Ro.  <br>

<br>
<blockquote><i>Minor improvements to the Druid class will NEVER threaten your worth as a Cleric.</i></blockquote><br>
<br>
Also, we never asked for a heal greater than Divine Light without the understanding that Divine Light would also get the same boost. Healing needs an increase across the board although Torpor is fine as it is. <br>

<br>
One of the key imbalances between offensive caster and melee is that melee characters can sustain far higher damage over time due to mana regeneration limitations.<br>
<br>
To fix this problem, either (a) mana regeneration should be increased for all players or (b) druids and wizards should receive an innate ability or "discipline" which has the effect of casting a mana-free direct damage spell, much like the various click-DD items available in game.  In the case of (b), the ability should be calibrated such that one using it alone can achieve a maximum of about 50-75% of the damage of a melee player against a non-resistant target.<br>
<br>
These changes should apply to all players of all levels, but with a particular emphasis on the 50+ crowd where the huge imbalances become manifest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/22/02 5:52:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27390.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <i>b) druids and wizards should receive an innate ability or "discipline" which has the effect of casting a mana-free direct damage spell, much like the various click-DD items available in game.</i><br>

That is a darn good idea since we don't get many DD clickies -- the newest clicky DD drops in Vex Thal, so the majority of us have a fat chance of getting one. <br>

Post 50, people fight over themselves to get wizards in thier groups.  In raids, the wizard groups are also known as the exp group.<br>
<br>
It only takes one lvl 60 critical to kill blue MoBs.  Our highest guild wizard's nukes are unbelievable.  He crits all the freaking time.  I can cast blizzard, and nuke non-stop with a focus bracer and he can stand up and drop a single bomb and get the exp.<br>

Hats off to wizards.  I believe thier power is exactely where it should be.  They truely are the masters of magical dmg and can do some awe-inspiring dmg.<br>

It would go a long way in caster balancing if all spells were made available on vendors. Melee automatically get new discs, new damage tables, etc when they level. Casters basically get nothing. Now, some will argue that spells are equal to melee weapons. However, lay it out<br>
<br>
Melee : dropped weapons + discs + dmg tables<br>
Casters: Dropped spells<br>
<br>
It would also be nice if they level'd out the loot drops a bit more btwn caster and melee items in high end zones. The majority of the drops are melee focused with an int/wis all/all item thrown in once in a while. Although, I'm not sure how balancing this would be since equipment upgrades for casters/priests don't even come close to upgrading our performance like melee equipment does.<br>

<br>
Many druids in my guild still lack blizzard, girdle of karana, and frost.  Nature Walker's Behest took me awhile to find as well, and I'm in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
I stopped doing SF cycle after I looted 6 copies of Upheaval in a row.  No kidding.  Don't try and tell me girdle of karana is anywhere near teh same drop rate.<br>

Then I would add a screaming terror type mez and a 1500 point heal with a pretty fast cast time and relatively low mana cost to druids (though not as low as torpor.) And boom, casters are pretty much balanced.&quot;<br>
 <br>
  Magicians... well magicians whine way too much honestly.  Their real problem is pet AI is a pile of crap.  They don't get hold until class AA, heck the hold AA is only really there to compensate for horrible horrible AI.  Magicians don't really need better nukes and such before their MAIN complaint is addressed... half the time they can't even USE their pet.  Oh and 5 minute recast on their epic is crappy too.<br>
 <br>
  Druids have better nukes than magicians (we lack AE and malosini) we have nukes equivalent to the level 60 wizard nukes, but our best heal at 60 is less efficient than a level 34 cleric's.  I think 60 druids have to wake up and realize of the 3 er now 4 I guess priest classes, we are not the healer but the damage dealer.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Lately when we cleared North i was grouped with our best equiped Wizi against Lady Nev. When the fight was at 50% he said, he had done 50k damage now and would sit back to see if it was enough to get XP... . <br>

 <br>
  Ahhh, actually it is unless your common situation is baneable dragons where your melee spend more time running out of AE to avoid frenzy than actually meleeing.  On any longish fight where our 1 or 2 druids aren't stuck pissing mana away on inefficient heals from AE because we only have 6 clerics that day we can stay second on the agro list right behind the MT.<br>
 <br>
  Unless of course the magician has a pet out... in which case he easily outdamages the wizards and druids.  Magicians have a bolt that is a clone of our wildfire but occasionally hits the target twice, then throw an extra 20 to 60dps on from the pet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ujentrikenaspenbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jentriken Aspenbark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/22/02 9:21:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27390.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> hold pet is a joke. mages and necros should get that from lvl 1 instead of aa.<br>

it's a skill they need to have cuz the pet ai is fo friggin crappy.<br>
<br>
other than that, L1n, our nukes are NOT equivalent to lvl 60 wizzy nukes.<br>
<br>
unless you can crit for over 3800 without a bane spell too, like they can.<br>
<br>
elernak's electical rendering is the grandaddy of all nukes, huge in power, and exactly where wizzies should be. about 800 damage per nuke farther than we are :P<br>
<br>
wizzies are balanced perfectly at 60, but they need to be looked at before that unless they wanna solo there. just like we are balanced to 55 but we need some help at the end game. <p>Baron Jentriken Aspenbark

Balancing casters vs. melee doesn't seem like that difficult a task.  Determine a percentage, bump nuke dmg, tone down aggo a bit, and you're done.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are a few areas that this won't work.  Necros need something for raids other than pumping mana.  Maybe a disease-based nuke with a spiffy ratio.  A few of the other classes have stacking issues for raiding that need to be addressed.<br>
<br>
Healing across the board needs to be tweaked.<br>
<br>
<br>
I also have to agree with Fairweather.  Wizzie dmg is limited more by aggro now than potential.  Crits every five or so casts for 3k + damage impress the bejeesus outta me.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=27390.topic&start=21&stop=35>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=27390.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=27390.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27390.topic&index=20><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=27390.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.threadControl?topicID=27390.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27390.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=27390.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral>General - EQ</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
