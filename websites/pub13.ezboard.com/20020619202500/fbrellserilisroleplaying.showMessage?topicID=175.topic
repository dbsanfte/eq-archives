<br>
“We’re almost out of ale dear” a voice called from another room.<br>
<br>
“I’ll make a trip to Freeport tomorrow sweetheart” Raff called, his head popping out from under a bed.  He returned to his task, lying fully on the floor as he strained to reach his broom to the farthest corner of the floor.  “Next time I’ll build a bigger room, or buy a smaller bed” he thought.  “I can’t wait until I’m wealthy enough to afford a cleaning staff.” <br>
<br>
“When you’re there, make sure you get some more flour as well.  We’re almost out of bread, and I need to bake some more.”  This time the voice was in the room.<br>
<br>
Raff rolled out from under the bed and sat up.  “Sure sweetie, ale and flour.  Anything else?”<br>
<br>
“Nothing I can think of right now, but I’m sure I’ll think of something ten minutes after you’re gone, as usual” she giggled.<br>
<br>
Raff smiled and stood up, wiping dust from his robe as he did.  “Well, this room is done finally” he said while gathering up the dust pan and broom.  He turned and smiled at his wife.  Glorias was standing in the doorway of the room, a light smile on her face.  Her long golden hair was in a tight ball, a silver hairpin holding it in place.  As she looked back at him her blue eyes sparkled in the candle light.  Her face was thin and angular, giving her a fragile feminine appearance, like a china doll.   Her hair and face were the only things that belied her High Elf heritage, however.  Her body was human by all standards and showed that Glorias was no stranger to hard work, but her full figure turned more than it’s share of heads.<br>
<br>
Raff smiled as he thought of how many times Glorias has shocked those who, after a glance at her face, felt they could take advantage of her.  Condescension was something his wife hated, and within minutes the offending person, usually a man, would be stumbling over his words to apologize for his lack of manners.  If someone didn’t treat her as an equal, she would soon have that person regretting his or her judgment.<br>
<br>
Glorias moved forward and put her arms around Raff, pulling him close to her.  He held his hands out awkwardly, broom in one hand and dustpan in the other, and kissed the top of her head as she put hers against his shoulder.  She held him for a few minutes before kissing him and breaking the embrace.<br>
<br>
Raff walked past her into the other room and dumped the dustpan into the garbage.  “I’ve been thinking about the nursery, dear.  I think it’s best if we build a smaller room directly onto ours.”  He turned, opened a small closet and placed the dustpan and broom inside it.  “I think that would be a better idea than taking up one of our guest rooms, don’t you”.  He turned to face her.<br>
<br>
“I think that’s a wonderful idea.  But we’ve got at least half a year yet before it has to be done, so we don’t have to rush into it.”<br>
<br>
Raff moved to her and placed his hand on her stomach.  “Well, I’m just thinking ahead.  We want nothing but the best for little Raff” he smiled.<br>
<br>
“Little Raff?” she responded, in mock distress.  “What if little Raff, is little Glorias?”  She poked him gently in his stomach.  “You better not paint this nursery blue just yet Mr.”<br>
<br>
Raff smiled and kissed her again, this time on her lips, while his arms wrapped around her.  “I love you dear”.<br>
<br>
“I lo…”<br>
<br>
A crash from the other room interrupted her words.  Animalistic shouts and growls erupted from the front room, followed by more crashes, and then a scream.<br>
<br>
“Beatrare” Raff shouted as he ran down the short hall to the front room.  Beatrare was the inn’s only guest at the moment, a young dark elf, just beginning a career of adventuring.  Raff turned the corner and ran directly into a burly orc.  He stood stunned for a moment, his breath knocked out of him.  The orc looked at him and laughed, raising its hand to strike a blow.<br>
<br>
“Glorias!  Get …”  Raff never finished the warning.  The orc’s fist slammed into him, cutting a large gash on his head and hurtling him against the wall.  The room spun around him and he fell to the ground.  He tried to breath, but his lungs had stopped working.  He was numbly aware of a pain in his head, and he couldn’t open his eyes.  He heard Beatrare yelp in pain and the dull thud of flesh against flesh.  He raised a hand to his face and tried to wipe his eyes but only managed to get one eye open; the other still refused to open.  He pushed himself up to a kneeling position and yanked his head up.<br>
<br>
Directly in front of him he saw an orc holding a torch to the front counter.  To his left he saw Beatrare, crumpled on the floor in the entrance to the common room, bloody gashes ripped in her nightclothes.  A high-pitched scream from his right chilled him to his soul.  He snapped his head toward it, his eyes growing wide with understanding as his mind slowly worked out the scene before him.  He wasn’t aware he had added his own scream to the cacophony.<br>
<br>
There 10 feet from him a huge orc, one he recognized as a legionnaire from the symbols on the yellow armour it wore, held his wife in a death grip.  With one powerful hand, the orc had Glorias lifted a full two feet off the floor.  She had her hands around his in a desperate attempt to loosen his grip on her throat.  Her legs kicked impotently in the air as she struggled in vain to free herself.<br>
<br>
“NO!!!” Raff screamed as he surged to his feet, running at the orc.  He had barely moved two steps when two orcs grabbed him and forced him to the floor again.  The legionnaire turned to look at him and laughed.  Raff struggled to get to his feet again as the large orc barked a command in the harsh orcish language to the two smaller orcs wrestling with him.  The two laughed and each grabbed one of Raff’s arms, holding him to the ground, facing the legionnaire.  The legionnaire turned to Raff casually, holding Glorias comfortably in his hand as she continued to struggle.<br>
<br>
“Now you watch and you don’t forget” growled the orc in the common tongue.  “Clan deathfist will destroy all you”.<br>
<br>
Raff pulled against his captors with all his strength.  The orc to his left growled and yanked hard on the innkeeper’s arm.  Raff screamed as he felt his shoulder pull from its socket.  Pain flooded into his mind, but somehow he remained focused on the orc in front of him holding all he cared for in his hands.  The large orc laughed at Raff’s futile struggles and raised Glorias high above his head with one hand.<br>
<br>
“Deathfist will crush all humans!” shouted the orc as he tightened his grip on Glorias’ neck.  Raff heard a soft “crack” and his wife instantly stopped struggling, her body becoming limp in the orc’s hand.  The legionnaire dropped her to the ground where she crumpled, lifeless.  Raff closed his eyes and sagged against the two orcs holding him, his struggles ended.  <br>
<br>
“Dat’s for you to remember.  Deathfist shall destroy you all” the legionnaire growled at Raff.  He opened his eye to see the large orc inches from his face, his sharp teeth bared.  In spite of himself, Raff almost gagged as the smell of the orc’s breath hit him.  He closed his eyes again, waiting for the end to come.  It didn’t.  Instead his captors released him and he fell forward on the floor, unable and unwilling to move.<br>
<br>
Vaguely he heard the legionnaire shout another command.  Moments later he heard the shouts of the Freeport Militia and dimly felt the thud of many orcish feet as they ran out of the inn.  The world faded to blackness after that.<br>
<br>
Raff awoke feeling refreshed and comfortable, his pains gone.  “Ahh he thought, it’s over. It was just a dream!  It was just a dream!”  He opened his eyes and looked around.  Through his foggy mind, he realized he wasn’t in his own inn.  He sat upright in his bed and scanned the room.  What was he doing in a strange room?  Where was he?  He threw the covers off himself and bolted out of bed, realization slowly dawning on him.  He ran for the door, flung it open, and shouted for help.<br>
<br>
“Help!  Help!  Somebody, please, anybody!” he shouted.<br>
<br>
He looked outside into the large mezzanine.  He was on an upper level of a large building standing on the balcony of a large mezzanine.  He ran to the ledge and looked over it.  A series of balconies stretched out below him running along the inside of the large chamber.  Below him the ground was so far away he could barely make it out.  “Glorias!” he shouted, his voice echoing from below.<br>
<br>
“It’s ok, Raff .  You’re alright” said a voice behind him. <br>
<br>
He whirled around to see a smiling face.  “Who are you?  Where am I?”<br>
<br>
The voice belonged to a dark haired woman wearing a long brown robe with the eyes of a animal sewn into it.  Her face had a timeless quality about it, as if she had lived much longer than her appearance suggested.  She put out her hands on Raff’s shoulders and smiled at him.  Her voice was smooth and calming.<br>
<br>
“It’s ok. Relax . . . you’re alright.  My name is Sister Serna. You’re in the temple of Marr.  Someone brought you here to be resurrected.”<br>
<br>
“I was dead?” Raff looked at the cleric with astonishment.<br>
<br>
“Yes, Marr has decided that you should live still” she smiled.<br>
<br>
Raff felt relief flooding through him.  “Then my wife, Glorias, you must have resurrected her as well.  Where is she?  I have to see her!”  He turned to walk down the hallway but paused a step later, realizing he didn’t know where he was or where his wife could be.<br>
<br>
“Raff.”  The gentle hand touched his shoulder again.  “Raff, I’m sorry.  We couldn’t save Glorias.”<br>
<br>
“What?  But … you said, … I mean … you resurrected me, why not her?  If it’s money, I’ll pay! I can sell my Inn! You can have my inn…” his voice trailed off, desperation creeping into it.<br>
<br>
Again Serna placed her hands on Raff’s shoulders.  “Raff, Glorias has been called by Marr to be with her.  There’s nothing we can do.  If we could, we would have.  I’m sorry Raff.”<br>
<br>
Raff blinked at Serna, unmoving.  “Then, she’s … gone?” he said, his voice cracking.<br>
<br>
“She’s with Marr now, and you’ve been chosen to carry on, as hard as that may be.  Marr has plans for you, Raff.  You’ve been given a second chance.”<br>
<br>
Raff stood still a moment, his face blank, his mind working through the new reality of his life.  Slowly, anger crept into his features, and his lips pulled back from his teeth.  “Marr can go to hell!” he snarled as he pushed the cleric out of the way and stormed down the hallway to the stairs.<br>
<br>
Serna winced and said a silent prayer as she watched Raff leave.  “You’ve set him on a difficult path, dear Mother” she said quietly.<br>
