Epics are the curse of everquest in my opinion. The biggest cause of greif in every guild that I have been in has been caused by arguments over who's epic mob to kill or camping RF or whatever. I can't stand epics. I hate them with a passion.<br>
Anyway, I really really hope they do not put in upgraded epics. I would rather they put the effort elsewhere.<br>

That qoute, from above, nicely illustrates why epics are lame.  They are such a huge status symbol that everyone and their mother wants to rush out and grab one.  So they can later stand in EC waving a giant flag that says &quot;I made my guild miserable for 8 months, did you?&quot;<br>
<br>
And the solution isn't to make it a weapon you won't bank, by being so uber.  That would require the quest to be much, much harder than it is already and look at all the whining about the quest as it is now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uabashailrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AbashailRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 8:30:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14435.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Upgraded Epics</span><hr size=1> The answer to make it so we won't bank it ever is in the effect.  It needs to be such an extrordinary class-defining proc (A group heal or group heal over time, or significant self-heal), or a unique right-click buff/de-buff/dot whatever that we would never want to bank it.  That is why a Wizard or a Mage would probably never bank their epics now.  Rogues also had such an amazing effect on Ragebringer they have a hard time putting it away.  Even now people are finding the ATK boost on it still makes it better than the best weapons of today.<br>
<br>
Of course the ratio needs a huge upgrade, and the stats could use a little boost.  It should also have a large +bane damage to undead to fit with our class and let us highlight our unique-ness, possibly +bane fire damage also in following with our progression of flaming swords.  But the ratio will always be out-classed in time.  The answer is in the effect.<br>
<br>
With the new possibilities of bane dmg and + %skill modifiers, there are a lot of creative things Verant could do for epics ver. 2.0.  +5% 2h slashing would be nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aeka>Aeka</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1125<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(2/11/02 8:41:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14435.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Upgraded Epics</span><hr size=1> So true.  Going after your epic makes sense for most of the casters but for most of the melee they can go without.  All of the casters get an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  extra</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> effect they never could get before while most melee don't.  For instance, with the Magician epic you get access to an entirely different pet.  Talk about useful!<br>
<br>
Except for Bards, the epic weapons are more or less weapons that help you melee.  There is no real lasting intrinsic value to using Fiery Defender beyond its melee performance which can be eclipsed by other weapons.  Even Rogue Ragebringer and Ranger weapons can be replaced with other weapons(it is hard too but it is possible ^_^).  Except for Bards there is an added bonus that makes getting their weapon: it counts as multiple instruments  That in itself assures it will never get banked.  A Bard may not use it all of the time but it sure beats carrying around a bag full of instruments(*).<br>
<br>
So there I believe is the hint on how to make &quot;epic&quot; weapons better.  Give the weapon some irreplaceable value.  Melee performance is not irreplaceable.  For instance if Fiery Defender had Resurrection instead of the whimpy proc I bet Paladins would carry it around.  Beyond that how about making a new weapon enchance &quot;Paladin&quot; abilities like Bard weapon does?  Maybe make a weapon that negates &quot;healing penalties&quot; while wielding?  Now that would be epic and worth a lot of pain to achieve. ^_^<br>
<br>
I personally would like to see a diety shield and weapon but I doubt Verant will ever have the resources to implement fully.  I guess I can always dream.<br>
<br>
(*) at least that is what I understand about the Singing Short Sword....I'm obviously not a Bard and don't know for sure. ^_^; <p><font size="+1">

For some of us not interested in doing nothing but raiding, these weapons are currently still quite reachable.<br>
<br>
If they want to add even more content that only 5% of the population can participate in then I guess that's fine for that 5%. Their target audience increasingly becomes the uber raider anyway so I guess it makes sense.<br>
<br>
However, Its really going to suck for the non-uber 95% trying to get the current epic when all the fools that destroyed their FD or handed it in to a vendor start over and trample all over us trying to get books. <p><b>

I think the worst part about epic is the fact that when you are in EC (gfay, insert auction zone here) it comes with a sign attached that says "If you are a newbie and too lazy to fight on your own you now have the right to tell me I have a cool sword and then beg for money.  So please beg away!"<br>

However thinking from Verant's perspective...you can count on upgraded epics!!!  Why?  Well for Verant now, it is all about time!!!  How does Verant keep the masses interested and playing longer so that they keep the game popular?  Well: <br>
<br>
#1 they introduce new expansions.  I don't know about you, but I don't think I will be shelling out any more money for another expansion<br>
#2 add AA points so that players can keep playing even at 60th level.<br>
#3  attract interest in the legends server, with promises of unique quests, unique rewards and new uber items, and by othering the opportunity for players to gain notoriety and become legendary heroes of Norrath<br>
#4  add time consuming grand epic quests with the ultimate reward (at least dangle that as a carrot) at the finish.<br>
<br>
Most of the above have worked at various times in EQ's history, verdict is still out on Legends as of yet.  Myself, based on the current epic quest, I doubt I would ever see the upgrade unless I joined the uber guilds on my server.  I can only hope thst if Verant does upgrade the epic, that they abandon the whole Fiery xxxxxxxx thing and think of something new and creative!!!<br>

The main reason people complain about difficulty is because they see some of the quests that have very warped risk vs reward (ex, ragebringer). <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6318"><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/lchisholm/luth_sig.jpg" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=14435.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=14435.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14435.topic&index=33><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=14435.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=14435.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14435.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14435.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Old World<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">New World<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
