Inside our little guild, on various boards, here... talk.  (lots of ugly fights too).  As the conversation has been moving, I've started wondering about FFA/FCFS.  I want to &quot;think out loud&quot; here, and I'd like to hear thoughts without anger... just thinking.<br>
<br>
I'm going to look at what's &quot;wrong&quot; with a reservation system... or at least ours.  I'm a leader of a very SMALL guild.  We're 'planar' sorta.  We're clearly not the ideal template for the typical FCFS proponent.  So, I'm opening a discussion on FCFS without bias.  I can see how/why this system can benefit me... I can also see how it hinders me.  I dont see ourselves shooting for any of the raid lists anytime soon, and I doubt we're going to camp for a planeraid anytime soon...<br>
<br>
The following is a HIGHLY edited post from our guilds internal discussion.  It outlines what I think are the flaws in reservations and why FCFS may not be the horrid beast we think it is... as with too many of my posts, it's really hellaciously long... sorry.<br>
<br>
(cutting in from A-S thread)<br>
Please understand this is just &quot;thinking out loud,&quot; its the end result of the FG vote, and a general discontent with the direction I feel things are going.... so don't think I'm committed to this line of reasoning... yet... I may be soon... right now, I want to hear thoughts/discussion from folks that (1) know me and (2) hopefully have cooler heads than I do (I can get a little too focused on things at times).<br>
<br>
I think the server needs to go Free For All (First Come First Serve). The whole thing. All of it, screw reservations.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
1) The obvious - I'm starting from the FG raids.  I've looked at FG raids for quite a while. FG's were rarely reserved more than three of seven days a week (with three spawns daily that's 18 times a week they were wide open for pickup raids).  <br>
<br>
2) Waste - Consider the Planes (Hate and Fear at least). Besides weekend raids (which take an entire DAY), the average weeknight Plane Raid takes three to six hours and kills maybe 50% of the zone. Spawntime in the planes is every 12-18 hours. This means a full plane spawn occurs roughly three times every two days... yet our reservation system hits it twice every two days... meaning at least a 33% waste of server resources. Factoring in the weekday raids and really we waste 67% (or more with the new floors in Hate) of the server spawn.<br>
<br>
3) Disorganization - The two Antonican Dragons have both remained up for extended times... partially because raiders can't get organized, but partially because reservations have allowed folks with no chance at organizing a raid the opportunity to &quot;hold&quot; the spawn without logging in and being there. <br>
<br>
4) Loot Greed - Reservations have led to some of the fargin screwiest loot rules ever created. In the &quot;old&quot; days, folks kept lists to make sure folks that raided with them frequently got shots at loot... or things went random CAWU... Nowadays it's not uncommon for raids to claim multiple drops. Some of them can get away with this because they have the numbers to do it themselves... and I'm all for that... but some of the Independant pickup raids... and honestly even the small guild raids have begun doing the &quot;if this drops I get it...&quot; People are forced to signup for raids with these people simply because it's a three month wait otherwise.<br>
<br>
5) Origins - When reservations began, Kunark didn't exist. Norrath consisted of the following for post 40 players:<br>
- Sol B (the list rooms)<br>
- Lower Guk (more lists)<br>
- some of Mistmoore (not much)<br>
- Kedge (haven for the organized group)<br>
- planes (where losing several leves was the norm)<br>
- Kithicor by night (play for 45 minutes, sit for 1 hour)<br>
- dragons (kill one, wait a week)<br>
- Fire Giants<br>
- Ice Giants<br>
That was it. Your entire play options consisted of that. Remember, back then planes were deadly... so really you went there to lose levels... I recall folks dropping two or three levels EVERY plane raid. Now, add in Kunark. Levels are stretched to 60. Content added included Timorous Deep, The Hole (later, but..), Karnors, Chardok, Charasis, Sebilis, Trakonons Teeth, Plane of Sky (also not part of Kunark), some outdoor zone I'm forgetting (the north evac), Burning Woods, Veeshans Peaks (yeah, I know), and parts of City of Mist. Granted, the playerbase leveled up too... but frankly the spread increased. Now... add in Velious: ToFS, Kael, Thurgadim, Skyshrine, Velkitors Labyrinth, Western Wastes, Cobalt Scar, Temple of Veeshan, Plane of Growth, Plane of Mischief, Sleepers Tomb (part of Valkitors), etc. There is another plane coming and another expansion coming... the playerbase hasn't expanded THAT much (although it has aged)... where's the bottleneck? It's still right where it's been the whole time... where the easy path (reservations) are.<br>
<br>
6) Loot Deflation - I hate to say it, but Dragon loot ain't all that anymore. Fire Giant loot aint either. Planar aint either either... hell, I've actually got pieces better than my planar pieces... some off stuff WAY easier than planar. I've declined loot roles for every piece of FG loot that's dropped... because it's not really even twinkable stuff. Most of what we reserve is just for &quot;the experience&quot; of a Dragon raid... and honestly... it can't be THAT much of an experience... without reservations, those things will be up still... besides the cloak of flames and one or two pieces... the uberguilds have zero interest in them (and cant' touch the dragons anyhow).<br>
<br>
7) Reputations DONT MATTER - Another benefit of dumping reservations is &quot;community pressure.&quot; Take any of our well established server 'criminals'. After they did their things (ninja looting/scamming/training) they're &quot;blacklisted&quot; from a lot of people. Go into Karnors sometime... the two I'm thinking of are the two people always trying to form groups... because in many ways they're pariahs... earned pariah's, but pariahs. However, with the power of reservations, one can reserve a plane raid... and people will come (A) they have to or they wont get another chance and (B) experienced raid leaders will sign on to help keep it from being a total clusterfack... take away their ability to claim a zone... and suddenly they are completely responsible for their reputations...<br>
<br>
So, I'm sitting here watching the FG's (possibly) drop off the reservation list and I'm thinking... &quot;maybe it aint so bad.&quot;  FFA would mean we'll have to change plans somedays... but we do that now anyhow... &quot;oh, ToFS is crowded... ok... off to Kedge...&quot;<br>
<br>
An open FFA environment will mean it won't take six teams to do a plane raid. There'll be six teams there most of the time. You can pop in, see if anythings up, whack it, and leave. The ubers (not intended as an offensive use of the word) will be able to go up to second floor of Hate (and third floor), something completely impossible in our current raiding system unless they book a day and deny the lower floors and planar gear from upper 40's. Hell, frankly the upper 40's aren't going to do much more than sniff the planes since the change to them anyhow... so... change the rules...<br>
<br>
I've always detested Lower Guk and SolB... I hate the notion of list gaming and &quot;multi-camps.&quot; I don't tolerate it anywhere else... why should I support it in the general game?<br>
<br>
Like I said... I'm not certain I buy into this... but I'm starting to lean there. I honestly can't come up with a really good reason why our reservation system helps anyone... yes, it does let you plan and organize a raid... but that's about it. I think there's too many targets out there for the uberguilds to occupy everything anyhow... and there's more content coming. Maybe our reservation system, a product of the pre-Kunark game, needed to die post-Kunark... maybe we're simply perpetuating a system and a tradition &quot;because we always have.&quot; <br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>

Norrath is so much larger than it was when most of the reserved status encounters were created. I used to be a staunch supporter of reserved status MOB's and in some respects still am.  But the door of opportunity is so much wider now I have changed my mind about many reserved encounters. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udelsonorablackthorne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delsonora Blackthorne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burning Fist of Serilis [Admin]</span><br>  Posts: 1613<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 9:48:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/gabby.gif width=101 height=80></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An Honest Discussion about FCFS... pls no sidebars</span><hr size=1> Just to let you know where I come down on these issues of FCFS. I do not think FCFS is evil or a bad word. It is not the 3rd gate to Hell, or the end of the server.<br>
<br>
I have spent ALOT of time looking at what other servers do. Part of the reason Brell *is* the best run server in EQ is we have the best people, but also we are all for the most part civil and have great leadership in our guild structure. With the exception of a very small few, all of our &quot;Uber&quot; guilds really wanna find a way to work together.<br>
<br>
I really cannot see at this time adding anymore new &quot;reservable&quot; areas to the calendar. In fact, we will probably trim some of them off. If it comes to pass that Venril spawns as often as I have heard that he spawns, and that he is not in fact needed for the Epics, he will _probably_ come off the reservation list (all current reservations will be honored of course but no new ones).<br>
<br>
I think the planes are a great training ground for young characters and give us something to shoot for (reaching that level 46!). Hell, i am still in that portion of my characters evolution, going to the planes for the first time. I agree most of Hate gets wasted, and maybe we can encourage guilds to split up the plane on a voluntary basis. Maybe do some co/hosted guild raids.<br>
<br>
Those are my ideas. In summary<br>
<br>
* We shouldnt add any more *new* reservable areas to the game. Simply puts too much of a strain on the calendar, the mods, and players.<br>
<br>
* Some of our current reservable mobs (read: Venril) need to be evaluated. If they spawn every 72 hours AND they arent needed to spawn the Epic quest guy, it probably should NOT be reservable.<br>
<br>
* Find a way to not waste the planes, find ways to encourage co/hosting of raids (perhaps someone on floor 1, and someone on floor 2) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicophorus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicophorus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://homepages.go.com/~aela_eq/Shield.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Less Talk, More Fight</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 10:00:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An Honest Discussion about FCFS... pls no sidebars</span><hr size=1> Yup, Dels... that's kind of where I'm going...<br>
<br>
One other thing I've noticed... (ok, two)<br>
<br>
A - The world didn't come to an end when the Reservations forum was removed... most of those raids go off fine as is still to this date... in all honesty, I'd venture the number of raids &quot;stepped on&quot; has dropped.<br>
<br>
B - Velious.  Not only does it keep most of our &quot;ubers&quot; busy (and like you I pretty much respect the &quot;uberguild&quot; leaders on our server, we could be a lot worse off... they're good people), but it being FCFS seems to have gone over quite well.  The rants and complaints brought to BSNet haven't been all that major and generally involve the reason why &quot;working it out in game&quot; is a bad idea at times... too much happening with too little informational flow (reason message board sometimes helps).<br>
<br>
Letholas suggested something in his &quot;compromise&quot; thread.  He asked that the FG vote (which is too late to change even though I'm on the 'losing' side of that one) be formatted differently.  I suggest that his format be applied for future votes.  Shoot, we can start some of these soon:<br>
<br>
Format suggested:<br>
<br>
Should (insert reservation target) be left as is, or should reform/elimination be considered<br>
<br>
Yes - Do not Change (insert reservation at all)<br>
No - something has to change on this reservation, or the reservation needs to be dropped.<br>
<br>
If No wins... open a discussion for changes (edit out any &quot;leave it alone&quot;, the vote on that is done).  Then boil it down to the top two/three options and vote it out.<br>
<br>
Edited in thought - our server WORKS because of the people, the guilds, this board, and its moderation (even when I disagree with it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I am fairly certain (now) that Brell could be FCFS, Reservations, or some other system and it would STILL be different than other servers.  I think (mostly) our hotheads our reigned in and that (generally) the cooler heads prevail here.<br>

Guilds will start recruiting vigorously to become &quot;uber&quot; enough to contend with the other guilds. This will bring in guilds with not so desireable people in it and will change the face of how guilds will run. We will end up having a highly competetive server with people stepping on others feet. You think the rants section was bad, just picture something when a raid is gathering at zone and another one jumps ahead of them. <br>
<br>
SR is considered one of our more uber guilds and overall are respected as such. They are a good guild because of their strict recruitment, good leadership, and good members etc. What I see happening is one of these other guilds having a massive amount of people and starting to trample over SR or Enshadowed. Would SR try to compete, they may have to consider being more leanient on their recruitment and therefore following a downward spiral from the &quot;class&quot; that they now have. This is just speculation of course, but don't think that once people start thinking they won't ever have a shot at doing something, that something of this degree won't happen. <br>
<br>
Lets say another Mob such as VS is found where 3 classes need to kill him in order to get an epic weapon of some sort and also class specific armor drops from. People will not be content to wait until SR, Watchers, Abyss, and Enshadowed get what they want from the mob and let the lesser guilds start having their shots. Because they took the initiative early to make an &quot;uber&quot; guild simply doesn't make it right for them to have what they want when they want it. Our reservation system, has made it possible for SR to not really be contested because no one has felt threatened. If/When FCFS or FFA comes into play, the entire face of Brell Serilis guilds will change from having small guilds of friends to larger competing guilds.<br>
<br>
If you say &quot;well, we can just go back to the reservation system&quot; think again. A new guild that has tasted all this power and doesn't have to worry about anyone else on this server will not be so willing to just give it all up because we want a share of &quot;their&quot; loot.<br>
<br>
Another question you have to ask yourself is where does FCFS begin and end.. Will it be when a guild/group is forming at zone to kill Trak, or when Trak is actually engaged? All these issues will come up and people will be flamed for it. It's already happened once where a group was buffing in zone to do a mob and another group came in and killed it, then said &quot;oops, we didn't know that was why you'll were here.&quot; Sure lack of communication happens, but it will be used as an excuse.<br>
<br>
Just some food for thought and all based upon my opinion. I hope something like this does not come to fruition.<br>

First, if people band into larger guilds to compete, that just makes negotiations easier. Fewer parties, fewer free riders, fewer blocks to negotiation, that's basic economic theory. Plus a few large guilds negotiating have more interests in common than a plethora of various sized guilds. I would expect to see conflict decrease. There's plenty of mobs to go around. And a new expansion on the way. <br>
<br>
Second, if they wanna try to &quot;roll over us&quot; as you put it, fine. There's more to killing ubermobs than just having people. It's teamwork and skill. There have been all kinds of examples of that recently on the server. If they have that skill, marvelous, they'll be able to compete and we'll work something out with them as we have with all the other guilds doing velious. If not, /shrug. Anyone who just sucks in players to try to compete through sheer volume is doomed, it takes time and careful selection of people to build a powerful guild. We won't be changing that formula anytime soon is my guess.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uletholasforestheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Letholas Forestheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 12:52:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An Honest Discussion about FCFS... pls no sidebars</span><hr size=1> I think Cyrex's concern expressed here:<br>

Should really be explored more. Perhaps instead of reservations, we setup a system to govern what we as a community feel is acceptable in these areas. I'm not talking crime and punishment here either, but just developing guidelines that those who care about such things will follow.<br>
<br>

It's been proven with Enshadowed that a large uber guild can be put together rather quickly with talented and decent people. All it takes from there is training and organization. You also must admit that there is always the chance that the unforseen will happen and that there will be instances where there will be a breakdown in relations. <br>
<br>
I happen to see more conflict happening with this change, but with more severe consequences. For instance, if 2 large guilds end up controlling much of the server, then any disagreement that happens has the possibility of deviding these 2 guilds and any chance there is to compromise. There may be hurt feelings which will lead to retaliation etc etc..<br>
<br>
Say that 3 guilds control much of the server's uber spawns. SR makes a deal with one guild to share a rotation, but then the third guild finds out and demands the same. Also, you'd have to decide what classifies as an &quot;uber&quot; guild that you would have to extend an olive branch out to. You may piss off a small guild which is talented enough to figure out different techniques and recruits to be a large guild which is capable of more than you'll are. Now, because you've ignored their request to share a spawn rotation, or jumped ahead of them on a raid, they're less likely to want to deal with you'll when it comes down to it.<br>
<br>
I guess i don't really see any solution to the problems which face us. I like the fact that a small guild has the chance to do things that a larger guild does. Should they be penalized just because they can't organize as fast? <br>
<br>
Let's not make this a case where Might Makes Right<br>
<br>
Also, in response to Letholas' post, It should be discussed, but remember that no matter how many rules we made for reservations, it didn't please everyone. There are always ways around the rules and people will take advantage of it. My question was more of a rhetorical question in which to ponder over.<br>

I remember when the servers were coming down in 30minutes for an emergency patch.. so SR members started heading to karnors.. we got there and Enshadowed was there too.  What did we do? I talked to Andadas for about 30 seconds and we ran a joint raid.  I guess alot of people don't see it.<br>

Velious is currently FCFS, I don't see any HUGE guilds forming to stop SR or enshadowed, etc.  Nor do I think you could just guild random people and form a powerful competant guild.

Vumil - I don't think anyone (in this thread) is assuming FCFS of FFA is the devil... just natural human fear of change.  So far, this is a pretty calm thread for a 'hot' issue.<br>
<br>
Thoric - You're right about the basic economic theory thing, but... Cyrex point has some merit... basic economic theory has one major failing... it assumes people will act rational... which isn't always the case.  That said, I do agree that on Brell things have hope... the folks usually pulling triggers here tend to aim first (i.e. they think a bit bigger picture).<br>
<br>
Cyrix - good counterpoint.  Interesting observation that the reservation system helped contribute to the &quot;kinder gentler uberguilds&quot; on Brell.  That said... its kind of a chicken/egg question though... since the reservation system kind of spawned from those &quot;softer uberguilds&quot; I don't know that our risk is that great.  It's not like Ganon, Copeland, Justice, or pretty much anyone associated with uberguilds on Brell past/present regularly sounded as moronic as the fellow from Fires of Heaven... hotheads... yeah, we've got those... but uberl33t k3wld3wds dont seem to fit into Brell for too long.

I'll admit that my &quot;for instances&quot; may be way out thinking but in order to make a proper decision, you have to think of all the possibilities. Dismissing them shows a lack of forethought, and not properly preparing for them shows a lack of organization. <br>
<br>
I still haven't seen anyone answer my question as to why the bigger guilds feel they have a right to not have to wait through a list? I agree it is rediculous to have someone who has not intentionally joined a guild because they can guarantee themselves a stone from VS by signing up as an &quot;indy&quot;. That needs to be stopped and should have before it got out of control. <br>
<br>
Yes, it's FCFS in Velious and in most instances it works. Then again, you have to look at the negatives such as Lodizal whome quite alot of people want the items from and can gather troups up for rather quickly. As in Kunark, once people gain the knowledge and the support to do some of the bigger mobs, there will arise conflicts. I don't wanna see arguments about who was there first, and who's turn on the uber guild rotation it was to kill a mob...<br>
<br>
Most people have common sense and can handle themselves in a proper and mature manner. However, as in real life, people have different reactions, mannerisms, and perspectives. It's this that makes no set of rules work for everyone. People have perceived rights and wrongs and if another doesn't agree with it, then that's when conflicts begin.<br>
<br>
I'm rambling here.. All I ask is that people think through all the options. We have to learn from ours and other people's mistakes. Just as everyone is not happy with reservations, not everyone will be happy with FCFS. I happen to think that our current system helps the majority and not the minority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthoricthemad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thoric the Mad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brell's man of Nomex</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 3:45:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion Notes</span><hr size=1> Cyrex, I think his point is that all the problems you cite already exist within our current system. They just take different forms. People who want to be grief players will do so no matter what system is in place. The whole point of an FCFS system is that we deal with those situations as they come up instead of creating elaborate rules which noone will pay attention to. <br>
<br>
BTW, in terms of creating a big uberguild from scratch, you'll note that the more of them there are, the fewer talented players there are to draw from, so its self limiting. And Enshadowed didnt exactly become uber overnight, they had their problems like every other guild. Most of those problems were due to excessive guilding, frankly. <br>
<br>
Whining about might makes right is the same old entitlement mentality. Our current system prioritizes those who spend less time in the game, are less capable of killing the reserved monster, and are frankly less skilled at the game. That seems pretty ass backward to be honest. <br>
<br>
Those who make EQ more of a priority in their life than you do will always reap bigger rewards in the game. If someone said to you at work &quot;Bob comes in 2 hours a day, but we're paying him the same as you, and giving him the same benefits&quot; You'd think that was pretty silly too. The casual player frankly shouldn't have the same degree of success that a more involved player does. If you keep a system in place which mandates this, without guns to back you up it will fail, because eventually the players will get tired of it. It's a game, there are winners and losers. If i wanna stand in line for 3 hours I'll go to disneyland. <br>
<br>
FCFS isn't evil. There aren't any guilds on this server that are gonna do things like kill vs just to keep other people from getting the loot, as some of the horror stories from other servers say. SR for one may kill trakanon and vs once each in the next 3 months even if they were fcfs. We don't need it anymore. Yeah, disagreements will happen, but they happen under the current system. As you find out when you actually start negotiating with other guilds, we all know where our interests lie, and pissing each other off just hurts our own interests. So there are at most a few warning shots and an agreement is reached. <br>
<br>
Give people a chance to work and don't stifle it with this rules mentality that is a holdover from a broken system.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uletholasforestheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Letholas Forestheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/20/01 3:56:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion Notes</span><hr size=1> &quot;There aren't any guilds on this server that are gonna do things like kill vs just to keep other people from getting the loot, as some of the horror stories from other servers say&quot;<br>

Thoric,<br>
<br>
It's not the guilds today that anyone will worry about necessarily.<br>
<br>
Like the constitution, the raid system with all it's flaws offers a common ground that would not otherwise exist to work out our differences.<br>
<br>
Is this what made Brell unique? Yes, I would opine that it is. Beyond the original's (that definitely also contributed to the uniqueness of Brell)who developed and organized this GOOD thing, it is that it was effective enough for those that followed to not get caught up in the pettiness of the other servers.<br>
<br>
Let me ask this, why are you worried about the reservation system as it stands? What do you gain? What do you lose? If there are so many other ways and places to raid, what difference do these few places make?<br>

I see plenty of pettyness on this server, where have you been?<br>

The number and scope of reservable's in our system is pretty darn small compared to what is available. <br>
<br>
That being the case how does it 'entitle' anything? <br>

You can get planes level armor in Velious and PoG.<br>
<br>
You can get superior or equivalent weapons through quests and in zones in Velious.<br>

Oh, you have.. people didn't agree that some guilds aren't entitled to have more slots on a rotation than any others.. If you have, please explain to me how you see it from their shoes so that I have a broader view.<br>
<br>
Some say we have not compromised in the past with some of your demands (for lack of a better word), but we have.. We approved restrictions on how many raids you could reserve. We compromised between leaving it the way it was, and giving you'll more slots to raid with. Now some are attempting to push the envelope further. <br>
<br>
The original intent of the reservation system is so that those that have limited play time can reserve a time and date that is available to them so that they can experience the fun of raiding and maybe have a chance at winning an item. Now, people are trying to spoil that for them because most likely they're always going to either get beaten to it, or they're going to have to spend all their free time in a zone waiting for something to pop instead of gaining experience or just having fun. Should we punish those people because some abused the system? <br>
<br>
I am beginning to honestly see the benefits of having a FCFS server, but I do question some peoples motives. I'm not attempting to point any fingers or say this is how it will be. I've made my point and I've said my peace. Thank you for discussing this rationally guys.<br>
