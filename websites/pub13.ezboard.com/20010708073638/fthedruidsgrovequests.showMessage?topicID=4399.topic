All brownies you'll be fighting (scouts, tainted, corrupted) are druids, so RM for snare/root and RF for fire dd.  I actually resisted 4 casts of ice from the corrupted which I thought was amusing (damn thing is smart enough to try to debuff me).<br>
<br>
Scouts are a cake, just annoying since they're casters and root/dotting still means you take a little dmg.  Tainted was blue at 60 (guessing lvl 45) and the corrupted is lvl 51.<br>
<br>
I've killed the corrupted twice w/another druid (one was 53, other 59), and both times it was tight because the corrupted hits hard.  If you're planning on meleeing the thing, I suggest fearing just to make life easy.  Also, I had the brownie scouts aggro on me before, so watch out for an annoying green mob add during your fight if the scouts aren't spaced well.  G'luck.<br>

In fact, you can spawn the tainted yourself, with no help (Assuming you can kill the brownie scouts, of course). That's the way I did it. Instead of getting my friends there to camp what would have been mostly green for who knows how long, I just killed brownie scouts solo until the tainted spawned. That way, my friends only had to come and help me kill it. No camping at all, for them. Too bad I can't solo seahorses :p<br>
<br>
I could probably have killed the corrupted also, but I know from experience that it will despawn after a while. The tainted will stay up, however.<br>
<br>
I got it with a group of 6, 52-55, and myself soloing. It was overkill, hehe. The tainted went down WAY fast, and the corrupted didn't last more than 20 seconds.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

Yes, Shaman used pet which didn't get agroed on much, we took most the damage.<br>
<br>
Make sure tainted is rooted and out of agro range when he dies. So the Corrupted won't agro on you when he spawns. Give you a chance to recover. Corrupted will de-spawn after about 10 minutes. So don't wait too long to engage him.<br>
<br>
Have all in wolf form, apparently scouts won't agro on you in wolf form. Pull Taintted/Corruped out of path of scouts to try and avoid adds from the scouts popping. We wern't succesfull with this. We ended up with a scout add. We were not in wolf form however, I didn't know about this until later.<br>
<br>
Good news is while this one takes some camping, it isn't hours and hours. Seems to pop after 2 or 3 hours of killing the 3 scouts that spawn at 0/0. So at least not a huge timewaster for your helpers.<br>

<br>
You can do this camp solo, so that your friends don't have to sit their with you through the boring part. If you are 50+, you should easily be able to solo the brownies scouts, and once the tainted spawns, it will stay up until it is killed. <br>
<br>
If you are doing it this way, DON'T solo the tainted. The corrupted will despawn in a short time. Just kill brownie scouts until the tainted spawns, then call in your friends. Once there, you can do the tainted adn corrupted together.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine@luclin.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>
