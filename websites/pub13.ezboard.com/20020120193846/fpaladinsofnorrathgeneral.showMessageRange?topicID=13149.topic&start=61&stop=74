<br>
Its pipssing me off that it needs a 'bottleneck' to make our quest 'not too easy'.<br>
<br>
Ya know I don't care about investing time, I don't care about working hard, I don't care about putting in real effort to get an epic.<br>
<br>
But what is pissing me off is that its 2 simple books, 2 simple dropps of Dragons and thats it.<br>
<br>
If our Epic would involve 237 steps (Druid Epic e.g.), if I COULD DO something, if it would simply be a long way and not a goddamn 'for most people unreachable simple, rare drop', then I would not complain.<br>
<br>
I would liek to have my Epic. But there is NOTHING I can do to get it. NOTHING!!!<br>
The only thing I could do is organise 290873489 Dragon raids and hope for that goddamn drop!<br>
Both of em.<br>
<br>
Make our Epic 9478534 times longer, I don't care. but make it an Epic one can finish without being an incredible lucky bugger that just gets the drop or without having to kill one dragon 93746345 times until it drops and you are the one able to loot.<br>
<br>
Bards, Druids, Rogues and many others have those 'spawnable' mobs all over their quest. <br>
Is it so much asked to make that 'always drops the book' Naggy and Vox spawnable? <br>
Okay, add 5 other steps in it for it. THats ok.<br>
<br>
DO you get my problem with our Epic?<br>
I am lvl55, I lead a guild, have 92 days played and I attended 30+ Dragon Raids. I haven't ever seen a Book. I haven't even seen it DROP!<br>
I worked my ass off for those dragon raids.<br>
But there is no way in the world you get those books.<br>
You either are goddamn lucky, know a high level guild (or are part of it) that easily kills Gorenaire just for you, repeatedly, or you're screwed.<br>

<br>
And thus we get the real issue with Epic Weapons, and why they were one of the worst things that ever happened to EQ. VI doesn't want every Paladin over level 50 to have a nice flaming portable BBQ sword. That means somewhere someone who puts in the time and effort to get one is going to come up dry, that is why there is a bottleneck.<br>
<br>
They did an experiment with the rogue and monk classes by removing all serious bottlenecks from their epic quests. Look what happened, every 50+ monk/rogue with 12 friends has their epic. It's trivial, it doesn't mean anything, it cheapens the idea of an &quot;epic quest&quot; for every single one of them. Do you really want the Paladin epic to be considered trivial? Didn't think so. Do you want to feel like you acomplished something special, that your time, effort, and dedication were well rewarded? Yea, is what I thought. So in the mean time stop bitching about how hard the Paladin epic is, because it isn't. And stop whining about how awful the book bottleneck is, because it serves a purpose.<br>

I bet most of you all who think they deserve their epic will also think they deserve a 50 damage 43 delay weapon once you ding to 60. Grow up and realize this game isn't here just to give you stuff. Go out and earn it. Any single person with enough drive can get their epic done. If your epic isn't done then it isn't VI's fault and its not the fault of the other players its your own damn fault. Don't complain about how the dragons only rarely drop the book. KILL MORE DRAGONS. Don't complain about how only &quot;Ubah&quot; guilds can kill the Kunark dragons get yourself some damn friends and go kill the damn things. Sooner or later if you do those things you will have your books and you will get your epic.<br>
Do I have my epic? No, cause I don't really give a damn about that sword. Could I get it if I wanted it? Yes, I would either run enough Vox/Nag raids with my twinks till I got both books to drop or I would get my guild or some friends together and go make Dragon paste out of Talendor/Serv/Gore till I got the books. <br>
There are way to many weapons that make the epic look like a Combine Two Hander in comparison for anyone to sit and worry too much about it. <br>
Epics were a mistake on Verants part cause they should have realized that every little pansy ass who plays this game is gonna think it is their right to get them and to get them easily. They should have done it the real epic way and made the sword rediculously awesome and rediculously hard to get and made it an artifact so that only 1 per server would exist. Of course people would whine their asses off about it being Artifact also but I think I could handle that a bit better.<br>

pick up raids can't do kunark dragons, you can't do vox/naggy if your over 52. if you choose to stop leveling at 52 and wait, your screwed, if you choose to level, your screwed.<br>

Aauan you are very wrong, your 10$ a month does not entitle you to an Epic Weapon. What it does entitle you is access to the game, what you do with that is entirely up to you. <br>

I don't wanted it handed to me on a silver plater.  I don't want it to be something I can do in a weekend with 20 of my closest friends (which, btw, in EQ I don't have).  I don't want dinging 50 to suddenly give me my FA or FD.  I want to /earn/ them.  I want to put forth the /effort/ and /time/ required to have the personal satisfaction of owning a Firey Avenger and subsequently a Firey Defender.<br>
<br>
My issue with the current system is, to me, it doesn't feel like I have that reasonable chance.<br>
<br>
For perspective, to kill Lucan: took me about 3 weeks to get enough friends notified and agreeing to be able to take down Lucan.  It then took me 3 weekends to finally get a spawn.  Every time we found he was up, someone else was either killing him moments after spawn, or pulled him while we were organizing.  He appears to be an eight hour spawn, and we normally attempted 4 or 5 spawns a weekend.  I'm not uber, nor is my guild, nor are the people I know.<br>
<br>
Most of my guildmates are either grossly below 52 or over it, and thus any Naggy/Vox raids I join cannot be my own guild.  With the rarity of the drops, and senority/predistination plans on most raids, I will be highly unlikely that I will get drops.  I know less about the Kunark dragons, but I know my guild does not have the strength to attempt them, and I imagine joining other groups' raids would also leave me even smaller than normal chance at these two books.<br>
<br>
Things like the Shaman epic, where the trials are a variety, ranging over assorted levels, and almost all triggered spawns, seem very appealing.  The trial of patience seems like it is really appropriate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
The mage epic, while having numerous difficult spawns, if I remember correctly (been a while since I've read that one) virtually every spawn is triggered or normally up.<br>
Monk epic, as has been mentioned, you can do with 20 of your closest friends in a weekend.<br>
Druid epic - sure, make me run over the known world!<br>
<br>
Make me kill lots of hard things, make me talk to people, make me a currier, make me work, but don't make me wait around for 7day nontriggered spawns that rarely drop the items I need 2 of.  Even if it still takes me the same many months to complete this altered epic as camping Naggy/Vox/Kunark dragons would, I would prefer /doing/ something those months and known I was working toward the goal, rather than just praying the book dropped and I got lucky on the /random (if the recipient isn't predetermined).<br>
<br>
Just my opinion.<br>

<br>
Ok, then what is your counter proposal?  Would it be better if the FD required neither levels nor friends?  I was 60 before I got my first book, and 60 for months before I finished it.<br>
<br>
And sorry to contradict you, but I had people go out of their way into the wee hours to help me get my FD.  People help Shamans and Monks get their Epics because the mobs are spawned, are quick to finish, and always drop what is needed.  In essence they help them because it isn't much of a burden at all.  Clerics and other classes may get help because in addition to the ease of the quest the end result is a tangible benefit to the guild as a whole and even to the individuals assisting.<br>
<br>
The FD is neither guaranteed, easy (in relation to other epic mobs), fast, nor of great importance to the guild or to others.<br>
<br>
So, why did they help me?<br>
<br>
Because of the respect and friendships established between us in the fantasy world of Norrath.<br>
<br>
And THAT is was made the accomplishment of the quest special to me.  It wasn't the stats, the bash ability, the proc, the graphics, or the fact that I 'had my epic'.  Dozens of people (over the span of months and many hours raiding) assembled to help me complete my quest for no reason other than to show their gratitude towards me.<br>
<br>
And that is why even a banked FD will mean more to me than a Paladius's Axe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udunthorwarsmith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunthor Warsmith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 3:32:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13149.topic&index=69>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: epics upgraded </span><hr size=1> Kether Am I I think makes the best argument so far posted in this thread. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uqaldaenastarrdancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qaldaena Starrdancer</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/5/01 6:33:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13149.topic&index=70>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: epics upgraded </span><hr size=1> /agree Dunthor<br>

<br>
Paladins/SKs -- can't use epic on raids. Switch to a non-proc'ing 2h, or non-proc'ing 1h + shield...<br>
<br>
Warriors -- don't bother, quest takes too long, pick up a pair of TOV swords instead.<br>
<br>
Important epics? Cleric/enchanter/mage. Those are the ones we seem to actively work on assisting, the others require the majority of the work to be done by the individual on their own time and for the raids to not occur when there is something scheduled -- TOV/Tormax/Dain/Yelinak/WW/etc.<br>
<br>
So, that being said... why would I want to get the FD? For the status symbol? I'll pass on that bit of egotism. I don't want my epic because it's &quot;the epic&quot;. I would want it to make myself more useful to my friends and to the guild.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of ways I can do that, and none of them require that one item. Now clerics, the epic adds a very vital and useful ability that is unique to their epic. If the paladin epic version 2.0 has &quot;AE Silence for 20 seconds&quot; as a trigger/proc... then I'd sink my time into it and sink the time of my friends and guild as well, because of the ability that I would have to help them.<br>
<br>
However, I don't buy into the &quot;if it didn't have the bottleneck, everyone would have it&quot; part.<br>
<br>
If you're right then I'm sure that everyone has a Qeynos Badge of Honor. I mean, there's no real bottleneck in the quest, anyone with a couple of friends of high enough level can complete the quest. Some minor timers involved but nothing at all restrictive. Most of it can even be done by one person, the others just make it easier and more certain (since it doesn't work like the ring, if you screw up you have to start from the beginning).<br>
<br>
QBoH is a perfect example of a quest which is difficult (there's too many ways to screw it up or have it screwed up) but requires only a modicum of effort applied into it... and a lot of time and personal investment.<br>
<br>
Let's take another example more dear to our hearts -- Divine Might. There are no bottlenecks to this quest, other than bone respawn times if multiple people want to do it at the same time. One person can acheive most of this quest on their own... and yet there are a lot of pallies who don't have this. (I say this because I've got everything for this quest except for a diamond, the &quot;special&quot; fire gem, and the Kedge bone... which I _could_ theoretically get myself, just not with a large survival chance).<br>
<br>
Just my opinion.<br>

What about the original post?

Sorry but that is just completely wrong.<br>
On quite a few servers (read most) Trakanon/VS etc have been done by pickups and on some pickup raids hold slots on rotations of these mobs so don't tell me that they couldn't handle Serv/Talendor. Hell a few weeks ago on EMarr a &quot;pickup&quot; raid led by one of my friends cleared up to and including the 7th island of the plane of air so I think they could have beat a single moderate str dragon had they been inclined to do so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=13149.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=13149.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=13149.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13765.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13764.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13149.topic&index=74><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=13149.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=13149.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13149.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13149.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Holy Swords and Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm8">Epic Quests<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm9">Paladin Polls<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge(read only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathclassdiscussion">Class Discussion<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might(Roleplay Tavern)<option value="paladinsofnorrathdiscoverkunarkitemszones">Discover Kunark!
