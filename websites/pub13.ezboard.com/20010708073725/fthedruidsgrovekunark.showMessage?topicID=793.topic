I was just wondering if anyone else has seen or killed this guy.  By the time I got back to the zone and regrouped, he had either been killed or despawned, but I am curious to know if he drops anything cool or interesting. <p><HR align="center" size="2" width="50%">

Lose the Thorn buff. any damage done to a Summoning<br>
mob will cause them to summon you. You will die!!<br>
<br>
Pull only with snare. Or aggro. Pull Doom with snare<br>
since he runs almost at sow speed snared. He summons.<br>
But wont summon unless hes Hurt.GET THAT IN YOUR HEAD!!<br>
<br>
Never ever damage a mob during the pull if you wish<br>
to be alive long enough to get to the pull<br>
to your group.<br>
<br>
The MR will save your hide during the pull. At least<br>
get it to 95+<br>
<br>
Root the mobs you pick up on the pull with ensnaring<br>
roots. Since it's a 1.8 cast time Its great.<br>
<br>
When you have aggroed many mobs. If you have it.<br>
Cast egress to eliminate any aggro you have left<br>
behind you.<br>
<br>
Always have Cheatah up and ready. Chances are your<br>
gate will not get off if your in big trouble.<br>
Heh Trak is full of shaman rooters. MR MR MR....<br>
<br>
These are the basics. Rules are strict on Hurt pulling.<br>

No, you have to do at least 10% of their total hit point of damage before they start summoning.  If a 5 to 6hp thorn (or in my case, bladecoat) is gonna do 10% of their total hit point of damage, you'll be dead long before you get summoned (especially since against doom you'll most likely be exchanging 6hps for 150+hps smacks).<br>
<br>
There aren't too many &quot;rare&quot; named mobs in Trak that's over level 51 so the odds of you getting summoned is pretty low.  But definately keep your MR up since those stupid froggie shamans do root A LOT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dr00dlfg>dr00dLFG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/27/01 9:40:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utulasbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TulasBrell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/29/01 11:19:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> The hunter cycle appears to be slightly higher level than the forager cycle. In doing the forager cycle countless times I have never once been summoned, and often pull with fury of air.  So the whole ruleset about MR just posted above I would say is not really necessary for Trak pulling if you are just doing the forager cycle.<br>
<br>
I also would not recommend casting egress to remove agro. Egress costs a huge amount of mana, has a long casting time and takes you to another part of the zone. Much simpler to just camp out now and then between pulls to wipe the agro list.  <br>
<br>
Camping is better to remove agro than egress, and gate is better to escape than egress. Egress was simply only good as a nice little in-zone travel spell to get some where faster till verant ruined it by making the zone reload to remove agro.<br>
<br>
Spirit of Cheetah is also something I wouldn't recommend as it is short duration and takes a valuable spell slot.  Plus it overrides sow, so that when it fades you no longer have any speed boost. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umulerin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulerin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/30/01 6:53:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Pull only with snare.

<br>
Dispell is a great way to pull casters.  Another thing to do is to root the pet of the mob if they have one.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lose the Thorn buff. any damage done to a Summoning mob will cause them to summon you. You will die!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Keep the thorncoat line up.  Any mob that can summon you from whacking your coat will die from you meleeing it because it'll have no hps.  Dmg shield is another story.<br>
<br>
&quot;Root the mobs you pick up on the pull with ensnaring roots. Since it's a 1.8 cast time Its great.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, I'd prefer ensnare.  Same cast time, less likely to be resisted, and typically you're pulling from a long distance so you'll lose the mob during the run.  Finally, then you have 10 mins of constant pulling while that mob is pissed at you instead of the duration of root (max 3 mins).<br>
<br>
&quot;When you have aggroed many mobs. If you have it. Cast egress to eliminate any aggro you have left behind you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Or obviously zone/camp out.  Why blow the mana when you can outrun any mob in Trak's teeth that isn't on the cycle and just zone?<br>
<br>
&quot;But wont summon unless hes Hurt.GET THAT IN YOUR HEAD!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Any druid doing this cycle that doesn't know that is 1) Ebay 2) Too low a lvl to be doing the cycle anyway.<br>
<br>
Final thing: Use the terrain to your advantage.  I always keep lev up because hills and lakes slow mobs down, while I'm running away from them.<br>

<br>
Here's how it works.  A mob will not summon unless it has been damaged (ANY amount will do), and then it will summon whoever is highest on its agro list.  I've personally ran away from and zoned on guardian wurms quite a few times when I stepped too close.  They never summon me unless I damage them (which I will never do unless I'm looking to die fast).  If you doubt this, here is a simple way that will prove it.  Get your guild and go down to the Juggs.  As soon as the tanks agro the Jug, cast Fixation of Ro on it.  They really like it when Druids use this spell on them.  I promise, you will get an immediate invitation to join Mr. Jugg, and you will notice that YOU'VE done NO damage.  I assume you've already noticed this?  So where are you coming up with this 10% figure?<br>
<br>
Obviously, you've never pulled TT.  You have thorncoat, he hits you, he gets damaged, he summons, you die.  You don't believe?  Go try it! :)<br>

Oh yeah dispell is the ultimate pulling tool.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cron</A> at: 5/1/01 6:21:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umulerin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulerin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/1/01 6:30:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> Naluvien - You're correct in your example but the conclusion you draw is incorrect...<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, when I said cast I non-damage spell so you didn't get summoned I assumed everyone know what I was saying.  The correct phrasing is you should use a spell that isn't considered as massive damage to the mob to pull it.  The 5 to 10% figure IS correct after all.  That is why you can root mobs once or twice w/out being summoned (you still do 150+ dmg) but after repeated roots you will be summoned.  That is also why when you heal (counted at dmg done to a mob on aggro list), cast Ro's Fiery (debuff counted as dmg to aggro list), etc you get summoned.  The amount of aggro is larger than that 5%-10%...so story is to pull w/dispell, ensnare, flamelick, or any other lvl 1 dd which is guarenteed to be below the summoning threshhold.<br>
<br>
I personally like dispell because ensnare has a larger value and will get you aggro'd faster if you heal during the fight.  Also, I hate (in most cases) having to run a snared mob long distances, as is the case in Trak's Teeth and finally, dispell will get rid of those annoying Frog Shaman buffs that the hunter/forager get while wandering. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utippen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tippen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/2/01 6:33:03 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> Why cast anything to pull the rares?

Because sometimes the forager or rare is near another MOB and you don't want to agro the other one. And because sometimes the forager or rare is zig zagging and hard to catch and stopping to cast a spell pulls him more efficiently. When possible, just running into it to agro it is the best way, but it's not always possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utippen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tippen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/3/01 6:01:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> One of the cool things with Trak's Teeth is that mobs lose interest REAL quick if you get far from them.

I pull there a lot and the only mob I bother to pull with a spell is Doom (hehe... tried aggro pulling him once, result was dead halfling... he's fast!).<br>

That said, we usually do the forager cycle, so I'm not as familiar with all the hunter cycle rares.<br>

IF A MOB IS AT 90% OF ITS HP LEVEL OR LESS, IT CAN SUMMON.  It will summon anyone who's aggroed it.<br>
It doesn't matter whether YOU do the damage or not.  If you haven't touched a mob but your tanks have, and you snare too soon, it will summon you. <p><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">

It is one of those spells which look great on paper but in practice doesn't cut it.  10-15 minute load time sure doesn't help, and it doesn't last that long either. Only 8 spell slots to go around and mine are full with spells I must have memmed.<br>
<br>
Also, please keep in mind that in trak's teeth a good puller must weave around MOBs constantly, and that is much harder if you are going too fast.  If one does use SoC anyway, I sure hope people don't run back to their group, as the number one rule of pulling is don't train your group.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ublackwulf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blackwulf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/5/01 9:57:19 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/Blackwulf?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anyone seen Hierophant Ixyl in Trak's Teeth?</span><hr size=1> SoC as a defining spell....okay,whatever.  I've memmed it a handful of times in 56 levels, used it less.  Only place I habitually mem it is pulling in Fear.  The long recast/refresh time, the overwrite of SoW/wolfform, its never proven worthwhile to me.  Snare and SoW do just fine 99.9% of the time for me.<br>

Summoning mobs.  Follow with me the rules of summoning mobs:<br>
<br>
1)51st level +<br>
2) you are on the agro list (your actions, simple passed agro, whatever)<br>
3) the mob takes 10% + damage from _any source.<br>
<br>
If these three conditions are met, the mob will start summoning.  I work the 'named' cycle in SF a lot, and many of the mobs I pull are potentially 51st+.  IF I root/drones of doom then, then drop a lightnig strike off the lum stick, that's when I find out the hard way if they summon.<br>
<br>
Simple passed agro is enough to get you killed in Skyfire.  Pair of mages I know were working the BW zone, had a wurm (simple wurm, never summons) run and get away.  o~o  Short while later, one of the mages gets summoned out in the middle of the zone and killed by a mob he had never seen.<br>

MR is nice in TT, the shaman are annoying.  When I'm feeling a touch paranoid, I buff RM.  But, normally I just have lev, wolf, bladecoat and invis when I pull.  Sometimes SLN, and/or regen, if I got beat on.  Works just fine, thanks to the level difference.  When I was a 51st druid soloing for his seb key, then I was buffing RM all the time, and needed it. <p>Blackwulf, 55th druid <BR>

If none of you are ever using this spell then your missing out on a spell that'll save your life better than any other spell we have.  You guys ever run into anything that moves at SOW speed(Avengers/Elites/Chief buffed by oracle in EW, Doom in TT, Death Squads, Othmirs, etc)?  If so how did you get away?  Maybe you got that lucky Gate off when they were double hitting you for 150, or you luckily zoned as they were on your ass SoW'd hitting you as you ran.  In most cases your dead, since your only option is to Gate or zone.  Good luck getting that gate off or finding that zone everytime before they pound you to death.  I ALWAYS keep SoC mem'd when i'm outdoors, and i cant tell you how many times its saved my ass.  From SoW'd avengers to SoW'd Othmirs when i've had 1 bub of life left, i've made it out alive because of SoC, nothing else we have would've saved me since there is no way i'm gonna get a gate off when i have multiple mobs double hitting me for 100's.  Heh, i'm not gonna even debate this if anybody disagrees with the usefulness of SoC but all i can tell you is your missing out big time if you dont ever keep it mem'd.  <br>
<br>
The thing is even though it only lasts a short duration, in that time you can almost always get far enough away to lose aggro as long as your running straight in that direction.  We've all had SOW run out at the worst times right?  Just SoC then recast SOW once SoC fades.  The ONLY times i dont have it mem'd are when i'm indoors(interchange with Gate) or grouped(altho sometimes still keep mem'd but usually not because i usually stay and die with group).  I look at SoC as one of our most valuable and most underrated spells, to me the equivalent of a life saver as feign Death.  I cant emphasize enough the usefulness of this spell =).<br>
<br>
In terms of summoning mobs, i had experience with Yvolcarn in CS who summons.  He's now hit me 2 separate times when i've had Thorncoat up and i never got summoned.  Heh, maybe my SoC right after i see 'Yvolcarn hits you for 100' prevented the summoning, who knows?, but i've yet to be summoned from a summoning mob hitting my thorncoat.  Although i dont get hit too often by summoning mobs if i can help it.  <br>
