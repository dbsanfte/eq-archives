Just have time for a quick note, will post more tonight, I have lots of comments that will take quite a while to type in.<br>
<br>
First, log files are worthless. When you fizzle, you don't get the &quot;you start to cast..&quot; message, it just says &quot;Your spell fizzles&quot;. So going back to the logs doesn't help, you have to run a trial and keep a running total.<br>
<br>
I'm level 57, had 202 WIS at the time of the trials, Evoc 235, Spec:evoc 200.<br>
<br>
I did the cast, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;d&quot; thing. Additionally, I have also noticed that if you spam the spell key, you will get chain fizzles. If you fizzle, wait at least 2 seconds before casting again. Case in point, my BoR trial netted only 3 back-to-back fizzles, and no triple or higher fizzles, in over 300 trials. Three nights ago, I fizzled Ensnare (level 29, RARELY fizzles) 5 times in a row!!! But I was spamming the button. I see this happen a lot, with all spells, spamming on a fizzle = chain fizzles.<br>
<br>
Anyway quickly, 303 casts of BoR, 47 fizzles = 15.5% fizzle rate.<br>
<br>
320 casts of WD, 4 fizzles = 1.3% fizzle rate<br>
<br>
I'll post some of my other comments tonight when I have time.<br>

<br>
I addressed this above.  General consensus is wrong.  The "chain fizzle" phenomenon is simply an artifact of perception.   You will see doubles and triples (or even more) for spells with high fizzle rates, just as a matter of the higher fizzle rate.  In fact, it would be suspect if you didn't see chain fizzles over a long series of tests.<br>
<br>
In my tests, the spells that had the "floor" fizzle rate of 3% (or so), rarely had double fizzles.  I saw one or two sets of double fizzles.  I was mashing the spell cast key by ducking to interrupt the spells (about 2 attempts per second at my best), so if there were a chain fizzle phenomenon, I would have seen it here.<br>
<br>
I did see many more double fizzles with spells fizzling in the 15% to 20% range.  I also saw triples with the Circle of Winter series, which had close to a 30% fizzle rate.  With a 30% fizzle rate, the odds of getting three sequential fizzles with CoW is .3*.3*.3 = 3%, or just about the same chance as getting a single fizzle with Winged Death.  I'd be surprised if I did NOT see triple fizzles with CoW.<br>
<br>
The Chain Fizzle theory springs from the assumption that the fizzle rate for the spell being cast is something on the order of 3% to 5%.   Bad assumption. For several spells, it's 10x higher.<br>
<br>
In other words, I saw no support for a chain fizzle phenomenon.  Just simple random chance in action.<br>

<br>
Gotta disagree on this one.  Back in the days I used to get chain fizzles all the time, it was ALWAYS from mashing the spell key.  Once I noticed this and stopped mashing, my fizzles stopped chaining.<br>
<br>
When I ran my 300+ BoR test, I did the cast, duck, duck.  However, I would just count the successfull casts as I went along, and once I had a fizzle, I would stop and write down the results for that run.  Then I'd start casting again.  This prevented the &quot;chain-fizzle&quot; effect.<br>
<br>
I'm further convinced, because the ONLY time I see &quot;floored&quot; spells chain fizzle, is when I'm mashing the key.  They NEVER chain fizzle if I'm waiting a bit before recasting (which is usually my habit since I noticed this).<br>
<br>
I will try to run a test of this using a low cost, fast-casting, quick recast spell on myself. Probably Burst of Flame.  With Natureskin, won't even notice the damage.  I'll do one trial like above, casting until a fizzle, then writing it down.  That will give me an idea of how often it fizzles.  Then I will run another test, where I just mash the key constantly.  If it goes off, I'll just get &quot;you may not do that command now..&quot; or whatever it says.  If it fizzles, well then we'll see if it's more prone to chain fizzling or not.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS - LOL to whoever it was above that said it was quick to run a test of BoR with hundreds of casts, using duck.  I think it was Scirroco, with an 8% fizzle rate.  My fizzle rate was 15.5%, and after 24 fizzles, I was OOM from the fizzles, and had to med back up =)  (This was just from fizzles, I never let BoR complete before ducking, and started at FM)<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, how much mana does a fizzle use, half?<br>

250 mana for the spell<br>
10 cast worth pool<br>
23 casts worth of fizzles drain pool<br>

43 percent of 250<br>
thats about 110 mana drained per fizzle<br>

If my math is off,,,one of you number jockys please post the real math.<br>

That is going from FOM to OOM.  But a data set of 23 fizzles could hardly be called scientific.<br>

<br>
I am basing my conclusions on my testing and observations.  I deliberately did NOT stop whenever I had a fizzle, because I was trying to secondarily test the chain fizzle theory.  I would just spam cast on through and stop only on nonfizzles.   Which is why I said that if there were such a thing as chain fizzling, I would have seen it. <br>
<br>
Of course, if there is such a thing as chain fizzling, there may be such a thing as chain successes.  If the first is based on some quirk of the RNG, then that same quirk would work for successes as well.  If you are going to test this, you should wait 5 or 10 seconds between each attempted cast, regardless of success or fizzle.<br>
<br>
<br>
With a 3% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 0.09%.  Or about 1 in 1000.  Which is what I was seeing with my low fizzle rate spells. <br>
<br>
With a 10% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 1%, or 1 in 100.  You should be seeing a number of double fizzles sequences with these spells.  The odds of a triple fizzle sequence are 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<br>
<br>
With a 30% fizzle rate, the odds of seeing a double fizzle are 9%, or 1 in 10.  The odds of a triple fizzle are 2.7%.  The odds of a quadruple fizzle are 0.08%, or about 1 in 1000.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have an open mind and am willing to be convinced otherwise.  But you'll have to show me the numbers to do so.<br>

<br>
Hitting cast, duck, duck gets repetetive (I know, it can mesmerize you after a while =).  Were you (out of habit) hitting duck twice even after a fizzle?  Cause if you were, that's still spacing out your casts of the spell, and is two more casts of the spell one could have done quickly, if they were spamming.<br>
<br>
Just curious, and want to understand.<br>
<br>
When I run my experiement tonight, this will be my criteria for judging whether chain-fizzling exists or not.  I will find a low fizzle spell, and if I can get it to chain fizzle an order of magnitude more than its base fizzle rate would indicate, then I'll be convinced.<br>
<br>
I started a thread on this a month or two back that got no/little response.  It's interesting to see it pop up again.<br>
<br>
My theory is that fizzling is determined by the server, and if a fizzle is received, and you spam the key before the server can be contacted again, or before it decides to reset the random number, you automatically get another fizzle.<br>
<br>
The concept of &quot;chain successes&quot; came up.  In normal operations, this is impossible, since cast time + recast time automatically spaces out the casts.  For the purposes of my experiment, just ducking twice after each cast spaces em out a bit.  That's why my idea for tonight's experiment calls for no ducking, and just spamming the key constantly, through casts and fizzles.  I will probably use Burst of Flame or Flame Lick, both low damage, low mana spells.<br>
<br>
Now, onto the other comments I alluded to in the post earlier today, in the other thread:<br>
<br>
Where the hell did the numbers for total damage for our DoTs come from, and don't say spdat, cause they don't add up.<br>
<br>
I looked at Scirocco's thread in the archive re:DoT damage, and I'm inclined to agree with the numbers he comes up with, his method is well done.  Even if you may disagree with him on the total damage, there's little disagreement with his info on the number of ticks each spell lasts.  So look at this:<br>
<br>
Commonly accepted numbers (pre-Scirocco) for our DoTs:<br>
Wrath of Nature 1650    30 ticks<br>
Winged Death    1287    10 ticks<br>
Breath of Ro       920     11 ticks<br>
Drifting Death     650     11 ticks<br>
Drones of Doom  350     11 ticks<br>
Immolate           240     11 ticks<br>
Creeping Crud     210    11 ticks<br>
Stinging Swarm   117    10 ticks<br>
<br>
Now, with the exception of WoN, none of the totals are round multiples of the ticks.  So you're telling me that spdat says WD does 128.7 dmg/tick?  I don't think so!  I can't believe I never noticed this before!<br>
<br>
That brings me to my second comment.  Scirocco mentions that there is a 12% bonus to DoT damage if the mob is not pursuing, a 1/3 penalty if it is.  What I can't figure out is, 12% of what?  Below is Scirocco's #'s for DoTs, then compared with what used to be the accepted numbers:<br>
<br>
Wrath of Nature: 1770 ( 59/tick, 30 ticks)       7.2% greater<br>
Winged Death:    1560 (156/tick, 10 ticks)      21.2% greater<br>
Breath of Ro:    1089 ( 99/tick, 11 ticks)      18.4% greater<br>
Drifting Death:   759 ( 69/tick, 11 ticks)      16.8% greater<br>
Drones of Doom:   374 ( 34/tick, 11 ticks)       6.9% greater<br>
Immolate:         242 ( 22/tick, 11 ticks)       0.8% greater<br>
Creeping Crud:    209 ( 19/tick, 11 ticks)      -0.5% (less)<br>
Stinging Swarm:   110 ( 11/tick, 10 ticks)      -6.0% (less)<br>
<br>
As you can see, none of them is 12% greater than the old accepted values, and some are actually less.  I have a feeling this is due to the fact that the old values are pretty much junk.  So what I'm curious about is, where did this concept of a 12% bonus come from?  I agree with the total damage done (per tick), but what, exactly, is it a 12% bonus of.  And if it's the number in SPDAT, then why are the old numbers not also based on SPDAT?<br>

That spaced it out all of an additional half second at most.  I was not kidding when I said I could get at least two attempts off per second when I was in the groove.<br>
<br>
I don't think this adds any significant additional spacing out time...at least, no more than clicking on the spell to recast it after a fizzle will add.   <br>
<br>
As for the DoTs, the 12% is not based on the status of the mob.  It simply is an estimate of how much additional damage the DoT will do in the game over the "listed" amounts (which are from the spell data file).   You get this amount by measuring the amount of damage the DoT does to you, and backing out the PvP reduction (which is based on the damage done to mobs by your DDs vs. the damage the DD does to you, and varies by level of the spell). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rtfm>rtfm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1099<br> <font color=#333399>(2/22/02 8:00:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> update</span><hr size=1> 126  attempts<br>

Tat, what is your wisdom, btw.  We are the same level.  I have been testing using only 200 wis.<br>
<br>
It may give us some clue as to the effect of higher wisdom effects on fizzles.  My fizzling seems to be much higher than yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukalinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 547<br> <font color=#333399>(2/22/02 10:29:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=78.topic&index=33>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/azurecrayon/wolf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: update</span><hr size=1> as i already suggested, the consecutive fizzles are inevitable with BoR.  the huge fizzle rate makes it 10 times more likely to get a consecutive fizzle than with WD.  when you average 1 fizzle out of every 4-5 casts, the fizzles come much closer together, and thus are more likely to fizzle right after each other.<br>
<br>
im not sure whether a higher consecutive fizzle rate would be just perception or fact however.  when i ran my 500 trials, i did so in sets of 100, stopping only after each set.  when i had a fizzle i immediately tried recasting (trying to shorten the trial time by constant casting).  i actually came out with a lower consecutive fizzle rate than i was expecting. <p>-K<br>

Been running my trials with 202 WIS.<br>
<br>
Yeah, your fizzles are running WAY higher than mine.  In my 300+ trials, I only had 3 double fizzles, and no triple or higher.  And less than half the fizzle rate you saw.  Are you Evoc specced?<br>
<br>
Regarding the chain fizzle experiment, got busy tonight and didn't have time.  Perhaps tomorrow.<br>

I only had time to do 100 casts of each spell, but the results are in line with everyone else, so I think it's a good sample.  Casting skills are only 235, but that's the max for level 55.<br>
<br>
Level 55<br>
Wisdom 201<br>
Abjuration skill 235<br>
Alteration skill 235<br>
Evocation skill 235<br>
Spec: Abjuration 50<br>
Spec: Alteration 200<br>
Spec: Evocation 50<br>
<br>
Evocation spells (100 casts each):<br>
Breath of Ro, level 52, 40 fizzles (40%) &lt;---- Yikes!<br>
Scoriae, level 54, 3 fizzles (3%)<br>
<br>
Alteration spells (100 casts each):<br>
Spirit of Eagle, level 54, 2 fizzles (2%)<br>
Chloroblast, level 55, 3 fizzles (3%)<br>
<br>
Abjuration spells (100 casts each):<br>
Circle of Winter, level 51, 25 fizzles (25%)<br>
Circle of Summer, level 52, 20 fizzles (20%)<br>
Legacy of Spike, level 51, 3 fizzles (3%)<br>
<br>
I threw in LoS just for comparison purposes to make sure that *all* abjuration spells weren't fizzling.  That was the highest level Abjuration spell I could find other than the Circles.<br>
<br>
It's obvious to me that Bor, Cow, Cos are broken fizzle wise.  Scoriae which is a higher level spell than BoR didn't fizzle any more than expected (2-3%).  Yet BoR which is now 3 levels below my level, fizzles 40% of the time. <p><center><font size=-2><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52964">Brienna Starrfyre</a>, level 54 human monk<br>
