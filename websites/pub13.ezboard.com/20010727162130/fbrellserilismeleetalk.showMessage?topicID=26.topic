Regardless of monk vs paladin, the best solo class in EQ appears to be a necromancer.

<br>
That being said of course, I rarely solo, and it does take a LONG time to solo using this method, at least with higher blues, and low blue cons outside of kunark (i.e. dars in guk) are a piece of cake.  <br>
<br>
However I've also seen kambing in guk and it's pretty neat to watch...but as dynin said, this is &quot;Monks vs Paladins&quot; which is assuming your average 50+ monk vs average 50+ pally.  A monk with 20hp regen is NOT your average monk, just like a paladin with 20 hp regen would be able to solo a hell ofalot better as well.  I think he might have a bit harder time against kunark blues though. <br>

<br>
At level 50, when I have the chance, I will solo spectres in Oasis or Feerrott.  The ones that I get experience for will typically hit for up to 95 HP or so.  Sometimes, the fight gets very close.  Other times, I have lost less than a bubble of HP.  Regardless, the fight will often start with me pulling it and then attempting to instill doubt.<br>
<br>
On one occasion, I was extremely lucky and was able to fear kite 2 spectres to death for experience back to back (both were roaming and killing teenage PCs).  This was immediately followed by a bout with a sand giant.  Using this technique, and with some luck, I think a monk of level 49 could solo the gypsie merchant.  Soloing with fear/instill doubt can be a really vicious tactic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udikamin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dikamin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(8/1/00 8:05:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.freeweb.pdq.net/trueknight/images/Dikamin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Monks VS Paladins, which is the better soloer?</span><hr size=1> I play both a paladin and a monk so I think I can answer this question. (at least to lvl 40)<br>
<br>
Below 22:<br>
Paladins suck at these lvls. No double attack until 20. Light healing is no good during battle. Can't root mobs. I can't solo an even mob below lvl 10 (maybe different if today's paladins can obtain some bronze at this lvl). Paladins are only good at soloing undeads between 15 and 20. Monks are not as good as warriors at these lvls, but IMO they are still better than paladins to solo.<br>
<br>
22-29:<br>
Paladins get better now, but still in no way compared to monks since monks start getting faster with their fists and upgraded special attack, unless the paladin has GB.<br>
<br>
30-38:<br>
Most paladins get their GB at this lvl and can dish out good damage now. They can do some healing in battle now. They can start getting their class armor now. However monks can get some good weapons like fighting baton and Wu's trance stick at this lvl so their damage is still much better than paladins and they get flying kick now. I still feel my monk solo better than paladin at these lvl even in dungeons, if he can find a place that a mob is unlikely to find its friends. My monk can clear all the zone trashes in Lower Guk at 35 solo (except maybe ghoul wizards) with FD skill which I think would be very hard to do for any other classes. Without weapons a monk may equal to a paladin at this lvl. (just a guess)<br>
<br>
39-50:<br>
Paladins get greater healing now and I found them to be very good at earlier between these lvls. At lvl 40 I can solo spectres in Feerrott with spook the dead which would be impossible for a monk at lvl 40. However at lvl advance my melee skills doesn't improve so the damage is very slow. Your GB is still your best weapon. Often takes me very long time to finish a mob and you only hit better because of lvls but not skills. I don't have DW helm at the moment and I may not consider acquiring it even for the daring effect. Of course without a DW helm a paladin can never be better than a monk. (at least before 50, can't tell about 50+) I think paladins would be better than monks when fighting caster mobs with bash and stun spells and monks have lower hp and resists (unless he specifically wears some resist gears). My monk doesn't seem to be able to solo a blue wizard.<br>
<br>
I think paladin is not for soloing. Paladin is good for group with his healing ability especially in a group with no pure healers. My best experience groups have only 2 paladins doing all the healing and tanking (I have been in such a group twice). I play more of my monk when my paladin is over lvl 40 (well another reason is I don't want to wait for group) until I find that paladin can be that good in a group and I start to enjoy my paladin than before. I will still play my monk though. I am only unhappy with his poor offensive ability.<br>
<br>
IMO monk is the best solo melee class. (SK may be good too though but I don't play one and there are so few SK around so I can't tell) <p>Dikamin, Level 51 Cavalier of Brell Serilis<BR>Ganaddor, Level 40 Sao Lin monk of Norrath<BR>United Norrathian Brotherhood<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uzenthan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zenthan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(9/7/00 10:05:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Monks VS Paladins, which is the better soloer?</span><hr size=1> Ya know....  if you wanna solo...

Post 40 spells, and pre 49 spells:  Journeyman's Boots, Stun, Root,  250+ hp buff, 17 or so + ac buff, Greater Healing, and Bandaging.  Sow yourself anytime during battle, takes approximately 0.5 - 1.0 seconds, easily done inbetween hits.  Stun the mob, root the mob, back off and bandage/heal.  Get some distance, pull out your bow (if you have one, I don't), and nail him, heal, nail, heal...<br>
<br>
That's without DW items, all Ro gear, FBSS, and Soulfire.  We don't do damage?  For some reason I am doing a lot more triple attacks lately =), some equaling 200 damage a round, the rest are double attacks or very quick singles.  Doubles I can pull down 80's and 90's per hit, so 160 - 180.  Singles are relatively 50's - 90's.<br>
<br>
That said, I would hang it out in the wind and place my money on a paladin.<br>
<br>
Oh, did I mention the AE Fear that a mob has to sv. vs. when he see's this flaming sword jabbing him? hehehe.<br>
<br>
As for monks...well, its impressive that you folks can fill an entire screen of 10 or more lines with hits, doing 20's and 30's, perhaps more, I can't recal full amounts, without being hit yourself.  But the ac difference, and relying on whether FD will work or not is too risky.

If it just won't stick, shadowstep, FD, and I'm safe. I see no equipment needed... <br>
Till 15, the Monk has both the pally and his dark opposite beat, it's all about the damage then. Even after 15, I'll hazard the monk being better than the pally, just because he can pour on the damage, and he's more likely to survive, and mend and bandaids will cut his down time significantly.  <p>--<br>

<br>
My main concern against soloing, is that when your in a group if things go bad, and you have a good group, it means that many more people to help you recover.<br>
<br>
Dying alone, and very far from your bind point, can negate many hours of hard work.<br>
<br>
The single fact in my opinion which makes any melee class incapable of good soloing is that we can't bind were we choose. <p><br>
