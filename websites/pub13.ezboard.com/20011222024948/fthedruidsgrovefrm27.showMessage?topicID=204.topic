<br>
I played EQ for over 2 years (recently retired to explore my options), and have had my share of high lvl play.  I've seen how things used to be, and how it is now.  Anyone who started playing EQ since the early days will have experienced many random acts of kindness.  Things ranging from offering to TP someone who is lost for free, or rezzing someone you come across out of the kindness of your heart for free, etc.  Anyone who plays today knows that doesn't happen much anymore unless it's a close friend whom you've befriended since lvl 6, or guildmates who are often bound by obligation (I'm not saying all guildmates are, but we all know that some are only doing it because it said so in the guild charter. ;) ) As people advanced through the levels, they have their own concerns, and goals to worry about.  In other words, the EQ community, the compassion, the concerns for fellow players, have degenerated.  <br>
<br>
Now I do realize that some people can be rather sensitive when the topic of helping each other arises, so before I go any further, allow me to state this:  Please note that I do realize that there are still plenty of honorable and noble people in EQ who are more than willing to help others, but you must admit, they're a dying breed.  I've met friends in EQ that I shall cherish for a long time to come, and many of them play DAoC with me. If not, I stay in contact with them via email.  :)<br>
<br>
That being said:<br>
<br>
Last night while hunting in Muire's Tomb in DAoC, my entire group of 7 got wiped out during a bad pull and a train combo.  We died in a fairly high traffic intersection of the dungeon, so me being one of the rezzers didn't panic. (For those who don't know, you cannot rez yourself when you die in DAoC.) Why didn't I panic?  Because there have been numerous times when both my partner and I (or entire group) have been killed and a kind player with rez abilities came by and rezzed us without us asking.  <br>
<br>
When I first started playing and got rezzed by a stranger, I thought, &quot;WOW, that's really awful nice of this person.&quot;  I was never asked for a donation, or any favors.  A mere &quot;thank you&quot; was more than enough.  The more I played the more it seemed to me that people just did not mind rezzing other players.  They just walk by, see you dead, and bam! You're rezzed.  I think that it is this way because DAoC is designed to be RvR and rezzing someone within your realm is like helping a fellow comrade.  But could it also be that the game is still new and people haven't been jaded by the prospect of &quot;phat lewt?&quot;<br>
<br>
As I've mentioned before, during the early days of EQ, people were more willing to help a player in need of help.  But as the months and years went by, people became more powerful and discovered the riches of the land and soon realized that, &quot;hey I can provide a service that at LOT of people seek.  I should charge them (a lot in some cases) for it.  I mean why not?  I want xxx item because it would improve my game play.  I need to find SOME way to pay for it, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
So my questions to you, fellow DAoC players is this:  Do you foresee the DAoC community degenerating the way the EQ community has?  Do you think that somewhere down the line, players will have to beg for a rez and pay for it, otherwise the rezzer won't do it?  Granted in Mythic has designed DAoC to where it doesn't depend on ONE class for a group to be successful (or so it seems for now.) But do you see people becoming more and more apathetic towards fellow players?<br>
<br>
I enjoy the comradery within my realm in DAoC just as I did with EQ back in the days.  I'm curious to see what people think will become of this compassion.  :) <p><CENTER>

<br>
In Hiberia most buffs are concentration. So I've never expected my newbies to get buffs.  But every once in a while someone will buff me. I ifgure they're probably going off to solo so don't need all their conc.  Any time I or my group see a dead body we drop a res on it.<br>
<br>
I think the folks who were likely to be helpful at the begining will still be helpful at the end by and large.   <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

&quot;Please note that I do realize that there are still plenty of honorable and noble people in EQ who are more than willing to help others, but you must admit, they're a dying breed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I disagree. I do not think they are &quot;dying&quot; out by any stretch of the imagination. Those that help others and those that do not, in my opinion, still have the same ratio. As the player base decreases (or increases) i think that proportion remains the same. Then, as people begin spreading out in terms of levels, you might see an apparent lessening of good will. Its possible that some servers might be worse off than others, but day in and day out, I still see people willing to help others with no thought of reward. <br>
<br>
I know that I still help out those in need any time i can even being a 60th level cleric. But when you are in ToV or DN, etc, how often do i get the opportunity to do a drive-by res or buff? <br>
<br>
Basically, i know i havent changed and i dont think others that enjoy helping people have either. Sure, you might get some that get jaded and where they once were helpful now are not. But i think they are in the minority. <br>
<br>
I will close with one other thought. DaoC is a PvP game eventually. So everyone you meet is pretty much on the same team. I can see where this could lead to more helpful behavior since you all have a common thread. But just note that 2/3 of the players on the server will never ever give you a single second of help. Hehe.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/20/01 7:55:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .....</span><hr size=1> Well, they are different games and DAOC isnt really geared towards relying on other people, and personally i like it that way.  Other than resses, there isnt going to be much begging since people cant SOW or port them around.  You may call it degeneration when people ask money for their services, but imo thats part of an economy in any world.  People should be payed for their services, especially if they went out of their way to do it.  So, to answer your question, yes, i think there will come a time when clerics will ask for donations to find and ress your body.  Is that wrong?  Imo, not at all and i'd be more than happy to pay him for his time just like i was in EQ.   <br>
<br>
I have other concerns of how DAOC might inherit some of  the problems EQ had.  I'm more concerned about the Uber elite guilds that moved over from EQ who take over areas where average people like me are fighting.  It hasnt happened yet, but a guild could easily take over the small dungeons that exist.  I'm concerned about the player-rules and stereotypes that might carry over, just like some people already probably dislike those who play a Theurgist because they are considered the DAOC equivalent to 'droods'.  Or the player-made rules like claiming certain rooms or areas and it becomes just like calling for camp spots in EQ which is already evident from my experiences so far in the Tomb of Mithra.   <br>
<br>
Imo, DAOC degenerating would be all of the player-created socialisms and stigma's carrying over from EQ.  People not allowing pickup players into a group because their not comfortable with an 'outsider', or the seriousness people took everything because they were so afraid to die.  Where powerful guilds rule and it eventually becomes a battle between guilds for certain areas, much like Plane raids are in EQ.  <br>
<br>
Sadly, i do believe DAOC will degenerate in thsi manner, because theres not much you can do about how guilds develop, and their carryover goal being so similar to what it was in EQ.  So many players are from EQ that the stigma's and social aspects will also carry over, and imo thats a bad thing.  To be honest, i look at EQ as a game that had developed into a society where guilds had alot of social  power and wielded it inconsiderately in many cases.  There are very few big guilds in EQ where every member was kind and considerate, more often than not, it was mixed with kind people and assholes.  Of course the asses were subject to that double standard because they are their 'friends'.  Theres already a general impression from EQ that a guild or group takes precedence over anybody soloing.  I mean how often in EQ would you be at a nice spot and see a group or guild move in and just take it over?  <br>
<br>
Well, we'll see what happens.  The even sadder part is that i would rather have there be some camp spots, or rather more of a difference between killing mobs in one area as opposed to another.  I've run around all over the place and killing lots of different things outside.  Almost every spot i've been to outside has been the same where loot generally stunk and the only thing i could look forward to was leveling.  Of course these spots werent crowded nor camped which was the plus side, but the downside was i got real sick of the redundancy to just lvling and not looking forward to finding somehting cool drop.  Now that i'm in the Tomb, its all crowded with camp spots and people fighting everywhere, but at least i can look forward to seeing what drops and finally gettting some cool stuff to wear.  So i can at least look forward to killing a monster not just for exp. :P  I realize there are areas outside that have some good drops as well like those tree things, but those spots have become camped or somewhat crowded as well.  Mythic should really think about dispersing the decent loot droppings out more instead of concentrating it in certain areas.  That would help the problem of camping, but i guess thats what they were supposed to do in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usekiraashdelane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sekira Ashdelane</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/20/01 8:27:19 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .....</span><hr size=1>   Hehe often times I'll see someone die in DAoC and go to res them and before I finish casting their tombstone appears :)  Don't know if everyone but me has /release macroed or what, but they sure do type it fast! :P<br>

People are a bit too eager to /release and get it over with.  Had a 7th lvl player die at my group's feet last night when he got in way over his head.  We had 4 rezzers in our group and by the time I targetted his corpse he was gone.  Kinda felt bad though because he was a tad too low to be soloing in Muire and knew that after that experience (seemed like his first in there) he won't be going back to /pray at it. :(<br>
<br>
Badaf, I played a high lvl cleric, wizard, and a druid back in my EQ days and I've had my share of beggars.  Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment to constantly play classes that everyone wants something from. ~shrug~  I never had a problem performing run by buffings, rezzings, etc.  As a matter of fact, I relished in the joy of sitting atop orc hill or in Crushbone buffing newbies with my Donal's Vambraces and giving free 56th lvl rez (sans rez stick) to 10th lvl people just for fun during my I-don't-feel-like-lfg-today moods.  And from what I've read, a lot of people that visit this board doesn't have a problem with that either.  I know lots of people who enjoy doing that as well.  What I'm referring to are those who are too wrapped up in their own concerns to help people out.<br>
<br>
Case and point:<br>
<br>
I was playing my cleric with a necro buddy who asked a medding druid (who was soloing giants in GD) to ask him if he could port us to EJ so we could help a friend summon his corpse and rez him in Seb.  We offered to mana dump the druid for departure, and back to full upon arrival, and buffs including DMF, and full cleric buffs including symbol, and money if he so desired.  Personally if I was playing my druid, I would've jumped at that offer.  I mean...even with a TP, necro mana dump is significanly faster than medding, no?  There was nothing for him to lose other than a measly 5 minutes of zoning back and forth.  He would've spent that time medding otherwise.  But he said, &quot;no.  I need exp.&quot;  I have no doubts that had this happened 2 years ago, the druid would've helped us.  But now everyone's on a lvl, and l00t war.  The game no longer seems like a venue to meet and gather with friends for a common purpose, to defeat the enemy (be it PvP or PvE), but it's who has the better toys.  That my friend, is degeneration of people's compassion within a community.  I saw more and more people becoming apathetic each day.  Each day I saw someone new with the &quot;what's in it for me&quot; mentality.  It happens in RL too.  It's a sad reality.<br>
<br>
The game used to be filled with people who did rewardless good deeds.  Now it's more like &quot;well what can you do for me?&quot;  I once had someone send me a tell and said, &quot;can you rez me in CS?&quot;<br>
<br>
I replied, &quot;no I'm sorry I cannot rez you right now.  I'm currently buffing my group in preparations for the 10th Coldain ring war.&quot;  (Which I was.)<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll pay you 1k,&quot; he replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, I cannot right now.  I'm preparing for a raid,&quot; I repeated.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh man you're f*ucked up d00d.  I ported you once when you needed a port,&quot; he said trying to smack a guilt trip on me.<br>
<br>
&quot;First of all, I'm a female, and second, I thank you for your help, but that does not change my current situation.  If I was not a part of this raid, I would be glad to rez you, but right now, my commitment is to this raid,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who's your raid leader? I'll talk to him and have him excuse you,&quot;  he replied.<br>
<br>
At this point I'm thinking, &quot;WHAT?  Who does this schmuck think he is?&quot;  /ignore.<br>
<br>
Broomhilda I couldn't agree with you more.  Sure people should be paid for services, I mean hell...when was the last time you went to a doctor and they didn't charge you an arm and a leg for a mere checkup?  ;)  I have absolutely no problems with donating money to someone who just rezzed me.  Afterall, if they didn't do it I would've had to pay a healer to restore my constitution anyways, so why not pay a player?  At least he can do something with the money, the healer NPC won't do jack with the money I pay him.  However, I do have a problem with people who demand a certain price for a service.  The times I've sought out rezzes/TP with my non cleric/druid characters, I've had people tell me, &quot;for 100p,&quot; &quot;for 50p&quot; so on.  Or better yet, those who say &quot;TPing for donations&quot; then demanding a set price for their service.  Well that's not exactly a donation now is it?  I've always asked for other's services nicely because when people ask me for favors, I expect to be spoken to with respect.<br>
<br>
And I share the same concerns regarding &quot;uber d00ds/guilds&quot; as well, Broomhilda.  I see some of that happening already.  As a matter of fact, last night, at one point we had a uber d00dess in our group.  She wanted to go in deeper into the dungeon.  While the rest of us was capricious, we did it anyways for the challenge.  We had close to a full group.  First stop, we got wiped out by mobs that conned purple to us.  But yet she insisted on staying.   Our puller died 5 times in the span of 10 minutes trying to pull red and purple mobs.  After that, the majority of the group decided we should just head back.  The uber d00dess just disbanded without saying a word.  Well...I guess the rest of us with common sense just wasn't good enough for her.<br>
<br>
I guess time will tell.  To those who preserve nobility and compassion, I salute you.  Keep up the good work.  The world needs more people like you. :) <p><CENTER>

<br>
I don't think DAOC will degenerate quite as fast EQ, because the game is less geared toward competition with your realm mates.  In EQ, if you want to complete a quest (i.e., a campfest) or get a special item, you are almost forced to compete with everyone else.  DAOC is less geared towards dropped items and specific item camping.  Also, in EQ the only point is become an item/level collector; in DAOC, PvP and trade skills take some of the pressure off of itemquest/levelquest. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukiatek2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiatek2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/21/01 5:15:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What lies ahead for the DAoC Community?</span><hr size=1> on the question of releasing too fast, some ppl dont know you cant be ressed if you release.  Especially the lower levels, like a level 7 as was mentioned.  I had no clue at level 7 thats how ressing worked in DAOC.  i had never played to a level with anyone that could res or knew anyone that could res until later.<br>
<br>
As for random acts of kindness, I think there are tons still out there.  A person i grouped with one night gave me 5 gp at level 10!  he had a level 30ish char and said he wanted to help me even though he didnt know me.  I was amazed.  So i think the kindness stuff still exists.  <br>
<br>
gradually in EQ people become jaded and bitter and didnt want to help i think.  too many beggers, etc.  I dont forsee this happening extensively in DAOC (well soon anyway) because buffing requires concentration and when you zone/die buffs go anyway.

Second, Dewdplay in this game has a shorter lifespan.  Powerleveling is akin to trying to pass another driver to beat them to the red light.  You can't effectively twink with high level gear, and exp/item farms trickle out as you use them to the point where you are literally forced to move on.  How many of the folks who have quit the game already are quitting because they raced to 40+ and found out there wasn't any content for them yet?  How many are quitting because they aren't as uber as they were yesterday?<br>
<br>
As they get the rest of the content in, and we have more high level folks dying in strange locations, I can see where charaty might become a bit more strained.  (As you can only rezz someone as high as your concentration bar will allow.  If they have too much experience...they're stuck looking for someone more skilled).  Depending on how much people are still focused on trying to solo at that level, there may or may not be a problem.  Hard to say as of yet.<br>

I cant tell you how often people are looking for resses, even for groups who got wiped out.  I'm speaking mostly for concentrated areas, since outside is so spread out that most people will just release.  The exp loss is really starting to hurt me right now(lvl 13) and i cant imagine how much it hurts at higher lvls to just release.  So i guess anywhere where there might be a higher concentration of players in a dangerous environment, anybody that can ress will get a million requests depending on how many other ressers are in the area.  Its even worse that the body cant be dragged to the cleric/friar/etc.  I felt sorry for the one cleric in the tomb last night who must've been getting pounded with requests, but he seemed to be ignroing everybody.  I dont blame him since there were bodies everywhere and spawns popping so fast.<br>
<br>
I find the lack of content at higher lvls a problem, not really a buffer for fast-lvling 'dewds'.  People will reach that point eventually just like they did in AO.  There really shouldnt be an excuse for that by saying you shouldnt powerlvl, since 3/4's of the people in the game are concentrating on exp as fast as they can.  While there is RvR, there should also be other options imo as well for high lvl fun.  <br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of the way items and the economy are done so far, but i'm giving Mythic the benefit of the doubt since its still early.  I'm not a fan of the anti-twink codes these games(AO, DAOC) are putting in at all either, since all it does is narrow the margin of who you can deal with or who might be interested in what.  It was hard enough to sell stuff in EQ where everybody was a potential customer, now its 10 times more limited.  Its a step back imo, a model they should look to for player economy was UO which had no anti-twinking code and by far was/is the best player economy in any mmorpg.  In fact, the almost total focus on lvling in gameplay is really redundant right about now.  This is my personal opinion though, im sure others are happy with it.<br>

At least thats what I was told about those games since they never appealed to me. <p><center><img src="http://members.truepath.com/jadae/bunclover.jpg"><br><font size=2 color="#00FA9A"><a href="http://sacredfire.orionsafari.com" target="resource window"> The Sacred Fire</a></font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubroomhilda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Broomhilda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/23/01 9:14:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .....</span><hr size=1> Just for the record, its hard to say if EQ is more social than UO.  I dont know too much about AC since i only played it for about a month.  EQ is social because it forces you to be social, basically since gameplay revolves around grouping, and asking for favors.  Also, you have to factor in the rediculous downtime which contributes to talking while your sitting bored.  It sounds crazy but i'd bet DAOC would be more social if there was more group downtime.  But in DAOC more people are playing the game so they dont have all that time to kill to sit and talk unless they want to.  Also the DAOC interface is very lacking in terms of being social, as well as the player economy in part due to that stupid anti-twink code.  Same reason AO's player economy is so lame.<br>
<br>
Many people in UO are on irc or icq while in-game, also you have to realize that you can do stuff in UO outside of the game.  What i mean is if i want to get into real estate or any type of merchanting, i dont have to be in the game.  I can just use the very active trading boards and just meet in game to do the deals which is what most vet merchants do.  UO doesnt have the intercontinental chat interface EQ has tho, since what you say is only heard by the people around you.  That hurts the social aspect as well.  <br>
<br>
I guess your right, EQ probably is the most social game.  Imo its not entirely a good thing tho....<br>

By comparison, EQ guilds mostly remind me of a bad college fraternity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unadiabrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadia brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/24/01 6:22:23 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~karl23/_images/nadia100.jpg height=100 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> DAOC - no exp for rezzing</span><hr size=1> not sure if you are aware of this but rezzing in DAOC doesnt give you extra experience back<br>

you lose 50pct exp from death and 50pct from release<br>

I, for one, a former bard and cleric in EQ who loved randomly helping people, play a scout. I'm fairly pressed when it comes to offering my assistance. I guide people to and from their destination if I'm asked, and if con nearly every person I run by who's in combat, and if it looks close, draw critical, and wait to see if I need to fire. On a few occaisions, I've nailed a mob that was chasing someone who was near death. Sadly, I've never actually been thanked for this, but at the same time, I don't think a lot of people even notice. Then again, if some mob was handing me my arse and it suddenly went from 75% health to dead inside of a second, I'd scroll back to see who just saved me so I could say thanks...<br>

<br>
1)  Server overcrowding.  There was a period where a group would camp single mobs in LGuk and SolB during peak on some servers.  This is insane.  Overcrowding in any sort of animal leads to anti-social behavior which over time became ingrained behavior on production servers.<br>
<br>
2) Player vs Verant.  There became an atmosphere of players against Verant for a significant portion of the population.  (significant &lt;&gt; majority by the way).  There appeared to be enough frustration against nerfs that since players couldn't take it out on Verant (until DAoC anyway) that they took it out on each other.  This leads to less friendly behavior toward strangers...no rocket science here, if you're pissed off you tend to be less helpful.<br>
<br>
I don't see 1 in DAoC but then again I'm on one of the smaller servers.  So far folks are helpful for the most part except in some overcrowded dungeons.  I can't tell if its bad play or folks being anti-social in there...but I've seen folks attempting to pull THROUGH another group (er, no kidding, the mob stops and smacks a sitting caster). <br>
<br>
Two is a viable possibility...with the idiotic nerfs that Mythic has put out there's a building resentment against Mythic.  One they better learn to manage quickly because changes to help players are about ten times less effective in managing frustration as nerfs help to build frustration.  <br>
<br>
I have zero clue what the big assed deal about crafting was that it needed a nerf but it's pretty damned stupid.  Same for the xp nerf for groups.  That was a collosal mistake...one they may pay for heavily.  <br>
<br>
Nerfs are the single most destructive thing you can do to a game...it is completely without any justification whatsoever.<br>
<br>
To solve the archer problem you add more shields spells in the game.  If you're dumb enough to run without them you should get whacked and easy too.  You can start with just damage reduction anti-arrow shields (good for one shot) rather than negating the first hit if you want.  Give it to all healer base classes or something.<br>
<br>
The solution to crafting being too profitable is to introduce more luxury items.  There was zero need to solve the problem of PLing among groups below 30.  Above 30 the rate of growth seemed pretty damn slow regardless of what you do.<br>
<br>
There are ways to solve problems without either nerfs or runaway power inflation.<br>

What the hell is up with people who can't seem to fathom the idea of starting over. That's what always pissed me off about EQ: Verant's catering to the top (excessively whiney) 1% of gamers, so they have something to do.<br>
<br>
How about this: &quot;You beat the game, shutup.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seriously, so you played to 40. Woohoo... RvR isn't always boring or tired, and yes, PvE is realtively limited at that level, but have you even fathomed starting a new character? There's what, 30 classes? You've played 1 to about 80% of its level max, and you're whining that there's nothing left to do? You've seen NOTHING that this game has to offer.<br>
