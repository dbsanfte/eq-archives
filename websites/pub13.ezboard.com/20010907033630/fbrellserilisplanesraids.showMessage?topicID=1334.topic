<br>
Note, this is not the actual vote thread.  Please read the thread completely for more information.<br>
<br>
After reviewing the posts (found here:<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1301.topic">pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1301.topic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->) please make an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  educated</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> decision about how to abolish the intentions board.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Problem</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
The problem is as follows:<br>
<br>
With the maturing of the server, the board we have known as the intentions board has been changed in meaning.  For some, the board is a way to gather people for raiding or to look for raiding opportunities.  For others however, the board has become a way to declare an intention upon an area; one, in fact, that cannot be encroached upon.  This mentality has led to intention becoming a &quot;pusedo-reservation&quot;, one in which that goes against the idea of &quot;intentions&quot; and infringes on the uniqueness of reservations versus intentions.<br>
<br>
Because of these differing mentalities, clashes between both guilds and individuals have arisen, stemming from a simple misunderstanding of what intentions are.  The key thing to remember is that intentions are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> meant to be reservations.  With this in mind, the best way to fix the misinterpretation of intentions is to remove &quot;intentions&quot; from our mindset so they are not confused with reservations.  (Note: this is more clearly explained in the thread above)<br>
<br>
The problem, therefore, is figuring out how to deal with the intentions board and accounting for the loss of raiding-support resources that the population would experience when the board is gone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Proposal</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
The proposed solutions are as follows:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  1 -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Remove the intentions board and replace it with a general &quot;reservation&quot; board.<br>
<br>
Because the intentions board has become a way of unoffically reserving mobs/zones, they should be made offical, thus removing the confusion of &quot;respecting pusedo-reservations&quot;.  Also, since they encompassed all non-reserved areas, the board would encompass all areas that specifically don't have rotations or other rules set for them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2 -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Remove the intentions board and leave other zones as first come, first serve.<br>
<br>
Because the intentions board has become, a way of reserving zones that were not meant to be reserved, they should be totally removed to remove the confusion of &quot;respecting pusedo-reservations&quot;.  Areas not covered by reservation rules would be first come, first serve-ffa.  Specific areas can be proposed and voted on to be reserved.<br>
<br>
If you vote for number two, there is a second issue that needs to be voted on as well:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2a -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Replace the intentions board with a &quot;recruiting&quot; board<br>
<br>
Because the intentions board served as a forum to gather raid support, a valuable resource for Brell Serilis, a board that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  clearly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> serves that purpose should be made.  A point will be made that the board, in no way, shape, or form, counts as intentions OR reservations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  2b -</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Replace the intentions board with nothing<br>
<br>
Because the addition of a &quot;recruiting&quot; forum may cause the same conflict that having an intentions board caused, such a board should not be made.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Vote information</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The vote for this particular topic will take place on one day in a (roughly) 24 hour time frame.  This is to ensure that those that are passionate about the subject will vote, and ensure that a &quot;count till we win&quot; situation will be avoided.<br>
<br>
The Vote thread (Voting: Abolishment of the Intentions Board) will be made at approximately 12:00 am PST, Saturday the 10th of February.  The polls will close at 5:00 pm PST, Sunday, the 11th of Februrary.  <br>
<br>
Once the thread is opened, votes may be posted by posting &quot;I vote for&quot; followed by the option you chose (1, 2a, 2b in this particular vote).  Extended messages will be discarded and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  may be ignored if the vote is not easily readable</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Extended discussion in the vote <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  will NOT be tolerated and may result in your vote being deleted</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
At 5:00 pm PST of the 11th, the thread will be locked and the votes will be carefully tallied.  IP adresses will be checked and if there are any discrepencies, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  the said IP adresses will be banned</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  After the tally is finished and checked, the outcome will be immediately put into effect.<br>

Cart - The option that best keeps the spirit of the intentions board as it is now is the first option.  With that mindset, intentions are to be respected, thus leading to reservations.  The removal of the board in order to create a general &quot;reservation&quot; board only makes the point clear that such intentions are indeed reservations and are not subjective in respecting.<br>

Hmm.  Then none of these are no change.  I don't want to turn all intentions into full reservations, and I don't want to remove all intentions and leave no room for guilds to coordinate.<br>
<br>
Couldn't we just simply the proposal to a yes/no should intentions be replaced with a recruiting forum?  This makes the butterfly ballot look simple <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Cart, I have read through your posts and I don't understand why you want it intentions to be &quot;observed&quot; yet isn't that what number 1 is addressing (semantics really when you get down to using the word &quot;reservation&quot; in place of &quot;observed&quot;)?   We need to call it like it is.  If people expect to have intentions observed, it is in fact a reservation because the insults and rants are NO different when either are stepped on.<br>

My issue is this:<br>
<br>
I think that _SOME_ intentions should be respected.  Others perhaps are just bogus. The question is size and scope of effort.   <br>
<br>
Clearly there are certain places where the friction is occuring that drives Goat and others to make these proposals. (If they weren't catching grief about stepping on intentions, there would be no impetus to debate this at all)<br>
<br>
Squashing the intentions board won't change these points of friction, because people getting stepped on are going to complain whether they have an intention forum or not.  It will make those stepping on the intentions feel more justified in doing so, and I think just harden the lines between larger guilds and smaller ones.<br>
<br>
Conversely, I don't want to turn intentions into reservations because it may cure the disease while killing the patient.  I'm not an advocate of turning the whole server into a reservation system.  Reservations were designed to prevent friction over popular zones.  So where is the friction that is driving this proposal?<br>
<br>
I want specific examples of the friction points so we can see what to do about them. is it POG?  is it Phinny? is it really Derv camp #3? After that, I'm comfortable changing, because I'd feel that the root cause of the friction had been addressed. (obviously PoG is one, since it is getting debated in a separate thread)<br>
<br>
I think the proposal is an easy way to avoid the issue of debating the areas of friction and how to fix it, but it won't in fact help.<br>
<br>
And the alternative I'm offered is to make everything reservable which I haven't heard anyone support, certainly I don't.<br>
<br>
Given that, I vote no change because either option either worsens the situation, or doesn't address the problem.<br>
<br>
Clearer, I hope.<br>
<br>

A disclaimer is not the solution.  We've had a disclaimer for a while now and apparently nobody reads or abides by it.<br>
<br>
I'd like to vote for option #1 but right now it's just a huge grey area.  In order to vote for it I'd need:<br>
<br>
1) A list of specific reservable places.<br>
2) Rules for each regarding how long a block is to be reserved and how long before a raid starts must be left for respawn.<br>
3) A format for posting your reservation (name of zone, date, time, time zone, raid leader ).<br>
4) A limit on how far reservations can be made in advance.<br>
5) A method for resolving conflicts when they arise.<br>
6) Whatever else I missed that someone else wants to point out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Intentions are not reservations.  If we change the name of the board, remove the board, or eliminate the board, the problem to eshew will persist.  People will still complain about encroaching on recruitment efforts.  People will still find a way to make their intentions known on bs.net.

<br>
If a person or group of persons can not understand that intentions are intentions and not reservations, the problem is with them, not everyone else.  If a person makes the intention of camping the efreeti and someone else is already there when they go to Sol, too bad.  If that same person then comes here to rant, so be it, they are an idiot and should get as much attention as any other idiot would get.<br>
<br>
That being said, I have always felt that Phinny (NOT KEDGE) should be a reservation.  I think most of this started with the discussion regarding Phinny.  If this is the case, it's a bit of an overkill to abolish the intentions board over a specific issue.  Perhaps the issue that should be voted on is whether or not Phinny should be a reserveable Mob.<br>

Everything has repercussions, and if the continued ranting about how you posted an intention that was then later ignored or not honored causes you to make an argument based on NOTHING, then too bad the boards that are being abused and being used to abuse other players for simply playing should be removed.<br>
<br>
If you haven't guessed it, I support removing the intentions board.<br>
<br>
If it's not reserved in a specific forum for a specific reason or through general consensus, it should be First Come First Served.<br>

There are issues and we need to deal with them.  Cart, I see your point but it is better to go with a 2a option and then that list of what you think should be reservable..like what Kruunch has up?  I have no issue with making those reservable, especially if it is going to solve this issue with intentions and rants about it.  So having a no change is NOT fixing the issue and there IS an issue whether people want to be ignorant about it or not.<br>
<br>
Let's go with 2a and make those special things reservable.  I'm sick and tired of people moving that the efreeti and other silly spawns are reservable.  The list Kruunch has up, makes sense.  <br>

The intentions vote might go a little better if this were done.  When voting reservables on a list, it is good to do a line item vote.<br>
<br>
Goat I think this will be adopted a little better if places that take major effort in terms of getting people together, were actually reservable.  As for the window of one day, there are probably a lot of ppl that won't be able to make it and might not be too happy.  A window of 4 or 5 days might be more appropriate yet short enough.<br>
<br>
In the end, if you want a board like this (where only 2% of the ppl come btw) to be taken seriously, buy in is extremely important to the survival of it.  So please, consider what it takes to get buy in regardless of how you feel about it.  This board could become extinct if it doesn't.<br>

<br>
an INTENTION is:<br>
<br>
On Sunday the 10th I intend on going to dinner with my wife.<br>
<br>
a RESERVATION is:<br>
<br>
On Sunday the 10th at 5:00pm my Wife and I are going to A_Swanky_Restaurant_00 for dinner. I have placed the reservations, and set the time.<br>
<br>
The intentions board (if it is TRUELY intentions) would not allow times. Only dates. Therefore, by allowing people to post:<br>
<br>
South Karana: Sunday 11/2/2001 12:45 EST<br>
That's right on Sunday 11/2/2001 at 12:45 EST me and my friends claim all spawns in South Karana until about 12:45AM EST Sunday 12/2/2001. We are farming the crap outta that place.<br>
<br>
Really, that INTENTION could be made under the current system, and someone point to it saying &quot;but we posted our intentions&quot; to kick people out of the spawns they wanted...<br>
<br>
Ok, perhaps a bit out of there, and a bit on the ludicruos side, but it's really JUST a zone, and 6 people 50+ should be able to handle it, so I guess it's not reserveable, like Kedge Keep.. <br>
<br>
Now before someone says something about &quot;tradition&quot; or &quot;But Phinny is part of an epic&quot; I did not pick South Karana lightly. South Karana has a epic spawn as well, and honestly they are just 2 zones. <br>
<br>
The point I guess I am trying to make is when you define something as an intention, it should be vague. I'll be there Monday. So that when Happy_Guild_00 looks they see another guild intends on being in there on Monday, and the raid leaders can *gasp* talk, work out a &quot;Well kill Phinny by noon, so he should be up by 8 that night....&quot; or whatever...<br>
<br>
Personally, I think some things might need to be placed on FCFS basis, other things NEED to remain reserveable.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of new people hitting 46+, which means a HUGE influx of planar-capable people. So to keep the rotations of people going to the planes, we need to reserve. As new areas open up that people want to hit, they should be evaluated, not for the &quot;current level&quot; but for the &quot;appropriate level&quot;.<br>
<br>
Sure 3 60's could take the Fire Giants, but does that mean that they should not be reserveable for the 40-50 crowd that likes raiding?<br>
<br>
Sure, my mind (and thus my topics) tend to wander whilst I type. But the points are valid.  <p><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=1323">Valeer Shadowsbaine Reaver of the 51st Season</A> <br>
