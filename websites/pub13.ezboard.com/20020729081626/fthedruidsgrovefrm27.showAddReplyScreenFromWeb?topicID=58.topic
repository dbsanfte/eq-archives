Landstrom, <br>
<br>
>>>>Mark's silence on this matter seems to confirm my suspicions that <br>
we are screwed during the first few weeks. <br>
<br>
No, my silence on this issue was simply that gee, I don't know, maybe I <br>
hadn't had time to read the boards after I left the office at 6PM <br>
yesterday. Wow, what a concept. I'm in the office now and I'm going to <br>
answer your foolish charges. <br>
<br>
>>>>I just wish he was honest enough to admit it rather than give us <br>
the PR "we're all prepared line." <br>
<br>
If you have been paying attention to my posts over the last year here, <br>
you would already know I don't spin things. When we screw up, I've <br>
apologized to the users (as in the double billing) and taken care of it. <br>
<br>
>>>>Of all people, a Verant employee posted the rationale behind <br>
deliberately overloading the servers. <br>
<br>
That was their rationale. We won't overload the servers on purpose <br>
except during the beta test. I won't dispute what Verant said as to why <br>
they did it but we are not Verant. I will say that server infrastructure is <br>
not horrifically expensive though, my top two costs are bandwidth and <br>
customer service. The cost of servers is very reasonable compared to <br>
them. <br>
<br>
>>>>Fine. That makes a lot of sense to me. I understand that we are <br>
screwed the first few weeks, and I accept it. <br>
<br>
Accept it for Verant if you want, not for Mythic. Keep in mind that <br>
Verant also did thay because they had no idea how big of a hit they had <br>
on their hands. They were caught by surprise, a good surprise but by <br>
surprise. <br>
<br>
Now, as to your previous letter. <br>
<br>
>>>>You said previously that you were working with a 60K figure. <br>
<br>
Correct, that is what we expected that the game would sell in the first <br>
week. However, all our internal estimates were still based on 100K total <br>
subscribers at launch. In other words, we thought we were <br>
over-prepared at launch. Now, even VU doesn't expect us to sell more <br>
than 70% of those copies the first week which would leave us at 70K <br>
customers which is still under the 100K subscribers. <br>
<br>
>>>>Of course, you may well consider opening week different from "the <br>
launch phase." <br>
<br>
I do. Launch phase is really the first month of the game. <br>
<br>
>>>>* "'Capacity per server?' 1000 people per realm, 3000 per world." <br>
<br>
Correct, 10 Worlds x 3K = 30K simultaneous players our of a player base <br>
of 100K. <br>
<br>
<br>
>>>>Given your previous statements about a 2:1 ratio, you would need <br>
to have enough Worlds for 50K simulateous users. <br>
<br>
No, the 2:1 ratio will only occur during the first week at best. The <br>
general ratio is closer to 3:1 at peak. <br>
<br>
>>>>Unfortunately, you based your assumptions about simultaneous <br>
players, among other things, on EQ, which has a worldwide player-base. <br>
<br>
<br>
Not true, we based our assumptions of 16 years watching these kind of <br>
games. Additionally, given the time zones even in this country, there will <br>
be a difference. <br>
<br>
>>>>Moreover, as you know, the first few days will see MUCH more <br>
traffic than is typical for EQ (much like EQ did after Kunark or, to a much <br>
lesser extent, Velious). <br>
<br>
Totally true. That's why we will have 10 servers. <br>
<br>
>>>>If you have sold 100K copies, I fully expect the number of users <br>
wanting to log on the first night to be in the 60-75K range. <br>
<br>
I won't agree that we will sell 75K the first night. None of our retailers <br>
expect that to happen. The first week, that's a possibility but that <br>
percentage of sell through would make it one of the top selling PC <br>
games of the year. My 60K is more reasonable. <br>
<br>
<br>
>>>>That's about 200-250 percent of your current capacity. <br>
<br>
No, it's not. You will never have a 1:1 ratio in any large numbers. In <br>
order to do this everybody would have to buy the game at the same <br>
time and immediately go home and play it. We will see a surge of use <br>
the first week but with the time zone problem, 1:1 in any quantity is <br>
unheared of for these types of games. I've been in the industry for quite <br>
a while and have talked to most of the main folks at these companies <br>
over the years and there is no data to support your claim. <br>
<br>
<br>
>>>>I may well be wrong, and I understand you don't have the luxury of <br>
"guessing" like I do. <br>
<br>
You will be. <br>
<br>
>>>>Perhaps we can just agree that it will be crowded. <br>
<br>
I hope not. <br>
<br>
>>>>What happens if I log on the first night and all the Worlds are full? <br>
Will the server still let me log on or will I get a "Please try again later" <br>
message? <br>
<br>
We can go over the limit on the servers. In some of my previous posts I <br>
had talked about the fact that our Worlds can support more than 3000 if <br>
we need them to. Since you are fond of numbers, let's play with some: <br>
<br>
1) Total ideal launch capacity : 30K <br>
2) Total units sold week 1 80K <br>
3) Total max simultaneous player: 40K <br>
<br>
Total Shortfall 10K <br>
<br>
To deal with this we already have two contingency plans: <br>
<br>
Plan #1 - Increase server capacity by 15%. <br>
<br>
Based on our numbers that would take care of 4500 of those users. <br>
<br>
Plan#2 - If Plan#1 doesn't take care of enough users, expand number of <br>
Worlds with excess capacity from our World setup. <br>
<br>
In laying out the architecture for DAoC we added a 4th machine which is <br>
there simply to handle the dungeons. Given the fact that the dungeons <br>
are not designed for new players to explore, these machines can be <br>
pulled from each World and used to create a new World. Doing so would <br>
yield 2 more Worlds which would yield an extra 6K simultaneous subs. <br>
Problem solved. BTW, if people do level up quickly and get into the <br>
dungeons they will still run of course but they would run on the Realm's <br>
box instead of a separate one. No real effect on gameplay unless <br>
players immediately level up to 30 and get hundreds organized from each <br>
side and immediately go into Realm wars the first night. If that happens, <br>
we have much bigger problems. <br>
<br>
>>>>2) Your numbers appear to assume an even split among the realms. <br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, and from what we've seen, that's pretty accurate. <br>
<br>
>>>>Suppose 50 percent of the players want to play Albion , with the <br>
other 50 percent splitting between Midgard and Hibernia. <br>
<br>
The player would have to go to another World. <br>
<br>
>>>>Will the server allow the realms to be unbalanced (the 3,000 player <br>
per World limit)? <br>
<br>
No. <br>
<br>
3) When the new Worlds go live, will players be able to transfer their <br>
characters or will they be expected to start anew? (Personally, I'd <br>
PREFER starting anew.) <br>
<br>
Anew. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
>>>>I just wish that Mark Jacobs had not "out Veranted" Verant on this <br>
one. <br>
<br>
Get your facts straight before you make an accusation like this next <br>
time. Also, when you post a message at 9:30 EST time and don't even <br>
wait a full 24 hours (or more on weekend, especially at this stage of <br>
launch) you make yourself look like a troll or worse. Show me any other <br>
company President who less than 3 days before launch takes the time <br>
on a Sunday to talk to the customers. There are some I'm sure but we <br>
are not in the majority. <br>

<br>
>>>>Amazon.com makes it seem like it was poor planning on Mythic's <br>
part. In some small part it was. <br>
<br>
Untrue, totally untrue. VU's sales folks busted their butt talking to the <br>
buyers from the various companies. Amazon and others were contacted <br>
and they placed their orders. Based on the orders that were receved <br>
weeks ago, VU and Mythic confirmed our plans. Now buyers want more <br>
but it is less than a week before launch. How is this in any way our or <br>
VU's fault? <br>
<br>
Additionally, it really isn't anyone's fault. The buyers from the various <br>
retailers have years of experience in these matters and base their <br>
numbers on things like previous titles in the genre, previous titles from <br>
the developer, etc. Based on that, they made the right move even if it <br>
didn't work out. <br>

<br>
1/2 of the guys bitch was because they decided NOT to sell more copies.  They printed 100k copies, and planned their initial hardware based on that.  Then the software companies asked for more copies and they said no.<br>
<br>
They could have printed more cd's in time to be sold.  Made more money, and annoyed more people.  They couldn't get the servers to handle it, so they decided to force people to wait a week.<br>
<br>
But now the trouble is that they might sell nearly all the copies initially printed (they expected some not to be sold).  This could cause some troubles.  but not much<br>
<br>
being on beta 4.  They overdid the server by a bit, and it was very playable.  They had 40,000 people able to log onto one server.  So at that rate, they could handle all 100k possible people on 3 servers and they have 10.  So it should be fine.  <br>
