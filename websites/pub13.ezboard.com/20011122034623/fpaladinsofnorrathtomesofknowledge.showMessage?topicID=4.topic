--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 I know most tanks now feel that ac is king, my theory is sometimes yes and sometimes no. I think AC is king when in a group but stat items may be as important when soloing. A great test is find a tough npc guard such as in fp. I did this and it was a tough blue guard. I got my AC up to 810, about 70 more AC then when I have my stat items on. I then melee the guard and see how much dmg i can do before I am forced to zone out or LOH's to beat him. I did this several times as I was working bind wound also, I found I had to zone out FASTER with all that AC stuff on, I am talking steel mask, steel collar, gold topaz earrings etc verses plat sapphire necklace, plat ruby vail etc. My str went from 160ish down to 120 or so and i could not dmg the guard enough. I also tried different weapons, Sprinkler, GB, Yak, SF and Mithril 2 hander. Only the mithril 2 hander seemed to do any major dmg before I had to zone. Now I am several levels higher and can keep my AC over 800 and still have 166 str. So I tend to have a balance, I still tank better then most others I group with cause I do more dmg and thus angry the mobs more. I think AC help more when being hit from behind like when in a group, but when trying to melee a tough mob head to head I notice hitting him back helps also. Try it out, I was sparring with guard Lendl I think is his name, he is level 37 or so. I can beat him now with root and heals unless he is duel wielding, then I need heals and lohs to beat him solo.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I believe there is a certain magic AC number for different mobs. Once I got my AC above 800 vs kobolds, I started demolishing them. We are talking one bubble lost per fight on average. Interestingly, my self-buffed AC is now at 920, and the difference isn't that noticable. But if I drop my AC to around 750, I start losing 2 or 3 bubbles when soloing.<br>
<br>
I haven't done any parsing in quite a while, but when I did parse, most of it was vs kobolds and froglock zol knights. And my soloing ability increased dramatically from 750ish AC to 800ish AC.<br>
<br>
In none of my tests have I noticed an accuracy difference with higher and lower strength. I did notice a damage difference of roughly 5% when I went from 120 STR to 170STR. I have heard rumors that you notice much bigger gains with super high STR. Perhaps there is a magic STR number vs certain mobs, I don't know.<br>
<br>
AGI is something else I am unsure about. Many claim that it only adds to the total AC number. I am still considering the possibility that it increases damage avoidance, while raw AC from armor increases damage mitigation. Consider (purely hypothetical):<br>
<br>
Increasing AC by 50pts enables you to absorb 20% more damage.<br>
<br>
Increasing AGI by 50pts makes you avoid hits 5% more often.<br>
<br>
The reason that it is seen that pure AC is more important is that raising your AC by 50pts is easier than raising your AGI by 50pts. And since you take less overall damage while increasing your AC by the same amount as AGI, it is viewed that AC is much more important than AGI.<br>
<br>
While I agree that AC is much more important than AGI (tests have shown this), maybe it is not so in all cases. For instance, while fighting a mob with incredible ATK such as Lord Nagafen, I seem to get hit for max damage no matter what my AC is. If I raise my AC by 50 pts, Nagafen is still mashing me like I have no armor on at all. But if I increase my AGI by 50 pts, would I dodge hits better? I would think the answer would be yes.<br>
<br>
I haven't done any parsing, but I am still not convinced that AGI is worthless. In some cases, it may be better to have high AGI rather than high AC. I still concede that in 99% of fights, high AC is better than high AGI.<br>
<br>
Which bracer would be better for overall tanking?<br>
<br>
AC8 AGI+12<br>
AC11<br>
<br>
When equipped, the AC11 bracer gives more total AC. But will you in fact take less damage with the AC8 AGI+12 bracer? If we are comparing a serp bracer vs a silver plated bracer, it would be:<br>
<br>
AC1 AGI+9<br>
AC7<br>
<br>
In this case, I think that the AC7 bracer is far better. We are looking at 6AC vs 9AGI. Whereas, in the previous case we are looking at 3AC vs 12AGI.<br>
<br>
I'm not claiming that AGI has been overlooked. My current equip gives me fairly high AC (920) with fairly low AGI (84), and am pretty happy with it. But I am still considering the true differences between pure AC on items and AGI.<br>

Well, your data seems at best anecdotal.<br>
<br>
There is also a serious logical flaw with your story.<br>
<br>
&quot;I found I had to zone out FASTER with all that AC stuff on&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
This is impossible.<br>
<br>
<br>
With your stats gear on at BEST you would hope for is to zone having taken the SAME amount of damage but having inflicted more damage to the guard in the same time.<br>
<br>
Your statement implies you take LESS damage with LESS AC.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Well if I have to zone out having done less dmg to the guard then yes I am taking MORE dmg. The entire point is to balance offense with defense, if by wearing all ac items in place of stat boosting items (ie str, agility, dext, stamina, even wis), I am losing combat effectiveness, I think I would have to think long and hard before I replace my platinum ruby vail with a dented brass mask, or my golden black pearl choker with a runed lava pendant. I have been in situations where my warrior in full crafted does not seem to take hits any better then one in full bronze. My Paladin has 101 agility I just don't like going below that for some reason. <br>
<br>
I add up the total usefulness of the item I am equiping, to me 7 str and 7 wis beats 4 ac and 3 str hands down. 7 agility and 7 dext beats 5 ac and 6 str. <br>
I may be losing some AC but I have more mana, I hit harder, I get encumbered less frequently which leads to getting hit harder then more AC would, or you don't loot and end up poor and il equiped. I have equiped golden topaz earrings and it did not help so I went back to electrum sapphire earrings. I think where AC and stats go hand in hand like on plane armor I can get plenty of AC that way without spending insane amounts of plat on items like diamondmine earrings and runed lava pendaints. When I am in a group I tank with the best of them and I hit back HARD all the time, cause I won't add a few AC points here and there and lose 40 or 50 str in the process. If you get your str high enough you WILL notice a major difference in average dmg per hit. I would prefer to hit for 45 to 55 average with a sprinkler with 165 str instead of 35 to 50 with 100 str.<br>
<br>
My stats are as of level 51 with my most common equipment, 165 str, 89 stamina, 117 dext, 101 agility, 100 wis, 825 AC. My post 50 boosts are just starting to go up.<br>
<br>
I think being pounded on is only part of our job, hitting back and doing our share of the dmg is very important. I am sure we have all had episodes where a mob seams to be totally bloodthirsty and hits you for max dmg as if you had zero armor on, all the armor in the world won't help. And other times it is like you can tank the GL all night, so to me it is more in the random number generator then in pure AC points.<br>
<br>
Just try sparring with that guard with all your ac and 100 str and see what happens, then try it with a bunch of str and stat items on and see which way works better for you.<br>
<br>
Oh and I have done romps going back a long time and I can tell you I tried extra ac on greens and they hit the same if not harder go figure, maybe it was because with lousy stats you give them more TIME to hit you and thus take more dmg.<br>
<br>
I think my bottom line is I will not switch to DW from valorium unless the new item has as good of stat boosters.<br>

You would give up countless amounts of AC to hit for 5 - 10 more damage? Count up all of the AC you are giving up for that 5 - 10 extra damage. Although small amounts here and there, it really adds up. You proved Belds point to me in your wording. Giving up all of that extra Ac for 65 str, while it looks nice, isnt worth 5 - 10 extra damage IMO. To me all that would do, is make you a mana sponge for the cleric since things will be smaking you around so much hehe. <br>

The MoBs of RoK will own you if your AC is not at least 900 or above. The clerics will say something like &quot;Gets some AC Im just about OOM&quot; My AC is just over 900 without a shield and can be as high as 920ish. I notice a decrease in damage when i equip the shield but the Ornate Rune Blade has 5ac on so I dont feel so bad going two handed. <br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>

You seem to have misunderstood Beld.<br>
<br>
You claim that you had to zone out FASTER when you had higher AC. Since you zoned and did not kill the guard, this would mean that you are taking more damage with higher AC, not that you are DOING less damage.<br>
<br>
Also, several of us have tested stats and their effect on damage &amp; accuracy using logs of fights and found that no statistic influences accuracy (which was later confirmed by Verant) and that strength only slightly influences damage output at high levels.<br>
<br>
Some folks on the monk boards tested AC vs. agility and found that agility did not affect dodging OR misses (more than the addition of the same amount of AC granted by that agility increase would). In other words, if 24 agility grants you 4 AC, you'd get the same effect from just adding an item that yields 4 AC.<br>
<br>
This stuff has been tested by paladins, monks, shaman, rangers, warriors and shadowknights - independent tests using a wide range of methods. The converging evidence was always the same - stats have only a marginal effect on performance, AC has a significant effect.<br>
<br>
The problem is this: prior to all the testing using logs &amp; log parsers, people were doing the things you are doing. You have a pre-conceived hypothesis and you use your perception of how the fight went (e.g., number of bubbles, how fast you had to zone, etc.) to draw your conclusions. When you are using observational data like that you -will- fall prey to the &quot;confirmation bias.&quot; Even when using &quot;objective&quot; data, it's a dangerous thing, but when just juding from your experience, it's &quot;deadly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me say that when I started testing, I honestly believed that stats made a difference. I thought I became more accurate when I put on my silver fire emerald rings. I thought I was doing significantly more damage (after all, I was seeing bigger numbers) when I was wearing my strength stuff. When I did start testing, I thought the data had to be wrong. It took several tests with different equipment vs. different mobs before I was willing to present my data (originally it was here and on the deceased eq.stratics paladin forum). A lot of people thought I was crazy, but others started testing too and found the same thing. Then Gordon put his foot in his mouth by admitting to a lot of it (and then saying they wouldn't tell us anymore because it &quot;ruins the mystery&quot;).<br>
<br>
If you want to wear stats stuff, that's your business - if it makes you happy and you're having fun, that's fine. However, the vast majority of data is against those beliefs. Some folks still really believe that the world is flat and it makes them happy to believe it. *shrug*<br>

get such high AC. At level 51 with 3 DW pieces<br>
my self-buffed AC is around 860 or 870 (and yes<br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Ok, up until this post I have always heard on this board that adding strength ONLY raises your max damage, not your average damage. So which is correct?<br>
<br>
Personally, even if str adds to your average dmg also, I will still stick happily with all of my AC gear. You have to face it sometime that in EQ we are meant to take the hits, not really anything else. We do just enough damage, throw stuns, etc.. so we can taunt it off of the casters that lay down more damage in one spell than we will the whole fight.<br>
<br>
I'm always happy to recieve shaman stat buffs, but I would never sacrifice AC for any stat. As for the encumberance issue, hahaha. I run around with 89 str. Get some weight reducing bags.<br>

STR does increase maximum damage and *therefore*<br>
it increases average damage. However the effect<br>
on average damage is *extremely* small (a few<br>
percents for a +100 STR buff, with most formulae),<br>
which means for most purposes you can ignore the<br>
effect of STR on your damage output.<br>

&quot;Well if I have to zone out having done less dmg to the guard then yes I am taking MORE dmg.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
This sentense makes no sense at all. How much damage you do to the guard has NOTHING to do with the amount of damage you take.<br>
<br>
When everyone switched to AC, I remember many many posts in which people could suddenly solo mobs they had never been able to solo before.<br>
<br>
I am sure at some point when fighting a particular mob there is AC overkill. A skeleton is going to miss you 9/10 times whether your ac is 800 or 900.<br>
<br>
With most blues however, especially in Kunark, you will not reach an AC plateau. At 51 all freeport guards are green except the uber guards that hit for 200+.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the necessity of AC is powerfully made clear by the huge problems rangers have in Kunark tanking. Their AC problems are causing many of them to quit and a huge uproar in the ranger community. I think this alone proves how important ac is.<br>
<br>
I advise everyone to continue to get the highest AC possible unless you are simply not being attacked by the mobs. <br>

Sorry I should have been clearer.<br>
<br>
When I said average damage I meant the mean damage number. The peak you get when you parse your data thats about in the middle of the spread. I realize raising max will effect your total average, but it effects it so little it's a joke.<br>
<br>
So, does raising strength increase only your max, or does it increase the mean damage too?<br>

I think what the original poster is trying to say is that Having a higher average damage, he will have a shorter fight, so having the higher AC isn't as important, as he will kill the mob quicker, and so not need the staying power the AC gives.<br>
<br>
You'd be right if: The higher Str gave you a corrisponding increase is damage somewhere close to the amount of more damage you can take from having a higher AC. I don't think it does but you might want to check it on your own.<br>

Logged data has shown that *yes* more STR means you are doing more Max Damage. But if you look at the theoretical 1 Hand Slashing and 2 Hand Slashing damage formulas, you'll note that you hit your Magic Number(MN) and Min Damage far and away more than your Max Damage. MN is independant of the weilder(ie. a Troll SK, a High Elf Paladin, and a Halfing Druid...doesn't matter what they are MN is the same for the weapon) and stats. Min Damage is as well.<br>
<br>
So the point is that increasing your STR will increase your Max Damage, but it neglegably increases your Average Damage(IIRC, we are talking about .1s increase in damage per round for uber STR gear). Especialy if you are sacraficing AC for STR items, you are really putting yourself at a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
STR however is the only stat that has a clearly defined side advantage...it allows you to carry more weight. This is a far better effect than increasing your Max Damage it seems. ^_^;<br>
<br>
ps. I find it a rediculous assertion that &quot;AC gear is bad because I had to run away.&quot; If you had stat gear on, you'd run away even faster. ^_^;<br>

its all the same really... most of the time I let the higher level warrior in the group tank since they're better at the job than I am and a lot more mana efficient for the cleric to do so with 1200+ ac and 4000+ ac and defensive..<br>
Therefore I try to maximize my dmg even though higher str doesn't mean that much, every little bit still helps.<br>
<br>
However, if I'm the main tank, I would try to get as much hp/ac as possible but either way, most of the time I just run around with HP equipment. <br>
<br>
However, from what I've seen, AC only matters every interval of 50 meaning any number rom 951 -999 won't make that much difference as opposed to 1000 ac. <br>
<br>
Well anyways, that's that..  <br>

 Some of you can't read, I said AC is important in groups, I said stats may be just as important when soloing. Because in a group one usually has a druid, shaman or even a ranger to buff str and stuff. And since us Paladins are not as damaging as any other melee class, we have to have the str to do as much dmg as we can, we usually have slower weapons and more str helps for max dmg and average dmg, trust me. I was using soulfire the other day at the fear portal assisting some folks in a cr, I had 199 str with a druid buff and was hitting for 80 to 100 regularly, then the buff wore off and the average dmg dropped a lot, maybe it was cause the stuff was green but I was hitting the necro the same. <br>
<br>
All you guys claim to have 900+ AC, I want to know how that is, the AC items I don't use that everyone always lists only add up to maybe 40 AC, such as diamonine earrings, runed lava pendant and dented brass mask, those are really the only ac items I don't wear that all the ac folks recommend. The earrings have 2 each, runed lava pendant has 5, dented mask has 4, how does 13 AC give you guys 75+ MORE ac THEN ME? I have a val chest, legs, arms, bracer, hero bracer, ro boots and gauntlets, skull barbute. So I certainly am not ditching AC for stats. I use a cracked darkwood shield with sprinkler, still trying for a trueheart shield. And if you are wearing all DW armor you probably have 100 str is my guess. Well if you think I can't tank with 825 AC you not too bright, I have tanked guardian wurms just fine, how does anyone tank that stuff cept for someone chain stunning, fear kiting, c healing etc, nobody sits and tanks 50+ mobs like you guys claim. Last time I checked kunark just came out a few months ago, so haveing 825 AC is fine by me, it will go up with my post 50 boosts whuch is probably how you guys have 900 + AC, you are level 55ish. When I want to go for max AC and tanking I pull out the plat fire wedding rings, otherwise I still use plat fire emerald most of the time.<br>
<br>
And I never claimed having less AC leads to less dmg other then the fact better stats helps you kill stuff faster, avoid getting hit at all etc. And more mana enables you to stun a mob a few extra times which helps the healer, every second a mob is stunned it is not hitting some guy with 60 wis and 1200 AC for 225, 225 ANYWAY. I want one of you with full DW to tell us what your stats are, str, sta, dext, agility, wis/int? Are you of any use to a group other then a moving AC kit? I think that is the warriors job, our job is a bit more flexible as Paladins. <br>
<br>
I await the next round of responses.<br>

It all comes down to the fact that Verant DID finally release what stats truly did, and it basically boiled down to that the higher your stats were, the faster your SKILLS went up, not that your existing skills were necessarily more effective.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have the post that Brad made about stats so we can end this stupid debate over stuff that has been hashed and re hashed over?<br>

 <br>
In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do.<br>
I'm going to post them here.<br>
<br>
This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds.<br>
<br>
That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others. <br>
<br>
We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here you go:<br>
<br>
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows<br>
<br>
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills<br>
<br>
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath<br>
<br>
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights<br>
<br>
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.<br>
<br>
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)<br>
<br>
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit<br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
well first of all im not going to put anyone down for their beliefs. What you belive is your business, and I can respect that. Just to give an example when using my mith 2 hander or GB I really dont notice anymore of a higher average dmg, or more then 4 or 5 points max dmg with storm str from a shaman. What I can tell you though is when I was lvl 39 i solo'd the WC guards for xp I always had a hard time solo'ing then. I then came here and became wise to the whole ac is king issue. I changed all my stats to ac and i noticed that i could solo them alot better. I was able to hang with them longer wich in turn gave me more time to do dmg and kill them. Where as before i had to use LoH quite a bit when my str was at 145 and dex was at 130. Now my str is at about 114 and dex is at about 90. But again i can solo alot better and clerics dont have to heal me as much. But what you believe is your business and no one has a right to push their beliefs on you. So if you feel that Higher Str and dex is over all better for you then more power to you and I will support you in your thoughts whether i agree with them or not  <br>

I honestly do not think that &quot;the higher your stats, the faster you learn skills&quot;. Your skills being learned are determined by your int. supposedly. I personally feel that they are just random rolls for when you get improvements.<br>
<br>
As far as melee damage. As said previously in this thread and in countless others: It only effects MAX damage, and minimally(sp?) effects average damage. From the posts of others on this board, it takes approx 10pts of str to equal 1pt of average damage and/or max damage increase. It does not help you hit more often what so ever(neither does Dex as some still think). That is determined by your skill in the weapon skill plus your lvl vs. the mobs, and the MOBs skill and its lvl vs. yours. I cant find the other one he made that gave more info on the other stats, but here is a post where Abashi &quot;Screwed up&quot; and posted something that he later denies, and tried to retract. He later said that he made a mistake in posting this, and some other (that i cannot find grr) info on stats. That those are supposed to be one of the &quot;mysteries&quot; of the game.<br>
Quote:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I give up, which one determines how often you hit?<br>
<br>
Neither. Only your level, offense, and weapons skill figures into the chance to hit.<br>
<br>
STR determines max damage and average damage. Higher STR will raise your damage cap, and will also increase your likelihood of hitting closer to your max. The exception to this is Archery, where Dex determines this.<br>
<br>
Dex determines how often a weapon will fire a random process, and also figures into critical hits for warriors. It also figures into some of the rogue skills.<br>
<br>
-Gordon<br>
<br>
As to why they would put this so called &quot;mystery&quot; info all of the sudden in some guide makes me curious. Could it possibly be to give more variety to the game? /shrug <br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Well I have 930 AC self buffed without a shield and the AC does help alot. I also have 133 str and 155 wisdom with my ac gear on so I have plenty of mana to heal and stun. <br>
<br>
Now we've all heard people say &quot;dude, I hit for 120 so often with a str buff with my soulfire&quot;. <br>
<br>
We all know the the number of hits over modal damage (magic number) is very small compared to the number of hits below it. Weve all seen eqparse histograms of people with 255 str and we all know str does VERY little to average damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
At some point we all thought stats did something big, but from months of log parsing its CLEAR that stats do very little.<br>
<br>
Now if you are in a group where you never get hit, the extra 3% damage you will do from 60 more str cant hurt. If you use, stun, however, mobs will agro on you and will be hit ALOT.<br>
<br>
I suggest the the original poster download eqparse like we all did six months ago and actually look at how often he hits for max or even above modal damage (magic number). It can be shocking the first time you see an eqparse histogram how few times you hit for max or even close to max with very high str.<br>
<br>
<br>
The truth is sometimes hard to come by, but its there if you look. <br>

Reply | Edit | Del here is my AC gear<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I have over 900 ac both when I equip my 2 hander and my shield. I have some good stuff in some areas and a few spots could use an upgrade. <br>
<br>
As far as ac gear-<br>
<br>
Head- DW Helm<br>
Neck- Collar undead protection<br>
Hand- DW guantlets<br>
face- Gangrenous Beetle Mask<br>
ears- Golden Topaz<br>
fingers- Jagged band/5 ac 55 ring or the 10ac -7 mr ring is there are no casters present.<br>
Shoulder- Tattered Mantle<br>
Back- Lizardscale Cloak<br>
Belt- Hangmans noose<br>
wrists- DW bracer/hero bracer<br>
Arms- valorium<br>
Chest- Black Enaml BP<br>
Legs- valorium<br>
Boots- DW boots<br>
<br>
1hander/shield- Gouldbane/Trueheart<br>
<br>
2hander- Nathsar Greatsword (alot of people think this sword sucks, but it is fast as hell and lets you get the 2hnder bonus more often- With my noose-25% haste- I can taunt anything off anyone not useing a COF or better)<br>
<br>
I have (self buffed) without my shield an AC in the 920's with the shield in the 950's.<br>
<br>
<br>
I use yaulp (and have been since I got it ) which adds to my ac/str--not factered in the above totals.<br>
<br>
I am a level 53 High elf paladin on Tarew Marr. With the DW armour my str is 102 and my wiz is 127. I have all the weight reducing boxes to compensate for the loss in str. <br>
<br>
I am very pleased with the DW armour (except the color, but it look cool in dark elf mode). I am able to tank very effectively in Sebilis and Karnor...something I could not do before I had all my DW.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.<br>

Warriors should also go all ac and hitpoints (even more than paladins). Make sure agility is over 75 and enough str not to be encumbered. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is my average equipment, tell me where I am flawed. And keep in mind I don't have a million plat to buy stuff like some of you must.<br>
<br>
Head: Skull Shaped Barbute for Magic Save, Exe hood most of the time<br>
Neck: Golden Black Pearl Choker<br>
Ears: Electrum Sapphire Earrings<br>
Face: Plat Ruby Vail for str, Plat Star Ruby Vail for dext<br>
Chest: Valorum Chest Plate <br>
Legs: Valorium Greaves<br>
Boots: Boots of Ro<br>
Hands: Gauntlets of Ro<br>
Wrists: Valorium Bracer and Hero Bracer<br>
Arms: Valorium Vambraces<br>
Waste: FBSS or Drakescale belt<br>
Fingers: Plat Fire Emerald Rings or Plat Fire Wedding rings for AC and hit points<br>
Range Slot: Runed Oak Bow<br>
Ammo: Magical Arrows (I make)<br>
Shield: Mistmoore for Dext, Cracked DW for str and higher AC<br>
<br>
Am I suppose to dump this stuff for all AC items and get a strawspun belt, dented mask, etc?<br>
<br>
I am wondering how having huge amounts of AC helps if you are not doing enough dmg to make the mob turn on you in the first place. That is my entire theory, do my share of the dmg and they will attack me and I don't HAVE to use stuns to piss them off, my weapon dmg pisses them off just fine. Some of you must think having full health at the end of each battle makes you a tank, I prefer to get hit and take dmg, that means I AM TANKING, not boring the mobs with my wimpy hits.<br>

Reply | Edit | Del This is all we are saying..<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is all that we are saying. You shouldnt give up AC for a stat as it doesnt make enough of a difference. Of course we all work on our stats to some degree. But if the choice is there between a stat, and some AC I would take the AC. On a few pieces of my gear I give up some AC for a stat, but I feel it is a even trade so i am content with it. <br>
<br>
Some things to try if you would like, and here is the difference it would make with ya.<br>
<br>
Your rings: replace them with Jagged Bands, You will lose approx 4 str from that, but will gain 10 raw AC. Of course you say you use the fire opals and those are awsome rings in themselves.<br>
<br>
Earrings: Try getting some dimondines. Easy camp at 50, or you can offer to help a few paladins in your guild to get the hilt for soulfire. She spawns in the same area and the earrings are a common drop. You will lose approx 2 str from this<br>
<br>
Face: Dented Brass mask is awsome, or if you can get one a Sarnak Hide mask is even better. With the dented you will lose approx 4 str, with the sarnak you will lose only 1. If you are wanted the dex for a weapon proc, try using a Grotesque mask. I think it has the same dex as your veil but will give you 3 AC which is alot better than none.<br>
<br>
Neck: the choker is useless. I think that is the one that gives agil, but I dont keep up with that type of jewlrey. Anything with AC will help alot, From your simple Bronze neck piece, to something that gives the stat you are wanted with an AC boost. Posiblities are Runed lava penant (easy camp at 50 but boring), Collar of undead protection (20pp hehe), or if you can get on some FG raids it is very hard to beat the Mithral Torque.<br>
<br>
Belt: For AC the thick leather apron, or straw spun belt. Those are very hard to beat, without getting into the uber dragon/plane/kunark ultra rare items. The FBSS of course is very tough to beat, although it has no AC rating, there is really no arguement against makeing most of our weapons 18% better.<br>
<br>
Head: The SSB is by far a better head piece than the Exe hood. Once again I assume you use the hood for procs. I didnt see what weapon you are using, but Ill assume its a GB for now. In places where undead is very heavy (guk, kith, ect..) the hood is an excellent piece. Although you wont notice a drop in procs if you replace the hood. Against the living, the SSB all the way. If you are worried about str, you might want to consider the Crested Helm. Although I dont think the str grants the loss of 3 AC, it is better than the exe hood which has only 5 AC (i think).<br>
<br>
So counting all of this up.. You will lose between 4 and 10 pts of str. From personal experience (using a TBB temperarily one day) you will hardly notice a decrease in damage output. Possibly at most a drop in 2pts off of your MAX damage hit. But you will also gained between 29 and 32 raw AC. <br>
+ 10 from rings<br>
+4 from earrings<br>
+5 from neck<br>
+5 from belt<br>
+8 or 5 from your helm<br>
-------<br>
32 or 29<br>
<br>
This will translate into approx 40 AC going with the higher end. <br>
<br>
So for a cost of losing 10 pts of strength (the basis of your last post &quot;you are not doing enough dmg&quot;) and a few other stats. You have the ability to gain another Valorium Breastplate worth of AC. <br>
<br>
If you dont think that will help you, next time you try and solo the gaurd you did your testing on. Take your BP off and see if you have to zone faster. I will be willing to bet all of my gear you would have to zone much faster.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my opinoin. Take it as you would want to. <br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Head: Skull Shaped Barbute for Magic Save, Exe hood most of the time<br>
<br>
I'd wear the SSB all the time, it adds way too much AC to justify the small stat bonuses on the hood. I giggle at 50+ paladins wearing that stupid hood.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Neck: Golden Black Pearl Choker<br>
<br>
Dex/Agi are next to worthless, get yourself a Necklace of Superiority or Runed Lava Pendant, or if you're lazy and don't wanna camp a Steel Collar will do you fine.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Ears: Electrum Sapphire Earrings<br>
<br>
Ugh junk, get yourself atleast a pair of Obsidian Beed Hoops, or Diamondine if it floats your boat. I for one don't like the Gold Topaz earrings, makes me feel cheezy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Face: Plat Ruby Vail for str, Plat Star Ruby Vail for dext<br>
<br>
The Plat Ruby Veil I can almost justify since it gives large bonuses to two good stats, but I'd still wear a Steel Mask over it. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Chest: Valorum Chest Plate <br>
<br>
Can't argue with that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Legs: Valorium Greaves<br>
<br>
This should take care of any Agi requirement you feel you need.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Boots: Boots of Ro<br>
<br>
I highly recommend you get a pair of DW boots, fairly common drop in Karnor's, well atleast as common as it gets there.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Hands: Gauntlets of Ro<br>
<br>
Again I'd recommend DW armor for this slot, it's recommended over Val because it is much more readily avaliable.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Wrists: Valorium Bracer and Hero Bracer<br>
<br>
Nothing wrong here.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Arms: Valorium Vambraces<br>
<br>
Wish I had a pair.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Waste: FBSS or Drakescale belt<br>
<br>
FBSS is fine, throw the drakescale belt away or better yet sell it to a druid/monk. If you need the AC and haste isn't important wear a Thick Leather Apron. Oh and stop spouting off about how you are right and 1000s of hours of testing by 100s of people are wrong.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Fingers: Plat Fire Emerald Rings or Plat Fire Wedding rings for AC and hit points<br>
<br>
I pity any high level character who wears Plat Fire Emerald, go with the Plat Fire Opal rings all the time they are exellent<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Range Slot: Runed Oak Bow<br>
<br>
You use a bow when you could pull with stun? Get a Kerran Toy.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Ammo: Magical Arrows (I make)<br>
<br>
I have nothing in this slot, cause I don't shoot anything.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Shield: Mistmoore for Dext, Cracked DW for str and higher AC<br>
<br>
Highly recommend a bark shield or scute shield if you can find one.<br>
<br>
Shoulders - No reason not to use a Tattered mantle, best ac for the slot. All other items for this slot are sub par.<br>
<br>
Cloak of the Icebear is an exellent cloak, only other compareable cloak in that range is the lizardscale which I think is highly overrated.<br>
<br>
This is all stuff you can pick up in Freeport or at your server's baazar. As for the other stuff you've been talking about, I stand with 0 buffs at 902ac, but then again I'm a Erudite;-)<br>

Shoulders: Try for crested spaulders, or a Tattered mantle. I had crested and picked up the Tattered Mantle yesterday for 300pp. Then sold the crested for 120 so i got the mantle at a decent price.<br>
<br>
Cloak : Cloak of the icebear is excellent. Good AC, awsome resist, and gives Hps. About the only thing better would be a hooded black cloak. <br>
<br>
As far as camping goes. We all hate it, and it can get boring. But for things like the dimondines you can of course help some paladins in your guild for the hilt like I mentioned. There is no race, so take your time. Consider all of these things small quests if you want. Or whatever will get ya motivated hehe. The drops in karnors will net exp while trying to obtain them, so it wouldnt be a complete waste of time there. Others will need to be gotten in trade if you dread being completely bored. <br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;I am wondering how having huge amounts of AC helps if you are not doing enough dmg to make the mob turn on you in the first place. That is my entire theory, do my share of the dmg and they will attack me and I don't HAVE to use stuns to piss them off, my weapon dmg pisses them off just fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
You must not be playing the same game, then. No amount of stats will significantly change your damage output - the highest strength I saw tested was 240 and average damage (i.e., damage/second) barely changed; less than a single point increase by moving from 60 strength to 240.<br>
<br>
You are wearing the same junk that pretty much all of us were wearing 6 or 9 months ago. If you believe so strongly that stats are so important, how about testing it like we did? Get a log parser (EQ Parse) and trying fighting with high stats and low stats - report your results. Until then, you are just an armchair quarterback.<br>

60 str verses 240 str equals one more point of average dmg, you are one funny dude, why don't you duel someone with 240 str with your 60 str?, See how it goes. And you guys all claim AC rules, last time I checked monks always have higher AC then my Paladin but can not tank nearly as well.<br>
<br>
I am playing the same game, you must really think you are a comedian, this is Paladins of Norrath right. That usually means folks are talking about Everquest, duh.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the non wise guy suggestions I will try them out, the suggestions that lead to a minor loss of str being the most helpful, cause I am not running around with 89 str like one guy said he had proudly.<br>
<br>
The suggestion for dw boots and gauntlets, I will certainly use them when I am lucky enough to get them. I am using the best items I have available in those slots.<br>
<br>
I think I will get a Runed Lava pendant, seems like the best neck piece compromise, the 4 str loss argument on Jagged Bands was a good point, and 2 str loss for Diamondine Earrings was a good point, I think I will keep the ruby veil cause it has 2 stats I need. I am getting a dented brass mask to try out however. <br>
<br>
I think I have a Bark Shield on my druid, do you really recomend it just cause of higher ac, 3 ac over a cdw shield and losing 9 str?<br>
<br>
Oh some of you may not know one reason for having 125 agility or higher is if you are running to zone you will still run if low on hit points, cause you lose 50 agility when near death, leaving you with 75 agility, could keep you alive.<br>
<br>
And the person who compared different strategies to equipment in a stupid video game to real life religion should seek help or have his medication upped immediately. Same for the guy who made a remark about the ppl thinking the earth is flat, as if my liking str makes me akin to thinking the world is flat is quite offensive.<br>

monks cant tank because:<br>
a) they have barely more hp than a caster<br>
b) the ac is in damage AVOIDANCE not mitigation, when thye do get hit they get hit HARD. <br>
<br>
I also play a monk. And AC is king to MONKS also. FOLLOWED by str. <br>

Then post here your damned tests made by a log parser.<br>
I have 86 str, yes 86, and through tests (compared to 160 or so with a shaman buff), the damage output difference was like 0.5-1%. If you don't have anything to show, then you're really like one who thinks the earth is flat.<br>
Btw you play a paladin right? You want to have the mob on you? Did you ever try that spell called stun? Last night I was grouped with a warrior, with my usual 86 str. He was pulling, but after a pair of rounds the mobs were ALWAYS on me. Why? Stun and Holy Might. And believe me, that warrior is a guy who knows how to play. <br>

 Re: lol<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here's something for you str geeks to look at. The MN formula :<br>
<br>
Magic Number (MN) = (2 x wpn dmg) + lvl bonus<br>
<br>
This is used for ALL weapons, yada yada. Magic number is basically the number you're going to hit for ALOT of times. This number does NOT change due to str, DOES NOT change. The only things that affect this are level &amp; weapon damage. Not even weapon skill has anything to do with this.<br>
<br>
The level bonus formula for two handers (which has been found to change at 51) is as follows :<br>
<br>
2H level bonus (51+) = (Level -7) / 3<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That was parsed at level 52 using a 2hb weapon with a 25 dmg rating (Rod Of Lamentation), 128 str, and 205 skill. Those red bars judge how often I hit for a certain number of damage. The more the red the more times I hit for that.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
My level bonus : (52-7)/3 = 45/3 = 15<br>
My Magic Number : (2 x 25) + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65<br>
<br>
Anyone care to notice what number the tall red bar hovers over? oh, look : 65. Notice where the shortest red bar is? The one I hit for like 0.01% of the time? Hey look, its at 99, my MAX dmg.<br>
<br>
Oh, and what does STR affect? Max dmg. and how is max dmg calculated? let's see...<br>
<br>
Max Damage (MAX) = (((Str + Wpn Skill)/100) x Wpn Dmg) + level bonus<br>
<br>
NOTE : I think there is a small flaw with this formula, you shall see in a moment, but it MINORLY affects the outcome therefore is still viable<br>
<br>
So my max would be :<br>
<br>
Max = (((128 + 205)/100) x 25) + 15 = (3.33 x 25) + 15 = 82.5 + 15 = 97.5, round that on up to 98.<br>
<br>
Well sheesh, I hit for 99? Damn.. that str may have tapped me up an extra point, but then again maybe not. Just look at how many times I hit for MAX. Boy, I bet that REALLY made a difference in my taunting abilities &amp; Average damage.<br>
<br>
What if I stacked another hundred str in? anyone care to guess what my max hit would be? and how often I'd hit for that or any numbers near it? Let's see.<br>
<br>
Max = (((228 + 205)/100) x 25) + 15 = (4.33 x 25) + 15 = 123.25, round that off to 123.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind your MN will NOT change due to str. How many times you think you're gonna hit anywhere near 123? You are not changing the MN, but you are adding more numbers you can hit, therefore, YES, str does affect average dmg, but in 3000 swings and you hit for over 100 say 50 times, you really think that's gonna change much of any outcome in the battle?<br>
<br>
I should also mention that your hit % DOES NOT get affected by str, it is a complete standalone attribute fixated on your level, skill, and mob level and there ac. If you think ATK means you're gonna hit more, you're wrong.<br>
<br>
If you feel like sacrificing ac for str, and then say you hit so much more, and do SOOO much more dmg, I'll try to keep from laughing back there in the distance. <br>
<br>
I took my time to evaluate what str means. Alagarn, if you are so inclined to see what str means first hand, go download EQ Parse and see exactly what we have been trying to tell you.<br>
<br>
Stats are expensive, AC is cheap. If you wanna get extravagent, forget braggin about your str because it hardly matters. Rather, go out and buy a suit of Rubi. People will know you have money, but who cares? I sure don't, and I'm pretty sure everyone but the beggars out there couldn't care less.<br>

As for his remark about my 89 str, I am DAMN PROUD OF IT.<br>
<br>
Thank you trueheart, your post is awesome, I am posting a link to this on my guild webpage. Good debate we have going  <br>
<br>
As for not tanking well, I, just as someone else posted, USE MY MANA. I stun, flash ect. and always take hits.<br>
<br>
Last night I was the only tank in a 6 man group, we had ZERO downtime (mostly thanks to my DW helm) but with my 860 ac the stuff would hardly touch me. <br>
<br>
All things considered though, I think truehearts post closed down this debate.<br>

Greetings,<br>
<br>
As has been said at every single point in this conversation, any increase in AC over any stat is worth it. Yes I would recommend the extra three ac on the bark shield over the +9 str on the CDS. The only time I'd recommend stats over any AC is when the gain is better than what you give up. Runed Lava Pendant or necklace of superority, you gain good resists and other stats for the loss of one ac over a steel collar. Now if you had a Polished Mithril Torc I'd change my story cause the three ac difference not to mention the stats already on the torc make it a much better item.<br>
<br>
As for a higher str increasing your average damage, yes it does, but in such a small amount it doesn't make much sense to take str over ac. For example if you had a str of 100 and your average damage was 7.0 points of damage a second and you increased your str to 180 your average damage would go up to roughly 7.1 or 7.2 damage a second. Hardly worth ditching 30-40 points of ac to get. Massive amounts of log parsing has proven this over and over again, its basicly indisputable.<br>
<br>
Lastly, if you aren't tanking then wear whatever you wish no one is hurt by it, but if you are tanking and don't wear your ac gear you only hurt your group and make your cleric heal more often. Do you really want to make the clerics work harder? They whine enough about healing paladins as it is=/<br>

Thank you Trueheart. Ive read posts basically identical to that 1000 times, and for some reason.. yours sunk in more hehe. Although I try to keep my AC up, what you just wrote helps make my choice even that much more concrete. Awsome post man, keep up the work. I am copying this one. That is definately a keeper post. <br>

Whoever thinks stats ever beat AC honestly hasnt been playing long enough. AC matters over all. Except for helms. Those must be tyranixx crowns, frog crowns, fine silk turbans or savants caps. Whatever you can get with no pic will do. I have parsed it and people wearing buckets take more damage. Im not lying. Really.<br>

All of you speak as though you have grouped with me and know if I can tank or not, I can tank just as well as ANY of you with your 900+ AC, any day of the week twice on Sunday. How do you know if 900 AC is the magic number on a given mob, or 1200? How do you know 825 AC will not deflect a blow from 99% of the mobs in the game as 900 AC will? Where are your logs to prove that? If the warrior in your group has 1200 AC and you have 900 you are a joke by your own admitions, you are NOT a tank up to his standards, and if AC is king you are a queen to that warrior, lol.<br>
<br>
I DON'T have to tank as well as a warrior, I am not suppose to. However in most groups I have been in with a warrior I certainly hold my own, I get hit the SAME, I don't get healed more, more or less the same dmg taken as the warrior. You all claim that 240 str verses (fill in the absurd low amount) str is a paltry .1 dmg difference, that is just so laughable. If you guys can only do .1 more dmg with high str you suck, and the dude who asked if I have heard of stun, can you read? Go back and you will see I said I don't HAVE to use stun to motivate the mob to attack me like you do, my weapon ACTUALLY pisses them off. If AC is king and stats suck, just go ahead and ditch ALL Stat items regardless of any minor loss of AC, cause stats do NOTHING, but AC rules. You guys need not waste any plat on items, cause a steel mask and steel collar have high AC in there given spots, only the rarest of Kunark stuff can replace them if AC rules. If you don't have the HIGHEST AC item in EVERY single spot on your dude you are a laughable queen of a tank, lol. Don't let me catch you AC freaks with Diamondine Earrings LOL you guys already proved str is totally useless so why recommend such a crappy earring verses a Golden Topaz Earring and Ivandyr's Hoop, don't settle for no sissy marry 2 AC each. And don't let me catch you with a Keran Toy, what a piece of junk compared to the latest and greatest thing to go in that spot, lol. Every item you guys get is obsolete unless it has the absolute highest AC known to eq, lol. If you have 1 AC less then ANYONE else on the server you are not a tank, you are a sissy marry. <br>
<br>
You cannot choose your kit, you must submit it to the Uber Paladins with no str Guild of Norrath for Approval, if they decline your application you MUST imediately sell every stat boosting item on your dude and forever bow to the followers of the AC deity, lol.<br>
<br>
If you are ever in danger of being killed by a mob in eq, you lack the proper AC, you are NOT a tank you are a sissy marry, because obviously the AC freaks are so damned tough they never need a heal, the cleric kneels before them and beg them to stay and protect them with their incredible AC numbers that don't do squat but look good and make them feel a bit tougher then the next guy who is tanking just as well as them. <br>
<br>
LOL, I am not going to equip ONE item you nerds recomended, it is my frigging Paladin and I will equip any gol darn thing I feel like it, I will wear mesh armor if I frigging feel like it, lol. If I want 240 str and hit as hard as I hit then that is my choice, I will still tank as well as ANY of you AC nuts, and I won't be the melee joke of the group you guys are. You nerds always quote these AC numbers, you probably have Heroism, Shield of Words, every little AC trinket you can spend a month each camping to get and still need a c heal, what a shock, lol. Meanwhile I play for fun, I actually play it as a game, and I still tank as well or better then any of you ac nerds, lol. <br>

as a matter of fact I DO wear a steel mask and collar. ok so I would upgrade to necklace of superiority or hangmans noose but I cant think of anything else Id wear instead...<br>

stun is pretty much a pallies raison d'etre, I am not in a damage competition with the warrior, I just stun the crap out of everything so a wiz can blow it up :-)<br>

Welcome back Alagarn. I see you posted such a thorough analysis on what STR does, and AC. I honestly don't care what you do with your paladin, you pay the cash. I do care thou about the people that group with you. If you would just take a minute and actually test yourself you'd see. But alas you won't.<br>
<br>
So many people thought the world was flat... <br>
...and so many people thought stats were all that.<br>
<br>
Sheesh Alagarn you come to this board, you do ask for advice, you do say you're going to check some of that out. Now all of a sudden you're god's gift to Norrath?<br>
<br>
And about being grouped with a warrior, yes we do need decent ac, why? because there are a lot of times where the cleric may be lom or oom and the warr is at 2 bubs of life? what then? should we just let the warrior die? Man you really do need to open your eyes. read throu this board, there's been alot of times people have stated &quot;If grouped with a warrior let them tank, and pull out your best damage output weapon&quot; - that's just fine &amp; dandy. Warriors are made to tank. But so are we, and I can taunt easily off alot of warriors, without even hitting taunt some days. what then? should I go by your standards and get my ass handed to me hopin my 240 str &amp; 640 ac will save me? Hell no! <br>
<br>
Get over yourself, man. It's not a personal flame, but I don't even see why you came here.<br>
<br>
&quot;I want advice, but you're all wrong, I know everything I need to know&quot;<br>
<br>
Glad I don't party with you Alagarn, cuz 100 ac means alot ALOT more than 100 str(15+ avg LESS dmg taken per hit vs 0.1 more dmg per second). But if you wanna be such a person to hug your stats and shun your ac, go for it. You came for advice, we gave it, explained it, you didn't like what you heard, so you're being quite rude. <br>
<br>
And yes I have grouped with you. For your sake I'll keep quiet about how EASY it is for you to drop. Sure you live with someone that plays a cleric - maybe that's why you never hear one complain, because you never group with a different one. If you do, hey, good. But I gurantee at LEAST one of them thinks you need better Gear. Just because Valorium shows doesnt mean you can take hits.<br>
<br>
BTW, come inspect me some day, see what Items I wear that sucks for ac, that I havent ditched stats for (FBSS aside). I gurantee I can taunt off you NP and I use a 2h weapon, and I can very likely outlast you on a strict Player vs Mob situation. <br>
<br>
Mr Sarcaasm, you asked, we delivered, you laughed and swore you were right. Tell me again why you came here? <br>
<br>
BTW I'm still awaiting you parses on AC &amp; STR. You said anyone with 240 ac that only gets .2 more dmg per second sucks, well, I guess everyone sucks (yes even you Alagarn), because str doesn't change much of anything. It's cheaper to increase ac for a much better damage absorption than it is to increase str for very little change other than a new number in your hit range. Oh, not only is it low cost and more affordable, but statiscally there is a better increase with ac than output of dmg. <br>

 Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Its very simple really.<br>
<br>
Why do rangers thing they are so horrible in the expansion. Its becuase their AC is so crappy.<br>
<br>
You cant read 2 posts on the rangers glade without some post complaining (and understandably so) about how low their AC is.<br>
<br>
Rangers are getting mauled in Kunark and by reducing your AC the same level as rangers, you are getting hit just as hard.<br>
<br>
No one can take a hit better than someone else if they have the same AC. So whether or not you &quot;tank well&quot; isnt a matter of opinion.<br>
<br>
Lastly, none of us really care what you do or what you wear. I think the reactions are mainly for the benefit of younder paladins on this board, so they dont get misplaced ideas.<br>

What started out as a nice rehash of the stats vs AC debate has completely degenerated.<br>
<br>
Alagarn, your comments are completely uncalled for.<br>
<br>
We've done the parsing. We KNOW what AC does. Have you done the same? When you have, and some support for your claims, THEN we'll continue this.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm damn proud of my 92 STR. Heck, I gave up my Hero Bracer to switch to Ro. The extra +5 save vs magic outweighs the -14 MR hit I take from the Silver Jacinth rings.<br>

I tried the AC vs stats test and I've been able to tank better than ever. I can take more hits when I taunt mobs off the warrior or when I'm the main tank. Also, now I stay behind whenever there's a train and tank all the mobs while my group runs to the zone, and I can still escape with 1 bub of health left. So if AC sucks so much, why has it saved my butt so many times? And you say, &quot;Well, I just don't believe that.&quot; Well this is coming from someone who used to wear bp jewlery and mith bp before I got a sm bronze collar, jagged bands, and a ebcp. <br>

I'll admit that, even fairly recently, I was a stat weenie. Str at 134 from 105, wis at 119 from 88, agi at 107 from 70 (didn't know squat about stats when I started  ), etc. Then I thought I'd check into this &quot;AC is king&quot; stuff. Every stat item I lost made me wince. But, wonder of wonders, I noticed that as my AC slowly climbed and my stats dropped, I actually performed better.<br>
<br>
Now, at 39 (just hit 40 but can't really comment on it yet), self-buffed and using yaulp II, I can get my AC to 800. And boy does that make a difference.<br>
<br>
Been hanging out in solb a lot lately. Used to be that if I couldn't get into a group right away, I'd hang out at the zone, healing and buffing, maybe throwing a slash or two in to help someone get to the zone--but if I was smart, I zoned right behind them. But now, I hang out near the zone and solo kobolds. Not always successful, and am always grateful for that heal or slash or two someone throws MY way, but I can actually solo a greater kobold, without using LOH. have only completely soloed two GK's (first time the noble ran by and smacked me in the head just as my opponent dropped, laying me out on top of him), but the fact is, I can do it.<br>
<br>
Why? Because I'm getting hit a lot less and getting hit for a lot less. My str is 112, my agi is 81 (some encumberance issues here, but I carry the +7 agi/dex necklace to help), wis is 94. I carry some wis/mana gear in case I need it, but I'm a much more effective tank than previously--due solely to my higher AC.<br>
<br>
In my final analysis, AC is king.<br>

 Re: Personal experience<br>

OK simple words and math.<br>
<br>
Assuming your right and str does affext combat then you are MAYBE getting a 10% total increase in overall damage over the course of a battle. Assuming your fighting one mob.<br>
<br>
BUT if you have high ac, not only will you survive longer in battle, you will do more damage also as you are getting more SWINGS in combat. In addition if you have multiple mobs in combat pounding on you all the addditional mobs willbe doing less damage. Ergo you last longer. Ergo you kill mob one and turn to mob two instead of dying to mob one while mobs two and three help him kill you.<br>
<br>
Raising AC makes you last longer in any melee your in. And any melee your in for longer, is a melee your doing MORE damage in. I can categorically state since I take so little damage in combat I DO more damage and can Tank mobs longer. I can alos keep mobs OFF other weaker members becasue my AC is so high. Mob frensy on the Casters while you fighting? NP! Stun, taunt, damage and then turn back to main mob. <br>
<br>
&quot;But I have 2 mobs on me now! I'll die!&quot; No you won't Your ac is so high they can hardly hurt you.<br>
<br>
Last night I tanked 4 blue Lizard in the Cazic Thule Temple Top while the rest of my group killed the casters. I lost a sum total of 1.5 bubbles of health when they were able to help me out. If I had not been abke to DO that ALL The group would have died. The cleric was LOM as were the casters. I bought them time to selectively kill while I held off the main force.<br>
<br>
I did my share of damage to be sure. But THAT is what Paladin tanking is about. SAVING THE GROUP. If you and your group LIVE through a fight you did something right. Mathematic PROOF in parsed logs and personal experience too have proven that Higher AC makes a bigger difference in combat than ANY amount of stat increases.<br>
<br>
If you do 100 damage a swing for 20 swings in low AC before Death, but 75 damage for 40 swings in high ac before a death, who does more damage? The guy with more AC.<br>
<br>
Try it and I bet you will have more fun. And lose the attitude. It is unbecoming a human being let alone a Paladin Character.<br>

I forgot where this quote came from but it seem so applicable:<br>
&quot;Okay...its your funeral&quot;<br>
<br>
This reminds me of a doctor named Smith(seems like a lot of guys where named Smith back then ^_^) who lived in London during the 17th century(IIRC). He noticed that during one outbreak of cholora that all of the people who got sick drank out of one well in that part of town. Centuries before germ theory was put forth, this guy had figured out what was causing this particular outbreak of the illness whether or not he understood the mechanism. For reasons beyond him, he saw people drank from the well and then get sick. That was enough proof for him. To fix the problem, he removed the well's pump handle. People stopped drinking the water and the cholora went away.<br>
<br>
You know what,Alagarn? No player out there knows what the Damage Dealing Formula really is. No player out there knows that the Damage Taking Formula is either. However we can setup semi-control situations and observe the results. We may not completely understand the mechanism that goes into dictating behavior in the game, but we can infer various things by watching the results.<br>
<br>
The results still stand and have been tested MULITPLE TIMES across every class that uses melee as their primary damage dealing mechanism. You put on stat gear and beat up a bunch of stuff and look at the results. You put on AC gear and beat up on the same bunch of stuff and look at the results. It really is quite conclusive. The amount of HPs you save(and consequently mana from the designated healer) is quite a lot. Unless you show any qualitative proof otherwise, you positiion is weak and you appear to just be stubborn.<br>
<br>
Alagarn seems to be from the school of &quot;best defense is a good offense.&quot; Sacraficing your defenses for a boost in offsense is at best risky and at worse deadly. Remember Sun Tzu's quote: &quot;Invinciblity lies in defense; A possiblity of victory lies in offense.&quot; If your defenses are so great that the enemy can't hurt you, then it doesn't matter how much offense you have...you'll win sooner or later. On the other hand, if you defenses are weak but your offense is powerful, then you expose your weak defenses every time you attack. The only way you can win is by being risky and agressive and attacking. What happens at the point you can no longer attack(ie stamina runs out, healer out of mana, slowed, blind, stunned, etc.)?<br>
<br>
It is one thing to say &quot;I don't care you guys say, I'm doing it this way!&quot; Its something else to say we are stupid for taking a stance that you don't agree with. If you really don't believe that AC is what we say it is, wander over to the Warrior boards and ask the same question. They live and die by melee factors far more than Paladins. You'll get exactly the same response.<br>

&quot;don't insult me&quot;<br>
<br>
why do we see that quote from people who refuse to parse the data?<br>
<br>
The math seems fairly straight forward to me, your reaction seems a bit over the top.<br>
<br>
No one is trying to insult you. What seems to be alluding you is that MANY others did the research and what did they find? That increasing AC meant that they lived longer while increasing stats (like str) had very little effect. So little as to reasonably be considered negligable.<br>
<br>
It's an interesting question about &quot;is there an AC plateau? A point that there are diminishing returns...&quot; I'd be interested in the answer. All the data I've seen suggests that is not the case, but I haven't seen any this topic, but my days of parsing data are over. <br>
<br>
At this point it appears that making a decision to wear a Brigadine Tunic &quot;cuz I like the cool color&quot; is practically as valid as &quot;cuz I need the strength.&quot;<br>
