She is so delicate when she sleeps, untroubled. Seriyn treasures these morning moments when he wakes before her. Jezeran Hateslayer…Jezeran….Seriyn runs the name over and over in his mind. She’s unbelievable. A Knight of once unswerving beliefs, who is now struggling to find that faith once again. She’s deadly in battle, more skilled than most warriors Seriyn has met. Loyal, honorable, giving, Seriyn knows this time he has had with her is special.  These months that he and Jezeran have traveled together have been the greatest of Seriyn’s life. He has wanted to tell her his developing feelings, how much he is falling in love with her, but the opportunity has not yet presented itself, Seriyn chuckles softly, or he has not made the most of his opportunities. <br>
<br>
Seriyn smiles inwardly and buckles the last strap of his golden armor over his thigh. He stands and stretches, loosening muscles grown tight from sleeping on the ground.  The weather is warm in the mountains of Firiona and here in the valley that connects the Firiona Mountains to The Overthere it is an especially nice morning. The chirping of the birds and the fresh dew on the grass always lightened Seriyn’s heart. He enjoys taking a morning walk as he communes with his God and prepares himself for the day and this morning will be no exception. He quietly rifles through his pack, withdrawing a small well-worn leather-bound book that bears the emblem of Mithaniel Marr in silver embedded in the face.  He and Jezeran have camped in a small open area between several large boulders for the past few nights and it has proven to be a very safe spot. Still, Seriyn scans the area before beginning his morning stroll through the valley. He has to be careful as the area is far from anything considered civilized and there are many wandering beasts that would love to have him for breakfast. He breathes in deeply, letting the moist rich morning air fill his lungs and begins a leisurely stroll down the valley back towards the Firiona Mounts.  After a few hundred yards, Seriyn comes upon a smooth boulder, just made for sitting. He sits and opens his book of prayer, beginning the day as he does each day, in the presence of Mithaniel Marr.  <br>
<br>
His thoughts drift back over the events of his past. Mithaniel bestowing his gift on him, his training, his new family the Fellowship of Valor, learning who his real father was, meeting Jezeran…there was so much to think on, so much has happened, so much is yet to happen. Seriyn knows it’s only a matter of time before the enemies of his father take an interest in him. He’s already heard the necromancer Selilya has been asking his whereabouts. Seriyn sighs and rubs a hand along the back of his neck. Her and her guild the Violent Harvest has to be stopped, soon. Their brazen attack on Felwithe sent much of the land into shock. They’ve grown powerful, much more powerful than when the Fellowship and Seriyn’s father first stood against them. It is only a matter of time before the two guilds clash again, especially with the plans that the Fellowship has in place. <br>
<br>
“Interesting reading?” a voice queries in heavily accented common marked with the dark almost sinister lilts that mark the speech of the Teir’Dal, interrupting Seriyn’s reflections. <br>
<br>
Seriyn raises his eyes from the page of his book. It’s a Dragoon. His armor marks him as a member of the Neriak Guardsmen stationed in The Overthere. “Aye, that it is friend. This is my prayer book; I am a Cleric of Mithaniel Marr. Would you like for me to read some of it to you?” Seriyn replies fluently in the native tongue of the dark elf.<br>
<br>
The elf snarls, “I have no desire to hear of your dog-god priest. Do not address me again in the tongue of the true race. I would suggest you begin crying in your own tongue while you can, soon I’ll be removing it from your head.” <br>
<br>
Seriyn closes his prayerbook slowly. He replies to the Teir’Dal switching his speech, marking it with undertones and ancient words that only the Teir’Dal elders would know well, “It is unwise to speak in such a manner to a Battle Cleric of Mithaniel Marr, lest you wish to see what a pup of  this “dog-god” as you say can do to a worm. Turn, take your leave. Cower back into the shadows until you can strike at my heel. Deceit marks cowardice, Hate is easy and for the weak. You stand before a Servant of Truth,  a Guardian of Valor,  only the strong follow this road. The strength of my Lord Mithaniel Marr will ring in your ears for a lifetime if you are foolish enough to stand against me. ”  Seriyn is now standing, his prayerbook held at his side, conviction flashing in his eyes.<br>
<br>
The dark elf chuckles lowly and drops his hand to the pommel of the sword rests in the sheath at his waist.  “I’m going to enjoy kil…”<br>
<br>
“Enough talk.” Seriyn thrusts his hand forward, palm out while muttering a quiet prayer in an ancient language. Immediately the air is rent as a great force of magic strikes the Teir’Dal in the chest knocking him from his feet and stunning him momentarily. <br>
<br>
The dark elf pulls himself to an elbow, shaking his head to clear it of the effects of the blow. He looks up at Seriyn, “You will die slowly priest.”<br>
<br>
Seriyn feels the familiar presence of Marr’s power flowing through his body. He feels the wrath of his god building in him, courage fills him and the knowledge that Truth will overcome. Seriyn knows he is outmatched. The Dragoons of The Overthere have a vicious reputation. Yet not an ounce of fear shows on the handsome cleric’s face as the air begins to shift and change color around his hands, the result of Mithaniel’s power flowing through his servant. The dragoon quickly realizes what Seriyn is doing and rolls to his feet, drawing his sword in the same motion. The Teir’Dal lunges, using his momentum to thrust himself forward, slamming his shoulder into Seriyn’s midsection and interrupting his spell.  Seriyn is much bigger than the elf and easily shoves the guardsman backwards, but as the dragoon stumbles backwards he strikes out with his sword slicing a deep gash into Seriyn’s right thigh. Pain instantly shoots through Seriyn’s body. The dark elf smiles as he circles the young cleric.<br>
<br>
“Hurts doesn’t it?” the dark elf’s smile quickly vanishes as Seriyn runs his hand down over the wound. A brief blue light pulses over the wound as it fades and then disappears. “Bah” the elf snarls, “you won’t be able to heal all of them.” <br>
<br>
Suddenly, the Dragoon is all over him, following each expertly placed swordstroke with another. Seriyn wishes he had not left his shield and hammer at the campsite.  Seriyn dodges and heals. He strikes out with his god’s power, but quickly the Dragoon is overpowering him. Seriyn’s eyes flash red as he draws on the last of his strength calling down the Wrath of Mithaniel Marr upon his opponent but, before he can finish the prayer, he feels the Dragoon’s sword slide deep into his gut, ripping and tearing through vital organs until it emerges on the other side.  Seriyn stumbles. He feels the warm rush of liquid run down his body and into his boots.  The Teir’Dal makes a quick motion, ripping the sword from Seriyn’s midsection while driving the blade to the right. The pain denies him the ability to stand straight, so, Seriyn cradles his stomach, trying to keep his insides where they belong. The fight is over; he has lost.<br>
<br>
The dark elf chuckles, “It won’t be long now priest.”  The dragoon circles the dying cleric while wiping his blade clean on Seriyn’s robes. He bends and whispers in Seriyn’s ear, “The questions is…do I let you bleed to death…or to I just kill you outright? What do you think?”<br>
<br>
Seriyn struggles to take a breath, hissing in pain as he straightens his stance to look the dragoon in the eye. “I think you take to much for granted.”<br>
<br>
The Teir’Dal laughs. “Perhaps you are right. A quick death then.”  The elven soldier thrusts his sword forward to end Seriyn’s life, but, with an almost inaudible phrase and an almost imperceptible motion of the cleric’s hand, the blade is deflected. The dragoon snarls and whips around, singing his sword with all his might at Seriyn’s head, but once again the sword deflects harmlessly, as if blocked by some unseen guardian.<br>
<br>
“The Truth is undying and Valor unyielding, elf.” The power of Faith flashes in Seriyn’s eyes. “Mithaniel protects me; you can not harm me.” <br>
<br>
The dark elf snarls. “There will be another day human.” The dragoon turns to leave, pausing for but a second “Your enemies have friends young Battleseeker.”<br>
<br>
Seriyn grits his teeth in pain as he watches the Dragoon turn to leave, wondering hoa nad why he knew his name. Seriyn can’t return to camp until he is sure the dark elf isn’t watching him or Jezeran’s life will be in danger. His robes are soaked through with blood and the ground is already sticky with it. The battle left Seriyn sapped; he doesn’t even have the strength to heal himself. He just hopes he can live through the hike back to camp.  As the figure of the Dragoon becomes small in the distance, Seriyn turns and heads back to the campsite, hoping that he will see his Knight once more.<br>
<br>
<br>
The walk isn’t long but it seems like an eternity. Seriyn’s vision is constantly turning black, his loss of blood preventing all his senses from working properly. Twice he has slipped on his blood-covered boots and fallen and twice he has pulled himself to his feet to continue. Seriyn knows a third fall will be his last. He’s been carefully placing each foot down, one in front of the other, walking purely on strength of will now.  Finally he sees the camp. Jezeran has risen and is sitting cross-legged, her sword resting across her knees, deep in her morning prayers. Jezeran has grown accustomed to Seriyn’s morning walks and each of them enjoyed their time spent alone in prayer. Welcoming each other back from their separate meditations with breakfast and morning conversation. This morning will be different.<br>
<br>
He watches her, trying to keep his eyes focused, knowing if he can just make it to her he will be all right. He watches as Jezeran hears him enter the camp, watches as her face brightens into a smile, watches as she turns to greet him and her smile instantly turns into a look of horror. <br>
<br>
“Seriyn!”, Jezeran stands and sprints towards him. <br>
<br>
Seriyn forces his face into a smile, “Jez….” , and the world goes black as he falls forward into her arms. <br>
<br>
_____________<br>
<br>
<br>
The smell of meat cooking on a fire wakes Seriyn from his sleep. He feels bandages wrapped tightly around his midsection. He’s alive. He starts to raise himself to an elbow to see where Jezeran is, “Ouuuccchhh!” , immediately she is at his side, brushing his hair back from his eyes and running a palm along his forehead. <br>
<br>
“Lay back and relax Seriyn, you are still wounded. I used the Power of Erollisi to lay hands on you when you arrived, but your wounds were great and some still linger.”<br>
<br>
Seriyn smiles, “Thank you Jezeran.”<br>
<br>
Jezeran returns his smile and let’s her hand rest on his cheek, “It is my duty and honor to serve. Now,” Jezeran stands quickly and heads to the fire, “I thought you would want some warm food instead of the tack we have been eating. I hunted some while you rested.” <br>
<br>
“Yes, that would be wonderful.” Seriyn grunts in pain again as he forces himself to a sitting position. “You really patched me up well Jez.” Seriyn chuckles. “I can hardly move.”<br>
<br>
“The bandages have to be tight, otherwise what good are they.” Jezeran gives Seriyn a stern glance, “I said to relax Seriyn.”<br>
<br>
“Aye my dear Knight that you did, but your commands are not quite as strong as the commands of Nature, although you are getting better.” Seriyn snickers as Jezeran’s face flushes slightly. “Help me to my feet please.” <br>
<br>
Jezeran carefully helps Seriyn up off the ground, “Do you..err..will you…”<br>
<br>
“Do I need your help?” Seriyn’s tries not to smile at Jezeran’s obvious discomfort. “Nae, if you can just lead me to that tree over there I think I can manage.”<br>
<br>
<br>
When Seriyn returned to camp Jezeran was busy hanging up his robes. She had cleaned them thoroughly, along with his boots and armor. She had dressed him while he was unconscious in the light pants and tunic he wore underneath his armor padding. <br>
<br>
Jezeran watches Seriyn closely as he slowly creeps back into the camp, her concern evident on her face. “You are a stubborn man Seriyn Battleseeker. Will you rest now?”<br>
<br>
“Aye Jezeran, I will. The meat has to cook a bit yet, will you sit next to me as we wait? There is something I would talk to you about.” Seriyn motions to the log placed not far from the fire.<br>
<br>
“What is it? Is something wrong?” Jezeran rises, taking Seriyn’s arm and helping him sit down.<br>
<br>
“'Well.....” Seriyn coughs as Jezeran smiles warmly at him. “'It's that we have spent so much time together, and you know that I love you dearly”<br>
<br>
Jezeran nods at Seriyn.<br>
<br>
“During our conversations earlier we spoke of spending a lifetime together” Seriyn glances at Jezeran hoping he is choosing his words correctly. “and with recent events I realize how important you are to me.”<br>
<br>
Jezeran looks intently at Seriyn.<br>
<br>
“Though you will always be in my heart, I would like to make my promise to you, give my life to you, my future and all that I have, if you will have it.” Seriyn kneels before Jezeran in humility and reverence, “I ask you for your hand in marriage.”'<br>
<br>
Jezeran smiles through tears of joy and replies, “I love you much, Seriyn. If you will have me, I would think of no greater honor than to be your wife.”<br>
<br>
Seriyn removes a small pearl ring from his pack, “I am not a rich man Jezeran, but please take this symbol from me now, until I can find a token more worthy to represent our love” Seriyn smiles.<br>
<br>
Jezeran beams, “I wear it proudly. I wear it with joy and with a heart full of love for you.” Jezeran gently places her arms around Seriyn, giving him a loving kiss while being careful not to aggravate his wounds. “I love you my cleric”<br>
<br>
Seriyn smiles, “And I you my Knight in Shining Armor.”<br>
