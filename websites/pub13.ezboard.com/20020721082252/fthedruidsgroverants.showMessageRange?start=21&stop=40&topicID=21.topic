I know, I know its hard to tell the difference sometimes but I think ANYBODY going ga ga over a digital character needs to get a life. I understand that for some this does it for them...but personally I prefer flesh and blood to cold plastic keys and a lonely study room. I dont care if this is your deal If you get off on the likes of Lara Croft and games that have a secret codes to see the women character's tits then so be it, that is none of my business. What is my business is when you try pushing that @#%$ on me and other women like me. Some think its cute, others think its repulisive I suggest you try getting to know somebody before you start up the CyberSex. And I didnt try singling out just men...but its seems this more prevalent in men then women...JMHO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=meza>Meza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Local user</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/21/99 11:40:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web2.airmail.net/rschell/signmeza.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Girls ect.</span><hr size=1> Actually, I've had very little of it..could be I'm in wolf form most the time.

So I give them away. My preferred method though, it to hang on to them as I hunt until I see a lower level in a hard fight, maybe even close to dying. If they need a heal, I'll drop a couple on them until the beast is dead, then give away whatever it is I have to give - all without saying a word. Isn't my purpose to cyber, nor to stare at their scantilly clad cartoon bottom if they're female, nor to hang around for chat. Soon as the giving is done, I leave, go back to hunting and only rarely answer the tell I sometimes get thanking me.  <BR>  <BR> So why give away in the first place? Because there's not a huge amount of giving in EQ to begin with. Too many people too interested in just making money, just making level. I have one of those cursed memories too in that I never forget how other characters act. If I offer a gift, and get a tell asking if I can spare anything else, it's pretty much a sure bet I'll avoid that person in the future. I like grouping with people who respect others. Giving to lower levels working their way up is a good way of seeing what kind of person they are before you end up grouping with them as part of a pvp raid at some point in the future.  <BR>  <BR> Gotta say this too. My aboslute best friend I've made since I came to EQ is a female barbarian warrior. The absolute worst group I was ever in was all female except for me. Either way, yeah, no secret as to the sexual leanings of the game designers. If you doubt that, walk up to a barb female as a human character. Got to look up to see her face. Otherwise your gaze rests squarely in a zone that would cause trouble in real life. Best advice I can give is to stay away from the sexual stuff and stick with making a friend regardless of whether they're male or female. Never know when they might be wandering by when you're in trouble and save your butt.  <BR>  <BR>  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Warryn of Kelethin</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(9/30/99 6:22:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Girls am I the only one experiencing this?</span><hr size=1> I played UO, and it was quite the same there.

With one character, a high elf enchantress, it was so bad I almost quit the game.  I had two male PC's vying for my attentions and trying to outdo each other.  To solve the problem, I first made a female Troll Shadowknight thinking I wouldnt get any of that anymore.  I finally wound up changing servers and switched to male characters.  I am one of the few women in RL who play a male character and I have told NOONE about my real identity.  I like being accepted as who I am on the inside, proving myself in battle and groups, etc. and I dont miss the sexual comments one bit.  I also give stuff away equally to male and female characters.  <BR>  <BR> An interesting aside, I have a friend who is a male in RL and plays a female character in the game.

I am a female in RL and play a female woodelf druid.  I am a huge flirt.  Not because it gets me stuff, because that is just how I am, RL and RPG. I rarely ask anyone for anything (I've had to ask for batwings on occassion to help with corpse retrieval), and yes, I have had some very nice things given to me, always refusing the gifts, but will take nonetheless (they ASSURE me the stuff is just taking up bank space).  And this will really get a lot of you ladies tee'd, but I *like* the idea of having a man 'protect' me from the meanies.  I will go down dying everytime, but to see all the men in the group trying to protect me, I just adore it.  Flame me, I can feel it coming!  But I wouldn't change the way I play for anything, I have too much fun.  Do note that I don't allow for degrading behavior on the part of a male character - someone got his rear kicked in a duel last night for slapping my arse (he knew he deserverd it and apologized too) =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://server3.ezboard.com/uaawulf.showPublicProfile>Aawulf</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/26/99 12:52:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm</span><hr size=1> I hope everyone knows that many play the &quot;hot&quot; women of Norrath to get the freebies and many play it up.

I have to agree with those other males who basically said that while proud and happy to be male, I can't help but feel somewhat embarassed too for the behavior of some of the others.  Personally, I love to help out folks, newbie or otherwise.  However, it didn't take long after starting my char that I realized the advantages that the women have in terms of free (and sometimes unwanted) stuff.  So, while I work hard at helping everyone, regardless of gender, I also try my best to help out any newbie men I see too.  Way I see it, nobody else will, so someone should make sure they feel welcome too.  Still in the middle of colecting raw-hide for a couple half-elf brothers I met..... (hey, I may be generous, but I'm POOR too :) ) <BR>  <BR> I have a good friend who speaks to me often about the amount of attention she receives with her wood elf druid(s).  On one server, a GM (!!!)(and yes, she actually checked for his name on the roster) actually approached her (he at level 50, her at 1) and started to hit on her when she said hi while walking by.  They talked for a bit, and before she knew it he was 1) handing over a crap load of stuff and 2) asking her to marry him when she reached level 20.  This was after her char had been alive 30-45 minutes, all but 5 of which had been spent talking to this GM.  Now I will readily admit she is a wonderful person, and great fun to talk to, but isn't that a tad early in their &quot;relationship&quot; for engagement?  On another server, she actually had two guys so enamored with her that they wanted her to destroy her original char and create two new ones for them to marry after they power-leveled each one.  This lead to a hilarious situation in which (b/c of his ridiculous jealousy) I went to visit her in my RL fiancee's char (yet another female wood elf druid).  He hits on me, I flirt back, he eventually leaves, we laugh about it, and then two other males show up and begin flirting with us.  It was hilarious: she was preoccupied with /tells from yet another suiter at the time (there were four for this char total), so I handled all the flirting back.  I was crying from laughter in RL from the insanity of it all, and I had to laugh even harder when I left the situation with more gear for my RL fiancee's char I was playing.  I took my friend's comment that had she met me in that char she'd have thought I truly was a woman from the personality and mannerisms I used to be very high praise. :)  Shoot, maybe I SHOULD go back into acting....She has since decided to create yet another druid for herself (we're her fav class) and only reveal its connection to her other chars to myself and her family members who play.  It's sad, really, though, that so many guys try for her attention (she's just too nice and sweet with them, that's my opinion) she can't feel comfortable playing her old char. <BR>  <BR> Anyway, just wanted to say &quot;Yes, ladies, you truly have reason to think men are idiots for the behavior many show you, but please remember that a few of us are still worth grouping with.&quot; :) <BR>  <BR> Belodion Wolftanzen <BR> Order of Light <BR> The Rathe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Brisblood </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/28/99 3:59:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Funny is all i can think of  =)</span><hr size=1> My first char i made was a male paladin half elf. <BR> I hit on chicks of higher lvl and they would give me stuff. <BR> God i can still go to xegony and have a chick go get me equips. hehe <BR> I also made a female necro and what do you know?? its even easier to get males <BR> to run and get me nice stuff.
