Look at the patch message for every patch and you see what they fixed.  However, I don't blame them for fixing it so EQ doesn't work with show EQ.  I don't really care one way or the other about show EQ normaly, but I don't want to see all the content in Luclin itemized the second day either.  A 'fix' so showeq doesn't work is certianly within their rights and would take a different programmer than the one who's fixing the graphics engine and the content most likely anyway. <p>Batou of The Nexus<BR>

<br>
I personally wouldn't play EQ without SEQ, as fun as it is running all over a zone looking for a mob or a ground spawn, its much nicer being able to run straight to it, its also nice being able to see whether that creature that cons blue is going to summon you or start casting.<br>
<br>
Its a very handy utility and it has a great potential to help or hinder EQ. Example: I can see where every yew leaf in wakening lands is, I ran around and picked up 2 stacks of the things while I was bored and ended up handing them to a tailor who was very happy. If someone shouts 'anyone seen my corpse' then I can just /tell them with the loc.<br>
<br>
I can also use it to tell me exactly when Lodizal spawns or any other rare spawn which means I stand a much better chance of getting the rare stuff than others.<br>
<br>
I managed to get a knotted turtle bone ring from doing precisely that (was awared to me for helping a guild get eyepatch of plunder by point out all the mobs).<br>
<br>
SEQ is definately cheating, I have no issues with it and it'll probably annoy some people on these boards but it just makes EQ fun again. It isn't fun running around looking for lions and spiders but SEQ makes it a lot more bearable.<br>
<br>
Same thing with 'EQW' (runs EQ in a window), I wouldn't play without that either. I don't think these are features that EQ NEEDS, but rather, features EQ would be a lot more fun to play if they were built in.<br>
<br>
As far as SEQs functionality (incase anyone isn't familiar with it), it gives you a 2d wireframe map (no colour or fancy bits) with labels and landmarks on it. It draws all the NPCs dynamically onto this map with a colour related to the con of the creature, you can get the level, hitpoints (as a percentage, proper value for PCs), location, race, class, spawntime and items.<br>
<br>
it will tell you if they're holding something like a velium scimitar, you can't see stuff like 'oh look, that snow cougar has a cougar claw earring', only things that reflect changes in the look of the NPC will be listed, such as weapons. It sort of works on PCs, it will list things like Ry'Gorr as a generic 'chain'. It won't tell you exactly what people are wearing, but a rough idea.<br>
<br>
It has a log to it, it will keep track of all spells cast upon you and spells you cast (very handy for groups). It can tell you what items you have and how much cash (even stuff in bank, from anywhere). It tracks current levels of all skills and most stats (things that change regularly like hitpoints, mana, stamina, food and water, not stuff like AC and wis).<br>
<br>
It is a very handy util but it basically destroys EQ, especially from a roleplay point of view.<br>
<br>
Its an open source project at: http://seq.sourceforge.net<br>
<br>
If you don't have any moral dilemas with cheating and you happen to have a linux box then give it a try, you're bound to like it.<br>

Bad wording on "earn"... I simply meant it's more satisfying :)   Or seems that way to me.<br>
<br>
If you played EQ in The Beginning and enjoyed all the creeping around and exploring unknown areas, and look back on it fondly, then that's what I mean here.  Expansions are an opportunity to live through the excitement of exploration once again, and that's why I think trying to temporarily disable the temptation of SEQ is a good idea.  IMO it wouldn't be quite the same if you could "explore" a zone just by loading up SEQ, looking at the map and noting where all the different mobs are.<br>
<br>
But then if you enjoy it better like it is now, where you know every zone back to front and exactly what mob will be around the next corner... fair enough.  Use your ShowEQ :p  (Though if you use it to look for named rares and such, I still think they'd be well in the right to ban your ass.  As a reminder, I deleted it the moment that became a temptation.  I'd rather not cheat in the first place - let alone get banned for it)<br>
<br>
But I'm one of those who used to play Doom without typing iddqd and idkfa at the beginning of each level *shrug*  I just can't see the point if there's almost no challenge.<br>
<br>
However, I use eqatlas all the time... saves a lot of dying (The good old EXP penalty - VI's very daft way of discouraging people from exploring).  Just saying that sometimes exploring for yourself is more fun and satisfying in the long run.  SEQ takes it a step further... you zone into somewhere and instantly know where everything is.  I ask... where's the satisfaction?<br>
<br>
I guess that's why I'm on FV.<br>
<br>
Not trying to be patronising though - play however you like!<br>
<br>
Though I won't pretend to be in favour of cheating.  SEQ is bannable for some very good reasons.  (Hopefully pretty obvious... like it's unfair to have a huge advantage in finding named rares unless it's part of the game design - eg. tracking) <p>-- <BR>
