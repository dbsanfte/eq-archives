By ellocopato<br>
<br>
The First Floor:<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
Upon entering the tower the first things that you will notice is a huge hole in the floor and many doors. <br>
<br>
Directly infront of you will be a door with two banners hanging from the sides.<br>
Specters called “Lesser Ice Shades” spawn on either side of the door. They have a very slow respawn rate however, remember this door for later reference.<br>
<br>
Traps Warning: <br>
Careful the floor is very slippery and inside the hole are 3 shadowbone skeletons that think you very tasty.<br>
<br>
<br>
Proceed to the second left-hand door, inside this room are many shadowbone skeletons, kill them then camp the hallway of this room. Pull as you like from the other rooms. <br>
<br>
Eventually one of two things will happen: <br>
(1 The Rare will spawn in one of the rooms <br>
(2 The Keyholder will instaspawn once what you’re killing is dead. <br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “A Large Undead Gnoll” and drops the Crystal Key, the key to then next level.<br>
<br>
The Rare is “Xalgoti” a named Shadowbeast, he drops Crystallized Shadow Tunic rarely.<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the double bannared door previously mentioned. On the left-hand side is a port to the 7th level but needs a key from the boss mob of the tower so skip it for now, and head to the right-hand side. Put the key on your mouse cursor and make sure your entire group is close to you, and hit U (Note for multiple raid groups you’ll need a key for each group it only takes up the groupmembers of the keyholders’ group).<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The mirror out on this floor is right behind of port in.<br>
<br>
The Drops on this level:<br>
Various Gnome Skin Armor (Crappy AC with Poison resist looks like pure black cloth with no designs.)<br>
Various Fading Shadow Weapons<br>
Shadow Bone Earrings (4 Agi 2 Int)<br>
And Various Crystallized Armor (Low ac high stats)<br>
A Crystal Key<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Second floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
Upon port up you will enter an old library filled with Erudite Ghosts. Buff up MR immediately and switch on Resist gear, because nearly everything on this floor casts.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trap Warning:<br>
There is a bookshelf on the right-hand side of the Port Up that screams like a cougar and will claw you. Rogues can disarm this. It will not follow you, so more of a little flavor trap.<br>
<br>
Now you can either sit at port in and pull to there or wander around killing the erudite ghosts. There are way too much spawn on this level to point out but they’re nearly all Necromancers, Magicians, Wizards, or Enchanters. <br>
<br>
There are a few static spawns I should point out, on the booth infront of port in are the Librarian and The Librarian Assistant, these both don’t drop anything special other then crystallized but are named. The second is a hut left of the Port up, inside is a Ghostly Teacher and a Student, both drop nothing.<br>
<br>
Kill the ghosts and eventually one of two things will happen:<br>
(1 the keyholder will instaspawn once your target is dead<br>
(2 The Rare will spawn.<br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “A Angry Librarian” and drops the following<br>
<br>
Angry Librarian:<br>
<br>
The Three Toothed Key (Always)<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The rare is “Zorglim the Dead” and drops crystallized pieces uncommonly and sometimes rarely a Crystallized Shadow Tunic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the next level, to get there head straight out from port in to the door and follow the hallway to the mirror, put the key on your coursor and click U.<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The Mirror Out on this level is on the far left-hand corner, there is a bookshelf, click on it to move it aside but be careful because 2 Students guard behind it. Kill them or run around them and click on the mirror. <br>
<br>
<br>
Drops on this level:<br>
Various Crystallized Armor Pieces<br>
Various Fading and Velium Weapons<br>
Various Gnome Skin Armor.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
The Third Floor:<br>
----------------<br>
**I need more info on this floor I haven’t been on it very long at all **<br>
<br>
Upon the port up to the Third floor you will find you have entered a creepy manor type décor. <br>
<br>
Trap Warning: No traps on this level that I know of but there are a lot of fake walls.<br>
<br>
Proceed right of the port in area killing anything in the way. Ignore the doors on the sides, sleepers sometimes spawn there but otherwise they are empty. <br>
<br>
Eventually you will come upon a room with Shadowbeast cooks, pull them and kill, turn left and head straight until you come upon a room with a big Table in the middle. Camp here and pull the other rooms to here and eventually one of two things will happen:<br>
<br>
<br>
(1 The Keydropper will instaspawn on what you’re killing.<br>
(2 The Rare will spawn.<br>
<br>
The Keydropper is “An Enraged Shadow Beast” and it drops the following:<br>
<br>

<br>
The Rare is “An Enraged Cook”<br>
<br>
Note: Some people confuse the cook with the enraged beast, I think maybe prepatch they were switched but as it stands now the drop info is correct for the Beast but I’m not sure on the cook. **Need help with Drop info on the Cook**<br>
<br>
Grab the key and proceed to the Mirror to the next floor. Proceed straight up the tunnel that led you to the Dining Room. Ignore any turns and kill anything that jumps you, go straight until you cant anymore then follow the tunnel to the mirror. Put the key on your mouse cursor but make sure your group is good mana and hps cuse the next floor is nasty. Hit U once those conditions have been met.<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
Bedroom with zombie maids. Turn right, then left at the shadowbeast room. It's all the way down this hall, last entryway on your right.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Things that drop here:<br>
Various Gnomeskin Armor<br>
Various Crystallized Shadow Armor<br>
Various weapons including crystallized, fading, and velium.<br>
Finely Crafted Velium Ring<br>
Chilled Scythe<br>
Frosty Key <br>
<br>
<br>
The Fourth Floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
As you port in you will notice you are in a brick maze, it’s mostly like a crypt. Buff your MR and Disease Resistance because The Shadows on this cast nasty spells, and the Ancient Mummies Proc Disease. Make sure to switch on your Resist gear! Be prepared to fight because there are many wanderers<br>
<br>
<br>
Trap Warning: If you go the wrong way there are fake floors that drop you into a room with a few mobs, run into the fire in the center and you will be teleported to the port up area.<br>
<br>
Early Mirror Out:<br>
From the port in on your right is a White door, you can open this with either the key from the previous level or Lockpicks. **not sure skill worked for me at 200 lol** behind it are 3 mobs, kill them or run by them and there is a Mirror at the end of the tunnel, click on it and you will zone out.<br>
<br>
<br>
This maze is tricky, I offer you both a map link and directions<br>
<br>
Link: www.eqmaps.com/mapz/tower_level4.jpg<br>
<br>
Directions: <br>
Ignore the white door and take the first right you see, follow this tunnel but ignore the right turn you’ll see, this is a dead end with a mummy. Continue straight and ignore the left turn into a fake wall. Continue straight and you will come upon a single shadow, kill it and make sure you have a lot of mana and health. Next move up or pull the 4 Shadows and fight them. <br>
<br>
When rested head straight through the fake wall where the shadows hung out. There is sometimes a wanderer in this hall, kill it head straight and enter the mummy room. Cara Omica could be spawned in the empty coffin so be prepared. There is also a mummy that spawns in here if I remember correctly. This is your camp area. Sit down and pull the other rooms to you. Infront of you is the mirror to the 5th level, and 4 shadowmen in sets of 2.<br>
<br>
Spawn Order:<br>
Now there are 3 nameds on this level, and this is how I believe you spawn them.<br>
<br>
(1 Pull and kill till Narmak Berreka or his PH spawns. If his PH spawns start over from (1<br>
<br>
(2 When you kill Narmak Amonepheta or his PH will spawn, if his PH spawns kill it and start over from (1<br>
<br>
(3 If you kill Amonpheta, Cara Omica will insta spawn in the coffin. Kill her and she will trigger Narmak Amonpheta or Herself to spawn in a few minutes. <br>
<br>
The Keyholder is “Cara Omica” and she drops the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
Cara Omica:<br>

The Fifth Floor:<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
When you port up the first thing you should notice is Golems in Ice Pillars. You have arrived as an unwanted guest at an Undead Wedding.<br>
<br>
Trap Warning: No traps on this level. Have fun.<br>
<br>
It would be best to explain the spawns first. <br>
<br>
Unlike the other floors, the rares always respawn in the same area, have no PH. <br>
<br>
On any of the kills the Keyholder can Instaspawn, the Keyholder is “An Enraged Relative” and the rares are “Nosja” and “Daman” but its best to point out Ceremonial Wedding swords drop off all the guests rarely. Drop Information for them as follows:<br>

How to tackle this floor:<br>
<br>
Proceed to pull the Golems two at a time or if you have a high level with you have them hit them with a spell and single pull them. <br>
<br>
Once all the Golems are pulled Proceed to the opening to the wedding. Rest here at the door and you have many choices. You can either pull the wedding guests all at once and AoE them or you can try to pull a little at a time. These are pretty low level (half green to 40 half blue) try to kill them all first. <br>
<br>
Now you should have the bride (Daman), the groom (Nosaj), the priest, two undead dancers, and a spawn or two in the back.<br>
If you have a high level, single the Groom, then the Bride, then the Priest. If not pull them and kill in this order: Priest first, then Nosja, then Daman. Priest is a Cleric, Nosja is a Necromancer, and Daman is a Shadowknight (Harmtouch)<br>
<br>
Kill all the rest in the room then you have several options:<br>
<br>
(1 Stay in the room and wait for repop Ignoring the back spawn eg. Golems<br>
(2 Move back to port in and kill them as above.<br>
(3 Stay in room and pull out the cubbies<br>
(4 go upstairs and camp the Golems Above while waiting for repop.<br>
<br>
Or a combination of that.<br>
<br>
Once you have the key and wish to go ahead to level 6, Proceed to the Side room with Golem Ushers in it. Bout 1/4 of the way around the circle going counterclockwise from the zonein put the key on your cursor and hit U. <br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
The mirror out on this floor is very simple, when you port in turn around and it’s on the wall behind you.<br>

Sixth Level A:<br>
--------------<br>
Upon entering this level you will find many of the same creatures that were on level 1 except a lot harder. Ice shades and Shadow Beasts walk these halls as well as spirits of the undead.<br>
<br>
<br>
Trap Warning: Dragon statue AoE: stay away from the Dragon statue in the room with the ice shades and the mirror out. To know it’s the dangerous one check its hands, if they are flaming and smoking STAY AWAY!!<br>
<br>
Rare Info on this level: <br>
Killing stuff on this level might result in the spawn of<br>
An Incoherent Spirit. Kill him and randomly a Coherent Spirit will spawn. He's for a Kael Drakkal quest, nice reward. He can be found if you go all the way straight from the zonein (to the wall/banner), then turn right and right again.<br>
<br>
A incoherent spirit spawns on level 6 at the aforementioned place, has a rare drop "Abram's Axe of the Stoic", really nice melee weapon. Rare instaspawn off of incoherent's death is an npc quest ghost "lucid spirit of Abram". Part of a long and involved quest from Kael/Wakening. Lucid initially cons indiff to any faction when first spawned but will aggro when attacked and/or if you are fighting a mob near it.<br>
<br>
Proceed to forward killing anything that gets in your way and you come into a hallway with many turns and directions to take. Head right killing anything in your way, or camp here and pull the right till clear. <br>
<br>
Once the beasts are dead proceed up the stairs until you get to a platform above a library. Stay close, don’t fall off or get close to the edge or you will argo the Ice shades below. There are 3 beasts<br>
In the door to the platform, kill them and then rest up. When you are ready have each person on the raid click the mirror (no keys are needed)<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out:<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out on this level is hard to explain, but from port in head straight ignoring the first left, then take a second left. This should hopefully lead you to a room full of ice shades. Invis or pull them and kill. <br>
<br>
Avoid the Dragon Statue AT ALL COSTS stay away from it, it casts a nasty AoE that dropped our fully cleric buffed 53 warrior 2 bubs in seconds. If you are invis, hug the left wall all the way around till you get to the hallway out. Follow the hallway and click on the mirror to be transported out of this hellish room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Drops on this level:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sixth Level B:<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
You are transported to a small stone platform with water all around it and a bridge heading upwards.<br>

Here is how VhalSera works on the 6B floor. It is a triggered spawn. It does not come from killing bats, which I've done for 6 hours straight thinking that it may spawn.<br>
<br>
When you enter 6A, go straight until you hit the wall. Don't turn at the first intersection. Once you hit the wall, go left to the room with the (8?) ice shades and the Dragon statue AOE trap. Set up camp just before the room so that you don't constantly get hit by the trap, and have a caster pull so no puller gets nailed by the trap either. It will do a large amount of damage and dispell a buff or two.<br>
<br>
The mob that triggers VhalSera to spawn is located in this room (and possibly the other room with ice shades that is located below the mirror to 6B, but I have not confirmed that). I believe the exact name of the ice shades here are "a ice shade". The trigger to make VhalSera to spawn is called "an ice shade" (or if I'm mistaken, it's the other way around). It will look like a Spectre. It won't have a white graphic on its cuffs nor on its hood. It will be straight black, and if you let it stand around for long enough it'll cast a little skeleton pet. It took us a couple spawn rounds to finally get this one to spawn.<br>
<br>
Once killed, VhalSera immediately spawns on 6B. It spawns in the first green floored room, right in the middle (right where the bats like to stand around on top of eachother). Don't forget to make sure that no one is camping 6B or else you're going to spawn the geenie for them and then get fairly pissed off when you go up to find that they profited from your camping. <br>
<br>
One final thing - ID the item(s) on VhalSera. They come out pretty funny.<br>
<br>
If you the shrouded bats that lurk around here, once they are slain killed they spawn Enraged Vampires, which are very mean. <br>
Both mobs process Full Stamina Drain on there target, also the vampires cast many nasty spells including Grav Flux.<br>
<br>
Head up the bridge and proceed through either door, killing all the bats on the way. You will eventually get to a room with a Hand holding a ruby. <br>

The Seventh Floor:<br>
-------------------------<br>
This floor is basically a long black brick corridor. It turns, but there is only one route it can take. <br>
<br>
Traps Warning: <br>
There are some traps near the beginning when you come to a pillar (there is a trap on either side of the pillar). No idea what the trap does as rogue disarmed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every so often you will come to a drake, these can be pulled solo and were green at 52. <br>
<br>
After about 6 drakes you will come to a doorway on your left that opens to a large(ish) room with a spiral staircase in the middle, and about 6+ spawns around the room. Some of these were blue at 52. If you go up the staircase there are some rooms and a room of mirrors (I believe, warrior scouted). <br>
<br>
However, on the wall opposite where you came into the spiral staircase room is a banner, that is a fake wall. Walk through.<br>
<br>
You will now be in a smallish corridor. It has 4 rooms coming directly off it, one on the left, then one on the right, left then right. At the end is a small circular area where nothing spawns. In each of the 4 rooms a bat spawns, when you kill these there is a chance that the boss of the zone, Tserrina, will spawn.<br>
<br>
Tserrina is level 50, and totally magic resistant. NOTHING would stick to her when we fought her. She blinds, and I heard that she charms sometimes.<br>
<br>
Hint: when we fought her she ran, and because we couldn't get snare to stick she ran back into the spiral staircase room where there was a full spawn =) Managed to kill her tho before we had to evac. I highly suggest you keep that first room clear as you work your way through the 4 bats.<br>
<br>
The Mirror Out<br>
<br>
There are serveral mirrors out in the room with many mirrors.<br>

<br>
And if you don't have the spell yet, chances are good you'll pick it up on your way up to the 7th floor.<br>
<br>
Also, Tserrina drops a 'master key' that uses the left-hand mirror on floor one. It ports the group to a mirror room (I think on the 7th floor). It has 6 mirrors around the room; each one supposedly leads to one of the other floors directly. My group needs to experiment with this a bit more to figure out which mirrors go where.<br>

<br>
AOEs. Scary eh but you be amazed how effective AOEs are in here. Standard group I am usually with is a 54 druid, 50 wizard, 53 cleric and 2-4 variety of classes (I am 55 Shaman). We actually move rapidly thru the tower from 1 - 4 in record time (have keys, do not waste time slaughtering all before us, blah blah blah..heh). The bottleneck we found to 5th floor where the fun is (btw recommend 4th floor for excellent hunting from mid 30's to mid 40's) is on the 4th floor at the point where you come across 4-6 mobs all together. Pretty hard to single pull them and they tend to have a high agro radius. Usually we just tried to fight thru them with group taking damage from them and having major downtime after fight. Now here I give credit to Brairwolf, the 54 Druid, for coming up with AOEs. Basically he used Upheavel along with the cleric. The wizard would toss her point blank AOE after too to mop up. My god it was gross. The usual long fight was over in 1 min. Next place we found AOEs great for was the wedding. The wedding party per se (not bride/groom) do not agro you. You can move up to them w/o a care. Again here have 2-3 people crank AOEs and you can take down most if not all 8 zombie mobs there. Frankly AOEs are effective in the tower and I do recommend you use them. Just make sure 2 people are doing AOES so agro is not all built up on one person.<br>
