<br>
I beseech you all to petition and feedback in game about how wrong Verant has made the cleric epic final part. <br>
<br>
Basically it boils down to this...Verant split the final portion of the epic where you used to have to camp Sol B to get Zordak in Human form to spawn after Naggy had been put down...You would have to usually camp at least 2 to 3 days sometimes more just for your turn at Zordak as long as patch or Naggy didn't spawn and kick you out if you over 52...otherwise Naggy ate yas. This camp time did not include the camp time you had to spend with cleric before you in line. Prexus was honoring the camp as long as you were in zone and in line.<br>
<br>
After the patch the Wednesday before last, they moved Zordak in Sol B to an easier location but didn't really change spawn time as they had stated in patch message. It took the cleric before me a little over 3 days and it took me 79 hours and 30 minutes. The Sol B Zordak was just Human merchant that trades old pearl (was old trigger piece) for a new swirling pearl.  Zordak poofs as he gives you pearl and says he will return from Skyfire to kill blah blah blah...So then off to Skyfire where the new aggro version of 55 Zordak merchant spawns...He aggros on anyone that gets too close and has kinda large aggro range from reports. Once killed he spawns into Ragefire (fire dragon like Naggy with same loot). Kill Rage and get Naggy random loots plus new last piece for epic...Zordak's heart container that is just no drop. You must then place swirling pearl into container and combine for Zordak Heart which must then be turned in to Omat in TD. Omat give cleric final orb...3 orbs then make clicky stick...56 rezzer.<br>
<br>
The ugliness has already started...Only three clerics had swirling pearl when I wrote this message. Dourgas (stasis) managed to stay on camp after he completed Sol B part...Early Friday morning around 3am...Dourgas killed and got container...combined into heart...yeah Dourgas!  Glorund (Southern Armada) and I weren't bothering to camp yet.  This Glorund was a little burned by 200+ hours in his hell camp and I had to work in RL not to mention get some sleep.  Glorund had posted on Prexus that he was planning to camp this weekend and I was planning on going away for the weekend so no prob there.  Problem is a cleric has decided since no cleric was there after Dourgas killed Rage that she would camp SF even though she has no swirling pearl ready to combine.  Some might say well she is just gathering parts for her epic well let me put it this way...Anyone can loot this container in SF as is now.  A level 1 cleric from an uber guild could plop is ass down and camp...call uber guild in for strike and loot container...as cleric is just collecting pieces for epic. This cleric told me she was camping because Verant's poor programming has allowed her to do this.  What a weak minded answer...<br>
<br>
This is so wrong to clerics who are doing raid in order and have spent countless hours in Sol B already. Verant has now made the one old hell camp into 2 hell camps with a FCFS setup in the making. This container must be made NO RENT as a start...Another better change would be to make Zordak triggerable like druids Fay... ie Give the swirling pearl to human Zordak in SF...he gives back and Ragefire spawns to try and eat you...like Fay. Lastly and least preferable would be to also remove all dragon loot except NO RENT container. <br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with having to camp in line with epic ready clerics on last piece. A no rent container would almost assure this to be the case. Please tell your friends and ask them to let thier guilds know we must stop this FCFS mentality before it makes for more chaos and hate in the game.  Have them flood /feedback channels with demands that Verant make changes....Petition and ask GMs why they aren't fixing this problem before it really gets ugly. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and I hope I didn't rant too much but yes Baggy is upset by this...<br>

<br>
Please contact Verant and register your concerns.  This is not good.<br>
<br>
A cleric is currently in skyfire camping the spawn and does not have the pearl..sigh...FCFS Zordak...sigh<br>
<br>
Not fair to Glorund and to Bagst imo.<br>
<br>
But i guess that cleric thinks because Verant set it up this way and it can be done, she will do it.  Needless to say it is a stasis cleric..sigh....The attitude is if i can i will.  Not thinking of fairness to other clerics on the server who put in the time.<br>
<br>
I think it is an outrage that people who have not done that camp to saunter into skyfire and try to take Zordak.  Any cleric can walk into skyfire, organize a raid and take him down now.  It is not fair to those clerics who turned in their pearls for a new one and done that part of the camp at all. <br>
<br>
This engages the cutthroat, the negative side of human natures, the give me attitude, the i don't care about anyone else, i want ....not what we want for prexus.   i don't think.<br>
<br>
I know Glorund and Bagst has done the time and the work.  They have earned the shot at Zordak and the epic.  This other person has not.  <br>
<br>
I believe the thought behind an epic, is that the person has earned rights to it by the effort it calls forth. <p><center>

You don't like it....tough.<br>
<br>
As of when verant put in the new zordak it made it so that no order was needed so u can do it as and when you can.<br>
<br>
Face it the old way of doing zordak is finished....adapt and overcome.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest prexus has had zordak easy anyway...<br>
<br>
At least the most people have had to worry about was getting people together to kill the mob,on other servers you would of been watching for other raid groups coming in to steal the mob from you once its spawned. <p><img src="http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/eq/sig01.jpg"

<br>
The only reason VI changed it was because people were losing too much should someone come and kill zordak once the pearl had been handed in.<br>
<br>
That is the the only reason they changed it,not to save the poor clerics sitting on their asses for hours on end. <p><img src="http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/eq/sig01.jpg"

I had thought doing the turn-in spawned the killable version in SF. However VI says the killable version spawns entirely independently of the turn in one. Which means this is now 2 entirely different camps. Doesnt sound like fun to me. Would say I'm glad I'm doing the enchanter epic cept almsot a year later I still dont have that #$%^$%^ shissar head to complete it. But this isn't my rant. I hope Prexus players can come to an amicable agreement that everyone will stick to (ie only level 50plus clerics camping the killable version, etc).

<br>
When these systems collapsed, very few people put their reputations, in-game dealings and loot at risk. Now the server is completely FCFS.<br>
<br>
The server has gotten what it asked for. I don't think any mob will be &quot;campable&quot; from now on. <br>
<br>
And personally, I find it very hypocritical that people who advocated the FCFS in the first place should try to keep this mob campable. Stick to one system or the other. <br>

Obviously if a cleric isnt even close to ready they shouldnt be doing this part of the camp and I can understand peoples worries about that. But who would really bother sitting in Skyfire for so long if they wont even be able to get the epic after? And while Im not a prexus uberguild ass kisser I really honestly would hope that the guilds we consider &quot;uber&quot; would have enough respect and conciounce(sp) not to support one of their twinkies camping of Skyfire zordak without them being the appropriate level and length through their epic.<br>
<br>
 If enough people raise enough of a fuss I think the easiest and least problematic solution would just be to require you to hand in your new pearl from Sol B zordak into Skyfire zordak to get him pissed off and attack you. I really dont see why they needed to make two camps for this one pearl. I never thought of VI as being that psycho about some of their crappy epic storylines but whatever.<br>

And as for this change making the Zordak situation better... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> open your eyes</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. The cleric epic is easy except for zordak, that's right. <br>
<br>
I'd rather do the entire epic over 3 times than to sit camping zordak for mm... lemme see... 245 hours it is now. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=34898" target="new">Inspect Glorund</a> - <a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/fthew0rmholefrm1.showMessage?topicID=1.topic" target="new">View Glorund's Trades</a><br><img src="http://thew0rm.homestead.com/files/GlowormSig.jpg" border="0"><img src="http://thew0rm.homestead.com/files/worm6.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bprexus95980.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=taleusramar>Taleus Ramar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/4/02 6:56:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=909.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ..</span><hr size=1> &quot;the Nightmare has just begun&quot;<br>

Sure, I can understand camping him before say, the Ixiblat for example, but I don't see why SolB should be done before SF.  Personally, I'm going to be trying for the SF Zordak before I try to do the SolB one, and would encourage others to do the same.  No sense spending 70 some odd hours camping a mob (SolB) before you get the other half (SF) from a mob you don't have to camp.  It's pretty much how everyone does it, hammer out the parts that are quicker before tackling the ones that take a lot of time.<br>

This is the only way that the clerics on Prexus will be happy.  Note that it is thier right to complain that the new bottle neck is ixiblat and may wish to have that removed at some point further.<br>
<br>
Verant took a very serious concern and removed it from the cleric epic, and they did it in a way that somewhat makes sence at least.  As for the length of camp that is dependent on how often they want epics added to each server, but at least that time is not dependent on a mob that 99% of the clerics at this point in their epic quest cannot even help to take down.  As for the other issues, why does everyone think that they &quot;need&quot; or &quot;deserve&quot; thier epics?  If you are crazy enough to sit for weeks in a zone to wait for a mob to spawn that gives you a head start to gather the people to kill it.  Keep in mind that the longer you leave that mob up the more you are restricting all clerics behind you.  This is more of a concern in my eyes then someone gathering their friends a bit faster.  I have lost the oportunity to kill epic mobs due to the fact that it takes people hours to gather and kill a mob, thus putting the respawn time into the hours I am at work.  When this happened I was so mean that I left the zone and then when they got the peice they were after I congratulated them, I appologize for my rudeness, next time I will ignore the fact that they are sitting at the zone line and go kill the mob with the 4 people I ported in with me.  I am respectful but people complaining non-stop about how they &quot;deserve&quot; something more and how the &quot;ubers&quot; cheat them out of their epic wears awful thin.<br>
<br>
BTW, I have missed all the complaints regarding how the planes have gone FFA and everyone is training each other in hate.  Please tell me that all the doomsayers were right and that happens on a daily basis cause I have been in fear 5 days or more each week and it is almost always empty of players and full of mobs.  I know Trakanon has been an evil mad dash of guilds trying to wipe each other out.<br>
