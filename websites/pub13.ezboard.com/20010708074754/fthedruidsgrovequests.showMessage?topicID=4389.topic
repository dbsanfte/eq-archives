Number one, you need more people. Lots and Lots of tanks, when you think you have enough, invite some more lol, the higher the better.<br>
I had mages at the hidden oasis CoH my raid to the staging area.<br>
Fire and Magic resists if you can get them near 150 you are golden.<br>
Have your MT sit next to you when you turn in your Froglok essence, everyone else should be standing, casters near the tunnel, Tanks at the wall behind the dwarf. Faydedar will aggro anyone who sits  and run toward the ramp with the huts.<br>
Faydedars AE is hits harder than named in Western Wastes, I may have had a bit of overkill but I counted 70 in the zone for my raid and Fay was dead pretty quickly.<br>
Have a cleric as well as a backup druid/shaman in each group, druids should chain cast FR if it is dispelled.<br>
Just have your casters move up to cast and step back to get out of the AE and get healed...<br>
I fight in the TD and have seen many Faydedar raids go down in flames. You need more people (I have seen raids with over 40 members go down fast).<br>
Hope this helps, not everyone may do it the same way, but it worked for me.<br>

<br>
As far as I can figure, here's what you have to do:<center><br>
<img src="http://web2.airmail.net/naomi/temp/fay.jpg"><br>
Please note that the scale very off.  And the Erudite NPC's are represented by ratmen because... well because I didn't have any Erudites in my EQ screenshots.</center><br>
<br>
You can have a monk "pull" both the Erudites so they're as far away from the beach as possible, then FD and log out to clear aggro.  This didn't seem to make that much of a difference to me though, Fay's AE seemed to catch them no matter where they were.<br>
<br>
Have your tanks "meet" Faydedar on the beachhead, keep your casters and healers over to the extreme corner.  Move the tanks back toward the "bowl" entrance as the battle progresses.  Let your tanks do /ooc's or /shouts of Fay's current health to alert the casters on when to nuke.  As for the clerics, the only thing I can figure is that they have to stay mobile - running in and out of Fay's AE range as they heal.  A fear'd cleric doesn't do anyone much good.  If you stand on top of Faydedar (right behind his head) it doesn't seem like his AE will catch you since his AE is a cone based - starting from his mouth out.  However, if he changes targets, he may get you.  If you can find the "sweet spot" you can have a cleric group heal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upeyotie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Peyotie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/22/01 7:11:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on Faydedar tactics</span><hr size=1> Actually we had about 18 people with their resist gear and it went flawless. The only two people that died were enchanters who were buffing tanks with haste when we pulled. A simple bad timing thing. We pulled Faydedar WAY over into the corner. You want to get him as far away from the other NPCs as possible. In the above map where it says casters...put everybody. Pack them in a little group and smack him down. I don't know why people are having problems with him. He's one of the easiest dragons in the game.<br>

The last time I had 30 ppl and we finally took him down. <br>
<br>
The question I have is setting up for the raid. It seems that Faydedar likes our clerics and caster alot.  I have tried placing all the caster in the far corner with the tanks along the beach to aggro him when he comes out of the water.  He totally ignored the tanks who were taunting him and went straight to my casters and attacked them.  I have also tried placing caster near the tunnel and again he went straigt for them, ignoring tanks.  It seems no matter where the casters are placed Fay would go straight for them and ignore the tanks.<br>
<br>
Is this normal?  The casters weren't casting or doing anything, just standing there waiting on the tanks to pull him.  It makes killing him a little hard when he tkaes out one of your clerics even before the fight starts.<br>

Wow, I play on a PvP server and that would be impossible unless the mob drops a dozen fungi's.  Fay spawned in the small tunnel for us? Weird, maybe it ran there.  24 is doable with a slower, chanter, 3-4 clerics and at least 6-7 tanks 55+.  Mixed group of 30 should be able to do it.  We died the first time because it agro'd on the casters first and we had no idea what we were doing, 2nd time he fell.  Wasn't too hard if you know what's going on but not easy either.<br>

I got my pod last night and the way we did this was have everyone gather together around Faydedar. We fought in about the spot marked casters on that diagram. Basically tanks are in close to Faydedar and casters are just outside them. Basically 2 circles. My theory on this is get your fire resist as high as possible and deal with the AoE damage that way, don't try and get out of range of it. Cause as I said &quot;ping pong&quot; is the worst thing you can do on Faydedar and is the reason that I have seen Faydedar attempts fail.<br>

We had Fay until it got mysteriously healed. I think we can rule out Fay's AE hit NPCs at inn because Fay was healed, not killed by them. Maybe someone from the fight that got too close to the inn was KOS to the 2 eruite and aggroed them. This still doesn't explain why Fay was healed... but buttom line is next time we need to put casters on opposite corner, like the one showing on the pic (rat man is nice touch, hehe). 24 was enough, we only had 2 slowers and neither managed to land slow before Fay aggroed on them or Fay would probably died even after it got healed. Next time we'll bring a few more shaman and mage to help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaslethalo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>maslethalo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/23/01 2:49:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on Faydedar tactics</span><hr size=1> Does Fay still drop all Kunark Dragon Loot, or has it been nerfed to just drop druid epic? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustormhaven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stormhaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/23/01 3:04:33 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web2.airmail.net/naomi/amalgam/forum/stormhaven.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question on Faydedar tactics</span><hr size=1> If you spawn him he only drops the druid epic parts.

Just last weekend I did Fay to finish my epic. It took me like 2hrs to put together my own force but with a lot of friends we were rdy. We had 12ppl total. Two 60 warriors and 3 clerics. I didnt have any experience with Fay so I was kinda just relying on common sense strategy and what I had read.<br>
<br>
We're finally prepped and rdy and I spawn Fay and the fight begins. I had forgotten a key point though, Fay needs to be pulled to the far right wall. So immediately I aggro the two goofy erudite dewds and I realize I'm fokked. So panic kicks in and out of no where our peeps start dying like mad, not too mention the two erudite npc's(one's red and other is blue) beating the @#%$ out of fay just drooling to poof the corpse.<br>
<br>
So more peeps start dropping, including the first one to go was one of our 60 warriors. Fay's at about 40 now and essentially I've given up becuz NPC's are gonna poof the corpse. Eventually I start lookin around and just about everyone is dead, Fay is at 20 now(Erudites still going full). At this point I have one of our clerics camp out cus I realize this @#%$ is doomed. So he camps and now Fay is at 10 and I realize that EVERYONE is dead except me and the 60 warrior(a really gud friend). Fay is still wailing on the warrior and I'm at 0.5mana. I heal the last I got and Fay shockingly gets down to 5 with just one guy on her(not to mention the two erudites). Well I know I'm fokked cus them dewds are gonna KS it.<br>
<br>
Fay starts running and the warrior just gives everything he gots, BOOM Fay down......&quot;You have gained party experience&quot; I ran as fast as I could, lewted the @#%$ and BAM we won. I was in total shock and couldnt believe it. After every fokk up in the world, somehow two guys managed to kill fay from 10percent and KS two erudite high lvl npc's. If I had of lost, of course it would of been gay. But with the way it turned out, it was a truly epic finish to me epic weapon =)<br>

I've only been on one fay run..  and it was successful..   give everyone this msg..
