<br>
<b>We are aware of the various macro programs that players are using to artificially level their characters. For those that aren't aware of these, macro programs "drive" your character around the world and fight monsters for you. <u>This is, of course, directly counter to our code of conduct, and we will be taking steps to stop macroing</u>, including taking action against those that are using it. Consider yourselves warned.</b><br>
<br>
Just as in the earlier <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showMessage?topicID=168.topic>thread about Alt-Tab</a>, I can't see how macroing is a violation of the user agreement, and think Mythic wouldn't be justified in banning people as they warn.  Macroing doesn't allow your character to do anything that you can't already do; you just don't have to be sitting in front of your monitor and physically be pressing the keys.  Also, macro programs do not modify the DAOC client at all, but rather insert keystrokes at the system level which DAOC later intercepts.  You can do the same thing at the hardware level using a <a href=http://www.monu-cad.com/keyboard.htm>programmable keyboard</a>.  Is hardware a violation of the user agreement too?  <img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/rolleyes.txt><br>
<br>
I also think Mythic is taking the wrong approach to this issue.  To quote Raph Koster's <a href=http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/laws.html>Laws of Online Game Design</a>:<br>
<br>
<b><i>Macroing, botting, and automation</i><br>
No matter what you do, someone is going to automate the process of playing your world.<br>
<br>
<i>Corollary</i>:<br>
Looking at what parts of your game players tend to automate is a good way to determine which parts of the game are tedious and/or not fun.</b><br>
<br>
(Raph Koster was the lead designer for Ultima Online and is now working on the Star Wars Galaxies project at Verant/SOE.)<br>
<br>
To use one example, trade skills in DAOC can get <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdarkageofcamelottradeskillsfrm1.showMessage?topicID=276.topic>very slow</a> and <a href=http://pub96.ezboard.com/fdarkageofcamelottradeskillsfrm1.showMessage?topicID=249.topic>tiring</a> at the higher skill levels.  Not only are skill gains less frequent, but the amount of time <i>per attempt</i> can easily be over 2 minutes, during which time you have to stand still.  Mythic would do well to read that corollary carefully, and instead of finding ways to punish macroers, they should find ways to make trade skills more interesting.<br>
<br>
The consignment system is a good start, but obviously if people are macroing and choosing powerskilling over consignments, that system doesn't offer enough benefits.  Yet, instead of making that system more robust, Mythic nerfed it by reducing the income potential.  How about making the consignment system a viable method of gaining experience as well as cash?  Or even giving other unique rewards to craftsmen who earn renown in NPC circles, such as a special title or quest-like item?<br>
<br>
I know that merely trying to punish macroing is not the way to approach it ... does anyone feel differently? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uericfate.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EricFate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/24/01 8:18:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well, I can see two problems.</span><hr size=1> First problem:<br>
<br>
How does it effect the overall economy if every time someone needs cash, they create an alt, give him some seed cash then let the &quot;Tailoring Consignment&quot; macro run for 36 hours straight?<br>
<br>
How did it effect the competition?  (Not EQ, as the tradeskill economy never existed to begin with.  I'm thinking more along the lines of UO.)<br>
<br>
Second Problem:<br>
<br>
How do you share a hunting ground with an automated player that wants to experience grind while sleeping?  You can't negotiate, you can't group, all you can do is try to work around them.  What happens if you have to share a hunting ground with twenty of them?  With two hundred of them?<br>
<br>
Want the answer?  Ask anyone who played Gemstone III after the second year.  (Or rather *tried* to play Gemstone.  Once you hit level seven or so, it was a virtual guarantee that you'd lose 2 out of every three kills to a script program.)<br>
<br>
I can see why using the User Agreement as a method of weeding folks who are number one on the &quot;most likely to quit after the free month&quot; checklist, (i.e. folks that don't have enough time to play to be satisfied with anything about their character), is being considered a viable solution.<br>
<br>
Is it a violation of the user agreement?  Hard to say.  Do I care?  No. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>DAOC Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/24/01 9:44:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, I can see two problems.</span><hr size=1> Agree with Eric.

Yay for Mythic for banning folks who get caught doing it (if you can do it without getting caught, more power to you I guess) only because this game doesn't need to turn into a single player game that we all pay for monthly. <p><b><font size=3 color=0066FF>Salicia Swiftfoot</b><br></font><font size=2 color=red><i>Theurgist to the Stars</i></font><br><font size=3 color=0066FF><b>Galahad Server<br>DAoC Moderator for <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Unknown</span><br><font color=#333399>(12/24/01 12:47:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Unknown</span><hr size=1> (This post is missing and can not be restored) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueckointhedarkness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ecko in the darkness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/24/01 8:29:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, I can see two problems.</span><hr size=1>   I can not have an opinion on this with out having tried these Macros. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A> at: 12/25/01 4:21:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uvoodooman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Voodooman</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/deleteThreadFire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(12/26/01 5:49:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=236.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Well, I can see two problems.</span><hr size=1> Its not really fair, but I'd prefer that not every idiot kid out there can get a lvl 800 crafter overnight.  May as well just go out and buy toons on ebay while you're at it, as you're doing nothing, just simply having it given to you.<br>
<br>
Also what is gold actually worth in this game at present.  So much great gear is just given away, the economy is by far the most loose one in any MMORPG yet.  What can you spend money on?  Dye, Siege weapons, umm outfiting new chars in gear... not much else.  (But this is a whole other topic)<br>
<br>
I'd really question how well these programs would work about lvl 20.<br>
<br>
How would they avoid Aggresive mobs in most hunting areas around these levels, and the exp would be so slow it'd take honestly 5-10x as long as if you were to group.  <br>
<br>
And then the higher you get the more impossible in my opinion it would be to solo mobs. <br>
<br>
Another wrinkle, what if you want a caster... <br>
<br>
I'm not from AC but I just don't see it really working well over level 20.  <br>
<br>
Overall I think Mythic would be better to tweak grouping/PLing code, as I would rather have people twinked or atleast powerlvled then I would a sh*tty script get them to the top.  <br>
<br>
And I mean if you had a 50th lvl tank showing you the ropes don't you think you'd catch on faster then if you had someone near your own level.  <br>
<br>
Bring back decent group exp :( <p><div align="center"><img src="http://members.home.net/pauldittrich/dee.jpg">
