<br>
<br>
         The Fearless Five take Cazic Thule<br>
              By: Garrdor Earthdancer<br>
<br>
<br>
  Anabasis ran, trying not to trip over her robe. Rinulin was not far behind. The Lizardmen were very quick and agile, but Rinulin had transferred the spirit of wolf into everyone before the battle. Veric was ahead of everyone. Seeing that his Spirit of Wolf was exiting his body, he tuned around and readied his bow. He wielded the Trueshot Longbow…Handed down to him by the gods. He knocked an arrow, Pulled back the golden string and released, projecting the arrow a hundred feet and into the forehead of an unlucky lizardman. The Lizard fell back with a thump, no pain, just death…Veric ran down near the temple's zone entrance, a shady tunnel, and saw that the others had not arrived. Just before Veric went off to search for his friends, he heard a noise behind him. A lizard pounced in his direction. Veric ducked with great agility. The Lizard flew over his head and tumbled into the soil ahead. The lizard got up. Veric gave it a cold glare. &quot;Radiant…&quot; Veric whispered. For some reason, Veric did not like this certain Lizardman. Veric unsheathed his blades from his sides. He wielded The Crystalline Blade, which he found of a magical goblin many years ago in an arctic dungeon, and his friend, The Short Sword of Morin. Radiant peered at Veric's legendary blades, then decided it was not such a good idea. Radiant turned around and attempted to flee. Radiant found itself on the ground after smacking into a giant blue legplate. Radiant gazed upwards and looked into the furious Barbarian's eyes. Garrdor. Garrdor swung his huge axe down vertically to Radiant's head. Radiant dodged, ran through Garrdor's legs and fled into the Courtyard of the great temple. A flash of color stuck Radiant's eyes as he stopped in its tracks, clearly stunned. Halleck sat down, quite pleased with his work. Halleck signaled Rinulin and Anabasis to do their jobs. Anabasis packed a fireball in her palms still holding a smile on her face, no stress, and no fatigue. She threw the fireball at Radiant's legs. Radiant's left leg flew off its body and into Halleck's lap. Halleck snapped out of meditation. &quot;What is this?! Anabasis, please! Im trying to meditate! Can you find a cleaner way to do that?!&quot; Halleck snapped. Anabasis giggled and did it again, blowing Radiant's right hand off. The hand flew through the air and landed upon Halleck's skull. Halleck stood up, Interupted again. &quot;Ana!…nevermind. I'll be meditating.&quot; Halleck said with a smile. Rinulin created a larger orb in the center of his hands. Almost like he was palming a basketball. The orb lit in flames as Rinulin hurled it at Radiant, trying to hop away on its other leg. The blast only left Radiant with a torso and head. And one arm intact. Radiant still moved, trying to pull itself to a rusty sword that was on the ground ten yards from it. Radiant started to drag itself with it's one arm. &quot;Stop right there.&quot; Rinulin said in a clear, calm voice. Rinulin kicked Radiant over onto its back with ease. Radiant spit on Rinulins leg. &quot;One day, my brood will kill you and your children and thrust your heads on spikes to display at this temple!&quot; Radiant gurgled with his reptilian voice. Rinulin smiled and said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot; Rinulin signaled everyone to turn his or her heads. Rinulin pulled his mace from his belt. The mace was long and the head of it was as big as a grapefruit. Rinulin smiled and used two hands to swing the mace down into Radiant's face. Anabasis and the others turned around. Ana climbed up and sat on a damaged wagon so she could see the sight of victory. She inspected the land around her. A score of steaming corpses covered the courtyard. &quot;We stay here tonight. We see if we can pull it off, hold em' back.&quot; Everyone nodded. <br>
<br>
  Halleck put on some leather gloves and started pulling the corpses of Lizards into a pile. Halleck also was wearing plastic around his robe. He did not like the smell either. He would rather get in Rinulin's legendary headlock. Nobody liked that. Even though he does not squeeze hard, It's the fact that the person is under Rinulin's arm! Just the thought of that strikes fear into the hearts of many Norathians. Halleck casted a spell and rained fire down on the pile, starting a huge bonfire. It was dark; the party would rather stay in this damned temple than going outside of it, into the jungles of Feerrott. Whoever attempted to cross the Feerrott never came back. Some say that they have seen men dressed in full black robes that levitate chop people in half with their gigantic scythes. Nobody goes in the Feerrott during night. The five all sat around the campfire. Garrdor sat closest to the fire, with his horned helm by his side. Rinulin and Anabasis started &quot;cooking.&quot; They summoned food that fell into their hands out of thin air. These two and Halleck were worshiped by most mortal Norathians, as they borrow food from the gods. They feasted under the young Norathian night sky, a blanket of black, a starless sky. Halleck wondered how close they were to another planet out there in the blanket. Many eyes were spying the five on. Rinulin knew that there were Lizardmen about, but did not do anything about it, since the residents in the courtyard meant no harm. The ones further were the evil ones. The group watched in disgust as Garrdor ate meal after meal, draining all of the three's mana. Then he started feasting on a lizard's corpse. Garrdor gobbled up several corpses before he turned over to Veric and said &quot;Are you gonna eat that?&quot; &quot;My berries…no, no. You can have em pal…I have seemed to have lost my appetite for some reason.&quot; Veric said as Garrdor snatched a bunch of berries from Veric's bowl. &quot;That's odd.&quot; Garrdor said with his dumb, (65 wisdom), voice. Garrdor did not have a clue on sarcasm and what it was supposed to mean. Garrdor dropped the berries to the ground, stood up, put his helm on and peered behind the group. The group saw Garrdor and they all stood up, dropping their food aside. A line of about fourteen Lizardmen stood there. They had leather vests on and Fine Steel weapons. These were the &quot;Elite&quot; Lizardman guards. &quot;Chargeee!&quot; the Lizardman Sentinel said as all of the guards ran, leaping at Garrdor. It took seven of them to knock Garrdor down, since he was about 7'0…300lb. The guards desperately tried to pound through Garrdor's blue armor. It was futile to do so…since the armor was made of the strongest materials in Norrath. The armor was given to him by the Elders of Norrath, the Elder White Wolfs. The guild consisted of a great mix of Immortals<br>
<br>
  Arclan, the leader of the White Wolfs, he watches over all of his deciples and plays the ref most of the time. Sinjjon, the thinker, Is the most political and wise of the guild. Bahkal is second leader, wise and strong like Arclan. Hadwin, Copeland, and Geander, Are the backbone of the guild. No mana, just brute, powerful melee combat. They wield the finest blades in all of Norrath. Cabbage, Redlance, Danii, Kindian, and Senadin are the main frontline persons of the guild. They are all druids, masters of nature and magic. All of them together are merely unstoppable. Fumarie, Ryen, Bassalt, and Jabs. All are great dungeon hunters; making sure to sweep the land with order and bringing death to those whom oppose the White Wolfs. Ylyrra, the greatest monk and friend of the White Wolfs fell in a battle that shook the heavens. Bahkal came very close too. She now watches over the White Wolfs, letting no harm fall upon them. As she is now a godess. There are many more in this guild. Many other greats to be mentioned. But let's get back to the story<br>
<br>
  Garrdor grabbed a Lizardman and hurled it into a wall, killing it instantly. He grabbed another Lizard and smashed it against his blue breastplate. Instant death there too, as Garrdor could lift a mammoth calf with his brute power. Veric blitzed and leaped into the air, drawing his swords in mid air. He landed in front of a lizard and slashed it across the waist. Veric put his swords away and kicked the lizard's lower body from under it. A lizardman grinned and leaped upon Anabasis, mouth first, swallowing her whole. The lizard that swallowed her ran at Garrdor, then stopped. It burped a large flame then exploded! Parts flew everywhere and Anabasis flew out of the Lizardman, unharmed. She did know how to use those fireballs! A Lizard ran at Halleck. Halleck sighed as he pulled his wand from his robe and closed one eye. He threw the wand an astonishing speed and smacked the Lizard right in the forehead. Instant death as well. The wand went into its forehead. Halleck walked over to the corpse and pulled the wand out, poured a flask of water on it, then placed it in his belt pouch. <br>
<br>
  The Lizardmen's leader, the Sentinel, stood there eyeing the five that distinguished his army like they were fire beetles. It snarled and withdrew a Fine Steel Rapier. An arrow pierced through its chest and made it fly back and pin to a wall. Veric was quite pleased with the kill. Anabasis signaled Rinulin to lift her up to the lizard that was stuck to the wall. She drew a dagger and sliced it across the neck.<br>
<br>
  Veric said, &quot; Lets find a safe place to slowly kill the guards…like my hideout!&quot; &quot;Sounds good!&quot; Halleck said. The group ran through the courtyard, not even putting out their big bonfire. They opened a wooden door and began traversing many tunnels and hallways. A maze it was, as only Veric knew the way. The got to a dead end. Veric sat under a torch nearby. The corner known as Verics Corner was filled with nuts and berries of any kind, even water flasks and bottles of red wine. Anabasis made her way over to the stash of goodies, moving her feet rapidly under her robe, making her look like she glided over the ground. She started picking up all the loot and started stuffing it in her bags. &quot;Stay here.&quot; Veric said as he got up and ran off into the dark hallways. Veric ran his way to a room full of guards. &quot;Too many&quot; Veric whispered under his breath. A Lizardman Guard heard him and yelled for help. &quot;INCOMING!&quot; Veric screamed as he traversed the maze once again, with speed and agility of a cat. The guards were just as fast. Veric ran back to the group and turned around, withdrawing his bow. He drew back the loaded string and released, sending an arrow through two Lizard's chests, pinning them together. The other eighteen Lizards still charged. Garrdor unsheathed his gigantic Executioners Axe and shouted &quot;Come get some!&quot; in Barbarian. He swung the axe horizontally, slicing one Lizardman across the waist. Its upper body fell to the ground and its legs ran over to Anabasis. Anabasis stuck out her staff and tripped the lower body of the lizard. She began to beat the legs with her fists. Another Lizardman ran after Garrdor. Garrdor stuck out his massive size 23 foot and let the Lizardman run into it, crushing it's chest in. One lizard knocked Garrdor's horned helmet off and onto the ground. Another lizard jumped at Garrdor, slashing it's dagger across Garrdor's throat. Garrdor dropped his axe, reached for his neck and fell to his knees, and then rolled to his side. Rinulin shouted aloud, and shot a blue beam from his hands at Garrdor's throat, replacing the blood loss and closing the wound. Garrdor got up, grabbed his axe and continued fighting. Anabasis was blasting lizards left and right, blowing them in many pieces and disabling them. Veric was getting beat up pretty bad by the mob of angry lizards. But Rinulin kept healing and healing. A lizard sprang upon Anabasis. While it was in mid air, It noticed it made a mistake, as Anabasis held her staff up with two hands, bracing herself. The Lizardman impaled itself on the staff, dead. Halleck memorized a spell of mass destruction and stood up, eager and ready. &quot;Get back here all! Get by me!&quot; Halleck shouted as Garrdor and Veric blitzed to his side. Halleck swooped his hand over the room, all the Lizard's eyes turned black as the all panicked and ran into the walls. Rinulin casted a spell and made roots come up from the ground and entwine between the Lizards, snaring them. Halleck's eyes turned white as he rolled up his sleeves and began chanting a spell. A red cloud shot from his hands and levitated over the Lizardmen. The lizardmen looked up at the ceiling, seeing the cloud that would bring them death. Halleck shot lightening into the clouds as the clouds started to rumble and rained a hail of fireballs onto the Lizards, burning them alive. Once all was ash, Halleck's eyes turned normal and he fell to the ground, as he was sapped of power. He got in the meditating position and went into a semi-sleep. Garrdor picked up his helmet and helped Anabasis retrieve her staff from the lizardman she had impaled. Everyone was tired and did not want to fight anymore. They all fell asleep in a large pile. <br>
<br>
The next morning they awoke, and stretched. &quot;Lets check the courtyard&quot; Anabasis said as she followed Veric and the group outside the tunnels. There was only corpses and ash. Norrath's sun shown brightly until a large figure shrouded it. They all looked up, The Avatar of Fear. It stood taller than Garrdor. Garrdor said &quot;let me handle this.&quot; As he strutted over to the ten foot tall Lizard. Garrdor swung a fist at the Avatar. The Avatar cought his fist, then used his other arm to backhand Garrdor, hitting him in the chest and flinging him fifty yards and through a brick wall of a nearby building. Garrdor got up, and ran to the group, then collapsed. Veric roared and leaped at the Avatar. The avatar caught Veric in mid air and flung him twenty feet up in the air and down face first in the dirt. Veric got up, wiped the blood from his nose and pulled back the string on his bow and released, sending an arrow at the Avatar. The arrow bounced off its tough skin. Halleck blasted the Avatar as it laughed with a deep voice and threw a stone at Halleck, knocking him onto his bottom. Anabasis screamed &quot;RUN!&quot; and all that had fallen got up. Rinulin casted a spell and vines shot up from the ground and entangled the beast. &quot;Lets go!&quot; Rinulin yelled as they ran out the front door of the temple. The Avatar stood at the entrance and roared as the five blitzed into the Feerrott, safe. They all ran through the swamps of Innothule after they got through the Feerrott. They made it all the way to the desert. A day later they found the great Oasis of Marr, where many lived. The five saluted each other and ran off their own way. Although they did not take the temple, they survived the night there. <br>
<br>
