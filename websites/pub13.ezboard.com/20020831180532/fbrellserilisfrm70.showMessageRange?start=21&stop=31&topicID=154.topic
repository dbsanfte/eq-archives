<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/planes.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...planes.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
A council of six masked beings known as The Tribunal, or the Six Hammers for their massive golden gavels, rule over the bleak landscape of endless gray plains and massive prison structures that is the Plane of Justice. All manner of sentient creatures that have committed unspeakable crimes are condemned to serve sentences within the impenetrable walls of the planar prisons, watched over by hooded servants of the Six Hammers.<br>
<br>
The mortals of Norrath whom worship The Tribunal claim that the Six Hammers sit eternally in the Court of Justice, perpetually passing judgment on the creatures brought before them by a being known only as The Seventh Hammer. It is this Seventh Hammer that acts as the messenger and bailiff to The Tribunal, and it is said that he is the only sentient creature that can stand before the immortal judges and he himself not be judged.<br>

<br>
I reckon that the zones in the expansion will probably be: <br>
<br>
4 Planes of Power: <br>
- Plane of Fire (Fennin Ro) <br>
- Plane of Air (Xegony) <br>
- Plane of Earth (Rathe Council) <br>
- Plane of Water (Tarew Marr, E'ci &amp; Povar) <br>
<br>
11 Planes of the 11 player-selectable Gods that aren't ingame yet (with Innoruuk's Hate, Cazic-Thule's Fear, Tunare's Growth, Bristlebane's Mischief and Veeshan's Sky already ingame this covers all 16 player gods): <br>
- Plane of Disease (Bertoxxulous) - confirmed on official website <br>
- Plane of Underfoot (Brell) - will probably connect to the unused zone in The Hole <br>
- Plane of Storms (Karana) <br>
- Plane of Love (Erollisi Marr) <br>
- Plane of Valor (Mithaniel Marr) <br>
- Plane of Oceans? (Prexus) <br>
- Plane of Tranquility (Quellious) - confirmed on official website - no combat so quest-only zone? <br>
- Plane of Healing? (Rodcet Nife) <br>
- Plane of Flame (Solusek Ro) - confirmed on official website <br>
- Plane of Justice (The Tribunal) - confirmed on official website <br>
- Plane of War (Rallos Zek plus his sons Tallon, Vallon and Sullon) - might zone from Kael /shrug <br>
<br>
1 demi-plane (per Planes of Power website): <br>
- Plane of Nightmares (Terris Thule) - confirmed on official website <br>
<br>
2 Planar cities: <br>
- New Tanaan, Plane of Knowledge (Druzzil Ro's plane of magic?) - confirmed on official website <br>
- City/Plane of the Fallen/Forsaken (Zebuxoruk, the Ungod) - mentioned in the background on the official website - supposed to be a city of paladins, SKs and clerics that have been abandoned by their gods <br>
<br>
This would still leave 6 demi-planes unaccounted for: Music (Ayonae Ro), Pain (Saryrn), Dreams (Morell Thule), Greed (Torvonillous), Madness (Vazaelle) and Shadow (Luclin). <br>
<br>
- Gil <br>
<br>
Giliad / Adrik / Quiss / Ogvar / Mogg <br>
56 dru / 50 war / 50 mnk / 45 rog / 35 shd <br>

Planes of Power is a true 'all content' expansion.  It's primary aim is to provide more content to the high end gamers of EverQuest, whilst still adding some new functionality to improve gameplay for those high level gamers who may not have always been in the uberest of guilds.<br>
<br>
Shawn Lord, a game-designer from SOE, walked us through the demonstration.<br>
<br>
&quot;One of the great things about Planes of Power is that it will once again bring back the ability to form pick-up groups and 6 person groups and still be able to engage in raid level encounters...while there will still be encounters tailored to the current system of en-masse or large guild raids, we are trying hard to make the new high level content as accessible to players as we can.&quot;<br>
<br>
What does this mean to your average EQ'ers?  Let me tell you.  First of all at least every starting city and the nexus will get a 'click' teleporter to the Plane of Tranquility.  This is one of two non-combat zones, the other being the Plane of Knowledge.  Within the Plane of Tranquility you will be able to also 'click' teleport to any other Planar zone in the expansion, provided you have passed the initiation requirements.<br>
<br>
&quot;Initiation Requirements?  Is this going to be Ssra all over again?&quot; I asked the demonstration team.  They responded with the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;Timesinks will not be as bad as they were in the Luclin expansion.  Characters will continue to advance in power as they work their way through the Planes.  Each Planar zone will have requirements but many of these may have multiple paths.  Players will be able to choose: Do I want to do a serious of involved quests or do I want to work on killing the boss mobs.  It won't always be that straightforward but there will be options for players.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is a definite story line in Planes of Power&quot;, says Shawn, &quot;you will begin to see that more and more as you start to play the expansion&quot;.<br>
<br>
So what happens if you wipe out inside a Planar zone that no-one else you know is initiated to help you CR with?  Well to alleviate this a new concept of 'Graveyards' are being introduced.  If a corpse remains unlooted in a Plane for a certain amount of time it will warp back to the entrance area where the Graveyard is located.<br>
<br>
&quot;How long will this time be?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it won't be immediate, we understand people don't want their corpse warping before the end of a fight.  It's something we'll balance out, but we'll probably leave enough time so that there is a small window of opportunity to get a res once the corpse has warped to the Graveyard&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We would be really excited to see more people going back into random 6 man groups and socializing more&quot; says Robert Fister from SOE, &quot;we are going to make sure that the travel to the Planes and then the adventure within them is designed in a way that this is possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
I asked about the rumors concerning items which will not work outside of the Planes.  Shawn responded &quot;We will definitely be taking advantage of situational items.  Items which work best, or only, in certain encounters.  But we also realize that people need and deserve items that they can use all the time.  So you will see both in the end.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not on display at the demonstration was the new particle and spell effect system which will also be in the expansion.  &quot;This is really the only major technical advancement we'll have, other than that we are really focusing on content&quot; says Shawn.  The new effects engine will be shown via screenshots and trailers in a few months, it will be the first upgrade to this engine since the games release back in 1999.<br>
<br>
Overall the expansion is looking very good, the team is re-introducing some of the fundamentals which excited players in their Level 1 - 35 days and taking them to the next level.  It should be a fun time once it hits the shelves in late 2002.<br>

The Planes of Power  will initially be a linear experience for players. The designers are making sure to give this expansion pack a lot of context and story, to give players a better sense of purpose. When they step into the planes for the first time--these are otherworldly realms where gods dwell--they will soon learn what is at stake. They will then begin a long quest that takes them from one plane to the next. Access to some of the more dangerous, higher-level planes will be unavailable until certain other conditions are met. So it'll be a long, tough battle--one that will require large groups of players to team up. One of the most popular aspects of EverQuest is the player raid, where dozens of players assemble and take on some of the game's tougher monsters. The Planes of Power is structured in a way to help encourage this. <br>

Everquest: Planes of Power <br>
<br>
This expansion is geared almost exclusively to levels 46 and higher. The only advantage for a player below level 46 is that you will be able to use the teleporters in the Plane of Knowledge that connect to all of the starting cities of the game. This is a nice feature, especially if you also have Luclin, but you will have to figure out if it is worth the price of the expansion. There may also be some lower level quests that start here. One interesting thing about POP is that there will be a version you can get that will include the entire game up to this point. Thus, if you don’t yet have Luclin or any other expansion, you may want to wait until this comes out so that you can get the whole set in one volume and save yourself some money. <br>
<br>
POP will introduce 18 new zones. All but 2 of them will be for level 46 and higher. Those two will be non-combat city zones. It will also introduce a new advancement feature. However, the exact nature of this is not clear. What seemed clear is that it will probably be something separate from the current level and skill advancement features. My guess is that whatever they add will be very time consuming and may even be open ended, since this is probably the last EQ expansion and they need to put something in that will keep people playing as long as possible. <br>
<br>
One of the stated purposes of Planes of Power is to allow players who are not in the uber guilds a chance to raid. They want players in POP to be able to form into random groups and still be able to survive. To do this, they created several new features. The first is that when you die in a zone, after 30 minutes or so your corpse gets teleported to a graveyard at the entrance to the zone where it is easier to recover and rez. This lets you die without worrying that you have to break the zone again just to recover your corpse. The second feature they created are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> specific raid rooms that are set up in duplicate and can limit the number of players who enter the room. Thus, a single high level encounter can be regulated so that only 6 or 12 characters can participate, and once they enter the room locks and nobody else can come in until they leave. The encounter would also be split so that three separate groups could be doing it at the same time. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There will be a story line introduced in Planes of Power that will progress as you go through the zones. The zones are to be traversed in a certain order and a player will need to meet certain requirements in order to go to the next zone. However, once you meet those requirements, you will be able to go straight to that zone from there on. It also introduces more detailed graphics and more items and quests. Expect several new particle weapons with this expansion. <br>
<br>
POP will ship before Christmas. If you are level 46 or higher, it is definitely something you will want to buy. After all, who can really argue with new graphics, zones and items? <br>

Honestly, with the content and philosophy of Planes of Power, we wanted to avoid a lot of risk. Redoing the graphics engine, a lot of the things we put in Shadows of Luclin, it had repercussions (depending on what part of the expansion you look at). It introduced a lot unknown variables. We're taking everything we've learned from past expansions, especially Shadows of Luclin, and just take the solid things that work and avoid some of the risk. We have so many things that we know work sitting in front of us. I don't see any sense in taking unnecessary risks.<br>
