I curse myself for not having put pen to paper before now, but, as is the case for me most of the time, the best intentions arent worth anything, without the drive behind them to make it happen. I suppose I should tell you a little about myself, before I begin. <br>
<br>
  My name is Seprentor. Nevermore, my surname, was given to me by a friend upon my 24th season as a ranger, due to circumstances that I need not go into at this time. I was born son to a not so successfull smith, and my mother was a barkeep. Mother passed away when I was young, and it was not until many years later that I realized that I had another family. My dad, apparantly, in his youth had fathered a bastard son and daughter to a dark elven whore named Osmosis. Blingington, and Blight were their names. They knew of me, and I suppose that I, too knew of them through stories, but never really paid that much attention, not knowing that I had the same blood in my veins as they.<br>
<br>
But I'm not here to tell you of family history. I'm relating a story to you.<br>
<br>
  Not long after the lands of Kunark were discovered, myself and a small group of individuals traveled the Timorus Deep to explore. Still relatively young, and impetuous at heart, there was little anyone could do to put a stop to it =)  <br>
<br>
  I need not go into the things we saw, as what was new and mysterious at that point is already old news, explored tried and true.  One night, while keeping guard while the others slept, I heard a faint noise to my east. I tracked it down, and came face to face with a dark elf. Strange to these lands as I was, at the time, we stared at each other, face to face, for what seemed like a full minute before either of us made a move. <br>
<br>
  He was a rogue, deft and agile, and although a tad bit younger than I, definitely had the skills to take me down. Instead, he wounded me and held me off with a dagger to my neck. I could feel the weak poison seeping in, and I dared not make a move for fear it would indeed be my last.<br>
<br>
  He spoke, and the words he spoke are etched in my heard forevermore.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I am your brother, Seprentor&quot;, he said, and went on to fill me in on the tale I mentioned earlier.<br>
<br>
 When we were lads, it appeared, on a mountainside in Rathe, I had saved his life. At that point in my life, a dark elf was just another life force, a child of Tunare. I had not yet learned the evils of the world. I had spooked him on that mountain, talking to the bears and listening to the trees. Something that apparantly, before that point in his life, he'd never seen. He lost his footing, and fell to what should have been his death. Grasping to a single twig nestled between two rocks, he was there screaming for his life when I first saw him.<br>
<br>
 Without a seconds hesitation, I rescued him. He thanked me, and went along his way. Later, as I told the tale to father, he childed me, and then told me of the dark elf and their ways.  <br>
<br>
Apparantly he and I werent' the only people on that mountainside that day, as his mother, who had been watching the young wood elf, trying to decide which way she would enjoy watching him die, also bared witness. I suppose my saving his life in turn saved mine that day. She also informed him later on, that I was his brother. And apparantly, he'd been searching for me since that day. <br>
<br>
<br>
As I lay there, dagger to my neck, he  spoke these words.  &quot;All the love in your kind sickens me to the core. I have tried, however unsucessfully,  to love things of nature, but all they do is stab you in the back in the end; so I must forever give up on this sojourn I've so stupidly embarked on.&quot;<br>
<br>
I remained silent, for it was the words of a madman that I was listening to now, no more a brother to me than the Dragoons that inhabit the Overthere.<br>
<br>
With that, he  threw his dagger to the ground, and muttered one single phrase: &quot;I think everyone would have been better off if on that day, so long ago, the twig would have been what broke, instead of my mothers' heart&quot;  And with that, he turned and flung himself from the cliff that could now be distinguished in the early morning light.  I crawled to the edge, to watch him disappear in the depths of the Timorus below.<br>
<br>
It was at this point that my party awoke, and I could hear them calling my name, as I wiped a tear from my eye.  <br>
&quot;I'm here&quot;, I called, and headed back to camp. This wasnt a tale I would share with them at this time. I've decided to share it with you now.<br>
<br>
Tunare be with you all...<br>
