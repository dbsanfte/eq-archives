I think using high tradeskills is a good way to find a decent middle ground.  After all, many claim that time/effort = reward.  Tradeskills are an excellent way for a solo/non-uber to gain high quality items using the above formula.<br>
<br>
Granted, the items are not equal to alot of higher end gear, but they are definately better equipment than a player could fight/solo for in most cases.  Like I said, it's a decent middle ground, IMO, and hopefully tradeskill items will continue to improve.<br>

<br>
Should non-raiding players have a prayer of seeing the best items in the game? No.  Not in Everquest.  That's the way the game has always been.  That is the basic tenet behind the game risk v reward.  Time put in v phat lewts coming out.  Raiding Uber_Mob_349 for the 100th time isn't the most exciting thing in the world.  But you do it in order to get better gear so you can take on the newest and baddest mobs in the game so you can get the newest and baddest gear.<br>
<br>
If I want something as nice a Burrower Hide Tunic...I damn well better be in a guild that can do the Burrower Cycle.  Raid guilds and raid players work hard for these items.  They work damned hard.  Until you've spent a weekend dying repeatedly with your character (or arguably worse, playing someone elses character because other characters &gt; Druids for raid necessity), bored out of your mind, frustrated to hell, sick and tired of dying, rememming spells, rebuffing, setting back up and trying the mob again..just to die again.  All so you can get a strategy down.  Until you've suffered through this...you don't deserve it.  <br>
<br>
My guild cannot kill the top mobs in Ssrae Temple yet.  We've not yet managed to kill the Burrower in the Deep.  We haven't even managed to kill the AoW yet (damn him...damn him to hell).  Do you see me on here complaining that I don't have access to a &lt;GM&gt;'s Ring of Anger, or a Burrower Hide Tunic?  No.  When I my guild can kill them...i'll have access to them.  <br>
If you want to be able to solo for the best items in a game, well go say hello to Diablo II.<br>
<br>
Take pride in what you are able to accomplish.  Do not be jealous of what others manage to accomplish, yet you haven't.  I camped for my Paw of Opalla as a younger druid.  It wasn't uber then.  I could have bought it for 4-6kpp.  I took pride in having mine, because I did the work to get it.  When my guildmates at the time would make remarks about how I have all sorts of nice gear..I took pride and joy in reminding them that I have it because I did the work for them.  The same principle rings true here.<br>
<br>
That being said, when the quest is far more difficult than the reward it gives...its broken.  <br>
<br>
Newsflash: Tradeskills, while annoying, are not that difficult (other than, perhaps, tailoring).  If you have the plat you can sit down in one weekend, with a little tenacity and some ibuprofen for your wrist, and get 160+ in 4-6 tradeskills. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

<br>
It gets them fired up because they want to have unique gear that very few other people have; they want something that sets them apart from the masses. Well, that in itself isn't wrong ... heck everyone wants to be different, and I'm sure you've seen plenty of people who are more than willing to wear a piece of armor with lesser stat mods than what they already have, just because the new tunic has a unique look, is rarely obtainable; i.e. status symbol.<br>
<br>
What he fears most, is that someone who doesn't HAVE access to high end content because they can't join an elite guild, will actually be able to quest for something a little better or fancier than what he gets when someone announces a loot drop as &quot;bah druid only, Aidon come get it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter that it only took 10 minutes for his guild to kill the mob which dropped it... doesn't matter that his individual contribution may have been small ... he thinks that such raid loot should always be better than what someone can get by travelling norrath/luclin for days and weeks, finding and collecting quest components. Do you see the inequality there?<br>
<br>
However, what Aidon and his uberkin don't like to think about is the fact that they got LUCKY by getting into a high end raiding guild before people realized how inconsequential the druid is to high end raids. Let them transfer their characters to another well-established server, sans name or external contacts, and see how easy it is for them to find entry into an uber guild. Most likely they'll find themselves rejected before they even get to the application page. &quot;Sorry we do not need druids, thanks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Even those power-gamer druids who DO have 50+ hours/week for playing EQ, aren't going be sought after by guilds capable of doing the types of raids Aidon disparages as &quot;easy&quot; encounters. <br>

<br>
C'mon, we all know the tradeskill implementation in EQ blows huge nasty chunks. None of us knows any sane person who gets a kick out of clicking COMBINE thousands of times, regardless of how pleased they may be with outcome. The whole repetitive clicking thing is BAD at its very core. <br>
<br>
What would you think of an imaging program (e.g. Paintshop, Fireworks, Corel) which lacked the ability to draw circles and lines, and instead expected its user to create a line by clicking hundreds of dots in a row? You certainly wouldn't be recommending it to friends, nor defending it on a public message board. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes the program will randomly have you fail to create a dot, and that will erase 6-8 of your previous dots, but if you keep clicking and making dots, you can eventually create a lovely line of the desired length!&quot;<br>

<br>
Are you even reading what you write?  This quest takes a helluva lot longer to complete than clearing NTOV.  By your logic, it should reward you with an item equal to that which drops there.<br>
<br>
I agree with Scirocco.  I like the quest; I'm working on it, but the final combines for each piece are currently too high.  If this was meant as a facilitator for &quot;player interdependence&quot; (to bring back a McQuaidism), then it seems to be failing, as most players posting about working the quest seem to be doing the majority of the combines on their own.<br>
<br>
With the amount of pp required to invest to complete the quest, and the fact that technically, outside of a few enchanted items you need an enchanter to do for you (and the imbue of whichever you don't worship, Karana or Tunare), you can do this quest entirely alone.  In a MMORPG, rewards will always be linked to the # of players which must successfully come together to effect any outcome.  Considering that, I think this reward is appropriate.  40 hp and 40 mana on a single earring is better than most earrings available to a druid who doesn't regularly raid the top-end targets.<br>
<br>
And as far as not being able to buy the spell - that's a moot point as VI has already stated it will be &quot;much more&quot; readily available after the next patch.  I see no reason to complain about this until we see what this form of availability takes.<br>

It makes me so sad to read the fervor with which many of you denigrate the druid class and Verant's treatment of it.

So where do you draw the line?  Should we thank them for snare, thank them for root, thank them for sow, thank them for ports, thank them for DoTs, etc. etc.?  What exactly does that accomplish?  That we're happy go-lucky with whatever is given to us no matter how flawed it may be?  I dont know about others, but i prefer giving an honest opinion, instead of faking how i feel.  I've complemented Verant in the past, i'm sure many others have as well.  Although at this point, they dont deserve much in the way of thanks from our class, if you feel that way, nobody is stopping you from doing it, just dont expect everybody else to have the same mentality as you.  <br>
<br>
Personally, i dont expect much out of other people here.  What i do expect is for people to accept other peoples opinions, positive or negative.  If you prefer to see only positive stuff, try the Druids Circle.  Just dont expect your values or what you prefer to see to override the honest opinions of others.  Thats being egocentric imo.  I dont presume to tell others to only post positively when they dont feel positive about Verant.  And to give thanks about stuff for the way it should have been in the first place, hmmm, well, i'll leave that up to you to thank them for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usorrun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorrun</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(5/17/02 4:49:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27319.topic&index=193>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> And here we go adventuring back into the "Swamp of Risk v Reward"... a little known zone between Feerot and Innothule...<br>

No desire to go point/counter point with Aidon... it just isnt proving to add any value to me or the board.  After seeing RTFM's summary (quite accurate I might add), I realized the ridiculousness of the discussion. <p><table border="0">

Raiding isn't for everyone. A lot of people just don't like to do it, but they do it because they want to upgrade their stuff over time. I really don't see anything that wrong with 250-skill tradesfolk being able to make a breastplate or a chestguard that is similar to a TOV HOT or west wing bp. Before you overreact, the tailor-made item, for example, has no clicky effect, and it doesn't have all superior stats. But it is about time that a 250 tailor can make something NICE. Maybe such a bp would sell for 20kpp -- I don't know on each server -- but it's an ALTERNATIVE to spending your life trying to raid. <br>
<br>
High-end content shouldn't be entirely about raids. That is my opinion. I really hope VI does consider that even if the player population is hovering at 60 or near 60 that raiding is not the only type of gameplay that makes EQ. :p <br>
<br>
Planes of Power: The first high-level raid-focused expansion. I am going to wait before making any judgment on this expansion, but I really think VI needs to improve some other areas of the game before encouraging everyone to be part of a raid machine. <br>

<br>
The thing is ... its not Aidon's effort alone we're talking about here. That's like saying &quot;all it takes for those 250 smithing people to do that PHAT bp is a few measly item camps&quot;. It's not the 10 minutes it takes to kill the mob.<br>
<br>
It's the effort put in by a large group of people to work their way up to level of mobs, getting the level of equipment needed, getting the level of co-ordination needed to kill the mobs where that stuff is dropping. This is effort over a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   long period of time</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, by a large number of people. Of course they got stuff along the way, but hey, so did the tradeskillers. ;-)<br>
<br>
I'm not saying I'm against these high level tradeskill items, but it really gets me when people equate the effort required to obtain an item as the effort required to kill that single mob. It just don't work like that :-p<br>
<br>
Edit: As an exercise, figure out the time it would take for a guild to power a tradeskill master and get components compared to outfitting the entire guild from equiv. mob drops. I know tradeskills have been on the bad side of that equation for a while outside of JC, but still. <br>

<br>
Actually I was comparing to high level raiding vs. high level questing -- not tradeskills. As I've pointed out on a few occasions, EQ's tradeskill implementation is way offbase and I wouldn't wish all that clicking on a crotchety mother-in-law.<br>
<br>
My quotes:<br>
&lt;&lt;What he fears most, is that someone who doesn't HAVE access to high end content because they can't join an elite guild, will actually be able to quest for something a little better &gt;&gt; <br>
and<br>
&lt;&lt;he thinks that such raid loot should always be better than what someone can get by travelling norrath/luclin for days and weeks, finding and collecting quest components&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Higher level questing could occasionally involve getting the help of one's guildmates and/or friends to collect some of a quest's components -- not necessarily to kill a particular boss mob, but to search for quest pieces in dangerous zones. However, I happen to believe that organizing huge raids to defeat uber boss mobs isn't a very appropriate definition for a game called EverQuest. <br>
<br>
One of the current problems facing players who wish to obtain higher-end equipement, is the competetion for unique boss mob camps. You'll find that especially troublesome on older servers where many stronger guilds have grown (none of whom are looking for druids...). Even if someone's guild can defeat a particular mob, they're trying to beat other guilds to the punch. <br>
<br>
Questing that would involve strategies, puzzle solving, and collecting items <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dropped by unique mobs, would be an extremely viable alternative. That VI has not implemented this more fully without dependence upon a flawed tradeskill system, looks to be due to a lack of imagination.<br>
<br>
Maybe they need to find some old-school D&amp;D dungeonmasters to write content for such quests. It is a shame with all the wonderful graphics, animations, and sounds of EQ, that a pen/paper game could still be so much more immersive in some ways.<br>

Given Verant's implementation of quests given the current limited system, I shudder to think how they'd manage to stuff up a more complex system.<br>
<br>
Anarchy Online has a much more viable &quot;quest&quot; system, at least at the stages I played it. The missions can be done in groups, and there are rewards along the way as well the final reward. The mission area is your teams alone, sometimes getting to the area is dangerous. I imagine if you used something along those lines as a base component you could get some interesting, long quests.<br>
<br>
I don't think, however, we are ever going to see decent quests in EQ. The entire system is just too limited. You can kill things, you can pick up ground spawns, and you can make items with tradeskills. Under the Verant Vision they will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all always</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> require some camping to limit the rate at which they enter the world. <br>
<br>
I sort of see what you're saying with the enter a dangerous zone and find something... But... It's either a fixed or random ground spawn (camp), or a fixed/random mob drop (camp). If there were zero competition yeah you could do it the &quot;proper&quot; way, but... *shrug*<br>
<br>
Another thought, if quests became the focus of the game, do you think the &quot;uber&quot; guilds wouldn't regear to do those quests? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's a different challenge, but still a challenge.<br>
