Well 500mt may be a bit too much considering they are 10400 x more powerful than what Pakistan is belived to have (48kt A-bombs).<br>
<br>
Really sad a country may have to be destroyed to save the world from terrorists with nukes and launching capabilities.<br>
<br>
It is another cold war but for SE Asia. And like Russia Pakistan may have groups hauling nukes around with no failsafe system(can be activated by the crews). Pretty dangerous sh|t.<br>
<br>
This is somthing we HAVE to be involved in. This is bigger than the Isreal/Arabs domestic dispute. All it takes is one nuke to hit New Dehli and bye bye hundreds of thousands of people. 2 mile radius destroyed, 3.5 mile radius of radiation poisoning.<br>

<br>
Isreal needs to wipe out those damn Terrorists in their country ASAP. Isreal is trying though.<br>
<br>
They need to wipe out terrorists and give the Arabs their own country and leave it the hell alone. Why? Arabs have children at nearly 3x the rate and they have some pissed off children that have to live with enemy tanks and troops in their cities. Isreal will have serious problems in the long run is somthing is not done.<br>
<br>
Arafat needs to be dealt with. Him and his Fatah group are just a bunch of terrorists who act like poloticians on TV and radio. His fatah group is attacking Tel Aviv area latly nearly on a daily basis. Probably a bit of revenge for imprisoning him in his compound and knowing that his days are numbered.<br>
<br>
Arafat has done nothing for peace, Isreal gave and gave and he would not accept anything. Now they got Sharone who will not work with Arafat. Arafat burned all his bridges. And the Arabs are paying for it.<br>

Or plant his hands down on the table and get it over with once and for all? As an American, I can say that I would not (and will not) tolerate attacks on our fellow contrymen on our home turf. I cannot expect Sharone or anyone else to think any differently.<br>

<br>
All the major powers WANT it to be a joke. The USA, Britain, France, etc ... they all want a UN that's a complete joke as far as being able to affect real change in the world. If the UN **HAD** power they wouldn't be able to run amok in the world doing whatever they feel like doing. If the UN had REAL power to do its job then the USA wouldn't be able to execute a war wherever, whenever its in the mood to and it wouldn't be able to tweak policies around the world in its favor.<br>
<br>
No, the UN isn't incompetent because of its design, its incompetent because nobody wants to give it the power to do its job. Its incompetent because all the major powers want it to be. Nobody in Britain, France, USA, Russia, etc wants an effective UN because then they'd have to live by the rulings of the UN themselves and the world isn't always going to be agreeing with them. Right now they live the high life ... a UN to write policy that they can ignore, or enforce at whim ... what else could they ask for? They write the rules and they enforce them when they're in the mood. Its a perfect situation for the major powers, it just sucks royally for everyone else because, as without the UN, you're stuck dealing with the whims of the major powers, the UN just lets you bitch a lot about it. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image src=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/Fdor.jpg></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthephoenixl0l.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Phoenix L0L</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 8:59:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16883.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/Legionoflight/LegionLoL.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Woo</span><hr size=1> Few questions for you:<br>

How many places do we go in to correct a bad situation if it has NO ecenomical gain for us?<br>

Lets face it Foreign human rights is simply a banner for war when needed.  It rallies the troops and stirs righteus rage which furthers support.<br>
<br>
Look at africa in 5 years there there is atleast one or two MASSIVE slaughters id imagine they put the WWII figures to shame.<br>

We need a UN like system and for it to work it has to be fair and we have to get our self rightous heads out of our asses, set standard rules for EVERYONE and then punishments that will make everyone follow them.<br>

The problem with your accusation that I am chastising past administrations attempt to keep the peace is that I do not believe that it was with peace as the driving force that these methods were used. I do not believe peace should mean forcing U.S. policy  on any country through subversive methods , which as can be seen, more often than not employs the use of extremist groups in its arsenal.  And you are right, world politics isn’t something that can be seen with perfect mental clarity, not even our government can do that.  But that does not exonerate it from accepting any blame and learning from past mistakes. It does not mean everyone should shut-up and go with the flow.    <br>
<br>
What I do chastise our government for is its continuation to employ such methods in light of the residual effects.  I also chastise our government for attempting to hide its association with these groups to save face when they come to bite them in the ass; as Mudoogul said, this is a situation of the kettle calling the pot black.  As long as we continue to hold this egocentric view concerning foreign policy, and continue to blame everyone but ourselves, these sort of things are going to continue to occur.  <br>

Dornin - I have not seen one in person, many through photo/video but not in person.  Do you know what killed them and by which force?<br>

Bobnob -  I don’t seem to remember all of Europe rolling over for Germany in WWII, I think that is what made it a war.  <p><table width="32%" border="1" align="center" bordercolor="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" background="http://www.guild-legerdemain.com/texture2.gif">

So true, cant say it better. I would love to pull out of Europe since they are all knowing, except for England, who still knows who to be friends with.

They did a good job with feeding the people. But more and more we were in Samolia the more we got involved with their warlords.<br>
<br>
Next thing you know the American Military is raiding buildings with innocent people in them with intel reports that it is a warlord building and then killing dozens of civilians!<br>
<br>
This happened once... The people of samolia having second thoughts<br>
This happens again.. Samalis getting mad<br>
<br>
Third time .. Somalis are getting pissed about cleaning up dead bodies from American raids..<br>
<br>
Forth time.. Troops decend from blackhawks onto a compound. The really pissed off people start up a riot and next thing you know you have a coptor on the ground and soldiers getting killed.<br>
<br>
Not the soldiers fault for what happened, But yes the fault of the leaders. You can not get too involved in the workings of another country. No matter how anarcist it appears to be. Especialy an Islamic country who are very dubious to Christian/Catholic countries. And hate Jewish states. Plus add propaganda to the equasion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucrapimvip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crap im VIP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 9:41:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16883.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Woo</span><hr size=1> That movie was fiction, a lot of the things shown where made up, if you actually believe hollywood makes documentaries you should go back to school.<br>

<br>
And wasn't the reason the US wouldn't pay back dues was because they weren't receiving funds the UN was supposed to pay for when our military was deployed on UN &quot;peace&quot; keeping missions?<br>
<br>
Don't get me started on some of the UN affliated programs like the world heritage sites.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons the US funded the muslim fighters in Afganistan was it's the case, &quot;My enemy's enemy is my ally.&quot; By backing them as they did they helped bring down the Soviet Union as we know it. The US won a war of attrition from afar. Unfortunately the billions spent haven't been payed back and it contributes to the 15% or so out of every tax dollar used to just pay the interest on the debt.<br>
<br>
I am pretty peaved in general about US policy in the middle east going all the way back to Truman. Even to the late 20's if you count the oil companies as being part of the problem.<br>
<br>
Then again I don't have much sympathy for the Muslims fighting Israel either. The UN brokered a deal for an independant Jewish state and they refused. The end result was Israel ended up with a bigger state than they were offered. Mostly land THEY had already bought up over the years. The exception of course is the west bank, et al. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uididartzan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ididar Tzan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/1/02 10:38:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16883.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Woo</span><hr size=1> When they made black hawk down they purposefully left out a lot of stuff and only focused on the efforts of the men once all hell broke loose.

<br>
Not as I understand it. Being voted off the panel isn't some horrible thing. Each &quot;region&quot; of the world gets a certain number of people on the board. Just so happens that other countries in the Americas got more votes than the USA did that year. Its not like they were voted off for some major deficiencies in human rights. <p><a href=http://home.thezone.net/~dhill/fdor.htm><image
