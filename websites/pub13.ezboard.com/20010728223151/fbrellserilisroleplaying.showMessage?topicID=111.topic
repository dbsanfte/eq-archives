The deep caverns were as easy to see in as burning noonlight to a pale skinned human, and the dampness kept her skin the velvety softness Mother always said was attractive. For a moment, she was almost happy as she lay against the rock column, the sounds of the dragoons and soldiers marching overhead as her finger tips trailed in the water. And then the dreamy contentment on her face exploded, her reverie snapped by a hard, sharp pain, the sort that comes from a quick kick to the side. In the seconds it took for her eyes to refocus on her attacker, he'd kicked again, landing a thudding blow as she tried to scramble to her feet on the uneven rock. It was only a few seconds more before her eyes could not see again, obscured by the water that she was so unceremoniously deposited in. As she surfaced the voice came to her, heard poorly at first through the water, then better as only the air carried the harsh tones of their tongue. <br>
<br>
&quot;Get out of there, ghoul food. Mother wants you. Now.&quot; And then the source of that voice was gone, hauling himself up past a soldier, coming to his feet next to a Dragoon, whom he divested of several coins on his way past. <br>
<br>
With a sigh then, the girl began to work her way to her home, to face whatever bizzarity the Priestess of Innoruuk whom she called 'Mother' had cooked up today. <br>
<br>
Surprisngly enough, when she reached the dank stone walls of her home, there was no surprise in particular, just a dinner of what appeared to have been a baker's traveling rations, and some fried dwarf. Through out the meal the older woman was silent, each of her three children keeping the silence about the table. Her journeys had gone well then. There wouldn't be too much pain, and perhaps even gifts as they returned.. <br>
<br>
After the meal, her mother retired to another room, to call each of the three of them in one by one, the eldest first. For the owner of the foot which caused such pain, there was a long time spent with in, while the two girls simply stood there, looking at each other nervously. When the boy emerged, he held in his hands a dagger of fine steel, it's blade hooked and jagged so as to cause as much pain as possible. Yet the joy on apparent on his youthful face was as tempered by something odd, something that the girl had never seen before.. could it be the taste of... failure? Still, she forced down her spurt of joy at his error as she heard her name called out to enter the room. <br>
<br>
With in that room was a simple sort of temple, an alter concencrated to her people's mighty god. Laying on that alter was a small pile of bone shards, for no apparent purpose. As she stood there, gaping at the bones, strewn for no apparent reason, her mother simply said.. &quot;You are to be tested, child of mine. Take up the scroll, and speak the words, perform the magic, or do not.&quot; <br>
<br>
The girl then lifted the scroll, unrolling the parchment of human skin, to pronounce the words written there in... A faint greenish glow began to gather about her hands, yet nothing happened. As the girl looked to the priestess, the older woman simply nodded, and said, &quot;You may go. Send Tenna in.&quot; <br>
<br>
As she left the room, and motioned to her younger sister, she tried her best to hide the fear and disappointment on her face, but to no avail. <br>
<br>
&quot;Looks the the Ghoul food really is gonna be a late night snack, huh? You're not quick enough for the Ebon Hand like me, and you've certainly not got a bit of the little one's strength. She'll be a fine warrior, but you're just Ghoul bait... In fact, lets just get it over with now, shall we, failure?&quot; All of a sudden, the point of the dirk was dancing and weaving, and as the girl tried to dodge, her velvety blue skin was torn open by the point of the dirk.. yet she did not feel the pain, only a sudden, intense hatred for this thing which had harassed and taunted her for all her life. Her hands lashed forth, as she grappled for the boys throat, intent on causing him as much pain agony as possible before he killed her... And then they lit with an intense, yet ruddy red light. <br>
<br>
The boy arched his back, and screamed once in mortal agony, dead by the power of Innoruuk even before his head bounced off the ground, with a dull thudding sound. After a moment, her mother entered the room from her chambers, Tenna fearfully hiding behind her... <br>
<br>
&quot;I wondered when this would happen... It certainly took you long enough. Child, drag this piece of dung out, and feed him to the ghouls. He is not worth wasting the blessings of the Father upon.&quot; As Tenna scrambled to obey, the woman scrawled some short phrases upon a piece of parchment, as she handed it to her elder daughter. &quot;Go unto the Lodge of the dead, and fear not the ghouls. Present it to the master knight, and he shall be responsible for you from now on.&quot; <br>
<br>
As the girl left, she did not bother to gather up her meager possessions, nor did she look back to her 'home.'<br>
<br>
Once the courage to pass the howling, rotting, ghouls was found, finding the master of the House of the Dead in his resplendant silver armor was a simple enough task. <br>
<br>
When presented with the note, the man simply snorted, and hurled a slightly ragged training tunic to the girl, before speaking to her in the cruelest voice she had ever heard. &quot;Go find Ulraz, maybe he can make you into a knight. Try not to embarrass our order too badly, Arathena.&quot; And then, the man simply disappeared down the hallway, leaving her to wander the halls of her new home, in search of this trainer... <br>
