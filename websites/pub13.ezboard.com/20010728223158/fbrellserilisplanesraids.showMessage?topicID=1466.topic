We have a couple of issues that could use some discussion.<br>
<br>
1. Cazic Thule.  He's a L57+ encounter in a zone made for mostly 46-54's.  It's questionable whether there's more than 2 groups on server that can even take him out.<br>
<br>
Question 1: Should CT still be considered a part of the regular Fear raid &amp; Scheduled?<br>
<br>
*Yes, only a scheduled fear raid should be allowed to kill him.<br>
*Yes, but another group can come in as long as they have the permission of the scheduled raiders.<br>
*No, the new CT is in a separate league from the traditional Fear raid, and should be treated separately.<br>
*Your own opinion.<br>
<br>
2. Hate.  There's a 2nd floor that is in some ways like PoG but also dropping things for rangers/pallies/druids.  Mobs are slightly higher level, pathing seems really lousy.  The time involved in clearing the main floor, then the second will likely be considerable.  Innoruuk seems to be similar to CT in some respects, although easier.  <br>
<br>
Q2: Should the second floor of hate remain tied to scheduled raids of the first floor? (This includes Innoruuk)<br>
<br>
*Yes, only people with a scheduled regular hate raid should be able to raid the 2nd floor.<br>
*Yes, but a second group may cooperatively work on the separate floors, provided they work things out with the group that scheduled the raid.<br>
*No, the second floor should be considerered a new zone, and treated as such.<br>
<br>
I need to know how people feel.  This isn't a voting thread, but if changes need to be made to the reservation rules because of the new gods/areas, I need to know what people want.  Feel free to deviate from the cookie cutter responses I've given already, or to even add your own commentary. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udexn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dexn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 376<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/20/01 8:56:09 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Hate/Fear changes Re: Scheduling</span><hr size=1> I've heard more about Fear than I have about Hate. So, for not, I'll only give my opinion on Fear.<br>
<br>
Since the gods are currently still on a weekly spawn rate, the fairest way to do it, would be to break out another reservation board just for them. Even if it's only two groups now, soon enough (several months) there will be more that can do them. <br>
<br>
Short of a separate reservation, just work it out with the existing raids.  Personally, this can get unfair, because soon enough more people will be able to do the gods, and doubtless we'll see rants about the various strongest guilds crossing paths somewhere. But, let's hope not.<br>

<br>
I don't think another scheduling system for the gods should be used just yet until it is obvious the level 60 guilds can't work together.  That just creates more layers of stuff to deal with.  They have to talk to the raid leaders anyway in order to set up times...so I don't see the problem in them asking the raid leaders if they can go after ct.  I'm only for this if obtaining permission is from ALL raid leaders until patch day or within one week whichever occurs first.<br>
<br>
2) *Yes, only people with a scheduled regular hate raid should be able to raid the 2nd floor. <br>
<br>
My main concerned about the number of linkdeaths and lag if we have two raids going on.  You would have to coordinate start times as well as portups etc who has priority?  If someone that can't handle the second floor wipes out, they may make it painful for the first floor raid in bugging them to help.  I just can see this as a mess.  If L/D and lag were fixed, I probably could go along with separate raids even though they would be more of a pain to set up. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaphdia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saphdia</A> at: 3/20/01 12:36:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukeyanaubaine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keyan Aubaine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/20/01 10:17:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Hate/Fear changes Re: Scheduling</span><hr size=1> let's look at the different options :<br>
1) set different shedules<br>
not appliable imo, agroing CT agroes the whole zone, killing golems triggers DTs, you need to clear a part of the 1st floor to get to the 2nd, lag would be TERRIBLE...<br>
<br>
2) Allowing a raid to zone in if they have the permission of another raid<br>
I strongly disagree with this, it would lead to a lot of abuses, with guilds having a plane reserved for a day, and being able to go in any other day.<br>
The rule is that ANY guild/indy can only lead ONE raid per plane for every 2 week period.<br>
<br>
3) not changing anything<br>
It's the best solution for now in my opinion, CT and Inny are tough, but far from impossible to kill for a high level raid with enough ressources. the old CT and inny were not really any easier way back when we killed them for the first time, and slowly they've been easier and easier, the same thing will happen for the boosted versions.<br>
If you plan on killing a god, lead a raid going for him.<br>
If you're planning on killing a god or going to the top floors of hate, either clear the zone yourself, or make a joint raid with another guild.<br>
<br>
Making a joint raid would not stop you from doing anything you want in the plane, whether you want to only kill the god, or only go up in hate, you have a deal with the other guild so it's only a problem between you and them. You can help them, or only zone in when it's cleared enough for you not to be on their way...<br>
AND it would ensure than noone can lead several raids to a certain plane in the 2 week period.<br>
<br>
Otherwise soon you will see a guild raid a plane one day, ask the permission to kill draco the naxt day, then zone in to clear CT the 3rd day, or spend the whole week up in hate.<br>
<br>
In other words, no need to change the rules for that, since everyone can raid the different planes as they want and still follow the rules current rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note, this discussion shows what SR and friends did was not clearly a good thing, or we wouldnt be talking about it (NOT a rant, just saying that this specific example shows not everyone on the server thinks zoning in in between raids is a good thing, my rant is in the rant forum, this is NOT one) <p><b>Keyan Aubaine</b> 51 Shadowknight<br>

*Yes, but another group can come in as long as they have the permission of the scheduled raiders.<br>
<br>
<br>
On both Hate and Fear.  All that needs to be done is the guild that's hosting the raid, if they know that CT/Inny is up, can account for this by having an &quot;extension&quot; in their signup list.  By this I mean that in their &quot;raid signup thread&quot; they can have a message saying that when they reach CT/Inny/Draco/2nd Floor Hate/etc they will bring up &quot;x&quot; number more ppl to deal with it.  They can even have in that same thread a seperate sign up for ppl who just want to do those parts.<br>

If a guild that can take Cazic down wants to do so after someone elses raid is over they should feel free to do so as long as no other guild that is capable of taking Cazic down has a raid scheduled before the next patch. <br>
Example: Guild A has Fear on Saturday but are not capable of taking Cazic down.  Guild B who is capable of taking Cazic down has Fear reserved on Tuesday.  Guild C also capable of taking Cazic down should not go into Fear after Guild A is done and kill Cazic because the next scheduled patch is on Wednesday and that would leave him down for Guild B who could have taken him down.  If all the scheduled raids though before the next patch were all by guilds incapable of taking cazic down Guild C should feel free to go in after someone elses raid is over and kill Cazic.  Not many guilds can take Cazic down maybe 2 to 4 on this server right now (?) so let them work it out amongst themselves but I think people are over-reacting about what happened as being FFA.  The game constantly changes so the old rules regarding Cazic and scheduled raids no longer apply.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Question 2--*Yes, only people with a scheduled regular hate raid should be able to raid the 2nd floor. Anything less would interfere with someone elses raid.<br>

At most they will stay up for maybe 2 weeks, nothing stops anyone from leqding a raid going for them, or to ally with someone to do so.<br>
<br>
I would compare the *yes they can come in to kill him if they have the permission of the raid to do so* with someone signing up for a VS raid, then inviting Watchers (or anyone else, it's just an example) as a whole, thus making them lead the raid for him.<br>
It does not delay the later raids or hurt anyone, but it would still smell very fishy to say the least.<br>
And killing CT would hurt the later raids, Uberguild_04 who signed up for fear to kill him just got ozned by Uberguild_03 who didnt bother doing it... Smallguild_02 suddenly has a raid with CT mean to pop on them in the middle of their raid..<br>
The current rules imply that CT may or not be killed by aby previous raider, it would turn into CT may or may not be killed by anyone at any time, &quot;&amp;@%ing up a guild who picked a day to get him, or who picked a day to make sure he would have been killed by Uberguild_04...<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, if you want to go without clearing everything, it IS possible already by accepting to do a joint raid and split the zone with the other raid. <p><b>Keyan Aubaine</b> 51 Shadowknight<br>

People should work together and see if there's a way that we can allow folks to smack down Inny and CT (or &lt;insert your boss MOB here&gt;) w/o stepping on the toes of a raid that's primarily interested in the &quot;traditional&quot; armor dropping MOBs.  <br>
<br>
I don't think there's a set line you can draw because of the varying capabilities of various guilds / raids.  For instance, last night KR did Hate.  We broke in at the portal (for chuckles and grins) and cleared the first floor in just a shade over 4 hours.  We then spent a couple of hours pulling stuff on the second floor just to try the new MOBs on for size (talk about crappy loot upstairs, BTW, unless you like junk AC 10 robes and FS.)  I know, based on past experience, that not every raid is going to have the time and / or resources to even clear to the second floor before the raid starts to peter out.  Some are, though.  If someone had approached us about wanting to take a crack at Inny, we probably would have done what we could to accomodate them without short-changing our own raid.  We had a great crew up with us last night, but there's no way we could have made a serious run at Inny.  Well, had we cleared to him we may have tried it on a lark to see how fast we could all get killed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Personally, I'd rather see the big guys go down and have someone benefit from them than have them go to waste.<br>

Cazic is going to break out the ol' KY jelly and go to town.  The name may be the same, but this guy is meaner than people are grasping.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, respect for the night's raid is very important as well.  I dont think a reservation board would work simply for the inability to predict the duration of a raid.  Some raids have been known to go on 8 hours or more...I dont think that many people are going to feel up for cazic at 5am.  In game talking is the key here.<br>

-This had better not lead to people hitting at CT or Inny while other mobs are up.  Blazing a path to the gods with reckless abandonment should not happen.  <br>

-Fighting repops to kill a god should not happen for fear of ruining another person's raid either.<br>
<br>
-Getting consent from the current raid should occur.<br>
<br>
-Getting consent from the next day's raid should occur as well, they may still want to give it a shot in hopes that they may kill the god, everyone deserves a fighting chance at the god, especially since they went through the whole reservation, two weeks in advace, board camping and all.<br>

<br>
I disagree with handing over a zone upon clearing it to another guild between raids.  That will eventually start more grief than it will solve.  Just watch for the rants, I smell them coming.<br>
<br>
And folks wonder why there is all this talk about this uberguild and that uberguild?  We are already talking about how we see a few guild capable of taking CT or Inny when in fact most of these guilds still gather assistance from other guilds.  Some folks can see this as talk of ownership if they want to.<br>

I don't think we should allow a raid to turn over the zone to another group for the express interest of boss killing.  The folks that have the raid should either call it or get reinforcements.  If they can't get the reinforcement, then pass CT or Inny to the next raid.  I think this attitude of worrying about a mob &quot;going to waste&quot; is really kind of funny.  It's going to happen with a reservation system in place.<br>
<br>
If you want the boss, schedule a raid.  If you worry about drops going to waste, lead the early portion for newbies and then bring in the big guns for the boss.  Just make sure you let the newbies know they will not get to help with the boss and not get a share of it's loot.  I think this is a better solution.<br>

IMHO, it's almost two separate raids that need to be coordinated.<br>

<br>
My stance on the questions are as follows.<br>
<br>
Q1) Yes, but another group can come in as long as they have the permission of the scheduled raiders<br>
<br>
Q2) Yes, but a second group may cooperatively work on the separate floors, provided they work things out with the group that scheduled the raid.<br>
<br>
As Jontann will confirm, clearing both floors in a single raid is nearly impossible.  Between Xinno's awesome pulling and the main group's superfast slaying we were not able to do it before people got tired.  We had no wipe outs at all...heck, even this squishy ranger didn't die even once, but it took about 5 hours to clear the bottom floor and 1 hour into the second floor (/rude fine steel drops) everyone was tuckered out and we had to call it.<br>
<br>
Mobs on the second floor were unimpressive..very easy I thought for 55+, but we didn't get down to Inny and his special friends.  I think this leaves a prime spot open for a high level guild to come in and clean up on the stuff they really want while giving the sub-55 people a shot at the old planar gear. <p><DIV ALIGN="center">

<br>
(Hate)<br>
*Yes, only people with a scheduled regular hate raid should be able to raid the 2nd floor.<br>
<br>
I believe that people who have been able to successfully reserve a slot for the plane should have the right to attempt the kill on the god. Splitting it up will lessen the experience of 'Doing' a plane. If the leader of the scheduled raid decided to bring extra people along to attempt a kill, that's there perogative. <p><center><a href="http://ang.mux.net"> <img src="http://ang.mux.net/newbg.jpg" border=0></a><br><img src="http://ang.mux.net/highbs.jpg" border=0> </center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Burn the Witch!</span><br>  Posts: 1497<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/20/01 12:46:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/ladun.jpg width=67 height=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Hate/Fear changes Re: Scheduling</span><hr size=1> Weighing in here. . .  <br>
Question 1: At the current point, no, CT shouldn't be scheduled, nor tied to existing Fear reservations.  What we have now is a completely different encounter.  It just happens to be in an already reserved zone, with the same name as a mob that existed before.<br>
<br>
Imagine this.  FG reservervations are only once per day, and are perma booked.  None of the guilds killing FG's are capable of killing Nagafen at the end.  There is a guild that is capable of killing Nagafen, but is only allowed to do him if they compete with the lower guilds &amp; reserve FG's too.<br>
<br>
Fear is a 46-low 50's zone.  CT is a L57+ encounter.  They are separate encounters, that just happen to be in the same zone.  This is very much like FG's &amp; Naggy are.  Do we have a rule that Naggy can only be killed by the group that has FG's reserved?  No.  They're separate encounters, of much different difficulty, and are on different spawn timers.  This is how Fear is now.<br>
<br>
On Brell, with new mobs, we don't setup a rotation list until a mob has been killed a few times.  There wasn't a trak rotation until he'd been downed several times.<br>
<br>
As long as a CT killing raid doesn't kill repops, or doesn't interfere with existing scheduled Fear raids, I have no problems with a group going in after another raid solely to kill CT.  The 2 or 3 guilds that could possibly muster a force required to kill CT have the ability to cooperate up until the point where a rotation of some sort can be set up.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it's harder in Hate.  We don't know how difficult it is to have separate raids running on the 2nd floor.  In Fear, regular raids can clear right up to CT.  A CT raid just has to go in, &amp; kill CT.  An Inny raid would probably have to clear most of the 2nd floor to get to Inny.  I'd like to see the 2nd floor treated as a completely separate area.  However, it might not be possible to do things on the 2nd floor without having them interefere with the first floor, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Saying that the people that are 57+ can't kill CT/Inny because they didn't reserve fear is illogical.  We don't force those killing Trak to crawl Sebilis for 3 hours first.  We don't force Nagafen raiders to reserve FG's to kill Naggy.  Those who want to kill the Dain aren't forced to clear all of Kael first.<br>
<br>
Even though the name is the same on Inny &amp; CT, they're very different mobs.<br>
<br>
Bottom line.   People that are not capable of killing CT &amp; Inny shouldn't be preventing those that are from doing it.   <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 616<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/20/01 1:03:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Hate/Fear changes Re: Scheduling</span><hr size=1> <br>
Hmm, I wonder how many of you have been to the second floor of Hate.  I'd estimate you need to kill less than 15 mobs in the new second floor area to be staring at Inny.  It's just not that tough to get there.  The mobs path so badly you can just run past them and camp to clear aggro.  They also don't see invis so you can do all sorts of CoH tricks.<br>
<br>
From port up to Inny killing me was about 3.5 hours if I remember correctly.  This may sound like a long time, but keep in mind we cleared &gt; 50% of the first floor, killed the hand of maestro and the uber hand, and putzed around figuring out how the second floor worked first.<br>
<br>
The in-zone teleport spells drop you right at the bottom of the ramp up to the second floor of hate.  A force capable of taking Inny could fight from there up without too much difficulty and without killing very many of the armor mobs.  Basically just the ones on the second floor where Inny used to be.<br>

<br>
Thanks for bending my thinking.  With Fear, I can see rading up to CT then calling it; and allowing another group to come in and take him down.  Can the Amy temple be pulled around CT?  It's my understanding no, so that may cause a little bit of trouble for a &quot;normal&quot; raid if they want items off them.<br>
<br>
Based on my experience in Hate, I can't see two full raids at the same time due to lag.  But I can see the same thing being done with Inny, allowing for no trouble with repops.<br>
<br>
I'd take a close look at the guilds who may be able to muster the troups to take the two mobs down though.  Reading a little information about them so far, I get the feeling that their difficulty lies somewhere between Gore and Trak.  But I'll let guild leaders hash it out.<br>

I haven't fought him myself, but hearing some of he play by play from the SR raid I'd say CT is much tougher than Gorenaire.  More HP, hits harder, and is just plain meaner.<br>
<br>
Inny is probably around the same general toughness as Gorenaire.  Need a different tactic to kill him and it will be a longer fight, but overall I'd think the same general strength.  Inny has a boatload more hitpoints but he's slowable and doesn't hit for too much.  I think it all comes down to fighting him in the right place so he doesn't jump around too much.<br>

You could with the old CT.  I don't think they'd change that for the new guy.<br>
<br>
Estimated HP's on Draco is 80k.  Estimated HP's on CT is 300k.  They both hit for 600's.<br>
<br>
Gore has 32k &amp; hits for 500's.  Diff is Gore can heal.  I missed the CT slaying (I'm only 56 anyways) so I can't really compare the difficulty first hand, but by my estimation, CT is harder in difficulty than Gore.  I think he's more along the lines of Dain, etc &amp; the other SoV ubermobs. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukallikamerov.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalli Kamerov</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 435<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/20/01 2:12:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/h/895/90/28959015.jpg width = 135 height = 184></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion: Hate/Fear changes Re: Scheduling</span><hr size=1> Well I was on the one &quot;regular&quot; (primarily 46-54) raid in fear with both Cazic and Draco up (Nocturnal Mist, the only other raid being Enshadowed's).<br>
<br>
Fright and Dread are just slightly easier than Cazic used to be, basically any raid that used to be able to clear fear could do these 2 no problem.<br>
<br>
Terror, for a primarily 46-54 raid requires everyone having cold resist gear to have a chance, it seems that under a 150 CR you're just gonna die fast, and his AE radius is rather large.<br>
<br>
Dracoliche is not killable for a 30 man 46-54 raid without calling in reinforcements.  It's just a long fight and Draco eventually kills the tanks.  At least his AE is pretty weak, and his fear is easy to resist.  But our 32 people couldn't get Draco below 60%, and I don't see a raid that doesn't call in reinforcements or 2 groups of 55+ getting him below 50% pretty much.<br>
  <br>
Only thing that's a bit tougher now seems to be pulling the Temple if Dracoliche is up, since the way I've seen the temple kited usually goes through part of Draco's pathing.  But even that should be doable.<br>
