Expanding a raid to 48 people WILL cause even more LDs.<br>
This is fact Roatus.<br>
<br>
Having 2 raids going on at the same time WILL cause command spamming of the zone AND since you CANNOT use say in the zone people WILL use ooc to talk to each other across groups which WILL cause even MORE spamming.<br>
This is fact Roatus.<br>
<br>
The sky raid rules were not invented out of nothing, but were establish due to experiences garnered over a long time, these rules are to ensure best chance of success for the going raid and to prevent the conflicts outlined above.<br>
This is fact Roatus.<br>

reduce lag and LD.<br>
<br>
I usualy ask people in one of my sky raid to put down all options (clip plane=0, serverfilter on, pcname off, dynamiclight=off, PC spells off, ...)<br>
<br>
Well about everything.<br>
<br>
Even with only 30 people in the zone I still see many LDs. I dont know what they did to the sky zone - but some zone may have 100+ people without that many trouble, and sometimes in sky you will have people going LD each time a fight start...<br>
<br>
<br>
So I fear that the idea of 2 simultaneous raids in sky isnt that bright. I guess that with 2 24 players raid, on seperate islands, you should be able to do it.<br>
<br>
But well as raid leader I still target 36+ people to be able to slaughter that cursed bzzt boss. And if at the same time another raid crew is engaged in an heavy lag fight - I really dont want to think about the amount of LDs generated.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for roatus precise-reservation system.<br>
I dont think it's a good idea either.<br>
<br>
What if your raid is moving at a good pace, and you want to take 1 more island that you usualy wanted?<br>
<br>
What if your raid crew has been wiped, and everyone is tired, or you had to take a mob more that planned at the beginning(dojorn?) and you want to stop 1 island earlier that you planned?<br>
<br>
Last skyre raid in sky we did :<br>
day 1 <br>
faeries, dojorn, azaraks, gorgon islands - camped on that one<br>
day 2 <br>
gorgon, pegasus, spiroc - camped on bzzt<br>
day 3<br>
bzzt, drakes, eye - jumped from there<br>
<br>
Now we initially planned to camp on pegasus at end of first day, should we have just cancelled the whole thing because something didnt go as fast as planned ...In my opinion it would have been -then- a waste of sky.<br>
<br>
I dont think that 2 raid crew can collaborate in sky - or maybe a real raid and a very small one (taking monk epic or clearing up to gorgon). Maybe I'm wrong and the raid I took part in where just laged for some unknown raison. But I dont think so.<br>
<br>
And I dont think either that you should have a island sheduling. Do you tell a trak raid to forget it and go home because they havent killed the protector in a given amount of time?<br>
<br>
see you soon<br>

&gt;tired, or you had to take a mob more that planned at the<br>
&gt;beginning(dojorn?) and you want to stop 1 island earlier<br>
&gt;that you planned?<br>
<br>
If there isn't other reservation, go your way.<br>
If there is another guild planning to go same isle,<br>
give up and try another day.<br>
<br>
What you wrote is:<br>
You raid Plane of Fear.<br>
Draco happened to spawn.<br>
You tried but got wiped out, ppl were tired with CR.<br>
You could kill Draco after.<br>
Next you wanted to take CT but you didn't have time on the day.<br>
You called night and came back next day to take CT.<br>
Other guild wanted to raid Fear,<br>
but your wipe out was not expected, Draco was not supposed to be up.<br>
So you raid fear 2nd day for CT.<br>
<br>
If you can't clear Zone in time you can't retry.<br>
Same. If you fail to raid sky you should give up.<br>
<br>
&gt;Last skyre raid in sky we did :<br>
&gt;day 1 <br>
&gt;faeries, dojorn, azaraks, gorgon islands - camped on that one<br>
&gt;day 2 <br>
&gt;gorgon, pegasus, spiroc - camped on bzzt<br>
&gt;day 3<br>
&gt;bzzt, drakes, eye - jumped from there<br>
This is correct use of 3days reservation.<br>
I don't see any problem. You did 1/3 of isles for 1/3 of raid schedule.<br>
Unless sky is &quot;seriously&quot; overpopulated,<br>
only 1isle delay won't cause trouble.<br>
If sky is overpopulated you should pass out to next raid crews. imo<br>
See the fact, weekend is being crowded.<br>
<br>
To Veranon:<br>
Idealy, cominucation will solve it.<br>
But ppl still need to &quot;plan&quot; before raid to gather ppl.<br>
If you allow ppl to make excuse for retry with &quot;unexpected trouble&quot;,<br>
this will prevent their recruiting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, let's see original topic.<br>
What i am pointing is, wrong use of 3days reservation.<br>
Look again<br>
<br>
1st day = isle #1<br>
2nd day = isle #1<br>
3rd day = isle #1<br>
<br>
Current reservation system allows this. This can HAPPEN.<br>
Wether intentional or not.<br>
Consider again what was 3days reservation for.<br>
Simply answer, is this correct? Is this good 3days reservation?<br>
Should this be allowed? [Y/N]<br>

<br>
Gimme a break. If you had some intention of going up and someone had it reserved, you talk to them like Friday, see what their plans are and if its reserved and they have a plan that conflicts with yours suck it up. <br>
<br>
You could cut reservations to 2 days, I'd fully support that, Sky doesn't have to take more than 2 days for a full trip to 8 for anyone really. <br>
<br>
But it's just silly to promote ever more complex rules when this is the first time I can remember in nearly a year there has been ANY kind of conflict over Sky. <br>

<br>
One large flaw in the scheme to make PoS supportive of 2+ raiding parties... Sirran. Only one Sirran can be up at any time and he is your way to keys. So if the people on isle 2 kill the Imp boss and the poeople on isle 7 just whacked thmeseleves a Sister...someone is fubared and bad. And you cannot 'work' this out all the time. There are key carrying mobs that you can only kill after the sister is dead. So you have to have someone hailing Sirran to keep him spawned for a good long while. You do the same thing on isle 3 and on isle 5 as well. /shrug. It just won't work.<br>
<br>
But that is not the only reason there should not be more then one party in PoS at any time.<br>
<br>
PoS is a huge pain in the butt! Island instruction, duel/summoning, dealing with keys, passing out loot... it  is all a pain... I cannot fathom having two raids try to fight for /ooc and /shout space. There are some zones where you can say soandso use ooc and we will use shout but PoS is chat intensive and this just won't work here. It would be a nightmare for everyone involved. <br>
<br>
The only solution I see is for the people wanting to go to PoS need to reserve a day NOT already taken by someone else. Then you don't have to worry about how far they went or how well they did. Get your own day, form your own raid, and go to it. My guild raids PoS more then anyone out there. We do 3 day raids because we like to farm some things. On a 3 day raid we do isle 1-4 on day 1 (fairies - horse/griffon...i do not count Dojorn as a numbered isle since you can skip it), on day 2 we redo 4 then farm 5 then clear 6 (bzzz), on day 3 we redo 6, clear 7, and kill the Eye if the Hand is not around. If we only want to go for epic stuff we grab a weeknight and just do epics. Last Wednesday we took 40 people up and farmed 5 till 3 wingblades dropped, cleared the bees, and cleared 7 hoping for mage crowns to drop(4 non-abyss mages needed crowns). None did... So I reserved PoS for tomorrow night and we're only going to 7.<br>
<br>
Is PoS wasted? Should someone else come up and clear 1-3?<br>
<br>

Nor did we intend our 3 day reservation to be a &quot;test run&quot; or a &quot;practice&quot;.  Honestly, how many folks can say they've never had something planned so well, or researched so much that they didn't have a slight case of overconfidence?  That overconfidence in part was what led to some of our dilemas, and is a mistake we don't intend to make again.<br>
<br>
I agree that 3 day reservations should not be made to reserve isle 1 and only isle 1.  I agree that folks who bite off more than they can chew should know when to say, &quot;enough, let someone else have Sky.&quot;  I agree that folks should be curtious to their servermates, and try to get along as best they can, communicate constructively before accusitorily, and come to reasonable compromises when they're is a conflict.  And I do mean reasonable, not &quot;get out of the plane, you're taking too long on your reserved days.&quot;<br>
<br>
Multiple raids in Sky seem impractical to me, unless two smaller guilds/raids that want to go up are in total agreement on all details.  It can't be effectively scheduled using only the calendar, and as Thoric mentioned, adds too many rules and potential for arguments and confusion.<br>

I wouldn't be objected to a 2 day reservation change personally.  Seeing what we were able to accomplish considering the limited number of resources we had at the time to rely on, I see no reason why a well balanced raid can't do 1 - 8 in 2 days. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uleare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leare</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/1/01 12:08:31 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=Http://member.aol.com/bushtfur/dagger Height=180 Width=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Sky rule need to be changed with strong guide line</span><hr size=1> If you don't care for the opinion of a 25th Rogue don't read.<br>

If you reserved PoS for 3 days.  You can stay on island 1 all 3 days for all I care, and I still wouldn't consider it a waste.  Telling people they would have to make it to island 4 in a day, although not to hard, is just stupid.  Every other raid in PoS has followed the same rule, isle 1 - day 1, isle 1-4 - day 2, and isle 4-8 - day 3.  It's the way it's always been done and shouldn't be changed.<br>
<br>
It would be the same as tell someone who reserved the fg's if the can't get to the king don't reserve them.  And although we all know most people will kill King Tormax (Or however it's spell, you know who I'm talking about), but if they didn't should we call there raid a waste, I think not.  Or telling someone raiding Fear if they don't kill Cazic, then it's a waste.<br>
<br>
To tell anyone who rightfully reserved a zone that their raid was a waste or to say the zone went to waste for whatever reason is just ignorant. <p><img src=Http://member.aol.com/Bushtfur/Leare><br><br><i>"Anyone stupid enough to get close enough to inspect a Rogue deserves to walk away a little lighter<br><br>-Leare"</i></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1638.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1645.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1647.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1638.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1638.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1638.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisroleplaying">Tome: History of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For Group<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
