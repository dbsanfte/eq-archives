It made me happy.  EverQuest had become a burden then, and the stories added color for me in a way that advanced textures and horses could never do.  Hopefully it will work again, otherwise I am going to run Arkonn screaming into the Hole and leave his soulless, stinking corpse there to rot.  I am terribly lonely now, playing EQ - I am without guild, and my old friends are either too powerful for me, or gone.<br><br>  With this in mind, I dedicate this tale to three people - to Chants, to Kestri, and to Taerma, my lost bride.  This song concerns the last of these.  If you remember me at all, thank you for taking time to read this story.  If this is your first Humwawa short story, there are better - thank you, at any rate.  &lt;Comment after reading this - &quot;Ack!  I'm a Hedonist Writer!  Wilde would be proud!!&quot;&gt;<br><br>                              Taking the Bride.<br><br>  Taerma had been waiting for him in the moors since dusk had fallen, her form muted by the soiled moonlight which dribbled through the spanish moss to frame her body in tarnished silver and sodden grey.  Once this physical form had radiated with the magnificence of the Immortals, granted a stolid beauty and steadfast calm by the Tranquil One.  Ebon skin shone faintly with the luminance of exhaustion and terror, but ravenously enough that even the soft, strong steelsilks which bound her failing body seemed eaten through by some strange, iron-mawed moth.  Even still, she waited, her back pressed against one of the gnarled monstrosities which could have once been called trees, before the Walker had touched them.  This grove was sacred to Her, the Mother Who Eats Her Young, the Lady of the Wilted Grove.  It was here that the young paladin was to meet her husband.  She had recieved his beckoning in a dream a fortnight ago.  A woman had come to her, her blinding white skin cloaked in silks that collected around her in the vague form of a newly-opened rose the color of lamb's blood.  The Lady told of his summons while Taerma lay peacefully upon her hard, modest bed within the Temple of Quellious, and she had obeyed his messenger.<br><br>  The stagnant wind staggered up from the shallows of the fetid water and rose up with the strength of the unliving, writhed around Taerma's buckled form, and she weakly raised her head to catch the scent of an autumn wind, lightly brushed with the sharpness of perfume which is worn by fallen leaves and can never be replicated by mortal man.  She smiled faintly, only half of her mouth upturning slightly and the other half left broken by the spiritual anguish imposed upon her by this land.  Yet to her groom these marshes were sacred grounds infused by the undying, yet never-living might of a cannibal goddess - he was a priest to Her.  She sometimes came here, against the quiet warnings whispered to her by the masters of her faith, so that she might commune with Her, the One which had set fire in her lover's right hand and woven wreathes of nightshade and hemlock through his white hair.  She wanted terribly to know his thoughts, to feel the ecstasies she had known him to feel when under Her Divine will.  There had been nights like these - frozen nights filled with the cloying odour of decay and the soft sighs left in the wake of the Walker's perpetual reaping - where she had sworn to give anything she had to offer, to whichever deity would strike pact with her, in exchange for an understanding of Humwawa's devotion to such a being as She.<br><br>  Was he not wise enough to see Her intentions for him? - she had wondered early on during her meditations in Erud.  And Quellious would answer her gently, with the lucid depth of an unfathomed summer sky, &quot;Yes, my dear one.  But do you know his intentions for Her?&quot;  She could not invoke further illumination from Him then, and now the Tranquil One did not speak to her.<br><br>It is only a momentary lapse. - she thought then, as the wind slithered tightly around her veiled form.  I will know my man's goddess, and I will know him through Her...but communion with such a force is difficult.  She must be coaxed from the rotting weeds and rankly steaming pools of Her claimed land.  When I have seen Her face, when I have known Her, the gates of the Calm will be opened me once again.  Not until then.<br><br>Taerma was alone for the mulititude of her reflections here in the fens, but this night he was to be at her side - at her side again!  She could feel the tides with which the Tidelord had made her bones surge and crest with the prospect of his furious heat and midnight skin, devoid of stars, pressed against her deep, fertile earthen flesh.  They would comprise the entire world here, in the Walker of the Violet Twilight's decayed garden.  They would bring together the living earth and blackened sky.  She longed for him.<br><br>  A hissing, creeping laughter crawled to her ears along with a soft snapping sound - a twig, perhaps.  The sound wrenched her from her gentle musings.  With a hollow, wasted left hand, she drew her sword.<br><br>                 -----------------------------<br><br>  The Destain walked the marsh once more, his blighted boots burning the sodden peat to dry and brittle dust with each step.  He breathed deeply the dense air into his lungs, and shook with the magnificence of his goddess' presence there in the damp, dark winds, the shimmering corpselight which danced a rabid waltz between the branches of the ebontrees.  He knew the Walker was pleased with him this night, although She had kept the reasons for Her joy to Herself.  He had fulfilled the task set before him by her undeniable mandate.  At Humwawa's right, Jibantik walked silently, his form seemingly deeper, almost swarming with the strength granted him by both the Walker's favour, and by Her almost maddening proximity to the mortal world there in the Decayed Garden.  In the skeletal servant's arms lay the unconscious form of a young Erudish girl, a prize for the Mother's table.<br><br>  Strange, - Humwawa thought.  This one is not marked for the passage through the Veil yet. The Walker has claimed this one too soon, perhaps.<br><br>  He breathed in again as the winds rose joyfully to meet him.  The faint taste of autumn leaves struck him, which must have traveled far from the wildlands of Kithicor to greet him there.  But there was another unexpected scent, a familiar one, lingering sickly amoungst the others.<br><br>  Why would she have come there upon this particular night, of all others?  Why this one night, when the Walker decreed the death of an innocent girl for Her greater glory, a child of Erudin, no less?<br><br>  Taerma, - he whispered.  Hold, Jibantik.<br><br>  Jibantik obeyed, cradling the sleeping girl in his skinless, discorporal arms, almost as if the young one had been born of it's barren loins.<br><br>  We turn around now, Old Bones.  Now is not the time for my hand to lead this child to the Walker.  She is not marked for death just yet. - Humwawa's voice held the weight of command, the easy control of a master.  When he caught the vicious vermillion sparks which marked Jibantik's eyes, however, he knew that his servant would not listen.<br><br>  Jibantik, obey me. - the Destain hissed. <br><br>  Humwawa heard the quiet rasp which marked Jibantik's inhuman laughter, and the faint gasp and brittle cracking which accompanied it the sound of Jibantik's death-cold hands effortlessly snapping the girl's neck.<br><br>  Whirling, the Destain's right hand blossomed with the fury of a flashfire as he struck the Old Bones.  Jibantik did not resist him, and as the bloodfires ravaged the shade it smiled lightly, almost happily, if a shadow may ever feel such light emotions.  The air buckled slightly around him as Humwawa's servant returned quietly to the Deadlands.<br><br>  I do Her will, my Master. - the Old Bones' whispered reply echoed in the slence of it's passing.<br><br>  Kneeling, Humwawa reached down to the crumpled form of the dead child, his hand a full, bloodied bloom which he held suspended over the body.  His mouth breathed visceral words over the child which spun out into the silence like the webs of a spider comprised of sinew.  He lowered his hand to brush it against her high forehead when he heard a tangled scream behind him.<br><br>  He rose quickly, and turned to meet the sound.<br> <br>               -----------------------------------<br><br>  Taerma's eyes filled with disbelieving tears as she saw her husband crouched over the broken body of a young erudian.  Her throat would not obey her, and the cry which soared out from her and over the decrepit moor shook free the last threads which held her sane mind to the tarnished moorings of her stagnating faith.  Her mind fled from her.<br><br>  I have married a demon, I have been hand-tied to a murderer.  I shall never be clean again. - she whispered.<br><br>  Humwawa's raven form split earth from sky, still and black before her.  The ground quivered with the light from his killing hand, his red right hand.<br><br>  A voice rushed over her, silent yet roaring with power, soft yet barbed with the broken bones of countless sacrifices.<br><br>  &quot;You had asked for knowledge of me.  And I have given it, you who sought to bind your spirit to my chosen one.  See now, daughter of Quellious, the being you have married...and in your handfasting, you have tied your hands to me as well...and now, sweet sister-daughter, you come to me.  I shall be your wife as well.  Your sword.  Use it.&quot;<br><br>  Humwawa trembled as Taerma slid her sword-blade between the steel-silken folds of her dress armour, and the ground groaned happily as it drank her heartblood.  He rushed to her.<br><br>  He spoke the same words which he had called forth over the erudish girl, wove the ruby light of his hand over her warm body of his fallen bride, painted Taerma's soft forehead with blood-light.<br><br>  Mortal world, Deadlands, converge within your body.  Your time has not yet come - the Walker has no need of ye.  I bind ye to flesh again, I tie ye with muscle and artery, fasten ye down with a lock of clean, white bone.  This chest may only open for breath.  Rise. - His words wracked the ground with pain, it seemed.  Before Taerma's fallen form the ground rent and tore, gaping and wide.<br><br>A shroud rose before him, a form swathed in dirt woven into spanish moss, embroidered with cryptworms and beetlekin.  He looked full into the face of the Walker of the Violet Twilight.  He saw Death.<br><br>  YOU MAY NOT BRING FORTH THOSE WHOM I HAVE CALLED TO MY BOSOM, DESTAIN. - Her voice caused his eardrums to rupture, blood ran freely from his nose.<br><br>  Please!  Your voice, mistress!  I am dying! - Humwawa screamed from split lips, through a fractured throat.<br><br>  Her right hand lifted from the shroud.  A beetle fell chittering from Her index finger and fell spinning into the blackness below Her.  The Walker passed Her hand over him.  The flesh knitted together, the rent tissues were stitched and repaired.<br><br>  I have not healed a living thing since the Creation.  Know that you, blasphemer, still bear my highest favour. - the soft voice issued from the hulking, moss-robed thing was vaguely feminine, massively commanding.  The Destain bowed his head to hide his eyes.  <br><br>  Taerma D'Estain has been called home to me.  She rests by my right Hand, blessed with the knowledge she so desperately desired.  She wished to know ye, Destain.  She will know you now, more intimately than her crude, corporal methods would ever allow.  And she is my Bride as well as yours.  You are a bredth away from that purpose for which I saved your mortal life four decades ago.  This paladin was and shall still be a crucial part of my designs for ye.  If ye have faith in me, ye will obey and believe my words. - the Walker's words seared his eyes with agony, such was the weight of the Divine's words. Your work is through this night.  Return to your dwelling place, and think of her - the Lady of Peace who has died for ye.<br><br>  The queer sucking sound which marked the Walker's return to the ground was the total inversion of birthing.   Marshground sighed brokenly as it submitted to Her demands to return into its wet folds, and as the Mother Who Eats Her Young receded into the slime the Destain, Humwawa Dosoloth wept silently.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>....damn that's dark.
