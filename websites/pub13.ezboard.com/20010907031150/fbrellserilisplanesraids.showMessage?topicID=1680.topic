Mostly but not all from non-US players. well time to start one as a US player. I persoanlly have raided Fear more times than i care to admit to. I have led the recent vast majority or pulled it even. (Yes paladins can pull. if they die no one misses them). Anyhow, a little history. I started Raiding Fear WAY back when Adun would lead back to back to back raids in fear. Thorondar was still Fletop... get the picture? -) As the reservations became more and more packed we made damn sure we were out and done by a minimum of 5am est. when i raid now, i make sure we're out at a reasonable time. even if the zone isnt clear. <br>
<br>
So i claimed the 22nd of this month. Zenith has the 21st started for a 11:59PST start... a little late and bordering on trying to claim the 22nd but fine i thought.. more than enough time to repop. i get a message on my sign ups that they wont be starting at there posted time. they would be starting at 5am pst. <br>
<br>
Evoluxa had fear last week when Jillie cancled due to no longer being an Indy. they claimed the date she left opens 2 nights before. Europa Tribes... missed something... and went in to clear out CT anyhow. We were in the zone when it started repopping. it was 13 hours 3 minutes to first pop. then it was a sporadic pop all over the zone. things were repopping before our eyes near the portal almost 2 hours later. Makes it a very dangerous situation. so lets say it takes 15 hours to get the zone popped enough to safely pull it. if Zenith started at 5am pst that would be 8pm pst before we could reasonably start... 11pm est. 4 hours after our posted time. <br>
<br>
So i talked to Roatus. he said he &quot;can&quot; start the raid at 11:59 and then have &quot;delays&quot; till he wanted to start. all his griping about whats fair and whats not on FG raids and compromise... he wouldnt be swayed to saying he would be starting when he felt like it. A little pissed i replied &quot;since i have the date of the 22nd reserved i &quot;CAN&quot; go in at midnight on the 22nd and start clearing the zone. then i can reclear it later&quot;. So in essence wouldnt he have been trying to claim the 22nd and is trying to muscle in?<br>
<br>
i am at a loss here. he posted an iffy start time to begin with. now hes messing with repops on a legal reservation. i swear my guild is cursed when it comes to Fear. each and every raid we've had one thing or another screw us over for a start time. dont just ask my guild members, ask any regualr fear goer with us. but i digress.<br>
<br>
So what is the right thing to do here? He is starting way later than he posted and well into a date legally reserved. i took a friday so we would have some extra time to clear the temple and such and to deal with having CT and Draco and golems up if they are. <br>
<br>
I am not spiteful enough to go through with my threat. but you add to it that the plane REALLY wont be used on the 21st... i specifically chose the 22nd so MOST of my guild could attend. looking for some clarification here.<br>

The previous days raider needs to make an effort to be done at a reasonable time so that the next crew does not get nailed.  It is common courtesy, plain and simple.<br>

Adune, you are very supportive of the Europeans finding a solution.  But for you to say that others are telling them to F*** off if they don't like it is wrong.  <br>
<br>
Just because some people like how it works now doesn't mean that they say to hell with the people it doesn't work for.<br>
<br>
Also, I agree that a change is neccessary, just that telling other raids screw you is a good way yto faclilitate it.  <br>
<br>
People have good intentions in trying to make changes.  But pissing off others and acting rash is not a good way to go about it. <p><center>

<br>
Hrm, you still don't see what I'm trying to get you to see.  Yes, the 21st is the 21st &amp; the 22nd is the 22nd FOR YOU.  That's because our calendar is based around PST time.<br>
<br>
Roatus isn't in PST time.  For him, the 22nd is the 21st, and the 23rd is the 22nd.<br>
<br>
See this from their perspective.  You're saying that they must adjust everything to work by YOUR timezone, YOUR dateline.  It turns out though, that it's impossible for them to do that, because of repop issues.  Your response is &quot;The 21st is still the 21st&quot;.  That comes off as being quite arrogant. (My time zone is the only one that matters, I don't need to understand your issues.)  This may not be your intent, but that's how it comes off.<br>
<br>
When you say the 21st is still the 21st, you're basically saying F-Off.  If he reserves the 21st under your system, he gets an empty plane.  He tries to reserve HIS 21st, and you say, No, you can't do that.  How is that not telling his to piss off?<br>
<br>
*beats everyone in the head with a hammer*<br>
<br>
Get it yet everyone?<br>
<br>
**Edit**-I need to include an example.<br>
<br>
Alright, let's say for a second, the calendar isn't based in PST, but in another time zone.<br>
<br>
The date change happens at 4 PM our time.  So. . .  We sign up for Tuesday on a week.  All other raids that week are in the other time zone, &amp; happen from 6 PM-1 AM their time.<br>
<br>
So their Monday raid happens.  It's now Tuesday their time, and the day of our raid.  It's still Monday for us.  We go up at 7 PM our time.  Wait!  The plane is empty!  I guess their MONDAY raid just cleared the plane oh, starting 9 or 10 hours ago.  We can either scrap our raid, or wait 4 hours for repops.<br>
<br>
So we've got a problem.  If we sign up for a date, unless we go in at Noon or earlier, there is NO WAY we can get a planar date, unless the previous day has NO raid.<br>
<br>
That's because when we reserve a date for TUESDAY on their calendar, it's really MONDAY for us, and we simply going in a few hours after they're finishing their MONDAY raid.  If we sign up for TUESDAY, and actually go in to a full plane on OUR TUESDAY, then we screw up THEIR WEDNESDAY.<br>
<br>
So. . .  Saying the 21st is the 21st is saying that &quot;Only my time zone matters, and well, you're just screwed because you can't raid at 11 AM every day.&quot;  I fail to see how being arrogant and saying only my time zone matters, and that everyone must conform to our time schedule, even if it's impossible is any worse than saying, &quot;We're going to run our raid on OUR time, and if that inconveniences the next day's raid, too bad.&quot;<br>
<br>
I actually find that response better.  They're simply claiming the right that everyone in regular PST time takes for granted.  To run a raid in the evening, their time with a fully popped zone. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uadunofbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adun of Brell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0> at: 6/13/01 9:08:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uletholas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Letholas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/13/01 8:57:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The &quot;Clarification&quot; trend</span><hr size=1> Um, Adune<br>

That is not what I am saying however.  Follow me obtuse one.  This boards is on PST.  The calander is on PST.  PST is the time line used to schedule things.  Why?  Becase if we use differnt time zones know one will know when things are starting.  <br>
<br>
Obviously Roatus is in a different times zone with a different time perspective, that is what the problem is about.  It does not preclude us from using PST as a frame of reference however, as without one who the hell knows when or what we are talking about.  IF you prefer, use GMT, the problem remains the same.  Your solution in the other thread also seems somewhat valid, better than mine.  But do not get your unides in a bunch about the use of PST, that is the established frame, and solutions are as easilt built around them as EST, GMT or Danish Time, Japanese Time, or whatever.<br>
<br>
And to reiterate, when I wish to cuss someone out monk, I will do it.  When I do not, it is deliberate.<br>

Saying the 21st is the 21st is saying that &quot;Only my time zone matters, and well, you're just screwed because you can't raid at 11 AM every day.&quot; I fail to see how being arrogant and saying only my time zone matters, and that everyone must conform to our time schedule, even if it's impossible is any worse than saying, &quot;We're going to run our raid on OUR time, and if that inconveniences the next day's raid, too bad.&quot;<br>
<br>
I actually find that response better. They're simply claiming the right that everyone in regular EST-PST time takes for granted. To run a raid in the evening, their time with a fully popped zone.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ueoralsolis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EoralSolis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 235<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/13/01 9:24:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The &quot;Clarification&quot; trend</span><hr size=1> Which is why Adune, if both the 21st raiders and the 22nd raiders tweak their schedules by an hour or so each both can be accomodated, though neither 100% the way the want.<br>

<br>
Is it arogant to say hey, so and so is raiding on the date I signed up for, what the heck is up with that?  <br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Is there a compromise available?<br>
<br>
Yes, but only if both sides agree to give a little.<br>
<br>
Is Crankie a stand up guy who not only would avoid interferring with another person's raid in a hearbeat, but goes out of his way to help other people figure out solutions?  <br>
<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
I agree that the European and Asian Players are getting the short end of te stick here, though off hour US raiders are getting the same thing.  But people in the plains, especially raid leaders, need to know when the next raid is startting and plan accordingly.  If you cant get done in time to prevent an inconvenince due to raid catastrophe, for example, total wipe out and an extra 2 hour CR, or late start due to cleric/chanter no shows, then a raid leader should stop early with mobs still up, not because he or she cant take em down, but because it will severly hinder the next start.  That is common courtesy in any time zone.<br>
<br>
It does not mean an off time radier should not be allowed to raid, but the solution remains the same, raid leaders figure it out and both try and give something so both crews get a fair shot.  As long as both raid leaders do this honestly, and do not take an  extra 3-4 hours, starting with a portal break and clearing the SS mobs last, then it can work.  But it takes effort.<br>
<br>
<br>
When it doesn't is when people get hot, and you can't blame em for that, even though only calmer heads will find solutions.<br>

What I am trying to say, and badly it seems, is that to make a change you make accomodations for people.  Find a compromise.  Use communication skills to make it work.  Stop saying screw those that have screwed us before and not try to fix it.<br>
<br>
If you want a change it takes time and a lot of people working together.  And I don't see that happening here.  I see &quot;Well we have been screwed over before, and now it is your turn.  See how we feel?&quot;  And to me that is a negative way to accomplish something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaalouf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maalouf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/13/01 9:37:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://129.82.121.243/morkjl/Bmal9g.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The &quot;Clarification&quot; trend</span><hr size=1> Zenith reserved fear at 21th 23:59 PST.<br>
But truely we are going to start raid around 22th 4~5 am PST.<br>
<br>
This was what was posted to SoT... basically saying that no matter what time zone you look at they are not planning to enter the plane untill friday the 22nd, they will not be in there at any hour in existance on a thursday, unless they stick to their intended start time, and even then it's only got a 4hr (based on the fact that pst is -8hrs from GMT, and there is a 4hr time zone buffer to IDL from pst) limit on even being remotely called thursday the 21st.  So basically their raid will be taking appx.. 11hrs from 11pm the 21st which puts em at 10pm pst allowing 5hrs for the zone to repop on SoT, which means our zone will not be spawned.<br>
<br>
I've even heared adune and several other state that if you can't get to the portal in about 5hrs of when your raid starts you shouldn't be doing the plane, this is what is going on.  And the raid no matter what time zone you look at will be on friday the 22nd not thursday the 21st, because of the time they plan on entering the zone. <p><IMG SRC="http://129.82.121.243/morkjl/eq/cazicmaal.jpg"><br>

He got Fear for 2 days now.  21st and the 22nd.  It's not a matter of Time zone issues or any other BS he's claiming.<br>

If Roatus were to reserve the 22nd, for 5 AM, then someone would have reserved the 21st with a let's say 8 PM PST start time, &amp; Roatus would zone up to an empty plane.<br>
<br>
So it's okay for Roatus to zone into an empty plane, but it's not okay when you have to do that?<br>
<br>
He doesn't have fear for 2 days.  He's got Fear for the evening on one day, in his time zone.<br>
<br>
All Roatus wants is the same thing everyone else gets.  A raid on Fear, in the evening his time, where the plane is popped.<br>
<br>
Off hours players NEED to have the right to raid just like the rest of us, or I can no longer support our reservation system.  I WILL NOT be the moderator, or support a system where the majority can bully around a minority, and say they can only raid an empty plane.<br>
<br>
I don't see how you can see this as anything but a majority denying a minority access to something. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udanforthsot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DanforthSoT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/13/01 10:08:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The &quot;Clarification&quot; trend</span><hr size=1> I see your point Adun, BUT he broke the rules as they now stand. <p>Danforth Cryptlurker<br>

Were this situation reversed, I could not in good conscience claim the 21st when, according to the calandar in use, it's really the 22nd.  That's just asking for more confusion...Then someone else takes the 22nd, and someone gets stepped on.  I don't <br>
<br>
However, I've always considered the word compromise to mean that everyone gets a little something of what they want, but no one really gets it all.  I've been following these threads pretty closely, and I see only a few things that even REMOTELY resemble &quot;compromise&quot;.  One side makes a suggestion that gives them total advantage, and the other side contradicts it with a suggestion that gives them  the advantage.  <br>
<br>
Is it such a sin to let something go wasted once in awhile?  Can't we maybe come to an agreement with those who are affected, and maybe pick a day once a week or once every two weeks where the plane goes unreserved to accommodate the European raiders?  Yes, true, one day a week (or two weeks, depending) the plane has mobs in it and no one to clear them.  Yes, the Europeans will need to make some concessions or get together to pick this day, and not everyone will be happy with it.  Yes, the North American time zones will have to deal with the fact that there are days that they just cannot have the plane, regardless of what item they want or need.<br>
<br>
Would that be a horrible idea?<br>

<br>
Second, can the compromise that Adune worked out satisfy the situation for SoT?<br>
<br>
Roatus going in earlier than 5 am pst on the 22nd, and your crew starting an hour later on the 22nd?<br>
<br>
SoT is going on a lot of faith here that Roatus will be done in a timely manner.  If his raid drags on, SoT could be in chat for hours waiting for the zone to repop, and that is not workable solution either.<br>
<br>
That being said, Adune has a point, even if Roatus sings up on the 22nd, he would face the same situation as whomever takes the 21st would likely end in such a maner as to force him to start later because his time zone is so far removed from the PST mean which affects his daily schedule.<br>

And it cuts his raid short by about 2hrs... but there have been several US guilds and raids that get cut short by 2+hrs alot.. the only difference is that we have an aditional buffer time that he does not.  This does not prevent him from raiding the plane and he may or may not run into repops.  he has just as much right to be there as any other us guild, but he is choosing to host his raid on a friday not on the thursday he signed up for.<br>
<br>
By shooting for 5am on friday the 22nd as his start time he holds the plane for 2 days, the thursday he singed up for which will pop at about 5am on thursday (~12hrs after SoH's start time)and not be cleared untill another 24hrs later...  then about 12hrs (thereby negating SoT's friday raid) after that the plane will spawn again.. this adds up to ~48hrs = 2days in the plane.<br>
<br>
This has little to do with majority minority raids bucause things can be worked out, or you can try for a weekend raid and coordinate with weekend raiders.  This dosn't limit the guilds that can go to the planes it just means trying to coordinate with a guild that can clear the plane in a very quick manner.. say SR or Watchers.. they can schedule and clear the armor droppers the night before in a very short amount of time and can start promptly. <p><IMG SRC="http://129.82.121.243/morkjl/eq/cazicmaal.jpg"><br>
