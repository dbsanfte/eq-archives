Time to start the planning. In order to take the city out they would need to work as one. Like a well oiled tinkered machine. They would need to move swiftly, and with stealth so as not the alert the enemy.<br>
Kat sat at her small table, Nospiratus across from her. Between them lay the map. It was well marked by them both. <br>
A descision was at hand. Should they first take out the northern part of the city? Or begin from deep within the southern part. Like a wound that festered from the inside out. <br>
&quot;If we move against the north first. There's a chance that one will make it to the south to warn of the coming attack. Giving them time to refortify themselves. However if we come from within and work our way out.. this point here could become a bottleneck.&quot; Kat pointed to the narrow ally they would have to go through to reach the north. <br>
&quot;Someone could slip past us and warn the north, They could then set up their ambush and bottleneck us in here.. Picking us off one at a time.&quot;<br>
&quot;My thoughts are to take out the North side first.. then disappear into the sewers instead of coming through this alley. The imbeciles would never think to watch for us there. We could either battle to this point here, where we had held our first foray? Or, we could use stealth to reach this point and with subterfuge slowly draw them into our web.&quot;<br>
She fell silent then looking up at him and waited for his input. &quot;We must do this soon Nospiratus, for this child will not wait till we are ready.&quot;<br>
Nospiratus nodded to her words, from his silence she knew he was mulling over all the aspects of this campaign. &quot;Word has reached me that Sir Lancelot will prove a daunting foe to us. Do we allow him to live Ma Vie? To take him we'll need our strongest warriors. And many of them. He has developed a strong immunity to all forms of magics. And his bite*,&quot; Nos shook his head,&quot; is ten times worse than his bark.&quot; <br>
Kat nodded at his words, &quot; This m'own we'll need to decide at the moment. It depends upon how many high ranking warriors we are able to bring with us. I would think those who know the way of discipline** will be needed to take him out. We'll also need clerics set up in a heal circle*** to continually keep the warrior who has his attention alive, till said warriors discipline is spent. At the same time.. we'll need one or two groups to handle any allies who may come to assist him.&quot;<br>
Nospiratus nodded at this, &quot;Aye Ma Vie, this will be no easy foe. We'll need to call not only upon the Chosen, but all our allies as well.&quot;<br>
&quot;Aye,&quot; she responded. &quot;Should we call others into our little planning session? Perhaps Vresk, Daiunus, Faeolin and Tzlar can shed some light upon this?&quot;<br>
Again he nodded, &quot;Aye them and Kasirath, Shaede and Zirrix as well.&quot; <br>
&quot;Aye m'own. We'll need all of them, if we are to successfuly take this city. And by Innoruuk's black heart. I mean to see Qeynos fall!&quot;<br>
&quot;Daiunus and Khasirath, i'm sure will be able to perhaps persuade our allies in joining us Ma Vie.&quot; Nos reassured her. &quot;That city will fall, for Innoruuk, and.. for us.&quot; <br>
She smiled at his words then stepped to the door to summon a servant. Word was sent then to those named to join herself and Nospiratus in confrence.<br>
&quot;Have you decided Ma Vie, what will be left standing?&quot; He asked her softly as she returned to sit beside him. &quot;Yes m'own, the bards guild, here.. &quot; She pointed to the spot on the map, &quot;It is out of our way, they shall be left to live. To tell of the Fall of Qeynos. To warn others that the reckoning is at hand. They will herald our deeds for years to come. But, &quot; she smiled up at him then, &quot; They will also be the ones to shelter our child. From them he shall learn many things. With them he will find sanctuary.&quot; Nos nodded to her words, his hand moving to give her own a gentle squeeze. <br>
&quot;When the others arrive Ma Vie, let me handle them. You are not exactly a diplomat, &quot; he chuckled softly as she grinned impishly at him. They both fell silent then waiting.. for the others. <br>

This is the Underdark, the secret world beneath the bustling surface of the Forgotten Realms, whose sky is a ceiling of heartless stone and whose walls show the gray blandness of death in the torchlight of the foolish surface-dwellers that stumble here. This is not thier world, nor the world of light. Most who come here uninvited do not return. <br>
Thos who do escape to the safety of their surface homes return changed. Their eyes have seen the shadows and the gloom, the inevitable doom of the Underdark.&quot;<br>

<br>
She paced from window to table, waiting ever waiting it seemed. Her gaze came to rest upon the dully lit courtyard below. No, this was not Neriak. The city of the dark elves. This was Katta Castellium. Their second home. <br>
They had worked hard to gain favor with the denizens of this twilight city. Had been finally granted a room in the home of Nathym Illuminious. It was here that they had begun to put together their plans for the invasion of Qeynos. <br>
She imagined it would take those summoned days to reach them. Some would need to enter the city under the cloak of stealth. While others would be able to boldly walk the streets. <br>
A soft chuckle from the hearth drew her impatient attention. &quot;They will come Ma Vei.&quot; Nos comforted her from his seat near the fire. A book was open in his lap. He had been studying it for some time though as yet had not shared what he learned from the old tome. It was not in Kat to pry.<br>
Her hands went to absently massage the dull ache in the small of her back as her gaze returned to the courtyard. Her mind reeling with so many things. The potential fall of the city she had long despised. The coming birth of their child. Their past and future collided. &quot;Aye,&quot; she whispered softly in reply, &quot;They will come.. &quot; She missed it, their home, Neriak. She missed the darkness, the shadows... the hatred.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unuthilyantalvaros.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NuthilyanTalvaros</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/5/02 9:56:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://212.212.159.240/wolf/imagesP/wolfh.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Qeynos Burning</span><hr size=1> Nuthilyan walked stealthily down the halls of Katta Castellum, well camoflaged and invisible to the untrained eye. He had been keeping a close watch on his aquaintances within the Violent Harvest, being welcome in most cities on Norrath this was not a very difficult thing for him to do. Luclin however, such a strange place it was. He turned a corner and walked directly into the path of a patrolling guard, quickly ducking to one side and pressing himself up against the nearest wall he held his breath till he was sure the guard had passed out of sight before moving again. As he was about to start creeping down the terraced walkway once more he heard a familiar voice. Concentrating on it he pressed his ear to the rough stone blocks that made up the imposing walls of Katta. Listening carfully he identified the two speakers as Tier`Dal, being fluent in their tongue, and heard of their plans to launch an assault on Qeynos. &quot;What of it?&quot; he mumbled to himself &quot;I have no love for the dimwitted humans who live past the plains of the Karanas, and yet i do see an oppertunity to make something profitable out of this.....&quot; lost in his own thoughts he quickly turned away from the walls and ran off silently into the darkness, heading towards the twilight sea. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showPrevMessage?topicID=557.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showNextMessage?topicID=557.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=2><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~eqmaximus/brell/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.threadControl?topicID=557.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=557.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=557.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm70">News and Events<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">The Outer Realm (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm56">The Hall of Honor<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">The Fellowship of Guilds<option value="brellserilisfrm53">The Valley of Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">The Back Alley (Link to Rants)<option value="brellserilisfrm71">Raids: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (BUYING)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Selling and Trading)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilisfrm69">The Moat<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying>The Tavern (Roleplaying)</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
