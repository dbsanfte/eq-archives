<br>
Elysium, also known as the Elysian Fields, in Greek mythology, a pre-Hellenic paradise, a land of perfect peace and happiness. In the works of Homer, Elysium was a land at the farthest and westernmost edge of the world to which the great heroes were carried, body and soul, and made immortal. There they were free to pursue their favorite activities, and worries and illness were unknown. Soon, however, Elysium came to be regarded as the abode of the blessed dead, where the souls of dead heroes, poets, priests, and others lived in perfect happiness, surrounded by grass, trees, and gentle winds and enveloped in rose-tinted, perpetual light.<br>
<br>
In Roman mythology, Elysium was a part of the underworld and a place of reward for the virtuous dead. For some it was only a temporary paradise. At the edge of its soft, green meadows flowed the Lethe, river of forgetfulness, from which all souls returning to life in the world above had to drink.<br>
==========================================================<br>
<br>
Ok, the first place i actually heard of Elysian Fields was actually in the play&quot; A Street Car Named Disire&quot;, its the apartment block Stella and Stanley live in , but I liked the name and then looked into it and above is a shorten version of what i found out. I have been using Elysian for about 20 years in gaming and other things, ICQ,mIRC,MUDS,etc..<br>
<br>
EQ: I was suprised that I could use Elysian as I have only started playing since Oct'99 and thought someone would of used it .. <br>
<br>
As to my surname: Wyvernsoul.. Fields was already used, so I tried Dragon~&lt;insert stuff like heart,soul,slayer,etc&gt; , all rejected, asked a GM why.. anyname with Dragon was either used or restrited..hhmm.. so the next best thing i could think of was Wyvern~... Wyvernheart was taken, so I ended up with Wyvernsoul.. <br>
<br>
<br>
((PS: I also beleive its a town in Southern Minnesota , but as I live in Australia, I am not that sure ))<br>

If I had known over a year later I would have way over 100 DAYS and 50 levels played on this character (it's the first one I created in this game) I would have spent more time coming up with something.<br>
<br>
My character's original surname was Dejecta. Around the time he reached level 20 the person that played his in game wife decided to no longer play that character, and in roleplaying her dying, it seemed appropriate (dejecta=brokenhearted.) After a while I decided to get rid of the surname though; I didn't want that one incident to dominate his life. So from about level 25 or so to level 50 I had no surname.<br>
<br>
At level 50 I decided to take on another surname. Gramosk' now long dead wife's name was Silvaris, so I decided to incorporate that into his surname. He is a member of the Koada'Vie, so I incorporated that. Lastly, I decided to use the name Elar (actually an anagram of the main character's name from a concept album from my favorite musical group.)<br>
<br>
So I put them together, originally as Elar'Vie'Sil, but later, when the gm told me I could only have one apostrophe, I modified that to Elarvie'Siil.<br>

I picked Sole, no real or good reason behind it, but it did have kind of a nice ring to it.  The problem I had with this name was a lot of spanish speaking people would talk to me (I don't speak Spanish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  When EQ came out, I decided it was time for a new name, and this time I let the name generator pick my name.  I wanted one that was easy to remember and easy to spell.  Sandain came up, it sounded like an elven paladin, so it stuck.  When I reached 20, I spent a while trying to figure out what I wanted my last name to be.  I wanted a name that not only went well with Sandain, but sounded like a name that a paladin would have.  Whiteblade came out of my think tank <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Paladins and white seem to go together, so the name stuck.  <br>

On a side note, my iksar monk is named Ssisler, a name from a Lizardman pet my Bard had in d&amp;d.  Ssisthler was the actuall name, but it must have been taken (odd)<br>

First off, I got into EQ because I heard it was a great online game. Also it was the fantasy role-playing type. Which I love. (ahhhh, AD&amp;D) <br>
<br>
Anyway, I started as my first character a Mage. At first it rocked; I felt powerful... Later on I hated everything. I died a lot and grouped with other people. I couldn't tank well or heal other members. I could only cast worthless spells. After lvl 5 or so I deleted him. (created him because I like role-playing a pure caster)<br>
<br>
Then came my Paladin. He was my second choice. (was always anyway if mage sucked) Since my mage was a high elf and I love the role play of a stuck up elf with honor/respect to others I choose a weak stick looking elf. Boy did I have a blast with this fellow. I choose the name Lynthalis for his name. I could tank so much better and heal with LoH. I was very respected as a newbie <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As I got older and grouped with people I knew; I aqquired new friends.

Siruriens was ok until my brother started playing and kept addressing me as, you guessed it, Sir Urine!  Well that lasted about one day, and since I was only lvl 2, I decided to bug out and start a new Paladin.<br>
<br>
I wanted a name associated with something of the Arthurian/Grail legends, but all the good names, Gawain, Yvain, etc. were taken.  As I was playing, I read the story of Sir Tristan and Iseult by Chretien de Troyes.  While reading I came upon the name of The Morholt.  The Morholt was the brother of the Queen of Ireland and uncle to Iseult the Fair.  He was also at the court of King Mark, King of Cornwall, trying to exact the last tribute (300 virgins, and 300 young men) that the King owed to the King of Ireland.  The tribute would be overlooked if any Knight of the Realm could defeat him in combat.<br>
<br>
Well, to make a long story short, Tristan defeated the Morholt on an island off the Cornwall coast.  I thought that the name sounded pretty Medieval, and kinda menacing.  When I created this current Paladin, I typed in the name, crossed my fingers, and expected a rejection.  Much to my pleasant surprise, it accepted it.<br>
<br>
I am only 4th lvl and have a ways to go to 20, so the last name has not even entered my mind yet, any suggestions?<br>

<br>
Well, I have been an avid D&amp;D gamer for many years.  I love coming up with names and now can tell you the tale of my name.<br>
<br>
Well it started off when my brother had played in beta and when EQ came out we bought it together.  Paladins are my first choice of character, but he said that we should try to play a druid/ranger combination for EQ.  So I said okay.  But that wasn't until about 2 weeks into playing because he wanted me to get used to playing the game before we made characters together.  He also told me to try to play a caster class first because they are the toughest to learn.  So knowing I was probably gonna just kill this character anyways I made a gnome wizard.  I know that gnomes usually have long names that are pretty ridiculous and always need to be shortened I named him Dren.  Then as soon as I got into the game I made sure to tell everyone in OOC what my full name was and that I was happy to meet them!  (this was still the beginning before all that flying chat became truly annoying)  Anyhow his full name was Drenvolanciofulous.  I of course hadn't come up with a last name, because I knew he was a temporary character.  So when the time came to make the druid and ranger characters we were going to play I told him I would play the druid, since they got the teleportation spells and were able to bind themselves.  He said ok, and then I needed to name him.  Well it was also around that time I was witnessing the Tennessee Volunteers football team become #1 in the nation on the collegiate level.  I heard how they kept calling them the &quot;Vols&quot;. I liked it.  So I took the name Drenvolanciofulous and broke it apart to just Volancio and knew that people would shorten the name even further in game and the most logical breakdown would be Vol.  So there you have my character Volancio's name.<br>
<br>
Now onto my alternate character, my paladin, since we have switched servers multiple times now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My brother and I don't really play together anymore since he has way more time than me, so he isn't too high level, but I still like him.  I was trying to think of all the really honorable names I could think of.  But for the first time, I couldn't come up with anything, and for some reason, the rememberance of my late great grandfather came to mind.  His name was Leo.  So I knew I had found it, because what a great man he was.  I would be proud to carry my Paladin's name as Leo, but as we all know we need more than 3 letters for EQ, so he is fondly known to me as Leoh Lifewarden.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/ulaike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/10/00 5:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How did you get your Paladin name?</span><hr size=1> well Laike came from the game Lunar Silver Star.  Laike is actually the Alias of the old DragonMaster named Dyne.  The Reason why i chose Laike instead of Dyne is because Laike is the after effect of Dyne when he sacrificed his powers to save Althena from an untimely death, Dyne took the risk of doing that to save the one he loved, and i feel that Laike symbolizes the person that has done the sacrifice and feels no regret and that's what i feel a paladin is all about.<br>

My Last name Spirit'Tear has a self made up backround.  And simply put i think that a spirit only cries when something overly emotional happens and it's been said (by me, hehe) that with a spirit's tear you can mend any wound no matter the extent of it's damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/umerkvah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merkvah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/11/00 7:43:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Rebel namer, You're a LOON</span><hr size=1> Why do you automatically pronounce his name the way you would if you were playing something again?  why not call him (RiP-lAy) or something like that?<br>

YOU ARE OFFENDED BY THE NAME PROMISEKEEPER?  Should folks who's names are Redbeard or Gravelbeard change their names because you are a woman and are offended by the idea of facial hair???

Merkvah is a Hebrew word meaning Chariot.  it is also the name of the main battle tank of Israel.  I picked it because God told the Jews not to use chariots to defeat their enemies - he would fight for them.  <br>
<br>
Are you offended?<br>
<br>
My last name is Holyblade.  surely that offends you, with it's blatant religious reference.  Please, come to tallon zek and petition that a GM change it.<br>

<br>
Several years before EQ was even a dream, I read a series of books entitled &quot;The Deed of Paksenarrion&quot;, which forever changed my outlook on Paladins. Tamarrion was the name of a character in the book- she had died before the time the tale takes place, so you never really &quot;meet&quot; or &quot;know&quot; her. <br>
<br>
Some time not long after I read the trilogy, our GM started a new AD&amp;D campaign. I was still psyched by the book, and decided to play a Paladin. Paks was my role-model for the character, but I didn't want to be so blatant. I liked the name Tamarrion, so I used that. In the game, Barith was my character's father- just a simple farmer, so a &quot;commoner&quot; name was appropriate. Hence, &quot;Barithsdotter&quot;.<br>
<br>
When EQ came along, I couldn't pass up the chance to play what has become my favourite class- the Paladin. Tam was the only choice for me, when it came time to chose my name.<br>
