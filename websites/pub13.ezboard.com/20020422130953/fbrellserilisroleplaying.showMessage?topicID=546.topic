He got up to find where it was coming from and realized he was lying on the ground in the middle ofthe freeport arena. When he stood up he felt a sharp pain shoot up the back of his neck.. and he thought to himself, i must have been knocked out again trying to get back to the Hall of truth by that dang guard inofus!! <br>He walked into the jail to get out of the arena and again hurd the voice, &quot;Bugs goo and blanket too&quot; He turned the corner into the jail and saw a ragged old prisoner in the cell! He must be mad, thought Brios. What kind of prisoner would be mumbling about goo and blankets? <br>Something strange must be going on.. I know ive heard that phrase somewhere.. I better go talk to Kalatrina Plossen In the hall of truth, She'll know what this is about. <br>When Sir Brios arrived at the hall of truth he was tired and nervous from just sneaking past all the guards, but he managed to walk up the stairs to the roof to talk to his guildmaster, Lady Kalatrina Plossen. &quot;Do you know anything about a prisoner in the West freeport arena that is mad and always mentioning bugs and goo?&quot; said Brios. &quot;Hmm.. well i dont know but i shall have a spy sent to the freeport militia house right away, maybe if you can get there before him you can find something out, if not give him this note and say .. Truth is good.. and he will open up to you.&quot; &quot;Ok I will.&quot; Replied Brios, I will head out immediatly, Thankyou Milady. <br><br><br>CHAPTER 2: Ariska Zimel<br><br>As Brios walked out the door of his guildhouse and home, The Hall of Truth, he bumped into his Close Friend and guildmate Sir Ijest the druid. &quot;Hail Brother Ijest&quot; said Brios, I am on a quest for Lady Kalatrina, Could you spare a Superior Camoflouge for my trek through West Freeport?&quot; &quot;Of course brother, I am always willing to aid you&quot; Replied Ijest. <br>So Sir Brios Cometfyre got his invisibility and headed out.<br>***<br>A few hours later he arrived in the courtyard of the freeport militia building, and carefully looked around before disabiling his invisibilty spell. He approached a strange looking guard who didnt have a name imprinted on his Helm as all the other guards did, so Brios quietly approached him and said &quot;Truth is Good.&quot; <br>Startled the &quot;Guard&quot; look Brios in the eye and said &quot;Shhhh!! Quiet down if the guards here you t'will be the death of both of us! Why are you here? kalatrina must have sent you, she is the only one who knew the code. What business have you come for?!!&quot;<br>Brios Looked around him carefully then proceeded to pull out a thin peice of parchment with the seal of the Hall of truth on it, He handed it to the still nameless guard/paladin and watched him peel it open.. He gasped and handed Brios another note.. But this time it had the seal of the Temple of Marr on it. Brios Quickly grabbed it, thanked the guard and began to leave.<br>As soon as Sir Brios opened the door into the building Brother Jentry.. Sir Lucans D'lere's Brother and bodygaurd, Burst into the courtyard with a small squadron of gaurds behind him and pointed at the Spy sent by kalatrina and bellowed &quot; KILL him, he is a spy sent bye the damned paladins that have been holding us out of North Freeport for years!!<br>The courtyard filled with guard and the spy was quickly slain, but he had managed to kill 7 of the guards, during this process Brios had slipped over the wall of the fort and was already on his was back to kalatrina With the note mysteriously labeled, Ariska Zimel.<br><br><br>CHAPTER 3: Zimels Blades, Ariska Zimel<br><br><br>Once Brios got back to North Freeport he slowed down to a walk again.. he hated those guards and would do anything to end their reign over the citizens of Freeport! He was heading towards The Hall of Truth thinking about all of this when he slammed into a little dwarf. The note fell out of Brios's pocketed and the dwarf, seeing the seal, quickly grabbed it and begain to read it.<br>The look in the dwarfs eyes as he read the note was that of pure horror and amazement.. his long lost (and thought dead) theiving companion was aliving and living in the West Freeport arena prison! The dwarf looked up and showed Brios the message, (it looked something like this) Z..... ......M......... .....L ....B...L....D....S........ A...R..k..a...!<br>Brios looked at the note, then back up at the dwarf, and suddenly burst out laughing. The guard had said it was important, the dwarf was crying and showing such strong emotions at it, then he looks at it and it is nothing but a jumble of random letters and dots!!!<br>What is all this??! Said brios. &quot;Are you trying to mock me??&quot;<br>&quot;No I am not.. i can not say anything more here.. meet me tonight at the tavern at the docks in East Freeport at 8:00!<br>As soon as the dwarf was finished talking he began casting a spell witch caused these strange caustic bubbles to surround him.. Brios reached out to stop him but suddenly the dwarf had completely dissiapeared! and not only that, he had disiapeared to another place.. he was not invisible, he was gone!<br>Brios sighed and began to head toward the dock. By the time he got there it was almost 8 so he bought a few ales for him and the dwarf and sat down and waited...<br>***<br>About 2 hours later the dwarf walked into the room with a big gash on his forehead and red cloth hanging from his boots, it looked like militia Uniform cloth. Brios asked him about his condition but the dwarf shook his head and pointed to the note in Brios's Pocket.<br>Brios Removed the note and handed the dwarf the note.. The dwarf pulled a quill out of his beard and began scribbling on the note. &quot;Dont ruin it! I need it to finish my quest and to show Kalatrina!&quot; Said Brios.<br>&quot;I am not ruining it, Shut up human and let me consentrate.&quot;<br>After 10 minutes of scratching his beard mumbling and writing on the note he sighed and handed it to Brios.. This is what is looked like. Z.I.M.E.L.S B.L.A.D.E.S. Ariska Zimel......Bugs.. Goo. Blanket too.. FRIEND!<br>Brios shook his head looking confused, &quot;Zimels Blades? Ariska Zimel? Bugs and goo blanket too, what does it all mean?? Brios looked up at the dwarf and to his amazement he was gone! Brios stood up to head back to The Hall of Truth and see if Kalatrina could make sence of it, when he felt some poking around at the back of his armor where his pack was.. he drew his Argent Defender and spun around.. sword at the neck of the theif! <br><br><br>CHAPTER 4: Bugs, Goo and Blanket Too.<br><br>It was a Poor old begger holding a blanket made of wool and with a little insignia at the bottom that read.. A.Z. <br>***<br>Brios Realized suddenly that the note said bugs good and blanket too! That was what that prisoner in the arena was muttering.. His name must be ariska zimel and he must have owned Zimels Blades, if that is so this is why kalatrina told me I was in search of a holy sword!! Hmmm i better get some bugs goo and blanket too. maybe that will get that old prisoner to open up to me. Brios looked at the Theif and said &quot;Who are you? Where is ariska? Why do you have his blanket?&quot;<br>The thief pointed at Brios's ale and nodded. Brios gave him an ale and the prisoner quickly drank it down. &quot;More, more my tongue is still not lose.&quot; Said the theif.<br>Brios gave him more and once again the thief said &quot;More more i have returned from a journey and my tongue is still quiet dry&quot;<br>Brios repeatead this process 4 times before the thief finally began to talk.<br>&quot;I was Ariska's partner, i ran Zimels blades with him and we were also &quot;partners in crime&quot;. We where friends from childhood, until one day that FOOL and I were on a mission to kill Sir Reskin, that drunk guard that hangs out at the inn in EC and sucks up to Sargeant Slate. When we arrived and killed Reskin he grabbed the helmet and the money and the weapons and ran off with it all, not sharing any.. He was cought with it all a few years ago and thrown in jail. Since you helped me with the ail, take this maybe it will help you&quot; Said the theif, and handed Brios the blanket.<br>&quot;Ariska always liked Edible Goo and bug juice to eat while lying under his warm wool blanket, maybe this will help you.&quot; whispered the thief to Brios.<br>Brios walked off toward the Hall of Truth, blanket under his arm, note in his pack, thinking about all the strange things that had happened since he had woken up in the arena 2 days ago. <p>Brios Cometfyre<br>52 Cavalier of Erollisi<br>Fellowship Of Valor<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jayzee03/gnomized.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/jayzee03/gnomized.JPG" border="0"></a> <br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrioscometfyre01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brios Cometfyre01</A> at: 4/4/02 12:43:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#403C50><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubrioscometfyre01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brios Cometfyre01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/02 1:31:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soulfire..The Quest For Glory!</span><hr size=1> I think a older version of this story from like 1999 is on page 20 of this Roleplaying section, but i got bored, edited it, and added some of my higher EQ knowledge into it, but i still tried to keep the attitude i had back in the 20's-30's <p>Brios Cometfyre<br>52 Cavalier of Erollisi<br>Fellowship Of Valor<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/jayzee03/gnomized.JPG" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.geocities.com/jayzee03/gnomized.JPG" border="0"></a> <br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#464446><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uzantesdarkwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zantes Darkwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ye Olde Gimp</span><br>  Posts: 262<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/4/02 10:58:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisroleplaying.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.orderofseibwen.com/picstorage/americanflag.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soulfire..The Quest For Glory!</span><hr size=1> Hey that was great B!
