Part 2</span><hr size=1> Eensy, Gnomish Renegade Part Two: Training and Trails<br>
Eensy, the little gnome, spent a few months in Felwithe before she left.  In that time, Ezia, the elf that had invited her to stay, taught, or rather tried to teach, the gnome healing arts and the Will of Tunare.  Eensy made it very vocal the only faith she held was in her dagger, however.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was at this time that Ezia noticed something off about Eensy’s dagger, how it was curved, and looked fragile, but sharp.  It was then she realized Eensy’s “dagger” was nothing more than part of a drachnid’s leg.  Thinking it did not offer the gnome enough protection, especially in the harsh wilds of Norrath, the weapon was too curved and knotted to be thrust as quickly as a dagger, plus the smell seemingly attracted monsters, Ezia decided to offer Eensy her family’s legendary dagger, Ozin’Rato, which was ancient elvish for  “Jagged Diamond.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The weapon had been given to Ezia’s family by a wood elven rogue named Ponair Shadowlurker, and the weapon could not be wielded by anyone in her family for it was against their code to wield such a destructive weapon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eensy gratefully accepted the weapon, and spent many days practicing with it.  The small gnome found it difficult to keep up with her elemental training partner with only one weapon, so one day she bought a second dagger, also rumored to be legendary weapon, only this one had an evil soul within it.  The evil soul within the dagger gave the dagger a special power, the power of the Blood Claw, and it felt a power within the small gnome, a power it could feed off of.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her training was rigorous, the elementals summoned by Ezia’s sister, a magician, grew stronger and stronger, and even changed element.  One day she could be fighting a fire elemental, being careful not to linger in one place for fear of fire, another day she could be dodging the sinking touch of an earth elemental.  The training was truly rigorous, for as the days went on, Ezia’s sister (Eensy never learned her name) began throwing fireballs at her to “keep her on her toes,” it worked, she went through many suits of melted armor in those months, until she stumbled upon a suit of armor worn by the Ry’Gorr chiefs and the lizardmen of Cazic Thule, known as “Ry’Gorr chain” and “Ravenscale.”  She wore this armor proudly; it gave her the significant protection to withstand the mage’s fireballs, and magically altered her agility enough to dodge the elemental’s attacks faster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After her months of training and eating with Ezia’s family, she knew it was time she moved on, to the west.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Let me come with you,” Ezia asked her the day she decided to leave.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No, the road will be dangerous, you could get hurt,” Eensy replied, showing the characteristic ice cold face along with uncharacteristic concern for her new friend’s safety.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I want to go with you! I need to see the world!  My Goddess demands it!” Ezia pleaded.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “…Very well, you may come along, just don’t get in the way, and don’t complain to me if you get hurt,” Eensy said to her friend, “and I’ll only take you as far as Freeport, the rest of my path may get you killed, nay, it will get you killed if you come along.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I understand, I won’t get in your way.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And so, Eensy and Ezia left Felwithe behind, and went forward towards the Butcherblock Mountains, realm of the dwarves.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They were walking along the road, the path that lead to the boat they would ride across the sea to Freeport, when they saw a curious sight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A feeble dark elf, with a distorted face, was standing before two rough looking dwarf guards, both with spears pointed towards the dark elf.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh my!  We have to help!” Ezia exclaimed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Which one?  The dwarves may be causing trouble for the Dark Elf,” Eensy questioned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “HA!” the dark elf exclaimed, “I am Taluvan!  The most powerful and godlike necromancer in all Norrath!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was at this time that Eensy, Ezia, and the two dwarf guards realized “Taluvan” was wearing a shabby tuxedo; two pieces of black paper put over some spectacles, and was carrying a shoddy and perforated suitcase.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I am here to help out any babes that need help!  And I heard you two have a Dark Elf babe locked up!” Taluvan said, his voice whiny and high pitched.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yar!  We locked up an inky girl, she stole th’ cash from a travelin’ merchant!” one of the dwarves bellowed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have come to free her!  For no babe should be locked up!” the whiny voiced necromancer replied, “and there’s nothing you can do because I have a tuxedo and dark sunglasses and carry a briefcase!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After saying this, Eensy and the two dwarven guards had had enough with his whiny voice and (apparently the whino had been talking like this more around the guards, or they just had a temper as short as Eensy’s) jumped the feeble elf and hog tied him, then attached him to one of Eensy’s tinkered rockets, and blasted him to the stratosphere.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After dealing with the pathetic elf, the dwarves allowed Eensy and Ezia a room to stay in at an inn in Kaladim, as guests of the royal guard of King Stormhammer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Later, Eensy found out that this Taluvan had been causing trouble and Eensy wasn’t the first to humble him…<br>
<br>
To be continued in “Eensy, Gnomish Renegade #3!”<br>
