Finding the niche in the raid role was what helped Paladins out a lot.  Sure we can't tank Lord Goofydragon or be in the heal chain but we have a useful place.  I get snatched up all the time in group forming for raids because (quoting from a Cleric) &quot;...having you in my group is so easy on my mana!&quot;  And in pinch situations I still believe Druid-Paladin combo healing is very viable.<br>
<br>
The one thing I wanted to point out that although I really do believe Druids need help they don't need as much help they are asking for in their petition.  If you believed their petition they are completely helpless. ^_^<br>
<br>
I really do believe that you can't ask for it all.  Asking for massive heals and massive damage is wrong.  Or at the very least gives less creditablity and appears more like a &quot;class whine&quot;.<br>
<br>
Caster damage in general seems broken.  Unless you are a Wizard you often have hard times getting your damage to stick.  If this doesn't seem odd to you think about the new Cazic-Thule.  We as Paladins are having known issues with just stunning them.  At least we can still beat up the monster with our melee.  Where would a class with their primary mode of damage being their spells do?  Hopefully if Verant delivers on their promise to help Casters out in general this problem will go away (or probalby change into something more workable).<br>
<br>
I forgot who said it here but healing is all about efficiency.  NT is kind of clunky as is for 880 HP for 400 mana(remember CC is 775 HP for 225 mana &quot;by the book&quot;).  I wouldn't mind it at all if it was tweaked to be more timely and/or mana efficient.<br>
<br>
However I don't think Druids are really going to enjoy a group heal and a better NT and a HOT. ^_^ Ask any Cleric.  They have *a lot* of good heals and they can only afford the time and slots to do some.  Druids should try to pick one type.  I'm behind fixing up NT because that would give them a niche in raids.  Looking after non-tank hit points would be an interesting job to take on I believe and giving them a viable point heal would work great.<br>
<br>
Also keep the amount of trolling and flaming down if you visit Druids Grove.  There is their share of &quot;anti-pov&quot; but there are also those who are open minded.  I want to see Druids get fixed up and not get flustered if their attempt to draw attention falls flat.<br>
<br>
And if you are a Druid reading this please be proud but be humble. ^_^ <p><font size="+1">

I have seen all kinds of people in all classes. I don't think until you have had the experience yourself, you understand what it's like to receive dozens of tells asking for ports, sows, and PLing every night in every zone for a couple years. I do my best to be polite to everyone, but its not uncommon for me to get a rude response when all I reply is &quot;I'm sorry, I'm grouped right now&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry, I can't right now.&quot; I'm not sure why it is, but the rangers I know don't get deluged with tells for sows and the mages don't get begged for their ds. I have had many, many people tell me that they have a druid alt for PLing and travel and farming purposes and that their main is another class who needed the help of their druid, so some of those druids out there that you are unhappy with are actually warriors and paladins and clerics and chanters. It's true that druids are probably the easiest class to solo (although necros are pretty good at it too), so people who like to solo are probably drawn to that class.<br>
<br>
I have always been a grouping druid and played with my husband's cleric since lvl 1. I have always thought it was unfair that druid and shaman can sow, but that cleric can't, after all, they are all priest class. And I think the post50 game is and always been broken to a certain extent as far as class balance, I think all classes find that the game changes for them and that a great deal of boring raids is part of the endgame instead of just experience hunts.<br>
<br>
I am pretty happy with my role as backup healer in a group, as often as not I am healing the chanter and other casters, but sometimes I am slapping on a heal on a tank because the CH isn't going to hit in time. I also have my nukes and I am often enough grouped where we are missing either a chanter or a shaman, where I am using spells like DS or str buffs that I would otherwise not be asked for.<br>
<br>
I think the thing that has come up for me more than anything else the whole time I've been a druid is that I have a whole bunch of spells that are outdoor only, while a lot of the cool places in the game are indoor dungeons. It would have been nice to try harmony in one of those dungeons.<br>
<br>
I have paladin friends who are now happily making money doing rezzes for donations, and I don't begrudge them a bit of it, there were never enough clerics around to do all the rezzing, I only wish they had gotten it sooner. Thanks to all in this thread who have said that not all druids are a$$holes and that not all a$$holes are druids.<br>

If you had to remove ch and tone down mob mele, you should also either grant cleric/warriors some improvements or downgrade druids and hybrids.<br>
<br>
The big issue with improving druid healing is that in most places druids are already better than druids for the healing spot (specially if hteres slower available). Increase even more druid heals, and they not only are top soloers but will also become the preferred xp group healers. And this combination (top soloing/preferrred healer in group) is not only overpowering, but it nerfs into oblivion the niche in xp groups clerics have.<br>
<br>
That petition asks druids to be 2nd healers DAMN close to clerics, 2nd dotters DAMN close to whoever holds the dot crown, and also asks for increasing the already extremely nice druid debuff line. Thats clearly unbalancing and overpowering. What will be next? defensive disc, self ch and manaless manaburn for one-druid-ntov raids? Realize that most classes have a limited role in the high end raiding game, and if some are required in masse is mostly due to verants poor design. Realize that there must be some kind of balance between classes, between soloing and grouping. Finally realize that druids are already a damn nice rounded class, and realize also that the petition just is another step in the druid tradition of belitling themselves to whine for upgrades. You are not a useless class, no matter what the glade moderators want you to believe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=orun>Orun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/8/02 3:24:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15171.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> -_-</span><hr size=1> PoTG please O_x<br>

<br>
The important distinction that needs to be made for druids is raid vs non-raid.<br>
<br>
Currently, non-raid... druids are fine.  A few things would be nice, like the Nexus port.  The epic effect isn't super useful... but then, only a few really are.  They tend to be healers... that and snare are why they get added to groups, SoW at lower levels.  Their dots are hard to resist and provide plenty of damage.  Groupwise, they can keep a group healed.  Not as well as a shaman, but that's because the shaman can slow.  Give the druid a slower though and you are fine.  CH is simply not necessary.  Without CH though, you are better off with a slightly more melee heavy group and dividing damage so that regen is most effecient.<br>
<br>
I run a paladin/enchanter combo.  With that, the paladin pulls, heals, buffs (all but symbol, though AC buff comes from BP), and fights.  He doesn't sit and med.  Matter of fact, adding a shaman or cleric to my group is less effecient in many areas because the healing/slowing power isn't needed.<br>
<br>
But on raids... here druids suffer.  A druid isn't a wizard.  And a druid isn't a cleric.  Wizards do insane damage.  They get resisted less and have a much better selection of nukes to choose from with AA abilities that help them out.  Clerics have complete heal.  Now, druids do get a couple of useful buffs/debuffs.  But that's a 1 druid job.  All the rest spend their time not being wizards or clerics.<br>
<br>
Do I think druids should get a group heal?  No.  No way.  This ability is what makes paladins very nice on raids.  Give it to druids and paladins suffer.  The wrong class to cut into for raid desirability.<br>
<br>
I do think that druids need an improvement in healing.  Single target healing.  Because it is the cleric who's must have factor needs to be cut in to.  The first change to make would be to lower the level 60 heal to 57 or 58.  The second would be something to cut into the CH dependency.<br>
<br>
A percentage heal would be nice, if Verant's engine can handle that (which I doubt... notice CH is 10k, not 100%).  So assuming that isn't possible, something like a 2800 point heal, 10 second cast, 400 mana, at level 60.  It's a nice heal, 7:1 effecient.  But not enough to heal a main tank from the pummelling of a major mob.  What this means is that it takes 2 druids to equal 1 cleric on a raid in the healing role.<br>
<br>
Does this hurt the desirability of clerics in xp groups?  Probably.  You already don't need clerics in many areas.  Giving druids a better heal makes them more desirable.  Should clerics be compensated for it?  That's another question.  And the answer is yes.  Don't ask me exactly how... but it should be something that gives them some versatility in xp groups, without touching upon their raid desirability.  Another option would be to make this druid heal take a pearl each cast.  A minor cost for a raid.  But adds up fast for xp groups.  That way, the druid heal becomes a big boss mob heal only. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=15171.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=15171.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15171.topic&index=60><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.emailToFriend?topicID=15171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.threadControl?topicID=15171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15171.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=15171.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral>General</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
