<br>
&quot;Then let me sing a dirge!&quot; Cerres slammed the music stand sending  Jonathan's Victory March flying across the room.  &quot;My father is dead, my mother is insane, and you expect me to sing a celebration!&quot;  Cerres kicked the fallen stand and it collided with the small harp, sending atonal echoes from the vaulted ceiling to the hard stone floor.<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver watched, his arms folded and his face expressionless.  Tears flew from Cerres eyes as she punished the walls for their lack of compassion and tossed pillows about  for not wailing in her greif.  Spent, Cerres looked at Master Songweaver and waited.  The harper stood silently - a boulder in the midst of a rushing river, smooth from decades of water flowing over it; impassive, immovable.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well?&quot;  Cerres asked, the silence unbearable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you quite finished?&quot; Master Songweaver asked, his tone undecipherable.  <br>
<br>
Cerres kicked her loot case across the floor.  &quot;There.  Now I'm finished,&quot; she said, her jaw set in defiance.  <br>
<br>
Master Songweaver grunted slightly as he bent over the bulk of his stomach to pick up the scattered sheets of music.  He righted the music stand, placed the music on it, picked up a pencil and marked.  &quot;You must breath here, not in the middle of the crescendo.  And the you missed the tempo change.  5/6 not 3/4.  From the fourth measure, page 2 please.  Inta laeboueta froo.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You really expect me to sing now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's what you're here for.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But look at me. Don't you see the state I'm in?&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver chuckled.  &quot;I see the state the room is in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't possibly sing right now.  Not this!&quot;  Cerres pointed to the sheet music in front of her.<br>
<br>
Wiping his hands on his robe, Master Songweaver replied, shaking his head slowly.  &quot;That is  a pity.  Such a beautiful voice.  And Katrina will miss you terribly.  She's grown quite attached you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not leaving.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are if you won't sing.  This is not a hotel for young aristocrats whose caretakers are out of town.&quot;  Master Songweaver sat down at the harp and began tuning it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, Master.  I'll pull myself together.  I can sing this tomorrow.  I'll memorize the breaths.  Please,&quot; Cerres pleaded.<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver plucked a string. He turned a peg.  B sharp slid into C.  He plucked the C an octave higher and an octave lower and listend to the grating resonance.  He reached for the lower peg.<br>
<br>
&quot;Inta laeboueta froo&quot; Cerres began, sobbing with each breath until she had painstakingly and painfully, to Master Songweaver's ears, completed the Celebration.<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver got up from his harp.  Cerres watched as he moved with slow deliberation  to the bench usually occupied by proud parents as they watched their children perform for their entry exams to the Academy.   The harper replaced the pillow, sat down, and patted the seat next to him.  &quot;Come sit.&quot; <br>
<br>
Cerres obediently sat down, still shaking from the flood of raw emotion.  Master Songweaver took her hands in his and looked into her eyes.  Cerres waited patiently, shifting nervously from his scrutiny and yet unwilling to turn away.  &quot;Why do you sing?&quot; the harper finally asked.<br>
<br>
Cerres pondered the question.  She'd never thought about it before.  She had always sung, just as she had always breathed.   &quot;I  just have to.  If I don't, I'll burst.&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver smiled a cryptic smile and nodded knowingly.  &quot;And why will you burst?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cerres thought back to her spontaneous outbursts of song.  She rememberd the wailing lament at Cyris' ordination.  &quot;My soul is crying out, Master.  I must express my emotions and I express them in song.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Master Songweaver looked around the still disheveled room and laughed.  &quot;Not all of them it seems.&quot;  Cerres looked at the floor, embarassed by her outburst.  &quot;And the masters, why did they write the songs?&quot; he continued.<br>
<br>
&quot;To express their souls?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And why does the audience pay to hear you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know.  Because they like music I guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver sighed despairingly.  &quot;Ahh, I see.  Only musicians have souls.  Only musicians have emotions.   Everyone else just likes the pretty tunes?&quot;  Cerres blushed.<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver continued.  &quot;When you sing the masters, their souls call out to you and fill you with emotion.  When an audience hears you sing, your voice expressing the music calls out to them, it stirs their souls and fills them with emotion.  But this will only happen if you stay true to the soul of the masters whose works you are singing.  Do you understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you must SING it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But that's cruel.  It's cruel to ask someone filled with grief to sing of joy, someone realing from the sting of rejection to sing of love.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, it is.  But, Cerres, every gift comes with a price.&quot;  The master squeezed her hands.  &quot;Is it any more cruel than to ask the warrior to fight when he is afraid?  Ot to ask the preist to heal when he is wounded?  Or the druidess to evacuate others while abandoning her lover?&quot;<br>
<br>
Shot from the bow of a master, chagrin carried its message deep into Cerres' heart.  Profound shame reddened her face and softened her voice.   She whispered, &quot;How?  How do I change from despair to joy and correct the course of my emotions to fit the music?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Start with the libretto.  Every night, another child dead by an assassin's knife.  The Glade  filled with black ribbons, every family mourning its loss.   A great and horrible battle as the forces of Tunare, the Marr's and Rodcet Knife join to banish the Tier'Dal minions from their lands.  Hundreds die, and hundreds more port in to take their place.  Women with suckling babes carry pitchforks into battle instead of into the fields.  And while hundreds of children of light return their blood to the earth mother, the Tier'Dal are defeated by the thousands, finally crawling on their bellies back under their rocks and praying for mercy from an unmerciful god.  The black ribbons are stripped from the trees in the Glade, each painted with a red stripe for the blood returned to the mother.  The soldiers tie the cloths to their helmets, their arms, their sheilds.  And the army begins its victorious march across Antonica.  An army of thousands in a sea of red and black&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver stood and began the Victory March, his baritone voice recreating the scene.  Parents returning home victorious, bringing peace.  No more mothers would send their sons off to die.  No more children assassinated in the night.  The walls of the music chamber reverberated with joy, pride, and the relief that only peace can bring.  Cerres felt herself  swept up into the arms of the song.  She was carried by the thousands of soldiers marching home victorious.  She added her soprano to the harpers baritone and  as they finished the song, they embraced as brothers after a long, hard fought battle.<br>
<br>
Tears welling in his eyes, the harper looked down at Cerres.  &quot;Now, why do you sing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To reach the souls of others.&quot;<br>
<br>
Master Songweaver indulged himself in a self-congratulatory smile.  &quot;Fourth measure, page 2 please.  Inta laeboueta froo.&quot;<br>
