(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Dont wanna waste too much time this time. But as a level 60 druid over 1 year, along with 56 cleric, I should say more words, I hope you will feel what I'm saying is unbaised at all (Please refer to my post in page 13 under this thread)<br>
<br>
1. Druid should NOT be enough to support a group well enough on healing duties if mob is AEing. Yes, this makes the game fun. If we do can make it, or with our similar situation friend, shamen, then raids will be just too easy, All the clerics just put their eyes on the MT, other groups all attached with a druid/shaman/pally/some clerics don't wanna do out CH duty then everyone is fine. The fact that clerics may still need to after some of the groupmates along with druid/shamen makes the game fun.<br>
<br>
2. It is verant's idea to make warrior the tank, cleric the healer. Pally/SK can't challenge even close enough to be as good tank as Warriors on High-end raiding, similar to druid/shamen couldn't get even close enough to be as good as cleric on healing. They made only one difference mainly on each. Defensive on warrior, and CH on cleric.<br>
<br>
No matter how you ask for a fix, it won't be enough. As a grouping druid, you have to learn how you use your mana efficiently and what kind of role you need to play in a group, from very low levels to level 60. That's our lives, AS IT IS THE CHALLENGE FOR US, THIS MAKE MORE FUN THAN PLAYING A SPECIALIZED CLASS SUCH AS CLERICS. Why I enjoy a druid is becuase her various ability, provided that every of them are not good enough. I need to learn what to do throughout the fight on inc an UBBER MOB. AND THROUGHOUT THE FIGHT, WE HAVE PLAYED MANY DIFFERENT ROLES. Make your spells ready.<br>
<br>
1. Before the fight, we gotto buff with PoTG/Circle of Seasons/Circle of Summer/Regrowth of the Grove and maybe Legacy of Thorn (if mage didn't do all on Aegis of Ro), 5 buffs memmed, 5 buffs unmemmed when I gotto start.<br>
<br>
2. During the early stage of the the fight, as it takes a while the debuffers to tash/malo/cripple whatever and slow (if possilbe) At this stage, it is so easy to lose our Main tank, debuffer while they got aggro, chain CH clerics while one of them healed just too much. Using /assist /assist /chloroblast saves a lot of lives. Yes, 1 druid prolly didn't work out much on this, but assume you have 4 druids in the ubber raid and all of them should do the same thing, so it is not a heal of 385 in 3 seconds, but a heal of 1540 in 3 seconds. A few clerics can surely help on remedy or divine light when MT losing aggro. Add up our druids' effort to support one who took hit, we could make an important role here already.<br>
<br>
3. While things seem to be set (mob got debuffed/slowed, or just the MT stick well on aggro with chain CH clerics doing their job), now we start our ubber fire debuff, open the road for wizzy/mages and ourselves when we need to nuke. Do you think it's not important at all? I definately think it's important, chain CH clerics must go OOM soon even with bard/c3/5mana rod for clerics/PoTG/necro mana etc. And warrior (MT) may need to change on tanking while their 3-min defensive wore off. Shortening the fight duration helps a lot, that's why we got a role here.<br>
<br>
4. On later stage, we start nuking Wildfire/Moonfire (or Frost), they are not very ubber nuke but you can deal around 1k damage on each nuke. Not bad at all.<br>
<br>
Tell me a class you can find you got so many roles during the whole process of the ubber fight.<br>
<br>
A few suggestions I'll make on the fix of us (druid classes):<br>
<br>
1. Clerics got Blessing of Aegolism/Marzin Mark (Sol 60 spell), Shamen got Kharass Focusing (Sol 60 spell), Enchanter got c3 (Sol 60 spell), what druids get? Don't forget we 4 Cleric/Shaman/Enchanter/Druid are the 4 main buffers from low levels to high-end. Circle of Season is a gift, but it is just similar to shaman's new group regrowth spell from luclin.<br>
<br>
We need a fix here. PoTG rocks but is it useful when our level 60 buffs be overwritten by the cleric level 60 buffs and make us obsolote? Please, I would like to see the group buffs from all 4 biggest buffers stacked together well.<br>
<br>
2. Similar to shaman, we need to get a torpor type of spells, I mean a shorter duration with larger amount healing over time. I would like to get side effects like torpor so as to limit this use for a tank, but it is still very useful to heal caster.<br>
<br>
3. Some New illusion forms that make druid have a different look with improved abilities should be good. New forms should be used in indoor (not a wolfform as it has sow effect), can cast on others so it will be benefit to groups/whole parties.<br>
<br>
Have to stop here, time to goto work.<br>
