Because if someone asks me come here and sign up to this list of improvements that druids needs so will I read through the list and make a decision if I think druids do need them or not. Same way I would expect you read through a list saying (faked up) saying, come here and sign up if you agree.<br>
<br>
Clerics need:<br>
5k dot against anything going over 1 min costing 200m<br>
10k heal for 200m casting time 1sec with instant recast<br>
Ports to every zone in game<br>
Unresistable snare even on unsnarable mobs<br>
<br>
Now, I dont think you would agree to the above and nor would I and the list is extreme. But that is my point, I dont agree with the list posted, I dont think druids need that kind of upgrades. I do think druids do need upgrades but not the list posted. So that leaves me three choices:<br>
<br>
1. Sign up for something I dont belive in<br>
2. Dont sign up and leave<br>
3. Argue against the current list and point and say look here, this is a upgrade I think you need instead<br>
<br>
Now, I state my oppinion on issues if I think I got something to add of value. Something most druids here has done is as fast as someone say I dont agree so is they flamed saying yes we do. The reply is, you crying snibbeling dr00ds go solo Wyverns again and the &quot;debate&quot; goes down to kindergarten. And that is the second thing, you (as community and class) cant even agree on what you want in upgrades. Some talk about 55+, some talk about high end raiding talking without saying what they mean, some talk about burrower ring, some talk about over all balance from level 30. All those got different things that needs to be weighted in when you approach with a manifest saying we need the following changes.<br>
<br>
Also any form of direct heal will affect clerics (and no, we are not the most wanted class outside raids, a shaman can replace a cleric anywhere except CT and second floor Ssra if they run into a elite with slow. A druid cant replace a cleric as easy as a shaman but they do replace a cleric rather easy in 80% of the zones) when it come to doing something outside of the raid. The raid is our bread and butter due to CH but that is also all we do bring (1 cleric for Aego every 2.5h assuming they did not get AA buff skill). Outside a raid so is CH something you need to cast on the tank every 4+ mobs if even that (fear break in with 1 group, I casted 1 divine light during the first 30 min and that was all my healing on a full spawn fear. Ssra? I can go afk and they live when I come back 10 min later). So why am I here? Because either so are all classes excluding most of the druids posting completly insane and druids are severly crippled and can barly do anything or so are druids now reaching the end game and suddently cant dot/heal the MT etc as they thought they should. They are looking for a role in highlevel raids but cant fit in one roll easy and directly see wow, this was great difference. Most druids say we aint needed, well not needed as in the raid wont happend if you aint there but you are damn handy to have around! Lack wizards? Let the druids nuke. Lack healing power? Let the druid help healing. Mage lom doing rods? Let the druid do the ds. So there is not one given role in a high level raid for a druid but it do what it always have done, it fills in what ever gaps there is. Does that mean a druid can be replaced? Yup. That is a price payed by beeing able to take on several different roles in the highend game but not beeing master on any of them.<br>
<br>
For the one talking about cleric dots, we got a 750 undead only dot for 275m working over 5 or 6 ticks (it is fast but cant recall how fast). It got ~same dmg/mana as our undead dd (725dd undead only in example with instant recast).<br>

Ok, and you have any grounds to judge what upgrades Druids need at the high level game based on what experience?<br>

<br>
The initial petition complains that druids are no longer viable healers in high level situations, while Clerics and Shamen remain capable of healing under those circumstances (among other things, but that one issue seems to be what ninety percent of the discussion is revolving around).<br>
<br>
Perhaps the problem is not in the druid, but in the perception of his place in the raid.<br>
<br>
There are only three classes in the game who never change their focus throughout their entire game life.  Warriors start the game hitting small things with large weapons, and never stop until level 60, although the things they hit get meaner and the large weapons get larger.  Clerics begin the game healing the wounds caused by the random creatures that one sees throughout Norrath and Luclin, and by the end of their levels, they are still healing, although they are considerably better at it.  Wizards start out with the ability to do damage to anything that looks like it might be dangerous, and although they do broaden their focus a bit over time, by 60 they still are essentially large artillary pieces, doing extreme amounts of damage until they are out of mana, then essentially helpless, since their largest function has been exhausted.<br>
<br>
And then we come to every other class in the game (except perhaps the Beastlords, since the discussion is still out as to what the extent of their function is at all levels).  Necromancers start the game as Lifetappers, their vaunted pets of only minimal use until level 4 (or 8 depending on which Necro you talk to).  They eventually broaden their horizons to become a major pet class, a class that can Heal, use Dots, limited DD (very limited), and develop into a more group friendly class as time goes on, until their original purpose has very little resemblance to final product.  Rogues and Monks start their careers as second class Warriors, developing eventually into the highest damage output 'tank' class in the game, within rigid parameters (they cannot take damage and require a Taunting class to take damage for them).  The Shamen start the game as much tanks as casters, due to the armour they can wear, developing first into a Healer and DOT class, losing Healing power in relation to the dedicated Healing class of the Cleric, but soon gaining a pet, and never losing the title of the Buffing Class of Everquest.  And so we continue through every class in the game.<br>
<br>
What then of the druids?  If you hold that they are not a viable healing class after 55, is it possible that they are not intended to be?  Many have disagreed, citing that the druids are still a very capable healing class clear up to 60 in all situations, while others (one can discount Aidon, since he is so busy running into trees that it has not occurred to him yet that there might be a forest) believe that is not true.  Could this be because druids are intended to have another function after 55 that is not so based on their ability (or lack of ability) to heal?  Or perhaps this new role is not fully workable, and some provision should be made to enhance it after 55, perhaps at the cost of any Healing spells after that level (balance must be maintained).<br>
<br>
I do realize that the primary argument is that balance is not currently maintained, although the 'gimme list' is somewhat laughable, containing as it does enhanced versions of existing specialist spells in almost every area of the game (missing only demands for Lures, Resses and Complete Heal, and some of the advocates of the gimme list have demanded those too).<br>
<br>
There are probably three primary alternatives.<br>
<br>
First, the list can be modified back to a realistic point.  A self only version of Protection of the Grove is quite viable and very reasonable, since the Clerics do indeed have a precedent with their self only Buff line.  Stacking issues can likewise be examined, perhaps finding a way to stack symbols, high level Cleric buffs or general high level buffs with the high level druid buffs (or at least a compromise, as has been made with other stacking issues, where some aspects stack and others are over written).  Beyond that, Cold and Fire based versions of Winged Death, with identical mana cost and damage?  A cold based equivalent to Ro's Smouldering Disjunction?  I would hesitate to add either of those, although they would certainly be worth examining for suitability and balance.<br>
<br>
A second possibility would involve a major reworking of the class, but would be viable.  Remove the 10 percent penalty for Healing, and even add five percent to that, at the cost of all Snare spells.  Give Complete Heal to the druid class, at the cost of all DD and DOT spells.  Give better hit point and AC buffs, at the cost of Port and movement spells, then to balance it, add lower grade DD spells, enhanced against the undead.  Many posts in this discussion have agreed that makes a balanced class, and it would certainly give the healing abilities the original post desired.<br>
<br>
A third possibility involves looking at the class as a whole, instead of only a portion of it.  It takes as long to get from 50 to 60 as it does from 1 to 50, so we can consider this petition to be involving only a quarter of the life of the character (assuming 55 to 60 being half of the road from 50 to 60, which it is not, but we need some sort of rough benchmark).  The druid class is held to be very powerful from 1 to 55, not only in its ability to solo (the argument of many here), but also in its ability to do virtually everything, even if it is not done as well as the class with a distinctive in the ability.  Should a limitation on 55 to 60 be considered a reasonable price to pay for excess power from 1 to 55? (whether there is indeed excess power at those levels is a point for another post, since the originators of this petition have insisted those levels not be considered)<br>
<br>
The bottom line though, is that in spite of the insistance that the levels from 1 to 55 not be considered for the purpose of this discussion, the gimme list attempts to define the role of the druid from 55 to 60 as being the same role the druid has played from 1 to 55, and I would not be so fast to assume that, since so few other classes keep the same role throughout their entire life.<br>
<br>
And the standard replies to the trolls who attempt to reply to any argument they do not agree with.  I do play in the high level game as both caster and tank, but do not play a druid myself.  I group with druids, my guild employs them in the high level game, I have grouped with them both before and after 55.  I have found many druids that I regularly hunt with have little problem finding groups, because from 1 to 55 they created reputations for themselves as good group members, and I have seen druids haunting zone borders shouting for groups who do not get them, because they soloed from 1 to 55, and nobody in the high end game has every heard of them.<br>

This isn't OUR perception nearly so much as how other people perceive us.<br>
<br>
I would much rather be a secondary nuker/DoTer on a raid, but guess what? We're placed in groups to heal them.  We are priests, we heal.  That's what we are expected to do, that is what we need to do better.  <br>
<br>
Of all of my abilities, healing is my least efficient, yet that is the one I'm called upon to use far far far more than any other.   <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>
