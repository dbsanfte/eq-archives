<br>
&quot;&quot;Equality&quot; in PvP or any game with HvH is a myth.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;To me, Player vs Player has always been about equality. Meaning playing on a level playing field, where each player plays by the same rules.&quot; <br>
<br>
I did not even remotely hint that players are equal in ability in PvP. So no need to even imply that i did so. <br>
<br>
&quot;The &quot;level playing field&quot; is a myth as well.&quot; <br>
<br>
As you admit later, it is not a myth in the context i meant it to be. The rules are same for either player in player-vs-player combat (in my opinion) even if the skill of the players is vastly different. If one player uses different rules and has different goals then the &quot;equality&quot; the phrase PvP implies is not there. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Its my opinion that D&amp;D was not &quot;based&quot; on PvP in any way, shape, or form.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you must have been playing with yourself....:)&quot;<br>
<br>
No, im just playing the game how it was meant to be played along with others who understood the basic fundamentals of RPing. <br>
<br>
&quot;BTW, being governed by the same set of game rules does not necessarily mean being treated the same under those rules.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, but thats really not relevant to my line of reasoning. Seems a weak excuse in an attempt to justify a weak position. <br>
<br>
D&amp;D is based on Player vs Environment. This environment is created and administered by a DM with a goal of providing entertainment to the Players (and thus indirectly obtaining entertainment for himself). <br>
<br>
In many instances a DM controls NPCs (&lt;--NON PLAYER characters, meaning they are NOT players but rather part of the environment). By this very definition, created by the makers of D&amp;D, this is NOT Player vs Player combat. If any thing, its Player vs Non Player combat.  <br>

So?  Are you claiming some sort of disparate treatment by the game server?  Or the hardware perhaps?   Maybe the routers have a little conspiracy going on ... "ah, there's Scirocco's 'fire' packet, why don't I just uhh delay that a bit".  :)<br>

Meddik says:  <b><i>However, on the other hand, there are those such as myself that really have absolutely no interest in PvP. We will not be happy if we are forced into PvP, or if we will miss large portions of the PvE game by avoiding PvP.</b></i><br>
<br>
But PvP has both direct AND indirect consequences, and you, as the non-PvP player, benefit from the indirect consequences even though you do not engage in PvP.  A PvP environment can promote a stronger sense of community and self-government, encourage roleplaying, and increase customer retention -- aspects of the game that will affect you even if you are never engaged in combat with another player.<br>
<br>
No MMRPG can be complete without PvP, no matter how you look at it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/10/01 10:24:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ah!</span><hr size=1> Badaf, you're still missing the point.

<br>
So you're responsible for that?!  Ah-ha!<br>
<br>
BTW, no, that's not particularly what I meant.  I was speaking more generally (and tangentially, unfortunately for this thread) about the issue of &quot;equality.&quot;   Everyone participating in a game should be governed by the rules of the game, correct?   My point is that the rules of a game don't have to treat all participants the same.<br>
<br>
Of course, many games do strive to do so, especially where the game is designed around head-to-head conflict resulting in a winner and a loser.  I suspect that many people think that that is what PvP in a RPG is all about.  It can be, but it doesn't have to be.  But it's understandable, especially if one's only exposure to PvP is in the context of Quake or UO.  <br>

The problem (as I see it anyway) is that the term PvP which you initially used has too many preconceived and bad connotations to many people.<br>
<br>
For the majority of people when you used the term PvP it is equated in their minds (or it seems so to me) with a PKer. The two things in a roleplaying aspect are quite different, but appear to be equated for most people.<br>
<br>
This gives you a huge uphill battle in the point you are trying to make. Not only are you trying to demonstrate your point, but you also have to get your target audience to change the perceptions that they have with regards to certain terms.<br>
<br>
As a lawyer Scirocco you know quite well the kind of effect that what words you actually use can have on your target audience. You have said it before Scirocco, how you say something to your target audience is as important or more important that the message itself.<br>
<br>
In this case I'd say that using PvP was a poor choice of terminology. I realize that you have later attempted to change that, but still, the impression has been made in the original post.<br>
<br>
All that being said (I'm a wordy child born out of wedlock sometimes...), I agree with you. Having a human on the other side of an encounter is more interesting than facing off against a set AI encounter.<br>
<br>
I have been a DM/GM for over 20 years. A GM (or at least in my opinion) has to vary the stance that he takes throughout a game session. Going from being 'The Friend' to 'The Opportunist' to 'The Enemy'.<br>
<br>
A good encounter should be unpredicatable in nature. It should be more in the nature of, 'Is this character working for us or against us in this situation? Even if he is now... can we depend on him if the situation should change?' The fact that an NPC_Mercenary_01 has worked for you in the past shouldn't leave a group with the feeling that... 'Oh, he's here to help us with this encounter because we hired him out 3 weeks ago. Or he'll help us because he is a guard.' Is the mob/npc honest, dishonest, altering his behavior because his superiors are around, not around, etc.<br>
<br>
Having a mob/NPC that blindly charges the group and then flees when at 15% health doesn't do much to get the blood going for most folks. Having an encounter where the big bad guy takes a hit and runs off to grab underlings to send into the fray first to weaken you and then comes at you, tends to make for a more interesting encounter for most folks.<br>
<br>
And for what it's worth. D&amp;D came from the game Chainmail which was a wargame where sides could have hundreds of troops on a side. The different groups of troops tended to be led by heroes of surpassing skill. It was definately PvP. <p>Arlis

<br>
I take Player versus Player more literally. Meaning a player pitting his skills against another player on a level playing field in an attempt to win by beating the other player as defined by the rules of the game and/or environment.<br>
<br>
David vs Goliath<br>
Packers vs the Rams. <br>
Ali vs Frasier<br>
etc... <br>
<br>
This is how the term PvP was first presented to me and still continues to be defined by the general public today. Your definition of PvP is not the norm and does not carry much weight as far as i see it. <br>
<br>
Therefore, by the way i choose to define what Player vs Player means and how i choose to view the DM/Player relationship in PnP RPGs, they are totally different things. You can continue to argue all you want, but you are not going to change the way i choose to define these things (which is the general public's definition as well). <br>

Not really.  Just trying to help them pierce through all the baggage attached to the term &quot;PvP&quot; to see what truly underlies it.  And why people find it objectionable.   Which is HvH.   Which is also the core of P&amp;P RPGs, where it is usually not objectionable.<br>
<br>
And then, after making the realization that HvH doesn't have to be bad (and, in fact, is often essential to a good story or game), coming back to think anew about how HvH can be incorporated into MMORPGs in a good way.<br>

If you have a strong adverse reaction to &quot;PvP&quot; in MMORPGs, ask yourself why.  And why don't you have the same reaction to PvE?<br>
<br>
Assume that the consequences are the same.  Both can kill you.  Both can cause XP loss (or not).  Both can cause equipment loss (or not).  Would that change your answer, or would you still find PvP objectionable?  <br>
<br>
If so, then the only difference at that point is the human behind your adversary.  HvH.<br>

<br>
The basic problem is that as the size of any community increases linearly, the apparent number of grief players increases exponentially.<br>
<br>
I am MUCH more likely to run into exploiters, griefers, jerks, and people just out for the experience of ruining my playtime as the size of a community grows.<br>
<br>
In a Pen and paper campaign, it is Very very rare that you find someone whose main goal is to ruin the fun for others. But as a community gets larger, it happens more and more.<br>
<br>
Plus, on a MMORPG, the rules (or code) ends up getting incredibly complex. There will be exploitable bugs, loopholes, and unintended weaknesses that other players will use to ruin the game play of others.<br>
<br>
I know, that PvP is not the only way that someone else can affect me in a game. However, it is commonly one of the first methods any grief player will take, assuming that it is available. Why? Because its the simplest route to ruin someone else's gameplay. <p><center><B>Meddik,</B> Rebel Doctor

<br>
Once again, i strongly disagree that HvH is the core of PnP RPGs in the context of players and DMs. If a DM was truely &quot;vs&quot; the players, the players would never win. The &quot;core&quot; can not be so narrowly defined to only look to the player vs npc combat, in my opinion. <br>
<br>
&quot;And then, after making the realization that HvH doesn't have to be bad (and, in fact, is often essential to a good story or game), coming back to think anew about how HvH can be incorporated into MMORPGs in a good way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Its not essential to a good story or game. How can i, as a D&amp;D DM, have created enjoyable adventures where there was no player vs DM-controlled characters? <br>
<br>
&quot;If you have a strong adverse reaction to &quot;PvP&quot; in MMORPGs, ask yourself why. And why don't you have the same reaction to PvE?&quot; <br>
<br>
Now THIS is something i can sink my teeth into. <br>
<br>
Game mechanics are a big part of it to me. RPGs, to me, are about character development which usually revolves around character attributes and improvement. These define the character's abilities as he/she interacts with the environment. In a PvP MMOL atmosphere, many of these elements are tossed right out the window. A character's dexterity and agility are, for all intensive purposes, deleted and replaced by the human player's dexterity and agility. In combat, a character's intelligence and wisdom means nothing since that dim witted orge is going to enter combat with all the facilites of a harden Q2 veteran with a blazing connection speed to match. Yea, thats SO immersive. How can someone not have fun roleplaying in that climate? Forget it. <br>
<br>
Have you ever seen melee characters fight each other in a MMOL environment like EQ? Its really quite a sad sight to me. It boils down to having little to do with the character's abilities, mainly relying in the person controlling the characters reaction speed and hand-eye-coordination. Not to mention that if your connection is better than the other guys, your character is better at PvP combat. Yet another example of how game mechanics in the MMOL genre dismiss character development out of hand. <br>
<br>
Another area that causes me pause in PvP MMOLRPG is accountability for ones actions. Im sure someone will come back with the old &quot;well gather up a bunch of people and go get vengence!&quot;. Frankly, i dont buy that. The environment should react to out-of-alignment actions like in a PnP RPG. This is one area i think MMOLRPGs can improve on however. I think Horizons, for example, is finally taking this seriously. I won't go into the mechanics of what they are implimenting here. I have a feeling you know a bit about it already Scirocco since HZ seems to be the first game that might actually get PvP &quot;right&quot; to a large extent. <br>

Personally, i have never been one to tag PvP in a MMOL setting as something to be avoided. I will be the first to shout that it has not been done even remotely close to my satisfaction....yet. Some day a game might come along that give me the right combination of PvP and Roleplaying that i will find extremely enjoyable. I wont be so jaded as to dismiss it out of hand. But i think that time is still aways off. While player and environment differences that exist outside the game still are there and have such a major impact, i dont see how i will be truely satisfied with a PvP MMOLRPG. It simply takes the character out of the equation which is something i feel is vital to an RPG. <br>

Simple.  You didn't.<br>
<br>
You're fooling yourself if you don't think that there were DM-controlled characters in your games.   I'm assuming you had the usual run of NPCs and monsters for the PCs to fight.<br>
<br>
So tell me, what did the players fight, if not NPCs or monsters?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>FAQ/Index Moderator</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/11/01 1:03:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Um</span><hr size=1> I don't disagree with a lot of the substantive comments being made here about why PvP (HvH) doesn't work very well in MMORPGs, BTW.  <br>
<br>
Size of the player pool.<br>
No screening for the player population.<br>
No accountability.<br>
Lack of serious consequences.  (A PKer getting killed by the APKers is NOT a serious consequence when the PKer is back in action in an hour or two.  Six months or so would be a different story.)<br>

<br>
They didnt fight. While im a bit insulted by your narrow-mindedness by saying i didn't do something that i did, i will provide examples where combat didnt take place.  <br>
<br>
Module 1. <br>
<br>
Players were placed in a highly political situation. Combat was not an option. They had to use political influence, land bargaining, trade concessions, and negotiation skills to quell a potential war. <br>
<br>
Module 2. <br>
<br>
Players went through a dungeon with NO creatures at all. Only puzzle-solving and trap avoidance were needed to succeed. <br>
<br>
Module 3. <br>
<br>
Attacking any creature in this module would result in triple exp lose equivalent to what exps they would have gained killing it. All creatures were under protection of a deity who controlled this realm. While, technically, this could have involved some combat, the players managed to complete the module without a single confrontation. <br>
<br>
Module 4. <br>
<br>
Players were given a mission to infiltrate a heavily guarded castle and steal a critical quest item. Due to the ability of the castle's clerics and mages, any combat would eventually lead to their capture and had to be avoided at all cost in order to succeed. <br>
<br>
Module 5. <br>
<br>
Players found themselves imprisoned deep in enemy territory. The enemies were very powerful and could easily destroy the party. Players had to escape undetected. <br>
<br>
All these examples are modules i created. Me and the players involved had a very enjoyable time in each one of them. So please do not insult me by telling me i didn't do it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Unfortunately, I think that MMORPGs do this already. You can't really call EQ a true RPG, can you? Even the proposed &quot;RPing&quot; server won't do the job....&quot;<br>
<br>
Depends on how you take it. Me and my guild RP 100% of the time in EQ. If its not a &quot;true&quot; RPG then i dont know what is. I will say the environment in EQ is not very conducive to roleplaying. The only reward we get for roleplaying is self-satisfaction and acknowledgement from ourselves and other RPers. But that doesn't stop us. We have never been one to back down from a challenge. <br>

In anycase, the majority of people dont want to stealth through things without some sort of confrontations, and after repetetion it would get boring and linear if it was all stealth or non-confrontational.  I'm trying to stay away from generalizing as much as possible, but i also want to be as realistic as possible.  Imo, most people dont prefer to do just trade skills, dancing in AO, or other things some roleplayers consider enjoyable.  There really is no excitement or thrill in that because there is no danger.  Danger is what makes somebody sit at the edge of their seat with their adrenaline pumping.  I dont think i'll ever have my adrenaline pump in EQ again, because i've become so used to the typical actions of the AI.  <br>
<br>
Of course not everybody plays games for the same reasons and this difference in play styles is why people need to be separated.  Also the envy/jealousy factor, because most games are based on fighting to advance or to survive.  Roleplayers that would rather do skills end up being beat up on(as in UO), or arent able to advance as fast(as in EQ) without confrontations.  They end up having a problem with the way the game mechanics allow others that choose to fight to become stronger faster than they do.  So they wait and wait in hopes for a MMORPG to come out that caters to the non-confrontational play style or at least puts that on an even keel with those that choose to fight.   I can remember some people posting about the ability AO was going to have to allow them to lvl without having to fight.  And AO has this feature, but a person choosing this method of play will never have the equality they want with those that choose to fight.  Imo fighitng is the basis of games, or at least mass marketed games.  A game that catered to the non-confrontational play-style would be catering to a very specialized and smaller audience.  Not to be demeaning but a game without confrontation is not much of a game imo.    <br>
<br>
I dont think D&amp;D was true PvP, since the DM often wasnt trying to beat the players, but rather make it challenging and an enjoyable experience.  People dont like to die or lose anything they own, which is another problem that PvP games have to account for, as well as the DM in regards to D&amp;D(So the DM is forced to 'dummy' himself abit).  There will always be players that arent better, or more powerful than others, and will end up being victimized in PvP.  Many times these players dont want to adapt and want the system changed to protect them, and thats what usually occurs.  There is NEVER an even playing field in PvP MMORPG's mostly due to connection and computer.  Then you have the resources available for one player that might not be there for another, or the skill in combat of one player(who is very into PvP) as opposed to the casual PvP.  So some people will always make excuses and always want change to protect and cater to them.  This will never change.<br>
<br>
The bottom line here is that i agree that IF a MMORPG were able to incorporate a free PvP environment with little to no AI or artificial mechanics, but the free will of players to enact justice and keep the world relatively chaos free, then that would be the pinnacle a MMORPG can reach.  Storylines and community would happen naturally, in the same way when you put 6 people together in a house(as in the REAL WORLD), and then it gets interesting, then televised ).  Communities battling other communities over ideals or some soap opera'sh falling out is what gets people 'into' the game.  Would you rather read a book or experience the book?  Would you rather somebody make up a fictional storyline or a storyline that naturally formed on its own?  But like i said, some people would rather 'read' the book, or prefer the madeup 'fictional' storyline, just like some people prefer AI for a gaming experience.  <br>
<br>
Btw, i wanted to stay away from the premise of the argument about 'RPG', since it seems to be defined differently for many people.  And i dont believe D&amp;D was the pinnacle a game can reach, nor do i believe trying to reach the extreme definition of what 'RPG' stands for equates to 'fun'.  Imo, the bottom line of a game is fun.  Actually, i think a pure 'RPG' game(or a hardcore roleplayers idea of a game) would be quite boring to alot of people.  In AO, there is a 'bug' with NPC vendors that only allows only one person to be able to see the menu and buy at a time, so a line is formed(of which people dont honor and leads to all kinds of arguments and name calling but thats beside the point).  There are roleplayers that prefer this because they believe its realistic and more conduscive to roleplaying.  Imagine that, from my perspective its just a big hassle and downtime.  From a roleplayers perspective it allows them to emote me and show off their roleplay skills.  /shrug<br>
<br>
Splitting up the play styles is the best chance a game has to making everybody happy.  I dont want a game based on roleplaying, i want a game thats fun.  My favorite games are the ones that allow for player development and customization(roleplaying elements) as well as excitement and danger(PvP).  Obviously some feel differently.  How are we supposed to both be happy within the same game structure?  Especially in a free PvP environment?  Keep in mind the expectations of equality.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=badaf>Badaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/12/01 6:45:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .....</span><hr size=1> Broomhilda:<br>

<br>
Some of them were, but some were not. <br>
<br>
But anyways, perhaps the majority of people you know don't want to stealth through things, but i bet the majority of Thief fans would completely disagree with you. And also i would like to point out that stealth-type adventures tend to be much more non-linear than most all combat-oriented adventures. Believe it or not, many gamers find combat-oriented games to be boring and actively seek games that steer away from it. To many, the excitement of trying not to get caught is much more of a rush than the excitement of combat. I even think that echoes through into real life as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
Oh really? Then please explain why the 2 best selling computer games of all time (and by a huge margin), Myst and The Sims, are non-confrontational? The Sims does have some confrontation in it, but that can hardly be classified as a feature of the game. Throw in another incredibly successful game, Tetris, and tell me these 3 are &quot;catering to a very specialized and smaller audience&quot;. Perhaps your view of games is not as prevelent in the gaming community as you think. <br>
<br>
&quot;My favorite games are the ones that allow for player development and customization(roleplaying elements) as well as excitement and danger(PvP). Obviously some feel differently.&quot;<br>
<br>
Danger can be had without player vs player combat. And most certainly excitement can.<br>
<br>

<br>
Depends. If i want to be the &quot;hero&quot; of a book but am continuouly cast in the role of fodder for the powergamers, i dont want to experience it. <br>
<br>
I hope that a game comes out that fits your definition of &quot;pinnacle MMORPG&quot;. I dont think it will be as fun to you as you imagine however, due to the player base that will permeate it. Past PvP MMOL games show us that very very few of the players tend to &quot;enact justice and keep the world relatively chaos free.&quot; Therefore allowing chaos to reign supreme which leads to a frustrating, grief-ridden experience for many players.  <br>

HvH does NOT require physical combat.  Human conflict takes many forms.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Module 1. Players were placed in a highly political situation. Combat was not an option. They had to use political influence, land bargaining, trade concessions, and negotiation skills to quell a potential war. <br>
<br>
And who did they use that political influence on, who did they bargain with, who did they negotiate with?  If with you playing the role of the other side through NPCs, then it was HvH.  If the players were taking opposing sides amongst themselves, it was even more obviously HvH. <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Module 2. Players went through a dungeon with NO creatures at all. Only puzzle-solving and trap avoidance were needed to succeed. <br>
<br>
See previous posts for comments on GMs or DMs taking an adversarial role through the environment.  As I said above, PvE in a P&amp;P RPG is usually still HvH.  <br>
<br>
You as the GM needed to be there to determine if the puzzle was solved or the traps sprung or avoided, right?  If you were absent, could the players still have done the module?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Module 3. Attacking any creature in this module would result in triple exp lose equivalent to what exps they would have gained killing it. All creatures were under protection of a deity who controlled this realm. While, technically, this could have involved some combat, the players managed to complete the module without a single confrontation. <br>
<br>
Who controlled the creatures they were avoiding?  You did, I assume.  HvH.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Module 4.  Players were given a mission to infiltrate a heavily guarded castle and steal a critical quest item. Due to the ability of the castle's clerics and mages, any combat would eventually lead to their capture and had to be avoided at all cost in order to succeed. <br>
<br>
Who controlled the clerics and mages they were avoiding?  You did, I assume.  And who would have controlled those clerics and mages if combat was not avoided?  You did, I assume.  HvH.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Module 5. Players found themselves imprisoned deep in enemy territory. The enemies were very powerful and could easily destroy the party. Players had to escape undetected. <br>
<br>
Who controlled the enemies they were avoiding?  You did, I assume.  HvH.<br>
<br>
I suspected that you might come back with some examples like these.  That's why I said you were fooling yourself.  It wasn't meant as a personal insult.<br>
