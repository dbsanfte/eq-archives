My problem is with Verant's apparent knee-jerk reaction to call the development of this new strategy an exploit (or near exploit). The mentality this reaction betrays should be obvious to any experienced player of this game (even those who thought I was being a bit extreme with my VerantSpeak are seeing the light).<br>

Do I want Verant to think and act this way?  Absolutely not.

what SHOULD an enchanter be doing on these encounters?<br>
<br>
nothing but a C2 / Shissar dispenser?<br>
<br>
geez... as if the threat of having charm break and having a 32k hp mob with YOU as the only entry on its hatelist was not enough to balance charm, on mobs where they have disabled mez and stun... now they remove charm entirely.<br>
<br>
verant wont be happy until the remove al classes but Cleric and Wariors from the game.  everyone else is just exploiters waiting to get caught.<br>
<br>
charm is only used in situations where the pet can be main tank.  hell, even the lame pickup groups i am sometimes stuck in know enough to stop taunting when i charm soemthing.  let the expendable tank take the hits, thats the reason you charmed them in the first place. <p>Azeroeth</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usaliciaswiftfoot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salicia Swiftfoot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/7/01 2:14:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.theglobe.com/FEBertoxx/SALSTAMP.JPG HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=100 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kael Nerf</span><hr size=1> Well Azeroth, you are talking to a druid, so don't whine about chanters not having much to do on raids. :p<br>
<br>
<br>
In all seriousness though, enchanters are doing what they're supposed to be doing.  Charm the giants and send them in.  Unfortunately, thanks to the goofy pet agro bug, the Giants end up doing the tanking.  Once the pet agro bug is fixed, using charmed pets to help fight will be a valid (non-exploit) tactic.  The AOW won't concentrate on the pets 99% of the time and the tactic won't be "heal the pets for their 32k hp tank health"<br>
<br>
<br>
The tactic of charming pets to help fight is a good tactic.  The tactic of charming a giant to be your main tank with 32k hp that can be Chealed easilly, is an exploit (although I doubt the guilds realized that and that's why VI isn't busting their chops, especially considering how badly VI flubbed the whole conquest ordeal)  The only problem is, like I said above, is that VI will fix the bug, but won't turn on charm again (they'll put it on their to-do list, we know how that is).<br>
<br>
<br>
Disagree with me all you want, I don't side with VI often, but I see VI's point in this.  If your whole tactic of bringing down a supermonster relies on a tanking charmed pet as your main tank, then something is wrong and needs to be fixed. <p><p><a href="http://www.eqdivine.net"><img src="http://members.theglobe.com/FEBertoxx/DRAGONRARA.GIF" width="311" height="184"></a></p>

I don't think it's an exploit either, and Verant made a mistake saying that.  However, I can fully understand why, if the pet aggro coding is such that nothing else can get to the top of the hatelist, they don't want that to be used in certain encounters.<br>

<br>
Yes, they did... very briefly.  I suspect there is more to this story then simply an enchanter or two charming a giant for a pet.  An enchanter in a safe spot, charming a 32k hp giant as a pet then taking advantage of the pet aggro issue is definately an exploit and I suspect that is closer to the situation at hand rather then just an enchanter or two chain charming a giant that would wipe the floor with both enchanters in 2 seconds the minute charm broke!!<br>
<br>
I tend to agree with Salicia in this one.  Verant just needs to fix the pet aggro issue then all will be fine.  The problem is how long will that take and what will they break in the process!!<br>
<br>
There is really a track record of when Verant will cry exploit and it is actually pretty consistant.  When a group or groups find a tactic that is reasonably successful and causes minimal risk to the group, you almost always see Verant discussing exploit.  In one form or another, that appears to be what happened here.  They dont have enough evidence to do a full fledged reprimand, but they do have enough evidence to suspect what was happening and took steps to prevent the tactic from being used. <p><table border="0">

Stuff in bold is the stuff I added.  Note, I'm stating my understanding of Verant's position and they are not necessarily reflective of my own views.<br>

In regards to safe spots for enchanters and charm, the charmed giants were taking damage, and thus would summon the enchanter as soon as charm broke, safe spot or no.<br>

 Having a monster be a main tank for an entire raid with 60  people who aren't getting hit because the pet aggro is skewed very badly is bad<br>
 Note the distinction...<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks for clarifying &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; for us, I'm sure we're all relieved to have had this distinction made.<br>
<br>
Regarding this quote, I assume you are referring to the famed AoW fight? Surely you saw the screenshots, it was hardly the case that &quot;people aren't getting hit&quot; with that many corpses lying around. They got hit plenty, which implies to me that the pet mega-i-can't-be-out-taunted-no-matter-what-because-pet-taunt-is-skewed-&quot;very badly&quot; bug is not nearly as close to an impenetrable exploit as some would have us believe.  <br>
<br>
Here is the bottom line as I see it. They didn't want the AoW killed, at least not yet or without a force of 100 . So, this encounter was &quot;trivialized&quot;. Note that does not say &quot;trivial&quot;, it says &quot;trivialized&quot;. It's like if I tell you something has been &quot;weakened&quot;. That does not necessarily mean that it is &quot;weak&quot;.<br>
<br>
In their minds, the encounter was trivialized because somebody did it, and didn't have to mass the whole server to do so.<br>
<br>
I gotta figure they don't want the AoW killed. If they do......the true irony here is that they know so little about their own game that they don't realize that to get the force together to kill this guy would crash the zone.<br>
<br>
Once again, they introduce bug, then they even claim it is fixed, then they realize that it isn't fixed, then rather than fix it they get pissed off because somebody uses that bug to their advantage and call foul because it is &quot;unfair&quot; to all the rest of us dogooders who are so saintly that we don't &quot;do&quot; exploits. <br>
<br>
I really loved the part where they said that everyone knew the bug still existed in part. That was rich. Like everyone knew, but only this naughty 60 people across all the servers tried to use it.  Maybe the rest of us were stupid enough to believe that they had in fact FIXED the bug when they said they did.  <br>

<br>
With the damage output that the AOW does, I'm sure plenty of charmed Giants fell right along with the other players that the AOW would plow through.  When you're dependant on 45 second charms which CAN be resisted, as well as dealing with the Chaos of 8 enchanters trying to chain charm a monster with a spell that has a 5 minute refresh, you can surely bet that other people will be hit and killed while the enchanters try to keep their pet in check.  <br>
<br>
The point is, once the Giant Pet was charmed and fighting the AOW, the AOW stuck to the Giant like a fly to sugar, even in the screenshots you can see the clerics shouting "complete heal to GiantSoandso!" <br>
<br>

No argument here, I really do think that the VI monster designers are smoking crack when they come up with some of these "uber" stats.<br>

<br>
Not a mass server attempt, just something in the range of 100 people I'd imagine.  AOW was done with around 60 people and a few uber giants that were main tanking.<br>

I really loved the part where they said that everyone knew the bug still existed in part. That was rich. Like everyone knew, but only this naughty 60 people across all the servers tried to use it. Maybe the rest of us were stupid enough to believe that they had in fact FIXED the bug when they said they did. </I><br>
<br>
Don't hang out with many magicians, do you?  Several Magicians in my guild have been complaining like crazy, and they crack jokes at the fact that their super Jabobar has been able to consistently outtaunt our Main Assist 60 Warrior swinging uber weapons.  Either way, claiming ignorance does not allow you immunity to cheating (even if it is unintentional). Even though VI does act stupid in situations like this, as said above, VI is handling this situation very well, by not punishing the people who dropped the AOW using charmed giants as main tanks, but instead disabled the charmed Giants until a fix can be made to their agro code.<br>
<br>
BTW, seeing Absor's latest posts on the dev board, he's saying that charm will be put back in once the pet agro is fixed.  Once the pet agro is fixed, people will once again be able to attempt the AOW with charmed Giants.  Lets see what happens then.<br>
