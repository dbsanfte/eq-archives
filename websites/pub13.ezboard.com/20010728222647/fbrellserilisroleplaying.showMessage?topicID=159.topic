From now and then an occasional traveller might spy her sitting about the scenery as he passed, but thought little of it and went about his way. But this hour of this particular day, the young woman was being watched. Keros had always been a curious lad and he was very eager to figure out the young specimen that he had followed this day. Several times, the young man had followed her as she left from her home in Kelethin and journeyed into the wilderness. Cleverly camouflaging himself in the wood, he pulled his binoculars from their case and focused on her penmanship to discover what his interest was writing. Keros' curiosity was also fueled by a greater reason, for his and the girl's parents had arranged their marriage from birth - a situation he would not have chosen himself, but with the desire to please his family he did not object. They could not object, for their marriage would bring together two of the most noble families in all of Kelethin. Thankfully, the girl was quite pretty and Keros could not help being stirred and intrigued at the thought of her. Silently, he began to listen to the sweet sound of her sweet humming and watched closely at what her hand was scribbling upon the parchment.<br>
<br>
&quot;...It is a pleasant day to be free of the troubles of Kelethin! It seems all my parents desire for me is to care for my younger siblings and be most proper, if only they knew of my desires. Tis sometimes a pity that I was not born a son, t'would be better! They would have no wish to keep me from the hunts or to bar me from my weapons training. I thank Tunare everyday that they have allowed me to pursue the bow. I have won several competitions as of late and have established a bit of popularity with those of my years. Some say that I am in the top 50 shooters in all of Faydwer, tis most flattering! Alas, it does not really matter, but it is a nice release from my family duties. *pauses in her writing* Oh mother and father, this Keros is a handsome man, but I do not think he has any interest in me! Why for did you arrange for us to marry? Should we not love each other? I have so many questions, but I know that they are foolish and you shall never answer such things. I am still so young, mother, I have so much to see and to learn, I wish so much to run with the forest creatures and feel the winds whip through the locks of my hair. I want the cool rains to caress my lips and dampen my skin. Oh Mother Tunare, do let me experience the freedom of these things. I... I pray that they shall not worry, for I have decided to leave them... I am old enough, 124 years, hardly a child anymore. Please, Tunare, guide my heart and my arrows and take me from this pla....&quot;<br>
<br>
Suddenly Keros stepped on a dried leaf and revealed himself to his unsuspecting victim. Sheepishly, he gathered himself and smiled at her surprised gaze. The girl stood up quickly and slammed her journal shut, her legs shaking as if she was ready to run off into the Feydark at any moment. Keros gently rested his hand on the girl's petite shoulder and brushed her stray hairs from her face. With softened features he parted his lips and spoke, &quot;Fear not, m'lady, I have watched you often when you have written in your journal. Your thoughts have touched the very core of my heart and melted any coldness that could have possibly been present there. Please, do not go, I ... I love your feelings and I am.... overwhelmed by your presence.&quot; As his whisper ended, the young woman's cheeks blushed crimson. No one had ever said such things to her, nor delighted in what she wished for her life. Smiling, she placed her small fingers gently into his outstretched hand and together they returned to Kelethin. Two years later, it was time for the girl to away from her family. Finally with her parents' blessings she began to pursue the art of the blade, but she never forgot the warmth of the woodland creatures that Tunare had blessed her with. Together with the support of her love, she would soon venture out into a strange new world that she could have never dreamed or imagined.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/uwarith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warith</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lost One </span><br>  Posts: 338<br> <font color=#CC9900>(10/6/00 6:45:26 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/fuga404/qa2.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Tattered Journal</span><hr size=1> Nice story <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The ending needs a bit of work I have the feeling that this is the end of this story and it leaves you hanging as to what happens.<br>
