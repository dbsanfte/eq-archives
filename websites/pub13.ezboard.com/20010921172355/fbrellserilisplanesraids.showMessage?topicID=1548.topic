Meaning a sign up could be:<br>
<br>
Watchers<br>

Mystical fighting ogre/wicked dorfs from the east/random indy01<br>

Aslong as both raid sign up are able to meet the required sign up number.<br>
<br>
Let me answer some of the questions before you ask them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Q. What if our guild can field 18 lvl 53 for VS but we have no Wizards at all?<br>
<br>
A. Well no one are saying that you only have to go slay VS with 18 people. You can bring 6 groups if you want to aslong as the 18 people are of those listed, or from the same guild and does not hold a spot on other rotation lists.<br>
<br>
Q. What if someone use fake names to get more Rotation spots?<br>
<br>
A. In some way this could happen to some extent but there are many honorable people out there that might not want to have something like that over their head and report the activity. <br>
<br>
Further more since no guilds on brell really host anything guild only. All the people that are invited to the raid but wasnt between the signed up names will be the watchdogs.<br>
<br>
Q. What if someone have more character that are high lvl? <br>
<br>
A. Well having more characters that are high lvl would buy you more names you could use to sign up with, this would probably be the hardest one to police if you stated that this wasnt allowed So why not just allow it.<br>
<br>
Q. But that means the Uber guilds will have more names to put on the lists as smallers guilds would.<br>
<br>
A. Isnt this also fair in the sense that this will change as other people get higher lvl?<br>
<br>
Q. I dont think this system is fair cause...ehm..our Current system is so much more fair and I dont mind waiting 50 spots before my guild of 3 people can do VS so why shouldnt i just vote NO for this system?<br>
<br>
A. Cause you as a person like everyone else on the server know that this is better than what already is in place.<br>
<br>
Q. What if someone violate the rules?<br>
<br>
A. All spots on all rotation lists of someone that are violating the rules are moved to the bottom of that current list. The list for the mob which the Violation took place will get a 1 month blocking from this raid team.<br>
<br>
<br>
I read over Aduns system 100 times and I cant find anyway that this system wouldnt be more fair than what we already have.<br>

I remember nillon said he could handle that, but most people would not go for it..  <br>
<br>
I think what happened with Adun's system personally is half the people wanted one thing, the other half wanted something else, and NOONE was willing to find any middle ground.  Some people considered adun's plan a *compromise*, but it was not a compromise, it was a plan to be discussed and from which you could of had some compromise... but no one would do it. Every wanted only what is best for them and screw it if I have to give an inch. (that is both sides of the arguement)<br>

It's a solid idea.<br>
<br>
Course, I also liked Aduns idea of doing a lottery (random) for raids/plane reservations...  You could pretty easily trim every raid/reservation to five (or any number) on deck with a pool/lottery for who's up next.  <br>
<br>
Or combine the two ideas somehow<br>
<br>
However... only thing that is &quot;bad&quot; about raid reform is that it can't happen (I'd guess) till all the existing raids occurred... which is what, ten years on VS now?

I like the way that FFA has been working in Velious.  Plane of Growth sorted itself out nicely without any reservation system being required.<br>
<br>
Because people can't compromise on anything, we won't be able to improve what we have right now.  Because we can't improve what we have now, FFA will soon result in FG's, a little later on VS, and a bit after that on Trak.  I don't think it's that bad a solution.  The sheer amount of content in EQ means that it would take more than 5 &quot;uber&quot; guilds to dominate the server.<br>
<br>
Given the nature of the planes, I don't see that changing anytime soon.

<br>
While I agree with your viewpoint of folks living in (insert permapickupsitonasszone), I don't think the reservation system caused it... although it does help perpetuate it.<br>
<br>
80-85% of the playerbase in EQ has always been very apathetic about risk.  It's why none of the lower dungeons are ever utilized.  It's why more Barbarian Fisherman and Dwarf Guards die in a day than goblins in SolA (allowing for the requisite Dr00d farmer in SolA).  It's why half the server doesn't know whats behind the doors in splitpaw and most the other half only know about it to go after the Ishiva Mal at an obscene level.  It's why the coasts in Oasis, the birdvillage in SouthKaranas, the Lake in LOIO, the Giants in Frontier Mountains, the walls of Overthere and Dreadlands get more mileage per minute than (pick a dungeon) sees in an entire week (nay, month...).<br>
<br>
By the time most players have reached planar (etc) levels, they're well groomed in the sign up for a list, wait till your number is called, then go... it's why gems was even a thought inside of EQ.  I still panic if more than 20 people are in a zone... (&quot;why is it so damn crowded?&quot;)<br>
<br>
There's nothing inherently wrong with the idea of reservations... hell, intuitively the notion that &quot;not everyone&quot; can do certain things at the same time makes sense...<br>
<br>
I do see a lot of validity in the complaints of the reservation system... I also think most of the folks complaining about the system are their own worst enemies (several manage to come across as rabid maniacs... when there's a solid point within the rage).  Dunno what the solution is... but it's interesting watching nonetheless.<br>

<br>
How does this relate to the reservations... what I mean is Chardok and HS are not reservable... Chardok is empty alot. Not sure of HS, but why would the reservation system, make someone not want to go try somewhere new? Sounds more like they are afraid to try, rather than the reservation system *sapping* the ambition out of someone. There are TON of places to hnut besides sebilis and karnors.  I personally love both zones, but hate hunting in them. I avoid them like the plague if I can...  <br>
<br>
The first night of the server crash, (patch day) we had a guild little activity planned for juggs/and or king if he was not camped.. Some guy was claiming the king from the zone, and was asking our guild clerics to join him. He did not even have a group (was looking for one) but was claiming it. Those kinds of things are wrong, sebilis is the one zone with over 10 camps, with amazingly 90% of them being camped from the zone. I would quit this game, if I had to live my play time in only karnors and sebilis. hehe <br>

I agree with second sentence here, <br>
<br>
get out of karnors and sebilis and do not blame the reservation system for keeping you there, I do not see a reason why it should. Go have some fun.<br>

<br>
My group crawls though, and kills what ever is in our way..  If there is someone sitting there butt on one camp spot, we just pass by.  But i just Love how people say they are camping something (but they aren't there) and then yell at us for killing it as we pass by..  We need to make hotkeys.. &quot;oh, I didn't realize anyone was killing that, sorry %T&quot;<br>
<br>
My favorite one the other day was my group in the hole..  6 of us, lvl 40-50.. We were crawling around, just looking around at the zone (first time there)  As we passed the &quot;court yard&quot; (?) area, we were jumped and we killed a couple things.. Some ranger OOC'd &quot;CY is camped&quot; We say &quot;yes we know, just passing though&quot;..  We look around, adn see a single ranger sitting there..  HE said &quot;My group had to evac, they will be back&quot; We said okay.. and medded abit before pushing forward... a few seconds later he said &quot;you guys do realize this is camped and you have to leave&quot; (we were planing on it) we looked around and saw like 6 mobs between us and the castle...  wondering how he thought we were going to get there without killing the mobs in the way...  Well, we headed on past, and kept moving...  I guess his team returned at some point, b/c a few min later we heard: &quot;EVAC!!!!  (CY is Still camped, we will be back shortly)&quot;<br>

You know when I go to sebilis, it is out of sheer enjoyment I do a camp check. I look to see who claimed what, and then I look to see who is at the zone.. then I know where to go /grin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Come back to the table and discuss things in late June.<br>
<br>
One of a couple of things will happen:<br>
<br>
1) Things will be ugly, in game fighting and this board will be ugly, and there will be a consensus to resume reservations and reform the process to minimize a few exploits (taking something like Adun's ideas as a foundation).<br>
<br>
2) Everyone will find out that with Kunark and Velious there's plenty to do in the game and better MoBs/items to raid then the ones sitting on reservations.<br>
<br>
There's a few subvariants that could occur... but they all lean generally in one or the other direction. <br>
<br>
The more I really think over the game in general, the more I'm starting to think that the FCFS crowd is right... half of them are still rabid lunatics, but they're at least correct rabid lunatics.<br>

If there was no reservation system then everyone that is serious about the game would be doing everything they can do get better at playing, get levels, etc, so that they have a chance at being good enough to get to the uber-spawn first without failing. Without that there is no reason to even try be the best, just to be good enough. And if you just need to only be 'good enough', then theres no reason to ever get over being afraid of Chardok/HS/etc, because 'good enough' can be achieved in Karnors<br>
<br>
I've certainly been trying to do other stuff, but it has never worked out. If you ever want to go to Chardok or whatever, most of the time you just need to &quot;/gu Anyone else interested in going to Chardok&quot; and your just about ready to go. Whenever I try and do that I find maybe one or two others that are willing too, but then it takes forever to find anyone else, and the first few I find go do something else. Back to where I started, fuck it, try and get a group myself in Sebilis, that or just log out. Whether thats mostly to blame on other people in general being too secure in Karnors, or because my Recruitment skill is -15, dunno. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessageRange?topicID=1548.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1546.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.showMessage?topicID=1524.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.threadControl?topicID=1548.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1548.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1548.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="brellserilisfrm67">Today's News<option value="brellserilisfrm48">Town Crier (Rules & Announcements)<option value="brellserilisbrellserilisdiscussion">The Commons (General EQ Discussion)<option value="brellserilisroleplaying">The Tavern (Roleplaying)<option value="brellserilisfrm66">Rants Link<option value="brellserilisfrm56">Salutations & Congratulations <option value="brellserilisfrm33">Dreams & Diversions (Off Topic)<option value="brellserilisfrm55">Fellowship of Guilds (Guildchat)<option value="brellserilisfrm64">Archived Threads<option value="brellserilisbrellslairadminonly">Brell's Lair (Admin only)<option value="brellserilismeleetalk">Tome: Races and Classes <option value="brellserilisfrm49">Tome: Visions of Norrath<option value="brellserilisfrm53">Tome: Heroes Rest (Retirements)<option value="brellserilisfrm58">Tome: The Book of Polls (Voting Booth)<option value="brellserilisplanesraids">Raids & Calendar: Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm42">Scheduling: Rotation Lists<option value="brellserilisschedulingnagafenorfiregiants">Scheduling: Nag, Vox, Trak, FG<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneoffear">Alter Plane: Fear<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofhate">Alter Plane: Hate<option value="brellserilisschedulingplaneofsky">Alter Plane: Sky<option value="brellserilisfrm46">Looking For More<option value="brellserilisfrm63">Raids: Archive<option value="brellserilisfrm27">The Bazaar (Buying Only)<option value="brellserilisfrm68">The Bazaar (Sales and Trades)<option value="brellserilisspellsandresearch">The Library (Spells and Research)<option value="brellserilisfrm51">Velious Gems<option value="brellserilisfrm65">Other Worlds: General Discussion<option value="brellserilisfrm60">Anarchy Online <option value="brellserilisfrm61">Dark Age of Camelot</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CC9900>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis>Brell Serilis</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fbrellserilisplanesraids>Raids & Calendar: Discussion</a> <font color=#CC9900> - </font><a href="http://www.brellserilis.net">Brell Serilis.net</a><font color=#CC9900> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
