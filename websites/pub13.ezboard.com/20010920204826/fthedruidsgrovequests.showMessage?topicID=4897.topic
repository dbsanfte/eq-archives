That's nothing....try doing it for 5 hours, then 2 hours, then 10.5 hours (!!!), then another 2 hours before getting him to spawn. In fact, I saw Lord Begurgle more than I saw tainted goblins. I also had to fend off other druids that are trying to get the camp. I even had one druid grill me on how far along I was compared to him, trying to reason that because he was further (that's the only part he needed apparently) and was lvl 59 (I was 54 at the time) that I should give him the camp regardless of the fact that I had been at the camp for hours before he decided to come along. I finally told him that I would /tell him after I left, he said 'OK' but didn't leave. He stayed camped out on the ledge above the tower watching and waiting while I killed the goblins. I have no doubt that had the tainted spawned he would have engaged it. This was the night of the 10.5 hour camp, he finally got tired or bored or whatever and left. I left shortly after in disgust.....<br>
<br>
I did get him eventually though, and the cleric I was with also got Begurgle 1 spawn after the corrupted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uxlechx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xLechx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/10/01 7:12:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corrupted Goblin....&lt;zzzzzzzzzz&gt;</span><hr size=1> Hehe if you can't stay awake 4 hours you might not wanna do the epic.  This one took me about 5 hours , but its noting compared to my 12 hour brownie and baracuda camp.  Taken me 70+ hours for just the corrupted mobs.  The many raids I've been to takes a lot of time also.  The epic takes many straight camps and patience, plus the druid epic is simple compared to others.   We can solo after all, Druid epic is mainly just a camp of time.  I passed time by talking to friends and buffing newbies....you coudl try that if you wanted.  <p>Lech<br>

Thank goodness for /guildchat and permanent EB items. <br>

Being in Lake of Ill Omen is the worst. I finally had to turn off /ooc /shout and /auction.<br>
<br>
I also killed Lord Berugule and grabbed helm for multiquest.<br>

Any clerics on Sol Ro need, send me a /tell it'll be a nice break in the monotony.<br>

I am doing that goblin now, myself and damn that dude does suck.  Haven't put in more then a few hours yet.  Maybe it is just me but those guys can get mean if you try to kill them underwater. <p><body>

I thought this thing was the absolute worst of the entire epic, even keeping watch for vsr over several days was easier.<br>
<br>
I camped this stupid, green, evil, mega caster/arrow shooter for DAYS AND DAYS. Finally another druid and fatty ogre huge warrior helped me one morning for 4 hours then the thing FIINALLY spawned. I had the corrupted SO MANY times with no drop or the ph or whatver, I forget now cause I kinda zoned out doing it for so long and dont' really want to think about it again. That was really a low point in EQ for me.<br>
<br>
Only verant would think that patience plus huge downtime = Epic instead of having actual difficulty = epic.<br>
<br>
Nothing in the whole dang quest seems epic to me except that dragon in timorous.. the rest is just stupid. <p><BR>

Went back with a mage friend who was bored, warned him it could be a longass camp, warned him he was likely to be bored stupid....first respawn was a tainted, who spawned a corrupted.  :)<br>

Terazz already had his corrupted piece, Phlynt and I both needed it, and Megumi needed the Lord.  Hearing how boring this camp was we thought sitting with friends/fellow guild mates would make it more fun.<br>
<br>
After a couple of hours we got the corrupted. Let Phlynt loot without /random since he was farther along his epic than I was.<br>
<br>
After a couple more hours Phlynt had to go, and then we all went LD at the same time (stupid server lag) and (of course) the Lord had spawned with full spawn of the other gobs when we got back.<br>
<br>
Silly (stupid???) me tried to take them on anyway with me and Terazz (I was running both me and Terazz and Megumi took longer than us to get back from LD land). Ended up getting all 3 of us killed from the adds (we were fighting up inside the tower instead of pulling them away to a safer spot = had been working all those hours before this /shrug).<br>
<br>
Megumi eventually got her Lord, but I never saw another corrupted that day. I have yet to take the time to camp that one again. <br>
