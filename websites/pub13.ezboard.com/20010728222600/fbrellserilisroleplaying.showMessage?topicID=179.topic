The beauty and grace of all high elven factions of society is marred by the simple violence that their Paladins are entrusted.  This is not to say that High Elven Paladins are not educated and intelligent, it is that they are the only faction to continuously find themselves knee deep in gore.  Still above the barbarian forms of fighting that warriors put themselves through, but a basic barbaric instinct nonetheless...something that High Elves unanimously attempt to suppress...<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The Halls of the King is where the ceremony is held.  Closed from the prying eyes and alert ears of the rest of Felwithe and Greater Faydark.  Those that enter Tunare's militant service are sometimes never seen after this ceremony, their graves hidden away as a shame to their families and the people.  Those that are seen after this day are Heroes proven by deeds and by this ceremony.<br>
<br>
The clanking of armor as the Squires were brought in.  In service to their Knight, these last years they were sent to the ends of Norrath to prove their worth.  Today would be a reckoning.<br>
<br>
Thorondar knelt with the others.  His armor mismatched, not a single piece of the prized Armor of Ro upon his body.  Nervously glancing among the recruits, he spied squires bearing full suits of the armor, a pristine contrast to his own mismatched blackened enameled breastplate, purchased from his companions adventuring in the depths of Lower Guk in their crusade against the undead frogloks, as well as the other seemingly ugly ensemble of armor.<br>
<br>
Lord Jhalen overlooked the crowd.  Nothing special amongst this crew he thought.  As always, the wealthier recruits sported the prized Armor of Ro, as well as those more dedicated to Tunare's cause, sacrificing their relations with the fairies of Faydwer in order to create the Ronium required for such armor.  The runt Thorondar had shown up this year for judgement.  His family, stripped of their namesake because of their Kinslayer, Fletop.  He was nameless, perhaps the last chance that family had for redemption within Felwithe.  Jhalen would kill Thorondar during the initiation.  His family's honor and stake within society would end here, fitting for the production of a Kinslayer.  The echoing footsteps and the flaring light from the King's Fiery Avenger alerted Jhalen to the beginning of the ceremony.  As the King and his procession took their seats to observe the ceremony, Jyleel donned his helm with grim certainty.<br>
<br>
In prayer they knelt.  Tunare, Mother of All, grant to me this day your favor and your divine grace to withstand your test.  I give you my heart and my spirit in defense of your name, our Kingdom and what is right.  The prayer went on, and differently within each young Knight to be.  Thorondar had nothing to add however, his mind tracing each battle that had brought him here.  The undead in lower guk, his companions allowing him to purchase the Holy Sword Ghoulbane they had found without him, the realization of the corrupt nature within the Frogloks to finally realize the undead frogloks would be no more if all the frogloks were destroyed...  The times Tunare had granted him his life again in the midst of battle, and the times Tunare had granted life to his companions at the sacrifice of his own life.  The resurrections done upon him in Tunare's name, and the release from Tunare's grasp that allowed him to carry on her work in Norrath.  He felt divine, a strength come from her name filled him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thorondar!&quot;, the voice commanded sharply.  Immediately, his heart sank.  The first was always the one to be beaten to an inch of his life.  The weaker of the &quot;Firsts&quot; could be slain, and Jhalen had slain fourteen in his career during this ceremony.  Those slain here, Tunare never let from her side, their bodies unresurrectable lay in the Graveyard of the Forgotten, those who were obviously lacking in their service to Tunare on Norrath.<br>
<br>
A scribe stepped forward, as Thorondar knelt before Lord Jhalen.  His accomplishments were weak given the time he had.  Nothing of note to the furthering of the High Elven Kingdom.  No greater good that manifested from his actions.  The only listing of actions that Thorondar held to his name and his ties to his family was the constant involvement in the destruction of undead in Tunare's service.  In every major battle, he had participated, and in every assignment to clear out undead threats, Thorondar had participated.  But, no detection of betrayals within the High Elven society, no stopping of the infiltration by the Teir'Dal had Thorondar done, unlike some of the others.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your actions in the service to Tunare are worthy, Thorondar.  Let these be the last blows you leave unanswered.&quot;, growled Jhalen as he drew his sword.<br>
<br>
This would be it, Thorondar thought.  If Tunare allows me to survive this, I will be proven in her name...<br>
<br>
The world stood still in those moments.  Glancing upward, Thorondar saw Jhalen's blade over him frozen in place, and a fully armored woman step out from behind him.  &quot;Tunare!&quot; he gasped, his eyes growing wide in instant recognition.  Her own blade, similar to the King's blazed brightly in her hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your actions in MY service are worthy, Thorondar.  Let THESE be the last blows you leave unanswered!&quot;, she stated.<br>
<br>
From his kneeling position, her plated boots struck him firmly in the chest, standing him up, and off balance.  Wielding her weapon in both hands, she smashed the pommel into his chest, knocking him backwards.  A sudden searing pain struck his shield arm, the vambraces glowing hot but holding as the flat of her blade struck him hard.  Impossibly fast, the blade whipped around, striking his opposite leg and sweeping his legs out from under him spinning him in midair head over heals.  Somehow managing to find his balance, he landed on his feet and knees, his mailed gauntlets punching the pristine tiled floors, causing a crack.  Thorondar glanced up at her, swearing he could see a crooked smile form under her plated helm.<br>
<br>
Real time entered again, he found himself 10 feet further away from Jhalen, his sword swooshing through the air where he had been.  A silence filled the room and the melodious voice of Tunare was clearly heard.  Her blade tapping the Thorondar's shoulders as he was surrounded by a blue healing aura.  &quot;Arise, Thorondar, my Fury.  Let no more blows against you remain unanswered in my service.  Begin your campaign against my enemy Cazic Thule.  Invade his plane, learn of his minions, and slay them in my name.  Go!&quot;, and with that, she vanished.<br>
<br>
His skin shimmered in a divine aura.  A deeper sense of purpose filled him; High Elven society meant nothing more to him.  Tunare had spoken, and her words meant more than whatever Jhalen could say.<br>
<br>
He turned to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thorondar!  Let these be the last blows you leave unanswered&quot;, screamed Jhalen as he continued the ceremony he had started.  Jhalen's mind filled with the rage of this pissant squire being knighted personally by Tunare?  Impossible!  The dark taint of Innoruuk must have caused that, he could be no Knight, much less a Fury of Tunare!  It must have been an illusion, his brother already openly worshipped the Deceiver, Lord of Hate, his Brother could only be as worthless.<br>
<br>
Jhalen's blade dug deeply into Thorondar's side.  The black enamaled breastplate had deflected most of the blade, but still it dug into his side.  Roaring in pain, Thorondar's mailed fist whipped backwards, backfisting Jhalen across the jaw and knocking him slightly backwards and off balance.  The cracked darkwood shield bashed into Jhalen as Thorondar whirled around to properly face Jhalen.<br>
<br>
The Guards started to move, but a motion from the King stopped them dead in their tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;No Knight of Tunare, much less a Fury has a Kinslayer within his family!&quot;, spat Jhalen.  &quot;Die like the dog your Brother is!&quot;<br>
<br>
Jhalen's blade began a flurry of strikes, as Thorondar's Ghoulbane parried and counterstriked.  Blade against blade, shield, and armor clanged as the two combatants crashed into each other, Thorondar steadily being backed into a corner.<br>
<br>
Then Jhalens' blade snapped.  A stab at Thorondar's armored chest was deflected into the wall as Thorondar shifted his weight and bashed his shield against the blade as it stabbed the wall.<br>
<br>
Unarmed, Jhalen knelt before Thorondar, awaiting the death blow.  His blade broken before him, he had lost this duel to the death.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tunare says not to kill elves.&quot;, whispered Thorondar as he sheathed his weapon and left the Hall.<br>

I'm in the process of finishing my own story, but I am looking for information on Tunare -- it seems like I have read bits and pieces about her different aspects and the ways different cultures view her, but now that I try and find them again, I can't find anything.  If you or anyone else know where I might dig up some of these tales, please let me know!<br>
Again, great story, I look forward to more about Tunare's Fury!<br>
