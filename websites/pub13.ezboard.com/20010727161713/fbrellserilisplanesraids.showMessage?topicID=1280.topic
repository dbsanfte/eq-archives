Sorry guys.  While I respect your real life issues, my only duty here is as a maintainer of the lists.  I don't really make or judge the rules, I just enforce them.  Because of that, I'm not at liberty to allow anyone to delay their raid or push back a few days.  I hope you understand this.  <br>

<br>
maybe its different for higher lvl dragons (never been on such a raid) but for low lvl dragons it would be better to allow people more time to organise the raids and have more successful ones - just my thoughts<br>
<br>
there have also been raids in the past where the raid failed and same guild gave it another try the next day thus violating the 48 hours rule and no one complained, no need to be so strict here - and you also did not delete their posts here.... <p>Camala<BR>

<br>
Just a suggestion here....but I definitely won't delete a post that says &quot;MY GUILD UP FOR VOX IN A WEEK OR SO -- sign up here if youre interested in going.&quot;  I mean, I might delete that post if you aren't in say...the top four or five, but if you're second, I would expect you'd have some sort of preliminary sign up thread here long before the previous raid fails or succeeds.<br>
<br>
Of course, some people will post &quot;I would like to be included, but I can only play on weekends&quot; or something like that, but at least you have a list of maybe 25 names to start with before your turn even begins.  If even half of those 25 names can make your raid, whenever it is, you're off to a good start.  I saw how many sign ups UNB got in only 24 hours.<br>
<br>
The rules for raid organization even suggest that it be done this way.  I'm sorry for the time limitations.  All I can say is, that's what the server voted for.  I'd love to just change the rules arbitrarily whenever I find something isn't working well, but I'm not empowered to do that. <p><BR>

<br>
Zesty, first off, you guys are doing a great job at helping keep us organized.  You're role or decision I don't think are in question here.  UNB had to pass based on the rules that were set up way back when, and that's understood.  The fact that the Brell server even HAS people willing to help with the rotation is commendable of itself.<br>
<br>
What I'm wondering is whether or not a new vote is in order.  The server is changing, and a new and different breed of people are coming to (and leaving!) the appropriate level for the old world dragons.  And it's true, Vox is living far more often than she is dying.<br>
<br>
I personally didn't sign up for Vox or Naggy because of the variances in when these raids occur.  I only have a few weeknights, and weekends to play with, and with an up-in-the-air raid time like these dragons tend to be, its hard to commit to something without knowing for sure that I can be there.  I'm from the old school, where you don't say you're going to be somewhere unless you're sure. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I guess all I really mean by this is that just because there's not a lot of sign ups doesn't mean there won't be a lot of people available and willing to help out.  UNB, as an example, was enlisting aid from other guilds, The Combine Alliance, I know for sure.  Several there would have helped, time permitting.<br>
<br>
To keep this as short as I can, in conclussion, I agree with a lot of what Camala stated.  If a new vote needs to be issued to get the rules changed, then a new vote needs to be issued, and if we're in the minority, so be it!  The people coming into the old world dragon raids are not always as experienced in raid leading as they were even two months ago.<br>
<br>
All I can say for sure is that Vox has not been falling.  Prep time is key.  And as I'm sure we all can relate to, we don't all fall under Verant's vision of &quot;have no RL life, or you won't succeed.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   In summary, I'd rather see more Vox's dead and her loot table safely in the hands of various Brell members than more Vox raid signups per month.<br>
<br>
Sorry!  I don't know for sure if this belongs here or in discussion, or somewhere else entirely, so if I've posted somewhere that I shouldn't, please feel free to move or delete the post.

I think Vox should be monitored and if enough raid leaders are seeing a problem with finding support then perhaps a revote should take place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uganaddor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ganaddor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/23/01 10:45:04 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.com/G36206?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: UNB -- please read</span><hr size=1> Raid discussion may be the better place to discuss this but since everyone replies here I reply here as well.<br>
<br>
I actually have no trouble with Zesty, I will do the same if I were him to enforce the rule. However what I think is this 48 hour limit must be changed.<br>
<br>
Back in many months ago when there were no time limit of attempting dragons some guilds didn't even post anything for over a week when their turns were up. The next one in rotation ended up waiting there for over a week or 2 just for the No. 1 to say something to pass. Dikamin suggested at that time that the raid organisers must post their intention (it's intention, not attempt) within 48 hours and most people suggested to be 72 hours of posting intention and this guideline was used when Chingon was the moderator. The new set of rules has been passed earlier that made the 48 hour limit.<br>
<br>
I suggest this should be 48 hours to post intention, not attempting. Time limit for attempting may be 5 days or so if previous raid failed as this was the approximately the average no. of days to attempt Naggy and Vox previously after a failed raid. Most Vox/Naggy raid organisers can't even get more than half from their guilds as opposed to Trakanon and VS.<br>
<br>
For me I am not going to be included in the rotation again as I can't say for certain I can do a raid within a 48 hour period and I don't know the days ATM. And I have told myself I won't sign up on any dragon raid that appeared to be insufficient preparation. <p>Ganaddor Saolinlight<BR>

A small guild or novice raid leader simply can't round up the personel needed for a difficult raid that quickly.<br>
<br>
Many in our guild are over the 52 limit. That creates problems. Many people in our guild were working diligently to make 45 so they could resonably contribute to the raid if they attended. Our small guild also has some class deficiencies that we must fill in order to even have a chance at defeating VOX.<br>
<br>
But it came up so fast and we were so rushed that we simply could not muster the people needed to do it.<br>
<br>
This event has contributed to my decision to look elsewere for my addictive entertainment. The concept of needing mass quantities of people to kill a dragon is as it should be. Unfortunately, the limitations placed on who can assist based on level, skills, and time constraints IMHO simply takes the fun out of raiding. <br>
<br>
For my freinds who are not so jaded toward EQ though, I ask that the Brell community reconsider its guidelines. Other ervers don't seem to have near as much trouble taking VOX down as ours does. Why is that? <p>Kros Cloudwalker,

But since the thread has started, here's my 2 cents.....<br>
<br>
Vox has a one week spawn rate, so in essence you have one week and 48 hrs to get your raid organized.  I DO realize this is shortened when a raid fails, the next raiders in line only have 2 days to get organized then.  But I have also been apart of a successful raid on less than 12 hrs notice.  No shows tend to be the biggest problem IMO.  Raid leaders can not prepare properly if people are just signing hoping they can make it, but not really sure whether or not they can.  I think if we can get vox to fall, things will smooth out a bit and we will see a longer string of victories than we have as of late.<br>
<br>
Then again, this is just my opinion, I could be wrong.<br>

All the experienced people who could kill vox easily are 52+, a ton of people signed up who have no business being on the list, therefore whenever a Vox raid fails, it ends up giving the next raid not enough time to plan. IMO the answer is clear up all the redundant raids, put Vox under Adun's system so only the serious Vox raiders will remain. <p>nillon<br>

<br>
There are 3 Darkguard members that are still at L52 so they can do dragon raids.  They've been on a number of Vox raids recently.<br>
<br>
THE RAID LEADERS DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE.  They didn't know how to run a Vox Raid.  They didn't know that you can't stun Vox to interrupt CH.  They weren't mana draining.  They had too many people of insufficient level.<br>
<br>
How long is the stupid list anyways?  If all of the guilds on the list are too small to muster the proper forces to kill Vox, then perhaps some of the guilds should combine forces?<br>
<br>
Hint: You can buff your raiders with L60 Buffs.  Tanks with Aegolism, Rune 5, Shissar, Focus, Circle Resist spells. . . There's tremendous advantage here.<br>
<br>
Adun's only a sliver into 53.  If the damn Vox list wasn't a mile long, I'd sac Adun &amp; run a raid.  Unfortunately, becuase there's so much dead weight (guilds that aren't active, guilds that are all over 52 now, guilds that never had the numbers, but just signed up to get a spot on the list. . .) on the Vox list, it's not worth my time.<br>
<br>
Vox isn't a 12 hour raid.  It's something you can easily do on a weeknight.  It shouldn't be that hard to get the required numbers together. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune.jpg" width="315" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukruuunch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kruuunch</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim</span><br>  Posts: 1301<br> <font color=#CC9900>(1/24/01 9:15:05 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.krunch.net/kruunch-face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion on Vox rotation....</span><hr size=1> I'm a big proponent of smaller guilds raiding dragons (Nag and Vox specifically) but to be perfectly frank, it wouldn't matter to MOST of the failed Vox raids if you gave them 2 weeks to plan the raid. They still would of failed.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a for instance....<br>
<br>
Guild X hosted a Vox raid last week. Two Spiritslammers signed up to go on it. They were both casters. At the raid (not before) they were told that casters wouldn't be able to roll on a white dragon scale (only bards could for their epics). That raid had two nukers; a mage and a wizard. But it had 5 bards (one of them 32nd level). Given these facts (both the &quot;on-the-spot&quot; loot rule and lack of appropriate classes and levels) our guys promptly withdrew.<br>
<br>
THIS HAS BEEN COMMONPLACE!<br>

And not for lack of knowledge. I've been on numerous Vox raids, two of which failed. One for lack of the right classes (wizzies specifically) which I told the raid leader before hand, and one from lack of knowledge on the raid leader's part (he didn't know you could agro the bears below).<br>
<br>
And while I really don't want to sound elitist, MOST of the people on that Vox list have absolutely no business hosting a dragon raid. MOST of those raid leaders have never even been to a Vox raid before.<br>
<br>
See my point?<br>
<br>
48 hours isn't unreasonable for a raid leader who is on the ball. 72 hours might be a little easier on the stress levels however in my experience with the current Vox raiders, the extra time would of made absolutely no difference in the outcome of the raid.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw, I don't do much more then /who all &lt;class&gt; &lt;lvl&gt; &lt;lvl&gt; to pick up the extra people I need to make a raid successful. If you are short people try that. <p><FONT face="arial" size="-1"><B>Kruunch Spiritslammer (Ugliest Paladin o' Kaladim)

How are they ever to become accomplished raid leaders if they dont ever try leading raids. I am sure most who are established leaders would not have liked someone telling them they had no business being on the list since they had never lead a raid before. I think a lot of you are to quick to bash others for not being up to your standards. So the raids fail..its called a learning expierence. If you never let them try they will never learn to be a good raid leader. <p>Lotara Silvermist <br>

<br>
the voted rules: we just had the chance to vote for the whole pack of rules together or against it - not to just agree to most of them but not to the 48 hours rule...<br>
<br>
48 hours rule... there is a patch on the 24th and i think vox was not killed on the 23rd because the according thread on this board was deleted for violating the 48 hours rule... please do not use the rule in a way where it causes dragons to be wasted. Aside from this (like i stated before) i think 48 hours is not enough, and i would never sign up for a raid that does not post an exact date and time - it just makes no sense cause i have also RL things to plan...<br>
<br>
of course dragon raids would be more successful if we were all expert raiders, but many aren't. i've been on 14 dragon raids so far (7 successful and 7 failes ones) and i think i know the important points and also have the proper resist gear but many don't. having more time to prepare the raid would increase number of successes<br>

I think a question should be answered...if the raid leader can't even get on ONE raid, then how is he/she going to muster up the support to have the necessary classes there?  There are some people that I know are first timers when hosting something..but they have done their research on what works and what doesn't.  They KNOW what classes are vital to take, they know how many it takes, they know the technique of taking the thing down. These people will CANCEL the raid if they dont' have what it takes..not just simply go through with it and then deal with a blood bath. There are a lot of ppl out there that will hold a raid and say screw the fact that they know they need other classes in order to be successful.  A lot of people just hold one, tell people to charge, and then hope they charged enough ppl at it so that they can claim a drop off the dragon.  This is seriously how a lot of these &quot;first timer&quot; raids happen.<br>
<br>
The other point is, there is a lot of responsibility when one of these people who doesn't research and leads these things.  It could even result in someone who has really worked hard for their items on their body, to never getting their body back.  I am willing to bet that there are some necros that can probably tell you some summoning stories of bodies being left by a raid host that didn't know what to do.  I don't think Kruunch is being judgemental or harsh.  To not learn from an experienced raid leader is just pure ignorance I think.<br>
<br>
Back on topic, I basically agree with Kruunch.<br>

I, too, was on the raid you brought up.  However, some of the facts are wrong.  First, it was posted about the scale prior to the raid.  When I saw it I thought cool, but then realized that casters would hold out.  When the leader was asking for help to reinforce the raid, I was hoping that he told them the rules on the scale while asking them.  Not sure if he did or not.  I even thought about asking him to change it because of the lack of casters.  But folks get touchy when you bring up loot rules.  The scale roll limit was not placed upong the raid at the time of the raid.<br>
<br>
Yes, there was a 32 bard in the zone, but I did not see him go through the buff circle.  I did step away, as bards do, for a brief time to get a drink, but not for long.<br>
<br>
The raid failed due to the pit being dragged up to Vox's lair, things were fine til that point.  The pit was pulled by either a feared pet going into a pit or the fact that some bards were using AE mana draining songs.  Personally, I think the songs did it. /shrug<br>
<br>
As far as rule changes go, post your intent in 48 hours after a successful or failed raid, period.  I don't care if the next spawn is a week away.  If the raid is after a successful raid, you got 48 hours to make your attempt upong the respawn.  If the raid is after a failed or passed raid, you have 72 hours to kill or pass.  Pretty simple and gives a bit more time to follow after a fail/pass raid.<br>
<br>
On a side note, why is Naggy still waiting on an intent from the current folks.  I'd thought it would of passed by now too.  /shrug<br>

The current time frames for posting intent and taking your shot is more then satisfactory.  If you can't field a raid crew in that time you most likely lack the resources to be successful.<br>

I can understand how the confusion could happen as we have only been a Guild on Brell since Aug. 1999 (sorry, I couldn't resist).<br>
<br>
As this is the second typing of this, I am going to keep it short (stupid fingers).<br>
<br>
If only experienced raid leaders should be able to lead raid, then Vox, Naggy or any other &quot;raid&quot; mob would never have been killed.  The only way to become a sucessful raid leader is to have done it.  The first people to do it had no experience.  Who is anyone to say who should be able to or not be able to lead a raid?  So much for trying new ways.<br>
<br>
I feel it safe to say that Adun is a good Fear puller.  I bet that he was not a good Fear puller the first time he went there.  He learned by doing.  I was on the raid when he tried pulling in both directions for the first time.  Pulling the TT's, Spiders and Apes and then pulling the Mares, Jellos and Glares.  It didn't work so well on that raid, but at least he tried and may well have discovered a better way of pulling Fear.<br>
<br>
The UNB has experienced members that can lead raids.  It just so happens that the Guild before us made their attempt on a Saturday.  We found out on Sunday that we had 48 hours to complete our attempt.  We gathered our forces and put out word (sign-up) to our friends that we would attempt Vox on Monday.  Then, the raid leader had a RL issue come up and we needed to postpone.  I am out of town for the week and could not take over.  It is unfortunate because I think we could have taken Vox out on Tuesday, but we will never know.<br>
<br>
As far as loot goes, the UNB was not reserving any loot for ourselves, everything was going to be randomed...<br>
<br>
Perhaps 72 hours would make more sense.  As it stands now, Vox has been alive much longer than any of us would like.<br>

<br>
Under the current time limit you essentially have first day to get people signing up and the 2nd day to do the raid. If you can't do it in the 2nd day then you can pretty much forget about this raid. It is possible to do /who all in game to get the people though.<br>
<br>
I agree that many folks in the rotation do not have good experience (may be only failing experience) but I have seen a raid leader with little or no Vox experience able to kill Vox with the help from a large guild.<br>
<br>
Maybe not all of us agree to my 5 day proposal but I think 72 hour time limit will make the rotation moving fast enough while peep have more time to prepare the raid. <p>Ganaddor Saolinlight<BR>

<br>
and i'm not talking about raids with long sign ups, but made within hours after we decide to kill the mob<br>
<br>
use the people signing up and send TONS of tells to everyone you know asking them if they'd like to come or know someone who would<br>
<br>
ask people to ask their guilds too, some people might be playing alts<br>

the dragon raids i've been to with my rogue usually lack the good classes... no you dont need 10 paladins and rangers for a raid <p><BR>
