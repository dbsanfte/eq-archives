Why is that?  Sorry if somebody in another realm has fear spells. <br>
<br>
Also, from what i've been reading, am i correct in assuming that named mobs do drop special loot?  I could've sworn Mythic wasnt going to do that so camping wouldnt be a problem.  Although camping is evident in a few of the places i've been, especially in dungeons.  Kinda stupid how they've stockpiled alot of the magic stuff to drop in dungeons and not more randomized outdoors.  <br>
<br>
Also, i believe i read on the latest patch message that they would be 'itemizing' 35+ loot or something along those lines.  Does this mean that theyre just going to list the loot they've created for 35+ players?   <br>

<br>
No, there are no fear spells in DAoC.   I havn't really missed them to be honest.<br>
<br>
As for named, they are usualy for quests.  Sometimes not, sometimes they are just for flavor.  No they don't have drops like in EQ.  Dungeons have the best loot.  It is totally random.  Why do they ahve better loot than outdoors? Well cause its more dangerous!   You are STILL better off not &quot;camping&quot; a dungeon.  You are much better off moving through it, always moving.<br>
<br>
You can still get good magic drops outside.   They are more rare yes, but its also a whole lot easier killing and stying alive out there.  I've gotten a number of random dropsout in the middle of no where.  They are often very nice.  At least as nice or better than what I'd get in a dungeon at the same level.  But it seems to be totally random. You can NOT camp stuff in the EQ way of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Itemizing&quot; was in refernce to a dungeon in Albion (the one under Stonehenge I THINK) that was just dropping coin.)  To get the game out on time some things had to slide a bit.  Now they've had time to do the little fiddly bits and this dungeon now has a list of items that will drop there.  They are level 35-50.  Its a level 35-50 dungeon so that SORTA makes sense to me. Yes?  <br>

<br>
&quot;No, there are no fear spells in DAoC. I havn't really missed them to be honest.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was just curious since every other spell EQ has is in DAOC, so why not fear?  Fear was a very mainstream type spell, and is a spell in most fantasy type games.  Wasnt complaining about this btw, was just curious why a pretty mainstream spell wasnt put in.<br>
--------<br>
<br>

You are much better off moving through it, always moving.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what dungeons you've done.  Maybe higher lvl ones are like what your saying, but i spent everyday in Tomb of Mithra between lvl 10-14 or so.  There IS camping, and nobody was better off moving through them.  In fact the ones that kept moving were the ones that got wiped out.  You'd be surprised how many things were down a hall that you couldnt see, and how much stuff would just jump on you if you were to just keep moving.  Also, the difficulty of monster gets more difficult as you move deeper, so there really is no point for a group of a particular lvl to move through a dungeon.  Either they'd start out by fighting cons that are good for them then move into stuff more difficult that they couldnt take anyways, or they'd just skip the cons that are gray to them and camp down where they are blue or higher.  I know in theory Mythic was supposed to design dungeons to prevent camping, but all i've seen are people camping areas and in most cases using Mythics policy of 'there isnt supposed to be camping' to fight other people for mobs which basically just turns into a free-for-all.  Anybody that has hit the lowest lvl of Mithra Tomb where the named stuff spawns should know what i mean.  In regards to named, i've received a few magic stuff from them, but i havent killed enough to really see if they do drop special loot(well, they did drop useless special loot as far as i know like mortar and pestle and stuff like that).  What makes me wonder though is everybody is fighting over a named when it spawns.  <br>

&quot;You can still get good magic drops outside. They are more rare yes, but its also a whole lot easier killing and stying alive out there.

But it seems to be totally random. You can NOT camp stuff in the EQ way of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
As far as dungeons 'are supposed to have much more loot because they are dangerous' i can agree with.  However, the problem with that is it crowds a dungeon, as if their not small enough to begin with anyways, and the fact that the drop rate outside is very rare.  I've received drops outside as well, but comparing the drop rate of magic items outside to in a dungeon isnt even comparable.  A dungeons magic item drop rate is way, way higher.  In anycase, regardless of difficulty, all Mythic is doing by focusing magic items in dungeons is making them VERY crowded with tons of  competetion, i.e. fighting for spawns and camp spots.  Has anybody else experienced this?  It cant just be my server(Pellinor) :P   <br>

<br>
I see.  I wasnt sure what they meant exactly by itemizing it.  So they just put magic item drops in, thought they might mean by putting out some list of what drops where or something like sites like Allakhazams or Stratics has.<br>

<br>
For the record, i dont try and become a cynic on purpose.  In fact i try and like a game.  I liked UO and i liked EQ, and at least it took me 3 years and 1 year to get jaded on those.  I didnt like AO, and i'm starting to become less enamoured with DAOC.  The hype is way over-exaggerated imo, since i see how wonderful and perfect a game DAOC is in alot of places(even on UO boards).  I just like to tell it like it is, and although people WANT to believe DAOC is the greatest game, its far from it imo.   I find the gameplay more redundant than almost any other mmorpg i've played so far.   I force myself to log in these days just so i can advance further in my lvling treadmill with basically no end in sight since RvR is all about lvl.  Not much to do other than that.  Granted, the game is new and some would say AO is still new.  Those arent excuses imo for saying how great and wonderful a game is when it currently isnt.  Maybe its just me though, but i'd advice anybody that hasnt played DAOC and reading all the hype about it, dont believe alot of it.<br>

If you aren't enjoying it (forcing yourself to log in sounds like you aren't) why are you playing?   I'd have quite! ;)<br>
<br>
Well we've done Spraggon Dena d a dungeon way up north. can't member the name.  We were on on the weekend early in the morning, IE not crowded and left when teh crowds showed up.  Once you get higher moving around gets better. We ahd a bard and found if we DIDN'T keep moving we'd be more likely to get wiped out.  Since respawn can be litteraly seconds after you clean out a room you ahve to learn what halls are safe and you clear a room and then hop intot he enxt hall to regen.   <br>
<br>
Crowding is an issue if you're playing during prime-time.  They definately need more dungeons.  But there are also good dungeons out there OCMPLETELY unused.  There is one I&quot;ve been in where my group would be the ONLY people htere.  Another dungeon meant for the SAME level range is always crammed.  Why? Cause it was found first and folks just follow one another instead of exploring. :) <br>
<br>
Hopefully Mythic will be adding more dungeons soon.  We could use them, but if you do dungeons at off peak times and realy exp play in out of the way areas during peak it really isn't bad. :)<br>
<br>
I'm not terribly with it today, think I'm coming down with something so hope that was all coherent. ;)  <br>
<br>
When I said itemized I didn't mean just adding magic items, I mean adding EVERYTHING. ;) Including vendor loot.  The non itemized dungeson teh mobs drop HUGE amounts of cash. But not even a spare button otherwise.  So it evens out.  So they're adding all the vendor loot and the useable items too.  They've been going through since release and adding loot to all the higher level dungeons.   <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

Camping?</span><hr size=1> Well no matter how much Mythic or any other MMORPG company, for that matter would like to prevent camping, I honestly don't think it's 100% possible.  Mythic has done a decent job minimizing outdoor camping.  Dungeons for example, will always be camped.  What's wrong with named mobs dropping special items?  They're a special mob, why not drop a special item?  And why shouldn't dungeons have better loot? They're harder to fight in.  I've died many more times per night fighting in a dungeon than all my times added outdoors.<br>
<br>
People camp a specific spot in a dungeon for many reasons, one being that that spot is potentially safe for them.  Like you said, the ones moving around are the ones that gets wiped out.  Well, greater the risk, greater the gain.  Moving around increases your risks.  <br>
<br>
Of course you're not gonna be able to see further down a hall.  Your vision can only go so far.  We're playing a fantasy game, not a superheroes game.  Our characters don't have extended vision.  It also would make no sense to create a dungeon with mobs that are all the same lvl.  Dungeons are designed for you to group, strategize, and grow into.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly I've gotten more and better items outdoors than in a dungeon.  I've gotten a lot of magic items which I can wear for longer periods of time outdoors than in dungeons where I've only gotten armor that greens out after a few lvls.  I like fighting in dungeons because it's a LOT more challenging than fighting outdoors.  Outdoor fighting makes it too easy to run away when things go wrong, whereas in a dungeon, you're forced to strategize, and think.<br>
<br>
As for fear spells.  Sure most mythological and fantasy games have them.  But is Mythic obligated to put them in DAoC?  They're allowed to be different.  I think a lot of us are just too used to play EQ and expecting certain things.  We just need to unlearn what we've learned in EQ and start fresh.  While DAoC is similar in many ways, it is still a whole new game.  I'm sure EQ lacked somethings that was in D&amp;D, but people made do with what they were given.<br>
<br>
You don't need fear spells since you can easily out run a mob and have it forget you with sprint.  Other than fear kiting what else do you need it for?<br>
<br>
I honestly wouldn't wanna play DAoC if it was EXACTLY like EQ.  I mean, I worked hard to achieve what I got in EQ and lvl my chars, why leave if it wasn't for something different? <p><CENTER>

Because DAOC is not Everquest.  There are spells in DAOC that didn't exist in Everquest, and there are spells in Everquest that don't exist in DAOC.

More "redundant" (I think you mean "repetitive" or "monotonous") than Everquest?  Care to explain how that's even possible?  Perhaps you're having trouble remembering what Everquest gameplay was like when you started:  kill a small army of similarly-looking NPCs, gain items, and level.

<br>
Actually, you cant name many DAOC only spells that arent renamed or redone in some manner by EQ but are generally the same thing.  What i mean is the damage bonus spells are equivalent to a damage shield from EQ.  Shields are similar to runes.  Elemental summons for Theurgs are similar to DoT's.  And i could go on and on...regardless, i was just curious why they wouldnt include fear type spells.  If its for fear of kiting, i'm pretty sure Wizzies kite, well i guess if you call root-nuking kiting.  Theurgs can kite as well with aggro kiting.  Whats wrong with kiting anyways?  It takes more skill than the way every class currently solo's.  <br>
---------<br>
<br>
L-O-L. That's plainly evident from your posting history in the past 6 months.  <br>
<br>
Well, i guess i am a cynic often but i also think i dont get carried away like others do.  If you remember correctly i wasnt the one praising AO for how great and revolutionary it was.  It clearly wasnt, although many people at the time thought it was.  And i'm sorry to you people who cant stand a bad opinion on DAOC but i really dont think its nearly as great as some of you make it out to be, especially in comparison to EQ.  As of right now, only the graphics are better, EQ has way more depth(yes, DAOC is new, but we're talking about now), and more options of what you can do when your bored.  I'm sure DAOC will improve, but right now it doesnt deserve the hype and yes, it CAN be very boring.<br>

<br>
It is possible because my whole goal is to lvl, lvl, lvl, and if i dont want to lvl there isnt anything else to do.  I'm not looking forward to anything but just seeing the bar move.  I know some people resent the equipment customizing of EQ, but i miss it.  In fact, going for equipment was a nice option other than lvling.  Its pointless for the most part in DAOC.  Even quests are more detailed in EQ than DAOC.  That is not to say EQ is perfect, but if i reccomended a game to somebody that had never played EQ or DAOC, i would reccomend EQ.  I did realm combat and proceeded to get wiped out by high cons.  So what do i need to do?  I need to lvl :P  I'm sure it'll be fun if we all reach 50.  <br>
----------<br>
<br>
Frankly, I think if you are forcing yourself to play any game, you've got some issues. Best to back off from gaming entirely for a while, or play games you enjoy. <br>
<br>
Well, i find that statement somewhat hypocritical.  Every one of us goes through the lvling treadmill, and after so much of it, your not looking forward to it.  I'm sure there are a few people who really look forward to every moment of the same routine, but i dont believe 99% of us do.  Many people reached the 50's in EQ because they set it as a goal.  They logged in many times during that span just for the painful purpose to get exp that night to reach that goal.  Many of those people cant say they looked forward every night to root/doting/med redundancy.  Its very similar to what macroing has become in UO.  People will only log in for powerhour where their skills gain at double rate, but it only lasts an hour, and recycles every 24hours.  Most people arent chopping trees because they like to double click on trees, they want to gain and many people force themselves to take out an hour daily right-clicking trees to reach their goal to be GM in that skill.  In terms of other games, i'm playing MaxPayne btw, and it lives up to all the hype.  I'm not a fps fan but MaxPayne is unbelievable.  I already purchased DAOC and i'm going to pull the break-away for abit like i used to do with EQ.  Its just kinda sad that i already feel this way.  <br>
<br>
In anycase, you can label me a cynic for not liking a whole lot of games.  I probably am because i think alot of games do get very boring especially when they dont have much depth to them.  It also has to do with the fact that so many games these days come out with so much hype, and the expectations that hype sets are a lot to live up to.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/28/01 11:38:01 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/lynxhead.jpg WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What happened to fear spells?

<br>
Well sweetie, perhaps you should change your goal in DAoC. There are plenty of things for you to do other than lvling all the time. Try a trade skill...better yet, try 2 or 3 or 4.  That way you can make your own armor and don't have to wait for it to drop.  Not to mention you can make a lot of money doing consignment quests for various NPCs, as well as help out other realm-mates in making armor for them. You'll see that trade skills in DAoC are a HUGE improvement than the ones in EQ.  At least you don't have to spend months gathering supplies in attempts to get your skill up ONE measly point.  (Don't believe me? Go to eqtraders.com and read the rants there from frustrated tailors and other people in pursuit of trade skills.)  Trade skills are a great way to break the monotony of lvling.  If you're gonna do nothing but pursue exp day in and day out, well yeah you're gonna be bored no matter which game you play or how well the game is developed.<br>
<br>
And I really beg to differ that EQ quests are more detailed than DAoC ones. But then again, it's all a matter of opinion I guess.  But consider this: every quest given to my by my trainer in DAoC have been worthwhile and has an interesting story to it.  When was the last time someone around 15th lvl was able to do a quest that yielded a worthwhile item in EQ?  Epic quests in EQ are a joke no less.  It forces you to bicker with other people on your server over whose right it is to kill an insanely tough mob that requires you to recruit 40 people to defeat. Epic quests in DAoC?  It has a storyline, I can start it at 15th, yields some really nice sub items as I go along, and it continues for a good 15 lvls.  Most importantly, I don't need 40 people with uber equipment to help me.  I can accomplish what I need with a few skillful people.<br>
<br>
Sure most of us play to gain that new lvl or skill so our characters can be stronger and better.  But then again, most of us don't force ourselves to log on to a game to do that.  I personally enjoy the game, therefore, I log on and play it.  If I don't enjoy it anymore, or if it bores me, then I cancel the account and stop playing.  Hence why I no longer play EQ. ;)  Sure most of us don't enjoy looking forward to the same routine, (unless we get paid to do it, IE work) but if you're gonna enjoy a game, then you have to explore your options within the game to find ways to make it fun and exciting.  If you're forcing yourself to enjoy games, why do you even bother with buying them and playing them to begin with?  Do something else you know you will like.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think Mythic's done a good job so far with DAoC's concept. <p><CENTER>

<br>
For one, there's no mind confusion spell in Everquest, and that's far more useful than fear.  Also while many of the spells have a similar function (both games just have subsets of the AD&D spell list, after all), they operate differently enough that you wouldn't use them in the same way.  For example, both the crippling spells in DAOC and the root spells in Everquest are designed to hold a target in place (or nearly so), but in DAOC you can't "root and DoT" or "root and nuke" as in Everquest, and in Everquest you don't have fixed durations as in DAOC.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Whats wrong with kiting anyways? It takes more skill than the way every class currently solo's.</b></i><br>
<br>
The developers were obviously obsessed with preventing kiting, as there are about five redundant safeguards in the game to prevent you from using a speed advantage to kill unusually hard NPCs.  I saw a post by someone at Mythic stating that they had to prevent kiting because it could unbalance the game moreso than in Everquest due to the extremely low downtime in DAOC.<br>
<br>
<b><i>And i'm sorry to you people who cant stand a bad opinion on DAOC but i really dont think its nearly as great as some of you make it out to be, especially in comparison to EQ. As of right now, only the graphics are better, EQ has way more depth, and more options of what you can do when your bored.</b></i><br>
<br>
Everquest has more depth?  ROFL.  Care to cite specific examples for gameplay at your level, even given the current state of DAOC to the matured state of Everquest?<br>
<br>
<b><i>It is possible because my whole goal is to lvl, lvl, lvl, and if i dont want to lvl there isnt anything else to do. I'm not looking forward to anything but just seeing the bar move.</b></i><br>
<br>
Well then maybe the problem isn't the game, it's you.  You can do trade skills, you can do quests, you can enter realm combat -- you have at least as many options as EQ offers.<br>
<br>
I also suggest getting out and grouping.  Unlike Everquest, grouping is almost always more efficient experience-wise, and you can group with just about anyone without worrying about a "necessary" class.<br>
<br>
<b><i>I know some people resent the equipment customizing of EQ, but i miss it. In fact, going for equipment was a nice option other than lvling.  Its pointless for the most part in DAOC.</b></i><br>
<br>
Why is going for equipment "pointless" in DAOC?  How is it more meaningful in Everquest?<br>
<br>
<b><i>Even quests are more detailed in EQ than DAOC.</b></i><br>
<br>
Umm what?  Even looking at Everquest most favorably and DAOC least favorably, they're about comparable.  Have you started your epic quest?<br>
<br>
<b><i>Every one of us goes through the lvling treadmill, and after so much of it, your not looking forward to it.</b></i><br>
<br>
I agree with you there.  I don't like level-based MMRPGS either; that's one of the reasons I'm eagerly anticipating Star Wars Galaxies.  However, I don't see how this makes DAOC worse than Everquest, since they're both leveling games.<br>
<br>
<b><i>I probably am because i think alot of games do get very boring especially when they dont have much depth to them.</b></i><br>
<br>
Depth is really a double-edged sword.  A deep game offers more possibilities, yet it also requires more effort to learn and adjust.  No MMRPG is like Max Payne, where you read a bit about the controls and get right into wasting enemies.  If you're looking for immediate satisfaction, don't play a MMRPG.<br>
<br>
<b><i>but if i reccomended a game to somebody that had never played EQ or DAOC, i would reccomend EQ</b></i><br>

<br>
Camping is massivly reduced, most named/quest mobs respawn very quickly, for one time only and quest items everyone in the group gets the item, so you dont need to kill the same mob 8 times for everyone in the group to get an item.<br>
<br>
However, at higher levels due to the lack of content camping is an issue. For example on Midgard there are currently no lvl 35+ large shields, no craftsmen yet able to make anything even blue con to a lvl 35. That leaves 2-3 known medium/small shields that drop of mobs, of these at lvl 35 our group is capable of just one camp, along with 150 other players needing a shield.<br>
<br>
So far we must of put in 20+ hours and got zero shields, as I play a defensive warrior having a good shield for my level is very important. Player made is not an option, with weaponcrafting at 665 the best player made shield is green, probably turn grey next level. <p><A HREF="http://www.e-panaphobia.com/daoc/"><IMG SRC="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/nigel_b/kibuka.jpg">

Camping?</span><hr size=1> There are actually a number of spell types from EQ that aren't in DAoC. Spells like gate, self ports and group ports don't exist in DAoC. On the other hand DAoC has a damage enhancement for weapons spell line (for several classes) that EQ doesn't (and no these aren't the equivalent of EQ damage shields, DAoC has it's own line of damage shield spells). It's just a question of style.<br>
<br>
When you think about any computer role-playing (term is used loosely for computer games) game there are actually very few base spell effects. There is direct damage, damage over time, protection, enhancement, healing, neutralizing and movement. Pretty much any spell or game effect can be lumped into one of these categories. It comes down to how it is implemented (what you call it and what the graphic effect looks like).<br>
<br>
Direct Damage can be anything from a sword hit to a fire spell from a wizard. Damage over Time can be anything from an acid cloud spell with a set number of rounds of effect, to an elemental from a theurgist or a bleed component from an attack style.<br>
<br>
For ANY game it's just a question of what the effect is called, looks like and how it's implemented.<br>
<br>
Is there camping? Sure there is. Is it better? No, but some people prefer it because it gives them a set (though typically diminishing returns) amount of experience in a given time with minimal risk. Moving through a dungeon while riskier provides better rewards in terms of experience. How? By your own statement you walk down the hallway and get jumped by 3-4 mobs at once. This gives you a HUGE experience bonus for fighting multiple mobs at once. In EQ in most dungeons you had to fight multiple mobs to break a 'room'. While this was supposed to provide a greater 'challenge' you were not rewarded for this greatly increased risk in any form or fashion. At least DAoC gives you a VERY visible reward for the risk you take.<br>
<br>
Even though some people fight over spawns it really isn't that big a deal (at least IMO) for a couple of reasons. First is that even if someone else does over half the damage they won't get all the exp for killing a mob you engaged first (or thought you did). They will merely get a portion of experience relative to the damage they did. Second is that the mobs respawn VERY quickly, two or three minutes is typical. Not like having to wait 29 minutes for the mob to respawn in say LGUK after some high level KS'ed a named from your group or DAYS for some of the quest mobs.<br>
<br>
You really should explore some of the other options like the quests (while they aren't excellent full blown novels, they do hold up much better than EQ quests for consistency) and tradeskills. I could probably be at least 10 levels higher than I am on several characters, but I sit around messing with tradeskills and consignments for a good bit each level and make good cash doing it as well. For me this really breaks up the leveling treadmill.<br>
<br>
Anytime I find myself having to force myself to play a game, I take a couple of weeks off from the game. If after the break I still don't like the game I'll take a couple more weeks off. If I still am reluctant to play the game then it's time for me to move on to another game.<br>
<br>
I will agree with Broomhilda in that a lot of times the hype for a new game is blown out of proportion. The thing to remember is that little things that make one game different from another will have a large impact on how it makes different people feel about the game. Broomhilda misses the 'equipment cusomizing of EQ'. Personally I LOATHED having to go camp a specific named spawn for a specific piece of equipment. Different tastes in gameplay. ::shrug::<br>
<br>
Me? I have kept my EQ account because I wanted to see how I felt about EQ after a couple of months and how I felt about DAoC after a month or so. I'll be cancelling my EQ account in the near future.<br>
<br>
Why DAoC over EQ? I much prefer the downtime to gaming ratio in DAoC to EQ. I much prefer the quests in DAoC. I prefer the tradeskills. I like seeing how much experience I'm getting for killing a mob (and the different bonuses that encourage you to take on camps and then move on). I like the interface with the exception of F6 for entering basic melee combat. I like the tradeoff of using my endurance to up my damage (either through spellcasting or melee) at the expense of reducing my ability to sprint away from the mob if I get in trouble. I like that mobs give up after a short while and will quickly move back to their 'camp' area if the mob can't catch me and that they won't spread agro on me to every bloody mob in an entire zone that they happen to pass even remotely close to. I also love the fact that I don't have to look at a bloody spellbook for over half my gaming time if I'm playing a caster. There are numerous other areas where I prefer DAoC over other products currently available.<br>
<br>
Is DAoC perfect? Hardly. Do I think DAoC is for everyone? No. It has it's little flaws as well as some larger flaws, but overall I much prefer DAoC to any other product that is on the market now.<br>

<br>
Nyssa- I'm not a big tradeskills person, i'm more about adventure, exploring, and customizing.  I thought i would try and pick it up in DAOC but its just not something i can really motivate myself to get into.  I thought EQ's trade skills were awful as well and alot of my reluctance to get into trade skills probably has to do with my experiences with foraging and tailoring(to complete that Velious quest) in EQ.  To be fair though, i havent given DAOC's trade skills system a chance but i really dont think thats what i'd enjoy.  <br>
<br>
To answer yours and Tudamorfs question about Quests comparison between DAOC and EQ, i'm sure i have less experience than the both of you have.  But i have done many kill tasks, as well as started my lvl 15 epic but said screw it after seeing the rewards.  I read the walkthrough though and it seemed to be equivalent to a regular quest in EQ, basically find people and kill things.  From my experiences so far with DAOC quests, they just seem to be shorter versions of EQ quests, which i have no problem with, EQ quests imo took way too long.  But i also believe EQ's quests are more rewarding in large part due to the way items are done in EQ as opposed to DAOC.  I guess it depends on why you do a quest.  I'm sure some people enjoy the storyline a quest might bring, but i only do quests if its worth doing in terms of a reward.  A big beef i have with DAOC is that items to me seem pointless, until i reach higher lvls.  I mean anything i acquire will have to be replaced in a few lvls anyways, so whats the point?  Its like i have gold, but what should i buy?  Theres nothing worth spending it on because gold is so hard to come by, and items come and go so fast since they green out as well as wear out.  I dont mind the wear out part, but to narrow the lifespan of what you acquire with both those factors imo is stupid.  It is exactly like AO in that respect.  At least the items arent as redundant as AO's though.  <br>
<br>
Well, to be honest i dont have many options.  I can go out and fight in the same outdoor areas and look forward to exp. only, or go back to a dungeon and go for items that will be pointless in a few lvls.  I can continue my lvl 15 epic, but its pointless to me since the item rewards arent that great imo and not worth it.  I cant play the market since there really is no player economy, and i'm wondering if there ever will be one.  I enjoy buying and selling for profit, its just that DAOC doesnt allow that yet although i was selling in dungeons but i'm not in dungeons anymore(everythings greened out in Mithra), and considering how customer specific an item i might wanna sell would be, not sure if it ever will.Realm combat again until i reach at least lvl 25-30, then i'll see how well it works then.  I've grouped often, but grouping has generally been just like soloing.  I cant put my finger on it exactly but exp hunting lacks something in DAOC that EQ had that made it less dull.  I guess its that feeling that something cool could drop like a spell or something that i could really use.  <br>
<br>
You guys have to realize that i force myself at times to log in and gain exp to reach a particular goal that i want to experience.  In EQ it was to finally go on dragon raids or haveuipment that would be fun to play with(like Lumi staff).  In DAOC its to participate in RvR, but not to be the victim 99% of the time because i'm so low in lvl.  So i NEED to lvl in order to be stronger in RvR, RvR is ALL about lvl, there isnt much skill to it when lvl disparity makes such a huge difference.  So i 'force' myself to login somedays just to knock out some exp to reach those ends, i'm sure many other people do as well.<br>
<br>
Tudamorf- I really wasnt complaining about DAOC's spells compared to EQ's.  I was curious since almost everything was carried over in some way, but fear type spells that i noticed. Dont get me wrong, i'm not complaining  that DAOC doesnt have unique spells to itself, since that'd be rediculous to expect imo.  Most things possible have been thought of already in some way by some previous game.  You can kinda call the mezz spells confusion type spells but i guess its arguable.<br>
<br>
EQ has more depth because its a more finished product.  The quests are deeper, although longer and much more of a pain in the ass.  There are many more NPC's that might mean something as well as more alternatives like a player economy.  More of a reason for items in EQ since customizing your equipment is definitely emphasized more.  Equipment also has a real value, not much value on stuff in DAOC.  Again, the bottom line is DAOC is still evolving in the same manner AO is trying to evolve, but to say they currently have more depth than EQ is silly imo.<br>
<br>
While i agree with you that the problem is me since other people dont apparently feel this way, but i beg to differ on the variety of options you listed.  You stated &quot;trade skills, you can do quests, you can enter realm combat&quot;.  I might look into what trade skills are all about in DAOC but i really doubt it will change the game for me.  How many quests are there?  I mean are there really that many other than my epic, kill tasks, and the find so and so?  As i stated RvR is all about lvl, and i refuse to participate anymore when i'm just gonna get waxed because i'm low in lvl for RvR.  I need to lvl in order to stand a chance in RvR.  EQ has other options btw, like customizing to fill your equipment slots, as well as making money buying and selling the extra stuff you acquire.  Both customizing and merchanting arent nearly as emphasized in DAOC as it is in EQ.  <br>
<br>
I didnt expect MaxPayne to be like an mmorpg, i knew when i bought it that it would be very action-oriented.  I'm just surprised at how well the game was done, and that it REALLY did live up to the enormeous hype which was surprising these days.  I'm not even trying to compare MaxPayne depth to DAOC depth, they are two different types of games, and imo an mmorpg will always have more depth than single players.  But to compare DAOC in its current state to the depth of other current mmorpg's, i believe DAOC lacks it with the exception of AO, but thats even debatable.  I dont blame them since its new, then again i'm not going to say it currently has a lwhole lot of depth as well.   <br>
<br>
As i've stated, i've already played just about every mmorpg thats been out.  I had a blast in UO, liked EQ, didnt like AC, hated AO, and not too fond of DAOC so far.  Maybe EQ has jaded me from anything EQ-like with that lvling treadmill format?  I dunno.  I know theres no way i'd go back to EQ, i've used it up.  So maybe that discontentment with EQ now carries over to DAOC because they are so alike.  I did enjoy DAOC in the beginning but that was moreout experiencing and learning a new world.  <br>
<br>
Macnat- camping also occurs in hot exp spots as well.  For example the lowest lvl room of Mithra Tomb was awesome exp for lvl 12-13'sh players in a full group.  The bad part is its only enough for one group.  There are other rooms that i didnt frequent down there that also were camped including some room with some big ogre or something that spawned.  But your right, there is less camping than EQ.<br>
<br>
Sauron- I neveromplained about the uniqueness of DAOC's spell system originally, i wanted to know why fear-type spells were excluded in the carryover.  I agree with you every spell pssible that might work well within a game has been done by another game at some point.  I'm not even complaining about DAOC's spell system, they did their best to make it unique, although there are many similarities, but i dont blame them.  <br>
<br>
For the record, i dont even want to bash DAOC that bad, its not terrible, but its not great either.  Its ok, but the fact that i played EQ to death probably makes more of an impact why i'm so bored with DAOC so quickly.  Also, the more i think about it, the more i hate the way the equipment system is done and it does make an impact in terms of the type of things i enjoy doing and looking forward to.  I'm sure DAOC will get more depth and more complete as a game.  Right now, i just dont see it....<br>

<br>
I mean as  TRUE newbie I started in cloth.  Then in a few levels I saved up for leather, then banded, then some bronze, etc....  I wish there HAD been quests I could do to get items useable at my level.  But there didnt' seem to be any.  <br>
<br>
So far the items I've gotten from my epic have been WONDERFUL.  Saved me a ton of cash.   I've gotten an incredible bow, a cloak that adds great stats (try to find a magic cloak OTHER than from questing) ;) my level 25 epic step gave me a great tunic upgrade that will last me a good long time. <br>
<br>
As for customization, I'm confused.  In EQ my bard, OMG she looks horrid. ;)  In DAoC I can customize my outfit to my little heart's content! heheh. <br>
<br>
I do quets for their rewards to.  Some I ened up with stuff I can't use, so I give ti to someone in the guild.  But most so far have been great stuff for me to use at the level I can do the quest.  I can't think of a single quest in EQ (pre Kunark and Velious since by that time it was a twink game 100%) that I could do at the level I should be using those items.  Even alot of the Lambent stuff was way out of reach around the level you'd expect to be doing those quests. <br>
<br>
I'm confused.  Aren't ALL MMORPG's leveling treadmills? It depends on your perspective.  I think it all comes down to perspective. If you look at leveling as a job you MUST do as fast as you can its not gonna be fun.  If you relax, enjoy and let it come its not a treadmill at all but a natural progression. <p>Silverleaf Goldenthorn<BR>

I didnt mean customizing in terms of looking different but thats my fault since i should've clarified.  I dont really care about looks until i get higher lvl like in EQ and have most of the stuff i want.  Theres no way i'm spending my life savings of 10gold on a dye that only dyes one piece of clothing.  That 10gold is as valuable to me as anything i have, if not more.  I scrounged like a pauper for that much gold.  I meant customizing more along the lines of emphasis on equipment and being proud of what you've acquired so far.  I mean if i finally get a cool piece of armour or a cool staff i want to be able to use it for awhile.  Not have to throw it away after a few lvls.  Basically, i just dont think DAOC puts much of an emphasis on equipment, most of its emphasis is on spec points as you lvl.  I'm not a big fan of that i guess.<br>

My lvl 15 epic requires me to go all over Albion searching for certain npc's and killing some things.  To me its not worth it when its gonna go green after a few lvls.  However the lvl 30 epic staff looks like its worth doing from what i've read on that so i might end up doing that if i make it that high.  <br>
<br>
Actually, not all mmorpgs are lvling treadmills.  UO wasnt but UO uses a skills system. kinda like specializing, but think more along the lines of specializing in skills where you can take points back by allowing those skills to detiorate.  Which is why i have so much praise for UO even though i hate OSI, because its different than the rest(EQ, AC, DAOC, AO).  In fact, I still dont understand why a 1st person mmorpg hasnt gone the UO-skills system route.  It would work great in a game that involves high lvl PvP, and it would dare to be different as well as set a new standard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukiatek2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiatek2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/29/01 2:57:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well</span><hr size=1> if you soloed to get those items you might have received them later than if you grouped to get them.  i was a in group and (at level 19) got a level 25 necklace.  I gave it a friend that could use it more (he was 22 or 23) but he can use that necklace probably til at least level 30.  so that is 7 or 8 levels.  then he can pass it down to someone else below him that its useful to.  now you may have been able to solo a purple (by several levels) but no way i can lol to get that necklace.   <br>
<br>
that isnt the only incident i have seen, so this a trend i have noticed in the game.  since you can tackle harder stuff with a group of ppl (typically), you have the potential to get higher level items that you can use longer.<br>
<br>
btw not saying this is true in every instance, just from the majority of my experiences. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ugoldmundtargari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goldmund TargaRi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/29/01 3:17:08 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ......</span><hr size=1> Hey Broom, I'm not gonna knock your opinions.  In fact I agree with a lot of what you have to say.  However, I think a lot of your frustration is a result of this being such a new game.  This can be frustrating for two reasons: one, there isn't an overwhelming amount of content available (EQ was exactly the same way at the beginning, possibly worse even); and two, you may not be aware of much of the content that IS available.<br>
<br>
Now stop me if I'm wrong, but it sounds from your posts that you play a friar in Albion.  If so, there are several quests that you should work on that result in very nice gear.  And despite how it may seem, equipment plays a VERY big role in the effectiveness of your character.  If you are using store bought weapons and armor, you are really shortchanging yourself.  A big oversight that people tend to make is neglecting the Quality stat on a piece of gear.  Quality directly impacts the AF on armor, and damage on weapons.  Store bought stuff maxes out at 85% qua, mob drops are 89%, player crafted is 90-99%, and quested pieces are usually 100%  So your lvl 15 quest leggings (assuming friar) are going to be better than anything else you could put in that slot for a good 5 levels (not to mention that I got nearly 6 bubs of exp from completing the quest).<br>
<br>
Other quests that yield great rewards:<br>
<br>
<a href=http://www.themonastery.net/quests3.html>Staff of Life</a><br>
<a href=http://www.themonastery.net/quests11.html>Siom's Staff</a><br>

<a href=http://daoc.warcry.com/quests/detail_quest.php?quest=39>Hunt for Arachneida</a><br>
<br>
I'm hard pressed to think of even one quest in EQ that yields a decent piece of gear for someone 15 and under.<br>
<br>
In an earlier post you mentioned Mithra being good exp at 12-13.  I'd actually argue that you should head to Mithra at 6-7 and leave at 11-12.  If you'd gotten your armor at a lower level (when it was still orange-yellow) you would get MUCH more use out of it.  At level 15 you should start hunting for Bloodied Leather armor (drops from welsh hobgoblins in Llyn Barfog and undead romans in Cornwall) which will last you until level 25 or so.<br>
<br>
Also, I wouldn't sweat only having 10gp at level 15.  I can make 10gp hunting in an evening now at 23 (in a good group, not a chance solo).  However if you want to accumulate some wealth, you simply must pick up a tradeskill.  I had well over 100gp at level 15 from my work in tailoring.  <br>
<br>
Well I've rambled enough here, but hopefully I've given you a few alternatives to the kill loot kill loot monotony. <p><img src=http://www.alltel.net/~mr81645/godzillasigDAoC.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/30/01 3:21:06 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/lynxhead.jpg WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What happened to fear spells?  Camping?</span><hr size=1> Well first off, Broomhilda.  Games should never be something you need to motivate yourself to get into.  Why are you doing that to yourself?  I mean, motivate yourself to get up in the morning to go to work, motivate yourself to go exercise instead of vegging out on the couch, but motivating yourself to play a game?  Something doesn't sound right here.  You shouldn't have to force yourself to do something that should be naturally enjoyable and pleasurable.<br>
<br>
Fine, you don't like tradeskills, fine, you don't like lvling, fine, you don't like camping, but have you ever sat down and thought, &quot;hmm that's what ALL MMORPGs are about.  If I don't like those things, maybe MMORPGs aren't right for me?&quot;  I mean, is someone making you play these games that you so blatantly don't like?  <br>
<br>
I don't really know a MMORPG that doesn't require you to gain experience and lvl before you can advance to the greater features in the game.  If you think about it, games kinda reflect real life.  At low lvls you must kill mobs and gain experience, much like going to school.  Then when you're experienced and wise enough you can engage in tougher mobs, and fight against other people.  IE: the real world and work.  You can't be successful in the working world without an education ya know.  And think of tradeskills as if they were like sports back in school.  They're a form of distraction away from the every day grind.<br>
<br>
If you really want to play a game, then why don't you look into games that has what you like.  Play a Playstation or a Nintendo game.  Last I recall, games from the Legend of Zelda series don't require lvling, and don't have tradeskills, yet they allow you to adventure and explore the land.<br>
<br>
By the way you're sounding, I honestly think you're wasting your time investing in MMORPGs. <p><CENTER>

When i hit about 13 i solo'd more often in there.  Just so you know i did get like 2 or 3 yellow items including my staff thats still blue right now., but the majority of everything i have from Mithra is green.  I see what your saying though with going for purples or higher con mobs.<br>
<br>
Goldmund- Sorry, but i play a Theurg (.  I agree that alot of my problems have to do with it being so new, i'm also judging it now tho.  Hehe, i dunno about your recommended lvls for Mithra, whew.  A lvl 6-7 in there might get torn up, but if he sticks near the entrance with a group then he should be ok.  Just so you know tho, the bottom lvl where the named centurion skeletons spawn(Annilus and others), everything in that room is blue or higher at lvl 15, and sometimes the named are orange.  The bad thing is the hall mobs right outside that room(where i used to solo when the room was taken) greened out when i turned 15, and the room was always taken, so i took off abit after the beginning of 15.  Also, you shouldnt be soloing down there unless your at least lvl 12 imo, but it depends on yoru class i guess.  You can solo in other areas much earlier tho.  <br>
I wish i could wear leather, i'd be at Llyn Barfog next time i'm on, but its only crappy cloth for me.  Wow, i didnt know tradeskills were that lucrative.  Hmmm...<br>
<br>
Nyssa- Well, to be honest i dunno how the lvling treadmill can really be that enjoyable everytime you log on.  For example in EQ, most of us hit that treadmill pretty often to hit lvl 50.  Not even pretty often, but way too often, and its just hard for me to believe that CAN be enjoyable each and everytime you log on.  I mean it had its moments where i was immersed, but after so much of it, it becomes more of a goal than just fun.  The first couple times i killed Cobalt Drakes was fun, but after so many times it became a chore just for exp.  I realize that mmorpg's do require some work(not fun), but like i stated, when i burn out i enjoy doing other things that DAOC just doesnt offer right now.  <br>
<br>
Just so you know Nyssa not all MMORPG's are lvling treadmills, UO isnt.  I loved UO, and i liked EQ so i know what a mmorpg is about, its just that i guess the EQ -treadmill has wore me out.  In fact, i'm curious how many more mmorpg's will utilize the same EQ-treadmill and how long the customer base will be happy with that same system.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unyssarainwhisper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyssa Rainwhisper</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bluepawbullet.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(11/30/01 8:12:07 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/DAoC/lynxhead.jpg WIDTH=115 HEIGHT=116></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .......</span><hr size=1> Well Broomhilda, the lvling &quot;treadmill&quot; doesn't bore me because I don't look at it like it's work for me. I don't log on with the intentions of killing, lvling, looting, and being uber, no. I log on to enjoy the company of the friends I've made while enjoying a game. I log on, see which of my friends are on and see what they're up to and if they need help with anything. And if they're not on, and I really feel like playing, then I occupy myself by doing a trade skill or two. Otherwise I play fetch with my dogs or curl up with a good book.<br>
<br>
Sure the monotony of EQ bored me, hence why I don't like soloing or out lvling my friends. I never played UO, so I can't speak for it, but from the MMORPGs I've played (EQ, AO, DAoC), yeah, it's pretty much all about lvling unless you explore your other options, which in DAoC, in my opinion, there are plenty of options. <br>
<br>
Quite frankly, when I started playing DAoC during their final stages of beta, I didn't think much of it.  I thought it was way too much like EQ.  At the time I was completely ready to give up on MMORPGs after dealing with uber d00ds, and people bickering over loot, mobs, camps, and epics.  It put a taste in my mouth more sour than a raw lemon.  But eventually when DAoC was released, I gave it a shot, and even though I still wasn't really impressed with it, I later found out that a lot of the friends I made in EQ were moving over as well and I hooked up with them and had a blast!  As time passed, I discovered other options to the lvling routine I was so accustomed to in EQ and I can truly say I enjoy DAoC now.  Otherwise I wouldn't be paying what is it? 12 bucks a month for it?  Hell, I'd rather buy my dog an extra bag of rawhides with that money if I didn't enjoy the game.<br>
<br>
I never doubted that you know what a MMORPG is about. I'm merely saying that if you don't like a game and you're forcing yourself to log on and enjoy it, why are you playing it? You're wasting time and money when there are plenty of other things to do. I feel the frustration you must be going through just by reading your posts and honestly, I couldn't do what you're doing. I would never pay to play a game I don't enjoy. Hence why I don't play EQ anymore. Now don't get me wrong and think that I'm trying to kick you out of DAoC. I honestly don't want you to have to force yourself to like a game. No one should have to. <p><CENTER>
