Thank you.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Quotes from another <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=27871.topic">thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->:<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Nobody (read: Not druids nor wizards) should have gotten teleporting abilities from the start.<br><br>It was a very poor decision By Verant to give teleport abilities to players<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>Do people seriously think like this? Have I just been totally oblivious to people's feelings towards port abilities? I have always been under the impression that people in general LIKED that there were classes that could teleport/translocate. Hi, 20 minute boats rides. Hi, 30 minute hikes. Hi, 15 min wait on Nexus and THEN a 30 minute hike.<br><br>When I made my druid, I was such a noob, I didn't even realize that I would get group porting abilities. So obviously that is NOT why I chose this toon, it is NOT why I love this toon more than all my others. <br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For all the druids that will happily give strangers ports all day long, there are more that will either overcharge for the service, or outright deny it at their own whim. Same is true for wizards. The resentment created by druids/wizards that wouldnt port another player for a legitimate reason (i.e. I dont feel like it sorry)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>This is very possibly the most naive, immature, ludicrous, and out and out STUPID thing I have ever read on this board. Let me lay this scenario out for you.<br><br>I am in Thurgadin.<br>I am working on a quest for myself there.<br>RandomNonPortingGimp_01 tells you, 'WC plz'<br><br>Heh. I suppose I have 4 options here:<br>1. Ignore this.<br>2. /reply STFU, no.<br>3. /reply I'm sorry, I'm rather busy at this time.<br>4. Port yer sorry self, and SoW you upon landing.<br>Typically, I go with option 3. Because contrary to popular belief, I am not a total @#%$. <br><br>Plain and simple, the author of the above quote is an extraordinary imbecile. If I don't want to port you, brainbox, simply because I don't feel like it.. umm, that is my choice. If I want to charge you 300pp to go to EJ for a Sev mobilization that you are SO LATE to.. umm, that is my choice. Supply and demand baby. Ever study econ? It is MY ability, I have to drop what I am doing, port MYSELF out, along with you, to whatever zone you MUST get to ASAP. If I wanna jack the prices for a port, if I want to say NO to you at a whim, it's my perogative. Deal with it, find another port, or pray to your chosen diety that you have the stamina to run from point A to point B. Do you really think that you deserve an explanation for why I won't port you? And do you really think that if I don't have a reason that you deem worthy, than by some rule in your twisted brain, I must port you? Go ahead, resent me. <br><br>Now, look at mages, chanters, clerics, paladins, shamans, hell, even necros. Should I get pissed and cry and whine and bitch if:<br>Mage won't make me focus items or trod cause they just don't feel like it?<br>Chanter won't KEI me cause they just don't feel like it?<br>Cleric won't Marzin, Rez, or Aego me cause they just don't feel like it?<br>Paladin won't AC buff me cause they just don't feel like it?<br>Shaman won't rit health, stamina, focus, or whatever me cause they just don't feel like it?<br>Necro won't DMF or twitch me cause they just don't feel like it?<br><br>Should those spells be taken away from them because they just aren't in the mood to cast it on every damn person that walks by? Should we all be up in arms at Verant crying and saying they should never have gotten the ability to cast these spells for the simple reason that YOU can't be polite, articulate, or contributing when asking for something from someone?<br><br>Here's something I do.<br>Maybe you all don't, but hell, it works.<br>If I want KEI..<br>/w enc all<br>scan list and find someone who is NOT in a place like Ssra.<br>/tell RandomChanter 200plat for C3?<br><br>Chanter will do it. Chanter will be HAPPY to do it. You may have to go to them, but regardless. (You will always find ones that will just not answer you.. I like to think they're AFK, and not ignoring me, but I'm probably delusional there) Sure, 200plat is high for a single cast. But it's worth it, it gets you what you want, when you want it. Additionally, Chanter will be happy to do it for you again, next time you ask. And they probably will even decline your trade. I can't count how many Chanters have told me.. 'Kildy, you pay to much, keep your plats this time, and next time is on me as well'. <br><br>So in line with that theory..<br>You need a port?<br>/w 39 50 dru all<br>again find one that is NOT in a fighting zone, look for those in WC.. etc.<br>/tell RandomDru SomePlat for pickup and port to someplace?<br><br>Note: WC plz, GD plz, Port to GD, or simply walking up to me, hailing me, and saying &quot;WC&quot;, will get you no where, other than a glimpse of my /rude emote as I port myself out to get away from you.<br><br>Lastly, be creative. Be articulate. We are not like the soulbinders, scions, or the new translocators at the docks that you can boss around. My favorite request for a port to date? <br>In Thurg, making pottery thingys.<br>DwarfWarrior tells you, 'Hello, happen to have time for a port to WL?'<br>You tell DwarfWarrior, 'Sorry hun, I can't, I'm working to fill orders on pottery items people asked for ages ago. Good luck.'<br>DwarfWarrior tells you, 'Please, Fair Lady, I am in dire need of a port. In exchange, a beautiful flower for a beautiful lady, and some coins to aid you in your pottery attempts.'<br>Next thing I know, a trade window popped up.<br>10plat, and a Rose of Firiona.<br>Dwarf got his port to WL, not because of the plat (I would have still said no to cash only), but simply because he made me laugh.<br> <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=136857><font size="-5" face="Tahoma" color=#333399>Baroness Kildaere Li'Siofra</a><br>Hierophant<br><a href=http://www.guardiansofvalour.com>Guardians of Valour</a><font size="-8" face="Tahoma" color=#333399><br>Tholuxe Paells</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usobesilvertree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sobe Silvertree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/19/02 9:14:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uoldoaktree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oldoaktree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Finally Housebroken!</span><br>  Posts: 307<br> <font color=#333399>(7/19/02 5:09:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=713.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Good rant</span><hr size=1> Very well said.<br><br>I have to say that guys post really pissed me off too.<br><br>Somewhere along the line people got the impression that druids are like soulbinders.

Even then I didn't do it as a business...but you know what?  Every time I see the taxi drivers come through (&quot;porting to all druid rings ...

Because I don't want people stranded...but I also don't want to spend my entire game session running around moving people just because they tell me to.<br><br>I port a lot for my guild and happily.  But we are all entitled to time to do whatever the hell we feel like, even if we are just chatting with friends and sitting on our butts.  No one has the right to demand anything.<br><br>I have gone to specialists when I have needed them...a necro for a summon, a cleric for a rez, a chanter for a brain buff.  If needed, I will fetch them, pay them, and put them back when I am done with them.  And I am damn polite about asking.  I also take the time to figure out if they look like maybe they might be available (in WC, in bazaar, or some other place where people drift when at loose ends).<br><br>I can't count the number of times I have seen some druid getting tongue lashed because people seem to think we are the civil service of Norath.<br><br>We are helpful people.  We do move people for that CR.
