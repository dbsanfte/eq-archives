Or atleast just start with everything thats on a rotation, cause we know how it will turn out anyway.<br>
<br>
We already know that Vox and Nagafen lists are stupid since most people on it can not even participate.<br>
<br>
Trakanon on a rotation is fully denying some people the right to make a key for a whole zone in the game. Within the last 14 days I have seen the key part that trakanon drop and that so many so desperately want /auctioned in sebilis.<br>
<br>
If people want Trakanon for the BP then they can take a white and red dragon scale and make the peice for bard epic that can spawn trakanon out of the undead bard. It drops a BP every time.<br>
<br>
But seriously I wouldnt give a damn about the spawn if it wasnt cause it gave keys to a zone that most would like to see. As the list is going now it will soon be a 12 month long list for any guild that want to try and collect theese keys for the zone.<br>
<br>
Even more VP doesnt just have to be about dragons, its high lvl roamer spawns that drops 59+ kunark spells that most would like aswell.<br>
<br>
I know juggs almost does the same but not quite in the same way.<br>

Its not like the teeth are rotting, the people on the raids get the teeth.  All it is doing is denying you personally the chance to get the teeth with the alcarity you desire.  I'm sorry, but everquest doesnt offer enough resources for everyone to get what they want when the want it, and that means you have to share.  Your arguement seems very selfish to me Lanos.  You are saying that rather than sharing and giving everyone a chance to get what they want, you want to be able to cut in line and take their share so you can get what you want for yourself faster.  As for the suggestion that people wanting trak bp's should just get some scales and use the bard, that is selfish in the the exterme.  Those scales are not easy to get at all, and I seriously hope they are all going to help bards and warriors get their epic weapons.  Suggesting that scales should be taken away from bards and warriors so that you can get your vp key faster is just plain selfish.  The trak rotation is fair.  It might be long, it might not be the most benificial to any one person, but it is th emost fair way to distribute streched resources. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udelsonorablackthorne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delsonora Blackthorne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=#FFFF66>Brell Board Administrator <img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/goldstartr.gif align=middle><br>NWN Board Administrator</font></span><br>  Posts: 2289<br> <font color=#CC9900>(6/5/01 9:29:19 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.brellserilis.net/images/rotmsig.gif width=90 height=110></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Delsonora...come on man im begging here..</span><hr size=1> Lanos,<br>
<br>
We have been friends for awhile. You have taken a stance that the calendar is no longer something you guys are going to observe (atleast for Fire Giants). I can't say i blame you, and i definetly don't think any less of you for having that view. You have made a difficult decision as a guild leader for the betterment of your guild and I can respect that.<br>
<br>
Do i think the calendar system is broken? Absolutely. Do i want Fire Giants reserved? No. Do I want independants on the rotations? No. Do i think that the Vox and Nag lists are getting just as bad as Venril? Yes.<br>
<br>
Am i going to take the fall and play bad guy again so that guilds who no longer want to respect reservations can avoid criticism?<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
The community has made its choices. It chose (by a very slim margin) to make Fire Giants reservable, despite our warnings that we could not enforce it, nor could we stop people who wanted Ragefire from walking over reservations. The community so far has chosen to give independants the same access to the rotations as full guilds of people. <br>
<br>
I think these choices are very poor. However, it is their choice to make. We stepped in and killed the Venril list without gaining concensus. Should that have been handled differently? Absolutely. Did I take a lot of @#%$ for being the &quot;bad guy&quot;. Hell yes. Was it the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  right decision?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I think it was.<br>
<br>
The calendar is voluntary. It only works when people participate. I have warned all along that unless people started to make concessions to guilds who have been held back to an extent by the reservation system, that slowly but surely people would stop using it. Thats <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> choice to make.<br>
<br>
There is no doubt in my mind, that everyone who voted for Fire Giants to be reserved, or to have indies on the rotations did so thinking that it was the best choice. However, you have to look at the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  big picture</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sometimes and what the future holds. Some times you need to give a little, to receive something in return. Whats been happening too often around here is that people take without giving back. People are taking every loophole or exploit in the calendar to bend it to their advantage.<br>
<br>
So, we are NOT going to walk in and kill the calendar. Frankly we don't need to because in all honesty, the community is killing it all by itself. <br>

I also think that Clerics are able to and should contact any schedualed FG raid leader if RageFire does pop close to a schedualed FG raid time. Things can be worked out in game so all end up winners.<br>
<br>
As far as Track is concerned, well, I really do not know. How does that key work? Does it take a whole group up like the ToFS keys?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I also agree that saying to take away two Epic Items for something other than an Epic Weapon is a bit selfish. I keep teasing my Guild Leader that I want a Red Dragon Scale for a BP. Awhile ago I conceaded to him that there are better BP's out there and the better use for the scale is for Epics.<br>
<br>
 I am truely sorry that not everyone can get what they want when they want it, but as the Druids say &quot;Save a Tree.&quot; Life is like that. You can't always have what you want, but if your try some time, you might just find, you can always get what you need. People need to learn how to seperate those two, too, wants and needs. No ever needs to go to any zone in Norrath. If you want to do your Epic, you need to go into differant zones but then no one needs to ever do their Epic.<br>
<br>
One day, when I am Uberer, I want to kill Trak. Why? Not for a key or any other loot. I want to kill him because he is a Dragon, by Brells Beard! If I win a roll on something, then I will raise a Toast to Brell. If I don't, who cares? I had fun. That is what this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  game </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is supossed to be about, having fun. There are alot of places to have fun at.

<br>
How can me being angry that some people are /auction items that in our guild are seen as holy ever be about greed. You might only play this game some 10 hours a week but some of us spend a bit more time here cause we would like to do some other things than run around dreaming about a red scale BP.<br>
<br>
Ever tried telling a professional sportsman to relax cause its just a game? Your thoughts fit well for everything being Fcfs aswell. Its just if things was Fcfs then every person would have a say in what was most important to them and concentrate on that.<br>

I do feel sorry for anyone who came after SR trying to get their guild into Veeshan's peak.  We had the spawn to ourselves for 7-8 spawns then rotated with LoH for about that many spawns until anyone else joined the rotation.

I guess I just don't get you at all, it must be the different thinking between Euro and the US. As I understand it you don't like the way things are done. You don't want to work with in the system because it makes you stay up late and/or get up early to do something, and as you state you have a job. I guess this only really effects you since those of us that also work and make the sleep sacrafice to do the &quot;cool&quot; things don't count. To be totally honest I don't see FCFS fixing this for you because if the server goes that way some guild will decide they want to be the next FoH, and start clearing everything. So none of us will get to do the &quot;cool&quot; stuff.<br>
<br>
Yes the rotation lists are a pain, Yes it keeps others from doing everything they want to do, and yes sometimes it's not fair to everyone, but isn't that the on going challenge of life?<br>
Also VI stated long ago not everyone will have or get to do everything in the game. <br>

Oh and before you blow me off with your normal once you reach 60 then talk to me speech because you don't count in Lanos' eyes until then. I've played for 2 years and have a 120+ played days in this PC. So I really feel like I've put in the time to have an opinion.<br>

Yes, this means, by definition, that those with the most power have to give some up for those with the least. We then go with what the majority of the Brell player base agrees to (or the majority of those that care).<br>
<br>
In this way Brell is the most Democratic Server in EQ.<br>
<br>
No system is perfect. All seem to fall toward the &quot;far from perfect&quot; side of things. <br>
<br>
Most servers have no reservation system. Alot of people stay on Brell or even move here because we do. Many of these people give up 50's or even 60's charactors and all their goodies to make the move. They come to Brell as an uber rare spawn True-Newbie in all but skill of play.<br>
<br>
I say that we should keep our uniqueness that the Reservation System has solidified and have fun, imperfections and all. If this that makes us unique detests someone so much then they can quit the server and move to one of the dozens that are FFA. There is nothing keeping you and your friends here except for the Uber Loot you have acquired. Being 60 you have reached the apex of your leveling and skill potential. If the Reservation System that serves the majority of the less leveled so well in aquiring said uber-loot is a hinderance to your own greed, then move on to a place where that hinderance does not exist.<br>
<br>
Right now many minds are working hard to figure out ways to aide the Minority Asian/Europians to do Planer Raids. Many of us most outspoken (some even respected and considered Leaders) citizens in the community are showing our willingness to compromise to make the system better. The reason why we are doing this is because we see that it has it's short-falls but at the same time are commited to the ideal behind it.<br>
<br>
One person on this board continues to chant a litany of the reservation's demise. However, he continues to work with in the reservation system and tries to compromise with others so it remains in tact. I will not mention his name but he knows I am talking about him.<br>
<br>
If you do not want to aide in trying to make the system better but only want to distroy that that makes Brell unique, then ** edit ** it is most unfortunate. ** edit **<br>
<br>
<br>
MOD Note...editted slightly to take the bristled edge off it.  Please keep these discussions civil.<br>

Lanos, that may be the solution to your current situation.  If you have spare BPs, perhaps you can trade them to raiders for looting rights to teeth? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uinkiecharmer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>InkieCharmer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/24/01 4:09:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Delsonora...come on man im begging here..</span><hr size=1> Coming from a smaller guild and one that focuses more on family and roleplaying, I guess I have to take Krungle's side in this.  Not because our guild will ever be able to take out something as grand as Trak (but hey, we can dream!)  Many of our guild members go to other massive guilds in hopes that we can win a roll on that epic piece or that we get let into the raid at all.  I have no problem with that.  My journey will be a harder one, but it also forces me to get out there and make allies and get to know more people in the Brell community.  <br>
<br>
Yah, no system is perfect, but there are always alternatives.  A schedule is messy and FCFS will only benefit the huge guilds who can gather up the forces necessary in a small amount of time.  Either way, it's a pain.  I guess you just have to see which is the lesser of the two evils.  That answer for me is honor.  Brell is an honorable server and I find that we still have the reservation system somewhat in tact a good thing.  I am PROUD of that and proud to be on a server that is looked to by others as a good example.  <br>
<br>
I mean, if reservation systems stop being honored just for the heck of it, I imagine the guild or individuals involved will only further damage their reputation.  Kinda the whole: &quot;give em enough rope and they'll hang themselves&quot; saying.  If it's important to them to be first in line for everything and have first dibs on all, then I don't imagine the experience is as enriching for them and they may move along to another game sooner than later.  Whereas, working with friends and comrades and making allies along the way.... somehow... that makes achieving a task as great as (let's say an epic) even more rewarding.  <br>
<br>
Like I said, there is never gonna be a system that pleases everyone, but maybe more options need to be addressed?  Give and take kinda thing.  Maybe 50% of the time an area can be free for all and 50% of the time it's scheduled.  Kinda like going to a gym and having from noon to 6pm an open gym where you do what ya want... but at 6pm and through until 10 pm, it's classes as scheduled.  Can the same FEASIBLY be done for these?  (depending on the rotation timeframe of course.)  Just an idea, don't throw rotten vegetables at me just yet!  Thinking aloud more than anything. <br>
<br>
Anyway, my final thoughts on this are.... to thine ownself be true.  If you are a person of honor, then do right by the rest of the server - why go out of your way to ruin another's fun?  If you aren't... then make your own dinner, but prepare to eat it all.. whether it is feast or famine...<br>

The same people will kill trak now as they were before.  The people that are willing to commit more time into getting him will get him more often.<br>
<br>
The dragons in Velious that drop the Sleeper's talismen are quite similar to Trak (They drop items &amp; a needed key piece) but they're working fine under FCFS.<br>
<br>
If the names on the current trak list are a legitimate representation of the people who want to kill trak, then it won't change much.  Trak might die a little sooner than he does now, or he might stay up for days because nobody cares about him.<br>
<br>
Either way, it won't mean a doomsday for Brell. <p><img src="http://members.home.net/adun-darkguard/sadunef.jpg" width="381" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ulanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=BEBEBE>Lanos the Luminary</font><br><font color=red>Brell BoTB Winner</font></span><br>  Posts: 444<br> <font color=#CC9900>(7/24/01 6:29:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.snap.com/edit/raw/rawimage/79/989779.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=120?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Delsonora...come on man im begging here..</span><hr size=1> ya they are working fine if your in SR and Watchers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But I agree with Adune people that want it the most will spend the time camping it. <br>
<br>
Personally i think Verant screwed up a bit when they made the sleeper's key dragons. I can think of about 3 of them that are close to unkillable without weapons from sleepers or a big old zerg rush.<br>
<br>
So that leave maybe 2 up for grabs. Thats gonna be one big ass problem in the future unless luclin take the attention before it gets there. <br>
<br>
I guess its Verant's idea of making sure some content of the Game are only for the 1 or 2 Uber guild that each server have. I doubt there will be enough keys for anyone else, unless they nerf the last 3 dragons at some point.<br>
<br>
This is no whine in anyway against brell or our system just a statement of how it is on all servers right now. To answer Adune's post on the sleeper keys.<br>
