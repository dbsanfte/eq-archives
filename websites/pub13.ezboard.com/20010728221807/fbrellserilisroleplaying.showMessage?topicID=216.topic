<br>
She always comes to me in my dreams. I do not know her name. I have come to know her simply as the Dark Maiden. She always appears to me as a Tier’dal female covered only by her flowing silver hair. She usually stands upon a small hillock with the full moon behind her. Rays of moonlight fall upon this being causing her skin to glow in a silvery radiance. The animals of the forest can always be seen not to far from her apparently caught in the same spell that holds me in rapt attention. It is then that I notice she is singing, her song flows with the cool breeze in harmony with the night sounds and the wind in the trees. Her song beckons me, it tells me to step out of the shadows that I just notice I’m drenched in. I cannot move and with that inability her song takes on another note. I am now filled with sorrow for I will not get to join in song with her under the light the stars that form a surreal canopy above her. She turns to me her arms outstretched begging me to step out of the darkness that is suffocating me. I want to go to her but I do not, sorrow is etched on her face. She begins to dance, her tall lithe form moving with unearthly grace. I can tell this is a dance for two and that my voice would bring a harmony to hers. Her songs pace picks up as does her dance, almost to a frenzied pace as her song and dance reach a crescendo she becomes translucent until all that is left is a single shaft of moon light and her haunting voice left on the wind. I am left in the darkness alone, always alone.<br>

OOC: And the follow up<br>
<br>
Just as it had every night for the last month my dream of the Dark Maiden returned to me. Just as every night before I felt a tug on my soul as the Maiden began her ethereal song and to my disappointment yet again I remained shrouded in that I alone brought to this sacred place. Yet again I could not leave behind my heritage that the shadows represented. Yet tonight was somehow different, her song seemed to carry a sense of urgency that was not there before, just as before she turns to me offering me a place beside her in the dance I know is to come. Tonight just as ever night before I do not come to her but tonight instead of sorrow, fear is etched on her face. Fear for my well being for she sees that which I cannot. Her concern strikes me to the very core of my being. Her concern motivates me, as I have never been before, I take the first step one that will surely lead to more. Just as my bare blue foot pierces the veil of shadows that is engulfing me I am deafened by a voice that I have heard my entire life.<br>
<br>
“YOU ARE MINE,” boomed throughout the glade. I felt my warm blood trickle down my neck from my ruptured eardrums. A giant hand flew from within the shadows, the hand of my Father. He viciously ripped me away from the glen and the Maiden. The last thing I saw before I was over come with unconsciousness was a single tear slide down her unmarred face, a tear for me. <br>
<br>
I awoke what must have been several days later, dried blood matting my hair to my face, the Dark Father’s voice throbbing within my mind reminding me with each painful throb that my soul belongs to him. I see the Maidens face in my minds eye with the single shed tear and my head throbs all the more violently…<br>
<br>
To be continued...<br>
<br>
It had been several weeks since I had dreamt of the Dark Maiden. The night Innoruuk made his presence known and felt in both the dream world and the real world was the last of the dreams. At least the throbbing had finally ceased. For the first few days after the dream I would hear Innoruuk’s harsh voice reminding me that I was his, that I was but the property of the god of hate. That had ceased also, sleep had only brought oblivion. I was both thankful and saddened by this. The constant reminder from Innoruuk that I had no free will had nearly left me insane, which reminded me of the “prophet” Pravdameer. In my younger days I would have left a whelp with the gall to talk to me in such a manner a broken man or sacrificed him for his impudence, but I had done nothing. I didn’t care what he or anyone thought of neither me nor my devotion to Innoruuk. I was more concerned and felt more at the loss of my dreams of the Maiden. Perhaps it was my lack of conviction with Innoruuk or a strengthening of the Maiden that heralded the return of the dream last night.<br>
<br>
Just as every dream of the Maiden I had before she stood alone upon a hillock in the center of a moonlit glade. She was nude, partially covered by her long lustrous silver hair. A shaft of moonlight frames her on the hillock causing her skin to shimmer in the soft light. She raises her voice in song, a soft melody that the stars above seem to glimmer in response to. Just as every dream before her song comes to a point that I know requires another singer. I am not surprised to hear my voice join hers in perfect harmony not only with her but the night itself. In the back of my mind I can hear Innoruuk roar in protest, I am unafraid for his grip upon me is broken forever. My spirit soars with this realization and I step out of the morass of shadows that had engulfed me. I notice that I am nude, though I am unashamed all is as it should be. I reach the base of the hillock just as she turns towards me, I realize now that in my previous dreams she wasn’t beckoning be but offering her hands to me. I take her hands in mine and she helps me up onto the small hill. I am drenched in the rays of the moon. My voice still raised up in song with the Maiden. She looks down on me a smile of love on her face. She is easily a foot taller than I am, with an unearthly beauty that was only hinted at from the distance. In the corner of my eye I see the shadows take on a malevolence I did not know was there. They writhed and whipped about in a maelstrom of activity until they coalesced into the form of the Dark Father Innoruuk. I can see him screaming in impudent fury yet his voice cannot piece the purity of our song. I ignore him for the time of the dance has arrived. The Maiden takes the lead, my hands still entwined with hers. It is as though I have known the dance my entire life for I do not miss a step but move in perfect unity with the Maiden. I am amazed that I do not feel out of place next to the Maidens supernatural grace. The dance and song pick up pace, droplets of sweat form on our bare bodies the moons light causes them to glisten on our rapidly twirling forms. The dance takes on an impossible speed, I feel lighter than the crisp air around me. I notice that I am no longer solid but have taken on an ethereal form. The goddess and I become one a being made of pure moonlight. As I travel up the shaft of light my path and future are laid out before me. I know now that Innoruuk has no hold upon me. Nor will he ever, I also know that I am the Dark Maidens first follower and it is my job to spread her message. All that lives within the night is under my protection. I know that my strength will be the strongest under a star filled sky by the light of the full moon. I know that my path will be a difficult one, but I accept it.<br>
<br>
I awoke that morning refreshed, as I had never been before. I quietly got out of bed being careful not to wake up the softly snoring Oifur and silently padded over to my divan. I noticed a few things as I looked at myself on the polished surface of the looking glass. First the lines that had marred my face from my perpetual scowl were gone, making me appear several years younger. And secondly my hair, a normal lustrous white had taken on a silver hue. I also knew it was time for me to leave Neriak for good, I could no longer live in the confines of a dank cavern. Perhaps Lokus and Katera could use a neighbor on Lake Rathe, the nights there were wondrous with the stars and moon reflected by the great lake. I have no fear that the leadership of the Spires will find out that I am no longer a tool of Innoruuk for there are very few true priest or priestesses within those halls and those that I suspect hear Innoruuk’s voice are mad or have ostracized them selves from the political power base of the Spires. I will be careful in the spreading of the Maidens message for my and those I call friends protection.<br>
