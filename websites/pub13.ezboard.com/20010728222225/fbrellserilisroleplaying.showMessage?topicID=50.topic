I searched the night sky for signs of morning. With a heavy heart I realized the night was still young. How far had I ran? It mattered not at the moment, my persuer was tracking me still. I flung my backpack somewhere into the mud and continued, the incessant rain had made it a burden too much to bear. On and on I ran, my footprints leaving my enemy a tell tale trail to follow. I remember being tired then, and knew the end would be soon. On I ran still, my fear the only thing keeping me on my feet. Crossing a small hillock my foot caught in an exposed root and I collapsed in a heap to the ground. Lightning flashed and the moon was gone, was it that close to dawn? A sliver of hope entered my heart then. In utter darkness I prayed silently to Tunare for the end of this nightmare to be soon. I tried to pull myself to my feet, and failed. Silent I laid there, gathering my resolution to at least meet my end standing on my own two feet.<br>
<br>
A massive claw gripped me by the shoulder, and with one arm this beast set me upon my feet. Terror gripped me. This was not my tracker! I cautiosly looked upon the face of my certain death and realized his massive body must have been what blocked out the moon. His thick and scaled green hide was covered with plates of blue armor and dripped the ichor of countless beings. In his other hand he carried a cruel shaped axe, made for inflicting pain as much as it was for the slaughter. Our eyes met, mine widening in fear, his narrowing in cruel scrutiny. Those purple orbs shone with a dull light from underneath his spiked helm. Did he smile? He loosed the grip on my shoulder and smelled the air. What he possibly could have smelled or heard through the thunderstorm I cannot comprehend.<br>
<br>
He gave me a small nudge and released his hold on me. &quot;Ghro&quot; He said gruffly and pointed in<br>
the direction of the Free Port. My feet would not move, never before had I felt such fear. With small effort he embedded the cruel looking axe in a nearby tree and began fussing in one of the several packs he carried. In short order he produced two more axes of a smaller variety. He was getting ready for battle? Flinging his packs aside he began to sharpen a silvery axe that glimmered coldly in the moonlight. He smiled then, slightly, as if this<br>
was some small and warm comfort to him in the world that treated him coldly. I turned to run<br>
and found myself face to face with the skeletal servant of my tracker.<br>
<br>
I reached for my weapon at the same time I realized I had lost it on the trail somewhere. A skeletal hand smashed into my body, knocking me to the ground, I thought I heard the sound of cold laughter behind me, but it was cut short by an earth shattering roar. It seemed a troll had a lust for battle.<br>
<br>
A harsh word was spoken in Tier'Dal and the skeletal attacker halted. Hissing a response to it's master it remained to stand above me as I sat there, in utter disbelief of the situation. The necromancer strode from the cover of the swamp to stand in front of the frenzied troll. Taking a firm and confident stance in front of the troll the two regarded eachother quietly for several moments.<br>
<br>
They spoke in common then.<br>
<br>
&quot;You must leave me to do my work. How dare you interfere with the wishes of Neriak? You may rest assured I will report your insolence to the proper authorities there. Should you ever show your face there again, you will be killed on sight. Now leave me beast, do not try to interfere or I shall slay you as well. In the Father's name it shall be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huar!&quot; The troll bellowed back. &quot;Yu tink yer so smart. Dis da swamp. Dis not naughtie elfie town. TROLLS rule da swamp, me sez yer no welcum heer!&quot; A light of seething, primal anger flashed across his face. &quot;Jus cuz yus kin use da majik yus tink ya kin boss trolls round. Not no mor, yer reign ends heer n now!&quot; Ushering forth a roar that seemed to shake the foundation of the world itself he lept foreward, knocking the dark elf off his feet. He brought the axes down upon the skeletal servant in heavy blows, I heard the snapping of bone.<br>
<br>
The servant and troll battled back and forth, raining blow after blow upon eachother. Bone chips and blood began to cover the ground. The fenzy of melee combat was intense, the servant hissed, creaked, and laughed cruelly. The troll was strangely quiet, only now and then would he grunt as he swung as if to add more force to the bone shatering blows he was landing. I heard the incantations of magic, it was the necromancer's foul voice. I swore. I prayed silently to Tunare, focusing on the undead servant, it seemed and age passed then. A darkness seeped up from the swamp and swallowed the troll inside it's spectral mass. I finished my prayer and the skeleton was dismissed. I whirled round to seek out the necromancer but he was gone. I heard nothing but the troll bellowing in pain from the cruel spell that had been unleashed upon him. I dispelled the darkness from him and slumped to the ground. I was spent, I had no magical power from which to call from anymore. I could see my &quot;benefactor&quot; was in much pain, but would be damned if he'd admit it. Pieces of his armor had either fallen off or been beaten off and his left forearm was broken. Amazingly he still held his weapon in his left hand, though it could not have been much use to him anymore. He sniffed the air, and his eyes narrowed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why yus hewp Nazak? Me mite wanna kill n eets ya latur.&quot;<br>
<br>
I tried to say something then but the words stuck in my throat. Events of the night caught up with me all at once then and the world began to spin. I do not remember hitting the ground. I did not dream, I know not how long I slept, but when I awoke the realization of what had happened came back quickly. I sat up from the bed of moss I had slept on and saw noone. All was quiet, too quiet for the swamp. Not a single sound could I hear. Not the squak of a bird, the howl of a kobold, the squeek of a rat, nothing. I smelled food, good wholesome food cooking. I turned and saw a wood elf and a dawrf of all things standing around a campfire. I rubbed my eyes and blinked, my friends Kainiff and Charlam? How could they have known where I was? I tried to stand but was still too weak, Charlam noticed and the two came over to help me up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where...?&quot; I tried to speak before Charlam raised a finger to his lips and cut me short with a gentle &quot;Shhh&quot;<br>
<br>
Charlam pointed to a small hill a short distance away. Three trolls and an ogre stood there in some sort of conversation. He whispered that they wished me to join them when I was awake and that I wasn't to dilly dally. He cast a spell upon me which imbued me with the strength I would need to make it there. Charlam and Kainiff wished me well and sent me on my way. It felt very reassuring to have trusted companions nearby. I approached the hill that this motley bunch stood upon.<br>
<br>
Nazak stood there with a splint on his broken arm, his armor had been replaced. As well as cleaned? Another troll stood there a bit away from the others dressed in armor black as pitch. A blood red helmet he wore and had a large two handed sword that glamed coldly of necromatic power. I doubted a human could even heft it. An ogre shaman and troll shaman were also there, dressed in a pacel of different colored armor. Feathers and teeth from various beasts used as jewelry. Almost they seemed bright and cheerful compared to the other two, laughing often. From time to time magic flickered brightly from their hands. Then I noticed him... the elf was strapped tightly to a tree, beaten and bloody. A gag had been stuffed inside his mouth and his hands had been... removed. I almost felt sorry for him. Dark cousin or no, he was one of Tunare's creatures. I reached the hilltop and Nazak waved me over to stand inside their little circle around their &quot;catch&quot;.<br>
<br>
Nazak spoke. &quot;Dese my brudders. Alla dem dun wanna eets ya no mor, me talk em oudda it. Da shamuns go find yer frends when yu wus sleepin. Da shaduh nite help me hunt da dark elf n jus bout kill im fur yus.&quot; He then introduced me to them, &quot;Dis be Caya, she cleruk. Powerful majik she gots. Me say we let her kill dis dum elf.&quot; and he pointed at the helpless necromancer. &quot;Eberbudy gud wid dat?&quot; They all nodded their approval as if this had already been decided. I was then offered every sort of weapon imaginable with which to do the deed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I cannot.&quot; I cautiously dared to speak. &quot;He has learned his lesson and should be sent to Neriak in shame. They will deal with him there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He cannot return alive OR dead to Neriak.&quot; the one in black armor spoke in a deep cold voice. I was amazed at his fluency in the common tongue. &quot;Friend,&quot; he spat the word, &quot;if you lack the fortitude to complete the task then I shall take his unfortunate soul.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stood dumbfounded and unable to speak yet again. Swinging quickly the troll in black armor put his sword through my dark cousin's skull, green magic flared to life from the blade. My dark cousin twicthed in convulsions for a brief moment, then went still. They all cheered. I waited until they had finished.<br>
<br>
I dared to speak once more, &quot;Unfortunate. I surmise however that it was a necessary evil. Grobb would be at war with Neriak had he ben able to return. I must go, but before I do I thank you for your help Nazak, for whatever reason you decided to assist me I am truly grateful. Farewell my new friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
The shamans wouldn't let us leave till they imbued us with the power of &quot;The Mojo&quot; which made us run incredibly fast. They ran with us from the swamp all the way to the Northern Desert of Ro. There we parted company, and promised to meet again someday.<br>
<br>
In memory of my first trip to Innothule. We got bound inside of Grobb. =/<br>
Also in tribute to Nazak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub3.ezboard.com/udakkarfirewrath.showPublicProfile>DakkarFirewrath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of Brell</span><br>   <font color=#CC9900>(6/1/00 2:07:33 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An Unexpected Ally</span><hr size=1> Sometimes, the best alliances can be formed in the most ackward of places and the weirdest of times...<br>
