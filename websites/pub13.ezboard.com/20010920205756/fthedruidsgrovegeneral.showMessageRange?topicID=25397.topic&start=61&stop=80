And, what is the definition of low level quests? If he means people farming the Paw of Opalla quest, more power to them. If he means a level 53 can't do the Deputy Tagil quest, more power to them.<br>

Now, saying there will be no exceptions is utterly rediculous. Someone will *always* complain until they change a quest. Say a quest similar to the Coldain Prayer Shawls (by this I mean a multi-tiered quest that could be accomplished at different levels) was implemented. The first steps of the quest require that one kills frost giants, all of which are green to me. However, the final piece of the quest is suitable for someone of my level. So how would VI decide what &quot;level&quot; the quest would be? <br>

That is a very arrogant view, Salicia.  I play more than an hour a week, but basically you're saying that because I have a job and a life outside of EQ, my opinion shouldn't matter.  I'm sorry, but I disagree with that.<br>
<br>
Just because you had more spare time on your hands to get to level 60 before I did, that doesn't entitle you to any special treatment.  This new code is not taking away from anything that you already have, it's just adding new stuff, some of which your high level druid may not have access to.  You may think this unfair, but it's really not any different than the &quot;Starbucks and SUV&quot; loving crowd not being able to ever go to zones that require high end raiding.

The plat split from a dungeon crawl is average of 50pp.  With a 1 in 6 chance at a nice item, IF one drops.  So its not like we walk away with a 10k item every night.<br>
The majority of the new equipment will make your gear that you have now look like crap, even some of the mid-level items.  Imagine a 25ac 20wis 50mana shield dropping off a level 30 mob, that would be better than the shield most of you equip now, and if you are above level 45, then you have to buy that?  That's not right, why should i pay some lowbie's rediculously high price for a great shield I could easily obtain myself?<br>
There will also be a quest to upgrade your epic weapon, so that it will be up to par with the rest of the SoL gear, with verants previous track record, some of the quest items will be off green mobs, what then? Pay a lowbie to loot that item?  I think not.<br>
As to the statment made by Aldarion Shard, what's the point of leveling to 60 if the game *stops*?  I mean, why bother if you are just going to shelve a character you've put a lot of time into, and start over?<br>
Someone also brought up the Symbol of Tunare quest.  Sure, I have a much better neckpiece, but having a mana-free root helps a ton, and also frees up another spell slot.<br>
I can see verants reasoning behind this coding, they are trying to stop the Dr00ds from EverFarming.  But I don't feel locking high level people out of loot is the right way to go.<br>

<br>
Agreed.  The attraction of MMORPGs is that the game DOESN'T stop at 60 (or whatever the max. level, etc. may be).  It continues.  Those who argue that the game ends at 60 betray a leveling-oriented mindset.<br>
<br>
To me, the game doesn't, and shouldn't, stop at 60.  In many ways, it STARTS at 60.<br>

<br>
&quot;A quest that is 'broken' by this code will probably be pretty rare. A lot of the quests that will become unavailable for higher level characters will not be broken just because they can't be accessed by those characters. There will be a few quests that are intended for those higher level characters that will certainly need to be found and altered. And a few broken quests will not ruin the server at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, if you missed doing the quest at the &quot;right&quot; level, sorry.  I won't comment about causing working quests to become broken in a game with Quest in the title.<br>
<br>
The Warrens Code doesn't prevent pharming.  It just determines who the pharmer will be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucloudanetrihart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cloudane Trihart</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=25869912&img=5 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(7/31/01 12:01:15 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.cloudk.clara.net/storage/Frog3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stonebrunt Mountains</span><hr size=1> Tydaan put perfectly, what I was trying (and failing) to say in the &quot;edited out&quot; reply back there...<br>

Obviously, we (casual players) shouldn't be treated any better than anyone else... but it does cut both ways :) <br>
I don't know what Starbucks and SUV are - but in context, it sounded like a putdown against the casual and role players.  Which in turn, makes it sound like you think they're inferior in some way, and powergamers should get better treatment.<br>

It's totally non-intuitive for monsters not to drop their super secret special items just because you are too powerful for them.<br>
<br>
Anarchy Online has one thing going for it (and lots of things not going for it), since there are skill and or stat requirements for equipment twinking doesn't happen. More importantly, since you outgrow equipment there's a constant demand to get new, better gear.<br>
<br>
In comparison, in EQ at level 54, I'm still using the Charred Guardian Shield I got at level 22 because it's still a really decent item. If it were AO, where levels go up to 200, I would have probably gone through 4 or 5 shields from level 22 to 54.<br>

The TLC only applies to items coded as MAGIC.  So, spells shouldn't be affected, since for some insane reason spells are not MAGIC (our guild's rogue pickpockets them all the time).<br>
<br>
However, many quest items are coded as MAGIC and sure, Verant may get around to fixing them eventually, but don't count on it.

<br>
You said: <b>My question is this, if you are level 60 why do you need level 30 gear? To twink an alt? </b><br>
<br>
Your assumption here obviously is that gear a level 60 would want or wear wouldn't drop off a mob that wouldn't give the level 60 any experience (same for quest items).  This assumption is false.  There are items that drop off non-XP giving mobs that ARE useful for their stats or effects, and items that are desired for other reasons, such as appearance (see Cloudane's post above).<br>
<br>
This condition appears likely to continue with SoL.  Here's a recent quote from Brad:<br>
<br>
<b>Currently, yes, we do plan on turning the Trivial Loot Code on for all Luclin zones on all servers. Keep in mind that Luclin will have zones for levels 1-60, and we hope the Trivial Code will allow us to put some pretty enticing and powerful items in the lower and mid level zones without fear that some higher level players will bottom feed there. </b><br>
<br>
<br>
The reason why my gut reaction is to detest the TLC?  It's just a manifestation of Verant's desire to control exactly how the players play the game.  <br>
<br>
It should be obvious that it will do nothing to curb "pharming" or greediness among players.  It just changes the faces of the pharmers. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uscirocco.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scirocco</A> at: 8/1/01 12:20:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ucuchulainekynthelig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cuchulaine Kynthelig</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(8/1/01 11:18:39 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stonebrunt Mountains</span><hr size=1> Madu: Idol of the thorned is NOT level 30 gear. You think a level 30 warrior would use it, knowing he could sell it for 15-20kpp? <br>
<br>
GBS and fishbone earring are NOT level 30 gear. How many level  30s need a permanent water-breathing device? How many level 30 casters would keep GBS when they know they can sell it for 10k? <br>
<br>
I personally don't have a problem with TLC itself. What I have a problem with is gear that is wanted by high-level players dropping off low level mobs. That's just stupid! However, without the TLC, high level players can still get that gear without buying from low level farmers (yes, that's EXACTLY what they are). <br>
<br>
If they are going to implement TLC across all Luclin, then they should just make sure no high level items drop off low level mobs. If they do that, I won't have a problem with it. <br>
<br>
Cloudane: Soft wicker is not magic, lore, or no drop. Thus, it is not covered by TLC. You can get it at any level.  <p><a href="mailto:Cuchulaine_eq@hotmail.com">Cuchulaine Kynthelig</a> <BR>

<br>
the statement was not that your gameis over at 60.<br>
<br>
it was: at 60 you SHOULD be a god... you shouldnt NEED stuff droppedoff mobs that are green.  it wasnt a comment on &quot;you should quit at 60&quot; it was a comment on the fact that verant refuses to ever let its players becomepowerful.<br>
<br>
you really think there will be shields dropping off green mobs better than what your using now? i dont.  <br>
<br>
but anyway.  the fact remains. if a lvl 60 druid can attain a 20 wisdom 25 ac shield by EITHER a) hunting lvl 55ish mobs or b) farming lvl 20 mobs...  he/she should get it off the 55ish ones.  farming is nice for cash... but theres the erst of the world to farmfor cash in. getting gear through actual hyunting ismuch morefun... frming ispainfully boring.<br>
<br>
<br>
and no one has addressed thispoint either.  this shield we keep guessing about... its gonna go likethis (cause it always does) .... LOOT LOOT LOOT LOOT LOOT (NERF) ......<br>
...loot.........................................loot...........<br>

..loot (nerf) no longer drops<br>
<br>
TLC means, quite simply, that the people involved in the LOOT LOOT LOOT phase tkae a risk in getting it.<br>

<br>
I can see why Verant wants this... Your sever maybe overcrowded, but the market for MMORPG's is far from tapped.  A major stumbling block to getting new customers to stick around is the jealousy the new guy has for uber_guy01's twinked gear...  Ever since I started comming well over a year ago; I've always boggled at the &quot;What should I have...&quot; or &quot;how do I get phat lewt&quot; threads.  The people who post there always seem to feel rather gimp wearing gear that woulda made a equally leveled character in Nov of `99 stop and drool.   Then they act like it's the lack of gear that prevents them from leveling; not the fact they are n00b's who need to learn a few things.  The reason why they feel they need the item is cause they saw the twink with it.<br>
<br>
If the items are all that &quot;enticing and powerful&quot; then twinks and power levelers will farm them... assing out the mid-leveled crowd again.  You'll be sure as hell to see my Uber level 32 paladin farming whatever I find &quot;enticing&quot; to my cleric.<br>
