<br>
&gt;Quotes on Psychodelia:<br>
&gt;Wizards are the best class vs. mobs that heal. A well<br>
&gt;placed stun or a large DD will prevent many things(such as<br>
&gt;myconid priests or dragons) from healing themselves.<br>
<br>
Other class can stun too so I wouldn't say wizards are the best at that. In fact when I try to stun, some enchanter usually beat me to it. Not sure if a large DD interupts casting, then again I never try to interupt casting with a DD<br>
<br>
&gt;Wizard direct damage indirectly heals the group. Instant<br>
&gt;massive damage eliminates the nead to melee it for that<br>
&gt;extra time, thus saving hit points and saving healer mana. <br>
<br>
You have sunstrike and such but I mainly attack with draughts; and 650ish damage doesn't save that much time IMO. It probly saves 10 sec probly and a warrior doesn't lose much hit points in 10 sec against a single mob.<br>
<br>
&gt;Wizards can attack from long range and their damage is<br>
&gt;automatic. This is essential on large raids, when melee<br>
&gt;classes can often loose sight of the mob, get in each<br>
&gt;others way, or suffer from a close range NPC attack(such<br>
&gt;as area effect)<br>
<br>
It is dangerous for casters to cast when the tanks lose sight of the mob. Without tanks taunting, the mob starts to take out the caster one by one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upsychodelia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Psychodelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/9/01 1:53:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/DIAN4/ec1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you think a wizard is the master of?</span><hr size=1> Im glad you addressed this Tuvack. Ill try and respond back if I may.<br>
<br>
What I meant by large DD stopping healing is that a high damage DD will kill the mob before it heals, not interrupt its casting. Other classes should use their stuns while the wizards use their DD on a healing mob. Landing a stun between the dd is a good strategy also when the mob is a healer.<br>
<br>
Concerning brainbite : Id rather talk about this in game. In short, I worship the use of this spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Draughts are fine too. Also, wizards(if they use concussion effectively) dont take damage, they give it. And if they get hit, a skin spell should give them enough time to land a brainbite to taunt the mob off of them. Some stuff, like in the new Velious zones will summon and kill you unless you cast concussion between each nuke.<br>
<br>
More is lost in 10 seconds than just tank hit points. You can lose a spawn altogether. You can lose a cleric, lose an enchanter. You can lose the thing you are fighting. There are a million reasons why it is better to kill something fast. The best combo for killing something is about 50/50. A taunter for every wizard, not all melee. The reason is simple: Kill the creature/creatures before they kill you. This is why these new Velious gods with a million HPs are so hard now. They cant be killed quickly. Its as simple as that. (wizards certainly aren't masters against velkator(sp?)<br>
<br>
About tanks loosing sight of the mob, getting in the way etc:   <br>
True, it isn't safe to nuke when there isn't a taunter. But its much safer with concussion.  Direct damage has advantage over melee in that it has vast range. Think about this..Only so many tanks can simultaneously hit one mob at once, yet you could fill the entire lair with wizards who are constantly casting instant damage. Chances are the thing will be dead before it has any opportunity to do any serious harm. This is of course the raid scenario. The single group scenario most likely consists of several lower hp mobs. A wizard can blast down the first couple and let the rest of the group finish the lonely couple left while he meditates. Group says &quot;wow, we rock.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again , I cant stress this enough:<br>
<br>
IF YOU ARE A WIZARD THAT PLANS ON DOING RAIDS IN VELIOUS&lt; YOU ARE GOING TO NEED BRAINBITE(CONCUSSION)<br>
cast it after every nuke you land on these high hit point mobs.<br>
<br>

<br>
About large DD stopping healing, where do we find a fast and large enough DD? Good timing can eliminate the need of fast cast, but I think I've seen a mob starting to gate with 20% or more hp and I don't think any single pre-60 DD can kill it.<br>
<br>
I'll talk to you about brainbite in game if/when I activate my account again. I try not to let EQ take over my life <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I have brainbite and I can relate to what you mean. Root used to be sufficient to safe own butts but brainbite is what keeps us alive against summoning mobs.<br>
<br>
&quot;More is lost in 10 seconds than just tank hit points. You can lose a spawn altogether. You can lose a cleric, lose an enchanter. You can lose the thing you are fighting.&quot;<br>
-spawns begin to cluster? use enchanters<br>
-lose groupmembers? they should learn to deal with aggro. We don't have the mana to burn down every mob they aggro if they do so too often anyway.<br>
-lose the mob due to gating/healing? everyone who can stun, should.<br>
<br>
Assuming a wizard can make a mob die 10 sec earlier with 1 nuke and benefit the group in all the various ways you described, a group doesn't always have a wizard and a good one at that, and thus will mostly likely not do things that require this special ability of wizzies... eg. a group will not say &quot;ok we have a wizzie. let's pull a few more mobs every cycle than before.&quot; (opposite of losing spawns) Conversely, do people specifically ask to group with a wizard so they can do more spawns? I think it might actually be the opposite because a mage do more total damage in one night. Also mages and druids are good wizard substitutes that can probly do 75% of the dmg of wizards in DD. This follows that you have to argue the 33% DD bonus over druid/mages is significant. IE a wizard makes a mob die 2 second faster by nuking than when replaced by a mage (excluding pet). Sorry to burst your bubble but wizard's single-target DD is not THAT wonderful:P especially when there is the mage class. We are good at AoE and not much more.<br>
<br>
In recap, a wiz is only superior as a damage dealer to a mage/druid by having brainbite and the +33% nuking bonus.<br>
But mage pets makes up the damage and druids are the 2nd best healer with the new added spell (nature's touch? not sure.)<br>
<br>
Anyway I'm glad I'm not a necro lol. 6 months ago I would have exchanged my wiz for a necro if possible after seeing a necro soloing frenzied ghoul room. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bbrellserilis.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rayster>Rayster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/12/01 2:13:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you think a wizard is the master of?</span><hr size=1> I can't resist not replying, but wizard class in general is NOT the most efficient damage dealer in most experience group / long fight situation.  There really isn't much benefits when you kill a most fast because you will go out or low on mana on the next 5 or so mezzed mobs and rather become obsolete in the group when you have to med for the next 5 ro 8 minutes. Necromancer and magician can out damage a wizard any time in any long fight / exp group. The only time wizard is best / preferred class is when doing raid / dragon encounter (need lure spells / fast killing). This is what I feel. /shrug<br>

Psychodelia and I went into the little details but Rayster painted the big picture quite accurately.<br>
<br>
All the tricks (eg. kill the first few mobs quickly in a pull) and benefits (eg. save time) of our DD's do not only apply to wizards, but many other caster classes too. Wizards are just slightly better at those after considering the slighly better efficiency and fast casting.<br>
<br>
(In fact, in the aspect of saving time by burning down mobs, wizards are only better because we are more flexible in that we can choose when to kill fast. Pet classes outdamage us in a long term if the pet's damage is included, thus save MORE time than wizards) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utuvack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tuvack</A> at: 3/15/01 5:31:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#313532><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upsychodelia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Psychodelia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/21/01 4:29:34 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/DIAN4/ec1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you think a wizard is the master of?</span><hr size=1> Where in my posts did I say that wizards were the best damage dealers in a long group situation? Damage is balanced in long group situations , but I agree that wizards dont do the most over time.<br>
<br>
It depends on who a wizard is grouped with. You get three tanks, an enchanter, a healer, and a wiz, its gonna be slower battles, less downtime.  If you have three wiz, an enchanter, and a healer, battles are faster but downtime is increased.<br>
<br>
A wizard IS efficient in experience groups. I was the first player on this server to hit 60 through grouping alone. Never soloed once. Doesnt that tell you something?<br>
<br>
 It depends on the group that you have. Groups can be caster heavy, tank heavy, and this effects what other classes you need to fill in the spots. The wizard needs an enchanter, maybe a tank to taunt. The tank needs a healer/buffer plus the enchanter. There are several variations to grouping and several places where certain combinations will work better than others.  Some mobs have a ton of hps and dont hit that hard. Thats good for a tank heavy group.  Some places have things that hit hard but have few hps. Many places have a mix of both.<br>
<br>
In order to get a good idea of what im talking about, group in Charasis one day. There is quite a diversity of mobs there, ranging from heavy hitters with few hit points to hp monsters that hit softly.  Velkator is kind of like this too Ive noticed. Dragon necropolis as well.<br>
