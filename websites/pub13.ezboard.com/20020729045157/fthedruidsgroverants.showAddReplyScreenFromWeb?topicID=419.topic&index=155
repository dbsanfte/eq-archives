Thank you.  As someone else suggested all you have to do is NOT come here and it won't bother you.  Most of the people that have replied, positive or negative I have respect for.  Your total lack of sincereity, and respect has made me decide to quit wasting my time with you.  Please read ALL the other threads, post to your hearts content and ignore mine.  If it were within my power to delete this thread I would, but now I can't because whatever NAZI ass that moderates this thing decided to take away my ability to login/post as the author of it.  Apparently for saying Doodie Head.. or Moron. <br>
<br>
I have NEVER posted anything to this thread to bump it, nor have I done it when it was even half way down the first page.  The thread has made it to the bottom and to the second page and repeatedly someone has posted something that bumped it back to the top of page 1.  For the LOVE OF GOD!! (thats me in case you forgot)  STOP COMING here... STOP posting and it will go away.  <br>
<br>
If however you feel you have something to post that is worthwhile and or meanginful then by all means.  The ones that say &quot;BUMP&quot; and the 99 bottles of beer etc...  thanks, we have seen enough of those.<br>
<br>
Finally, if nobody posts.... OMG OMG it WILL go away.  <br>
<br>
I guess it pisses you off, Manthis that I have a job that I get paid to do whatever I want to... even come here and post just to annoy you.  So... =p  I get paid to do it!  Actually I get paid to come here and post just because it tortures you so and I get such a laugh out of it and your feeble replies! hahaha  Or maybe thats what you want to hear?<br>
<br>
P.S. At the end was a question for Manthis but I deleted it so he would not feel compelled to reply. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gandienii>Gandien II</A> at: 11/3/00 2:36:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uderykl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>derykl</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 192<br> <font color=#333399>(11/3/00 5:37:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=156>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cloudk.clara.net/storage/zidane.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Manthis</span><hr size=1> You flame him and don't expect him to reply?<br>

Im not asking MOMMY, or anyone for that matter to make him stop.  He comes here and bitches up a storm because he doesnt like what he see's, instead of just not coming here.  If he wants to come back and post more of his comments... hey, I told him the best way to avoid it all!<br>
<br>
I am going to guess that Manthis is a democrat.  He wants more government regulation etc... instead of being able to decide for himself what to do.  I am thinking that he is one of those compulsive people that comes here... because he can't stop.  I just think it's entertaining.<br>
<br>
So if manthis lights lighter, and puts his hand over the flame till its burned, he wants to be able to sue the lighter manufacturer, and get congress to pass a law against lighters without safety devices so you can't burn yourself.<br>
<br>
Me, I would just rather not stick my hand in the flame because I learned the first time I touched something hot that it hurts and I won't do it again.<br>
<br>
And this, derkyl, is a flame!! What I posted above was a plea for him to go away! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uflaim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flaim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 615<br> <font color=#333399>(11/3/00 6:25:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=159>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> troll part deux</span><hr size=1> I am one of those twisted individuals that actually gets amused while watching 2 children fight over silly stuff..<br>

I had to say something tho...  I am constantly amazed at ppl that sit on the train tracks and then get pissed when the train runs em down...  Trains are a matter of fact in this game...  If you don't want to get hit with em then don't sit at the zoneline where every train ends up...  When you hunt the zone you should realize the risks and act accordingly...  And frankly I don't think it's my job to know where your party is hunting...  Zonelines are unsafe if ya haven't figgered that out by now you deserve to die 4 times...  <br>

If I was your employer and I had a small disciplinary matter to discuss with you and got the attitude you have conveyed on this board the minor infraction would have also ended up as a major one...

I don't argue with my boss.  I CAN argue with a waitress at a restaurant or the manager of a hotel, or Sony/VI's Customer service director.  Further, you must not be high enough level to go to karnors.  There are TWO zone sides very close together.  As I REPEATEDLY stated (you moron) IF IF IF used correctly nobody has to die from a train.  When 99.99999% of the people there understand and abide by this there is no trouble.  But one ass decides to INTENTIONALLY run over people on his way out with his train... then I get pissed.  <br>
<br>
BUT, heres the BIG BUT...... My complaint on this board had Zero, Zilch, Zipola to do with getting trained.  It had to do with what VI tries to pass off as customer service.  Go back and read post number 2435324543535  to catch a clue.  MORON.<br>

Glutton for punishment I guess. And here is the conclusion I come to.<br>
<br>
You have had two posting accounts disabled by the board admin because folks find your manner of communication to be caustic and rude.<br>
<br>
The validity of what you say is not being called into question, but the manner in which you present it is. Perhaps you don't see this, which would explain why you feel compelled to argue with all the folks who dismiss you. They aren't telling you that you are wrong because of the facts of what happen, they are telling you that you are wrong because of the way in which they happend.<br>
<br>
You were curt. You appeared to be rude in the way you closed the conversation, at least from the GM's point of view, and currently in the point of view of every single person in this thread who has called on you on it.<br>
<br>
I would guess that this is exactly the way you treat people in game, in which case folks were WAITING for you to do something petitionable, no matter how small just to get that /report off and get you the hell out. Much like the board admin has been doing here.<br>
<br>
You are destroying yourself publically in the manner you choose to present. Sorry you don't have that whole tact thing worked out yet, but once you get the hang of it, you might find yourself receiving the muzzle a mite less often. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants>Rants</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
