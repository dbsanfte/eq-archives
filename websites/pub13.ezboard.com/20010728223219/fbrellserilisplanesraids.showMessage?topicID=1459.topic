Do you think tradition raiders (lower lvl content) should begin working with higher lvl raiders who are interested in the new content?  What should their cooperation consist of?<br>
<br>
Should higher level raiders take away a reservation spot from the traditional raiders or can we use a tiered reservation system based on content level?<br>
<br>
How do we take advantage of the content without allowing any of it going to waste?  Gods left up for days, armor rotting.<br>

<br>
Some mobs a little harder.  Meastro seemed to have more HPs and a higher level, but still went down like a chump.  Some Golems in Fear actually require you to buff your groups, instead of your enchanter charming them and using them for pets for a while.  Mini-Bosses in Hate hit for around 250ish, but can still be killed pretty easy.<br>
<br>
At this time  I see no reason to change how things have been done.  Gods however need a high level crew to come in and help or assist. <p><img border="1" src="http://www.yellowspine.com/images/char1.bmp" width="360" height="94"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uthaloc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaloc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Adventurer of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/18/01 9:32:02 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion on Hate/Fear level content</span><hr size=1> I haven`t been to either Hate or fear since the patch, so I won`t comment.<br>

Lets be honest Fear and Hate get pretty damn easy after a while with a decent pull team.  The typical person on most raids is over 50th level anyway, has far better stuff thanks to Kunark and Velious than when people started raiding the planes way back when.  On Harpers last Hate and Fear raid we didnt have a single wipe out and in Hate only TWO people died for the whole raid.  Seriously they were justified in  making the planes a bit harder and it seems from what Ive read they did it the right way (leaving most of the zone the same and just buffing the areas around the Gods for the most part).  Cazic became a wimp after the increased level cap and better equipment people aquired in Kunark and now velious--its hard to be afraid of a God that cons even to you even with Verants messed up con sytem <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Fear/Hate raids were becoming ho hum boring now theres new reason to go there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Brimhoff

As to armor rotting, no Iksar SK's signed up for my raid til after I had groups set.  So....I invited one to come hang out with us, fill any spots if NoShows or early departures occur, and grab any of the new Iksar armor if it drops.  Much better thn letting it rot IMHO.<br>

Nothing else to add - No Ct, no Draco, no Golems for our raid  (.<br>

Maestro dropped pretty easy, the mini bosses were nothing spectacular (they did look cool). The biggest this was the Spam lag from the second floor Mobs. I do have to say the random Emotes were cool /cheer Verant. It added some atmosphere. Another note on the second floor from what I understand the Mobs are 100 MR so maybe use a similar strategy as the golems. Was an awesome Night up there.. Some great changes.

CT's a bitch.  Period.  I think it's fair to consider CT FFA until more than 3 groups can show they can take him down.  As long as a CT raid doesn't interfere with the next day's regular fear raid, bring them on.  Let's see CT &amp; Inny die on Brell.<br>
<br>
As for Inny's floor, it seems like very few raids can dedicate the time to clearing the 1st floor, and then also doing the second floor.  Something should be worked out somehow to allow 2nd floor raids to go on. <p><img src="http://www.pangea.ca/~grinch/sadune2.jpg" width="400" height="175"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udrillin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drillin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/19/01 12:43:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion on Hate/Fear level content</span><hr size=1> Havent been to new fear yet but to new hate twice.<br>
<br>
Hate the first floor (6-8 hour typical raid)  Same difficulty as before with a portal break instead of running off to corner.  Only thing that had changed is maestro with a boost of a couple levels and still same lame loot.  Most raids pittle out after this unless the sub bosses are up (1-2 hours to get them all).  Then the second floor (approximately 180 - 200 mobs based on tracking majority 55+ mobs) the level for this I would suggest being slightly higher to take down if going to be efficient at it.  Both raids left within killing 10 mobs off this floor due to time and people wanting to leave.<br>
  It would be easy to reinforce the troops and continue the raid but most are tired after this.  I would almost suggest a second raid to do the uppstairs except for the fact when over 30 people in the zone LD went wild every fight.<br>
It will be interesting to see how raids will go from here, concerning the second floor.<br>

We pretty much rolled over the silly inkies. I'd guess any raid with a sizable contingent of 55+ would do the same. <br>
<br>
I'd leave any cooperation amongst guilds to the guilds involved. There really isnt any need to make up more silly bureaucratic rules, if people want to joint raid, let em figure it out themselves. <br>
<br>
Fear is really still too damn easy with the exception of CT. Draco isn't much harder than the old CT, Terror is a pushover, about the level of prepatch CT. <br>
<br>
CT is a badass. I don't see him going down much unless a raid is all 57+ and knows exactly what they are doing, and has mastered the appropriate strategies for a 200k hp mob. Thats a lot of hitpoints to chew through when hes quadding for 600. I got to use my disciplines twice during the fight. <br>
<br>
Inny is far easier, our raid, which really was losing people at that point, got him below 40% on a halfhearted attempt. I'm guessing he'll go down quite a bit, if you can keep people awake that long. His loot bites anyway, so he's not really worth the effort.  <p>ICQ#-105127301<BR>

Spread them out and it becomes a bit less of a problem and might open up 2nd floor raids. One raid might want to look into giving this a try and seeing how the lag and LD's end up. <br>
<br>
Hate 2nd floor mobs are unmezable, get stuck trying to get at you, and Spam you to LD when they get stuck. Some can be pulled, while others the pathing is so bad you have to just charge. 1st Floor is pretty much still geared (Difficulty wise) to the normal armor raid (46-54) 2nd floor is a little more difficult but probably not that bad. Inny for the upper level people (55-60). Second floor mobs drop Druid/Ranger/Paladin PoG type armor, a few Int Caster items (Robe and Shoulder I know of), some weapons, and a few other items.<br>
<br>
Fear I see the Golems as what Cazic used to be to old raids. Fairly hard but not so hard a normal armor raid (46-54) can't kill them. Draco is a mid level encounter (52-57). Cazic is upper level encounter (55-60)<br>
<br>
Most normal armor raids just arent going to be able to stay alive long enough to take down 200K HP when the mobs Quad for 400 and 600.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ukraghack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraghack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Protector of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 615<br> <font color=#CC9900>(3/19/01 11:30:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Discussion on Hate/Fear level content</span><hr size=1> <br>
Inny is pretty wussy.  I pulled him accidentally when he aggroed on me and popped into our camp.  We were unbuffed and low on mana and still got him to 50-60%.  He's slowable and his gflux attack is weak, but it can put you far enough away from him that you lose some combat time.  If he hadn't warped and started summoning people one by one I think we could have beaten him.  <br>
<br>
I hope Verant takes out whatever is causing the uber LD on the second floor though.  I almost never go LD and I dropped 2 times that night. <p>Bahd - Level 57 monk<BR>
