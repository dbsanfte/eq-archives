I can't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  believe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> half the stuff posted here... you druids seem SO obsessed with the shaman's ability to slow, as a much better healer than you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  NEWS FLASH: THE FOLLOWING CLASSES CAN ALSO SLOW</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Chances are, you probably will have the opportunity to group with one, too!<br>
<br>
Enchanter - 70% at level 58<br>
Bard - not exactly sure, probably like 40% with an instrument<br>
Ranger - Epic procs, 40% slow<br>
Necro -50% undead slow, perfect in howling stones. Hey they can also heal well too! bonus!<br>
Beastlord - 30% spell, 55% epic.<br>
<br>
If you're going to bitch about not being able to heal in groups, it's your own nimrodic fault for including a class that makes your job eaier <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondly... you will whine and whine about torpor, the disadvantages of which have already been explained one hundred times over. You're comparing your STORE BOUGHT SPELL to our extremely rare, balanced due to limitations and inability to cast it out of group, heal over time, which is often highly inferior to a direct heal, ESPECIALLY when you are trying to get someone out of low HP agro.<br>
<br>
For God's sake...that heal you guys suggested on the other page... 2500hp for 350 mana....you want a spell that heals more than twice the health of torpor, for 150 more mana, in a direct heal, with no penalties.... if so, this spell had better drop off Diablo Xi Va or something...  The fact that you can buy an entire druid spellbook several times over (Minus a couple gems they share with others like Sol Levi/EB and RGC)... for the price that this one spell fetches on most servers... and guess what? we have 4 other spells that are the same price and rarity! whoop-de-frickin'-do!<br>
<br>
Essentially, you are only thinking of yourselves, me me me, it's my job to heal in the group, I'm all by myself. Instead, how about using that brain and finding a way to work with other classes to solve your limitations? You might be pleasantly surprised.<br>
<br>
Okay I'm done ranting... again think of it this way... you clicked your character, you saw LOW DIFFICULTY... and you assumed by freeloading your way through the game you get to see the best ending. How quaint.<br>
<br>
On one final note, if you are specialized in evocation and you are bitching about healing...that's not veran't fault, it's your own short sightedness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usobesilvertree.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sobe Silvertree</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/misc_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 961<br> <font color=#333399>(7/18/02 2:32:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Moved reply - Originally on update on balance thread</span><hr size=1> Bamana DeMoro posted the following reply on:<br>

Subject: Re: Dropped Spells<br>
<br>
I totally agree that dropped spells were poorly thought out.<br>
<br>
Most of the population will never see the mobs needed to attain some of the rarer spells. When will VI realize that spells aren't like our weapons, they're like our disciplines, they are our life's blood. <br>
<br>
A melee with poor weapons is still wanted in groups because they can still deal/take damage. A caster without key/rare spells is passed up in favor of those who have those spells because they simply cannot contribute as much.<br>
<br>
This is an inherant imbalance.<br>
<br>
VI, big, sweeping changes aren't really needed to Balance casters. Give us all our spells, (the ones all the ubers already have anyhow) and we will be well on our way to being competitive.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with Ancient spells dropping off uber mobs, but don't make it harder for us to get to the point where we can kill uber mobs. <br>
<br>
Many casters are stuck in lower &quot;tier&quot; guilds and cannot get the spells we need, this leads to us not getting into the groups we need, wich further contributes to us being left out. <br>
<br>
Please, when balancing casters don't forget the plight of those 99% of us who would be a lot closer to being &quot;balanced&quot; if we had a full spell book (minus ancient spells, of course). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/udyrk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dyrk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>First Post!</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333399>(7/19/02 5:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Moved reply - Originally on update on balance thread</span><hr size=1> Wait a second...<br>

&quot;When will VI realize that spells aren't like our weapons, they're like our disciplines, they are our life's blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
And most of those spells you can purchase for a pittance from a vendor. At least up until the high end ones. This is where your analogy to a melee's gear actually is a good one. How many melee's do you know who have EVER used a single piece of gear that was purchased at a merchant? How many 10's of K PP does a melee need to shell out for continual upgrades until he can't even buy the high end ones because they become NO DROP? How many in the high end game have few items that aren't even NO DROP?  <br>
<br>
A warrior with poor weapons CANNOT hold agro and thus can't fulfill his role as a main tank. 5000  hp? Defensive Discipline? Who cares?  If you can't keep the mobs attention -- through use of high end/high taunt weapons -- it becomes useless. Other melee's with poor weapons have a lower DPS and are therefore less valuable. Sounds like both casters and melees are in somewhat of the same boat here.<br>
<br>
People have spoken out against the homogenization of all the classes. What about the homogenization within a single class? Shouldn't there be something to distinguish the truly dedicated and excellent players at the top of the their servers from others? <br>

<br>
As will the better gear with focus effects.<br>
<br>
We are used to having spells be hard to obtain.  There is at least one Shaman in my guild that still needs torpor, some wizzies need Sunstrike, etc.  You kill dragons and cross your fingers.<br>
<br>
The poorly thought out aspect of the Luclin implementation is that there is no farmable area where you can get a fair representation of the level 60 spells.  In Kunark you could.  In Veloius...well there really was only one 60 spell for us in Velious...but that dropped in a lot of places including non boss mobs.<br>
<br>
With Luclin, level 60 spells drop only from named mobs in specific zones.  These mobs have timers of 3 to 7ish days, and are usually killed within a half hour or so of spawning.  There is no opportunity here to go farm most of the spells.<br>
<br>
Ok there is the priest ring in akheva for some priest spells.  But as far as I know that is the only spot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showPrevMessage?topicID=710.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showNextMessage?topicID=710.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=3><img src=http://dev.thedruidsgrove.org/images/forum/addreplya.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.emailToFriend?topicID=710.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.threadControl?topicID=710.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/gfx/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=710.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=710.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thedruidsgrovegeneral">General - EQ<option value="thedruidsgrovegeneralot">General - OT<option value="thedruidsgrovespells">Spells<option value="thedruidsgrovequests">Quests<option value="thedruidsgrovehuntingguide">Hunting Guide<option value="thedruidsgrovedruidicequipment">Druidic Equipment<option value="thedruidsgroverants">Rants<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm18">FAQ & Index<option value="thedruidsgroveboardpostingrulesandpolicy">Board Posting Rules And Policy<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm20">Spoilers<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm22">Polls<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm25">PvP<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm27">General - DAOC<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm29">The Druids Circle<option value="thedruidsgrovefrm30">Class Balance <option value="thedruidsgrovefrm31">Interface Design</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333399>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bthedruidsgrove>The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants>Rants</a> <font color=#333399> - </font><a href="http://www.thedruidsgrove.org">The Druids Grove</a><font color=#333399> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
