-----------snip---------snap-----------<br>
Was nice to have this finally take off on safehouse boards.. was solved quickly.  Heres a quick walk thru, sorry i dont have all the mob names.<br>
Starts in Katta.. guy in church (yaddayaddayadda the caretaker) gives you a list in combine w/the 12 items and some clues.. you dont need to talk to him first though, just go collect the items.<br>
Theres 4 quests, one for melees, one for int casters, and one for wis casters (and monks and beastlords.. pallys can use the priest class and the melee one)  <br>
Each quest requires 1000 gold to an npc in either shadowhaven or sharvahl.. <br>
each quest requires a piece from fungus grove, <br>
each requires a piece from twilight sea, <br>
and each requires one off a bandit, 2 in marus seru, and 1 in shadeweaver's thicket.<br>
(I'm repeating tons of stuff sorry)<br>
for melees you need Talikar's stuff:<br>
Ancient Ornate Combine Dagger from Maricella Slithera in Paludal Caverns at pos 424, pos 1374.  She is off on a ledge from the yelloweyes bandit camp near the shadowhaven zone.  She has a PH and was actually the hardest part of the quest for me since I had to wait through 4 place holders and 3 spawns of her before I got the dagger.  Shes green to 57 and gives +havendefenders and -havensmugglers and -lakereconditebandits<br>
Talikar Family Signet Ring- From halfling male in twilight sea, dropped it second time for me.  The three twilight mobs are on the island with the docks just outside the katta zone.  They are all green at 57, about 1k hp each, and all standing together.  No faction hits, didnt help each other.<br>
Faded Portrait of a Lady- you give Pietro Guiccii in the shadowhaven library area by the inn (loc is +1468 +66) 1000 gold coins for a painting he found.<br>
Antique Platinum Medal- Kill Ebben Quickblade in the inn in the 2nd outpost from echo in Fungus grove.  Lt blue to 57, no faction hits, no one helped him, dropped item first time for me and had roughly 2200 hp. <br>
The reward is a *VERY* nice sword, WAR, PAL, BRD, RNG, ROG, SHD, Magic Lore Primary Secondary 16/29 +5 magic damage, +12 dex +10 MR, neg 5 stamina and strenght though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but +2% to divination and **15** ac.. *drool*<br>
For int casters you'll need:<br>
Aeridia Family Signet Ring-  Drops off recuso smugglers in marus seru (loc is neg 915, pos 1500) There are 4 guys standing by the zone wall.. they can be either smugglers or regular recusos. You get some +seru hits w/these and some -recuso and -havensmugglers.  I got ring off first one that i killed.<br>
Sealed Golden Scroll Tube- Get from Mark blotter in shadowhaven library.. he sells some basic spells and is found near the guy that sells the robes, like the next row over. He mentions to be careful with the old scrolls and scroll equipment but I couldnt get him to mention the tube.. but he gives it to you for 1000 gold coins (even when he wont sell to you, i did this after they 'fixed' the faction necklace and he didnt like me anymore) <br>
Faded Silver Embroidered Robe- Kill Rolktim Cogtop at neg 1243 neg 646 in fungus grove, again no faction hits and no one helps him.  he dropped it first time for me.<br>
Tarnished Copper Runed Wand-  Drops off human male in twilight sea, got mine first time (i had to kill halfling twice so i killed all 3 2x and he didnt have it the 2nd time) again same w/other twilights very low level and no faction hits.<br>
I was a little disappointed w/the reward its a 2hb and +12 int and 5 ac and maybe 13/30 or something..NEC, WIZ, ENC, MAG the stats are on the link on the post below.  It would be a good twink item though until you bought a stein of maggok and another held item.<br>
For BST, MNK, PAL, SHM, CLR, DRU heres your quest-<br>
Gold embroidered Kilt- Missy McElle in fungus grove at neg 1130, neg 800.  light blue to 57, dropped it first time for me, no faction hits or help from any one. Its a leg item (ac 3) that has no graphic and limited class/race<br>
silver Embroidered Tabard- drops off the half-elf female in twilight.. dropped first and 2nd time i killed her. green, easy, no faction hits.  Is a chest item (ac 2 large races only no graphic, looks like a headband/sash graphic)<br>
Ancient Ceremonial Warhammer- Drops off the recuso smugglers in marus seru at neg 915, pos 1500.. got ring for melee off first one i killed, and the hammer off the 3rd (2 smugglers were up on 1st spawn cycle, 2 were up for second) smugglers are green at 57 and have maybe 1000-1100 hp around there<br>
Old Sealed Medicine Pouch- give 1000 gold to alchemist hikel in Shal Vahl at neg 255 neg 380.. shes right next to the bank, and the portrait guy and scroll tube guy arent that far from a bank either for you strength challenged.<br>
the reward for this i was very sickened by.. imho they could have dropped cleric and shaman from who can wear it, and druids too. I might have wielded this at level 1 thru maybe 34 or so when I got my shield of falsehood and my paw of oppolla, but probably not.  Stats were 2hb 18/38 wt 4.0 ac 10 +5 magic damage, -5 str/sta +12 wis.. maybe +10 mr too i forget.  An ok monk 2hb if you dont mind the 4.0 wt and you dont have better.. but ugh.. I'd rather have had a 5 ac earring or a 20 ac shield or even a 1hb or something.. this was very disappointing for int/wis casters when you look at the 1hs reward for the 6 melee types that 1hs.<br>
If you are going to do this, and dont mind paying 300 pp total you might as well do all 3 at once.. i got maybe 1/4 a blue exp at 57 from killing and turning stuff in and many of the mobs are close to each other..(although I did some other quests too in the meantime)<br>
heres how i'd do it over if i had to:  Start in shar vahl, get the pouch from shaman.  Run thru hollowshade (checking for named guy in owlbear cave first if you have invis hee hee) to Paludal caverns. Camp Marciella for a little while, get the dagger.  Run up to shadowhaven, pay the guys for the tube and the painting, head out to nexus and then netherbian lair and then to marus.  Go over to smuggler area, get the hammer and the ring, head back to shadowhaven (or gate if you got it). go through echo to fungus grove. kill the 3 guys, then invis and run to the twilight sea portal (you did know theres a TS portal in FG right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  go east to the island w/the friendly (well depending on faction hee hee) NPC's, kill the twilight trio under the tree.  Zone into Katta, turn right, go up the ledge, past to the graveyard, and turn the stuff in.  When you turn the stuff in 4 at a time, a mob will spawn that you give a crate of their belongings to that the caretaker gives to you.  For me, the wis staff guy spawned to my left facing the caretaker, the int caster to the right, and the melee guy behind him and a little to the left. They are invis like shadow men but have their names visible.  <br>
some notes-<br>
None of the mobs casted.. all seemed to be warriors or rogues, not sure i didnt turn my back to them. 3 were light blue, 6 were green at 57.<br>
I dont know if you can kill the 3 npcs for the items instead of giving them the 1000 gp.. one guy tried but one of them was an enchanter.. I dont recommend trying to pull the alchemist in the middle of the cat city.  The scroll tube guy was a vendor so i doubt he'd leave a corpse let alone the item. I didnt check the alchemist to see if she was a vendor or not.<br>
I didnt see if 100pp worked versus 1000 gold.. but in all the other quests i've tried the plat worked just fine.<br>
the 3 twilight mobs, 3 fungus mobs, 2 drops in marus and 2 purchases in shadowhaven were pretty close to each other in their respective zones.  Not a lot of running around if you are doing all 3, just a short trip to sharvahl and paludal caves. <br>
You will take a few bad faction hits with seru when turning in the items, and some +katta ones.. but thats expected.  Was fun quest over all though looking for the stuff.  I'm hoping maybe you can turn in all 3 and another item to get something better though, oh well.  At least I got one of these swords <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As of this moment, it looks like Magic DMG: 5 acts like adding 5 DMG to the weapon DMG if the mob is 100% resistant to magic.  If it is partially resistant, if it suceeds at for example a 80% save vs Magic, then it would be like adding 4 to the DMG. 60% - 3 DMG... Failed resists, 0 DMG (though interestingly enough, a 0 damage weapon may have a Minimum/Maximum of 1 damage, sine people using this weapon in the offhand are finding that they no longer have any hits for 1 damage, but are getting 2 damage hits)<br>

And the quest is a walk in the park, complete piece of cake, and to TOP it all off... its not no drop, so uber guilds are farming it as we speak <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ustaticbb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>staticbb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/18/01 4:51:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3257.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Long Sword of Etheral Energy</span><hr size=1> not no drop can you say chi ching....that kind of weapon would be easy to sell...after i get my own of course...noww to find my business partner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uaauan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aauan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(12/19/01 6:54:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3257.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Long Sword of Etheral Energy</span><hr size=1> i was told by a druid who was farming the sword that the chick in paludal was nerfed to a 16 hour spawn, can anyone confirm this? he was gonna sit there the whole time, so thats 32 hours before i'd even get a shot at him, thats seems kinda...extreme.<br>

Just a question about the LSoEE.  How do you think it compares to a SoM?  That's my other 1hs choice right now, and I can't really decide which is better.  I'm usually my guild's main tank, so I'm thinking the LSoEE would be with the 15 AC. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uskellt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skellt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/4/02 2:07:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3257.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Long Sword of Etheral Energy</span><hr size=1> Can anyone describe precisely where Yurddle the Caretaker is?

Hopefully they will tinker with spawn times, mob level or something other than totally nerfing the quest.  But to be realistic, I would recommend you NOT spend 1000gp on the portrait until the quest is active again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utormarctruelight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tormarc Truelight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(1/5/02 1:33:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3257.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Long Sword of Etheral Energy</span><hr size=1> I handed in my items and got no sword yesterday morning i was like WTF.. but had to log for work... so i log on after and petition saying it said it offers me the sword, i get faction and exp... NO SWORD anywhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
i was told buy a senior guide the log showed i only turned in 3 quest items and that was why i did not get a reward.. HELLO? you turn in ONE box hehe so bullshit,.... then the guide has me talk to the Lead GM. The lead Gm tells me that the item no longer exists and that is why i did not receive it.. i was like what??? all that time spent on getting the items and to get screwed like that.. so the item was not being generated after the patch the other day.. (lets be realistic it is a easy quest for a very good item).<br>
<br>
I told the GM that it was bullshit that it ate my items and that nothing could be done, i got angry.  he popped up in front of me i was expecting to get banned(phew i didnt get banned). Instead he messaged me about 15 minutes later and said after reviewing other sources he said the quest was screwed up in the patch. <br>
<br>
he gave me the box that you hand to the ghost. I was like WTF am i supposed to do with this, i need the four items to spawn the ghost. he then gave them to me and said to not try till after the next patch and to petition to see if the quest is working again.<br>
<br>
So if you collect the items right now, bank them till it gets fixed.<br>
