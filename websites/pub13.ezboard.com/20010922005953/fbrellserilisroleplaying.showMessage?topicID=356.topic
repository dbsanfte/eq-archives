It had been gathered by one Magil, a member of his guild the Violent Harvest. Magil had spend many weeks researching and compiling this data and, if it proved accurate, Zirrix would finally possess an item he had sought for some time. Zirrix did not usually desire to gather trinkets and babbles. He had neither the tolerance nor nature to hunt, re hunt, then hunt again, over and over, the same prey. But, he would perform quests, at least not those that were too long and tedious, to obtain certain items he wanted. In fact, the very quest he was on now had degraded into such a morass. It had become too time consuming and given far too much chance, thus did he turn his back upon it some time ago. But, with this new information at his disposal, he decided to yet again attempt to complete the tasks involved. The item he sought was of almost priceless value to a Warrior such as he. True, many sought the item, but only those not able to magically enhance their abilities actually needed it. What was worse, was that so many other parasitical, sniveling, weakling adventurers, who needed the assistance of their far higher skilled friends, also sought this item. Many who wanted it were not of high enough season to deserve it, or were too high and wanted it simply as a minor convenience. Those who actually had a need, and a fair chance of gaining the object through their own abilities, usually had to suffer the stench of the unworthy, inferior pests, who always seemed to gather around the searching of such quests like rats and flies at a corpse. Actually, the quest itself was not that difficult a one, and this first part was by far the most trying and time consuming aspect of it. <br>
<br>
Zirrix looked at the information again, and gauged the time by the setting sun. He stood outside the designated area and waited to see if the “trigger” would appear. He winced slightly because the supposed “trigger” was a member of the Undead. It was widely known as an established fact that a Teir’dal Warrior feared nothing. Zirrix was known to fear even less. But, when all was said and done, there was one thing that had always given him a certain feeling of “unease”. That was the Undead, in all it’s forms. Ever since he was a young Lieutenant in the Nektulos Legion, Zirrix had always avoided any duty regarding the Undead. Make no mistake, he could fight and destroy them with the same ruthless precision as any other threat to his person. But, given the option, he would just assume not engage them if he could avoid it. Maybe it was because he found the thought of being dragged back to the mortal realm in a rotting corpse, to wander with no purpose or honor across the land, to be so very chilling. Maybe it was the thought of being a decaying shambling slave to some conniving and devious Necromancer, to be so very repugnant. Whatever the deep reason within his soul, he just knew the sight of any Undead always made him “uncomfortable”. Now, here he stood in this burning, sun blasted desert, waiting for one to materialize. He had just finished this line of thought when, as if in answer to his summons, the fiend appeared. As the familiar and comforting feeling of battle lust and combat desire washed away the momentary “chill” that grasped it’s bony clawed hands at his heart, Zirrix launched himself at his target. The battle was over quickly, and as Zirrix turned his back on yet another destroyed enemy, he looked out into the desert. <br>
<br>
Scanning the horizon in the direction noted in the data, he saw that the information had proved to be true. Lumbering across the sandy dunes, was the unmistakable form of a green skinned Cyclops, as tall and powerful as one of the oldest of it’s race. Charging across the distance, Zirrix said a silent prayer of thanks to the Great God of Battle Rallos Zek, for casting his favor upon his faithful servant. The Teir’dal Warrior then reached the towering monstrosity and defeated it before any other roaming scavenger of a Caster could interfere. Tying the Ancient Cyclops’s ring, which was as large as a belt, to his backpack, Zirrix set off to find the next objective of the quest. Saying a silent word praise to the Dark Creator Innoruuk, Zirrix turned toward the Swamplands, and began his journey to the Shadowed Man camps of the Southern Kanarian Plains…<br>
<br>
OOC:<br>
     I already got the Jboots on the 4th, but I will still write up a few stories describing Zirrix’s travels as he goes through the quest. I hope you all enjoy them, thanks for reading.<br>
