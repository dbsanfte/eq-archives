Sitting in his study in the heart of Neriak, surrounded by ancient books and tomes of power. The queen mother has tasked all the heretics of Innoruuk to search, discover, and study; to unearth arcane magic from the forgotten continent of Kunark. Engrossed in deciphering a verse, the air in front of him shimmers then the beautiful vision of his love comes into focus. A message from her? How wonderful, though risky if found out. Before he can say a word she speaks quickly. “I am to marry another in the morrow, it is best for all. I am so sorry my sweet” and before he could formulate even a gasp as a response, the scrying pool disappears.<br>
<br>
Jumping to his feet knocking chair and table aside the scribes gathered in the room stare at him in shock. With disbelief in his eyes he ponders the background of the vision he just saw. The water the flame tower, yes he knew this place, the abode of the foul Aviak. As soon as his minds eye had formed the location his feet where already at a dead run. Sprinting past the tunnels and gates of the city forcing others to clear the way. And from one glance at the determination in his face, none offered resistance. Even a few house matrons had to stop to make way, there would be a price or punishment to be extracted for that, but of no concern he had to…What, stop the wedding? No nothing made sense. How could this be? I have to see her, this is impossible.<br>
<br>
Finally clearing the gates of the city, he felt the night chill ebbing and knew the sun would soon be up. He must hurry, as he summoned the enchantment of his boots and his feet started to move faster and faster. The countryside past through his mind as a blur. His mind running through the reasons that could have possibly led to this unbelievable course of events. He ran head long with reckless abandon, though few would dare to challenge his power.<br>
<br>
He arrived in time to see a host gathered around a ceremony. His love at the alter passing vows of devotion with a woodland elf. A user of earthly magic by his garb. How could this be, though the racial hatred of their land forced them apart he always knew there would be a time he could win her back, even if he had to raise an army of undead to dismantle the walls of Felwaithe one brick at a time to make it so. Feeling a knot in his stomach sending him to his knees in agony. As a tear runs down the side of his cheek, in an instant all the goodness, all the love and the influence being married to a Cleric had given him, has washed away. He feels his heart devour itself and leave a void. And in that moment Innoruuk plants a seed of hate. He stands confused, was this a vengeful trick of the Mother of All played on a dark necromancer who dared to soil one of her High Priestess or just Innoruuk having his fun. It did not matter, hatred and evil drew from his every fiber to feed the seed planted where his heart once was. Well if his life was to be rocked on its side because he is one to be feared and hated then that is what it shall be. <br>
<br>
When all the fair elf children wake in the middle of the night screaming from a nightmare in dread and fright, he wants to ensure his visage is the one thing holding them trembling. He will lay in wait at night and turn the land red with blood. And in his malice evoke his power to control his victim in death. To use the dead to reign ultimate terror in the land and to keep them damned and in eternal torment.<br>
<br>
Thus the cleric charmed pet spell is broken and begins the reign of terror of <br>
Terdal the destroyer. <br>
