Might be some repetitions, but it's easier than searching each page in that monster  <br>
<br>
20 Things every DAoC Newbie Should Know <br>
<br>
This is a list of things I've been developing during beta. Questions people have asked, or didn't know about. Please feel free to print, bump, add, re-post on other boards or burn it as you see fit. <br>
<br>
1) You can talk to an NPC by right clicking on them. If a dialog box pops up, and there is a bracketed, highlighted piece of text, then you can click on the highlighted text to continue the conversation. Your trainer should have a quest for your first few levels. You can find additional quests by talking to the town criers and bartenders and clicking on the word adventure in the dialog box. <br>
<br>
2) Use the T key to light your torch so you can see at night <br>
<br>
3) To stand, use jump, forward, backward (much easier then typing /stand). <br>
<br>
4) To see if someone is on line, what class and what level they are, type: <br>
/who xxx <br>
<br>
where xxx is their name or part of their name. Note that typing >/who wizard= will list all the wizards in the game. >/who= (no parameter) gives the total number of players in your realm. You can then use: <br>
/send xxx <br>
to send a message. For example, <br>
/send Merlin Hey, what=s up? <br>
would send a message to Merlin. <br>
<br>
5) To determine how tough a monster is, click on the monster. You will see their name and hit points in the bottom right panel (below your exp bubbles). The color of their names indicates how tough they are. Grey is easy (no exp, no loot), then green, blue, yellow (approximately your level), orange, red and purple (way above your level). Solo, you should be able to take on blue monsters, but yellows may be a little difficult. <br>
<br>
6) You will level faster in groups, especially after 5th level, provided the group knows what it is doing. To add someone to a group, click on the group button (top right, with three large dots). Select the player you want with the mouse and then click on invite. Grouping is great for experience, however soloing usually produces more money. <br>
<br>
7) Quality of equipment is important. Store bought equipment has a quality rating of 80%. This means it is 80% as efficient as 100% equipment. Quest items usually have a quality of 100%. Player crafted items have a quality of 90%-100%. Try and buy player made items when you can because it far exceeds store bought items. Equipment with lower values can be better then equipment with higher values if it is of good quality. <br>
<br>
8) Equipment uses the same color scheme monsters do (gray=low, purple=high). If you can keep your character in blue armor with some yellow thrown in on occasion, you are doing very well. Higher colored armor will degrade faster. <br>
<br>
<br>
9) You can get additional tasks by walking up to NPCs and typing >task=. Store merchants usually give delivery tasks, such as take an item to another NPC in a different town. Named guards give tasks to kill a specific type of monster. Trade Masters give tasks to make specific equipment and have it delivered. Typing /task at any time will list your current task. <br>
<br>
10) To quick sell items, right click on the vender to bring up the vendor dialog box, then click on the item you want to sell and press the quick sell key (default key is J). <br>
<br>
11) To make a macro, type: <br>
/macro xxx <br>
where xxx is the macro you want to use or text you want to type. You will then have a button attached to your mouse you can place on the quick bar. For example, <br>
/macro /dir <br>
will show the direction you are facing when you click on the /dir button. <br>
<br>
12) Common commands: <br>
/bind - set your bind location (the place you will return to after you die). <br>
/keyboard - show a list of keyboard commands <br>
/release - return to the last location you were bound at after you die <br>
/quit - quit the game (it will automatically make you sit, delayed 20 seconds) <br>
/pray - select your grave (after level 6) and use this to gain back some of the experience you lose when you die <br>
/dir - shows the direction you are facing <br>
/loc - your current coordinates, (note: this might be removed before release) <br>
/time - current time (game time) <br>
/played - shows RL hours spent with the character <br>
<br>
13) For in-game help, press F1. The on-line dynamic FAQ is at http://support.darkageofcamelot.com <br>
<br>
14) If you need advice or have a quick question, use /advice to find a list of people on the server that are willing to give you advice or answer your questions. After you find somebody you want to ask a question, use ‘/advice xxx question’ where xxx is their name. Feel free to ask these people questions, but remember, they are players and are not paid by Mythic. Before asking them, you should try and RTFM or try the FAQ listed in 13 above. If things get really bad, you can do a /petition to talk to a Customer Service Rep from Mythic. <br>
<br>
15) For trade skill information, go to the following link: <br>
http://cso.daoc.net/guides/tradeskill/ <br>
<br>
16) You can locate an NPC in the area you are in by clicking on a guard and typing: <br>
/where xxx <br>
where xxx is the name of the NPC. The guard will point in the direction and say the NPC is up, down, or in that direction. Take note of the up or down as it indicates if the NPC is upstairs or downstairs relative to your character. <br>
<br>
17) When you kill a quest monster, the item will be automatically placed in your inventory. If you are in a group and complete a quest, EVERYONE IN THE GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE QUEST ITEM WHEN IT DROPS if they had the quest. Please group with people to complete quests if others are working on it as well as it saves time for everyone. <br>
<br>
18) Use F6 to enter or exit combat mode. <br>
<br>
19) For an excellent web based character design/planner program, see this link: <br>
http://daoc.catacombs.com/cbuilder.cfm <br>
<br>
20) If you want to see if you are being chased, you can use F11 to lock the camera in place as your character runs into the distance, or you can press and hold the ~ key while using the directions keys to see what is around you. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Kill the crappy little skeletons that hang around the newbie start-up areas. Soloable at lvl 2, and they drop rawhide armor that's wearable (at no cost) until lvl 5. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Good idea. But here's a few additions/corrections. <br>
<br>
4) /tell is in the game now (or so the last patch message said). It has the same function as /send. <br>
<br>
9) There's a typo there, with /task. <br>
<br>
12) You can also type /d instead of /dir. <br>
<br>
Important note: If you /release, you cannot be ressurrected. <br>
<br>
If you type /bind while not near a bindstone, it will display your current bind point. <br>
<br>
And, /quit sometimes takes more than 20 seconds; most notably, when you have just finished a combat. <br>
<br>
Lastly, a tip from Bolrus: <br>
<br>
No matter what your class, the very first thing you should purchase is a new weapon. As quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Have fun. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Well I would say do tasks and quests for easy leveling. <br>
<br>
Upgrade your weapon immediately once you have a few silver. Toss away the practice weapon. <br>
<br>
Also get cheap armor and shields asap. <br>
<br>
Fight blue and green enemies for safe experience. <br>
<br>
Play solo for more cash and group for easy, safe experience. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
<br>
the 'C' key is mapped to make your sit or stand depending on your current state. It's a lot faster and easier then the /sit or /stand commands. <br>
<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
If you screw up and lose your practice weapon for some odd reason, you can get another one free from your trainer. <br>
<br>
Numlock by default is your autorun key. <br>
<br>
before pressing the PLAY button on the character screen, go to options and look/change the keyboard layout to your liking. For those coming from EQ, changing the mouselook(camera, forget what it's called) option to the right mouse button. I think the default is m. <br>
<br>
Upgrade to a bronze weapon ASAP. practice weapons are okay but you want a good weapon of the type you plan on training. It's a good idea to train 1 point (for the melee classes) in the weapon type of your choice (slashing, crushing/thrust) as soon as you get to level 2 so you can get the initial weapon style. this style typically adds 2 to 3 points of extra damage every time you use it (as long as your endurance holds out). <br>
<br>
Humanoid monsters (skeletons, zombies, goblins, etc.) tend to drop better loot, like pitted weapons, tattered armor and sometimes coin. Easy way to get that starter equipment. Go hunt those mobs when you can but don't ignore other easy mobs (they drop loot too). Getting the first 4 levels is easy. Concentrate on getting money for a better weapon and some decent armor. <br>
<br>
For casters, remember, until you get the quick cast skill, casting in combat is near impossible. So, target a blue or green con mob at maximum distance, nuke nuke nuke until it gets in to melee range and then melee it until you or it dies. You should still get a better weapon ASAP. Just like melees since your starter weapon sucks. <br>
<br>
For the first 5 levels, you don't lose anything when you die so, don't run if it gets dicey. You have nothing to lose and might win. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, the quickbar. You can delete buttons off of your quickbar by SHIFT + Right Clicking on the button. <br>
<br>
To rearrange buttons on the bar, pick up a button from your character sheet or make a macro button (i.e. /macro /stand). That will put a button on your cursor. Now you can rearrange the buttons on your quickbar without having to delete and replace the buttons. It works kinda like musical chairs, you move the buttons by replacing the button you want moved with the one your just made and then moving that button to the new spot you want, etc. etc. In the end, if you have a full bar, after you have rearranged the buttons you wanted to move, you should have that original button on your cursor. left click in the game window itself to "drop" that button and return the cursor to normal. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Agreeing with that fella further up, quick sell is Shift-S. Just click on the item and hit Shift-S. <br>
<br>
Also, in Albion, instead of buying a new weapon you can kill spriggarns till you get some flint. Hand that into a stonemason and you can get a new weapon (depending on the type of flint). Easy quest and the weapon will last you till your level 5 or so. <br>
<br>
The only problem is killing a spriggarn (which are around level 3 I think) with your crappy newbie weapon. Not easy for some classes =P <br>
<br>
Skellys, Zombies and other undead types may be good for equiping yourself with newbie armor and they drop a few coins. But ultimatly other baddies drop better selling loot. That armor will only sell for a few copper. Stuff like pelts, tusks, heads and skins sell for around 20 - 70 copper. <br>
<br>
And my last tip: Be cheap! Save every penny, silver, copper etc. You will need it. Especially if your a fighter class. <br>
<br>
(And for friars - you should be aiming at around 33 silver when you hit level 5. Thats for a good staff you can get in cotswold that should be yellow to you.) <br>
<br>
Hmm, I'm done. <br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
A few more points to make ... <br>
<br>
* When you create you character, don't put any more than 10 points in any one skill. You are penalized for each extra point added. <br>
<br>
* If you can afford it, keep a blunt weapon (as in mace) and a sword on you. Many of the mobs are protected against some types of weapons and/or take extra damage from a certain type. For example, skellies take extra damage from blunt weapons. You will see this as you hit them; (+#) or (-#) is put on each hit. <br>
<br>
* As mentioned, upgrade from your newbie weapon ASAP. This can't be stressed enough. It usually takes about 3-4 silver pieces to do this. <br>
<br>
* Don't allocate any of your skill points until you get to level 5 when you pick your final class. This way, if you change your mind on the class you want, you can do so without wasting points. <br>
<br>
* Make a hotkey for the Sprint Command ... everyone has this skill at level 1. It will allow you to outrun many of the mobs you encounter at the expense your Endurance. <br>
<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ <br>
<br>
Right click on each tab and make sure you turn the messages on for everything. Once you are comfortable, you can customize it a little, but A LOT of players were missing messages because they were on the wrong tab. <br>
<br>
