<br>
Regards my 30mins statement - nobody had been there for the past half hour; I'd been pulling from there while we were in the corner.  We said our piece and got no positive response.  /shrug.  To make a long story short - we ended up training ourselves immediately after this and left again for the right corner - no sense being 12 people being childish when 5 were doing just fine on their own.  Besides - there's a perfectly fine xp spot over in the right corner.  Tenr/Janfadar's group promptly moved to the recently vacated tower since it was &quot;theirs&quot;.  We moved to the RC and got xp regardless.  Really getting hard to keep playing this stupid game.<br>

I would very much like an opinion on what to do next time.<br>
<br>
We lead 2 groups to the king room in SolB for training exercises. Every other camp was taken, and this one did not show up in OOC.<br>
<br>
When we get there, a player is there and asks if we are passing through or staying. I say we are staying to practice. He says he is camping the king. After some minor discussion, we agree to take everything but the king.<br>
<br>
Fight around for 15 mins or so. then he says he is pulling the king. Fine, if you bring it near us, we will take the others.<br>
<br>
He comes up with the whole camp from below. After the fight is over, we look around and find he is dead.<br>
<br>
OK. So now he needs to get back. For the moment, we have the king spawn.<br>
<br>
When he returns (an hour later) he sends a message. I suggest he join us as a tank is leaving. (also during this time we had cleared the lower level again). Some confused tells (i was working with our groups). Think we ended up with join us or take the king alone- didn't matter either way.<br>
<br>
I get involved with my groups, and don't have the attention to keep track of what he is doing. <br>
<br>
/ooc camp check<br>
<br>
Someone in our party says King.<br>
<br>
The other player /ooc that we stole the king.<br>
<br>
This ensued into a heated argument. Basically he had a few choices: come and join our group, camp the king alone, or offer us a different alternative. This is much more than an hour since he died, and he wasn't here- i think we were right to say the spawn was taken.<br>
<br>
Based on his dying from the elites and the king, i don't see how he was planning on camping alone. The camp was not broken when we arrived.<br>
<br>
There is more to this story... but the relevant point i am interested in:<br>
<br>
1) How long do you keep rights to a spawn if you die (reasonably)<br>
<br>
2) Lets say the same person tried to take it again, and ran to the zone. Does he still have the spawn? How many times do you let him try? Let's also say, the other group was trained without warning and destroyed what attacked them.<br>
<br>
<br>
I will note that i was leading 2 groups, and wasn't really pay that much attention to the whole thing until the ooc starts. So there is certainly another side to this issue.<br>

That is how I would have done that scenario.  If your group is not complete because of deaths etc then you have the camp when your group reforms.  Until then others should be able to assume your position for a while.  If the reforming of your group takes too long then loot your corpses and get out for others.  That is the nature of the beast.<br>

The reasoning is simply to stop the bad feeling that could arise if there was actually a race for the spawn. On the other hand, if theres a full group with nothing to do at zone, and someone is claiming a spawn for over an hour while waiting on a vital group member this seriously needs a rethink <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's just a courtousy thing really.</font><P><table align=center>

LOL Jana if you are reading this bud you are way off base.  You leave the tower you lose the spawn.  No Cleric? if you can't cut it without one you lose the camp.<br>
<br>
On a side note I no longer call trains in Karnors, it's rediculous, train left and you can always see the trains comming.<br>

If you fight at the zone it's a risk you take.<br>

I agree, I think i was being WAY lenient. But then you never know who the person is, who they are connected to, etc...<br>
<br>
The person eventually came back with a 45 bard and claimed the spawn. After some more arguing (and a small aplogy to me in tell, NOT ooc where the accusation was made), they went down to take the king.<br>
<br>
10 minutes later, my group is medding. I am looking over the ledge and see the bard get cast on. The two of them run to the zone! Train over our unprepared groups. Holy cow, was i mad. Suffice to say, we killed everything, but lost one of our lowbies in the fight.<br>
<br>
The two come back, no comment, no sorry, nothing.... guess what? They reclaim the spawn!<br>
<br>
At this point we decided to just leave, we had been given the arch and preacher and that was fine.<br>
<br>
One side note. I believe a member of one of our parties pulled the king as we were leaving. He was a pick-up, not part of the guild group (he wasn't following orders). The two &quot;camping&quot; the king shouted KS. Yeah right. Go away.</font><P><IMG ALIGN=Left BORDER=0 SRC="http://www.prexus.com/harmonyofsouls/screenshots/koikeeperminime.gif">

You should've booted him out of the room.  It was pretty obvious he wasn't handling it.<br>
<br>
Of course, I have my own Sol B story...heh.<br>
<br>
A group of us were in the noble room a couple of weeks ago.  We'd thought about going up to the king room, and decided against it because a) we weren't sure we could handle it, and b) some other group was up there.  Running to the zone every 10 minutes.  For 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Anywho...<br>
<br>
About 2 hours into our noble camp, someone managed to run through with 2 LDCs and a noxious spider.  Yeah, a couple of us died.  Corpse recovery took an hour.  Yes, an hour.  A big part of the reason was that someone (who's name escapes me now) was running the KING around the zone.  I don't know if he wanted to take him on alone, if he was a member of the king group, or what he was doing.  All I know is, he managed to run myself and the other surviving group member out twice.<br>
<br>
Once all of our group got back together, corpses looted, equipment ready, etc., along comes the guy again, king still in tow.  We jumped it.<br>
<br>
One of the king members (who I'd adventured with the night before, he's a cool guy) said the king was theirs.  I said we knew that.  We also knew that this guy (who'd convieniently left) had been training the king to us for about an hour, so we finally had to take it down.<br>
<br>
Mind you, I'm not complaining.  That's how I got my first RMB.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
People claiming from the zone, people running mobs around, people taking things they can't handle and zoning every 3 or 5 or 10 minutes should all get to know their limits.  It all happens because some d00d wants the phat l3wt to look l33+ to the n00bies.<br>

<br>
Can I use that to make a general point - I'd suggest you decide the right thing to do and do it, regardless of who it is, so it doesn't matter? So, somoene who is unguilded with no power gets treated with respect and morality, and the powerful, well:<br>
<br>
If the powerful - the big guild leaders - are treated TOO well, i.e. any KS'ing cussgin rudeness sort of behaviors are not criticized because you don't want to get in trouble with them, the people who let them off the hook are making this a worse server, because it's human nature for them to start to think they deserve that treatment and demand it, if they get used to getting it. Then, the server is icky.<br>
<br>
Use the same rules for them - and the way they get their thanks for being big guild leaders is:<br>
<br>
- it's fun, its own reward<br>
- they get plenty of access to the fun raids and items<br>
- thank them sincerely. When I go on a raid I recognize the leader did a lot of work for that and I appreciate it.<br>
<br>
It does not mean that if he does something wrong I think needs correcting I willl not say so. For example, one of the more powerful guilds Keepers of the Faith:<br>
<br>
- one of their mid level guys marginally, arguably ks'ed my twink a bit. I told him and then he went out of his way to make up for it - what a great guy - and I made a point to publically praise him.<br>
- I've repeatedly praised the way they usually do things and how much fun I have playing with them on occassion. I disagreed with the action I saw on the raid calendar in an area - and criticized them for it.<br>
<br>
I think the server is healthier for people not to be made into primadonnas.<br>

To your point tho, i treat everyone the same (or try to), and the reason is the same. The guy that just KSed you may be a twink of someone else. I just tend to give the person the benefit of the doubt. I have seen people go off on a level 20 cause they think they can, only to have the person's level 50 primary come and give them problems.<br>
<br>
It is just a philosophy i have in business... Treat everyone respectfully. It will rarely hurt you to do so. And truth be told- you never know who the person really is, or who they are connected to. It may sound cynical, but the end result is the same- i treat everyone politely.<br>
<br>
Just ask Stormtower. We didn't meet on the best of circumstances. At the time i had no idea who he was. Now we are friends. Simply because i kept my cool, and didn't overeact.</font><P><IMG ALIGN=Left BORDER=0 SRC="http://www.prexus.com/harmonyofsouls/screenshots/koikeeperminime.gif">

Koi,<br>
It's nice to see that you play descently, it's definetly needed. My guild has been subjected to this crap very frequently of late in Karnor's and Guk. We will have one person who says that such and such is open. We form a group and get there some 30 min or more and then get hit with &quot;It's camped!&quot; after ooc's have gone unanswered asking for camp check. And the<br>
guy saying it's camped is standing right next to us at the zone, which is shortly followed by such and such looking for healer, chanter... whatever. I am getting very tired of this crap. We are there and ready to go and noone is at the spawn area, at that point I think it's first come first serve. Like other people have said if you can't control the spawn then you aren't camping it. <br>
