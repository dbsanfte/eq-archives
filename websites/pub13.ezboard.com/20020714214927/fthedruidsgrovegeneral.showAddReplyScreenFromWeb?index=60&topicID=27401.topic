Wise, you got any idea what kind of mana regen shamans got with the Canni line? Seriously? Anyone who suggest CH for shamans need to go talk to their local shaman about it and when he stopped rolling on the floor laughing about having CH and what he can do with it so can you talk some about mana regen...<br>
<br>
Now, lets move on. Something I keep seeing poping up is druids saying they can NOT heal good enough to keep random_player_01 in. Usually they compare themself to healing the MT (lets say 6.5k for a easy low number these days) or rampage/secondary MT (also at 6.5k hp). Now, on a raid with something rampaging (Archie, Rhag2, anything that wont be slowed and cripple wont land on/stay on) big time so will ONE druid not keep it up, I would even dare to say two druids would have a hard time (depending on the magic dice, defensive yada yada yada) to keep it up. I dont think anyone is going to question that either. The thing that seem to be the common mistake though is saying this is ONLY about high end raiding or everyone will end up in high end raiding only. That is false, you will all end up doing exp for the simple reason you want to regain those four deaths learning mr AoW ver. 2.0 that decided to stomp your raid a few times before you killed him. Any form of direct heal will impact the regular exping, lets not stick this under the chair.<br>
<br>
The story behind CH was that it was intended as a non combat healing spell (therefor the long casting time) and it was of limited use (though I CHed that 1500hp monk when I got it and though I was mana efficent, those where the days), as everything moved on so did the tanks HP and it became a corner stone to cleric healing. Well all know what happend etc etc. Now, CH is not a true complete heal (aka 100% heal of target), it is a 10k heal (10.5k with the 5% bonus). Not knowing what VI can and can not do so will I make a assumption that VI can NOT make a true % heal atm. They can only do a coded number heal (aka you heal for 5k not 50% of target etc) so does that leave a problem. How do you make a heal (and healing is what usually is brought up) that dont balance regular exping (where single druid can do the job in most zones, shamans in even more and the idea was that two of them where suppose to replace a cleric which is not the case today due to "insert random long list of caster complaints on mudflation") but still bring them in line on raids?<br>
<br>
Some druids say they want CH, I say take it so I can do something else then sit in the CH chain. Let the druids do that (;. I am willing to bet most druids will be coming screaming after you done that for half a year or so. There is hands down nothing as boring as sitting in a CH chain and 99% of all tactics is based on some form of CH chain... But then I want to be getting some real solo/group abilities in return so I can bring something to the other spectrum of the end. I dont think many clerics would turn down trading "raid power" to be less of a demand raiding wise (guilttrips etc is daily for many clerics if they simply not feel like raiding that night) for some more group/solo power. Where druids got very good solo/group power (guess this will be flamed and nitpicked by two sides, you can quadders and the we can quadd but class X do exp faster) but want more raiding power. I love if I instead of having to bring my cleric to the raid this night could bring out my ranger because instead because we had enough clerics for the core healing needed and got enough replacement druids to take up the slack in the other end.<br>
<br>
Humm, I guess that was rambeling enough (;<br>

<br>
Me too. Over the past year, I have been watching melee get more powerful simply by leveling. Basically melee damage is unresistable and unlimited, disciplines are unresistable, and disciplines and aaxp skills are automatic upon reaching the right levels. <br>
<br>
Casters damage is resistable, limited by mana, based on arbitrary drops of spells. Only aaxp skills are automatic though. The only caster with enough damage potential to play at the high end is wizard because VI has specifically given then criticals and unresistable spells. <br>
<br>
All other classes have been relegated to finding some sort of role supporting the MA. Shaman slow, chanters buff, druids buff, clerics chain cheal. <br>

<br>
your post just prove how balancing is hard to do ;-)<br>
<br>
In some sense i agree with you i dislike the large raid<br>
idea, but this way of playing is now how people do.<br>
<br>
At some point years ago verant did a mistake, they made most of the high end encounters undoable by a 6 people group. <br>
<br>
The second mistake was complete heal that as you mentionned was not introduced as a combat spell but as a downtime reducer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Post 50 the major problem is that challenging encounters<br>
are Metal based (which mean you need clerics and may be a cleric chain, and sometimes slow, and melee damage dealer).<br>
<br>
This is not the case in the pre 50 game. <br>
<br>
This problem affect all the non holy classes (tanks, hubrids, monks, enchanter shamen clerics)<br>
and mage wizzard and druids are in trouble. <br>
<br>
<br>
Verrant effort to make mage and wizzard more usefull in typical post 50 encounters is clear, even if i m not sure that<br>
i would be happy to trade my druid for a mage .<br>
<br>
The picture is very complex, but what i m sure is that Verrant will never be able to balance the post 50 game if they don't include CHeal, slow and haste in their equations.<br>
