<br>
<br>
Raff stumbled into the darkness of a dirty alley.  He put the bottle of wine he was carrying to his lips and drank heavily.  Something deep inside of him was trying to get his attention, trying to tell him what he had just done was wrong.  You didn’t have to kill the man – he did nothing wrong the voice said.  Why did you kill him?  Have you lost all compassion for life?  Raff ignored the voice, as he had for the last few years.  He’d become quite good at it, really, but of course, the alcohol helped, and he knew it.  He avoided that voice at all costs, because he knew as soon as he started to listen again, the memories would come back.<br>
<br>
And then the pain.  Always the pain was there, lurking beneath the alcohol, waiting for a weakness, waiting to return, to take control.  He drained the bottle in two more gulps and threw it against the stone wall of a nearby building.  The glass shattered, much to Raff’s satisfaction with a sharp pop followed by a tinkle of glass fragments.  Somewhere nearby, Raff heard a low moan coming from another just like him.  Tonight he’d be sleeping in an alley as well, but he didn’t feel like closing his eyes just yet.<br>
<br>
He undid his breaches and began to relieve himself against the same wall he’d thrown the bottle at.  He watched as his urine flowed down the wall and mixed with the broken glass like a river finding it’s way among boulders.  There was something satisfying in the sight.  It was a bizarre circle, he thought.  The bottle, now broken, had once contained the liquid which he now returned to the bottle.  Somehow it was fitting.<br>
<br>
He finished and pulled up his breaches, turned and started down the alley.  Soon the guards would come, and they’d be looking for a murderer, but Raff was in no hurry.  Jail would be an odd sort of comfort to him, he thought. And should they execute him for his crimes, death would be even more welcome.  He didn’t really care one way or the other.  Death, life, jail, torture, punishment.  Nothing had meaning to him, nothing seemed important.  What was there to live for anyway?  Life was pain.  How could death be any worse?<br>
<br>
He entered the street at the end of the alley, walked across it, and found another alley.  The city was remarkably silent, even for the time.  Freeport rarely went completely to sleep.  The eerie silence was emphasized by a thick mist which had fallen down on the sleeping city a few moments after he left the bar.  The mist had seemed to thicken with each step he took, and now it was difficult to see more than a few feet in front of him.  He held his hand up, and even it seemed to fade away into the mist.  It was like being inside a thick cloud.  <br>
<br>
Realizing he couldn’t go much further, Raff decided this part of the alley was as good as any other part.  He leaned his back against a wall and allowed his body to slide slowly down it until he was sitting at the base.  There was a chill in the air, so he pulled his cloak closely around his body.  The cold stone of the street felt uncomfortable through a haze of drunkenness, and Raff was shivering a few minutes later.  He curled himself into a tight ball, lay on his side, and closed his eyes.<br>
<br>
Unbidden, the image of Glorias formed inside his eyelids, and he shut them tighter to escape from them.  Every night for the last four years he had gone to sleep with his wife’s face in his mind, and every night, for the last four years, his dreams had been filled with her beauty.  Every night, as he slept, the same dream would replay itself.  It would be slightly altered, but it always started the same way.  And it always ended the same way too. Glorias would be with Raff, laughing; her beautiful face would bring a smile to his face, even while he slept.  He would be happy, deliriously happy.  Some nights they were together in their inn.  Other nights they would be on a picnic, or out for a stroll, or even a play in the city.  But the worst dreams, by far, were the ones where his son was with them, playing on a beach, running through a green field, or laughing with his family.<br>
<br>
Regardless of how the dreams began, or where they took place, the endings were always the same.  Raff would wake suddenly, a desperate shout issuing from his lungs, as he saw his family murdered before him by a group of orcs.  In every dream he relived the horror of that night so long ago.  Every night he relived the pain.  He hated the night, but even more, he hated sleep.  Sometimes when he drank enough, the dreams would be muted, and the nightmare less real, but regardless of his efforts to drown himself in alcohol, they would still come, one way or another.<br>
<br>
He shivered in the mist, his chest tight as the emotions he would not allow himself to feel gnawed at their cages, threatening to come forth and claim him.  He wouldn’t cry.  He would not allow himself to give in to the pain.  For him, the depths of despair and loneliness created by the bottle were far more desirable than the emotions he kept locked inside his heart.  He shivered as much from the cold as from his mental exertions.<br>
<br>
“It hurts, doesn’t it”<br>
<br>
Raff snapped out of his delirium and sat upright instantly.  He’d been expecting to hear the footsteps of a guard at any time, and even though he often thought death or imprisonment would be better than his present life, his self-preservation instincts were as strong as ever.  His right hand searched the paving stones for a weapon to use on the guard.  His eyes searched the mist, but found nothing to focus on, only the amorphous swirling of white cotton.<br>
<br>
“I said, it hurts doesn’t it?” the voice questioned again.  This time Raff could tell it was coming directly in front of him, but the mist made it impossible to see anything.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?” Raff spoke, his voice cracking slightly.  His hand found a small piece of wood, and he grasped it firmly.<br>
<br>
“I’m a friend,” the voice responded soothingly.  “I’m here to help, Raff.”  A faint figure began to coalesce out of the mist, moving slowly toward the man shivering on the ground.<br>
<br>
Raff licked his lips and pulled the wooden club close to his body.  He hoped that a surprise attack might save him from a jail cell.  “I don’t need any help, but if you don’t bugger off, I’ll see that you need some help yourself” he said, trying to sound as menacing as he could.  Given that he was shivering on cold stone in a deserted alleyway, he didn’t think he sounded as menacing as he wanted to.<br>
<br>
“Oh yes Raff, you do.”  The figure moved forward and squatted down in front of Raff casually, his movements fluid and graceful.  “You’re not willing to admit it, but you need help, and I’m the only one who can help you.  I’m the only one, Raff, who can take the pain away.”<br>
<br>
The voice was so soothing and calming that Raff let go of his wooden weapon and slowly put his arms around himself in a futile attempt to keep himself warm.  He shivered and stared at the owner of the voice.  He was unmistakably dark elf.  His white hair flowed over his dark blue skin like freshly fallen snow and framed a face so beautiful Raff was almost unable to breathe as he looked upon it.  His clothes were woven out of silver and gold, and would have looked absurd on almost any other creature, but somehow they seemed somehow appropriate for this male elf.  His dark lips were turned up in a captivating smile, and his voice was like liquid honey.<br>
<br>
“Raff, I can change your world. I can restore you to the position you deserve.  I can answer all your prayers, all your dreams.”  The voice pulled to him, called to him.  It drove a feeling of peace through him, deep into his soul.<br>
<br>
“What in hell can you do for me, Teir’Dal?”  Raff tried again to sound fierce, but failed miserably.  His intonation made his words sound more like an apology than a threat.<br>
<br>
“I can give you what you want, Raff.  What you need.”  The dark elf continued, every syllable of his speech was like an analgesic to Raff.  Every word brought relief from the pain he felt.  “What is it you want most in this world Raff?  Don’t be afraid to ask me.  That’s what I’m here for.”<br>
<br>
Raff almost moaned despite his efforts to the contrary when the voice stopped.  The voice was heavenly, it was beauty itself.  He needed to hear more.  “I don’t know what you mean” he whispered falteringly.  “I… I want nothing, I need nothing.”<br>
<br>
“Oh, but Raff, that isn’t true, now is it?  Let your fear go Raff.  With me, anything is possible.  Anything.  All you have to do is ask.”<br>
<br>
Raff stared into the dark red eyes before him and felt himself being pulled into their depths.  He felt as if he wasn’t really alive, like he was floating through a cloud, weightless.  He was a breath of wind, light laughter in the air.  He tried to speak, but couldn’t find the words, or the energy to do so.  He wanted to hear the voice again, but didn’t have the will to answer.<br>
<br>
“Let me show you Raff.  Let me show you what can be yours again.”<br>
<br>
Raff’s mind exploded in white and he cried out in surprise.  He couldn’t see anything through his open eyes.  He looked around frantically, trying to find something to focus on.  Then from the whiteness a scene started to unfold itself.  He was in a building of some sort.  The walls seemed to fade in from the white background.  In front of him was the counter where he had once admitted guests.  He looked down to see the guest book, open in front of him.  In his hand he felt a quill, and he noticed a jar of ink just to his right.<br>
<br>
He dabbed the quill into the ink and began to write in the book.  The scene continued to evolve in front of him.  His wife soon stepped out from a room to the right and approached him, her arms open to embrace him.  She was wearing a white apron, and her hair was tied back in a neat bun.  She smiled warmly and pulled Raff close to herself.  Raff melted into her arms, dropping the quill.  It slowly fluttered to the floor and made a small glob of ink where it landed.<br>
<br>
“Glorias, I’ve missed you so much” Raff spoke quietly, his voice choked with tears.<br>
<br>
“Oh sweetheart, don’t be silly. I was just in the next room”.  She smiled brightly and kissed Raff lightly on his cheek, oblivious to his distress.  “Now, are you going to help me finish painting the nursery, or stare at that book all day?”<br>
<br>
Raff pulled back and looked at his wife.  She was at least 7 months pregnant.  His mind whirled.  She’s not dead then Raff thought to himself.  The orcs… what happened?  He put a hand to his temple and rubbed absently.  Glorias took his other hand in hers and pulled him across the room.<br>
<br>
“Come on silly, we have to finish the room.  Raff junior won’t wait for us” she laughed.  Raff followed her dumbly, as she pulled him gently across the room.  Something wasn’t right, he thought.  But what was it?  He tried to think.  Something about orcs, he thought.  By the time Glorias had lead him to the nursery, he’d forgotten what he was thinking about.  He gave a mental shrug, thinking it would come to him, and it wasn’t important anyway.  <br>
<br>
Together they started to paint the room.  Glorias has chosen a bright blue colour.  She said it was appropriate for a baby boy, and Raff agreed.  They painted for nearly an hour, while Glorias chatted about the kind of clothes she had been making for their son and how cute he’d look in the booties she’d knitted.  Occasionally they’d stop painting and embrace, sharing a quick kiss with each other and professing their love in each other’s arms.  As they finished their painting and were putting away the brushes and rags, Raff thought to himself how wonderful his life was, and how lucky he was to be so happy.  He went to kiss Glorias another time while she was wiping paint off her hand.<br>
<br>
The image before Raff shattered like breaking glass.  A blast of whiteness seared into his eyes, and he fell forward to the ground.  The smells of garbage and human excrement assaulted him as his vision returned.  He moved the palm of his hand along the cobblestone of the Freeport street.  A moment later he realized where he was, and reality forced itself upon him like an angry bully.<br>
<br>
“No” he whispered.  “No… please”.  He began to cry.  Sobs erupted uncontrollably from his lungs and he wailed like a newborn.  Tears streamed from his closed eyes and he screamed in agony.  He pounded his fists against the stones of the street until the pain finally registered.  “You bastard,” he sobbed. “Why did you do that to me?  Why!”.  <br>
Somewhere off in the distance, their voice muted by the city buildings, a voice shouted “Get up ya damn fool!”.<br>
<br>
The dark elf watched Raff cry until he’d calmed down enough to hear him speak. “I just wanted to show you how it could have been, Raff.” The dark elf purred.  “I know it hurt, but you can have it back, Raff. It can be yours to reclaim.  That bitch Erollisi took her from you.  But you can have her back!  You can have your life back.  And only I can help you.  That’s what I’m here for.”<br>
<br>
Raff wiped tears from his eyes with the sleeve of his shirt and slowly got to his knees.  He looked into the thick mist surrounding them for a while.  Wearily he stood up, and looked directly at the elf.<br>
<br>
“What do I have to do?” Raff asked quietly.<br>
<br>
The elf smiled confidently and put a dark blue hand on Raff’s shoulder.  “That, my dear friend, is exactly what I’m here to discuss.”<br>
