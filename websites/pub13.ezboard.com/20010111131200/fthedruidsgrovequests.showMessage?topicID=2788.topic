Quest Starts with Telin<br>
Darkforest in Burning Woods.His just west near the Skyfire zone<br>
along the zone wall.<br>
You need high Kelethin Ranger Faction (<br>
Faydark Champions)to get a response from hails.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 10:<br>
47:34]You say, 'hail Telin Darkforest'<br>
[Sep 20 10:47:35] Telin<br>
Darkforest looks at you serenely. 'Hello, wanderer.' <br>
[Sep 20<br>
10:48:02] You say, 'what are you doing in this forest?'<br>
[Sep<br>
20 10:48:03] Telin Darkforest says 'Mighty thisplace must have<br>
been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering.I have been<br>
sent here seeking answers to problems not yetunderstood. <br>
[<br>
Sep 20 10:48:18] You say, 'what answers?'<br>
[Sep 20 10:48:18]<br>
Telin Darkforest considers you fora few moments before speaking.<br>
'A great evil walks acrossthe land. The hand of some demon we<br>
don't yet know is twistingand polluting forests.' <br>
[Sep 20<br>
10:48:35] You say, 'what evil?'<br>
[Sep 20 10:48:35] Telin Darkforest<br>
says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers.<br>
Iwould be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect<br>
much but know little. <br>
[Sep 20 10:49:06] You say, 'whatdo you<br>
suspect?'<br>
[Sep 20 10:49:06] Telin Darkforest looksat you and<br>
sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, largeand small, have<br>
turned upon those who watched over them.Druids and rangers,<br>
worshippers of both Karana and Tunare,have reported a feeling<br>
of hatred throughout their once peacefullands.' <br>
[Sep 20 10:<br>
50:26] You say, 'What of Innoruuk?'<br>
[Sep 20 10:50:26] Telin<br>
Darkforest raises his eyebrowslightly and a subtle look of surprise<br>
creeps across hisface. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be.<br>
Perhaps I knewand didn't want to consider the possibility. It<br>
must be thisthough, and some action will have to be taken.'<br>
<br>
[Sep20 10:50:44] You say, 'what action'<br>
[Sep 20 10:50:44]<br>
Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles<br>
something quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful<br>
enough. Perhaps you can help those who seek to protect nature'<br>
s peace. Take this note. Deliver it only into the handsof Faelin<br>
Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, I cannot say.She is a friend<br>
of mine and a wanderer. She has been seenfrom one end of the<br>
lands to the other. Seek her out, andquickly.' <br>
<br>
You receive<br>
&quot;A Note&quot; from him<br>
<br>
Go find Faelin Bloodbriar just<br>
west of Kelethinnear Crushbone cave. She paths sometimes under<br>
the worldand runs real fast. Give her the Note.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 11:<br>
25:50] Faelin Bloodbriar reads the note carefully and growls<br>
to herself. 'Bad news, eh? Take this ring. There is one elf,<br>
dark elf even, who we must go to in order to gather insightinto<br>
Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he goes by most commonly.Kithicor<br>
seems to be his favorite haunt and most likely youwill find<br>
him there. Don't ask how I know him. Just takethe ring as my<br>
sign to him and he will speak to you. We don't need to speak<br>
again, so dont seek me out, just goto Telin.I must leave to<br>
investigate these events.' <br>
<br>
Youreceive &quot;A Ring&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Go to Kithicor Woodsand Find Giz T'xxx and give him the<br>
Ring. A level 50 Tier'Dal Reaver will spawn immediately and try<br>
to kill you butyou can just run.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 11:42:34] Giz X`<br>
Tin flipsyou a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems<br>
we havea mutual 'acquaintance.' The coin repays an old debt.<br>
Youdon't have to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk<br>
has informed me of your coming and your desires. Fortunately,<br>
I have all the answers you require right here at the endof my<br>
friend's blade. I think I'll be paying my old 'friend'a visit.<br>
' <br>
[Sep 20 11:42:34] Teir`Dal Reaver says 'LordInnoruuk, I<br>
have failed you. Forgive me and spare me fromservice to your<br>
undead minions in the world! <br>
<br>
Youreceive &quot;A Dark Metal<br>
Coin&quot;<br>
<br>
Return toBurning Woods and Give Telin the coin.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sep 2014:06:04] Telin Darkforest scratches the coin as<br>
he looksat it. 'Faelin sent you to Giz? Surprising. This coin<br>
speaksto the outcome of your talk. He would hardly give this<br>
bitof metal to a stranger, but that's a story for a different<br>
time. So, you say Giz did confirm Innoruuk's involvement, and<br>
something about undead minions? Here, take this coin back.Find<br>
Arch Druid Althele in the Karanas and show her that.Tell her<br>
what we have discussed. She will look kindly onan ally in this<br>
matter.' <br>
<br>
You receive &quot;A WornMetal Coin&quot;<br>
<br>
Go<br>
to East Karana along the southshore near the barb village. You'<br>
ll find a level 60 druidAlthele. Give her the coin.<br>
<br>
[Sep<br>
20 14:25:48] Althelelooks at the coin and nods gravely at you<br>
as she slips itinto a fold of her clothing. 'I see. The story<br>
of this coinspeaks much to me as do the words you have given<br>
me. Telinsent word that you would arrive. The tidings you bring<br>
areill indeed. Here, take this amulet and find Sionae. She is<br>
nearby. We will speak more on this matter when all are present.<br>
' <br>
<br>
You receive &quot;A Amulet&quot;. Find Sionaein the zone<br>
and give her the amulet.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:28:54] Sionae says 'I<br>
see that the time has come. Take theamulet and give it to the<br>
third of our kin, Nuien. I willmeet you at the gathering. <br>
<br>
<br>
You receive &quot;AWorn Amulet&quot;. Find Nuien in the zone<br>
and give him theamulet.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:48:03] Nuien says 'So<br>
be it.Do as you have done before and find the next. Teloa is<br>
thelast. <br>
<br>
You receive &quot;A Worn Amulet&quot;. Find Teloa<br>
in the zone and make sure you have friends with you and give<br>
her the amulet.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:52:20] Teloa begins walkingtoward<br>
the gathering spot. 'Follow, friend. Hold that amuletfor yourself<br>
for the time being.' <br>
<br>
You receive &quot;A Worn Amulet&quot;<br>
. <br>
<br>
Go back to Althele andwait a bit for a Dark Elf Corruptor<br>
and pals to spawn.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51] Althele says 'Great mother<br>
of lifeand father of sky, growth and spirit, Tunare and Karana.<br>
Innoruuk once again schemes and we have failed in our duties<br>
to protect our land. We give our powers in sacrifice foryour<br>
help. Heed our call and send us your wisdom. <br>
[Sep20 14:53:<br>
51] Teloa begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51] Teloa breathes<br>
slowly as tendrils of power emanatefrom her body and race along<br>
the ground. <br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51] Nuien begins to cast a spell.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51]Nuien growls as his power seeps into the<br>
earth. <br>
[Sep20 14:53:51] Sionae begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Sep<br>
20 14:53:51] Sionae shivers as her power flows into the air above<br>
the gathering. <br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51] Tholris begins to casta spell.<br>
<br>
[Sep 20 14:53:51] Tholris breathes quicklyand sweats as he<br>
channels his spirit into the sky. <br>
[Sep 20 14:54:05] Althele<br>
snaps her head towards you. 'Innoruuk's brood is upon us. Go,<br>
find the spawn of hatred before theyreach this point and destroy<br>
them!' <br>
[Sep 20 14:54:05]Dark Elf Corruptor shouts 'We come<br>
for you, fools. Your reignof weakness over the powers of the<br>
land comes to an end now!<br>
<br>
You must kill the Dark Elf Corruptor<br>
before hedespawns or approaches the druids. Loot a tome off<br>
him. Goback to Althele and give her the tome.<br>
<br>
[Sep 21 19:<br>
06:39] Althele hands the book to Tholris who reads through it<br>
with lines of concern etched on his face, then whispers into<br>
her ear. 'Dire news, indeed. This cannot be allowed. I mustkeep<br>
this book but you, Camili , must not allow Innoruuk,to seed<br>
the land with his hatred and filth. You have onlyjust begun<br>
your quest. The path you are guided upon willbe difficult, if<br>
not impossible, but someone must finishit. Please, take this,<br>
read of it, follow its instructions.Tunare bless your path and<br>
Karana watch over you.' <br>
'We cannot speak again. Our circle<br>
is now known and must seeksanctuary. In case this note were<br>
to fall into others’ hands.I cannot tell you plainly the next<br>
steps of your task. AllI can say is to seek she who walks the<br>
path of the mother,she who walks the lands in service to her<br>
kin. Give her thisnote and she will know'<br>
<br>
You receive &quot;<br>
A EarthStained Note&quot;<br>
<br>
Go to Misty Thicket and hand the<br>
note to Ella Foodcrafter. Make sure you have a empty invslot<br>
available first.<br>
<br>
[Sep 21 21:20:25 2000] EllaFoodcrafter says<br>
'Hmmm. I've been waiting for someone tobring me this. I'm sorry<br>
such a young one as you has takenup this task. Maybe the sky<br>
god blesses ya though. Aye, yahave that look in your eye. Our<br>
task is to focus the blessingsof the gods and cleanse the filth<br>
from the land. I'll needtwo things from ya. <br>
[Sep 21 21:20:<br>
47 2000] You say,'what two things?'<br>
[Sep 21 21:20:48 2000]<br>
Ella Foodcraftersays 'Well, ya ask before ya act. That's a good<br>
sign. WhatI need isn't easy to find. First, I need a mixture.<br>
Plainsounding enough but it's a special one. Cleanses the mind<br>
and focuses the earth's energies into a forest walker's mind.<br>
I don't know how to make it. I don't even know what it'scalled.<br>
I merely know it exists and we'll be needing it forour task.<br>
When ya do find how to make it ya can mix it inthat bowl. Keep<br>
it when youre done, it's a good bowl.<br>
&lt;Unconfirmed on TEST&amp;<br>
gt;<br>
[Sep 21 21:20:48 2000]Ella foodcrafter grins &quot;good<br>
ya didnt run off withoutfinding out what else ya need to do.<br>
Second, i need a specialtype of bowl. A ancient type of bowl<br>
which strenghened thefood placed inside it, once made by the<br>
elves of old. Againi can not tell ya how it is made for the<br>
making was lostto the ages. seek the knowledge and these items<br>
out in thelands come to me when you have found both.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The first item is a Hardened Mixture which consists of the<br>
following foraged items:<br>
Heartfruit from Greater Faydwer<br>
Molded<br>
speckled Mushroom from Innothule Swamp<br>
FrozenTundra root from<br>
Everfrost<br>
Sweetened Mudroots from MistyThicket<br>
<br>
Combine in<br>
bowl and you get a &quot;HardendMixture&quot;<br>

52:32 2000] Alrik Farsight says 'Ah.  Hello there, adventurer.<br>
Come to search for ancient artifacts with Fizzlebik andmyself?<br>
<br>

bowl'<br>
[Tue Oct 03 02:52:35 2000]Alrik Farsight   rummages through<br>
his tattered bag and throwsaside a towel.  'Too many towels.<br>
Oh well, someone told methey were good to have once.  Here it<br>
is, a bowl pattern.Interesting bowl.  Looks almost like a magical<br>
bowl but I'm no potter.  You need it, you say?  Well, it is interesting<br>
.  Part of my research here is for the wizard guild in Felwithe.<br>
I'm sure they'd put a high price on this one, the enchanters<br>
guild being so interested in trading for magical paraphernalia<br>
and all.  Of course if<br>
[Tue Oct 03 02:52:36 2000]  youhelped<br>
me out on a chore I have, I'd be happy to give itto you.  I<br>
need to deliver an artifact to the guild and I'd much rather<br>
stay here exploring.  If you wish, you cantake the artifact<br>
and return with the receipt and I'll giveyou the pattern.' <br>

earthen pot?  Why in the nine hells would I need a crushedpot?<br>
Perhaps I could use it to not hold water!  Why did youeven bother<br>
me with this?  Are you mentally deficient?  Apparently.Oh,<br>
well, you're just a servant boy.  Well, then, we'll makeyou<br>
useful, if just a little.  Take this shopping list andgo get<br>
my groceries.  Take it to Nora in the tavern.  She'll know what<br>
I need. <br>

Go to Felwithe<br>
North and give list to MerchantNora<br>
<br>

2000] Merchant Nora says'You hardly look like the type of errand<br>

they are.  I hopehe chokes on them.  Oh, and tell him he still<br>
owes me fivegold for his last order! <br>

[Tue Oct 03 03:11:<br>
582000] Alrik Farsight   grins happily.  'Excellent!  Was he<br>
pleased with the artifact?  Oh, that's not even worth answering.<br>
I'm sure he was.  He's always happy with the things I sendhim.<br>
That's why he honored me with this position of esteem,searching<br>

You say, 'Who is Niera?'<br>
Merdan Fleetfootblushes. 'She is,<br>
uh.. I don't know. I havent been able tospeak with her. She<br>
has many suitors, and I'm just anotherpoor ranger. I spend my<br>
days here pretending to fish, tocarve bows, but really I'm just<br>
waiting to catch a glimpseof her. I thought about adventuring<br>

<br>
Hardened Mi(x)ture, (11 spaces)iea, (5 spaces) Platinum Speckled Powder, Enchanted Clay, this(7 spaces) pattern.<br>
<br>
I know it isn't much, but it solves why the foraged items were needed and ties in as well as gives us one more item that we know is needed for the bowl.<br>
<br>
Conjecture - the only item/ mob in game that i know of with &quot;iea&quot; in it is Scoriea, but there is spells, mobs, items with that name.  none that i have seen are lore/no drop.  somewhere, there is and we just have yet to find it.<br>

my apologies if this is somewhere else.   I looked through some other threads, but couldn't locate my answer.<br>
<br>
<br>
In the part where you take the old painting to the human skeleton in the Frontier Mountains, where does this skeleton appear?<br>
<br>
I looked all over the Mountains last night, but could not find him.    Is it always there, or is it something that only appears every so often?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, as I was doing this part, I wondered what clue that Niera gave to prompt one to go to the Frontier Mountains?   Did someone just happen upon this?<br>

It's almost impossible to find it on tracking with all the trash in the zone. Easier if you get a SK, Necro or Cleric and have them cast Sense Undead.<br>
<br>
As for giving the painting.. It was a pretty good educated guess. Niera has powder and won't give it up because it reminds her of her mother. Her mom is dead and you have a painting of Niera, so you gotta give the painting to her dead mom somewhere..<br>

I once heard a report she was at the spires, but she ran before I could reach her.  Anyone have anymore details as to her spawn/despawn times and maybe some tips for catching her?<br>

My question concerns the DE Corruptor in EK, in the opening post for this thread it states that one should bring friends to kill the corruptor, I've also read in other threads that the corruptor despawns extremely fast.  I'm a level 50 druid and have done everything that I can so far solo (have my cleansed spirit of antonica and working on the opener to the entire quest now), just how tough is this corruptor in EK and how many friends do I need to bring along? Also, has the spawn/despawn thing been fixed with the corruptor?<br>
<br>
thanks in advance,<br>

I tracked him on several occasions in this 'path' to the southwest corner of the zone, where he keeps going up the wall until it tosses him back into the zone i think. <br>
<br>
It usually easy to find him on regular track if you are in the SW part of the zone ( in the giant cycle area for those who do named spawns ).<br>
