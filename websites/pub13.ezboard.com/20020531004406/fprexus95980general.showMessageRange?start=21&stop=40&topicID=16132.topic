<br>
The rationalization of moral equivalency by some I am seeing in this thread is really a sad thing. Wake the hell up. There can be no peace when one sides real goal is nothing less than the destruction of the other.<br>
<br>
The current leadership of the palestinian side has done nothing but bide their time for decades while steadily indoctrinating their children towards a singular goal. At the same time making as many children as possible to cynically use the pressure of a population bomb. Every action taken is designed towards one end and leaves no other alternatives open. They do not want to live side by side with a Jewish state. The Arab nations have tried three times (so far) to speed things up and got their asses handed to them.<br>
<br>
The only things that will change the situation of stalemate is another all-out war, a collapse of will, or some epiphany for the current leaders or, (more likely) a change of leadership on both sides. When Arafat is finally gone maybe a truly remarkable new leader will step up who will read the writing on the wall and end the misery. Sharon will probably have to go to because he would be too used to the old tactics and not likely to trust anything. But with the situation as it is now he is probably the right leader.<br>
<br>
Dont hold your breathe though for some Jeffersonian figure to appear out of that cesspool of ignorance, delusion, and culture of death known as the Islamic world. (mostly Arab) There was a time centuries ago where they were at the pinnacle of civilization with the most advanced science and scholarship and were the most enlightened people in the world. But they deteriorated and never adapted. Without the liguid gold found literally under their feet they would have virtually no economies at all. They have squandered untold wealth and some day those wells will start to give out.<br>
<br>
The west finally caught up with early Islam then overtook it and hasn't looked back while that culture rots in stagnation while pining about lost glorys. They will never have that success until they embrace the simple truths of freedom, liberty and democracy.<br>
<br>
The failure of the Islamic world to modernize has two very convenient scapegoats. They are (1) the most successful example of a philosophy in practice opposite to their own (the United States); and (2) the nearest (Israel).<br>
<br>
The specifics of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict have many added complications but the Arab world has been using the Palestinians as excellent pawns for decades that turn restless and resentful eyes away from the root problems.<br>

That it is not an acceptable from of protest to target and murder civilians to further your message?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, there are at least a couple of reasons.<br>
<br>
One is that so many see terrorism as justified when their side needs to use it. I've read that the people who wanted to create Israel in the late 40's committed terrorism to fight the arabs in power. And really, who wouldn't use terrorism if you felt the way the Palastenians feel - see the people on this board who cried out for nuking the middle east 9/11.<br>
<br>
The other is when you get into the feud mentality - you do bad because the other side did bad because you did bad...<br>
<br>
So Israle justifes bad on the Palestinian bombings who justify the bombings on Israel's killing of Palastenians and so on.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it's more than likely that for peace the region will need an outside force to push it. If either side has an advantage they seem determined to use it against the other, and if they are not at an advantage, their seems to be a stalemate of aggresion.<br>
<br>
So, let's get some separation and plan in place for keeping them apart as much as possible, and for sharing the spots that are essential to be shared. If Berlin could be split between US and Russia in the cold war, then why can't we find a share system for Jerusalem. And it may require the US threatening each side to cooperate (threatening in terms of not intervening on either side's behalf if they won't cooperate, so Israel faces the loss of support and Arabs the loss of our keeping a leash on Israel.)<br>
<br>
There's a lot to figure out - and the possession of nukes by Israel complicates things further.<br>
<br>
But ultimately there are common interests in peace, and hatred is only as old as a generation - look how far we've come on racism in 50 years, look how differently Japan and Germany get along now with neighbors; China and Japan are old enemies but have found ways to co-exist nowadays... <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

<br>
When I see a phrase like that, it seems so loaded with rhetoric it raises concerns.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it too often is from a side I can largely agree with, but seems to be a cliche they often buy into and stop seeing both sides of an issue. For example, yes, 'moral and cultural equivalence' can be a fallacy.<br>
<br>
The US both has some double standards for its behavior - and also justifies them much of the time. For example, our invasion of Panama to get Noriega set some dangerous precedents, and could easily have been a cover story for what was really a power play, but it wasn't, we really were removing a pretty bad guy for pretty good reasons.<br>
<br>
So no, we don't have to pretend the terrorists in the Arab community are the 'moral equivalents' of their victims. Yet that's only half the story. Why is it that so many who will make that point won't see the other side, how arabs are treated?<br>
<br>
Even regarding the 9/11 attack, a main reason cited was the US policy that has - if you believe some reports - killed 100,000 pretty innocent Iraqis, for some impact on Saddam. Well, where is the concern for the 100,000; where is the analysis of the benefits of the policy to see if it justifes the casualties?<br>
<br>
You can find the analayis - if you look deep into foreign policy writings, but few do. Those 100,000 are perhaps immoraly invisible to us. And that's part of the big picture. Since few really know the benefits of that policy, assume the 100,000 are not justified; where is our accountability, put next to the many fewer killed on 9/11, or by either arabs or Israel lately?<br>
<br>
It's food for thought, not a conclusion; luckily, our government usually has pretty good reasons for its actions, but it's not good how unaware the people who make up our citizens are on the issues, leaving open too much room for bad policies. <p>Arch Mage 60, Master of the epic elemental magics, collector of robes<BR>

Surprise, surprise, Ol' Saddam largely ignored the needs of his people and has spent the money on building his military and replacing his presidential palaces. He prefers spending it on cronies and supporting militant Islam around the world and enjoying the propaganda value of reports of &quot;100,000 deaths from sanctions&quot; that sympathetic western liberals are all too happy to promote.<br>

If that is an &quot;official&quot; website of the Palestine government, then I have serious doubts about the facts posted on it.   The arab nations in that region are well known for the tight control they hold over their media.  Any mediaperson speaking out against the goverment are almost always fired, and face the threat of being jailed.   <br>
<br>
I did take a look at the articles on the sight, interesting how one (4/1/02) claims the isolation of Arafat is a war crime.  That is a new one to me.  They same article claimed that Arafat had no means of communication, funny I guess those telephone interviews I saw on CNN with Arafat was a figment of my imagination.  The other week President Bush made a speech with 3 basic issues... <br>
1) Isreal to withdrawl without delay  <br>
2) Arafat needs to condem and stop the suicide bombings (in arabic)<br>
3) Other nations need to butt out and stop inciting violence.<br>
<br>
At least those are some of the basic issues I remember hearing when I listened to his speach.  I guess the PNA editors heard it selectively.  Their news article only reports about issue number one, and doesn't mention or even hint to the other two.<br>
<br>
The website is a propaganda machine, some basis in facts but twisted and spun to distort the truth.  Read with a grain of salt.<br>

I agree with Zifnab, any theology that has clauses where harming others grants divine rewards is evil.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this...  If NBC cut Must-See-TV this Thursday to show Osama being executed live, not a single TV set in America would be off.  We wish the same grim fate on our proxy evils as everyone else in the world.  Palestinians feel mortally wronged and it is human nature to crave the blood of the ideal enemy.<br>

Thats a damn good point.  Palestinians &quot;retalliate&quot; for Israel attacks.  They should be consentrating on Israel's ability to make war on them.  It illustrates how Palestinians dont care for a &quot;war&quot;.  They kill the civilians of an ethnic group.  They want genocide.  (going off on a limb here but...)  History has shown us with the Nazis, Rwanda, and Yugoslavia that groups of people with genocidal wishes are worthy of obliteration at America's judging fist.

Petoffen, in response to your numbers game...  America is the richest nation in the world.  The citizens of first tier nations have an inheirently higher value than those of the second.  Our poorest, laziest, drudge of society generates more wealth in a year than they will in a lifetime.  When you translate the first tier's wealth into that of the world's, 1 person is easily worth 1,000.  I could take the money in my wallet and feed a second tier village.  Is it wrong to look at humanity this way? Probably, but that is the way it is.<br>

Muslims/Jews/christians have fought over the holy land for thousands of years and will fight over it for thousands more.<br>
We want the isreali's to win yet we can't afford to let them.<br>
America needs oil,so it's a tough call we help them we lose it or face higher prices that makes gas go up which makes people unhappy which gets politicians get voted out of office,so it's not about what's right or wrong it's about what everybody does to stay ahead.<br>
 As for the bombing,terrorism or not,tough call.<br>
On the one hand the are attacking civilians,which in a civilized society makes them terrorist,is it effective,hell yes it is,no one would give a rat's ass if Isreal killed a few hundred palenstinian's unless they did something to get it on TV.<br>
On the other hand the are attacking people who are relatively innocent to what's going on, and it isn't really a fair fight,such is war though.<br>
<br>
The thing that bothers me the most is the way the other arab countries are grabbing for glory,if the Palenstinians were sent to Iraq,Saddam would basically gas them or what not,if they were sent to Saudi arabia or Jordan and some were they would be put in refugee camps and treated no better than they are being treated by Isreal.Don't you wonder why they wouldn't just move?Because none of these other arab countries want them,their trapped they either get their land back and their own state or they die as prisoners,makes sense to me,you have no choises you take a few of the enemy out with you.I really doubt though that the rank and file Palenstinain really thinks the sucide bombings are a good idea,but the radical groups who push these people into doing it,they think it's an effective tool and will continue to do it as long as it's news worthy.<br>
<br>
I find it funny that most Americans find the Sucide bombers to be so strange and find it hard to beleive these people would do this,take for example your average or should I say akward High school student,put them in a situation where they are looked down upon,where they feel their life is hopeless and that they only way to get back at their oppressors is to take violent measures,sound familiar?<br>
<br>
It's not about religion it's not about Oil though it's about power,plain and simple.<br>
<br>

Oh well I'm rambling,look at this way in 1000 years people will look back and say wow the USA and The Holy Roman Empire should did resemble each other,I wonder if anyone ever noticed that? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubremmin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bremmin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 12:17:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16132.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An important point about Israel.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I could take the money in my wallet and feed a second tier village.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Why don't you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufalscorpse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fals corpse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 2:52:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16132.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An important point about Israel.</span><hr size=1> Zionist &quot;movement&quot; began in the 1850's.  There were always jews there...at least since Moses.  Palestinian describes a geographic area not a religious choice.  You can be a palastinian jew or muslim.  For most of modern history that area was controlled by the Ottomans.  Has more zionists moved into the area there were more and more conflicts that were largely ignored by the Ottomans.  <br>
<br>
Read this part carefully now....because if one more person says Israel was given to the jews because of WWII im going to scream:  The original Jewish State was created when Britain and France took over that area from the Ottomans at the end of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WWI</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The land that now encompasses Israel and West Bank and Gaza areas was seperated into Jewish and Muslim states.  Jewish states controlled first by Britian and then by France.  The muslim state was controlled by a coalition of other arab countries, Egypt/Jordan/Saudi/Lebanon.<br>
<br>
They coexisted not very friendly for the 30 years between wars.  At the end of WWII the Jewish people created their own goverment and asked for and recieved more defendable borders and financial assistance from the west.  This agreement pushed the Jewish States boundries beyond traditional historical religious boundries to make the country more defendable.  The arab coalition, none to please, attacked Israel.  Israel lost ground..all of the west bank...all of Gaza, but ultimately won.<br>
<br>
Now heres the sticky part.  The traditional Palestinian arab state including the West Bank was part of Jordan for those 30 years.  The funny thing is you never heard of Palestinian independence or the PLO while they were part of Jordan.  The PLO didnt exist until Israel took those lands back...plus all of the West Bank, all of Gaza, and the entire Sinai penisula in 1967.  Israel didnt start either of those wars btw.<br>
<br>
Anyway the sh!tty part is moderate Israelites and moderate Palestinian arabs would agree to a return to the &quot;traditional&quot; religious borders....only problem with that is that Palestine or whatever you would call it is split in two places and in some places Israel would be only 7 miles wide. Add to that the fact that both states want Jerusalem.  Hard way to split up a territory.  That was the original thought behind &quot;defendable&quot; borders for Israel.<br>
<br>
Israel shouldnt have developed settlements in the West Bank or Gaza and they shouldnt used such drastic measures on the Palestinian arabs....but how can you negotiate with people that dont want peace.  If Arafat would accept the fact the Israel should exist, maybe they could work towards an agreement, but has it stands all the Palestinian orginizations simply want Israel to cease to exist and thats not going to happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
edit: I urge you to not send money to any organization that claims itself to be a Palestinian aid effort.  Send money to a secular charity, the UN, the Red Cross.  Write them a letter explaining you want the money to be used to feed Palestinian children or whatever, but <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DONT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> send money to any charity that claims Palestinian causes.  Virtually every single if not every single domestic or international Palestinian aid organization has funded terrorist either directly or indirectly either by providing for families of suicide bombers or even purchasing bomb making items.  I feel for them too but no mater what your political stance on this, beautiful 18 year old girls shouldnt be blowing themselves up in supermarkets.  Make it stop. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ufalscorpse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fals corpse</A> at: 4/13/02 3:01:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#F5F5DC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/upetoffen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Petoffen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/13/02 5:34:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16132.topic&index=40>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/craig234/eq/petportrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An important point about Israel.</span><hr size=1> If anyone is looking for the greatest evil in the thread, here it is, from Ermok, where his values are quite poor:<br>

He is more bankrupt morally than the masses he discusses are bankrupt financially, it appears.<br>

It is a sick view to say that because they are poor, they are not as valuable as people - justifying discrimination.<br>
