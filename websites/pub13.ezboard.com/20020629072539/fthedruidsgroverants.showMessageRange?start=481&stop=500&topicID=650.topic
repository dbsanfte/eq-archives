Your requests are totally unreasonable, and i'm telling you now so that you don't get your hopes up before verant tells you no. You think verant doesn't know how all classes fit into the game? You think they don't follow uberguilds around and watch how they take out mobs for the first time? You're kidding yourself if you think they don't. Verant knows how druids fit in this game, they know how monks fit in, they know how warriors and paladins and clerics and everyone else fits in...and if there was a problem, it would be glaring. There is no glaring problem here. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Do you honestly think Verant would have balanced the melee so effectively without the collective input from the melee classes that was bantered about during the Monk petition? Before that petition went up we had a discussion for nearly a full month, dozens of posts every day, much like this thread. They need this kind of feedback. I already KNOW Verant by themselves doesn't know how everything fits in, because they simply have no way to measure a player's enjoyment of their class. That's not something you can learn by watching, it isn't something that comes out of a number generator. You can however get a very good feel for it on any of the class boards, and that's why they read them. These discussions have more effect on Verant's future changes than all in-game data combined.<br>

You can't possibly know as much as he does about Druids. What about 10 Elders telling you that you are wrong? Twenty? Fifty? Well heck, there's well over a HUNDRED elders signing the petition and giving it their complete endorsement. You honestly expect me to take your word over theirs? I don't think so. They know better than you. If that number doesn't make you go back and rethink your stance, you've got a problem with arrogance. I will dismiss your arguments, and believe that while you may know some things about the Druid class, you must not know enough to understand the problems that led to this petition. <p>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>

I'll repeat this since it was blatantly overlooked earlier...<br>
<br>
Not every Druid that hits 60 becomes a raid Druid. <br>
<br>
Every change you make to the level 60 raid Druid, that isn't done with Ancient type spells, WILL effect the normal xp part of the game.<br>
<br>
Why? Because, again, not every Druid that hits 60 becomes a raid Druid.<br>
<br>
If none of you are willing to acknowledge that whatever you do to fix your specific situtation, ie. raiding uber mobs for breakfast, will impact the rest of the general Druid and EQ population negatively by overpowering your class in day to day XP activities, then I don't know what else to say. <br>
<br>
I understand you're passionate about your class. But you really need to step back for a second and look at the big picture, the one that isn't focused on you and your specific needs. You are not the only one playing a Druid, for every 1 of you in an uber guild how many level 60's aren't even able to kill Kunark dragons regularly? How many of these level 60's who are, according to you guys, all in the high end game really just running around in Umbral, ME, Velks etc. getting AAXP?<br>
<br>
Your specific position in EQ is a unique one. What would balance you, the uber guild Druids, would not balance all of you. Think about that for a second.  <p>~ Azzikai, Luminary ~ <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66466">stuff</a><BR>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   VI designed the damage output of AEs and riposte damage on purpose. It is specifically designed to challenge the healing abilities of the secondary healers of a raid force. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's beyond challenging. Recently I participated in the toughest most demanding victory I've ever encountered.  We fought and killed the Arch Lich fairly late at night, without our full raid force on and ready.  I literally spent about 20 minutes of constant healing, curing (will be better once I get Greater Remove Curse), keeping RFS and Fixation on the mob so he wouldn't dispell Slow, and mod rodding.  More than once me and my entire group were all within a half bubble of dying before I was able to get an outside heal so I could mod and heal them.  Was I able to keep my group (a cleric, a chanter, a monk, a paladin, and I think a wizard) alive? Yes, with a little help from the cleric (and the paladin) when she wasn't busy keeping tanks alive.  <br>
<br>
Will I be able to now? Most likely not, since AL cant be slowed now, the clerics will not be able to help, and I'll be trying to heal an entire group of people being eaten by that DoT, Rampage, Mod Rods, etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The druid spell has a 3.2 dmg/mana ratio while the mage spell has a 3.0 dmg/mana ratio. The druid spell is going be easier to resist due to the stun component however. Against lower level and lower resist/debuffed mobs the druid spell is better. Against higher level/resist mobs, the mage spell is better. Feel free to correct me on this, I am neither a druid nor a mage. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The druid spell can only be used outside.  Most raids are inside.  There is a reason why druids rarely bother considering their magic based nukes, their use is limited and the high end game is primarily played indoors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I am aware that chloroblast and NT have the same ratio. I have 2 points to make. First, I was not referring to NT, I was referring to Nature's Recovery, which has a much superior ratio to Celestial Cleansing.

<br>
Nature's Recovery is not a heal.  It is a regen.  Every regen has a better ratio than direct healing or even HoTs (except, of course, Complete Heal).  The problem with regens are, they do not heal enough per tick to make a discernible difference on most raid level mobs.  NR's problems are further compounded by the fact that I can only cast it every 90 seconds.  NR is a spell that is really only useful if I'm duoing. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

This isn't OUR perception nearly so much as how other people perceive us.<br>

I would much rather be a secondary nuker/DoTer on a raid, but guess what? We're placed in groups to heal them.  We are priests, we heal.  That's what we are expected to do, that is what we need to do better.  <br>

Although my guild uses Guild Magic as our membership database, Guild Magic is NOT a good Indiactor at least on Drinal of the High Level RAID guilds that this petition is all about.  I went to Guild Magic for the purpose of finding numbers for level 60 characters in RAID guilds and found that Guild Magic is not used by RAID guilds on Drinal.  For the top 2 American Raid Guilds Cats In Hats and Crimson Twighlight only 30 characters are even listed on Guild Magic.  Each of these guilds have at least that amount on on any given night and usually double I would think.<br>
<br>
The best indication of the types of characters DESIRED for RAID guilds is to look at their websites, roosters and their recruiting policies.  <p><CENTER>

Your petition isn't about balance, it's about obvious overpowering.

Lets be completely honest here.  No matter what mob you fight, you are or atleast have the *choice* to use the epic.  You may not have the ability to use it's effect.

<br>
Read it again please. Read the last part, BUT IT HAS VALUE AS WELL. And here is the big thing you missed, you dont solo pretty easily at early levels ONLY, you solo pretty easily all the way to 60 (some would say very easy but lets use their words). So yes, your solo capabilities do have a effect in your balance. If you dont think how fast someone can get to 60 and how easy they can solo has ANY effect when you are balancing a class so will I repeat what I said earlier, then give all clerics all your snares, nukes, dots etc up to say 50. As it aint a issue how fast someone can level up so cant I see a reason why you would not want people to have as easy time soloing up to 60 after all. Or even better, lets all start at 60 so we can be balanced from start...<br>
<br>
Now, I replied during 5 pages here before, I aint going to start again because the same arguments are repeated over and over and I dont think either side will &quot;win&quot;. But I have to ask how #=&quot;¤/&quot;#=¤)/ hard it would have been to go check what other classes had. Someone looked at a paladin list and say, hey we want a better heal! Ignoring what clerics had. The next druid did some math on the dot and decided that was ok without checking what the current Necro and Shaman dots where. Why not actually look at what ALL the classes before you decided on the numbers? The once that actually dont flame you got the biggest issue with is after all the numbers and since you worked on this for months how hard would it been to take 30 min to check it up...<br>
<br>
As for all druids asking to heal 10% better (aka remove the cap) you should look into your AA abilities sometime. YOU ALREADY HAVE IT!<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My problem with this idea</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The problem is that you are asking for powers which rival those of the `specialist` class in each field.<br>
<br>
If your petition is successful then there will be very little reason to play a cleric in a non-raid situation because a druid will be able to do a cleric's job in an exp group.  But the druid will be able to provide sow, snare, DS, and invis as well.  So the cleric `specialist` class will lose the advantage that compensates them for their drawbacks.<br>
<br>
The same applies to necromancers, wizards, and all of the other classes on whose toes you would firmly be stomping in the event that your petition is successful.<br>
<br>
The uber players will all quit their 60 clerics, wizards, necromancers and whatever and power-level up druids because druids have the most advantages and the fewest drawbacks as a class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A Solution ?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
The state of the class can be summed up as follows:-<br>
<br>
&quot;Druids are relatively unwanted on raids and in high level exp groups because for every contribution they can make, there is a specialist class who can make a greater contribution in the same area.&quot;<br>
<br>
Therefore, I feel Druids need a unique area in which they are clearly the best or most useful.  I feel that this area cannot be one in which another class already occupies the `top of the tree` because of the negative impact on that other class.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that the answer is to give druids a new spell line which is unique to them and invaluable on a raid or within an exp group.  Ideally this spell line should be one which is in keeping with the `roleplaying` idea of the nature priest, but more importantly it should be both balanced and in reasonable proportion to the powers which are granted to another class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Idea: The Druidic Circle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Basically the idea is to give several druids (three or five) working <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> together</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> some relatively great powers.  This has the advantage that it increases the power of the druid class with respect to raids, without affecting xp groups - and it is unique because only druids could do this.<br>
<br>
The `circle` spells might have a 5 second cast time, a 24 second duration and 3 minute reuse time.  They have a very high mana cost and NO EFFECT individually.  However, if three of these spells are in effect on the same character or mob at the same time, then they are cancelled and replaced with the full Circle spell as follows:-<br>
<br>
Circle of Mistletoe - heals 2,000hp per tick for 5 ticks (which does not stack with the Celestial Healing line of spells).<br>
<br>
Circle of Holly - a 60hp damage shield<br>
<br>
Circle of Ivy - a 7,000hp low-resist poison-based DoT<br>
<br>
Circle of Oak - a +50ac +1,500 hp buff (which does not stack with Aegolism).<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can think of other examples.  The non-stacking issues are to try to retain a semblance of balance in end-game encounters.<br>

I was the main healer of a single group.  The main dispeller of a single group.  And I was the druid chosen to keep the debuffs up on the mob so they could be dispelled.<br>

And you purposefully missed my point.  The Arch Lich is a medium difficulty &quot;uber&quot; luclin mob.  I was barely able to do my job (and to be blunt, the major reason I had any chance to do my job is because I'm a damned good raiding druid, yea I'll toot my own horn there).  There are many tougher mobs out there where no matter how skilled I am..I won't be able to.  Hell they even nerfed AL and made him unslowable..next time I'm pretty much screwed I suspect. <p><p><center><img src=http://lilyanaeq.homestead.com/files/Signatures/Aidon.jpg>

Make them better support healers, yes - make them primary healers competitive with clerics?  No way.  I'm a cleric, and I'm being selfish here, I'll admit.  I don't want competition as primary healer.  I've spent 52 levels being TOTALLY group dependant.  I'm not interested in having to compete for a spot in a group with a druid, who solo'd his way up to 50 and now wants my spot in the group.  <br>
