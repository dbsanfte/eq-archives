(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Good lord, I feel bad for mages who cant even nuke as well you already.  No cold based for a mage at all, pretty much the same size and mana cost.  Mage=nuker.  As it is these changes would secure your place as basically a quasi cleric(yeah you dont get a pure complete heal gee itll be great to be a cleric so I can res and have a 5percent bonus to heals), 2nd best nuker in the game, porter, tracker, soloer, etc.<br>
      All I hear is sure we signed on to be good not great in a lot of areas, but we wont be satisfied until we are a key class too.  Personally I thought druids were a helluva powerful class as it was, probably too much so.<br>
      As it is you have the best hp/ac buff at 60, I have symbol to stack with it.  Thatd be marzins mark, with that combo you have more hps and mana regen.  Stack that with ac for the tank.  Aego just lasts longer its the same amount I could buff for since 54.  Less AC actually.  As it is we battle heal a caster pretty much the same.  Elixir isnt something I use for an enchanter getting stomped anymore than complete heal is.  As it is I can heal the main tank, I can symbol, and I can res.  Those are my only real high level skills, nobody else can do as well or close to as well as a cleric.<br>
      If this even went close to live I guess I could hang in the back with the mages making designs with mod rods and waiting to res or buff.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/utracors.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tracors</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 5:41:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us!

<br>
I do agree that the Druid class <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AND</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the Shaman class need to be given better secondary healing spells for the high end game.<br>
<br>
Stacking issues with PoTG and Aego I agree should be fixed to not over write each other.<br>
<br>
Caster's in general still are waiting for the &quot;class balancing&quot; we have been promised. This really does need to happen soon. <br>
<br>
*Note* To Druids regarding Torpor.<br>
<br>
Torpor is a GROUP only spell, meaning we can only cast it on group members. It also has a 30% attack speed reduction for 24 seconds and a Snare affect on the person with Torpor on. Yes, it does heal 1200 over 24 seconds for 200m but it definately has it's drawbacks. For raids it has no cross group healing ability so we are left with lower &quot;raid&quot; healing ability then the Druid class. <br>
<br>
I would like to see the Shaman recieve a &quot;general&quot; heal upgrade also along with the Druid Class. It's needed by both classed imo.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Well, I've read some great posts, skimmed some bad ones and ignored most of the trolls.<br>
<br>
The difficulty in balancing Druids with healing is this:<br>
<br>
Clerics do one thing.<br>
<br>
Clerics.heal.<br>
<br>
That's it, really. <br>
<br>
We have some buffs and resses, but those are secondary. I know I prefer POTG/Focus/Marzin/Bulwark to Aegolism/BAOTR, and you only need one cleric with a res stick on a raid. <br>
<br>
Any balancing of heal spells has to take into account that you have a class with 1 role (cleric) being compared against a class that can perform many roles (druid).<br>
<br>
As it is in the high end game, healing is uneeded in XP groups in many places. A warrior can go and xp all day and night in Chardok and get all the xp for himself. There is *no* healing change that is gonna make that warrior want a cleric or a druid to group with no matter what.<br>
<br>
Druids seem to want an upgrade to NT. All the complaints about NT are true as well for DL. It sucks. To give a druid an improved NT would require a large improvement in DL. <br>
<br>
If a magic wand could be waved, and Druids could now heal main tanks efficiently, where would the cleric class be? Nowhere. We only do one thing: heal people. If that role can be taken over by another class with great efficiency, there would be no reason for clerics in the game. <br>
<br>
I can't see why anyone would level a cleric to 60 if a druid could be leveled up far more easily and do almost a good a job.<br>
<br>
I hope all the stuff about the epic comes through. But I'll keep a close eye on any of these healing changes. It could invalidate an entire class quite easily, and after playing this cleric for 3 years, I'd hate to be made unnecessary with a single spdat.eff update. <p>Alliliel Archfalcon<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> Just some tidbits...<br>
<br>
5k warriors are easy...  my 59 monk in mediocre gear breaks 4.5k hp buffed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Need an evacer for howling stones. juggs, etc...&quot;  Bullpucky.  Live a little.  And any melee without a gate potion (shaman supplied!) or some other means of gating at this stage in the game needs to re-think that (gate hammer, thurga potion, etc.)<br>
<br>
#1 in snaring...  rather have the ranger snare since they can take the hits... and soo many classes can snare it's not an issue (yes even innoruk clerics can.)<br>
<br>
Extend the res timer...  had to laugh at that one hehe...<br>
<br>
Atk debuffs... perhaps you havent seen the tests and logs done by people here a while ago, but the general consensus was that there was little appreciable difference under most conditions.  I think this is probably attributable to what the shamans determined long ago, that some statistics simply do nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Buffs... Circle of Seasons is the only buff we offer the end game.  Dont believe me, well you'd be wrong.  Not exactly a game breaker if you dont have that 10 extra fr/cr that any other stat buffer cant give you anyway!<br>
<br>
Ports to the moon... dont care really.  Again people dont read tho... nobody asked for ports TO the moon.  Just ports on the moon.  Honestly the whole issue is a time sink anyway, verants idea of fun being to wait 15 minutes for spires/boats doing nothing.  Yet people want to buy into this useless waiting for rp reasons... well be my guest.  Or better yet, bind yourself in the bazaar like every other sensible melee and get a wizard port twink to send you back.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
Yes it is just barely possible for a druid to keep up on heals in some more intense places... but you're a wasted spot in the group if that's what you're doing there.  It's extremely inefficient.  If you are main healer in CT you should be embarrased and tell your group to get a cleric.  People keep saying, and this amuses me since it just sort of slides by, &quot;Well I can heal fine with my druid so long as it's slowed.&quot;   Hello!  Anyone can tank a mob if it's friggin slowed.  A ranger could heal that kind of damage.<br>
<br>
As for soloability, not gonna quote verant saying that no class should be punished for that again.  I never solo'd or quadded with my druid.  I'll turn the tables on you.  You tell me I wanna heal like a cleric to go start one?  Well if you wanna go solo like a druid, go start one.  Or better yet, start a real solo class like a wizard or a necro, or any class 60+.<br>
<br>
Other people complaining that we have the nerve to complain... that's amusing coming from wizards (grats snare, xlocs, free crits, planes travel, etc... you werent masters of travel originally you know.) rogues (grats well, everything, ya you needed work, now masters of melee damage and one of two REQUIRED classes to access game content), enchanters (started out badly broken, got fixed, got better, got great, now only better again) etc...  all classes have complained and changed.  So YOU get over it.  And dont ever complain or ask for anything for a class that you play if you cant.<br>
<br>
/shrug.  No I havent put my name on the petition cause I dont agree with some of it, but I dont come here and mock the people trying to save a class that needs work.  Class envy is always amusing when all you need to do is look who posted a complaint about druids here, then go visit their class board and see them whine and complain about their own class.<br>
<br>
It's a game people... yeah we all put a lot of time into it, but the point is to have fun, isnt it?  Does a druid getting slightly improved healing (hello for the blind I said SLIGHTLY IMPROVED NOT COMPLETE HEAL REPEAT NOT ASKING FOR COMPLETE HEAL) in the end game (for the blind END GAME THAT MEANS 60+ NOT XP GRINDING NOT 1-50 END GAME) reduce the amount of fun that YOU have?<br>

Ya know, that's just sad...  Not only is it sad, but it just shows why people don't want druids in their groups - they're very selfish...<br>

You need to spend a little more time in your spell book.  Plenty other spells in there.   If you would have said,  clerics heal,  buff and res better than anyone,  but dont have as much ulitity as a druid.  Well,  you would have had a point<br>

 I won't bother reading 54 pages of druid after druid agreeing to this upgrade, but I have to comment on what I did read.<br>
<br>
Obviously most or all druids will agree to this request. I did read the request and find some points valid and others totally outrageous.<br>
<br>
I have a 57 necro, 54 mage, 52 warrior, 49 bard, 41 shaman and some others of lower levels. I just want to clarify that because this request would impact several of my characters.<br>
<br>
Being a necromancer as my main I must STRONGLY disagree with the request for a dot of that calibur. I mean where do you guys get off requesting this? It is TOO FRIGGIN close to necros best dot in the game and we are the masters. Shamans are a close second, but that request is complete stupidity. Give us a break! Druids offer too much utility to the game to EVER need a dot like that!!! They can solo all the way to 60 no problem and offer buffs, heals, sow, teleport. They may not be the most wanted class in a high lvl group, but they are much more desireable than necros and not bad off compared to the rest of the classes. I'll just never get over this request.<br>
<br>
The main point here is that you feel less able to fill the role you once had before all these expansions came out. I won't agrue with that. I'd also like to say that most other caster classes feel the same way. I honestly couldnt stand to play my mage anymore after Kunark came out so I quit playing him.<br>
<br>
I believe that if complete heal had never been brought into the game the world of norrath would have been a much better place. CH is just too powerful. Because of that one spell alone VI has had to beef the mobs up to insane hps and stats. And guess what, everyone else but the holy trinity have to suffer because of it. Without that spell mobs wouldnt need so many hps. All classes could be toned down a little and brought in line to be more on par with each other.<br>
<br>
That leads to the topic of healing. I have a shaman, but hes not very high yet. I know my heals are pathetic comapred to CH that clerics have at my level. I do think clerics should obviously be the masters of healing, but I agree that some other heal after sup healing should be put in the game. I dont think any other class should EVER get CH. It would devistate the game even more than it has been already. Imagine druids and shamans running around with CH plus all the other cool things they can do. I think some heal upgrade is in line, but not CH. I know you didn't request CH, but I just wanted to clarify that. I also hope you agree that shamans need an upgrade to heal if druids get one since they both get the same heal at the same levels except at maybe lvl 60.<br>
<br>
All in all I think druids are an easy class to play and offer a lot of utility. I think druid's nukes should be toned down. Its stupid that a druid can nuke more than a mage. Mages are purely offensive. They offer no defensive abilities for themselves or others which should mean they are next to wizards in damage. IF the mage could safely use their pet in all situations it would definately help with that problem.<br>
<br>
I cannot agree or disagree with the other requests because I don't have a druid and they dont directly affect my other characters that I can see. Don't flame me because I don't have a druid. I dont claim to know all of the druid's problems, but I can sure see when a request like this may affect another class that I am familiar with.<br>
<br>
The request was nicely written and it looks like there is a lot of support.<br>
<br>
Maybe I need to make a formal request to give necros dot stacking, better pets, better dots ect ect. I doubt there would be as much support though because of how underplayed the necro is at high levels. Hmmmmm I wonder why that is... How about a 4000 hp dot in 40 seconds. Yes, that sounds about right to me.<br>

Unless you have played a druid 50+ then you are basing your observation on stupidity.  These ideas are to make a druid a more viable GROUP addition and to help more on high end game raids.<br>
<br>
VI is totally against soloing and wants to get people to group.  It defeats the purpose if a druid is not needed, and not even looked for to be added to a group.  A lot of classes can solo, and some of them can solo far more efficient than a druid.<br>
<br>
I am so glad that the one dude who posted looks for a druid in two zones in the game..for ports.  Of course, druid isn't needed there, if for example player is good enough to get a gate potion which are available(thurg gate) or a wizard is there who can also Translocate/port.  Or he looks at them for &quot;snare&quot; which can also be done by rangers, sk, necro, and even wizards.<br>
<br>
I can solo just fine.  It is boring.  Druids are taken for groups by most as a last ditch resort or he is with friends.  People don't take druids because they are bitter they can solo, they don't take druids because anything a druid can do, someone else can do better, in everything.  Oh except for CR/FR which on raids is one thing we get to do, but while exping CR/FR is not really needed at all.<br>
<br>
A druid is not the only one who is a &quot;jack of all trades&quot;.  Many abilities and spells are criss crossed across everyone.  A shaman can slow, a chanter can slow, but shaman slow is superior.  A shaman can sow, a druid and ranger can sow.  Many buffs a shaman can give, a chanter can give, but a shaman buffs are better.  A chanter though can crowd control and dish out mana regen spells.  I can go on and on with similiar spells that classes can cast and how one stands out above another, but you should get the idea if you are a good player.  What can a druid do that nobody else can do in the game, or a druid can do better?  Nothing.  Wizards are the masters of travel, not druids, or do I need to remind you of Translocate spells?<br>
<br>
To continue, All priests can buff...but while Shaman and Cleric HP buffs stack, Cleric and Druid HP buffs do not.  FoS, level 60 HP buff, adds 405 HP, same as PoTG would add..so how is it unbalanced or stupid if PoTG can stack with Aego?  Just make it so a person can have on or the other, FoS or PoTG, like I said before, a melee would probably prefer FOS, while a caster PoTG.  This does NOT give anyone any more HP than is currently available.<br>
<br>
No one is trying to say druids suck, just trying to balance the playing field.  I don't really think druids need more healing power, it is similar to being on par with a shaman, however a lot of you underestimate the ability of torpor.  It can be used on raids for a very mana efficient heal.  Saying that Torpor and Malo are 100Kpp?? LOL holy jesus.  I guess my friend got the deal of the century then when he got each for 10-15Kpp.  Malo for 10K and Torpor I believe for 15K(may have even been less like 12K).<br>
<br>
As far as DoTs go, I think druids need a new DoT, just like I believe Shamans need a new nuke, but no way do I think druids should get a DoT which is equal to Shamans or Necros.  A DoT with a damage to mana ratio around 4.2-4.5 would be a nice addition, and still under the ratio of Shamans/Necros.<br>
<br>
In regards to the fact we can nuke, yep, we can.  I am not looking to improve our nuking abilities.  Our nukes are balanced I believe in that Wizards can nuke far more efficiently and faster than we can, and they have lure nukes, we do not.  I have had Wildfire fully resisted against a freaking Goo in CoM that was Disjunctioned and Breath of Ro'd.  For the foolio who said Winged Death was a lure DoT, you are totally wrong.  It is not 100% unresistable.  It can be resisted by mobs, and even in PvP it can rarely be resisted.<br>
<br>
People are giving ideas to help EVERYONE in the high end game and exp grouping.  Other classes need revision as well, this is a druid website, so it is talk about druids, with suggestions by people who actually PLAY druids.  Yes, it used to be druids were very welcome additions on raids and groups, but times change.<br>
<br>
If you want a good comparrison:<br>
<br>
Travel:  Wizards have the edge with the inclusion of TL spells.  Druids can SoW, but all players in the High End game can get close to perma Jboot speed with Inate Run 3...which of course works indoors.<br>
<br>
DD spells:  Wizards are hands down the best there.  More efficient and Lures.  Druids do have some powerful DDs, 59 and 60, do high damage, HOWEVER, they the druid 59 DD and the Mage 59 Line of Sight DD have the exact same efficiency for damage per mana point of 3.2, and the 60 druid cold based nuke is actually LESS efficient with a 2.4 damage per mana.  The 57 mage magic based nuke has a ratio of 3.0 damage per mana, and likewise the 60 mage nuke has a ratio of 3.0.  Basically, Mages and Druids are TIED for second as far as nuking power goes, both of them with a damage to mana ratio around 3.0.  For wizards their ratio is mid 3s to 4s.  Personally I think their ratio should be a little bit better.<br>
<br>
Buffs:  Clerics are obviously the best especially in the high end game, however Shamans are a very close second, and most importantly, their buffs STACK with Aego.  Druid buffs are good, but hardly anyone wants PoTG.  Not to mention, Clerics can buff AC, and Shamans have several stat buffs, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyway, a lot of things have to be looked at and improved, It would be impossible for me to compare everything, but there are some changes and some minor adjustments that can be made to help out everyone in the high end game and more viable for EXP groups.<br>

<br>
Bogus question. Very few classes get asked for specifically to fill out a group. Usually people shout for any class able to fill a specific <b>role</b>. These are generally:<br>
<br>
1. Tank <br>
2. Healer <br>
3. Snarer <br>
4. Damage dealer <br>
5. Evaccer<br>
6. Crowd control<br>
7. Mana regen<br>
8. FD puller<br>
<br>
Druids can fill more of those roles than any other single class except bards, and bards are marginal for most of the ones that apply to them.<br>
<br>
I don't understand why druids feel they can't be successfull secondary healers on raids. Druids are the best raid healers other than clerics. No other class gets a single target instant heal spell that heals that much. The other secondary healers have to rely on heal over time spells that do not stack and cannot be chain cast. This means that druids can heal more by chain casting than the other secondary healers, and that druid healing stacks better. If you are talking about raiding druids that are below level 60, they have the exact same healing spell as shamans do at those levels. Druids heal just fine on raids.<br>
<br>
If you are going to complain about xp group healing...don't. <br>
<br>
Before level 60, druids have the exact same heal as shamans do, while paladins have either greater or superior healing. At level 59, paladins will have a heal over time spell with greater mana efficiency than chloroblast, but that advantage dissappears one level later. <br>
<br>
If you want to compare healing at 60, stop before you get nerfed. Shaman's have torpor as their best heal at 60. It is a very nice healing spell with some large drawbacks. It is group only, it snares the recipient by 30%, it also has a slow component. The slow component will negate any spell haste while it is in effect. Druids recieve the largest single target heal with nature's touch. They also recieve a spell similar to torpor without any of the side effects, the only downside being the longer duration. Please don't tell me you are actually asking to have the duration made the same as torpor without any of the side effects of torpor. Unlike any of the other secondary healers, Druids have the option of slower, more mana efficient heals <i>and</i> the option of large instant healing spells. Druids are second best to clerics at healing.<br>
<br>
Druid nuking power is just fine. Do you really want Verant to compare your nuking power with mages? At level 60, a druid has a <i>better</i> selection of nukes than a mage does. Druids and mages have a comparable magic based DD, druids have a better fire based DD than mages do, and druids have a good cold based DD, which mages do not have. Druids can nuke better than mages can on a wider selection of targets. Druids are second best to wizards at nuking.<br>
<br>
Druid dots are just fine. I wouldn't compare druid dot power against shaman's dot power. Shamans can stack 2 dots, druids can stack 4. Shaman dots are more damaging than druid dots are, but the dmg/mana ratios are very similar. Druids can stack more dots, for more damage, for a similar mana cost per point of damage. Druids are second best to necros at using dots.<br>
<br>
Druids have the best fire and cold resist buffs of any class. They have the second best damage shields. They have the second best ac/hp buffs - many a time have I been on a raid with a druid as group healer and gotten PoG because our clerics don't have the mana to keep aego on everyone.<br>
<br>
Druids have a stackable fire resist debuffer that no other class has, which is also a usefull AC and atk debuffer. <br>
<br>
To sum up, druids are the second best healers in the game, the second best nukers in the game, and the second best dot users in the game. They also have usefull debuffs and buffs, usefull ports and evacs, and other nice utility spells. And you want more?<br>
<br>
I do see a need for a single target version of PoG. That is blindingly obvious, but better healing? No. Better nukes? No.<br>
Better debuffs/buffs? A slight maybe.<br>
<br>
I would caution you not to draw the eye of Verant's balancing team, I do not think you would like the results.<br>

<br>
For one... dont compare your class when you are pointing out deficiantcies.  its doesnt prove anything except your standing. The one good arguement you have is that a druid cannot keep a party alive, even when doing exp. If you can prove this in most cases, then you have a valid arguement, but if you sit in a group and ONLY heal, and find that you can keep them alive, then you dont.<br>
<br>
what is your class?  this is the question you need to ask.  the petition takes the position that you want to be #2 healers. Thats fine, start with respecializing all you druids in alteration. Then continue with only keeping regen and HP buffs on your party and not using snare/dots etc.  why?  cause as a healer you dont have the mana to waste. If anyone is thinking that you should be able to snare/dot/heal/buff/etc *and* still have mana left, your misunderstanding the penalty of being a healer.<br>
<br>
a cleric in a raid has two jobs.  Buff --- heal.  To this is we specialize alter, get items that are free healing, eat mod rods like M&amp;M's and in the end, hope we clicked on enough diffrent people to keep them all alive. There is often not enough clerics to do the job right.   in most cases you need one per group and really a spare dedicated to the main tank as well. <br>
<br>
An ideal situation would have 2 clerics in the MT group and a cleric and secondary in all other groups.  My definition of Secondary isnt the guy that doing slow every combat round, of the guy landing snare.  its the person sitting next to me staring at a wall medding watching six little bars and chat.  Its the most boring job in the world, and i value your willingness to join me there. <br>
<br>
So unless your starting at this role, please dont ask to be able to do anything else... make yourself a healer first, then see how much you truely lack.<br>

(State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> The sad fact with this petition is that it is very lacking in facts. Someone later filled in some facts for the DoT suggestion, but even there missed to include some of the more important factors. This is very bad as Verant isnt as stupid as some may think and will think of these things. Not including everything only makes your case look worse. Its also somewhat strange to list getting spells earlier as a disadvantage (winged death compared to shaman dots).<br>
<br>
Ok, now to do a more complete comparison between the dots mentioned earlier. The most important stats of dots are: Damage per second, Damage Per Mana, Duration (should be low), resistability (should be low). Total damage is less interesting, similar as to Moonfire at 1100 isnt 63% better then Ice Strike at 675.<br>
<br>
Winged Death 23.8dps, 3.68dpm, 54 seconds, very low resist.<br>
Breath of Ro 15.3dps, 3.68dpm, 60seconds, very high resist.<br>
Pox of Bertoxx 19.3dps, 4.86dpm, 108 seconds, very high resist.<br>
Bane of nife 39.2dps. 3.88dpm, 42 seconds, very high resist.<br>
Spell proposed in petition 40dps, ???dpm, 50seconds, very low resist.<br>
<br>
The diffrence is resists is large enuff that the mana efficiency of Winged Death is more or less the same of Pox against xp mobs and far better for raids. Pox actualy doesnt have any real advantage, wich is interesting as Pox was the reason given that winged death needed an upgrade. Bane of nife does have a significant advantage in speed, but has closer to Breath of Ro in mana efficiency. In the end Shamans have the advantage of speed and druids in low resists. Making Shamans somewhat better against low mobs and Druids against higher mobs (is this news?). Add the proposed dot and Druids would be better in all ways on dots then Shamans.<br>
<br>
The single target POTG is probobly the one suggestion everyone has agreed on so far.<br>
<br>
I found a good suggestion while reading the replies thou. The idea of a partial complete heal for druids and shamans. Partial heal, 10 seconds cast time, 33% hp healed for 800 mana (my suggested numbers differs a little from the original suggestion). This would basicly make 2 druids and/or shamans able to fill the shoes of 1 cleric. So it wouldnt make clerics less wanted, just let druids and shamans heal some more in the end game. Its also an example of a reasonable suggestion that actualy might be implemented without totaly changing class balance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/unicolheartsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nicol Heartsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 6:30:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.hiwaay.net/~kostrom/erudite.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Conversation: What about Us! (State of The Druid)</span><hr size=1> There are a few good points in the petition, which oddly enough are all on testing or are live already.  For the most part, I find this petition rediculous in its specifics.  For crying out loud, just take the numbers out so people can &quot;agree in principle&quot; and so the petition doesn't look so stupid.<br>
<br>
Mind you, I am already disappointed in how many druids ditch their essential roles in raids, making it pretty hard to make groups I'm sure, so they can bring their low level ineffective melee twinks in an attempt to feel like they're contributing.  Those who aren't happy as a druid simply aren't fit to have so many abilities.  I, personally, happen to know that I would rather be focused on a specialty, so I'm not a druid.<br>
<br>
But enough of that.  The good points:<br>
<br>
I agree about single target glades.  Did you ever think that people don't ask for glades because some of us are too considerate to ask for a 1200 mana buff on demand?  That's the BEST buff in the game, imho, after C3.  Seasons is up there except for some stacking issues.  The fix is in test.  <br>
<br>
No evac options on Luclin without getting stranded far away?  This was a problem in kunark, too.  Ever XP in nurga?  The fix is live, and exceeds my wilded dreams.<br>
<br>
I could agree with a slight upgrade to the 60 heal, <br>
&lt;delete&gt;but I also feel that druid offensive capabilities should be nerfed&lt;/delete&gt; even though you guys already rival a lot of offensive caster classes.<br>
<br>
The druid is a great group and solo class with great offensive capabilities and plenty of healing to get the job done, and a vast array of raid essential buffs and snare.  The velious breastplate (grossly unbalanced - I like it) helps ensure druids are able to handle their 55+ raid healing duties.  <br>

Wow Druids Stepped on a lot of Toes.<br>
<br>
Necro Complain: An updated Druid dot would be too close to  a Necro Dot.<br>
<br>
By that Logic, Nerf the Necro.  Why?  Because thier too damn good at HEALING.  Have you ever had a NECRO as main healer.<br>
I've had one do a better job than I could at druid.  <br>
<br>
Cleric/Shaman Complain: Wah its too close.  Natures Recovery is too damn close to a clerics best heal.  Even without the penalty.<br>
<br>
Natures Recovery is NO MORE MANA EFFICIENT than CHLOROBLAST.<br>
<br>
A shaman can direct heal as efficiently as a druid.  using the same damn spell. <br>
<br>
And can do MORE of it.  Because they have more mana supply by canning thier own life.<br>
<br>
They can also downtime heal, and/or group heal far more effienctly with Torpor.<br>
<br>
Quadding is a Joke.  Shaman, Necro, Monk, BST, can all out XP a quadder.   AE groups, the ultimate xp, use clerics/enchanters/wizards not druid.<br>

Crit heals... Makes up for alot of our problems healing in the high end game.<br>
<br>
Teleporting - EVEN wizards cannot teleport to the moon. Why should WE? And not to mention that we get lesser succor now, so no, you don't have to wait til 57 to be viable on the moon. <br>
<br>
Epic -  I Agree... Do something with it... although i believe we should have either a focus or a FT effect on our epic as well. <br>

Keep in mind that if you want to be secondary you cannot be better than the Primary DOTers or whatever you want to call them. Necros cant: heal, GG, HP Buff, Speed Buff, and much more, and Druids can (we can heal, but not without losing Substancial Health to get a melee type in good shape from less than one bubble of health). You may or may not get Dire Charm as one of those skills at lvl 60, but if you do your pet could be just as good or better then a necros, so necros would find it much harder to get into a group at high end lvls if the Druids get those better-than-necros DoTs. Just my 2cp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ullegolas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llegolas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(4/8/02 6:38:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgroverants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=650.topic&index=139>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How often do you look for a druid to fill the last spot in your pick up group? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is the real problem with EverQuest - people thinking like this.  One should not LOOK for any particular class.  It's a flaw in the game that Clerics and Enchanters are necessary for 80% of all grouping situations in this game.<br>
<br>
What you guys should be worried about is NOT being wanted for a group.  If a group of five doesn't have a healer-type, and still refuses to pick you up, then I suppose you have a reason to bitch.  Until then, I don't see a problem with your healing.  <br>
<br>
Take it from a Ranger, who knows what it's like to not be wanted.  I virtually always lead groups, and I never turn down a druid for a group, unless we've already got one, or unless we already have both a shaman and a cleric.  Otherwise they've got enough all-around utility that we're good to go no matter what spot they're filling, be it healer or otherwise.<br>
