<br>
It seems like every paladin has to make a choice:<br>
a) Stay 52 to fight Vox/Naggy for what could potentially be several months while your friends level past you<br>
b) Level up and take your chances with finding the forces to take down Kunark dragons<br>
<br>
It seems like some people would like:<br>
c) All of the above<br>

<br>
so.. you lvl to 53.. you suddenly have a huge HUGE gap till you can actyally make a difference on a kunark dragon raid, so while all these lucky bastards who managed to get their epic at lvl 52 are runing around im still fighting with my arbitors combined..<br>
<br>
yeah, i didmake the discsion to stay at 52 and infact lose 53 many times months have gone by and my friends formed into an uber guild only excepting lvl 58-60 and yanno what i miss them something cronic does this mean i have to give up any hope on something uniquiely paladin (and yes im another one of those who got every single piece of ro by quest my soulfire my goulbane anything like that)<br>
<br>
i would dealy love to have a full set of valo, hell i have kit that craps all over valo but yanno what i would wear it with pride same with deepwater.<br>
<br>
i COULD run vox naggy raids on my paladin. yep.. sit there organize groups handle all the tells get people picked up have CR planned have clickstick clerics ready do the whole thing EXCEPT for the dragon.. but yanno what.. i never had the stomach to send 20 30 40 people to their deaths while i just watched.. i just couldnt do it so i decided to EARN my place on vox/naggy raids and i worked very hard to get my cleric up (btw 51 sucks even second time around) <br>
<br>
dunno why this upsets me so much.. prehaps it is the fact that these people who where lucky enough to win their books with out ever haveing to run a raid all whine and cry when a lvl 53+ paladin comes along and has made a damn good effort to work hard towards killing these dragons wins a book..<br>
<br>
to all you peps that won your books on your alts while actually fighting for it.. grats guys im proud <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  to you peps who credited yourselves with the book while runing a dragon raid.. thats still cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and im glad ya managed tio let 20,30,40 people have a good time killing a dragon and getting other loots... to the rest of you that whine because a lvl 53+ pally is getting books NOT off a kunark dragon.. tough doodoo<br>
<br>
<br>
btw the idea about ONLY haveing the books drop off kunark dragons.. i think i kinda like that .. it would make it a whole lot more epic and almost totally unobtainable and CERTAINLY unobtainable before what 55? but.. it would make it a fair challange<br>

<br>
Cry me a river. Explain to me how this is different than the 52 pally that has spent 6 months not leveling? That pally could be 57-60, but they chose to try for their epic. If the epic was as valuable to you as it is to the pally that stays 52 for months on end then maybe you would delevel with multiple deaths to get a shot at it. If your levels are so useful and valuable to you then kill Kunark dragons. If you can't get the group together to kill one then what are you losing by deleveling except some spells/hp and some use of skill points? (and you still keep your skills capped at the level of 54)<br>
<br>
The time that pally that choses to stay 52 is no different than the time someone that was 52+ would lose (potentially, of course someone can get good or bad luck) by deleveling. As to the idea of only putting the books on Kunark dragons, oh, now THERE'S a winner idea (/sarcasm). Talk about being bitter and wanting to take it out on every other paladin out there.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with someone organizing a raid and setting aside epic loot, but the idea of someone rolling for another character is unfair to me. The only way I see it as fair is if:<br>
<br>
1) it is known before the loot is known so that someone doesn't hear the loot and then see there is nothing for their alt they are playing and try to roll on a book that dropped, and<br>
<br>
2) every other paladin on the raid agrees<br>
<br>
I really don't give one rat's ass if your alt cleric helped more than a paladin would, that doesn't give that character the right to roll on epic class specific loot. What if some cleric that doesn't have a paladin as an alt wants to roll? Maybe that cleric thinks that a frost book can be sold for much much more than a tobrin's eyepatch, and so they want to roll on it. They helped just as much as anyone else and more than any paladin, so shouldn't they get to choose what they want to roll on? Of course not. Putting aside all issues of determining who really has an alt of whatever class (considering this is really a pick up raid issue or multiguild raid as on a guild raid none of this would matter) compared to those that are lying or have a friend log on their X class character that is 53+ and claim to be that person on another computer, it is simply not very kosher to roll on epic quest rare drops as another class.<br>
<br>
People that see no problem with this (this particular situation, as I said, guild raids are different) want to have their cake (FD) and eat it too (level past 52). If you want to level or keep your level and want your FD go kill some Kunark Dragons. If you can't get the people together to kill them then you aren't losing too much by deleveling anyway.<br>

&gt;&gt; I unfortunatly DID spend 6 months at lvl 52 dieing multiple times to keep 52. Prehaps, you do not know what it feels like to see all your friends who you have grouped with since lvl 20 at lvl 60 and you are still 52 and thus unable to group with them in the high end game? prehaps when your 3 closest ingame friends take you on low lvl raids out of sympathy or.. when you go with them and unintentionally agro mobs due to your lvl and wipe them all out just because they wanted you to be with them. Prehaps you should try that.<br>
<br>
That was your *choice*, no one put a gun to your head and made you stay 52 to try for your epic. While I am sympathetic to anyone who loses grouping with their friends, that doesn't mitigate the fact that it was a choice on your part to do so and that does not give you special rights to looting that would never be considered in most other raid situations in pickup groups. Either stay 52, try for your epic, and bite the bullet with regards to your friends leveling past you, or bypass your epic (or live with the hope of the luck on a Kunark dragon) and level up and group with your friends.<br>
 <br>
&gt;&gt;What lvl are you sir?<br>
<br>
I am 52. Once I hit 51 I stopped going for experience at all, and all my experience is incidental to being in the KS group on a raid, helping someone get an item etc. I;ve been 51-52 for over 3 months, and since I got to 51 in 3 months, that will tell you that I easily could be 55+ by now if I wanted, but I *chose* to try for my epic. And yes I have had some friends go on, some join the resident uberguild, etc. And yes, it does suck to see the people I grouped with all the time in my 30s and 40s as high as 59 and doing things that I can't do, but again, that was my *choice* to do so just for a big flaming sword.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Why is this bitter? this quest is after all supose to be &quot;Epic&quot;<br>
<br>
FA was a pre-Kunark quest. Just because the FD part of the quest can be done relatively easily, does not mean squat. The only reason you or anyone else would want the epic items moved to Kunark dragons only would be to 1) force more people to be interested in killing Kunark Dragons, 2) take your bitterness out on paladins lower than 52 just because you are upset that you tried so long and hard for your epic and are jealous of people that got lucky. I am sorry, but moving the epic loot to the Kunark dragons only is petty, unfair, and just plain stupid. And &quot;epic&quot; is relative. I remember in my first eq go around 2 years ago thinking of how &quot;epic&quot; the Soulfire seemed and how amazing the the planes armor was (not val, the stuff before val was put in) or how awesome rubicite was. Now that is a distant memory. verant has stated before that epics aren;t the &quot;be all end all&quot; weapon for a class, and as the next expansion comes out FD will fall even further behind the highest end weapons. It is a high level quest, with a great reward, but just because people call it &quot;epic&quot; doesn't mean that only people 55+ should have a shot at it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;sorry i dont have the stomach to watch 20-60 people throw themselves at a mob and die while i watch not takeing any danger to myself whatso ever.<br>
<br>
Oh god, what danger? That some sprites on the screen might die? That someone might lose a fraction of a blue or exp after being rezzed? These people go there mainly for the chance at good items, some go for the experience, but most don't. If you want to RP and be all &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;chivalrous&quot; etc. fine, don't organize a raid, but if you don't have the &quot;stomach&quot; for that why do you ahve the &quot;stomach&quot; for some alt of yours to fight and your main to get the rewards? Apparently it is ok for your main to send in his or her littler brother to do all the dirty work and reap the rewards, but not for you to send in an army? <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;rules should ALWAYS be stated before the raid commences if you do not like the rules then leave it is quite simple.<br>
<br>
Of course, but that wasn't the point of this discussion was it? The point was a discussion over the &quot;ethics&quot; of it in the EQ world. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;your second statement contradicts the first. Loot rules are stated by the raid leader and nobody else. if the paladins that have come on the raid do not agree to this then tough.. the rules are spoken before hand and like EVERYBODY else they have legs.. <br>
<br>
Like I said, this wasn't the issue we are talking about now is it? A leader could make a rule that they get all the loot and no one rolls for anything, and it is still possible to get a group of people together that just want to participate or get dragon practice, but that doesn't make it &quot;fair&quot; does it? And that is what we are talking about, what is &quot;fair&quot; versus &quot;unfair&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;personally i have found paladins to be more usefull on dragon raids then most clerics, paladins heal much m,uch faster and i always make sure that the cleric does not heal me if i need a heal i wait till im low enough and loh or stop attacking lose agro back off and heal myself that why i dont trouble the cleric with worrying about one of their tanks.. or i dont overrite any of their heals.<br>
<br>
Um, well, then you are in the minority then. Anyway, I don't remember ever being healed at a dragon raid anyway, the things die too quickly for anyone to need or get a heal most of the time. So maybe that 500 damage or more you might do before the dragon falls is useful, but is in no way more useful than a cleric adding 600+ hp and some AC to up to 10 people, allowing them to survive several more partially resisted AE blasts.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;that doesn't give that character the right to roll on epic class specific loot.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;i never said it did<br>
<br>
But that is what you are supporting explicitly.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;dragon loot is sold on your server? interesting.<br>
<br>
Of course it is. I play on The Rathe, a very very old server that only had its first ever server split a couple of months ago. Everyday in EC RBBs, CoFs, tons of low level dragon loot like Hiero crooks, etc., even Kunark class armor BP and Legs might be found for sale. Often dragon books, scales, etc. are also sold.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;i never said for one second that i had not got this agreed with specific raid leaders well before the actuall event. unless it is made blatently clear before the event took place i would never roll on a book. i have been on numerous dragon raids for nothing less than a pat on the back from the cleric who was too high lvl to help clear naggy so they could get to rage.<br>
<br>
Again you are skirting the main topic, what is &quot;ethical&quot; versus unethical, not what you have gotten a raid leader to agree to and thus forced every single other paladin on the raid to either agree to or not participate. That is why I said earlier to get the other paladins to agree. You are essentially &quot;cheating&quot; by working around the 52 level cap on the dragons and taking away that opportunity from a &lt;=52 paladin that may have stayed 52 while you leveled on and are fighting in ToV. By getting together with a raid leader and forcing this on the other participants you are not being &quot;ethical&quot; in my opinion. And we have all done stuff without getting rewards, so big deal. Its called being &quot;nice&quot; to try and help someone out.<br>
<br>
As I said, I feel it is different if you are organizing a raid for the purpose of getting a book. In that case you are the reason there is a raid at all, but when you are just another participant and get something like that cleared with the raid leader you are fucking over the other paladins. <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;have you ever killed a kunark dragon sir?<br>
<br>
Other than the spawned Fay, no. So what? What's your point? That it is easier said than done? of course it is. But by not staying 52 or delevling you are getting the worse chances of getting your epic with the advantage of being able to level and do much more challenging things. <br>

however, Sir, I see you are intent on your opinion and that just as i have made my discsions and justified my cause and choices you have equally made your discsions and justified yours.<br>
<br>
I agree to differ.<br>
<br>
and since we will never be on a dragon raid together, thankfully this is a moot point.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope one day you get to experience the end game IMHO it is a completly different game to the pre 52 game, that fact became obvious to me once I lvl'd my second toon to the 51/52 mark.<br>
<br>
Be' seeing you.<br>

If you move the books to Kurnak Dragons, you are punishing those Paladins who do not have access to uber guilds, huge network of friends and such.  Yes, it's ALOT easier getting the books off the Kurnak Dragons for those who are in Uber guilds, but you are punishing those Paladins who choose to stay 52nd.  <br>
<br>
Good grief, just because you are 57th, that does not mean you should dismiss the rights of other Paladins!  You are one of the MANY who are caught by the changes on the Old World Dragons.  Moving the Epic drops off the Old World Dragons will not solve *your* problem.  It will only serve to place the Epic out of reach of the majority of Paladin players.  Not everyone will join guilds that will enable them to tackle those mobs.  <br>
<br>
I am sure you are a good guy in game, but atm you sounds awfully vindicative and bitter about the Epic situation.  <br>
<br>
I can understand why many Paladins choose to forsake their Epic and go ahead and lvl.  The 55+ game is very different and far more exciting than the pre-52nd game.  My opinion on Alternates rolling for their main at raids is as follow. It is up to the raid leader to make that call.  Provided that Alt isn't going to roll on anything else NO MATTER what else drops.  <br>
<br>
What's wrong with a lvl 52 Paladin weilding the Epic? He/She deserved it by staying at that lvl and worked hard for it.  If you don't like the dmg on your ACGS, let me offer you a few suggestions.  Try to get some of the DN weapons, they do nice dmg and range from 30/40 to 32/36.  Or if you are a Paladin of Tunare, you should get the ND.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Best wishes to all Paladins trying for their Epic.  Just remember, this is a game.  Do what's fun.<br>

<br>
I don't understand something here. How is getting a drop from Vox for someone thats level 52 different than getting a drop from some other New World dragon for someone thats higher?<br>
<br>
Its not like a 52 Paladin can solo Vox. It still takes a large number of people (certainly not uber, but a good mid-level guild can do it).<br>
<br>
Are you saying that players above 52 don't have pickup raids? <p>Macchan Draagonheart<BR>

I don't think a pickup raid would have the skills, resists, and organization to take down gore. <p><b>Eiago X'ul Octavious</b> <br>Fear Puller Extrodinare.... <B>Cazic Thule shouts: EIAGO!</b>

There are many great players around, but it only takes 1~2 idiots to ruin a raid.  Pickup raids might be able to kill Sev or Talendor... but Gore is a biotch to kill without the proper fireworks.<br>
<br>
Just the other day, a lvl 52 Paladin sought my advice on getting books for the Epic.  He has been 52 since Jan. My advice to him was to lvl to 55+ asap and start to tag along on bigger guilds' raids.  In most of the bigger guilds, Paladins are getting their books.  I was 52 back in Jan.  He choose to stay 52nd while I choose to level and enjoy the game.  Now I am 59th and I am enjoying the game very much, and I am doing things he simply can't do at 52nd due to his lvl(build in resists) etc.  <br>
<br>
I really can't say whois right and whois wrong, but I do know I am having alot more fun.<br>

I am always willing to agree to disagree. &quot;Ethics&quot; is all a matter of opinion anyway, so agreeing to disagree is quite fine with me.<br>
