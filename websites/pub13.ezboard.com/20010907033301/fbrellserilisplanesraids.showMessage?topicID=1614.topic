<br>
Rants served next to no purpose. guy ninjas a FBSS. another cons a person of a SMR. now a CoF of all things is ninjaed! come on. people who follow these people are meant to be burned. how many warnings did people need about barkona? i am still in shock he got the help he needed to do his epic. <br>
<br>
In light of this we need to do something as a community besides TALK. we need to take action. the first part we need to do is clean up the rotations. this will deal with the number of untested people in a loot situation:<br>
<br>
Old world Dragons: Get rid of the indys. they need to go. Tranq of Nirvana needs to be punished. they need to lose all spots they currently have. its not like we're denying a guild that matters to the populace as a whole or can just go take something on its own. IMO its time the dragons went FCFS. yes my guild is on the rotation. yes ive pulled off multiple dragon raids. yes my guild can send 1/2 the people we need to the raid to be sucessful. ive had enough of the exploiting of the rotation.<br>
<br>
Trak: no indys. this doesnt seem to be an issue yet.<br>
<br>
Fear/Hate: heres gonna be a sticking point. we need some qualifiers to host these zones. im gettin fed up of getting multiple tells a week asking to come help some failed raid. fear is constantly being canceleed or im being asked to help portal break to do CR. this is insane. and when i go look at the boards its always some nitwit ive never heard of that cant get into the raids because they are friendless or plain suck or have a horrible rep.<br>
<br>
Hate... Exile did a 4 hour CR? thats insane. i had friends on that raid who asked me to come help. to put together a portal break to get them rezzed. 2 hours later they finally got LA to go up and bail them out.<br>
<br>
so its not just indies who are incompetent. people will forever sign up for every raid. hell i dont even look at the posts on this board that people do after i tell them the correct place to post. <br>
<br>
i guess im just frustrated. everyone thinks its their right to raid these things. and admittedly i used to be one of them. but it has to change. too many wasted days as they say. whats more wasted? the zone going unused or the zone going unused with 30-40 corpses sitting at the zone or SS? <br>
<br>
well ive rambled here, but something must be done on this all. too many people cheat, lie, steal or are plain incompetent. if youre barkona you are all of these.<br>

Hehe.. be glad you don't have to hear him whine in guildchat about all this.  As I play my enchanter more and more and I've always known this and tried to be selective, I tend to stay away from raids, but there's the times when good friends I don't want to see hurt or loose a corpse call me into things I know are going to be bad. <p><IMG SRC="http://129.82.121.243/morkjl/eq/cazicmaal.jpg"><br>

<br>
Even if one does not succeed on the combine, one does sometimes gain in skill level. A lesson from Trade Skills can be applied to this situation.<br>
<br>
Also, not every raid <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  can </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be successfull. If they were they would be alot less of a challenge and not as fun. Sure, successful raids can be a challenge and more fun, but the possibility of failure is what makes success so rewarding.<br>

It is not jsut new guilds or Indys that have problems with CR's.<br>
<br>
Idiots happen... Barkona has had multiple threads in general saying he has problems too, not just in rants.  Granted in rants they were much more vocal.  There are two rant boards people can now use to help let people know about this stuff.  <br>
<br>
And as for a sense of community?  I agree we have lost some of that recently.  I don't know if it is an influx of new people or the new power the easy Kunark leveling has offered though.  You no longer have to respect others to rise to the top of the server in level anymore.  Some classes can solo to 60 and what does that teach them about respecting others and fair loot rules?  <br>
<br>
But to make more situations where you have to be more powerful to win will only make idiots gather together IMO.  Make naggy FCFS and people will flock to those that can kill him and have proved it (Barkona for example).  I am sure some people out there believe he won't to what he did to a friend or a guildmate, that he will take care of his own.  So then people will flock to him and hope he gets them some good loot too.  There are plenty of other people that have done things that people don't like that now have the ability (read level and a few friends) that can take out some nice mobs and get good stuff.  Now people will group with them just because they can kill the mobs.  And to make matters worse the server becomes FCFS on certain mobs people can just walk in gather friends (and people that want the drops off of the mob and no loot rules posted ahead of time in FCFS) and kill it.  So they then get the rep of being able to kill that mob and more will go there with them to do it...  At least with a reservation system in place it give people a choice of who they want to kill dragons with and to know the loot rules up front.<br>
<br>
But my opinion matters very little truly... I like the way it has been and to see it crumble like this saddens me...<br>

If barkona is hosting a raid I could sit right in the middle of his raid and wait till he have found all the people he need. Then I could shout that if anyone on his raid want fair loot rules they can just kill the mob with me instead.<br>
<br>
Do you really think anyone would stick by him then?<br>
<br>
Only people that would stick by him would be his friends. In my time in EQ you can make all the crazy loot rules you want, but if you want the raid to actually happen you better be rdy to compromise. Unless you can provide between 80 or 90% of the raid. First thing everyone ask you when you invite them to a raid is loot rules.<br>
<br>
If there are 2 people in a zone trying to create a raid at the same time. One is claiming stuff and the other is not, who do you think people will go with?<br>
<br>
Right now its only the rotation lists that created the scenario you describe. Cause the lists goes out almost a year ahead, only chance people have of going is to go with whoever got the spawn next on the list. That is what is allowing someone like Barkona to pull the @#%$ he does.<br>

Take his people then loot it yourself.  At least with posting rules ahead of time there is a chance that you will hold to your word and uphold what you posted.<br>
<br>
I posted my loot rules for my Vox raid and I made a mistake (luckily not one that caused any problems but I was tired and rushed).  And I told every caster recruited online and not on the boards what my loot rules were as they signed up.  I have a very high sense of honor and I hold to that every cahnce I have.  But the unscrupulous need not do that and say oh well.  But if they post ahead of time that they are going to do something, then hopefully they will hold too that.<br>
<br>
Honor and respect are the things I value from myself more than any other aspecta.  That holds in game and in real life.  I think that if we all start using these values more in the game that will solve most of the problems.  Changing to FFA, FCFS or keeping the boards will not change the fact that people are acting unfairly on our server.<br>
<br>
But then again I could be missing your point and gne of the deep end here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree 100% on the liers, and so on. But what can be done. You sit there <br>
and camp a 6 hour spawn and not even 5 min before it spawns you have to <br>
answer the door or something and someone rushes in and takes your kill, So <br>
you call a GM and what do they do NOTHING, and if you speak out about you <br>
are the one punished for saying or asking why that person can get away with it.<br>
<br>
    As for raids i dont do many i do go on hate and fears raids when i can.  I also<br>
was asked to come help on the 4 hour CR run in at Hate, Trust me it wasnt pretty<br>
at all.  Its getting to the point myself and my real hubby Eolis dont even want to <br>
do raids anymore, i mean you sit in there killing for 8 to 10 hours and what do you <br>
get out of it NOTHING.  One question i have, Why give wizards the port to hate <br>
