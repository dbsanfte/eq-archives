<br>
To answer yance's request -- yes, there are a congregation of fairies over by the Tower where a rare (i think) Brownie can spawn (the rangers need something off it). Just off some of the fairies there (NOT the jongelours).  That should start the cycle pretty easily. <br>
<br>
On the topic at hand, I haven't really looked into EricFate's Theory, but I do believe in what he's saying. Spawn &quot;areas&quot; exist, and the trick is finding them. <br>
<br>
--Currently, as this Mage FA hullabaloo is occurring, I'd think more Quillmanes are spawning, or at least they are recorded as spawning. Expect a change soon on the drops... I'm focusing my &quot;camps&quot; in the southern Paw, western Aviak area, and I'll post what comes up. <br>
<br>
**I did run across a Synge (that halfling druid) spawn that I offed and got a nice Bark shield from. Immediately after, Grizzleknot spawned, and was killed, but I was not able to find out where he did spawn (the killer was so kind). :P I do know that it was not near the Synge I killed (SW area-- between Paw, Aviaks and Shadowmen). <br>
<br>
Good luck all on your Quillmanes!<br>

I did levels 21 - 25 here grouped, levels 29 - 36 here solo, and from time to time go back for quest items even now at level 49.<br>
<br>
I recently went back to finish collecting items for my monk's Red Headband quest. While killing Shaman Lenrel and Shaman Ren'Rex to make the rare gnolls I needed spawn (a hunch which turned out to have worked BTW), I got bored and began to kill anything on track. You should have seen the shouts for rares in the zone! &quot;Coloth Meadowgreen at aviak village.&quot; &quot;WTF 2 Sentry Alechins (sp?)!?!&quot; &quot;Groi Gutblade at Paw if anyone wants him&quot; I also personally killed Narra Tanith, Synger Foxfyre, Quillmane (leggings doh), Knari Morhawk and Grizzleknot, which the rest of the zone did not get to see hehe. I am almost convinced that almost anything wandering around in SK could be a placeholder for a rare, the rares are just, well, rare.<br>
<br>
Give it some thought : how many times a day is a_lioness_01 on the outskirts of the major camps (Paw and Aviaks) killed every day? Is she EVER killed most of the time if she doesn't aggro anyone? How often are those wandering treants killed? What level 20 player who is in SK for experience actually hunts down mist wolves or shadow wolves, and why are these MOBs even in a lv 20+ zone? I started thinking about those things and thinking about the rares in the zone while waiting for my gnolls. As soon as I started killing everything all the other players in the zone weren't interested in, rares started to spawn all over the place.<br>
<br>
Here are a few things I know about the rares here in SK :<br>
<br>
- Killed Quillmane (pegasus) NW of Paw, where she hovered over a big hill. Nobody in the zone even knew she was there, and there were a lot of people at Paw. If they did know, they never said anything in shout/OOC. I had gated back to the area Ren'Rex spawns in to wait for him and there she was headed NW from Paw. Previously I had been killing a few things over in this area, and I suspect I just happened to get her PH.<br>
<br>
- Killed Grizzleknot (treant) once by Paw and twice by the Aviak Village. He seems to spawn north of the aviak village and then walks south, and eventually walks right under the village and makes his way to Paw. There is another regular treant who is his placeholder, and who does the same thing. To get rid of this PH you have 3 options as a druid : <br>
<br>
1. You can charm the treant and send him against an avocet so he gets killed. Only works if he is a lower level treant affected by beguile plants. No faction hit here.<br>
<br>
2. Always try to charm first. If the treant is too high in level to be charmed you can either kill it outright (would not recommend this action) or start scouting for treant killers and see if you can train the treant to them and then port out. No faction hit here.<br>
<br>
3. You can blast the treant to extremely low health (may have to use lower level spells here instead of massive nukes), let him heal, repeat until he is drained of mana, DOT with your best, and then teleport out. He will die while you gate back and no faction hit.<br>
<br>
Note : An idea I had but never executed was charming an elephant or bull elephant, taking the treant to very low health and sending in my pet and DOT and then teleporting out. I have seen where MoBs will continue to fight each other, even if the &quot;pet's&quot; owner has zoned out, until one of them dies. Only problems would be if the treant heals himself or the elephant simply won't attack a treant due to their level being lower. Just an idea.<br>
<br>
- Narra Tannith and Synger Foxfire (wandering unkempt druids) were both killed in the Shaman Ren'Rex spawn area, which I would say is due west of Splitpaw, over a hill. They had spawned somewhere in the direction of Paw, as I have always seen them here from an east-west route. I have also heard a few times of Narra being sighted at the Aviak village, so any MoBs that go from the village toward Paw may be PHs. Again, I have never seen these NPCs unless I had killed the roaming creatures in the area that no one else really bothers with.<br>
<br>
- Groi Gutblade (troll shadowknight) was killed north/northwest of Paw, but did make a detour to Paw first from somewhere else. That's how I knew where he was - someone shouted that he was at Paw before he began to head NNW. All 3 times I've killed him he was sighted at Paw first, so any MoBs wandering around just North of Paw could be his PH, with the exception of maybe wandering aviaks.<br>
<br>
- Knari Morhawk (aviak) was killed in the area north of Aviak village two times and just east of Paw once. His PHs are definitely the roaming Aviaks, which can range from egrets to avocets, if I remember correctly.<br>
<br>
- Coloth Meadowgreen (centaur) was killed by Aviak village 5 times, and I'm pretty certain his PHs are the wandering centars in that area, as I was killing those.<br>
<br>
- Sentry Alechin (sp?) and the wandering monk of the Whistling Fist were never killed by me so I can't say what may spawn if they are killed or what faction hits there are or aren't. I can say that they seem to roam around the aviak village and then move to Paw and then back, but I never really paid attention to them much. Also, once they spawned I stopped seeing Grizzleknots and named druids the rest of my time there, so take that how you wish =(<br>
<br>
- The Undead Cyclops for the paladin quest spawns north of the aviak village, as does a regular cyclops and maybe one or two regular placeholders. He then makes his way toward the Lake Rathe zone line area and then to Paw.<br>
<br>
For anyone interested in the Red Headband quest :<br>
<br>
- High Shaman Grisok (gnoll) spawns north of the aviak village. His placeholder is always Shaman Lenrel. Either shaman could spawn on a set timer, although their spawn points vary to an extreme. I counted at least 9 different spots where I initially picked Lenrel up at different intervals.<br>
<br>
- High Shaman Phido (gnoll) spawns due west of Paw, over a hill. His placeholder is always Shaman Ren'Rex. Either shaman could spawn on a set timer, although their spawn points vary to an extreme. I counted at least 6 different spots where I initially picked Ren'Rex up at different intervals.<br>
<br>
I may have the names Grisok and Phido reversed, as I'm going from memory, but everything else is fact. Also I would add that these two are extremely rare spawns, and I actually had to kill 30 - 40 Lenrels before a Grisok spawned (maybe just bad luck, but it explains why I was there in SK so long goofing off). In addition, I don't think I could have done this quest if I didn't have tracking skills, as these guys spawn and then take off in all sorts of directions at high speed.<br>
<br>
Well that's it. The sum of my experiences in SK. I would like to add that I'm now a lv 49 druid with Elder Spiritist's Vambraces and Gauntlets, which makes killing green MoBs in SK really easy, when combined with root or a high-damage weapon. Therefore, this tactic of killing all the trash MoBs may not work for lower level druids trying to get one of these rares to pop. I also recently got a Luminescent Staff so I could pretty much kill the entire zone of wandering MoBs now, but I haven't tried it yet, too busy having fun with it for exp. If I do go back sometime, I'll try to get spawn points and locations of sightings. Hope I helped some of you =)<br>

She is a beautiful white pegasus.  Very majestic.  (Much like the pained unicorn for the druid epic quest in LFay if you've ever seen him, but with wings.) <br>
<br>
The last time that I saw her I was soloing my wizard (who was 34 at the time) at the middle spire at Paw.  She conned blue to me, so I figured why the heck not? I'm kicking butt on these gnolls, and they con blue so why not give it a shot.<br>
<br>
So I targeted her, casted Bonds of Force (wizard's version of snare, but it's AE) it stuck, I had SoW at the time.  Nuked her for 360.  I ran, she some how still caught up to me.  Proceeded to bonk me a few times on the head for 70+ a pop.  I ran again, nuked her for 360 a couple of more times.  Had her down to a quarter health.  She bonked me on the head again a few more times.  By now I was down to a bubble health and figured I had better zone into Paw and quit while I was still alive.  Enroute to Paw, some warrior came by saw Quillmane, and killed her while I zoned into Paw with 46 HP left. I came back out, the warrior was standing there with a crowd over Quillmane's corpse, and everyone was rolling for something.  Apparently she only dropped feathered leggings.  I got chewed out by the warrior that killed her cause I was rolling even though he saw that I had did most of the damage to Quillmane.  Oh well such as life.  Quillmane was beautiful nonetheless and can hit pretty hard. <p><CENTER>

<br>
There is a non-ordinary (not rare, not super-common) MOB that wanders all over the zone that I've noticed, when killed, a higher percentage or rares actually spawn.<br>
<br>
The times I've tried it (killing only one or two of these MOBs), I've run into Grizzleknot, Narra Tanith, Synger Foxfire, Quillmane, the Ogre necro (but never Mroon).<br>
<br>
I promise I'll post if I feel I have the correct recipe for kicking in the spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umenyena.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Menyena</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/3/01 12:25:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quillmane, you know it, now kill it!</span><hr size=1> Bump.

Was camping the Hermit, and someone shouted that Quillmane was up.<br>
I poked my head out of the Hermits walled in area, and there it was, flying right past me.<br>
No one was around either.<br>
I was playing my level 22 Wizard at the time, and I said to my guild that I was following Quillmane around.<br>
I was too low of a level to try for the kill myself.<br>
A guildmate decided to TP to NK and then ran into SK to help me.<br>
He got there, and I had been following Quillmane back and forth for awhile.<br>
It amazed me that no one else had shown up yet to take the kill from me.<br>
Quillmane followed a course that went diagonal from the Hermit hut to the Lake Rathe zone line back and forth about 3 times before my lvl 51 Druid friend showed up and killed Quill for me.<br>
I did not even think about what it might have for loot, when my friend said that the cloak was on it.<br>
He let me loot it, and now my Wizzy no longer needs batwings!!!<br>
I did not even buy the levitate spell when I got my next ones.<br>
Thanks goes out to Jarom Oakenhart of The Sign of One on the Karana server!!<br>
Thanks bud! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#e6ebd7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uflaim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flaim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(2/26/01 6:07:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quillmane, you know it, now kill it!</span><hr size=1> Nil,<br>

Grats and welcome to the club;)<br>
<br>
Be warned, the cloak will change your perspective on looting now.  You will be in groups when they start squabbling about 'loot rules' and such and you will just sit back content, and say 'I'll pass'.  Sitting on that cushion of air, which is worth at least 25+K* to me for sure, will do that to you.  <br>
<br>
*And yes, I know you can't trade it, but if it *were* droppable and someone offered me 25K straight up for it, I would pass. <p><font face=Arial size=1><b> <a href="mailto:fyyrlupinestorm@hotmail.com"><font color="#990000">Fyyr
