<br>
I am a 40th level female wood elf druid.<br>
<br>
I had a peaceful happy life playing my ogre warrior(big ol' lovable oaf,according to my guild ;) ) and human mage (which no longer exists),only with my ogre getting the occaisional addle-brained requests for clarity or any number of shaman/druid spells be cast on them..<br>
(Even though my ogre's in full crafted wielding a great big sword.)<br>
/duck<br>
 Anagrog emits a cool breeze on Target. =)<br>
<br>
Ever since I started playing my druid, I have gotten some of the scaryest things to happen to me in this game.<br>
<br>
*Sitting in the bank,a dark elf wizard (naked) approaches me and says nothing for five minutes. I just ignore him thinking he went AFK. Nope. He said...no, not &quot;Hello&quot;. but THIS instead:<br>
&quot;what do u hav 4 me? i poor wizzy.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Butcherblock. Camping the dwarves near the docks going about my merry way. Then, someone /shout's something very polite and gentle over the zone:<br>
&quot;Looking for port to nk for 2pp. And 2pp is all I can pay if you want more thats your problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Overthere at Skyfire temple. I just got killed two times by the dang Goons,(why do they have these stupid things wandering there? Just to get on player's nerves..sorry,this has taken me off topic) was sitting there before I even have touched my bodies. Someone,notably, a male dark elf enchanter,stopped, /whistled, then said &quot;can i have port to wc plz? :o) ) (oh yah,the smiley makes it all better,doesn't it?)<br>
<br>
What is WRONG with these folks?<br>
<br>
/rantmode<br>
<br>
Idiot 1:How do people get the nerve to just walk up and ask someone if they have something waiting in the bank for you?<br>
Ohh yes,my little socially challenged inkie friend, I have rotting friggin' PILES of uber wizard gear in the bank here,just waiting for YOU to wear it. All high level druids have mountains of INT caster gear in the bank and on their inventories with nothing else to do with it but to hand it to YOU.<br>
<br>
Idiot 2: Fortunately, no one ported this brat,in fact,every one in the zone was making fun of them. ;)<br>
<br>
Idiot 3: Never EVER EVER /whistle at a female druid that just died, is steaming mad, then ask her for a port in a flirt. She's likely to shove one of her fingers down your throat and cast Fire Strike. Don't say I did'nt warn you.<br>
<br>
/rantmode off<br>
<br>

When I still played EQ I got the same exact request from an ogre warrior. <br>
<br>
I was playing my druid and medding at the stone bridge in NK while waiting for a friend and he apparently saw me from the wiz spires and asked me for a rez.<br>
<br>
When I told him that, &quot;I'm a druid I cannot rez.&quot; He simply replied with, &quot;So?&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't even bother with trying to explain it to him again.  He can just reread my first response and think REAL hard. ;)  I also have to wonder, being that my druid was a wood elf, when was the last time you saw a wood elf cast rez? ;)<br>
<br>
The vice versa happened to my high elf cleric.  While medding along the shore one day in LOIO, a troll comes running by and asks for a SoW.  I told him, &quot;sorry can't sow, I'm a cleric.&quot;  He said, &quot;why can't I get a sow?&quot; LOL  I didn't even know how to answer that one.  I just said, &quot;when was the last time you saw a high elf cast SoW?&quot; <p><CENTER>

This reminds me of a event that happened the other day..<br>
<br>
Group needed a chanter.. grab chanter.. Noticed his gear was a bit lacking.. but didn't think anything of it.. So we're forming at the Zone in to Seb, and He mentions lots of people (including his guild) Don't like him, and he doesn't know why..<br>
Thinking.. ok.. he's lvl 53..<br>
<br>
So the group doesn't get a start.. celric leaves, low on tanks, and he asks for a port out.<br>
<br>
I inform him I'm staying, and that he could gate/run to No Hope/EJ etc.. He's like You can just gate back here.  I'm like no, I'm bound elsewhere.  He *tells* me to bind here, at the zone in to Seb.  I say I can't bind here, He informs me I can bind *anywhere*.  At this point I tell him, not only can I not bind here, but I am not making the run back to Seb from EJ.  He tells me to run to the zone out so I can port him =/<br>
<br>
At this point, I waved good bye and Ported to DL.. leaving him in Seb..<br>
<br>
I told the guild about it, a few where there watching him look stupid, and one of our chanters says she's plauged by questions on chanter spells by this guy, who should know the answers if he's 53.  <br>
<br>
So.. the Moral is...<br>

Sure there are some parts of Norrath that you cannot bind in (Tim Deep) but the last I checked, you can bind by Seb.  At least at the orb.  I was never stupid enough to bind inside Seb. :)  Not that I'm saying that you should bind just to port him out. <p><CENTER>

I was at Velks last night. We were doing quite well hunting in the pits. had a 54 + group except for me, 52 Dr00d, with Cleric, Chanter, Shammy, Rogue, and Warrior. We pulled two named Kibolds and did fine (although the second one Complete Healed itself twice during the fight, but we still got it (sucker!! :P)). Well, after a few more normal pulls the warrior heads out to pull some more and suddenly we see his health drop to 1 bub. WTF? a named had jumped him, but that amount of damage is way outta league (he was lvl 58). He brings in named and Cleric starts casting Complete Heal and me Sup heal (slightly faster). Not in time. War goes down. So Rogue starts to tank. Not good. He goes down, then I try to root it (no-one had called evac, although in retrospect I should have made that decision) but after first resist mob is on me. hitting way up there in the 200s. I go down in like 3 seconds.<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
I'm bound in OT (been PLing a few guildies of mine) and I'm greeted by the General...<br>
WHACK WHACK WHACK!<br>
hit 6 times for over 150. no buffs on me, no sow, no nu'tin... I walk straight ahead, no zone, I turn, walk back, zone...<br>
End up in FM (duh!) but.... on LOIO side... :P<br>
with 20 hp...<br>
I gate to WC (just to be safe) and sit to wait for the CR being organised by the cleric who had gated (He eventually gets a 60 epic wielding Ranger, and 2 58 level tanks to help him get to our corpses). While I'm waiting I see the typical shouts and /ooc requests:<br>
Need port to 'soandso' for 'whatever_reason'...<br>
Followed shortly after by a /tell to my nakkid self sitting at rings. 'Can I get a port?'<br>
'Sorry, waiting for a rez.'<br>
'Hehe, you must be some jerk-off Dr00d if you got killed...'<br>
<br>
WTF???? I'm like What mental institution lets their patients play EQ???<br>
I actually had to laugh at that. It caught me so by surprise I almost missed the little pop up window which was telling me I was being rezzed :P.<br>
<br>
Norrath is full of such fun people :)<br>

It'd be a pain in the butt to run back to the Orb from EJ (or attempt the Seb zone out) to bind just to port his arse out.  Although since you're a druid (correct?) binding at orb while hunting in Seb isn't half bad an idea anyways. :)<br>
<br>
Anyways, next time just tell the guy to cast an illusion spell on you and see if it changes you into a wizzy so you can Translocate him.  <br>
<br>
Say something along the lines of, &quot;yeah I heard Verant made Illusions spells to where you can cast it on someone and it changes them into different classes!&quot;<br>
<br>
Idiot_01, &quot;I don't have those spells. (((((&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What? You mean you never got those spells?  Well you should get them ASAP!  You'll never have to worry about TPs again!&quot;<br>
<br>
If he asks you where, just think of some place, doesn't matter where. :)<br>
<br>
See how long it takes him to figure it out.  It always makes a good laugh to stump an idiot. =P<br>
<br>
God I'm cruel. =P <p><CENTER>

<br>
I find, at this point in time, a Bind at Karnor usefull becuase I have alot of guild people I don't mind porting from DL, and it saves me and them the time of running to the castle/Rings.<br>

I often bind in Dungeons - Old World.<br>
<br>
Examples are: SH in Lguk, Alcy in Perma, etc, but I only do this when I *know* I'm not fighting for exp, as a death into a room full of mobs just isn't cool ;)<br>

Too much can go wrong when you gate or die and respawn in a dungeon.  Whenever I played my druid or wizard, I rarely moved my bind spot because I can usually TP to the zone or within one zone of where I want to be.  (Short of Seb, which I've always bound my bindable chars at the orb.)<br>
<br>
When I played my cleric I often don't have a choice but to move my bind spot and bind everywhere I hunt, but I NEVER ever bind inside a dungeon.  I bind just outside at the zone border, but NEVER inside. (An exception would be LGuk or a Vox/Naggy raid, but I rarely went to Guk anyways.)  The only time I broke that rule was during a guild-ran Efreeti raid when I bound my wizard in the Efreeti room so I can easily gate back whenever someone needed a port out.  (Of course this was before the implementation of Translocates.)  Otherwise, I don't even bind in Fear except as my cleric, for obvious reasons. :)<br>
<br>
Had a friend once who forgot to rebind himself after a Vox raid and gated into the buff hall.  Good thing he was able to pull a TP off before he got squished. =P I can die easily enough and just fine without doing something foolish. =P  But that's just me. :) <p><CENTER>

Well, maybe growth, but I'm not Kos there, and I never plan on hunting there.<br>
<br>
In Gernal tho, I also bind outside, I would only bind inside if I knew the area was free of roamers, etc. and I would be safe.<br>
