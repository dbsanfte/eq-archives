why? because the &quot;church&quot; is made up of mortal man. I dont trust mortal man.<br>
<br>
Priests that molest alter boys, church organizations that show prejudice in either race, color, marital status or how much money youve donated to the church...dictations of what THEY believe is the way to live your life.<br>
Just a cult, pure brainwashing period. (some call this faith)<br>
<br>
I was taught that god hears your prayers behind a closed door in your room...also to do unto others as you would have done to you. dont lie, cheat, or steal. help the helpless. dont kill anyone.<br>

V Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek! <br>
<br>
IS promoting violance as a solution to problems.&quot; - maddie<br>
<br>
The act of vengeance is not violent. Its how you carry out that act of vengeance that may be violent.<br>
<br>
And from the catholic religion to satanist religion. Its a way of life. Not this whole spiritual hiearchy of gods and saints or witches and demons or whatever. And if there is im sure as hell some guy taking care of sheep didnt know about it any better than we do now. Just belive in the teachings of the religion to live a better life.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uacturus01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturus01</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eternusastralis.com/site/logo/ea60x60.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/27/02 11:30:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/umaultriss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maultriss</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(4/27/02 12:26:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fprexus95980rants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1080.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Respect?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was treated like I meant nothing<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

From the sounds of things lately, you got off lucky to be treated like nothing rather than being treated like something &quot;really special&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
This is why I am pretty much agnostic.  I can't be certain that there is no God anymore than someone who is certain there is a God.  For me to say &quot;There is no God and you can't prove otherwise&quot; would be rather silly because I can't prove otherwise either.  I would *love* to believe there is a God!  I would *love* to believe there is a heaven and I will someday get to see the people dear to me whom I've lost over the years.  I would *love* to put on the blinders, I've tried many times to.  I can't.  Logic and a free thinking mind step in and I can't.  I wasn't raised in a church where religion was beat into my head on a daily basis.  I'm really just not sure, but I know that if I were to become a faithful person and bring myself to believe in God, I'd still be screwed anyway because there is no way I'd ever buy into an organized religion.  I would be a God lonewolf and according to the Christians, that ain't enough. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I live a good life and if that isn't enough when the time comes, oh well.<br>

As far as religious whackos go, we have religious whackos on TV everyday.  Well known religious whackos.  Remember Falwell &amp; Robertson saying Tinky Winky from the Teletubbies is gay because he was purple and carried a bag.  Then they went on to say that September 11th was our fault because we are too tolerant to gays.  Robertson hosts the 700 Club, a *very* popular show with hundereds of thousands of viewers I'm sure.  They make outrageous statements (on TV, no less) and then make retractions denying it.  Are people really that stupid?  I guess so.  These are religious whackos with HUGE followings.  Not as obscure as some may think.  Like fanatics in Islam, many of these followers also believe it is okay to kill as long as it is furthering the agenda of your beliefs. <br>
<br>
I'm sure it seems I am picking on Christianity, I'm really not.  Christianity is just the most widespread religion and most outspoken.  It was funny, I was watching Politically Incorrect one night and Bill had a Christian minister, Jewish rabbi, Muslim ??  (I'm sorry, can't remember the name for the spiritual leader), and an author who wrote a book about religion.  Everyone on this panel were very respectful towards the other leaders and towards their beliefs except the Christian minister.  He wouldn't let anyone else speak, told the rabbi that he was going to hell, would get almost irate if another leader made a good point.  The rabbi mentioned a well known Jewish rabbi (can't remember name) who took care of the poor his entire life.  He said &quot;I'm certain God would not send this man to hell simply because he didn't believe Jesus died for his sins&quot; and the minister said something to the effect of &quot;He sure will&quot;.  Do any of you REALLY believe that God would send someone who devoted their entire lives to helping those less unfortunate to hell simply because their beliefs were a little off?  If that is truly the way it goes, I would rather burn in hell.  I don't want any part of that, because it would be horribly wrong.  If *I* know right from wrong better than our almighty God, then I guess I belong in hell.<br>

Gee, and why you think you bombed afghanistan ? :)<br>
<br>
If that one thing is the only you found that proves that satanism is a violent religion, I fear there are plenty of other examples just as good in the bible<br>
<br>
To me, those things in satanism as a whole, represent a viewpoint that says &quot;I don't give a fck about you if I don't know you, I give those respect that give me respect, I treat those kindly that treat me kindly, and I don't take @#%$ from anyone&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course, I am sure there is much more to satanism than just that thou :)  <p>Aebriol Ildstorm 50 Runemaster Jaded Souls Palomides

Wrong.<br>
<br>
The God of Moses (Musa in arabic) and the God of Muhammed are the same. Simple proof of this is the fact that Kosher meat is considered Halal (not forbidden to eat) for muslims. <br>
<br>
The Muslim God is also the same as God the Father for Christians. Jesus being the son of God is however rejected, he is considered a prophet and regarded very highly however. <br>
