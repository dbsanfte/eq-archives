Check Sony's official description of a Paladin:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
A paladin is the very embodiment of a holy knight, *FIGHTING FOR THE CAUSE OF GOOD* in every aspect of his or her life. As the paladin gains life experience and proves his devotion, he will be granted the ability to use limited clerical magics. They share some of the powers of clerics along with a good deal of the fighting ability of warriors, but have a few virtues all their own. Only those who are pure in heart can become paladins, and the so-called &quot;evil&quot; races have yet to produce them. Dwarves, Erudites, half elves, high elves and humans are the only races that count them among their numbers. <br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
(Emphasis mine)<br>
<br>
This is why there are no Paladins of Innoruuk or Cazic-Thule, and why there SHOULDN'T be any Paladins of Brell or Bristlebane. (Okay, I'll let Brell pass...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Generally, this just leads to debates about the definition of &quot;good.&quot;<br>
<br>
There's still a lot of leeway though, such as whether or not you must heal everyone who needs it, how bloodthirsty you are when it comes to evil beings, and the like. Some Paladins may view other PCs as distractions to his quest to slay evil, and totally ignore a human being killed by a bear. They can be condescending and even rude, and still fit the description well enough. Personally, I try to be as humble as a High Elf can be. (But it's hard when you're just so damn suave.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I think that a Paladin's chosen deity (or in some cases, the deity that chose them) affects how they act, but doesn't change their behavior drastically. For example, a Paladin of Brell may not mind helping out someone in a losing battle with a wolf, while a Paladin of Tunare might be a little more hesitant.<br>
<br>
Personally, I like to try to help everyone I see, as long as they're not evil, or doing something evil. I'll heal those who are running from mobs or about to die, but just as much as the situation dictates. I'll get them out of immediate danger, but let them take care of themselves beyond that unless they specifically ask for more help and I am not busy with something more urgent. If it's within my power, I'll drop everything to help someone who is lost, or has a question, or help with a quest. I think Paladins should be counted on to provide assistance, even though it's not officially stated that they'll stop to help everyone. Even if no one else will help you, a Paladin should always be there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubalidin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balidin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Holy Defender</span><br>  Posts: 772<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(8/4/02 8:28:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://saedyan.freeservers.com/images/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What *is* a Paladin?</span><hr size=1> What characterizes a Paladin?<br>

It's a very very sad thing with guilds like sedition pandemonium lex invictus just to name a couple.  Races and Classess haven't been a portion of roleplaying since kunark came out long before velious when Pandemonium was first introduced being a &quot;4 team guild&quot; where anyone of any race or class can join given they are of sufficient lvl.<br>
<br>
Myself i have always considered the roleplaying aspect of the game and a paladin to me does for the good of all people peoples of the lands fighting and defending forwgat  is right and holy.  fighting for those that cannot fight or aiding those in need of aid. Not necessarily offering assistance to every single person you come across, but more that seem to need assistance to survive a fight &lt;npc or pc&gt;. Everyone needs to learn how to not beg or plead for items to be given to them but to show them how they can earn it for themselves &lt;take a newbie to a spawn and give him/her a rusty weapon and say kill these you'll gain life experience and items you can sell to merchants for coin&gt; and if they start whining and complaining or saying i'm to lazy you let them know that if they cannot survive without help they cannot survive period, but you have aided them shown them the path in which to lead to victories and wealth.<br>
<br>
A paladin is more a warrior than a cleric so to step up as a knight of the holy light and take a beating from a mob or another player to save a caster your cleric your rogue.. that is a true paladin..... fight first and if someone is in trouble step back give them a quick heal or our god sent LoH to save them and continue fighting so after the fight is over you can play the clerical part of the class..... a true paladin is free giving of his/her LoH to anyone in serious need of it. &lt; cleric is LoM or oom.. no cleric around and shammy is LoM or oom .. so on so forth&gt; <br>
<br>
These &quot;4 team guilds&quot;<br>
 survive on tallon zek because they fight in numbers and with all classess and races available to them they are strong a united norrath.  But the implications of them have far destroyed any possibility of roleplaying and it's just sad.<br>
<br>
I have been on tallon zek for 3 years since 3 weeks after eq went live. I have 2 charecters one lvl 56 paladin and 1 lvl 14 cleric.... why only lvl 14? because i enjoy playing my paladin so much that i have no need or want to play any other class.... it might make me nieve or ignorant when it comes to other classess but there's a server full of players who will tell you i probably play a paladin better than anyone else on the server... I'm not the strongest i'm not the best equipped and I may not even be the best pvp'r I can take down lvl 60's with epics and ntov gear on a good day and i have my fair share of lossess as well. But i know the feeling i get when i help some lvl 30 get in thier eyes when i help them get an UBER piece of gear which to me is merchant junk. Or the &quot; YOUR A GOD&quot; because i loh'd some poor bastard getting beat on by another player or by an npc and i saved their life and xp. when all i was doing was passing thru to get to another zone. To toss a couple plats to some newb lvl 5 druid so they can buy thier spells so they can go out and fight and hunt. <br>
<br>
I think a paladin gone arye that being in a &quot;4-team guild&quot; should have a penalty or skill or spell taken from them... for instance THE FIRST PORTION OF OUR EPIC the soulfire.... who is the mob you need to kill to get the note to turn in so you can get your soulfire.... you guessed it that good ole fallen paladin human from west freeport. You kill him and he turns into a skeleton right after doomed to an everlasting life of hate.. altho he still uses and has his loh and other spells not that i noticed he ever uses them but he has a curse placed on him... verant should implement a &quot;curse&quot; for joining a 4 team guild to any cleric of light or paladin of light.... and to a dark cleric in a guild of lights and darks. <br>
<br>
I have this discussion with thousands of people every week on tallon zek because i dont believe in 4 team guilds.  &quot;It's not roleplaying in the true sense of what the game was intended to be&quot;  responses generally are &quot;This isnt roleplaying anyhow so what does it matter&quot; or &quot;I joined a 4 team guild so i can play with my irl buddies&quot; or my favorite &quot;because i like being able to kill anyone i want on the server&quot; <br>
<br>
my responses to each of those <br>
<br>
1 it is roleplaying... what do you type when you dont want your lvl shown /ROLEPLAY<br>
<br>
2 if you want to join your friends who are dark..... MAKE A DARK CHARECTER!<br>
<br>
3 YOU CANT KILL ANYONE ON THE SERVER ... your still in a guild with rules and you cant kill your own guildmates. So if you want to kill anyone on the server be un-guilded.<br>

in a pure RP sense, Paladins do what is right. and the only person who defines what is right (and good) is the paladin. Paladins stand alone when no one else will do whats good. They dont care what the odds are, they WILL do good... regardless how big the dragon who kidnapped the damsel is.<br>

Things may be a bit different on TZ than on VallonZek where I am but you really sound like a 3 team bloobie to me. I don't mean to say that like an insult, it's mearly how you play the game. Lots of people like to play light vrs. dark. <br>
<br>
Before I turned 4-teamer, I was an elven purist on my server for over 2 years. As an elven purist I killed anyone that was not an elf, I only grouped with elves, and only guilded with other elves. During this time I was almost always roleplaying a Knight of Tunare protecting the faydark from the other lesser races. What this usually got me what an instant KoS from other races (understandable), but also constant shun from non-purist elves because I was a &quot;Dirty Purist PKer&quot;. Regardless, I contiued to assist the young of our race with gear and money, and ward off those that would defile the forest, etc, etc. Many years later I see some of the same people I helped in the newbie zone when I was level 25 who took the easiest path to the top (3-teaming), and are way ahead of me in levels, gear, aaxp. I'm guessing 3-teamers all do a lot of rolplaying sitting in velks all day.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, looking for groups\exp spots as a purist is extremely hard. I constantly had to solo for lack of guildmembers on (the hard life isn't usually very popular), and always in low population zones. Usually 3-teamers would actually go out of their way to kill purists if they could, so normally I couldn't stay in an exp spot for very long. Imagine if you will, leveling from 20-52 almost completely solo while having to hide and evade from most of the other players on the server. Taking a pure guess on the server make-up, I'd say vallon is almost 50% 3-teamers, 40%-dark team purist, and the last 10% is split between all other catagories, such as 4-teamer, lighty purists, and the rare 2-teamers.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, you can see why after 2 years ending up at level 52 and in gear fit for a level 35, that I might get a little discouraged. I'm now in the 4-team guild Torrent, with a great group of people from all 4 teams, I'm finnally getting to see all the end-game content that I wanted to see for a long time, and I'm kicking lots of bloobie 3-teamer arse along the way =).<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, the 3-teamers on the server basically ruined the way that I wanted to roleplay the server. I didn't like the good vrs. evil idea, but apperently more people do and seem to want to force the idea on the rest of us.<br>

EQ makes the claim of having &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; but there is really only faction. Just had to get that out of the way.<br>
<br>
Historically, the term &quot;paladin&quot; refers to a &quot;palace guard.&quot; It's primary meaning descends from the stories of Charlamagne and his 12 &quot;peers&quot; or companions. They were noble &quot;chevaliers&quot; or &quot;cavaliers&quot; - the most loyal, fierce knights of the French king.<br>
<br>
The most famous of the 12 peers was Roland, along with his closest friend Olivier (or Oliver). Roland was brutally honest and fiercely loyal. He wielded a magical blade (Durandal), had a &quot;magical&quot; horn and a very intelligent, loyal steed.<br>
<br>
Roland is pretty much the prototype or archetype of what we think of as a paladin, and his character included the Fatal Flaw which most mythological paladins (perhaps with the exception of Galahad) have. Roland's flaw or sin was Pride and the tale of his downfall (&quot;The Song of Roland&quot;) was the most famous stories of the peers.<br>
<br>
There are echoes of Roland in other famous knights, such as Lancelot. Pure, noble and brave... but with a flaw (in this case, love for a woman).<br>
<br>
Interestingly, it seems that the relationship between a paladin and his deity wasn't an essential part of paladin-hood until Dungeons &amp; Dragons incorporated it. Prior to that, a paladin was considered holy in the sense that he remained pure and devoted, but his devotion was to King, not primarily to God. Prior to D&amp;D, a paladin was much more like a samurai than a priest.<br>
<br>
D&amp;D, I think, drew a lot of inspiration from the Knights Templar and other religious orders of knights - who historically would not have been considered PALADINS, as they were NOT &quot;palace guards&quot; or part of of the royal entourage.<br>
<br>
Most dictionaries are now much more ambigious about the meaning of the term and typically define a paladin as a martial person devoted to a cause. Religion might be the cause, but it could also be political or generically moral in nature. The Lone Ranger, for example, is very much a paladin in modern terms but he was not specifically religious.<br>
<br>
Outside of people familiar with RPGs (either pencil &amp; paper or CRPGs) the term &quot;paladin&quot; has become mostly meaningless. If you ask 100 people to describe a paladin, probably fewer than 10 will be able to define the term. Those who do will frequently make reference to the old Western series named Paladin (&quot;'Have card, will travel' read the card of a man... a knight without armor in a lawless land...&quot;).<br>
<br>
I was drawn to the paladin archetype long before I knew the term paladin. I started playing D&amp;D when I was around 12 or 13, but was a fan of characters like the Lone Ranger prior to having heard of the game. In fact, the first character I played was Romidar, whose name I based on &quot;Rom: Spaceknight,&quot; a comic book of the late 70's, early 80's period. (Rom had given up his humanity to become a cyborg and forever fight the thread of evil dire wraiths!)<br>
<br>
Religion and paladin-ly status are now tied up together for me, and can be pretty hard for me to separate. I also have a very hard time accepting non-humans as paladins and that is one of my biggest complaints about the 3rd Edition rules. I was annoyed at EQ at first because MONKS were restricted to humans, but paladins were not. Personally, I'd prefer that all paladins were restricted to being human followers of Mithaniel Marr because it sums up what I see as a paladin. I don't know how there could possibly be a &quot;paladin&quot; of Bristlebane - it's an oxymoron. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=231378">Romidar Trueblade</a>

The diety, in return, blesses him and gives him the ability to do things normal men cannot.  Not all men can be a paladin, only a select few...<br>
<br>
I also tend to think the code of honor is based more on the diety, than the class of paladin.  For example, Erollisi gives me a bit more leeway in dealing with women (You must remain loyal to your wife, but you are permitted to flirt and be friendly to women), than, say, Mithaniel (NO.  YOU MUST STAY CHASTE, EVEN IF YOU ARE MARRIED).<br>
<br>
A paladin MUST be good.  A paladin, in the EQ setting, cannot be discordant, however, he may be neutral.  (With the exception of Sullon Zek Karana and Brell paladins. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
This is generally my outlook on the EQ paladin. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60479>Dalantia Dragonet</a><br>
