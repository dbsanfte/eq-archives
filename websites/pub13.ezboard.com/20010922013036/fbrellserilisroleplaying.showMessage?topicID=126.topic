Her head, unhelmed and cradled in Lanthan's arms, stared miles high into the black night. The words and tears from her friends were but muffles to hear hears, the blood clouded her eyes so much she could not even see Lanthan's face.<br>
<br>
Cazic's Knight of Fear was no more, in death her curse would be removed, and has such begun to fade away from her own fading soul.<br>
The stench of Innothule swamp rose up from the vile waters, but each Champion of Truth smelled the sweet fragrance of the Mother of the Elves. Fenye's chest heaved with each breath, her back arching and convulsing as if it was being stabbing in the spine repeatadly. A tear from Lanthan's face dropped onto Fenye's, saddened by all that has happened...<br>
<br>
He began to remember back when Fenye was just a young paladin, set out to serve the Mother as best she could. He met her in Freeport, when she was the leader of a new unit from Felwithe who dubbed themselves the Knights of the Magi. Fenye was traveling with her friend, Tilana the Barbarian at the time, and the three became fast friends. <br>
It was not much longer before the armies of Felwithe and Norht freeport coincided to join efforts, and the Knights of the Magi and the Champions of Truth were both awarded for forming this alliance. Lanthan, as the leader of the CoT, grew his guild strong and powerful, a mighty force to be reckoned with.<br>
<br>
Some time later, after a particular raid into the Temple of Cazic Thule, Fenye had changed. Her unit disbanded, and she became very evil, killing innocents, burning churches, salting farmlands. It was known that she was cursed, and to Lanthan's heartache, the only way to save her was to kill her.<br>
<br>
Fenye almost brought the destruction to the world of the Elves. Her powers had amassed tenfold, and soon her and Cazic would walk the Faydarks with unsurpassed power, had not the Champions found out about her.<br>
<br>
Now she lay here, defeated by the entire contingent of Freeport troops, her last breath drawing near.<br>
Lanthan bowed his head, caressing Fenye's blood dried hair, &quot;Champion to Champion..&quot;<br>
His troops knelt on one knee, removing thier helms and bowing, &quot;Yours in Life and in Death&quot;.<br>
&quot;Friends,&quot; Lanthan said as he laid Fenye's head across his knee, &quot;this once valiant warrior of Tunare will now return to her rightful place by her side in the afterlife. I trust you all to know that this was a dear friend of mine, and as such her body will be carried to Freeport and be put to flames on the highest pyre we can build. Let the wind carry her soul to Tunare.&quot; The troops sludged through the muck back towards the battlewagon to retrieve some wrap for her body. <br>
Fenye looked up into Lanthan's eyes, as if she was thanking him for setting her free. She blinked some blood away to know who's arms she was in. Her Soulfire, which was standing in the earth bladefirst, had only a few flickers of flame still burning from it. A memory of hers flashed through her mind, of when she recieved the Blade. How surprised was she went the dormant blade burst into brilliant flames, brighter than seven suns! Now it was merely adequate to illuminate a small room. She felt her hands and arms, her feet and legs go numb. Fenye looked up at the trees, and saw leaves rustling without the aid of wind. She smelled the sweetness of life. The numbness creeped it's way towards her heart, which began to beat faster and faster. She could feel Lanthan's strong hands clenching her tigher as he knew her last breath was drawing near. There was one tiny flame left alive on her Soulfire, and the blade began to grow dark and worn. Her heart began to flutter, and darkness began to surround her eyesight. <br>
<br>
Her Soulfire broke in two, and crumpled to the ground in a pile of ash and iron.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome home, my daughter,&quot; said a soft voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I?&quot; Fenye spoke, surrounded by a blissful scene of soft colors and the smell of the sweetest perfumes being prepared.<br>
The Mother of Elves appeared before Fenye, a truly magnificant being. Tunare approached with grace Fenye had never seen before, her long golden hair, piling with curls on top of curls. No sound came from her footsteps, and her gown flowed like the rolling waves of the ocean. Tunare placed a finger beneath Fenye's chin, letting her look down into her eyes. &quot;You are so young and pretty still. Because of Cazic's meddling you met your end hundreds of years before you should be standing here before me. I still have many plans for you, Fenye. Look here.&quot; Tunare said as she swirled her finger in a circular motion, revealing a picture of a frustrated young elf re-stringing her lute.<br>
&quot;This here is Llannu, a sweet, kind, loving elf, but a true fiesty one in spirit.. much like you were, Fenye. She has nobody to trust though, and you had many people to back you. She is just a lonely bard, and someday I want her to be as great as you were.&quot;<br>
&quot;What must I do? Surely I cannot reach her from here.. I am dead.&quot; <br>
Tunare smiled and wiped the tear from Fenye's cheek, &quot;My loving daughter, you are to have a second chance at life. Give Llannu the courage and spirit to become strong, and you will once again walk the soil of Norrath, and lead my children into valorous battles, and fight with heroes and slay mighty evils.&quot;<br>
&quot;...&quot;<br>
&quot;Go now, and show her how to live. Teach her mind to be strong like yours, her spirit as strong as mine.&quot;<br>
&quot;I .. am .. so happy you are giving me this chance. I will not fail you.&quot;<br>
&quot;Remember, Fenye, you are etherial in form, and only the people who you wish to reveal yourself to will see you.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The young bard looked up from her bench in North Freeport to see the great plume of smoke rising from a funeral burning. She felt a warmth she had never felt before... like someone reached through her body and touched her soul's heart.<br>
&quot;Hello&quot; a lighthearted voice said. Looking up, the bard saw a pretty young red headed elf.<br>
&quot;Hullo&quot;<br>
&quot;Mind if I sit down?&quot; the elf asked.<br>
&quot;yupyup, go 'head. Just stringin m'lute.&quot; The bard smelled the pinewood from the funeral burning, and looking up at hte smoke asked, &quot;who died?&quot;<br>
&quot;She's not dead.&quot; <p><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0><TR><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM>

Before that, I posted stories on www.everlore.com in the stories forum, under the headings, Knights of the Magi parts 1-4.<br>

post them here.  Alot of people dont post that like to read stories.  I just wish my english and spelling was good enough for me to write a feature length story. (sort story at best) I cant seem to remember the start of a story when I finish the end does not match the start so I dont write except to myself.  <br>
<br>
Keep them stories comeing and you lurkers that dont post but like a good story post and tell the auther that it was good or sucked or what ever just let them know that you are reading it at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
