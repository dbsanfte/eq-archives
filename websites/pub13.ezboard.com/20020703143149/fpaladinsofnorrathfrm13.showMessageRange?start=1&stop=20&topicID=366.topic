I've been hearing of enchanter NPCs mezzing parties and charming the MT to attack other party members.  Wizard NPCs casting IC and 750 point AoE rain spells, breaking mezzes.<br>
<br>
Of course, they still hit like warriors and have the HP/Mitigation of warriors, are still harder to resist then an NPC would be and harder to interrupt then an NPC would be.<br>

<br>
If this is true I don't think it is that bad.  Not only does it change the same humdrum exp encounter but it makes Paladins and Enchanters more valuable for spell surpression.<br>
<br>
When you have a strong group it is better to overwhelm the monster and let it cast its whimpy spells against you instead of trying to surpress them.  The &quot;group exp saving&quot; of using a stun to stop a 200 point nuke isn't that compelling.  However if the monster's behavior changed to where they are casting much stronger and much more dangerous stuff it suddenly makes spell supression important.  If you see a monster that you know that can cast charm then you better pull out a bunch of stuns to stop help stop it.<br>
<br>
However we need to be wary of them making it too strong.  A player charm from an NPC shouldn't last a minute.  There needs to be a penalty for not being able to stop a monster from doing their spell but not something that will break the group every time.<br>

<br>
I figured NPCs casting was lesser because they lacked the tricks players use.  Now they are.<br>
<br>
I think the added casting abilities and smarter tactics (charming, etc.) are fine, but then they need to melee like caster PCs (read: 15 damage hits) and have no more then 2k HP and 700 AC, to balance the new found powers.<br>
<br>
They can't continue to be 100% Warrior and 100% Caster, if that is where they still are.

Even with improved AI, AI will always be vastly inferior to RI (real intelligence =p). There will be quickly discernable patterns and players will always come up with strategies and tactics to work around them. If you had caster NPC's that hit in the 15's and less than 2k HP every caster mob in the game would be uber trivial. <br>

<br>
Totally agree.  My problem is, they still take just as long to beat down, since they still have their warrior aspect in tact, I assume?  They are also much more dangerous then they used to be.  They shouldn't have the advantage of major spells, high resistability, and Warrior NPC level HP/AC/Mitigation/Melee damage.<br>
<br>
I think the new casters will be a bit of a pain, breaking mezzes and mezzing PC's and cause more CR's, but I can deal with that as long as they don't equal a warrior NPCs abilities in addition.<br>
<br>
Essentially, basic exp encounters got more difficult (I would consider upping casters casting, but lowering HP/AC/Melee dmg an even trade), but the reward has not been improved to my knowledge.  That would seem to indicate a nerf to players.<br>
More exciting or not, exping will take more time, no? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/usirlageholyblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Lage Holyblaze</A> at: 6/6/02 10:38:58 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#666666><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sirs>Sirs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Noble Squire</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(6/6/02 10:55:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well...</span><hr size=1> It seems fair that, if they've FINALLY worked out a better AI for caster mobs, they drop the amounts of melee damage they deal dramatically...<br>

It might not be that bad.  Instead of skipping Fire/Cold Resists you now actively seek them.  Instead of going all AC in caster areas you have to do some resist gear.  Who would have thought that you would consider using resist gear against casters? ^_^ <p><font size="+1">

I understand that any change that seems to make things harder will not be welcomed by that crowd.<br>
<br>
I personally feel differently though, because I think over time the low level game overall has gotten too easy.  Yes I'm level 60 so you could argue it's easy for me to say that.  But even I had a lot of advantages over people who leveled up before me.  Big advantages.  The 40% hybrid exp penalty was removed when I still had many, many levels to go.  I had a lot of Skyshrine armor at level 55.  Even the rounds of melee class balancing, which increased Paladin's power dramatically, was done while I still had many levels to go.<br>
<br>
This isn't unique to Paladins either.  Just about every class has gotten significantly upgraded over time, to the point where soloing is often the best exp, and most exp areas with full groups are trivial to the point of boredom.<br>
<br>
Now that casters are getting their own round of upgrades, it will make things even more trivial--and probably more boring.  If the game becomes so easy that everything is trivial, nothing is challenging anymore, people will get bored with it.<br>
<br>
I think it is a smart thing to keep the difficulty of encounters in line with player abilities.  Doing it by improving the AI, rather than just increasing stats like damage and HPs is better IMO because it makes things more interesting rather than just longer/more difficult.<br>
<br>
I also agree with the poster who says it will be good for Paladins.  We are the first class to be put on Stun duty, and are the best suited for the role.  Making that a more valuable skill will make Paladins more desirable, without even having to make us more powerful in any way.  In the same way that Paladins were sought out as tanks in the new CT when taunt didn't work, Paladins will be sought out for groups in caster heavy camps if it now makes a big difference to be able to stop them.<br>
<br>
IMO trivial encounters = boring = players losing interest in the game.  The most fun I've had playing EQ were the really tough encounters, the ones where I didn't know if I'd make it out alive.  I'd rather have casters who keep my on my toes than a camp that is so boring and repetitive that the biggest challenge is not falling asleep.<br>
<br>
I do hope the changes they make work properly though.  I exped in Sirens Grotto for a while (enchanter mobs who charm), and one time some charms got through.  I was charmed for a bit, but after it wore off I was unable to hit the mob at all.  I was swinging away (not sure if I was getting miss messages since I have those turned off), but absolutely nothing was landing.  As soon as my druid and enchanter died, I could suddenly hit the mob again.  It was some sort of bug but my threesome died because of it, if I was able to melee I would have prevailed.  <br>
<br>
I hope these new changes, especially ones like charm and mez that do weird things that might not be all that well tested, don't cause too many problems due to bugs.<br>
<br>
I do understand why people who have a ways to go don't want things to get harder, but I'd encourage you to think about how much easier it has gotten as well.   <p><BR>

It was also not &quot;I'm a god because I had it harder than you do, worship me&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point was that the game is getting so easy that it's getting trivial and boring.  The only way to counteract that is to make things harder somehow to keep the game challenging and therefore interesting.  <br>
<br>
Improving NPC AI is in my opinion one of the better ways to do it, because the way to counter it is to use your brain and use tactics.  <br>
<br>
If they instead increased NPC hit points, AC, damage dealing, etc., that would make things more difficult too, but then your brainpower and tactics would make no difference.  I'd rather have the AI improvement, thanks.<br>
<br>
If getting to level 60 is trivial, what sense of accomplishment will you feel for having done it?  If it's that easy, all it means is that you put in the time.  Personally I feel more accomplishment after having done something that was difficult.<br>
<br>
I would also say that I really doubt this is going to universally make leveling harder.  There are plenty of areas with melee mobs to kill, and even among casters I imagine there will be plenty that still won't be that much harder than they were before.<br>
<br>
Also, as a Paladin, I suggest you take a minute to see how you could benefit from this in terms of the role you can play.  If an encounter is going to start off with a few mobs tossing Ice Comet at you, our Sanctification /disc just got another useful purpose--even if you can only use it once every 72 minutes, you might be able to break a camp that way where another class would have trouble doing so.  If stunning is more important to stop casters from casting, it will make Paladins much more popular in groups that want to camp caster heavy areas.<br>
<br>
In my opinion not only would this help the game overall, it also helps Paladins. <p><BR>

A Kor wiz nuked me for 300, which was different because they are usually 250 shots.  He also rooted me twice, which didn't last long on me.  I found they were less effective because they weren't chain nuking.<br>
<br>
It seemed my Cease was resisted more.<br>
<br>
I have nothing to really base this on since, I did not fight too many of them yesterday evening to get a real feal for it and I have no data to back it up. <p><b>Jonze</b> 57 Paladin

You basically insulted every Crusader - I felt obligated to defend myself.<br>

This post is directed to those who think EQ is their game and we should be happy they allow us to play it.<br>
I have gained knowledge from many an Ubber level on this board. and some lower in level than me. I was through the pre 50 Hell levels when they got smoothed out if you will. But I have no Ill feelings to those who might benefit from it.. I was only venting my frustration as we all do..<br>

<br>
We have now <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ideal</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> circumstances for the use of a well-designed, well-balanced TOK spell.  An AE stun with channeling debuff dot, an instant stun to interrupt with no damage, even just remove the recast delay!<br>
<br>
Our stuns are powerful tools now that casting mobs are behaving more intelligently, but I'd really like to see TOK un-nerfed now to go along with this change. <p><div align="center"><font size="2">Aragir Lancot<BR>

1. good things.. Epic's stun all of a sudden becomes a good thing<br>
2. we are actually more usefull in a grp now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
3. this makes things much more interesting and challenging<br>
4. we will now be the aoe pullers of choice<br>
5. the shield will actually have some decent use for bashing now (lets hope they actually make it usefull in other ways)<br>
6. all of a sudden resist gear makes a huge difference :P<br>
We surely need a friend at VI who knows us well (which we don't have at the moment)..<br>
To be honest..VI has def. made this more interesting<br>

<br>
1)  Bards and Paladins are more attractive to groups now.<br>
<br>
2)  I won't be the only person who carries his whole resist kit around with him and actually swaps some of it in on non-raid mobs.<br>
<br>
3)  More interesting encounters, at least until we figure them out like we did with the old mobs.  The casters <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> used</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be dangerous back when I was 20-40th level.  Then they became easy after that.  Now maybe I'll hold them with the same fear I used to have for them.<br>
<br>
4)  A lot of changes have gone it that made it easier to level, finally there is one that balances some of the mudflation by adding some new challenges.<br>
<br>
5)  I might actually find out what Sanct does, since I haven't used it yet.<br>
<br>
6)  Everyone has been slamming items with resists lately by saying &quot;Resists are worthless now, with AOE resist bardsong&quot;.  Now people might still seek out good resist items for use in xp groups without bards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=366.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=366.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=20><img src=http://eq1.castersrealm.com/pon/images/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=366.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.threadControl?topicID=366.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub13.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="paladinsofnorrathgeneral">General<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm13">Crusader's Warhall<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm16">Arena of the Holy<option value="paladinsofnorrathgodsmightroleplaytavern">God's Might<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm14">Norrath Classic and Kunark<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm15">Velious and Luclin<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm19">Alternate Planes<option value="paladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge">Tomes of Knowledge (Read Only)<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm12">Equipment Checks<option value="paladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests">Quests Forum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm18">The Inner Sanctum<option value="paladinsofnorrathfrm20">Squire's Yard</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/bpaladinsofnorrath>Paladins of Norrath</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13>Crusader's Warhall</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/pon">Paladins of Norrath Homepage</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
