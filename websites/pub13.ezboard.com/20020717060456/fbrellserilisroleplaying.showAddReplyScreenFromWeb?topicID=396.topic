making up and trying tot ie some answers into the way norrath is, along with explainign a stoary of friends and faimly and injust hatred. Enjoy. I suggest reading the prolog to know wahts goin on. Tell me what ya think<br>
<br>
<br>
Prolog<br>
<br>
     The Year is 1322 in Norrath, lands of common knowledge such as Kunark and Velious are all to be discovered, Dragons still rule mighty and undefeated and the alter planes still uncharted. For centuries a 1 sided war has been fought. A war between &quot;noble paladines&quot; and &quot;violent monsters&quot;. The War is known as the Erradication. Young adventures flocked to the Paladine and Warrior guilds to join in the casue of ridding their souther borders accross the deserts of Ro of the war like and technologicaly impaired neighbors, the trolls and ogres. Ogres were not targeted as threats but were known to side with the trolls in combat so were assumed Kill on sight. <br>
<br>
However trolls with there diseased green skin, and leathery skin and long teeth and ears were seen as an abomintion. Though no accounts of Trolls provoking any battles or confilicts are recorded, they carry the reputation of blood thirsty killers, who wish only to eat the flesh of their victims.<br>
<br>
Battles wage and the trolls lose ground acre by acre, mile by mile they are forced further and further into the swamps. Here the trolls found a second nemisis, the Frogloks small frog like creatures who have evolved unharased for eons into inteligent organised civilizations. The Frogloks saw the trolls as a threat to their way of life, when a troll party aproched the city of Guk, seeking refuge they were slaughtered by an onslought of frogs.<br>
<br>
The Trolls retreated to a series of caves which the dubed there new home, Grobb. In the deep swamps few paladines dared enter for many years, leaving the frogloks and trolls to wage war. Trolls grew tire of the sensless violence that had been bestowed upon them with such prejudice. Took up arms and two groups formed in grobb society, the warriors guild and the shamans guild. The trolls launched many assualts on the froglok city in vengence for their fallen brethren.<br>
<br>
The Frogloks frail bodies were no match for an armored trolls seemingly 5 frogloks to 1 troll were requierd to vanquish them.<br>
The Frogloks planned a trap to eliminate a large portion of the trollish army. The Frogloks sent a supplier out as bait, and lured a patrol aprt towards the city where an ambush had been set, the party was killed save 1, the troll hurried back to the city and informed the garrison, the troll army marched to crush the amassed froglok force, as the frogloks anticipated, as the troll army aproached the frogloks retreated deep into their city, the trolls followed fighitng their way through the labrynth, where the fleeing frogloks shimmied up a later, the troll at point climbed up the ladder to be struck by the serrated edges an assasin dirk, 4 more trolls died before they realised it was an assassin, after much debate, a veteran warrior agreed he would try next, as he climbed the ladder he chanted to his lord Cazic Thule, askng to tap his true power, as he aprocehd the top of the ladder he saw the he saw his assassin aproching he swung his arm with all his might unleashing a blast of pure hatred the assasin flew back flaming into a supply of food. Unknown to them the secretion of the mold was falmable casuing a massive explostion destroying more then half of the froglok city and berring the army alive.<br>
<br>
Survivors of the incident wished to learn this untapped power that the warrior had used and so started the shadowknight guild. That was the last majot incident between the two races, the frogloks and trolls only had minor skirmished and the former orginization and training of the groglok army had been lost seemingly forever.<br>
<br>
Word reached back to freeport that the trolls had conquered Guk with some new weapon. So continued the genocide.<br>
<br>
This is where our story picks up. the year is 1363, spring.<br>
<br>
Chapter 1.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seargent where are those maps!&quot; shouted General Markova<br>
A flury of soldiers scurried like roaches in light at the booming voice of their comander, in seconds his desk was piled with <br>
every strateigcal map of the past wars. He studdied them closely.<br>
<br>
General Markova was shrewed man, and reknown here to the citizens of freeport, clearing the common lands of the Drow and orcish threat and keeping the cuthtroats subdued in the southern deserts. He stood 6foot 1 in heigth, and weighed a little over 200 pounds. He had a thick balck beared and sported an eyepatch on his right eye, a clear reminder of the harshness of war. He was in command of the Freeport Militia, a time when paladine and militia fought side by side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ensign send word for my captains&gt;&quot; Markova said.<br>
&quot;Y-y-yes sir&quot; The young boy ran out of the room.<br>
<br>
A series of men entered the generals quarters and stood at attention.<br>
<br>
&quot;at ease men&quot; Markova said devoid of emotion.<br>
The mean relaxed and took a seat<br>
<br>
&quot;i've called this meeting to discuss the situation to out south. The troll army is on the move north, inteligince confirms the destruction of the froglok city of guk, they are moving North again, they must want revenge.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;But why? It has been nearly 50 years since any conflict has occured between human and troll. and a 45 year long war against the frogloks would be more than enough to squinch any warriors desire of war. Surely they must be content, what proof do you have of their advancements north?&quot; replyed Captain Trublade, a Half elf ranger, recently transfered from diplomatic missions in Kelethin.<br>
<br>
Captain Trublade was relativly short being a hafl elf, he stook 5 foot 2 weighing 120 pounds, though a master of the long sword he was no easy opponent, he assisted in the battle at crushbone, and defended the lesserfaydarks from drow invasion. He was well trained in melee combat, and was learning to tap his magical energies.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; proclaimed te general &quot;Our forefathers fought 3 for 3 centuries against those...those mistakes of life. the ravaged the homes of those outside the cities and murderd all they saw! and now you dare question our right to be alarmed over these besats! you have not the right to question me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As you subordiante i am obligated to point out facts you may have overlooked.&quot; The general snarled, &quot; There is no written history of the trolls provoking or instigating a violent act against freeport, they are all of eager paldines eager to become heros.&quot;<br>
<br>
The general slamed his fist against the desk!&quot; Obviously you dont KNOW WHICH SIDE YOUR ON! get OUT of my office before I ahve you arrested for treason!&quot; The general spit as he talked and a mad glow gleamed in his eyes.<br>
<br>
The ranger slowly stood upstraighten his armor and walked out of the office without saying a word. <br>
<br>
The general continued the meeting and had decided to send 3 garrisons south and would make camp at an oasis in the deserts. Tidus headed south following them and snuck past their camp towards troll territory to investigate matters on his own.<br>
<br>
Tidus snuck quietly across the souther deserts as sand slowly fadded to grass, orc patrols scurried the area in search of food. He was carefull not to be noticed as he saw a group of 2 trolls and an ogre engagin in combat, next to them was a few dead jackals, he wactched and lsitend as the conflict wage don the orcs shouting about there hunting grounds and trolls responding with plees of famine, the orcs unwielding with there food.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bumble! youz makes Fatalblunder now! youz hungry you want go to dessert look fer food&quot; the ogre exclaimed<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet otag!uone said you hungry in firstplace! if we live dis me kick youz fat...&quot; the senteinced was interupted by the thrid troll...aparetnly a female. <br>
<br>
&quot;Boyz! will youz stop fight da orcs not each udder!&quot; the female had a bit more wit then the young males. just then an orc blade ripped accross Runblebumble's arms sending blood across the grass, otag charged kncking the orc down and picking up his weapons wieling to swords the ogre went into a beserker frenzy, the unnamed female began to chant and a plethora of blue sparks shot form her ahnds and healed the injured troll.As if rejuvinated the troll grabed his shield again and rushed into combat.<br>
<br>
Tidus watched in carfull study as he quickly learned the ugly group was a hunting party engaged in a dispute over food. with a local orc encampment. just then he felt the sharp tip of a sword at his neck. <br>
<br>
&quot;get up&quot; said a deep voice, noticably an orcs.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish not to harm you orc&quot; said tidus.<br>
<br>
the orc laughed &quot;ou are in no postion to taunt me half elf!&quot;<br>
<br>
By now the hunting aprty had defeated the last of the orcs and Otag and Runble began to duel over who's fault the battle was. the female shook her head and looked around, with natural night vision she saw the orc and the half elf in the distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;boyz quick to da hill!&quot;<br>
<br>
Without hesition the party ran in an odd waddle, the orc lifted his sword ready to kill off the ranger, when otag pulled his bow and clearly missing but casuing enough of a distraction that in a blink of an eye the rangers sword were unseathed. He took one sword and jabed it into the orcs gut, then in 1 solid movemen flung his arm and decapitated the orc. Tidus completly his spin was met by 3 swords at this throat.<br>
<br>
&quot;DONT MOVES!&quot;<br>
<br>
Cheapter 2 coming soon.<br>
