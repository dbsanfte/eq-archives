<br>
I'd like to extend my personal apologies, as well as those of the raid leader, for that.  Ragefire popped early today.  The raid leader asked someone to check what time today's raid was scheduled for and was told it was 9:00 PST.  Based upon that, they did a quick raid and were out in plenty of time for a 9:00 PST raid to have full repops.<br>
<br>
Of course, that was the mistake...the raid was actually for 9:00 <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>CST</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, which occurs 2 hours earlier.  So, the repops will probably not have completed by that start time; they will probably be about an hour late.  There was no intent to deprive the legitimate FG raid of those spawns and we are sorry for the delay.<br>
<br>
While I don't particularly appreciate being successively called an idiot, a liar, and a sadist, I am truly sorry on behalf of my guild for the inconvenience caused to folks wanting to kill the FGs.  Our group should have gotten its act together a little faster and moved in at least one hour earlier, probably two for safety.  I will certainly ask everyone to be more careful of time zones in postings later. <p>- Cope -

Orri is right in the fact that CST is 2 hours AFTER PST not before.  I will say the timing seems odd.

<br>
However. <br>
<br>
Orri's claim is that your raid's leaders were specifically told mid-raid that you were cutting into someone else's FG raid and chose to proceed anyway - better to ask forgiveness than permission.<br>
<br>
So was this a raid that took place with full knowledge it was a violation either before or during the raid? And what is being done to solve the problem? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/uauelanlifebringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Auelan Lifebringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Traveller of Underfoot</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#CC9900>(4/12/01 4:25:55 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: An apology to today's FG raid</span><hr size=1> By the time we were told of our error in ooc, all of the fg's were already down.

I log on, and hear that ragefire is up. We make sure no one has fg's reserved...someone from the guild checks the boards and reports that the raid is scheduled at 9pm pst (honest mistake here, whether you choose to believe it or not doesn't concern me). We got in, killing fg's. AS WE'RE BUFFING FOR RAGE, Tangarth I think the name was ooc's about the raid tonight that we are interfering with. I have someone double-check the boards, and our mistake is revealed. I go into tells with Hadron, I think the name was, and start discussing the matter. He explains to me that although he isn't upset, Orri would be (he said you were the one after the epic, as your post in the other thread refutes). Hadron then refers me to Cougaress, and we discuss a possible reparation for your fg's being down. Ragefire shouldn't be involved here at all, since he isn't reservable. I refered Cougaress to an officer of Enshadowed, and the matter left my hands at this point. By this time we have finished buffing and go after Ragefire. Something happens, we die. During CR my DSL goes on the fritz, but we did take him out that attempt.<br>
<br>
This is the order of events. Whether you choose to believe them or not is irrelevant. What happened happened. An apology was made, and apperently you don't believe it...no skin off our backs. This is my final post on the subject, as I probably shouldn't be posting anything anyway. If you or anyone reading this has any questions about my individual posts, see me in game.<br>

Over on rants I accepted Cope's apology on AHO's behalf a few days back.  Technically I am no longer an officer of AHO, but I still accept it as its oldest active member (in any terms you want to use, sigh). ;p<br>
<br>
It wasn't correct of Enshadowed to oops on the timing, but I believe that is all that happened.  While it was upsetting to not see them up when we logged back a while before raid time, in truth the impact was not huge.  A few raid members didn't join because they couldn't afford a later raid, and this is the most unfortunate fallout of the affair to my thinking.  For the rest, the FGs spawned, we took em out (after they took us out, bards squish).<br>
It was reasonable for Orri to call attention to this and raise everyone's consciousness of not stepping on each other, even by accident.  <br>
Everything after that on all sides is just getting a bit out of hand, isn't it?  Please guys?<br>
