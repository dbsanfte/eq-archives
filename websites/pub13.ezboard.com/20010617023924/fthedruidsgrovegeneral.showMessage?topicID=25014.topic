Granted, I know I'm running from the mob and maybe they didn't see me, but how hard is it to target a mob and see that it's taken damage and look around to see if someone else is in the vicinity? It's not like I'm that far away when kiting. My question is this: Does this problem get any better at higher levels, or does it pretty much continue to happen?<br>
<br>
Also, an opinion. I've never dueled anyone, but the last person I encountered in this situation challenged me to a duel. I was lvl 20 at the time. Odds on a duel between a 20 Druid and a 21 Monk? Just for future reference. hehe<br>

<br>
if you snared the monster it looks like its not engaged - people tend to know that a running monster (agrod) is being fought<br>
<br>
SO they see a monster - target it and run up to pull it - since they likely targeted it at long range it shows full health.  If they use a bow - they never get close enough to get a health update - if they are SoW'd and they run up inbetween ticks they can even make it all the way to the monster before the health update registers on their system <br>
<br>
There is no way around this - shrug - you can send the person a tell and explain it quickly - if they can't comprehend it then ignore them - if they petition, you got no worries as you are in the right and the GM will get to explain it to them <p>Samita Littlethorn - Preserver<br>

It's just something I was wondering about at higher levels. I didn't know that about the health meter, so I really appreciate that input. It helps me to be able to guage what's intentional and what's not. <br>
<br>
In the one instance I mentioned, I ran up to the monk immediately and said &quot;Sorry, I was kiting that&quot;. His response was &quot;KS me again, and you'll regret it&quot;. I calmly explained that I had already engaged the mob and hadn't KSed him at all. It turned ugly immediately (on his part). And yes, I know there are jerks everywhere, that's why he's on my ignore list now. I'm not particularly thin-skinned, btw, but I also don't need a constant spam of tells about how much I'll regret KSing him. <br>
<br>
This monk challenged ME to a duel. So, rtfm, I guess the answer to your question is yes. My one regret is that I didn't accept. :-)<br>

<br>
It's true that much time another player can't tell that the mob is engaged even at close range, but when they hit it and it slowly turns to run after them, they know someone has snared it and they are cutting into someone else’s action.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say that there aren't jerks even at high levels, there are.  But most have realized that there are more mobs in the world than that one you both want and it's not worth fighting over.<br>
<br>
I've had people snipe mobs from my quad kite before and asked them not to help.  If they try to &quot;help&quot; me again, I let them have the other 3 from the kite too.  They soon learn not to mess with druids.<br>
<br>
As for the monk challenging you to a duel?  That just shows how uninformed he is.  You should have snared him, rooted him, and dotted him to death.  And just to teach a firm lesson, pull a mob on him (or two, three....) when he hits his last bubble of health.  If he Feigns Death to escape the mobs, &quot;help&quot; him with your least effective healing spell (will dispel his Feign Death).<br>
<br>
But that's just me.<br>

The puller makes a run for the hills with 2 gnoll on his butt.  So I give chase and end up killing the gnolls in the tunnel to Paw.

Do you honestly care what an intentional KSer thinks of you or druids?<br>

I think that gating to another area, because an intentional KSer moves into my area is a perfectly good way to &quot;go on, have fun elsewhere&quot;.

Alas I got my arse handed to me by a pally no less (damn stun bracer thingy).  It was close!   :)<br>
<br>
Secondly, if someone KS's you, just be polite.  In most cases they will apologize.  In the case of the monk (seems I know him too! lol), I wouldn't gate to another area, but he can only KS you so many times before he dies.  i.e. He pulls something, sees you kiting something, and goes to KS it, well 2 on one for a monk in SK isn't good odds.  Specially since at 20 I KNOW my feign death sucked and it failed half the time.  Either way, if he feigns and it succeeds you get the exp on both (since you can med while he fights and/or dies).  Good practice.  Happened to me in LoIO and I *think* the monk was trying to get me killed (on many occasions), cept he only succeeded in losing about 8 deaths worth of experience with no gain at all.  I leveled too &gt;:)<br>
<br>
Thirdly, never be a jerk to anyone.  I had a bad reputation for it, and I finally escaped my stigmata (everyone thought I was a lunatic when I started being nice).  It sucks not to get to do anything at later levels because you are known &gt;insert bad name here&lt;.  Im not saying be all sappy nice all the time, but try to treat people with the respect you want to be treated.  If someone does something bad to you, smile, nod, and move on.  They are not worth the effort.  Took me many characters and levels to finally realize that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f5e6><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub13.ezboard.com/ubraidfreak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>braidfreak</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#333399>(6/5/01 3:30:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kiting and KSing</span><hr size=1> a monk got owned by a pally?  that's just wrong!  lol<br>
