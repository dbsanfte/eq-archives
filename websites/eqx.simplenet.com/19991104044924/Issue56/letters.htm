The Travelers Tales were I believe one of the best things about this
newspaper! I have read all the stories but none have kept me coming back
waiting on the edge for the next issue. I really have to hand it to
Ozymandius they are great stories. I find myself now sitting in the
middle of the week thinking about what will happen next to Winter,
Maclir, Ozy, and the rest of the gang. Each tale has kept me in great
suspense. Each time you think you know what will happen there is a new
twist and you go back to guessing.<br><br>
    They have now been gone for 2 weeks! I thought maybe the first week
Ozymandius just didn't have time to write one or something but now it
has been two weeks without it. I know it isn't a regular feature but
there has been one every week for the past eight weeks. I was just
wondering what happened and decided I would ask. Any kind of reply would
be greatly welcomed. I thank thee for taking the time to read this.<br><br>
    Your Devoted Reader,
