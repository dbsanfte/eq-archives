I learned a lot in the land of Norrath on this day.   If you have a moment you could sit down a listen.  I only hope you receive a sliver of the knowledge I have gained.  Today in the land of Norrath I died six times.  How you ask?  Oh, no worries, I will tell you how my poor child!
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice I drown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once to a mob of Orcish brutes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once to a mob of Dervish Cutthroats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once to a Hill Giant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once to the poison of a Darkweed Snake
<br><br>
During nine hours of play this day I spent six hours within the last bubble of my 12th level.
<br><br>
I spent four of those six within the second half of the aforementioned last bubble.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I reached the 13th level.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I learned the basics of Duel Wield.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I have memorized almost every word to every good Garth Brooks song.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I learned the two most basic rules of life: 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) one needs air to breathe.  Come up out of the water every few moments lest you drown
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) don't pick fights with a numerically superior foe.  They will win every time.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I realized that girls are bad like my older brother has always told me. They distract us from the important things, like breathing.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I learned kindness when I donated little things to the young ones of the land.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I learned anger, at those who would kill my guards in the name of experience, and unknowingly hurt the young ones whom those guards were protecting.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I realized it takes a man to sacrifice and it takes only a boy to kill.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I realized how truly comfortable my chair is.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I realized that being a dark elf isn't all bad.  Right before this realization a Dragoon killed my comrades.  I had the same revelation an hour later when the Dragoon returned.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I realized I should have put my computer on the other side of the room.  My legs got cold from being above the air conditioning vent.    
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I learned satisfaction, as I logged out, still of the 13th level.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I came back to reality and odds are I will die tomorrow and lose the 13th level again.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I left the land of Norrath, and I came back to the real world.  
<br><br>
After nine hours of play this day I wished all I really had to worry about was that damn hill giant.
<br><br>
I hope you learned something from my nine hours of play this day.
