Well, it seems that a week wasn't long enough for you all to write any stories about those screen shots from <a href="../Issue101/kun3.htm">last week</a>.  And this week we have two more for you!  These are the last two, unfortunately.  We still want to read your stories based on these screen shots.  So how about it?  I KNOW there are some great authors out there.  Let's see what you can do.  Write something about any or all of these screen shots, and if it's good, we'll feature it next issue along with whatever the staff comes up with.  But get them to me (at this <a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">e-mail address</a>) by Thursday the 2nd of December so that we can get them into the next issue.

Here are the newest screenshots, with the links to all of them at the bottom of the page.
