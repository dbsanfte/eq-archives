  <b>Q:</b> When hunting underwater, most commonly when hunting the piranhas in 
  Rivervale for faction, my pet (I’m a necromancer) tends to suicide unless I 
  go up on land pretty often, and even then it might suicide. Now I am wondering 
  if my pet drowns, or if it's just another case of bad pet programming (which 
  is SOOO uncommon)<br>

  <b>A:</b> It seems to me that the waters of Rivervale are particularly clean 
  and wholesome, even life-giving and it’s quite possible that the shock of swimming 
  in such a clear river is simply too much for a necromancer’s pet? Or maybe it 
  actually feels a slight breeze of hope racing across the water that if it dies 
  and is reincarnated it could come back as a rabbit? More seriously though, I 
  don’t believe pets can drown and my guess is that it indeed has something to 
  do with the pet programming. You might try a petition and ask if others have 
  experienced this problem or you might try writing to Verant to see if someone 
  has an answer. (I think the main address for questions like this is <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>.)</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Dear Nepenthia, I used to be situated on Vallon Zek. I hypothesized 
  that on a server where the races were split into teams role-playing would be 
  encouraged. I had become sick of any well factioned human wretch being able 
  to walk the noble ways of Neriak, not just Foreign Quarter, but Commons, and 
  even past the Third Gate. I was wrong. PvP teams deter any role-player simply 
  because they eliminate interaction between two members of different teams. As 
  a Teir'Dal, Ogre, or Troll, this is less of a problem since the other races 
  hate us anyway, yet as a Dwarf it would be impossible to walk through Freeport 
  alive. It also makes it impossible, as a dark race, to interact as a villain 
  with the lighter races. Thus I began to think about moving back to a normal 
  server. I rationalized that it would behoove the Dark Elves to allow humans 
  and their ilk into Neriak if those lighties could be manipulated to do Innoruuk's 
  will. I re-created my Necro on Luclin and proceeded with the above mindset. 
  I was appalled to find that those indignant humans acted the same in Neriak 
  as they would in their own slum-like towns. They were disrespectful to Teir'Dal 
  and were unaware of the grace we extended to them in even allowing them in our 
  fair city. I.e. I was at The Lodge of the Dead in Third Gate and I beheld a 
  human buying spells. I told him I didn't remember when the Dread Guard had begun 
  to allow apes into this, most revered part of our city. His reply was along 
  the lines of " I worked up my faction man." I began to feel physically ill as 
  a strange feeling of De-JA-vu surfaced. Rather then engage in an endless cycle 
  I decided to come to you. My actual question, after all of this incessant rambling, 
  is can any of your vast Pillars of Wisdom recommend a server where a good chunk 
  of the populace actually role-plays.<br>
  Oh... and thank you for lending an ear.<br>

  <b>A:</b> I’m always glad to listen, even if it’s to a Dark Elf! Smile. You 
  might want to go take a look at some of the Everquest boards if you haven’t 
  already and perhaps even look at what my esteemed editors are saying on roleplaying. 
  Right now, no matter the server, roleplay is hit or miss. You might run into 
  a group of superb roleplayers having a great time and then move into the next 
  room where the air is thick with doodspeak and as you run screaming from that, 
  you might find yourself in the midst of mercantile mentality gone wild. Luckily, 
  you don’t need to be concerned about the dull factoids tossed around by powerlevelers 
  as they will all be far, far away amassing experience. So is there a true roleplaying 
  server? I think the Pillars of Wisdom would say no, not yet. However, I believe 
  Abashi offered a challenge that if players could present an outline for such 
  a server and a clear view of how it would run and how the roleplay environment 
  could be maintained, that Verant would consider it. It’s a huge challenge but 
  an intriguing one. How could a server be set up where you would know that if 
  you met a human in the Foreign Quarter that there would be an instant tension 
  in your conversation and a dance of distrust in your interaction? I really encourage 
  you to read the articles here in EQ Express about roleplaying and roleplaying 
  servers and also to look at the ideas out there on the boards and see if there 
  is a way you could help bring about the kind of playing environment you’re looking 
  for.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> In response to Whyte Tyger's question, my guess would be 
  that 'vie is an honorific meaning that someone is a member of the military/nobles/upper 
  class of the high elves. Generally, high elves are known as koada'dal, but if 
  you've ever gone up to the balcony and talked to the lieutenant, he'll tell 
  you that that area is for koada'vie only. Also, I forget where, but I've heard 
  koada'vie being referred to as the defenders of Felwithe. If I had to make one 
  guess, I'd say vie means you are in the military, firiona'vie being a military 
  outpost and all, and the koada'vie being the military of Felwithe. Also, I would 
  guess that it is high elf-specific, as I've never heard reference to fier'vie 
  or teir'vie.<br>

  <b>A:</b> What fascinating ideas! Thanks so much for writing. If you find more 
  to support this gradual translation of the high elven terms I’d love to hear

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Dear Nepenthia, I was surprised to read that your Pillars 
  of Wisdom could not help you with the question of how someone might go about 
  gaining mastery in a language without divesting one's fortune to his trainer 
  in the process. For indeed, the Gods have seen fit that this not be the case. 
  As a humble and usually financially strapped cleric of Karana, I recognized 
  early on my need to learn an assortment of languages. After all, how can I bring 
  Karana's message of redemption to the trolls of Innothule if I cannot speak 
  their language? And of course, as a cleric, there was no way I could afford 
  the funds my trainer was demanding for lessons. It turns out that a teacher 
  of a language may improve the student's skill in that language up to two points 
  higher than the skill level the teacher currently possesses in that language. 
  Using this fact, a pair of linguists may teach each other any language they 
  desire. The process proceeds thusly: First, two linguists with a skill of 5 
  in a language (awful) give each other lessons (spam each other) until one or 
  the other sees two skill point improvements. At this time, they both take a 
  break (zone) and begin anew. The student becomes the teacher until the former 
  teacher has gained a skill level two points higher than the current teacher. 
  After another rest period (zone), they switch roles once again. This process 
  can be time consuming with the required rest period (zoning) but it works. Eventually 
  both parties will have mastered the language in question. I hope this tidbit 
  of information will help any others who have an interest in languages but do 
  not possess the funds necessary to pay to their trainer.<br>
  May the winds of Karana whip through the skirts of many a half elven bardess 
  very soon,<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thank you for the very clear explanations. (See below for others who 
  agree with you.) And, thank you especially for the perfectly charming blessing 
  of Karana. Would you please do me a favor and when you are in numinous contact 
  with Karana, ask that along with the winds Karana send some skirts for half 
  elf bards. It’d be very nice :)</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> This isn't a question but rather a pair of answers ;) As 
  a wood elf bard I find my high elven cousin a bit disconcerting as to her lack 
  of memory for the true history of empires. I fail to see how the high elves 
  could possibly think they could run an empire better than the humans ran the 
  Combine Empire? Actually the human empire lasted about as long as ours did. 
  After all, it was the high elves who caused BOTH Solusek Ro and the god of the 
  Dead (I forget his name at the moment) to destroy their own capitol city of 
  Takish Hiz. (Now known as the Desert Ro). Ruins of the towers of the city can 
  be found scattered about the desert with the center of the city being located 
  on the island in Oasis. As to how to raise languages: No, you do not have to 
  practice at a guildmaster to a skill of 100 before training anyone. In actuality 
  you can train someone else exactly ONE point higher than your own skill. So 
  if you have a skill of 1 and have a willing partner the two of you could eventually, 
  by spamming each other, reach mastery from a base skill (on one of you) of 1. 
  IE: start with 1 person at 1 end with both at master. Hope this helps :)<br>
  PS: For more details of how the City of Takish Hiz was destroyed you can read 
  the journals of Ozymandius the Traveler (amazingly enough, his works are even 
  available on your website)<br>

  <b>A:</b> Well I’m sure the Traveler’s tales are illuminating but why he didn’t 
  pick up on the tale of the arrogant high elven tailor trying to dictate half 
  elven fashion I’ll never understand. Everyone has heard the truth of the matter, 
  I’m sure. If you run into him, you might ask if he has any more journals full 
  of his fanciful, errr faithfully told histories. Thanks for adding to the information 
  on language acquisition and thanks for writing.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I'm writing in response to a question in Issue 122, about 
  how a person got gnoll up to 100. One doesn't need to put 100 practice points 
  to get up that high, there is another way so here it goes; First someone puts 
  one practice point in the language, Then the first person gets with a second 
  person and teaches that one point. They pass through a zone line, the second 
  person teaches the first person in another point, you see until you reach excellent 
  you can teach a person one point over your max. Zone again and have the first 
  person teach the second person that new point learned and then another point. 
  Zone again and repeat. One can do this till you're excellent in the language. 
  Now maybe from here you will need to put points in it if you want a master ranking 
  but you won't need to use 100 practice points. However can you can get to master 
  in a language? I never heard of this before.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> The Pillar of Wisdom, Tagad, points that that any skill over 100 is 
  marked as master so I believe that mastery of a language is indeed available.

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Subject: EQX: Some answers to #122 that you might have missed. 
  Tithing in Neriak Question:<br>
  Tithing is the time honored tradition of giving money to the church. In this 
  case, Lokar To'Biath (The NPC in Neriak 3rd gate who likes Red Wine) wants you 
  to Tithe 70gp to locate the Scribes of Dal. This money is to be used to quench 
  the thirst of Lokar...err...the Thirst of Innoruuk. This tithe makes you more 
  much popular with the regular residents of Neriak (That's because giving money 
  makes people like you more). Learning Languages: Languages can be learned many 
  ways. One way is to go to your trainer and put one point into the skill. The 
  trainer teaches languages based on your level. You get to learn a new language 
  every few levels you go up. Another way is to find another player who wishes 
  to share that language with you in GROUP or TELL messaging. (SAYs do not work). 
  Another way to learn a language is to sit in the camp of NPC's that speak the 
  language that you want to learn. (I learned ORC by sitting invis in their camp 
  for 20 minutes) Btw, this is VERY dangerous. I would hate to be the first person 
  who learned Elder Dragon. But to answer the question about getting to 100+. 
  You do not need to go to your trainer and spend hundreds if not thousands in 
  plat to get a language to master. All you need to do is group with a friendly 
  person who has the same level of language as you and spam each other. If you 
  are not the same level the highest you can get is to the same amount as the 
  teacher. If you ARE the same level then you can spam them to 2 points above 
  what you know. I assume that from listening to the language long enough you 
  will pickup the diction better and become a better master at it. Then you both 
  zone and do it again. If you both start out at 1, then after many sessions and 
  50 zonings you can both be at 100! Phew! What a job! But the only thing it costs 
  you was water and food. Note: Since languages don't have a skill number associated 
  with them (Like fighting skills) it takes a little practice to equal out your 
  skills before you can start teaching at the 2 point zone.<br>
