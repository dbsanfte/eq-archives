He entered the hollow quarters with a slight brush of his hand, pushing away the entrance flaps to the dark enclosure with slender fingers.  His narrow eyes, both slanted from his elven genealogy and hardened by his experience as a swordsman, darted left and right in search for any sign of an opponent.  His muscles tensed, naturally sensing danger nearby and preparing themselves, while his fair elven skin shivered with anticipation.  Edril's cloak, a black hooded shroud wrapped around a layer of leather armor, trailed behind him as he began forward, hiding the movement of his legs and making the warrior look as if he were floating over the sifting sands of the desert of Ro.  Down his back cascaded long, silvery hair.  In reality he moved slowly and with hesitation, each step harder then the last, each movement his legs stiffening just a little more with a fear he had not felt in many years.  It was the fear that from this encounter he might not return.
<br><br>
	High above the flags surrounding the dark tent waved madly in the air, filling the inside of the large dwelling with an eerie drumming as they crashed into buffets of wind.
	<br><br>
His sword was first to enter, the single edged and curved blade was held outstretched before him with both his hands.  The unyielding darkness on the inside of the hut swallowed the sword as it passed through.  Edril made his way in slowly, the entrance flaps of the tent falling over his shoulders, and the thick shade of the dwelling fell across his body as well.  For a second Edril was just glad to be out from under the desert sun.  Still fearful for his own life, which actually surprised the elf, he was pushed farther inward by something inexplicable.  Something in the brief moments outside the tent, where battle still raged with tremendous fury, had brought clarity and focus to the elf, a feeling he rarely could duplicate outside the fields of war.  Something about his present encounter, the enemies before him and the enemies at his back, caressed the deepest parts of his soul with seductive fingers.  It was something Edril had fought with his whole life, fought and lost.
<br><br>
	The dwelling was for the most part nondescript.  His feet walked grudgingly across a floor of sand shaped by stones and gems into what resembled a set of steps.  The makeshift staircase led downward only a little into a sort of pit dug beneath the roof of the leather hut.  Surrounding the sunken level was a ledge that circled the entire enclosure where the bottoms of the tent were fastened and where innumerous candles danced and flickered with yellow fire.  In the center of the large pit was painted a red circle surrounded on all sides by similar runes born from arcane lore.  Shadows crawled up the hut's colorless walls everywhere except the far corner of the room where a grey throne of sand and stone was built, glaring down at the rest of the pit.  And on this throne, his form made black by the shadows of his house, sat Edril's prey.
<br><br>
	The elf made his way slowly down the stairs, now surrounded by the stone walls of the ledge, and gripped the long handle of his sword even tighter.  "Zisstrik," the elf hissed from lips that barely moved.
<br><br>
	Zisstrik the prophet raised his head slowly, his entire form slumped in the chair, and peered at Edril with tired and colorless eyes.  His lips curled into a nasty grin, showing rows of stained fangs, and his hands moved to the armrests at his side.  The troll's body, both thin and malnourished, was lost in the thick folds of his lavish robe.  "You have come," he said in barely a whisper, "you have come to deliver my demise."  The troll raised a thin finger into the air.  "He told me you would come."
<br><br>
	Edril said nothing and stood his ground, his sword positioned high next to him and ready to strike.
<br><br>
	"Ah," the troll's grin faded, "You want to know who."  Zisstrik stood slowly, his eyes suddenly burning with a hatred that made Edril's skin crawl.  "Trakanon, lord of the trolls, lord of all Norrath, spoke to me in my sleep.  He is the one that told me of your coming.  He is the one who said you carried death at your back.  And now, Edril, your name haunts my dreams."  The prophet threw his head back and cackled, his hands raised into the air.  "But we shall see.  We shall see who dies here today!"
<br><br>
	"You're a madman, Zisstrik," Edril finally said.  His sword was still readied unwavering beside him and his eyes, unblinking, were focused on those of Zisstrik.  "Trakanon left your people centuries ago and is probably dead.  Kul'ash admitted as much to me.  You know me because you have power, strange power.  But the rest is just an illusion."
<br><br>
	The troll sneered and growled, his fingers clenched into tight fists.  "Kul'ash is a liar and a fool!  They will all fall beneath the power of my lord.  Norrath will worship at his feet!"
<br><br>
	"Where is your god then, Zisstrik?  Where is the dragon to help you here?  If he is as powerful as you claim then why hasn't he come already?"
<br><br>
	"He speaks to me in dreams…"
<br><br>
	"But why doesn't he help!?"
<br><br>
	The troll looked away with a distant stare, his already tired eyes almost falling shut.  Zisstrik's voice dripped with a deep felt sorrow and apprehension.  "Because…he left me.  He left me because you were coming… because I was not good enough."  He looked back to the elf.  "But he will return when I…"
<br><br>
	"If he abandoned you then what good is he?!"  Edril took a step closer.  "Zisstrik, use your power to strengthen your people.  You could rule the temple in place of Kul'ash.  You could be a valuable asset to the kings of Antonica.  But this is madness.  It doesn't have to end this way."
<br><br>
	Zisstrik laughed again, his hollow voice ringing in the elf's ears.  "The temple?  Kingdoms of Norrath?"  The troll held his right hand to his side and a jagged edged sword flashed into existence within the tight grip of his fingers.  "They will all burn before me!"  Hot flames exploded around his weapon, crawling up the silver blade.  "And so will you!"  
<br><br>
	Zisstrik lunged forward with a quickness Edril was not expecting, slicing down for the elf's head.  Edril brought his own sword up to deflect the blade, parrying Zisstrik's blow with an innate elven grace and his own warrior instincts, and then quickly arced his sword around once more for a strike to the troll's neck.  Amazingly Zisstrik was able to bring his blade horizontally above him to counter the blow.  He placed his sword perfectly, slightly diagonal across his chest and above his head so Edril's sword would slide right off, and for the first time the elf noticed a faint blue glow flickering around the troll's body.  Zisstrik's newfound warrior prowess was magical in nature only.  Edril attempted two more strikes, both quickly slashing left and right across the troll's torso in one fluid motion, but found the prophet's blade blocking the elf's own sword every time.  The constant clash of steel on steel echoed throughout the enclosure.
<br><br>
	Finally Zisstrik took the initiative and brought his sword arcing down for Edril's legs.  The elf jumped, the weapon passing quickly beneath him, and then fell to one knee as Zisstrik slashed in a movement more quick then Edril had ever seen for the elf's head once more.  Both swords were locked together above Edril's head, the troll's vertically the elf's horizontally, and he felt the fire of Zisstrik's blade searing his eyes.
<br><br>
	"You cannot win, elf," Zisstrik growled from behind clenched teeth.  "You don't have the strength."  With a movement speeded by powerful sorceries, Zisstrik brought his left hand across Edril's face while his sword vanished from sight.  Grabbing the sides of the elf's head and digging into Edril's flesh with his claws, Zisstrik smiled and forced the warrior to both knees.  The elf lowered his sword to the ground.  "You are weak and so you must die.  Feel what true power is."  Edril felt his skin pull tight against the surface of his very skull, and tried to scream when he felt his entire face begin to burn.  No voice came though, and he tried fiercely to escape the prophet's hold.  "You will feel pain and I will be the victor!  And then my lord will come once more!"  Smoke began to rise from the prostrated Edril and his body trembled violently.  "Now die, elf!  Die!  Die!  Die!  Feel the sorrow you have delivered to countless others!  Death has been waiting for you!!"
<br><br>
	With a motion born only from intense desperation, Edril flailed his arm and swung his sword madly before him.  The blade struck the side of Zisstrik's lower leg and cut straight through to the bone.  The troll howled and reeled back, releasing Edril and shouting spells to the air around him.  A thick needle of stone shot up from the sand and struck Edril in the shoulder, biting it's way through skin and bone and out the elf's back.  The warrior screamed horribly, one arm limp and the other gripping the stone needle in a failed attempt to pry his body loose.  Zisstrik only smiled.
<br><br>
	"Your screams are like music."  His tongue flicked from behind curled lips.  "So many screams and all for me.  Listen, Edril."  The troll limped his way closer to the entrance of the tent while the elf shivered on the edge of the magic stone.  His blood trickled down it's rough surface.  "Listen to the screams from outside.  My minions die for me, give their lives to protect me, because I am the conduit to their god.  And you thought you could kill me?  You thought you had the strength to take on the lord of trolls?  No, elf, because I have power!  Power that you could never possess!"  Waving his arm in a single, graceful motion, the air crackled and stirred the sand in Zisstrik's pit.  An intense and unseen force was thrown against Edril, shattering the stone needle and sending the elf slamming into the far wall.  "You are but my shadow, elf.  A dark thing that stalks at my back.  And now you must die."
<br><br>
	Edril, his arm still quivering and blood running from the wound in his shoulder as well as down his face, sat up slowly and glared at the prophet.  His voice shook and his body trembled.  "To the hell fires with you,"  he managed,  "to the hellfires with you and your power!"
<br><br>
	Zisstrik chuckled.  "You first," he said and raised both arms.  The air around him came alight with sparks of glistening red.  From everywhere wind and power was stretched toward him, and the very air around him was drained of all sound and color.  An azure glow surrounded the troll's body as his spell was prepared and his eyes burned with an inner fire.
<br><br>
	For the first time Edril was faced with the prospect of his own death.  His mind and heart seized up with intense fear.  His reason unable to guide his actions in the face of such devastation and horror, the elf's instincts, honed for decades on the battlefields of numerous kingdoms and in the face of countless enemies, took control.  His hand wrapped tightly around the long handle of the sword which still was gripped at his side, and his arm innately brought the weapon over his head.  Pushing his whole body forward, his muscles tore and blood gushed from wounds that were beginning to close but his sword was sent soaring through the crackling air of the dark enclosure.  The blade whistled and twirled against the wind pouring from Zisstrik's oncoming spell before crashing into the troll directly in his chest.  Zisstrik was carried off his feet and the sparks around him faded into nothing.
<br><br>
	He landed hard on his back with the edge of Edril's weapon jutting vertically from his midsection.  The troll gasped several times and coughed up blood.  Edril picked himself up slowly as the troll writhed on the floor of sand, using the wall next to him as support, and warily walked to the fallen body with tired legs.  When he reached the troll, he pulled his blade out quickly and picked the prophet up by the neck with his injured arm.
<br><br>
	Zisstrik's eyes were empty and sunken and his expression bore the sorrowed visage of someone who knew he was beaten.  He spoke meekly as blood ran from the corners of his mouth.  "I…I can't feel…my body."  His head dropped to his chest.  "You've won…elf…you've won.  I was the weaker.  I…was…foolish."  He laughed and more of his blood dripped to the sands.  "Trakanon…was he ever with me?…The temple.  The temple…made me what I am.  And now…they've unmade me…their fault…their fault."  He coughed once more.  "Well played, Edril…well played."  The elf, his eyes filled with a burning anger from beneath a layer of blood that covered his face, raised his sword into the air.  "No…no please…don't."  Zisstrik looked up to the stern face of the injured Edril with eyes of terrible sadness.  Tears ran down the troll's neck and cheek.  "What am I now?…Just tired and old.  Not…the servant of any god…not the shaman of any tribe…not a fighter…not…anything."  He lowered his eyes once more.  "And I'm not the answer you seek Edril.  I'm not the answer to your burning enigma.  Because the life of a tired troll means nothing…and your answer…cannot be found…in death."
<br><br>
	Edril raised his own stinging eyes and loosened his grip as the words of the past elven emperor Carandril, the only true friend the warrior ever had, raced to him from the mouth of the beaten troll.  The realization hit him that he in fact wasn't going to kill Zisstrik to appease his anger, nor to please the high priest Kul'ash.  Edril found within himself that part he feared and loathed most horribly, that part he could not live without.  And along the troll's slumped and withered form, now vulnerable and dying, Edril saw the images of his own wife and child and the curse he would bring to them all because it was the curse he brought with him everywhere.  It was the curse of death.  Edril fought within himself to return to the soldier deep inside, the same man his wife had grown to love and others had grown to respect.  He fought for his humanity, as killing the troll would only serve to quench the elf's own taste for blood.  Zisstrik's passing would only send Edril further into the oblivion the warrior had carved within himself, that space deep within the elf's soul that was left void and kept him searching for an answer that would never come.  An answer about himself that he sought only on the fields of the dead, in the blood of his fallen, in the cries of his enemies, in the sword at his side.
<br><br>
	But that unanswerable part of himself was too strong, and something inside Edril snapped taught once more.  His mind was clear, his muscles ached no more, and his eyes were filled with all the loathing and hatred of a hunter and a killer.  Edril lost yet again that battle within himself and brought his blade down against the neck of the prostrated troll, denying himself once more the truth of his soul and the peace he wrongly sought through war.
<br><br>
	His sword passed through Zisstrik's neck easily and the troll's severed body slumped to the floor.  The sands beneath Zisstrik, prophet of the great dragon Trakanon, ran red with his own blood.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	The scarred ogre and the barbarian dashed madly to join their companions.  Zisstrik's men, now fully aware of the attackers, were swarming over the powerful host of nine warriors.  Each cried madly for the blood of those who sought to slay their demigod, and the ever growing wave of guards was becoming too much for Jalic's men.  Three of the warriors, all part of the command under the troll warrior Snargob who still was fighting to the bitter end with one soldier at his side, had already been overwhelmed and slain.
<br><br>
	"Come on, Grom!"  Aryn yelled as he crashed into a host of guards attacking one of their companions: the ogre Kugrokh.  This ogre, now fighting all by himself, had lost his weapon long ago and was trying desperately to keep away four trollish swordsman with only his bare fists.  New wounds ran over his body, carved by the sharp edge of the trolls' jagged weapons.
<br><br>
	Aryn yelled to the desert sun as he began his attack, waving his large northern sword in wild and powerful circles, striking anything around him.  His blows were fueled by a ferocity honed on the icy fields of Halas, and the trolls were crushed before his frenzied strikes.  As the barbarian continued his run forward to force the guards back, Gromlyko separated from behind him to help Snargob and his soldier.  The dead corpses of his enemies were thrown from side to side, and the ogre advanced with a terrible fury, using claws and fangs and his axe all together for one wild and unstoppable charge.
<br><br>
	The barbarian tore through the next host of trolls he came to.  His blade cut straight through the necks of two guards before deflecting the blade of a third.  This guard he cut straight across the middle, slicing the stomach open, and then brought his sword once more down between the troll's neck and shoulder.  But before he could complete the kill with a last strike, the sword of another guard found it's way into the barbarian's back, cutting through skin with sharp impressions of intense pain.  Aryn's mouth fell open in a silent scream, he dropped his northern sword to the sands at his side, and the troll who had finally gotten to the vicious warrior forced the barbarian's body off his blade with a harsh kick to the shoulders.  Aryn sprawled to the dirt and turned slowly around, his eyes searching for the one who would be his killer, while horrible anguish seeped through every fiber of his body.
<br><br>
	The unfamiliar troll behind him glared and raised his sword for one final strike.  Suddenly the guard's form was wrapped in a powerful light and flashes of something that seered the troll's flesh danced around and through his body.  The lightning jumped from limb to limb and the guard's skin was burned away in a billow of black smoke, his jaw dropping open.  The charred skeleton of Aryn's would-be-killer crumbled into the dirt, leaving behind it the form of Jalic the troll shaman, who ended his spell with a wave of his hands and a slight grin across his lips.
<br><br>
	"You're a lucky one, barbarian," the shaman said in his customary deep throated tone.
<br><br>
	Aryn forced himself to his knees.  "Only because of you, Jalic.  Now let's…"
<br><br>
	The barbarian's own gruff voice was interrupted by a loud whistle that tore through the air and wind overhead.  The warriors each looked up and saw the faint outlines of dozens of long, black shafts against the cloudless sky begin their descent.  From somewhere high along the ridge of the valley camp the arrows fell, their whistle becoming a scream, and rained down across the base of the camp, their knife edged points tearing into whatever they could find.  Most of the arrows just struck the gathered troll guards, but several slammed into the defenseless bodies of the remaining temple warriors.  Kugrokh was hit in the leg, the arrow passing straight through the limb and forcing the mighty ogre to the ground, while Jalic fell back as a shaft bit into his left shoulder.  Snargob was struck in the stomach and the warrior reeled forward, and his soldier was hit in the neck by an arrow that almost spelled instantaneous death.  Gromlyko, still trying to fight madly, was hit by two arrows: one in the leg and one in the arm.  The ogre stumbled forward with howls of pain.  Aryn, the only one left unscathed, peered to the valley's horizon and saw a long row of so far hidden troll archers draw a second round of arrows from the sand.  
<br><br>
	Jalic slowly propped himself up on one elbow and looked to the barbarian.  "What do we do now?" he asked, his mind absent of any plan.
<br><br>
	Aryn kept his gaze focused on the valley's edge, where the archers readied the arrows in their bows and locked eyes with the warriors below them.  All around the camp other troll guards began to scatter.  "Now we die."  He concluded as the trolls drew the strings on their weapons taught and prepared to fire once again.
<br><br>
	The powerful voice erupted from the very center of the camp.  "STOP!" it cried and everyone, even the archers and the fallen warriors, turned their heads in amazement.  Edril, his legs shaking and only one eye open from under a layer of his own blood, limped his way out from the confines of the dark tent of Zisstrik while looks of dismay and horror crossed the face of every guard in the valley.  His black form was outlined by the evening sun at his back.  Behind him he dragged his sword in the sand, and his cloak billowed in the wind as he made his way slowly forward.  He spoke to everyone gathered in a voice that bounced off every wall in the desert camp, even though his eyes did not move at all.  "YOUR PROPHET IS DEAD!" he screamed in a tone that even made Aryn shiver, and then he thrust his right arm into the air.  Held dangling in his hand was the severed head of the lord of this camp, it's mouth and eyes open in a horrible moment of panic.  "IT IS OVER!" the elf finished as he tossed the head of his prey into the air.
<br><br>
	The thing hit hard in the sands below, kicking up a small trail of dust as it rolled forward past long lines of makeshift tents and animal skin huts.  Every troll gathered watched it pass with large eyes of disbelief before falling to the sands themselves, their weapons dropped and their heads in their hands.  A loud cry erupted from the valley and slowly faded into nothing.
<br><br>
	Aryn picked himself up shakily, the wind through his red hair and beard being the only sound that came to his ears.  All around him the guards of the prophet, even the archers, had collapsed and remained sobbing to the dirt below them.  He smiled once, thankful to the gods for his own safety, and then turned his head to Edril.
<br><br>
	The elf, whose face was covered with a grim stare, stood motionless as his blood slithered down the contours of his body.  He fell straight forward and closed his eyes, hitting the floor of the desert of Ro face first.  Sands blew over his dark cloak and silvery hair, and his sword was buried in dust.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br>
	Somewhere deep inside the highest tower of the temple of Cazic-Thule, a dark monument of black stones cast against the backdrop of a grey and dismal sky, strolled the small and shriveled form of a troll who had lived for too many years.  The old one was clothed in the over sized and dark robes befitting a ruler of his stature.  The gold jewelry around his ears, neck, and fingers shook and jingled as he hobbled across his room of old scrolls and older mosaics.
<br><br>
	"What news?" asked Kul'ash the old high priest, his voice edged in poison, to the sentry who had entered just a few seconds before.
<br><br>
	The troll soldier, both very young and strong but still shaking in the presence of his lord, answered quickly.  "Zisstrik the insane, my lord," he cleared his throat to continue, "is now dead."
<br><br>
	Seemingly unfazed by the news, the high priest turned his head away.  The light from a large and nearby window fell across the wrinkles in his withered skin.  "And what of his followers?"
<br><br>
	"His camp has been destroyed and his followers scattered in every direction.  There are reports of mass suicide in some areas.  In other areas the trolls just seem desperately lost and hopeless."
<br><br>
	"And of my warriors?  How are they doing?"
<br><br>
	"The ogres, Snargob, and the barbarian have all recovered.  Preparations are being made for their departure.  The elf was injured more greatly, however, and is still in the process of recuperation."
<br><br>
	Kul'ash leaned with a thin arm against the stone chair to his left.  "Will he survive?"
<br><br>
	"Yes.  Our shamans tell us that his wounds will heal."
<br><br>
	"Good.  Once that is done pay him well for his services and send word to his wife in Qeynos."
<br><br>
	The soldier, whose ears twitched with confusion, spoke in a timid voice.  "Sir?…pay him?"
<br><br>
	"Yes," the high priest nodded, "he has earned it.  Our nemesis is dead isn't he?"  The soldier quickly agreed.  "Now leave me, Narog.  I wish to be alone."
<br><br>
	Narog the sentry gave one last respectful bow, turned on his heel, and left almost in a run.
<br><br>
	The high priest, drawing closer to the window, walked forward with some difficulty.  His legs ached if moved too quickly.  Once at the glass he peered across the thatched roofs of the tenements which constructed his black city of Grobb, the kingdom he alone ruled with a tyrannical fist.  Far below, anguished screams echoed in his ears and fire light from somewhere in the city flickered in the troll's own blood red eyes.
<br><br>
	Kul'ash the high priest, first servant of the dark god Cazic-Thule, actually smiled.
<br><br>
