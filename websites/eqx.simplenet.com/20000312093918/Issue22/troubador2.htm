Their principal subject was the praise of women.  The vocabulary of troubadours is
telling, for the most commonly used nouns in the troubadour repertoire were, in
descending order, love, lady, joy, and valor.  Often a troubadour would have a
single lady he used as his Muse, to whom all his poetry was addressed.  The
troubadour would also sing of the highest ideals of chivalry and correct knightly
behavior.  Stories such as the Song of Roland, an epic poem set in the time of
Charlemagne, and the Arthurian legends, which may have been brought over by Welsh
bards, thrilled the young nobility and guided the culture of 12th 13th and 14th
century France.

The troubadour was often a well-educated member of nobility or was sponsored by a
wealthy member of the nobility.  The jongleur was a lesser musician, often hired by a
troubadour as an accompaniment to his own songs.  Truly gifted jongleurs often rose
to be troubadours, while an impoverished troubadour occasionally stooped to hiring
out as a jongleur.  Famous troubadours such as Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who
may have been the first true troubadour, and Bernard de Ventadour, who praised
Eleanor of Aquitaine herself, were both poets and members of a warrior nobility,
not shrinking violets of the court.

The troubadour, then, differs from the Celtic bards much in terms of position and
training.  A Celt bard ranked in society below a priest (the druid) and above a king.
The training of the bard was exhaustive, and contained the complete record of the
Celt culture, whereas the literary training of the troubadour was less historically
complete.  Both, however, were the bearers, creators, and transmitters for their
respective cultures.  One could rightfully claim that the troubadour, with songs and
poems of courtly love and chivalry, brought us out of the Dark Ages and set the stage
for the culture revolution of the Renaissance.
