For once it was warm in the ButcherBlock Mountains.  A place where rain was common, though plant life was scarce.  Nothing more than durable pine and the tough scrub grass grows in ButcherBlock.  In many places a dwarf can drop his pick, piercing the earth only lightly, and reach stone.  In all other places the stone tears itself from the earth, reaching for the sky with it's thick fists.
<br><br>
"This place just screams Dwarf, doesn't it?"  Squire's mood was high, as it always was when he knew he was to be an integral part of some grand adventure.
<br><br>
Archanalia seemed put out by the whole affair, "Scream is an appropriate term."
<br><br>
The two were not the only elves that had passed the gates this warm morning.  And another approached at this very moment.  He was a Wood Elf, though not one that squire had met.  <em>But certainly he has seen me perform, or at least heard of me!</em> Squire thought.  He bounded away on his mission.  Archanalia remained in the shade of the great statue, praising it for its shadow while at the same time amused by it.  <em>A giant Dwarf...</em>
<br><br>
"Milord, you appear to be wounded!  Please, come with me, I know someone that can help.  A lovely lass, who would do anything for me.  And I, sir, would do anything for you..."  Archanalia was quietly pleased when the bards voice was swallowed up by the solid stone of the mountain as the pair of Wood Elves passed through the gates under the statue and entered Kaladim.  He knew what would happen next.  Squire would lead his new friend to the pub Kal where Laenilus waited.  She would help the man with his wounds, while Squire tried in his oh-so-subtle way to learn how he had been wounded.  And eventually the man would point out where he had been attacked on the map that Squire had in his pack, though likely more due to the charm of the druid and her healing skills than the ramblings of the bard.
<br><br>
Archanalia shook his head.  They had healed, fed and liquored-up twelve groups of adventurers since yesterday morning.  Two of them were just in over their heads with the local Orc tribes.  One group, the remainder of which looked so pathetic that it almost made Archanalia guffaw, were unlucky enough to stumble into the den of a very excitable skunk.  This was apparently one of the very large ones that live in the area, and she had just birthed her pups.  It was then that Archanalia decided that Squire no longer needed his help escorting the victims to their savior.
<br><br>
Still, he was impressed at how well the young bard had masked his displeasure at the terrible smell and cheerfully greeted the disheveled and embarrassed band of would-be heroes with a smile and only a few gasps.
<br><br>
But nine of those groups said that they were attacked by the undead.  Eight of those attacks had occurred within sight of the 'places of potential spiritual disturbance'.  Oghma was dead set on proving his theory.  And these adventurers were doing just that.  But Archanalia needed no convincing.  He knew that Oghma had been right, knew it the minute he heard the Dwarf speak it.  But unlike Squire and the Gnome, Mundas, he had no love for the idea of tracking down the source of this trouble.  Certainly he would do it.  And he was not exactly unwilling.  But he couldn't look at such a thing with the eyes of those two:  the young Wood Elf with his ability to think things were so much better than they really were; and the Gnome, so easily distracted from danger by things that he loved.  He quietly envied both of them.  But he would never trade his clear-headedness for their illusions.  He had seen enough illusions, or delusions, for a lifetime.  Now was the time to see plainly.  And now was the time to wait until they made the decision that he had guessed they would make two days ago.
<br><br>
Soon they would have to go and find out what was going on.  Leave the books.  Leave the safety of this stale city.  The only thing that remained was to discover where they were going.  That was up to Oghma and Mundas.  Archanalia was a warrior in his youth, his magical training had come late in life.  All of the tomes relevant to that training were written in his native tongue, and he had never learned to read Dwarvish.  So it was left to those two to discover the truth in some ancient, musty tome.  Archanalia guessed that it wouldn't take long.  With the general temperament of Dwarves it seemed likely that there would be hundreds of ways to upset them, even after they were dead.

"How can they just ignore this!?"
<br><br>
"Listen to me, Oghma, my friend.  I know that you are a servant to your king and you race.  I know that you are a scholar of our people.  I also know that you are right.  This does need to be investigated.  But as a scholar of Dwarven lore and the Dwarven people, you also know why they have some distrust of you."
<br><br>
"Who <b>I</b> am means nothing!  It's the information, the truth that matters!"  Oghma sat heavily on a stout bench made of wrought iron.  He hung his head, trying to collect himself.  His anger rarely came to the surface.  So rarely that he usually forgot that it had ever been a part of him.  But he could no more deny his heart than he could deny the Council.  As he opened his eyes and began to breathe again, more slowly this time, he noticed the bench where he sat.  He scooted back a bit to get a better look at the craftsmanship that his tunic and breeches had been covering.  Such fine work, so lovingly done.  He knew the origin of the twisted rods that formed the bench.  Not just where they were made, but which ancient craftsman had first used them in this way, with such vision.  The twists of the square rod added a fluid grace to such a solid piece of furniture.  Such a history our people have.  And such a love for it.  But we are so insular...
<br><br>
"Oghma?"  Grumal broke his thoughts with his gentle question.  Grumal had been a friend of his mentor Fergus.  Grumal had also just managed to get him an audience with the Council of the Six.  "You knew they would not listen, knew that before you ever entered that chamber.  You knew that they feel that their strength alone will keep our ancestors safe in their graves.  And usually that is the truth.  But now, somehow, that has changed.  I respected Fergus.  But I must tell you that you can not expect your people to have that respect for you as long as you insist on spending more time with... well... outside."
<br><br>
Oghma slowly raised his head to peer into the coal black eyes of the ancient priest.  He was hoping to see in those depths something to convince him that Grumal did not share the feelings of the Council.  Feelings that most of his people shared.  They felt that too much interaction with the other races would taint their souls.  In a way they felt that they were like the very rock itself.  As a whole and alone, it is strong.  But expose it to the elements and it would wear.  Wind and water would tear it down.  Certainly the stone would resist, and it would be years before the slightest wear would show.  But eventually the water will find its way into the cracks formed by the wind.  Then the water freezes, splintering the rock.  Once splintered, the rock is no more.  And even its fragments wear faster, ground to dust in such a short time.  And, deep in his heart, Grumal believed that too.
<br><br>
Oghma got up from the bench, saying nothing to Grumal.  What could he say?  Could he explain to him that Dwarves are not stone but platinum?  Platinum does not rust.  If heated it will flow and reform.  The elements will not erode it.  Made into art or jewelry, every person in Norrath will love it.  He wanted to tell Grumal all of this.
<br><br>
But he couldn't, because at times he was not so sure that he believed it himself.
<br><br>

Oghma found Mundas sitting cross-legged on the floor of the kitchen, buried up to his pockets in pots, pans, utensils and many things that Oghma could not immediately identify.  But he noted that none of them were the scrolls that he had asked the Gnome to sort through for him.  At first Mundas' bare head remained bowed as he shifted and poked through the pile.  The clinking and banging obviously covered Oghma's entrance.
<br><br>
"Mundas, I thought I asked you to..."  Oghma stopped short when his gaze fell on the table.  There were four stacks of scrolls, all rolled open and held open by objects on each corner.
<br><br>
"Oh, sorry about that.  I was trying to find another weight for the corners of the scrolls.  They tend to roll up if you don't weigh them down.  I guess you knew that, though.  I mean, they're your scrolls.  And you're a cleric, clerics know all about scrolls.  I wanted to use this rod, but it kept rolling off.  It hit the floor twice.  I don't think you'll notice the chip in the floor, unless I tell you about it..."
<br><br>
"Come on, Mundas, get up from there and show me what you found."
<br><br>
Oghma grasped both of his hands and lifted him easily from the floor.  Despite the fact that the Gnome was only a few inches shorter than Oghma, he was very light in comparison.  Sometimes Oghma couldn't help but think of his little friend as if he were a child and not a competent Enchanter.  Of course his speech patterns didn't help to change that image.
<br><br>
"How was the Council?  I mean, not how were they as in were they well or ill, but how were they as in how did they take the news.  I heard that Dwarves don't take bad news well...  not that it makes them ill or something like that, but that they don't like bad news.  Well, nobody likes bad news.  I mean..."
<br><br>
Oghma allowed the Gnome to ramble on, while he read over the notes he made about the scrolls.  Oddly, the notes were precise and thorough.  And in them, somewhere, Oghma hoped he would find the answers he needed.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
"So you're telling us there are three possibilities.  It just happens, someone's causing it, or the gods are doing it."
<br><br>
"That's a bit simplified, Laenilus, but you've got it about right.  There is some evidence that this might be a cyclic event.  The histories are vague, but there may have been similar events every one hundred or one hundred and twenty years.  It might be more closely related to the cycles of the heavens rather than the calendar.  And this might be just about the time that these astral phenomena again disturb the dead.  I would like Archanalia to look over our numbers and see if he can give us a clearer picture."  Oghma hands a bundle of scrolls to the tall High Elf.  Archanalia takes them, making no effort to open them.  His hands lower to his sides as he continues to listen to Oghma.  He is only peripherally aware that, without trying to, the Dwarf is using his 'bardic voice' and has entranced them all a little bit with his words.  In the back of his mind Archanalia realizes that Oghma is very concerned about this information, and that they listen to it.
<br><br>
"And we all know that necromancy is capable of raising and animating the dead.  But I have never read of it happening on such a large scale.  It would take a veritable hoard of bone throwers to cause the disturbance that we've seen.  Other tales tell of the dead rising when their graves are disturbed.  But again, it would require a lot of grave diggers to cause this level of trouble."
<br><br>
"And, of course, there are always the legends of the gods awaking the dead.  Tales have been told of Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek and even Bristlebane using the dead as their tools.  The real question now is, how do we discover which is the cause?"
<br><br>
"We go look."  Archanalia handed the scrolls to Squire and turned away from the group.  They all stared after him as he went.
<br><br>
Laenilus shrugged, "We don't seem to have anything better to do."
