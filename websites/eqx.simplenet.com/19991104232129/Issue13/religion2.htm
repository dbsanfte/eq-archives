	<big><big>I</big></big>f you are on your own, you need to read everything you can on your god and relate it to another deity on earth to fill in the blanks.  If you worship a god of war, you can look at Greek mythology for Mars  Your local library is sure to have dictionaries or encyclopedias of gods or mythology which can help. Mythology-specific web-sites are good too.  Find out what those worshippers found important.  Look at the gods place in the pantheon.  Is s/he a popular god? A hated god? What is his/her sphere of influence?

Most polytheistic systems identify forces of nature as gods.. The common threefold breakdown of these nature-deities as celestial, atmospheric, and earthly. For Example, the Indo-Aryan triad of Surya (sun), Indra (rain and battle), and Agni (fire). Mythic fertility rites usually acknowledge the vitality of the sun in the rhythm of growth and decay. Furthermore, the sun is frequently viewed as all-knowing, just as the sky is associated with creation; thus sky gods tend to be very powerful and knowledgeable, and mythic thought often associates creation with light. Thor, though only a god of storms, turns out to be the main protagonist in most Norse myths.  The divine mother who gives birth to plant life is a primary earthly god. The Greek Ceres is a typical earth goddess. Plants and animals show up in most polytheistic systems, either as a god or demi-god figure or in association with other gods as servants or symbols. Trees have commonly been regarded as having a symbolic relation to earth and heaven, especially in fantasy polytheistic systems.

In addition to the forces and objects of nature, various social and other functions, such as healing, seafaring, war, learning, or love, may be turned into deities. Gods concerned with death and judgment after death, such as Osiris in ancient Egypt, Yama in India, Hades in Greece, and Hel in Norse religion, are all very powerful deities.

Anthropomorphism, creating the gods in mans own image, is also common. With multiple races, there can be multiple images of the same force. The Greeks identify the gods as fully human in their thoughts and emotions. In some cases, human beings may take on the attributes of divinity, either through their manifestation of power or through their identification with deities; divine kingship was a characteristic feature of the ancient Middle East, the Roman world, Japan, and China. Cultural heroes have frequently been elevated to a semidivine status, and sages in the Buddhist and Jain traditions have become objects of cults.  Ancestor worship is particularly appropriate for racial gods, as many dwarf and elf fantasy objects of worship were noted ancestors.
