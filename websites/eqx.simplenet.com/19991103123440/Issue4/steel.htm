    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>I</big></big>It has come to my attention that there are many rumors about the practices and beliefs of the Children of Steel, and so I have taken the time to address some of these items and also to explain a bit about our religion.

<p align="justify">MYTH #1:  The Temple promotes war in order to further it's socio-economic and religious ends.</p>

<p align="justify">We, like most others, abhor war.  We are comprised mainly of smiths and foot infantry, but this doesn't mean that we enjoy the practice of war.  Quite the contrary.  There is plenty of use for metals in this, the Age of Adventure, and we are in our Golden Age.
</p>
<p align="justify">MYTH #2:  The Temple discourages worship of other Gods and Goddesses.</p>

<p align="justify">Any who know of our religion know that we do not worship a god or goddess.  We instead believe that steel is the earthly reflection of the souls of men.  We do not know who first created it, but we believe that steel existed in it's purest form long before gods and goddesses.</p>

<p align="justify">If one of our parishioners also believes in Brell Serilis, Duke of Underfoot, then it is certainly not our place to dissuade them from their beliefs.  Obviously there will be deities who's worship clashes directly with our principles.  I've outlined the Principles of the Children of Steel later in this document.</p>

    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="33%"><font face="boldPS" size="3">

<p aling="justify">MYTH #3:  Human Sacrifice is a part of our worship.</p>

<p align="justify">We have no ceremonies that promote the sacrifice of men, dwarves, elves, or any other sentient race.  We do not sacrifice animals either, for that matter.  This rumor may have come from the prayer of steel, which is said before combat, given time to do so...</p>

<p align="justify">"Steel in hand, sword my compass, point the way...to hell or heaven"</p>

<p align="justify">We are not sacrificing opponents, we are merely praying to the steel to sustain itself throughout the combat, and to the steel inside ourselves.  In the end, combat is decided by both these things.</p>

<p align="justify">MYTH #4:  We are closed to certain races.</p>

<p align="justify">The temple welcomes many different races.  While we can not boast that we have a member from every single sentient race, this is simply because our ideals conflict with those of some races.  But we accept the individual based on what they stand for rather than what their people have done.  This has caused problems in the past, as the original Temple of Steel was burned to the ground by a non-member who took exception to our acceptance of dwarves as members of the temple.  This was many decades ago, and we have since seen our membership grow together, regardless of race.</p>

    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="33%"><font face="boldPS" size="3">

<p align="justify">MYTH #5:  The dance of Swords, involving scantily clad women are held each new moon.</p>

<p align="justify">Sword dances happen annually, after the Annum Sword has been forged at the Forge at Orocco and brought back to the temple.  And among the dancers, clothing is optional</p>

<hr>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Our Ideals and Principles...</b></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The one principle we adhere to above all others is that steel is sacred, and that weapons never be left behind on the battlefield.  A fallen comrade's sword should be taken to his family upon his death, and a broken blade is to be buried and prayed over.  This is a soul, which shall return to the collective steel and be forged once again into a weapon or a living soul.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Another principle is belief that life is a trial of fire.  We are purified by each pass through the flame.  If in this life we do not attain purity of soul, then we return in some other form.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While the temple may not be an officially recognized religion in most of the world, as it does not proscribe itself to one god or pantheon exclusively, the Temple exists to extend our philosophy to the world.</p>
