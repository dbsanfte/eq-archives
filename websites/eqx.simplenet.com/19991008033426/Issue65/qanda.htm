<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest.  We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game.  This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only.  Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many servers is EverQuest planning to have?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As many as are needed to support the user base.  You can believe that Verant would be pleased to offer a hundred servers if it had enough customers to fill them.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you can only have 8 spells memorized, but is there a maximum number of spells you can have in your book, or can you have them all?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a finite number of slots in your spellbook, but it should be enough to house every spell available to you.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there places that only smaller races can go?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this was toted as an advantage for smaller races, there really isn't any places that are restricted by size.  The home cities of many smaller races would be difficult to travel through with a large race, but that is about it.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a Shadow Knight will you be able to cast spells while wearing heavy armor or will you have to take the armor off in order to cast a spell?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;All characters can cast spells regardless of what type of armor they are currently wearing.  Any limitations are hard limitations, meaning wizards cannot wear chain armor at all.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would a Gnome wizard be as capable as an Erudite wizard if each had the same intelligence level, or are Erudites better wizards because of class?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than stats, the difference between races could include the experience penalty and the skill maximums per level.  As for which is better, that depends on personal preference.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will EQ have blood in it? I'm not expecting a Quake overkill blood fest, but if you kill some thing will it bleed (or some thing similar)?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no blood in the way you are asking, but there are plenty of gory areas you can come across, with the bloodied, severed body parts of a fallen dwarf strewn across the ground, or a torso hanging upside down from a chain in the ceiling.  This provides great detail to set the mood of an area, while not making it so commonplace that it means nothing, such as in Mortal Kombat or Quake.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How hunted would a dark elf wizard be?  Would he be KOS or would I be able to enter most towns and buy things?  Most of my friends are going to be wood elves or high elves so would I be able to get bound on Faydwer and be able to live there?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark elf would not be able to venture far on the continent of Faydwer.  He would likely be Killed On Sight before reaching the boat in Freeport.  Dark elves are not welcome in the wood elf or high elf society, so if you wish to adventure with your friends, you should choose a goodly race.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you customize your character to the point that you can choose whether or not you want facial hair?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each race and gender has a selection of at least five faces, and for males or dwarven females, one of these should have some sort of facial hair.  The faces are preset, however, so you cannot modify them beyond that.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How does one go about adding more commands to the hot-button pad without overwriting the existing socials? The hot-button pad has 36 spots, but the socials only have 12, leaving 24 empty (nobody has 24 combat skills). I need more commands in the button pad.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hotbuttons can be used to hold any button, spell, or inventory slot, which can easily fill them.  Try putting sit, camp, run, or your long range weapon into the hotbuttons.  Oghma usually places at least one alcoholic beverage in his hotbuttons, in case of an emergency.  The only buttons you can customize yourself are the limited number of socials.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Gate is available to low level characters and Bind Affinity not until much later. Is there any use for Gate if you can't yet cast BF? Does it take you somewhere by default? Also, how common place is the use of these spells? Can you gate out of a losing combat situation?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you start a character, you are bound to your home city.  This is the default destination of the gate spell.  Bind Affinity can be used to change your bind point, which will change the destination of the gate spell, but it is not required to cast bind before using gate.  Bind Affinity can be cast on others, so a higher level character could bind you to a new city.  The use of these spells is pretty common, and you can gate out of a losing combat situation.  However, the successful completion of your spell is often a difficult one when in combat.  When you are hit by an enemy, you will likely be interrupted and need to cast again.  Only if you have a high channeling skill or lucky enough to avoid being hit during the casting time can you escape in this manner.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I make a rouge character and pump his/her strength way down will it affect his/her look? Also can you make your character really skinny or fat?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is no flexibility in the character models for changing the size in that manner.  You can not decrease your stats lower than the base starting value when creating your character, either.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am waiting behind someone, wanting to deal with a merchant, if that person sells the merchant something, leaves, and I walk up, will the merchant have that item on display?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, any item sold to a merchant will be available for other characters to purchase.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the ship available in Freeport makes rounds to all of the port cities, or just some of them? What if I want to go from Erudin to Halas?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat in Freeport travels only to Butcher Block, where the Dwarven hometown of Kaladim is.  The boat from Erudin travels only to Qeynos.  Beyond that, you will have to walk between cities.
