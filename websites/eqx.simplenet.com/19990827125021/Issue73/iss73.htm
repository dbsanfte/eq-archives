We are planning to do an 'all roleplaying' issue very soon.  If you have an article about how to roleplay, or what makes roleplaying fun, or something along those lines, or any suggestions about what you think we should cover, please send it in right away.  We hope to do this for Issue 75.  Also, please send us your art.  Now that all of the other sites are asking for featured art, it seems that we don't get any.  That makes me sad, and keeps Archanalia real busy.  So please, send in your art.

<b>Part One</b>

   Kinory ran along the forest floor, heart pumping, reddish-blonde hair streaming out behind her. The wind of her passage sang in her ears.  Her feet moved quicker than thought, flickering among the undergrowth.  Behind her, she could hear the heavy footfalls of her pursuer. Her heart was filled with the fearful joy of pursuit, her blood rushing madly in her veins.  She leapt over a fallen tree, landed lightly, and spun to search the trees behind her.  She was panting, but only slightly, her lithe, trim body corded with muscle from a life in the wilderness of the Greater Faydark forest.  He came out of the gloom of the trees and lunged toward her.

As most of us know, the Combine Empire is one of complete mystery. Much of the written records were lost or destroyed and, while speculation has proven interesting, no definitive theory has been developed as to its fate nor the lack of surviving documents.  This has in turn made scholarly work in this area virtually impossible, but nevertheless an interesting pursuit.

Rain dripped off my helm, and ran in slow trickles down my neck.  I don't think I've ever seen a rainstorm this strong in the Butcherbloks.  My companion Kakur and I had just arrived off the boat from Freeport, having ferried a human friend over to meet his new guildmaster.  Humans are an odd race, sometimes choosing to fight with hands and feet only, instead of donning good steel for protection and using axes and hammers.  Surprisingly effective, though I'm not sure how much good it would be against a drake.   All the prancing and jumping in the world won't stop that fire, it washes over bodies and really needs stout dwarven steel to stop it.

Who can want this dark enchanted stranger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portent of the coming world<br>
Is she my mirror, my own night splendor<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face I keep behind my shield<br>
And in her step I hear the calling<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of fanfare, the chants of war<br>
As she breaths, I watch the sun die<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shame, its heat so mild and low

It was another dark, foggy night in the City of Qeynos.  Nights like that always make me feel ill when I stay indoors, so I decided to head out to the edge of Qeynos Plains by the northern gate.  Try as I might, I could not find peace of mind sitting there… my thoughts collided, and I could not concentrate.  So I began to walk out a little.  As I traced a path near the city walls, an odd sight came into view.  It was as if the mist had formed an orb… dense enough to be nearly opaque.

I think I feel like ranting.  And I think I'll go after these so-called player events.  Check out the fan 'news' sites and you'll see what I mean.  It seems to me that there are only three types of player 'events':  Brawls, Weddings and Gatherings.  I guess I don't really mind those events that much (ok, I don't much like the brawls), but my problem is the way that they are being advertised, or, more accurately, it's that they are being advertised at all...

I just finished reading your article in article 71 "<a href="../Issue71/confess.htm">Confessions of a Role-Role-Role-Role-Player</a>" and I wanted to say thank you for stepping forward and declaring that you do value role playing above the mindless hack and slash I too often see in RPGs.  I first bought Everquest because of its potential of being a great roleplaying game (I've been a die hard fan of TSR since 1987) and was dismayed at the lack of roleplaying there was among the PCs.  It seems that many people are only interested in the mindless slaughter of monsters.  I stuck with the game and have since met a few others who share my views, and despite critics and players who maintain that the game is no more than a giant dungeon crawl, I feel more now than ever that EQ is a true RPG if people want it to be.  I hope your article inspires others to find the joys of role playing and am glad that there is at least one more person I know of who shares my views.  Keep up the excellent work.
