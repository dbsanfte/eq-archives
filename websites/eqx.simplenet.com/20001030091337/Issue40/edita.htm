Alright, now you've done it!  You've gone and suggested that we should have classes in EverQuest that are not primarily focused on combat!  You know who you are…
<br><br>
I want to talk about whether or not there should even be such things in the game.  Of course I've given this a lot of thought.  Disjointed and fuzzy sort thought, but though nonetheless.
<br><br>
Some of the arguments against non-combative classes are of the completely illogical sort.  Like (I'm paraphrasing here): "We're playing this game to get away from our 'mundane' lives", and "Who really wants to be an accountant in the game too?"  It's fairly obvious where the logic in these statements fail.  These folks seem to forget that nobody at 989 is going to require that they play a merchant any more than they are going to require that they play a warrior.  Adding these classes will not take away from the ability of the individual players to go out and whack the bad guy and rescue the princess.
<br><br>
There is a stronger argument against the addition of mundane classes and abilities.  It takes time to program these things.  This time could be better spent on making sure that we don't end up falling under the world if we turn left instead of right.  Resources might be better spent making certain that all the current bugs are fixed before new ones are generated by additional classes and skills.  And I agree with this argument.
<br><br>
Some folks simply claim that you CAN play a merchant, drunken sailor, beggar, or even an accountant with out the addition of any game code or skills.  It's roleplaying after all.  A good roleplayer should be able to take a warrior classed character and roleplay a merchant.  This is also an argument that I can accept.  As long as there is a solid code for trading safely in the game.  Certainly a fair roleplayer could create a rogue and play him as a simple beggar.  And if these non-combative classes are never introduced into EverQuest, I suspect that many people will do just that.  But just because it can be done this way does not mean that it necessarily should be done this way.  If all that rogue does is beg, he's never going to gain experience.  And maybe a beggar should be unleveled.  Certainly a true roleplayer could overlook this.
<br><br>
But I'm one that believes that a player should with the game system, not at odds with it.  A player should be aided by the game system.  It's not a matter of can and cannot, it's a matter of should and should not.  989 Studios is actively making it difficult to roleplay a mass murderer by including the switch in their game.  They are passively discouraging non-combative roleplaying by not including code to promote it.  They are encouraging adventure roleplaying by making it the focus of all the classes in the game.  This has obviously been their intention from the beginning.  And I'm certainly not against an adventure based game.
<br><br>
But I believe that there are good reasons to include non-combat classes in the game.  Creation of such classes would, obviously, include the invention of a method for giving experience for non-combat actions.  And when that happens we will finally be on the path to a true roleplaying game.  EverQuest, as we've heard about it, is a multi-player <u>adventure</u> roleplaying game.  I consider that added adjective a detraction from the title.  In the best of worlds I would be able to play a Troll fishmonger one day and a Half-Elven Bard the next.  Then on the weekends I could still slay the dragon and save the princess.
<br><br>
This is not a suggestion that the EverQuest team do away with the existing class structure.  I'm not talking about busting out with the make your own class scheme.  I'm convinced that this is not an effective idea for the multi-player on-line genre.  The freedom to be non-combative still fits into the class scheme.  Let's see some of the popular sub-classes from pen and paper roleplaying games in EverQuest.  Let's see a merchant based on the bard, but take away the singing and playing stuff and create skills like see hidden (keen eyes), appraisal, and bickering (begging that works only on NPC merchants and only when purchasing and selling things to net a slightly lower/higher price).  Let's have an alchemist based on the enchanter class.  Instead of casting spells he makes potions that have the affects of spells when used (I see a lot of balancing required here…).  Or let us have craftsman.  These craftsman need supplies.  They pay other players a slightly better price than the NPCs for items that they can craft into, oh, boots, bows, bags or whatever.  Give the merchant experience for purchasing items in one town and selling them in another.  The further away, the more experience.  He can hire other PCs to escort him.  Give the alchemist and the craftsman experience for each item they create.  At higher level these folks don't get as much experience for creating lesser items…
<br><br>
Ok, I'm rambling now.  But I hope that you can see that there is certainly a possibility for these classes to exist and to do so in balance with the others.  These classes would also help to generate interesting things for other PCs to do.  They would foster roleplaying a lot more than the NPC versions would (what was that key word again?  Bank?  Sell?  Aww hell…).  Some of the most fun I've had in pen and paper games has come from recognizing the needs or limits of NPC merchants and using them to my advantage.  If you do that in EverQuest with the NPCs you are abusing a bug and should be banned.  Do it to a PC and you'll probably both be having a great roleplaying experience.
<br><br>
Non-combat classes should be added to EverQuest.  I recognize the validity of the argument that there are more important things to do at this stage of the games development.  While I would like to have seen these ideas in the initial creation of the game (before I even heard of EverQuest), I can accept that they will not exist at release.  But I certainly hope to see them added with the first upgrade.
