"Perfect, just perfect," Jarak thought to himself as he pulled out a lockpick from his belt. He had been waiting outside the bank of Felwithe for two hours now. The guard had finally given himself a break, figuring that no thief could be THAT nocturnal. A rare smile came across his lips. A Dark Elf was at home in the darkness, and were therefore the best rogues. True, he had heard rumors that some Halfling rogues should be amazingly fast with their fingers, they lacked the night-time mind that a Tier' Dal was born with.

The tunnels beneath were as deserted as the ground above.  Aklar, Anthiel and Greygar descended slowly into the fetid depths of the Burrow, their dim lights flickering on the rounded walls.  Nauseating smells rose up at them as they made their cautious way deeper.  The uneven planks were choked with dirt and the occasional bone.  The place was as silent as the grave.

Almost all of my characters fall in the good to neutral range.  I've played Oghma, the dwarf warrior and dwarf cleric.  I've played Elanor the high elf cleric.  Arthedain the Paladin, Amlaith the ranger, Amergin the bard (lot of 'A' names there… hmmm) - all were good characters. I had some mage-types too, who were neutralish.  I picked a troll once for a while to have fun, but it wasn't a developed concept, more like a "let's see what the troll area is like" type of character.

<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Soon the world of Norrath will be full of people who play.  Who adventure.  Who seek out excitement and unique accomplishment in a new realm of fantasy.  Why, then, would name choices include characters from Robert Jordan novels or from books by other au courant writers?  Why use anime idols, or even the names of well known mythological adventurers?  Not to mention names that are derivatives of a favorite wine or the name borne by a real life person.  Why not play when choosing a name?  Apply some imagination, some creativity, some humor and some sense of the persona of the character to be brought into the world.  Then mix up the ideas, let them stew a bit.  Think of honors to be earned and how the name chosen will ring in the ears of friends.  Find the name that fits.

Shandar had been in the tavern several times since his last visit.  This time was different, however.  He came not to celebrate, or even to enjoy his drink.  Today he came to drown his sorrows.  He was trying to forget the man he once was, and trying to convince himself that he truly had changed since that day.
<br><br>
So, he sat at the table, quite drunk, nursing his ale and remembering times long past.  "Annudder drink pleazhe!" he yelled.

<center><big><b>So You're a Stepfather Huh?</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<p style="text-align: justify">
A couple of years ago I got married to a wonderful woman.  Not only did she give me herself, but she also blessed me with three children.  Yes, I'm a stepfather.  Stepfather.  Is that such a dirty word?   I use to think it was.  
<br><br>
My mother and father were divorced when I was just twelve.  She remarried soon after to what I called The Tyrant!  An evil man he was, whose every word was law.  I feared him terribly.   My stepfather and me didn't have much in common. Like most fathers, he didn't understand me.  Most of the things I liked to do, he didn't care for.  Most of the time he didn't approve of me (at least that's what I thought) and it seemed I would usually get either beat or grounded for most of the stuff I did do.

One of the most fascinating things about Ever Quest is the built in grouping system. It reminds me of all the Muds I have played over the years, inviting others into my group, having a private group send so I can talk to just the people I am adventuring with. Thus far my main character, a Monk of the 13th order, has spent most of his time grouping with people, making friends and doing very little solo adventuring.

I'm not usually one to complain about 989 Studios, now RedEye Interactive.  I suppose that I'm considered a suck up by many.  I'm pretty confident in my ability to see the truth, and so I'm not worried about misperceptions about me.  For the most part I have understood why and how RedEye has handled things in regards to EverQuest, and have agreed with most of their decisions.  And that may make me sound like a brown nosed little punk.

Okay Absessies.  I have a rant!  And it's your fault because you brought
it up in the EQ forums. <<g>g>  In case you want to do something with this letter, I'll try real hard to stay on topic.
<br><br>
It seems as commerical release draws near, more and more people are becomming concerned with Rping or lack of in EverQuest.  I find this real interesting because since I have started reading the Avault EverQuest NG, it seems to me that RPing on a general basis has increased, not decreased.

I haven't heard anything on EQ supporting kits for different classes, so I'm
curious how one would play any particular kit.  I'm sure choosing the skills is
the easy part, but what about other kit-specific nuances?<b>...</b></em>
