<em>The Guild's Place in a Virtual World   
<br><br>
Caban</em>
<br><br>
I have a very solid opinion about guilds as the are and as they should be in our virtual worlds.  I'm grateful to Caban for giving me the chance to rant.
<br><br>
This question warrants two answers.  First I want to talk about the place guilds appear to have currently in our virtual society.  Then I want to tell you how I envision them in the perfect virtual world.
<br><br>
As it is now, most guilds are a saddening and negative thing in the virtual world.  More like gangs than guilds.  There are several things that I see wrong with guilds right now.  They are specifically geared to EverQuest, but could probably be applied to any Internet community where guilds/clans/coteries pop up.
<br><br>
Many guilds are founded for all the wrong reasons.  They are founded by a person or persons with egos that need stroking.  Folks that need to be in charge of something in order to feel powerful.  On the other hand, some are formed with good intentions but with poor vision.  These people want to be involved in, say, and Elven guild.  So they form one.  But they fail to notice that there are already several Elven guilds.  Joining an existing guild is, in many cases, the better option.
<br><br>
Guilds almost always choose players, not characters.  While this is not always a bad thing, it is not really the best method for finding members.  It is the characters that need to have goals similar enough to band together, not the players.  This sort of recruiting starts the guild on a distinctly non-roleplaying footing that can set the wrong tone for the entire life of the guild.  Enlist in the game, not over the net. Having a great site does not make a great guild, and too many folks join a guild registering on a web site rather than by meeting the members in the game.
<br><br>
Many guilds are not created to mesh with the world that they are catering to.  I mean really!  How is it that the folks that are going to lead a guild (therefore, we would hope, somewhat more visionary than the rest of us) are so often unable to see that a guild whose name is taken from an infamous gangster rapper does not belong in Norrath?  It saddens me more when I realize that these guilds actually have members.  If the name, goals, guidelines and recruitment practices of a guild don't fit into the world, then why bring them there?
<br><br>
And with the hundred (can you believe it, HUNDREDS!) of guilds that are out there, no one guild stands out.  That seems to be a problem for some guilds, so they go about getting noticed.  They post to message boards and newsgroups as often as possible in order to be seen.  Sometimes they start flame wars for attention.  And as often happens when peer pressure gets to be too much, and attempts to get noticed seem to fail, members of these guilds will start doing the wrong things for attention.  They might hack sites and spam newsgroups and message boards.  Fan sites - even our beloved EverQuest Express - are often so similar to guilds that there is no difference.   I am distinctly reminded of the war between two EverQuest fan sites, ages ago, that so absorbed the community that it was all we heard about for weeks.  Ian Ash even wrote a <a href="../Issue2/flames1.htm">tale</a> based on the whole thing way back in issue 2.  While some times entertaining, these sorts of things are often destructive to the community where they spring up.  And their sources are the guilds that strive against each other inside and outside of the game for reasons that have nothing to do with the game.
<br><br>
Not all guilds are this way.  Some are created with the hope of enhancing the game, not just the members of the guild.  And that's the key to a future where guilds aid the community instead of tearing it down.
<br><br>
Imagine it.  An EverQuest society where guilds are formed by characters that have met in Norrath and found that they had common goals.  They have decided that they can't achieve them alone.  And they have decided that they could work together.  So they form a group.  Not really a guild yet, but a group.  After some time advancing their goals they find more characters that share similar desires.  They decide that their cause would be better served if they were to obtain some more substantial footing in the society of Norrath, and they purchase a house.  Slowly, they form a guild.
<br><br>
Already this guild has improved the community.  They have added to the game with their mere presence.  They have interacted with their world, involved themselves in it, and they have changed the people they have met.
<br><br>
For me, that would be enough.  But should the guild decide to move out onto the net, they could certainly aid the community there as well.  They could move their adventures onto the web with stories.  They could teach others how to form a solid guild.  They could simply interact with the rest of us.
<br><br>
I rant against guilds.  I have no intention of joining one.  But I don't despise them all.  I know that there are a few out there that have already formed that I would approve of.  And others will form, perhaps similarly to what I described above, and I will like them too.  But if I had to, I'd give a thumbs down to most guilds that exist before the world that they live in does.
