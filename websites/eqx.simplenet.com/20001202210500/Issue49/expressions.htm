<em>Considering the next issue will be on Halloween, I figured I'd ask something that had to do with horror and fear. What is "evil"'s place in an on-line game. Everyone hates to be tricked and deceived, how can you make people realize that is role-playing and not anti-social behavior.

This would probably be a tough article to write if one were standing right in the middle of a slaughter in Vesper's streets, or having just found that someone had used furniture to get into my secure home. It is difficult to call a cheap shot fair in the larger game when you are involved. We have to see the long term effects that anti-social behavior has as compared to just plain being evil in order to find the fine line. Being evil and being anti-social are indeed separate behaviors, yet they meet in the middle to form a crescendo of emotions that make evil what it should be. 
<br><br>
I recall that most of the infamous evil role players in Ultima Online belonged to groups who often used flaws in the combat system to kill their opponents, yet they still carried an air of a true role player. I am talking about the likes of Xavori, Magical Bubba and his motley crew, and others. I am not talking about the likes of the Legion or the League of Pirates, who were more focused on power gaming than role playing as an alternate aspect to heavy PvP combat. Sure, each group had its honest players, but as we have seen, honesty is sadly a forgotten virtue. Mind you, all of the above shared many things in common. All of them played on a level field, where no one could be a cheap shot behind the competition. 
<br><br>
I think that the number one key to being evil is consistency. The attributes of a player seeking to be evil are rather simple to define, yet not quickly achieved. These are attributes of fear, respect, awe, knowledge and tenure. Looking back on the first eight months of Ultima Online, the most infamous evil players became that way because they stayed at it. It was forgotten who used what exploits, and not as important as who got that "one-up" on the competition. It was the fact that over the trials of time, they were still there being evil.
<br><br>
A lot comes down to method and motives. How you do your vile deeds will have the greatest impact on others, either negative or positive. If you break common rules such as killing in guarded regions, or stealing from a player using exploits you are bound to be branded as a jerk rather than an evil role player. These are simple guidelines, such as "don't kill in town" and "don't con newbies".  I think these common rules are quite fair, and if you apply them to Ultima Online, not very many of the infamous players deviated from them.
<br><br>
Looking forward to EverQuest, a player who wishes to become an icon of evil still has yet to consider his methods. Doing something to be evil simply cannot give the warm fuzzies to the victims, so the would-be evil player must keep this in mind. He should know that when playing evil, he would make plenty of enemies. However making other players angry shouldn't be a long-term goal of the player, or even though he might have been an excellent role player, he might not have anyone left to play with. Also try to keep in mind that while actions are far louder than words, simple word play might have been the only thing that Magical Bubba did different than Thumper of the Inner Circle, separating them as a role player and a rabid player killer.
<br><br>
Think about what could be an anti-social act. Is gang killing lone travelers on the road anti-social? Well, even in the eye of the beholder is it considerably less anti-social than tricking newbies into getting guard-killed in town and looting them. Is haunting an unguarded merchant, stealing from the player-customer anti-social? How much less anti-social than haunting the banks and abusing the death system by stealing, being killed and looting your own corpse? When do you draw the line between saying "mother told me to avoid this part of town" and "this player is really detrimental to the enjoyment of others"?
<br><br>
Now consider what it is to be a villain. Is it thievery, murder or race-imbedded traits? Are you a dark elf, who kills everything that isn't a dark elf on sight? In that case by definition you are role playing. Is it different if you are playing a human who kills other humans? Probably not. If your character was a follower of a dark god, doing dark deeds and such, where is he in the wrong? If he were a Paladin slaying innocent neophyte clerics of his own deity <em>because he can</em>, I would hope the alignment system has provisions for such betrayal of honor.
<br><br>
EverQuest has provided the players an impressive choice of roles to fit into. I dare say that if the alignment system follows closely to the race, class and god lists we could even be encouraged to role-play by it.  For instance, EverQuest's Producer once explained that if an Ogre killed humans indiscriminately, he would be a hero to the other Ogres. He also explained that a Paladin would not be held in contempt by his peers for running down a Necromancer, but instead seen as doing his job protecting their way of life.
<br><br>
For me it is a more comfortable level of playing to start my character design at, being that I would have a few pre-defined allies and enemies to choose from. While this might be a boorish excuse for role playing to a few players out there, I have a hard time seeing how a race/class/religion based alignment system could be a true detriment to role-playing. Needless to say everyone will not be reborn a good role player as a part of their fifty dollar purchase of EverQuest, but the basis for logical roles in a fantasy setting has been laid. 
<br><br>
As for a role as an evil character in Norrath, everything from this basis should be easier to walk the line between being anti-social and playing a believably evil character. With all this laid out for us by the game mechanics we have left but to decide <em>who we would like to be</em>.
