<em>How can you make sure that the game does not quickly become polarized, having more evil characters or people playing a character in a rude, selfish, and or obnoxious way all the time. In UO, it was silly. There were no "GOOD" people. Oh there might have been a few people who once in awhile did some good deeds, but there weren't many if any good figures, but there were lots and lots and lots (need I go on) of bad people and PKer's. This type of game, where you feel harassed and not part of a world community where your actions and others make a difference and have consequences is what makes a game, especially an online game nonfunctional and quickly loses your interest (UO is a perfect example).

With my three months of experience with UO, I quickly learned that UO was not designed for the 'Good' players.  In a world where you can randomly kill who you please it was very obvious that you needed to be a cunningly minded PK, even if you were a good guy.  IMHO UO is a rpg for Quake fans.  Shoot em up  medieval style. Playing a good character in UO was difficult in the same playing fields as heavy PvP combat, and even those that had no interest in that playing style had to play by the same rules as those that like to kill others. 
<br><br>
Why EQ will not be the same as UO is simple: the PK switch.  For those who want to play with friends or  go on quests and have a fun role playing experience without PvP contest.  We can simply log in and play as we wish.  For those who like to run amuck and fight each other, turn on your pk switch and have at it with the other PK's. As for those players who insist on shouting and annoying other players verbally, there is the ignore feature.
<br><br>
In EverQuest you have a wide variety of races and classes to chose from.  From the High Elven Paladin to the Troll Shadow Knight, there will be something to please everyone.  This includes, but is not limited to, quests designed for your race, class and/or God or alignment.  The wide spectrum of choices will bring players of all kinds to the EverQuest community.  You have the die hard PK's who only want money and power to the very serious Role Players who would prefer a legendary sword over countless houses.  
<br><br>
I believe that the game will not become "polarized" as you described just by the nature of all the choices we have. Good players will be discouraged from acting evil because if they do, life will become difficult for them as they become a "criminal" in the world. Evil players naturally have a hard life dealing with merchants and NPCs, and often are not welcome in areas other players can go safely. On top of that, if evil players become "good", then other evil NPCs and merchants would see them as a turncoat. In my opinion this balances it out.
<br><br>
As Brad has said before, this is not Ultima Online. You are in their world now.
