<b>ANNOUNCEMENT:</b>  EverQuest Express is pleased, very pleased, to welcome two new staff members!  <a href="../credits/nepen.htm">Nepenthia</a> and <a href="../credits/aklar.htm">Aklar</a> have both been gracious enough to accept our pleading and join EQX.  You might be familiar with their work.  Both have been great supporters of this publication, and both are wonderful writers.  I can't wait to see how much better we are with them on board.  Welcome to you both, and thanks very much for joining us.
<br><br>
Well, the world goes on.  Time passes.  And slowly the release date for EverQuest approaches.  But over the last few weeks I've been finding myself playing less and less.  I guess it has a lot to do with the fact that any advances I make on my characters now will be lost in a week or so (yes, I DO care what level my characters are!).  Maybe it's because I'm finally wearing out on the game a bit.  Probably a bit of both.  And as my playing time has decreased, so has my attention to the community that has evolved around EverQuest.
<br><br>
So what does that mean?  Well, not much, really.  I'll be very enthusiastic about playing once I get my retail version.  I'll finally be free to play with no fear of a character wipe and without feeling like I have to look for every little bug (of course, it's not like I'll stop doing it, old habits are hard to break, but at least I can pretend I'm not looking).
<br><br>
But I am no so isolated yet that I didn't see that, once again, someone posted one of the beta news announcements from off the patch server.  And, once again, it was obvious that Verant did not intend for that message to be made public, but hey, what can we do?  That message was the one that asked for folks to apply to become guides.  It seems obvious to me (and I wish it was to other fan site operators) that the message was meant for folks that had played/tested the game and might have enough experience to actually be good guides.
<br><br>
What makes a good guide, anyhow?  Well, we all know what a bad guide would be.  A bad guide would be someone that can't keep a civil tongue in his head, regardless of how angry and insulting the player is.  A bad guide would be one that uses his powers (such as they are) to his own benefit.  A bad guide is someone that doesn't report well to Verant, or skirts his duties.  Any one of those qualities would make a bad guide.  So, then I guess the opposite would make a good guide.  Friendly in all cases, no matter how angry the player; fair; never abusive with the power given; and willing and able to do the job asked.  A good guide needs all of those qualities.  So if you want to be a guide, please make an evaluation of your skills before applying.  If you honestly don't think you can remain calm in the face of a cursing, abusive player, maybe you should not apply.  Remember, someone has to read your application, and that's time that they can't spend helping the rest of us.
<br><br>
Also, note that the minimum time that you must put in as a guide is ten hours a week.  That's a lot of time.  It may not seem like a lot of time, but it is.  I know that it's putting a strain on some of the current guides.  So realize that it's a lot of work to be a guide.  I've also been told that at times it's a lot of fun too.  But you need to be willing to put in a lot of time and effort to get to those fun times.  So I'm hoping that folks won't apply until or unless they feel they are ready.  I'm certainly interested in becoming a guide myself.  But right now I want to play, and I can't spare 10 hours of play time to guide.  Maybe in a few months I'll see if they'll have me.  But for now, I know I want to roleplay with a bunch of you, and I can't do that if I'm bogged down with all that responsibility, now can I?
<br><br>
And that really is all that I've got to say about the state of the game.  As I said, I've been sort of disconnected lately.  So I'll move on to something else. Unfortunately, tomorrow I won't get to play in my weekly pen and paper game.  Our GM has some lame excuse about babysitting.  But last week was amusing, at least for me.  You see, as a pack of werewolves we need a leader, an alpha.  I designed my character to fill that role.  But he has some weaknesses as a leader (above and beyond the limitations that his player brings).  And there is another in the pack that wants to lead.  She's a tough one, a warrior.  If we had to arm-wrestle for the alpha position, I'd lose, and lose fast.
<br><br>
It's been fun trading e-mail with the players, talking the big talk about leading the pack and trying to position myself ahead of her.  During the games we've been sort of ignoring the fact that we have no leader.  Until recently.  A twisted wolf, one of the Black Spiral Dancers, confronted us when we were weak.  He wanted to confront the leader.  While I stepped forward, I could not announce myself as leader, since I knew I did not have that position.  It made us look weak, like the pups that we are.  Not that the battle would have come out differently if I was leader, but the incident brought the problem to the fore.  We were all painfully aware that we were going to need a leader.
<br><br>
By the way, that one mutant Lupine fought us all to a standstill and managed to get away.
<br><br>
It was during the drive to get dinner that we made a breakthrough.  Our GM (lazy pig that he is) decided to stay at the house while the rest of the players (five of us) piled into a car and went to get him food.  He gave us leave to feed ourselves, if we so desired.  While in the car, one of the pack (and we really were acting like a pack of wolf pups, kicking and biting all the way) spoke up.
<br><br>
"Let's solve this leader thing right now," he said.  "Who here does NOT want to be the leader?"
<br><br>
All hands in the car go up but mine.  It is important to note that the lady warrior was not with us this weekend.
<br><br>
"Good, then it's solved."
<br><br>
And with that we pulled into the local game store to pick up a battle mat so that the great and mighty GM would have a place to draw is irregularly shaped buildings and doodle his unpleasant looking trees.  I had forgotten to bring mine, and the great one was displeased.  Besides, all of us needed to get out of the car, as the smell was getting pretty bad…
<br><br>
I am now pack leader.  But somehow it just doesn't feel right.  Do wolves elect their leaders?  I doubt it.  And did the lady warrior deserve to be omitted from whatever process we used?  Well… actually…  um…  No, all right, no.  The worst part of it all was that during that night we ran into one of our elders.  We had been lost and in unfriendly territory, so we were glad to see him.  But we also confirmed my leadership with him.  That means that I gained Honor for it.  It also means that now I am responsible for this bunch of goofs, and if we fail, I fail.  In fact, if any one of them fails, I fail.  I knew there was a reason that I don't play leaders very often.  Heck, I suspect that's why none of us play leaders all that often.
<br><br>
The countdown begins.  Soon we will all be in Norrath.  It's gonna be a hell of a lot of fun.
