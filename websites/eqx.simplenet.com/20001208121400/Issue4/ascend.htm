All right.  Let's pretend, shall we?  I've been playing EverQuest for six months or maybe a year.  I play a lot.  I only play one character.  This character has become unusually powerful.  He can actually defeat a dragon on his own.  I hear rumors that there are some very powerful demons that some wizard has gated in.  They killed him, and now heroes are dying left and right trying to send them back to the underworld.  I travel half the world to meet these creatures.  It turns out that they, while very tough, are no match for me.  I no longer feel challenged.  Or maybe I just get tired of playing the character after that much time.
<br><br>
<b>So what now?</b>
<br><br>
What other challenges are there for this character?  Maybe there are some other player characters out there that I can challenge.  Well, boredom is the worst reason to kill someone, even in a fantasy game.  Now I know that the developers at Sony will make certain that the day any character is too powerful will be a long time coming.  But it will eventually come.  Unless…

Here is the part where I tell you what I would like to see in the game.  I want to call it the ascension system, so I will.  Outlining this may be complicated, so bear with me.
<br><br>
Let us assume that there are threshold levels.  Levels where characters might find too few challenges in the world of Norrath.  I am going to suggest that there will be two levels, but there could easily be more.  Let's pretend the first is at 30th level.  At this time a character might have difficulty finding challenges.  He is powerful enough to rival the toughest monsters.  And the player might want to make a change.  As soon as the character reaches this level, the player will be given a new choice.  At the sign in screen, after choosing the character, the player would get an option button.  At this level, the option would be "mutate".
<br><br>

If the player (and I want to emphasize 'player') chooses this option he would find himself at the mutation option screen.  Here he would decide what kind of mutation he wants for the character.  The options would all be things that are unavailable to starting characters.  For example:  vampire, demon, centaur, ghost, alchemist, ninja, etc.  These would be races or classes that are somewhat more powerful than the standard types.  The player would make the choices needed to outline the mutation for his character and click OK.  Let's suppose that I chose vampire.  Then I just enter the game and play the character.  At some point I will fall victim to an assault by a few very powerful vampires and join them (or a ninja gives the character the opportunity to join them, whatever is appropriate).  It may not happen for several sessions, or even several weeks, leaving some element of surprise for the player.  Then the character would be remade as a "starting" vampire, which would certainly be weaker than he was before, but significantly more powerful than other starting characters.  And I now get to role play the experience for the character.
