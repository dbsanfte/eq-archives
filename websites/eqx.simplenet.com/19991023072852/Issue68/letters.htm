The Interview with Death was easily the most hilarious thing I have read
in EQX. It had me nearly crying from laughing so hard. Keep up the good
work.

Greetings EQX!
 <br><br>
Another extraordinary issue. 
 <br><br>
Amongst the creative and wonderful articles and stories, one seemed to touch a fiber within me. I'm speaking of Nepenthia's "Where Real Life and Fantasy Meet and Cross".
 <br><br>
She expressed the same ideas and thoughts I have had with online "worlds". I couldn't help but think, as I read this amazingly well-written piece, that she hit the nail on the head. *smiles* Well don, Nepenthia.
 <br><br>
I would also like to mention, in reference to Absor's editorial, that I feel that Verant has been doing an incredible job handling everything. They have been on top of every major problem that has come up with a tireless enthusiasm. Any Guides that I have had the experience to meet or hear about have been a great help. Constructive criticism can be good, but so can some postive words. Do you work harder for those who are complaining at you constantly or those who are encouraging,and addressing your mistakes in an intelligent and civil manner? As an after thought, the few times that EQ has been down has given me some time to read up on the great tales and songs about Norrath, here and on many other great sites. Also, I know that when EQ goes down they are updating or improving it in some way, which sounds good to me.
 <br><br>
Keep up the great work, EQX! <br>
Hope to see everyone in our adventures in this incredible world of Norrath.
