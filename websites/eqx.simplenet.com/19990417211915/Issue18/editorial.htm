<font size="+1">
<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 18!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
First and foremost:  Nice new site, Sony.  I like it.  And all the new information
and screen shots are wonderful as well.  You have again succeeded in grabbing our
interest and giving us more to consider while we wait for EverQuest.
<br><br>
As I sit and write this, I am watching the editors cut of BladeRunner.  And as Roy
destroys his maker, I think of EverQuest.  Why?  Because I’m supposed to be writing
an editorial, that’s why.  But also because we, as the players in EverQuest, have the
opportunity to destroy the game.
<br><br>
Despite the continuing sales of Ultima Online, there are many that say it is dead.
That its children have destroyed it, taken all its beauty and its joy.  Perhaps they
are right.  But certainly there have been more complaints about that one game than
any other that I am aware of.  It is my opinion that the game designers are
ultimately responsible for her death.  They made some poor choices, for reasons that
may or may not justify them.
<br><br>
But the players are not without fault here.  They have allowed themselves to be the
unwitting tools in the destruction of something that they enjoyed.  I can lay no
blame with them, however.  They simply acted as they chose.  Nobody in authority was
there to teach them.  Nobody explained the idea to them.
<br><br>
Now Roy is hunting Deckard through the abandoned apartment complex.  Roy taunts his
prey.  He wants to make certain that Deckard is suffering.  He wants to know that
someone else is feeling his pain.  Pain brought on by those that made him.  Those
that decided he would only live four years.  And all Deckard can do is try to
survive.
<br><br>
Now that’s a scene that I would love to see in EverQuest.  A battle, not only of
strength, but of morality and willpower.  Roy is resigned to his death.  Deckard
refuses his.  "Quite and experience to live in fear."  With that line, Roy gets the
chance to explain why he is putting Deckard through all of this pain.  And then, in
the end, he does the human thing, and lets him live.  He allows his story to affect
a life, without having to destroy it.
<br><br>
To bring a tale to life, that’s role playing.  Certainly the genre requires
conflict.  Every good tale requires conflict.  But it does not require killing.
<br><br>
If pitting your fighting skills against another is what you want, there are many
games out there designed for that.  Play them.  I do.  But when in a role playing
game, try the role playing idea.  You may actually enjoy it.
<br><br>
Hey, Slingblade is on!  I wonder...  :)
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
