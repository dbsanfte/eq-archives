Body shortages have caused the Necromancers Guild to plead with the public
to turn to the person nearest them and slay them.  This gesture would be
sure to provide them plenty of materials in order to continue their craft
for a number years.
<br><br>
"One corpse each, that's all we ask," says Mikron Altonna, guild
spokes-lich, "Once we've got a proper number of bodies up and animated we'll
be able to go out and make our own 'raw materials'."

Rumors of the discovery of some of the artifacts from Miragul's tomb are unfounded, say representatives of the wizards guild.
<br><br>
"We have heard nothing of a crown or a knife with Miragul's ancient symbol on them.  We have not seen them.  In fact, two or our greatest scholars, Jindar and Mistag have recently published a well received paper that proves that Miragul is indeed just a myth."
<br><br>
A quote from that paper:
<br><br>
<em>...and it has been such a long time without the discovery of ANY evidence of his existence, beyond the writings of Erud scholars.  Surely if such a man ever existed, and if there was a treasure trove of his magical items, someone would have found them by now.  It seems obvious enough with just this one fact that he never could have existed in the first place...</em>
<br><br>
Of course if the mages <em>did</em> have such relics in their possession, and perhaps the location of the ruins from where they were recovered, many bards theorize that this would be exactly the kind of thing that they would be expected to say...
