As can be expected from last week's editorial, I went on to play on a Race War server this week.  I was lucky enough to be able to get in right away when Verant brought them up earlier than expected, and so got in with the first rush.
<br><br>
And what a rush it was! I created a wood elf rogue to play and was in the chaos that was Greater Faydark with 200 newbies and 3 black wolves.  I chose this race/class combination because I had seen in the chat room how players were mostly planning on being dark elf enchanters, and I didn't want to do that.  I debated playing a gnome wizard, but decided not too, since I knew that spell casters would be common, and I have a bit of a stubborn streak.
<br><br>
After doing the guild quest, I realized that kills were just not going to happen for me - I have a slow processor, and the zone was just too full to find a kill at all.  I decided then to quest for levels and fun, and had a blast!  I also wound up avoiding the many zone crashes suffered by those in the Greater Faydark, though I'd be lying if I said that I'd planned it.
<br><br>
SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON"T WANT A QUEST SPOILER.  I decided to do the mail quest from Felwithe, Butcherblock, and Kaladim to get experience and cash.  It was easy slipping into Felwithe and a tad more scary sliding into Butcherblock to run to the docks, but I had two letters on me when I tried to sneak into Kaladim.
<br><br>
How did I sneak into Kaladim? Well, by practicing Sneak I already had it to 10 by the time I hit the docks, and wood elves naturally can hide as a racial advantage.  Since they enhanced Sneak to allow you to move invisible with a successful Sneak and Hide, I was sneaking straight past dwarves engaged in slaying skeletons and goblin whelps- I could have picked their pockets if I was higher level.  I taunted them with says and emotes, then slipped into Kaladim - and my first death.
<br><br>
While invisibility and camouflage does not disappear when you cross a zone line, Hide and Sneak both do.  I zoned into a Kaladim and raced to the wood elf bard in town, and ran straight into a dwarf who chased me all over Kaladim.  I zoned and he was there waiting for me, and I was not able to get a successful Hide in before dying.
<br><br>
That night I did the Kaladim run four times and made it twice.  Once a cleric saw me duck into the guard towers inside Kaladim before I was successful with Hide, and he targeted me with Smite and then got me outside of Kaladim.  Twice however, I completed the quest (with the three letters) and I made 2nd level having fun while the other new players argued and fought over spawns.
<br><br>
I'm going to invade Steamfont next, and steal into Ak'anon for the quest there!  Hey Verant!  Make it so I can zone and stay hidden!
