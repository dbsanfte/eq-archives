<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if you knew who the oldest bard in Norrath was?  I heard you have been around for awhile (early beta) and have played a bard the whole time.  Who was the first Norrathian bard?  I'm really curious. 
<br>
Gallorn
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah Gallorn, if you were here I would hug you to bits for allowing me to shine just a little in the bard spotlight.  *Stops a moment here to oil her creaky bones and sits back in her highbacked rocking chair with a lute carved across the top.*  The way I have it figured, if I'm right , which is still not confirmed, is that Gellor was the original player bard in Everquest back in beta .5 followed by Khelbin and then by me at the beginning of beta 1.  Gellor and Khelbin have since passed into that great music room in the sky, leaving me as the oldest continuously playing bard.  (Oh bad pun!)  Geez you'd think I'd get a medal or something wouldn't you?  There were a couple of early company bards, GZ (Geoffrey Zatkin), The Arch Mage, had one I'm quite sure and Keloni was RP's (Ryan Palacio) bard.  I'm not sure of the other early bards except I remember Azaelia, Canaais and Syrah starting within a short time after Nep appeared on the scene.  Grin, those were the old days before there was even a song to be purchased and studied, much less sung, but it wasn't too long before we all had our first songs and our first instruments and the bardic life on Norrath was in full swing.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there! I'm new to this, and I'm hoping you'll help me! Before I bought the game, I read the Q&A section of this newsletter as often as I could (great job!!) and I don't know if you covered this or not.. Is there magical equipment that speeds up attacks, like a hasten spell or something like that? Any help would be...helpful?! Thanks much! ~ 
<br>
Arudrual (Bard)
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for reading Q&A.  I'm glad you have enjoyed EQ Express.  I think if you start asking around in the game, you'll find there are basically three main ways to gain a "haste" advantage.  There is definitely equipment in the game that will give you haste, but I have been told that you need to be in about the mid-level forties to obtain it.  Some of the casters also have spell buffs for haste.  My understanding is that at high levels, the magical buffs are truly amazing.  Finally, my dear fellow bard, if you listen carefully to practice sessions of your bard guild colleagues,  you will detect the notes of a song which will give a haste effect to all party members.  Smile, now aren't you glad you're a bard?  I am!
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a druid and was wonder does higher wisdom reduce my chance of a spell being resisted or fizzling or does it just give you more mana?  Thanks 
<br>
Aluen
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the Pillars of Wisdom when you most need them?  Especially a druid one?  Well, ok I'm going to take a guess at this one based on what a couple of friends told me and hope I don't lead you astray.  Wisdom is primarily for mana.  Some say that it does help against fizzles but I haven't heard anyone say that it will help with resists.  One friend who has played a druid did say he believed that raising your channeling and specialization skills would help with more successful casting and with fewer resists.  Hope this helps.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear EQX,  I am in need of some sage advise.  Recently, I made the long haul from Grobb to North Ro.  As soon as I got there I began looking for a bind, as I didn't want to die and then have to make the trek butt naked.  A conniving dark elf gave me a bind at the entrance of the tunnel from North Ro to East Commonlands.  Well, I proceeded to get clobbered by a Madman and two scarabs.  After I re-spawned, I found that I was back in Grobb.  Well let's just say I never was able to retrieve my corpse in time and lost lots of goodies (including a chain mail shirt and a well balanced two handed sword...).  Please tell me how a bind works and how to successfully bind to a new area so that this doesn't happen again.  I hate being naked and defenseless.  By the way I play on the Prexus server, if that makes a difference. 
<br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bind can be a very tricky affair, especially for those who cannot cast it on themselves.  Here is a little basic information for you that applies to all servers.  Some classes can bind only themselves, especially at lower levels; some classes get a bind spell fairly early that can be used for others.  If you play a class that cannot bind, you'll need to have the spell cast on you by a player able to cast bind on anyone.  Note, you will need to group with the caster for the spell to work.  However, unlike the bind spell casters can use on themselves which will take effect anyplace, the spell that is cast on others (primarily on the melee classes and some of the mixed ones, like bards),  will only work in city zones.  In some instances, like Greater Faydark, the entire zone is bindable (I think as an extension of Kelethin), but this zone is a rare exception.  If, then, you were playing a melee class when the dark elf tried to bind you at the tunnel in East Commons, the bind simply would not have taken effect.  So, how can you tell if the bind works?  Well, first you should get a clear message from the spell saying that you have been bound to the area.  Second, if you don't get that message, even if the spell was cast, you are not bound and when you die you will return to your old bind point.   The caster will probably get a message if the spell fails, but may not think, or in the case of certain conniving dark elves, may not choose to tell you.  It is possible sometimes for bind to get bugged, but it's rare.  If you definitely do receive the "you feel yourself bind to the area" message and then die and return to your old bind point, you should petition and ask for help.   I've heard it is sometimes necessary for guides and gm's to clear up a bind bug, so don't hesitate to ask them to help you make sure it's right.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, fair Nepenthia.  First, may I say, I have only recently been born into the world of Norrath, and so only recently discovered this fine periodical.  However, I have gone back and read the Q&A's from all the available back issues, so far, and plan to begin reading other back issue articles now, as well.  All of the Q&A columnists have been extremely helpful and knowledgeable, though I must say, Nepenthia, you have a distinct style and grace.  [smile]  On a personal note, I know a certain wide-eyed young half-elf bard named Valentyne who is a huge fan of yours, and would love to meet you one day.  Now, on to why I am writing.  As I have so often seen others write, this is not a question, but an answer.  In issue 82 the question came up of how one can remind oneself of their chosen god, after one has begun play.  Although one back issue Q&A column is missing (#85, I believe) I have not seen an answer posted to this question.  Unless this is something new that has come up recently (I've only been around a couple of weeks) the answer is quite simple.  It is on your persona screen, right up by your name, level, class, etc.  It's small, and easy to overlook, but it's there.  Hope this helps, and I hope I'm not repeating something that was answered in the mysteriously missing issue 85.  I look eagerly forward to reading (and perhaps writing) more of your fine publication.  May Karana's rains cleanse and nurture you.

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for pointing out the persona screen inclusion of the name of the god you chose to follow when you created your character.  Interestingly, for all of beta and much of release (until a month or two ago), it was not possible to check on the god if you had forgotten your choice.  However, after religious faction started becoming a noticeable issue, particularly in quests, Verant did add the "god line" to the persona screen in a weekly patch.  Thanks for the compliments too!   Should young Valentyne find himself wandering the world on the Veeshan server, please tell him to say hi.  I'd love to meet him.  As for writing for EQ Express, I hope you do.  Our editors are always looking for new stories and articles and would love to take a look at anything you'd like to offer.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it dat me neber see no gud Shadderknight weapons about?  Me can actually count da amount of weapons dat are Shadderknight only, and me can only count to lik 3 or 4. Does tha Gods of EQ not like us SKs?  If so, why? Dey tink we ant-I-so-shull?  Me not getting gud vibes from Verant, me tink dey not like SK class too much, which make me sad =( 
<br>
Dargar
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm, are shadow knights even able to feel good vibes?  I'd be curious to see what would make such a sensation possible to this very evil class.  Strange questions aside, however, I did do some checking on the weapons that are for shadowknights only.  What I was told was a little vague so I'm hoping you won't be disappointed but it seems that there are at least two decent sk weapons in the game now and perhaps another couple that have yet to be discovered.   However, even if this seems a paucity of weapons, remember that shadow knights can use most warrior weapons including some very good ones.  As for the Gods of EQ not liking shadowknights, a very small bard like me wouldn't even dare to guess what they think.  However, given that very quiet rumors occasionally float around that troll shadowknights are favored among developers (it IS only a rumor mind you), I would guess that even though not a lot of attention is paid to shadowknights in all the "class talk" online, it isn't because Verant doesn't like them but possibly is because playing a shadow knight is hard, and so far, very few have been willing to give this difficult class a try.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you take screenshots in-game? 
<br>
Daldil
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Screenshots are easy to take in game.  At the top right hand corner of the number pad is the "-" key (above the plus key).  Click that key and you will get a message in your chat box that you have taken a screenshot.  Usually, players will take a screenshot in windowed mode to show the chat box text or inventory, etc.  For a really beautiful image, you might want to use F10 to cycle through to the full screen with no icons or words on it.  After you have taken the screenshot, you can access it as a number .bmp file from your Everquest folder.  Remember to that in addition to screenshots, you can use /log to keep track of the flow of conversation and the spam of battles in your chat box.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times have I sat against a lone tree in the Karanas, or perhaps leaning against a sand embedded rock outcropping in the vast desert of the famed Oasis.  Peacefully playing my lute, enjoying a quaint little tune.  Only to be interrupted by the barking roar of some passers-by arguing over the need to loot the valuables from and bury the cadavers created by the keen edge of their blades.  Many a time the reasoning I have overheard was that the stench of these decomposing corpses is more than enough to discourage further foul beast and evil critters from venturing to such plague infested an areas.  I myself have pondered long and hard, seeking even to play a hearty sonnet to Mithaniel Marr herself in search of an answer.  Yet even to this day, I hear often the challenge of both sides of this troubling question.  I know not the answer.  It is to this end, that I seek the knowledge of an even more learned and ancient half-elven bard to find the truth of the matter.  Tell me, doth a corpse unlooted, delay the return of more such beasts? 
<br>
Rissa Rhyminstrel
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was distressing to come to the end of  your letter so soon because I enjoyed the your detailed images very much.  Your curiosity on the matter is understandable as I too have heard much discussion as to whether it's better to clear away the carrion or leave it laying about for tactical reasons.  However, from all that I know, it makes no difference whether the foul corpses are removed or left to rot gradually into the ground.  The beasts choose where and when they will come, caring not what remains of their kind from previous battles.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you please enlighten me and perhaps a lot of others on what the spell "Thicken Mana" is.  I know it summons viscous mana but I can find no info on its use.  Thanks. 
<br>
Rhaven
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Casandra, the enchanter Pillar of Wisdom, here is a bit more information for you on the "Thicken Mana" spell.  The spell itself will create a vial of viscous mana as you indicated and the vial then is used for making enchanted armor.  Silk armor may possibly be made this using the vial, but you'll have to investigate that to make sure.
<br><br>


<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question I believe the name of the other person who hunts poachers in the hills is Cros Treewind.  He's a high level druid. 
<br>
Tularan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks very much for writing about Cros Treewind.  I thought I didn't like him at one point because we had a little tete a tete where I seemed to be the cast in the role of villain despite my rational argument that the wolf had attacked me first.  However, Cros did finally forgive me for that small blunder after I managed to run away from his temper and let him cool down.   Later, however, one night when I was sure death was only moments away, he wandered over the hill and slew the nasty gnoll who was trying to sink his fangs into my strumming arm.  It was a close call and I was grateful Cros was willing to put his life on the line for me against the blue furred fury attacking me.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ta-Da, it's your 100th issue, that's 100 weeks, ALMOST two entire years of EQX :)  Congrats on it!  Hope this issue will be the best one yet! Here's my opinion for the cleric.... I myself have a high elf cleric, level 9 (Temolan, Veeshan), and I think he is certainly well rounded, except for strength, and we high elven males look nice in bronze and leather :)  Anyway, here is my opinion... if you want to be a Dark Elf, be prepared to be encumbered usually.  If you wanna be a Dwarf, you will not get interrupted quite so easily.  You also have the highest STA for a cleric.  If you wanna be an Erudite.... don't.  Dwarves, for one, have more in EACH stat (or the same) as an erudite, except INT (does not affect a clerics mana, contrary to what people wrote in last issue), and CHA, but who cares about charisma, unless you're like "I must have high CHA to sell items!"  If you wanna be a gnome, again, don't.  Way too low wisdom (only 77 base), but decent AGI and DEX.  The agi and dex, however, do not make up for wisdom.  Halfling, you have THE highest agi and tied for the highest for dex (with dwarf), and your wisdom is decent (90).  If you wanna be a high elf, good for you.  What we lack in all the other stats, we make up for in wisdom.  And humans, they are well rounded.  Highest strength for a cleric, decent sta, kinda low dex and agi, medium wis, int and cha are kinda low, but who cares about them?  All in all, your choice comes down to four races, in my opinion.  These are listed in the order that *I* think are the best.  High Elf (extreme mana), Halfling (good tanker), Dwarf (nice strength, good for tanking), Human (well-rounded), and Dark Elf (decent wis, decent sta).  Now my Cleric, mind you, is a high elf.  He is really really good at tanking (he has a FS Morning Star).  Again I will say this, do NOT be an Erudite or a Gnome cleric.  Leave them to be casters, cause they both have high base INT.  Those were just my opinions, and comparisons on Clerics.-

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Aalon, for writing in again.  It was a pleasure meeting you on Veeshan.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings.  As a ranger, I make it my duty to know the locations of places near by my haunts.  As an answer to a reply written in issue 98, The Ranger's Glade is an enigmatic place, hidden by magic, but somehow easily found.  (And NO, there are no spoilers, except for those posted by players in the forums)  To enter, you must find the proper route.  (www.soerbaird.com/ranger)  Good luck, and see ye there!

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for writing.  I'm sure those who missed the replies in the last issue of EQ Express will be glad to get the address for The Ranger's Glade.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really a question, but a correction. In the last issue (99) there was a statement saying that monks get magical punches at level 12. This is not true. 
<br>
Inquis
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  I confess to being slightly confused on this as HBK in the past issue stated that with tiger claw monks could kill wisps at level 12, and I'm assuming tiger claw is a form of magical punch?  If someone could clarify this, then perhaps we can let the monks kick and punch in peace.  Err battle?
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In issue 98 you had a question concerning "hotkeying a message".  You mentioned that it appeared there was a lot of space for a long message but there isn't really. *** There are 5 lines in the edit box when you edit a socials.  Each line can accept a command.  Clicking the button can then send 5 commands in a row!  This is very handy when doing language spamming for instance as you will transmit 5 '/gsay's from one click!  You can also extend a message for auctions by just repeating the /auction and continuing your test.  I personally use it for special emotes and sayings that will pop up ALL TOGETHER on the screen thereby making them seem more 'realistic'.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the question, in issue 99, regarding how players "macro" very long auctions.  The trick is to hit shift-up arrow to scroll back through your previous messages.
<br>
Aarken Treantheart - Shadowhunter - E'ci Server
</I><BR>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have figured out how players are using multiple lines in auctions without having the text command at the beginning of every sentence.  Just fill the custom box with text and switch your chat to auction.  Thanks for the info,
<br><br>
Mysteria Stormwind
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you all for writing.  It looks like you have each come up with a solution on using the hotkeys to get longer macros.  I still would love it though if I could place a four line stanza of a ballad on one hotkey macro without /say starting each line.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear bard if you have yet to meet a Dark Elf you would care to spend the evening with that is because you have not met myself. Best Regards
<br>
Sadil D'Nokta
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's true I have not met you.  Since it is simply not fair to judge an individual by the reputation of his kind, I  would welcome the opportunity to spend the evening with you as long as you aren't the type of Dark Elf who is insufferably longwinded about his superiority.  Should you want to meet me, find me on Veeshan and I shall try my best not to be an insufferably verbose bard and will attempt to meet charm with charm.  Thank you for writing.




<br><br><br>
Thanks to all of you for writing in.  This is our hundredth issue and I'm so pleased to now be a part of the folks who bring you EQ Express.  A hundred weeks ago I didn't even have the slightest idea that this journal existed and that in a few short months I'd be clicking into the newspaper every week, checking L'il Archie, reading stories, enjoying poems and articles, and eventually becoming a contributor too.  I'm so glad an old mage long ago told me that I must take a look at this wonderful site.
