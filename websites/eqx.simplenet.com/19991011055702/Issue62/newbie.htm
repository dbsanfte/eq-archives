It's here! It's here! It finally came!<br>
Phase 4 is in my grasp!<br>
Another week and I'd have gone insane,<br>
I get to play at last!
<br><br>
I slash at the mail, the paper rips away,<br>
As if 'twas touched by Death.<br>
I jam the game in my CD tray,<br>
And then I take a breath!
<br><br>
The sounds blast and the pictures glow,<br>
I've been waiting for this so long!<br>
Even with my new graphics card,<br>
I'd been getting bored of Pong.
<br><br>
Into the night I gaze at the screen,<br>
As I play and play EQ.<br>
Into my veins I inject caffiene,<br>
Every half-hour or two.
<br><br>
Although I'm just a newbie,<br>
I will still boldly go,<br>
And thrust my lethal dagger<br>
Into the heart of every foe!
<br><br>
I admit I've never played the game,<br>
But I'll learn as I go.<br>
If foes were wise, they'd run away,<br>
I've practiced in UO.
<br><br>
Into the wild I'll bravely tred,<br>
With my knife and some food.<br>
Off the land I'll learn to live.<br>
I will be a kewl dood.
<br><br>
I can't be killed, I'll never die!<br>
I'll show them who is boss!<br>
And if I fail, I'll start to cry,<br>
And turn my PK switch off.
<br><br>
I choose a path and start to walk<br>
To start a daring day.<br>
As I go, I shout gangsta talk,<br>
So others can't role-play.
<br><br>
As I travel throughout the land,<br>
What'd you suppose I see?<br>
I come across and Ogre band,<br>
They start to laugh at me.
<br><br>
Shut up, you punks! I yell at them,<br>
They tremble in their fear,<br>
But they wield swords and start to grin,<br>
As soon as I get near.
<br><br>
I have no sword, but I can bite,<br>
And kick them in the shin.<br>
I'll sure as heck put up a fight,<br>
I'm certain I will win.
<br><br>
Despite my brilliant fighting skills,<br>
I fail to stay erect.<br>
Fatalities don't work on them&hellip;<br>
Must be a game defect.
<br><br>
I fight and fight to stay alive,<br>
They club me in the head.<br>
I won't give up, I must survive,<br>
Dang! It looks like I'm dead!
<br><br>
They killed me once, but I don't care,<br>
It doesn't cause me strife.<br>
I'll get them back, I won't play fair,<br>
When I come back to life.
<br><br>
My newbie friends gather 'round,<br>
And we get set to kill.<br>
We'll pound those Ogres to the ground,<br>
To prove that we have skill.
<br><br>
We hunt and search to find those tramps<br>
Who killed my yesterday.<br>
But when we come across their camp,<br>
My friends all run away.
<br><br>
Well look who's back,&rdquo; they say to me,<br>
Ya want to play some more?<br>
Before I can turn 'round to flee,<br>
They pound me to the floor.
<br><br>
I'm dead again, that wasn't nice,<br>
For them to fight like that.<br>
I should have taken some advice,<br>
And practiced on a bat.
<br><br>
Once more I'll try, with newbie friends,<br>
To kill those Ogre fools.<br>
My two past deaths must be avenged,<br>
Or how can I be kewl?
<br><br>
Before too long we see our foes,<br>
Near the horizon line.<br>
Anxiety for battle grows,<br>
A chill runs down my spine.
<br><br>
I have some leather armor now,<br>
So I am not afraid.<br>
Their Orge heads will surely bow<br>
Beneath my mighty blade.
<br><br>
Who cares that they were in Phase 3,<br>
I'm much too kewl to lose.<br>
My newbie friends will protect me,<br>
Cause we are awesome doods.
<br><br>
As they approach, I start to cuss.<br>
This doesn't look like fun.<br>
The problem is that they've got us<br>
Outnumbered 3 to 1.
<br><br>
Now wait, I say, on second thought<br>
I'm not so sure I'll win.<br>
In truth I think I'd rather not<br>
Get slaughtered once again.
<br><br>
The enemy's upon us now,<br>
And I don't feel so brave.<br>
My friends and I shout &ldquo;Holy cow!&rdquo;<br>
And run into a cave.
<br><br>
So in the shadows we will hide,<br>
Until the threat is gone.<br>
Deep into the night, we all cried<br>
And shouted for our moms.
