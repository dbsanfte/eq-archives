"Help!" shouted Mikhak the Dwarf, breaking the silence accross the zone.  
<br><br>
"I have fallen in the Estate of Unrest by the evil within and have had no luck retrieving my corpse."  His pleas fell on deaf ears.  
<br><br>
Then with a sharp crack in the sky and a blinding light Loviane the Bard of the Order of Norrath appeared.  
<br><br>
Dubar stirred in her presence, for he had always held a fondness for this one.  She is of a kinder, gentler spirit with a deep sense of compassion that is so rare in this harsh land.  The Half-Elven Bard came forth to investigate this plea to see if in fact there were a foul play at hand.  But the dwarf had fallen by the evil of this darkened hellhole and not by some mistake of the gods.
<br><br>
"Alas Mikhak, my hands are bound.  I cannot help thee lest I anger the gods myself," said Loviane.  "You may require the help of your fellow adventurers but there is nothing I can do to help."  
<br><br>
With that she made her exit. As gracefully as she had appeared she was gone.
<br><br>
Having overheard this conversation from nearby, Dubar looked to his party... their faces showed a silent sorrow as each one pondered Mikhak's situation and mirrored it into their own... Rynna Ketilson, Yiin the Wizard, Dubar's brother Linc, Hope Healfinger, and Megadyen the Paladin.  
<br><br>
Each knowing the horrors that lie within these forsaken walls, they sat quietly until one spoke up.  It was Yiin who first said "maybe we should try to help him." A noble gesture but all of us knew we had not the stamina to charge foolishly into the perils that lie within that mansion of the unholy.  Adding ours to the corpse that lie within would serve no purpose... but Mikhak was a loner and had no party of his own.
<br><br>
Dubar thought, "If only there were a way to pull together all who hailed here in this foul place we may stand a chance after all." but how...
<br><br>
Upon that thought, Dubar stood up, cupped his hands to the sides of his mouth, and shouted for all to hear: "How many of you here would like to lose your corpse?"
<br><br>
...A long uncomfortable silence fell over the zone.
<br><br>
"Then we must band together and do this for Mikhak" 
<br><br>
Dubar's companions looked on, a new feeling swept the group... not one of sorrow but of Honor, and Chivalry.  They began to prepare for the battle that was to take place here.  The other groups complied with this plan and included some of the finest warriors and wizards in all of Norrath... 
<br><br>
With them stood Mavrik the Gnome, Celestak the Half-Elf, Ainadyen the Wizard, Curzad the Dwarf of the Angels of Norrath and several of his guild.  But one stood out in particular.  A champion named Saava Devilare, Clad in full plate and wielding a Claymore.
<br><br>
And so it was ordained, these nobles would take on the evil of this Estate, amidst the foul stench that permeated the air, as one Legion.
<br><br>
As the parties gathered near the rear stoop of the Estate, the groans of the undead filled the air and mingled with the clanking of steel and armor as the restless army prepared for battle.  The sounds of spells and the glowing of magic fired off as the clerics prepared their warriors with the blessings of holiness and spiritual aids they would need to withstand this fight.  As the night drew upon them, another silence fell as the clerics meditated for their last time to prepare for the final showdown.
<br><br>
Saava and Megadyen went into the house first, their plan to bait the lesser ghouls and skeletons to the trap which lie just outside the back door of the Estate.  Linc and Dubar moved to the sentry position to see that they were not caught off guard.  
<br><br>
It worked!  With a blast and a shriek they came barreling down the hallway with several undead in tow through the back door.  As Saava plowed out onto the lawn Megadyen was hit by a stunning blow that sent him for a loop, reeling in pain.  Linc and Dubar jumped to his aid, taunting and warding the foul creatures to draw their fire as Yiin and Ainadyen and the Clerics blasted them down with powerful magics.  Curzad's crew jumped in quickly to dispatch the remainder of the ghouls attacking the mages.  The first stage of the assault was a great success and boosted the moral of all.  
<br><br>
If only they had known what lie in store for them...
<br><br>
Rynna and Hope settled in to meditate while the fighters prepared for the next assault. The one they hoped would lead them to the corpse of the fallen Mikhak.  The clerics stood and healed the Paladins, the graceful wave of their arms and the pale blue light emanating from their fingertips a glorious site to behold as they delivered their life-giving gift.  
<br><br>
Once again Saava and Megadyen entered the house first.  This time Dubar went in with them to offer a third pair of eyes to aid the search.  The remainder of the parties waited outside with Linc as their captain, awaiting further orders from within.  As the three entered the hallway leading to the stairs the groans of the unholy seemed deafening. The stairs creaked uneasily under the weight of the armored Knights as they cautiously approached the second floor landing... still no sign of Mikhak's corpse.
<br><br>
Saava peered up the next flight of stairs, a lump forming in his throat as he imagined the evil that dwelled on this level.  Champion or not, lore has it that a bewitching hag resides here that can charm any living creature and conform him at will to do her bidding.  The thought of Saava's Calymore turned to do evil's bidding put a lump in Dubar's throat.  
<br><br>
As they approached the top floor, Dubar could see Mikhak's corpse.  It lie in a twisted heap at the top of the third landing.  Just to the right of it was a room, the door slightly ajar, and Dubar could see from within a tall skeleton and two large ghouls.  His bravery was tried as he stood soldier in the doorway and called for Mikhak to come to the front and begin his recovery.  With Saava to his back, and Linc and the Angels just outside, Dubar peered into the room biting back on his fear, ready to distract the foul creatures should they try to interfere with Mikhak.  He knew it was only a matter of time before they sensed him, for the undead could smell a Paladin from a mile away.
<br><br>
The time ticked by, seconds seemed like hours and the only sounds were that of the tormented dead and his own heartbeat pounding heavily in his chest... then he realized it... he was staring into the face of the hag herself!  
<br><br>
Almost as though his thoughts betrayed his presence to her, the hag snapped to and stared straight into Dubar's eyes.  Ice filled his veins as he readied his own Claymore, poised to strike.  Mikhak had completed his recovery and readied his weapon; he would stand and fight with these brave souls who had helped him to retrieve his belongings.  
<br><br>
The hag shrieked and began casting as the two carrion ghouls rushed out of the room... "Thud" was the sound as Dubar was hit by the first, then again by the second... stunned for a moment he yelled to his companions "THIS IS IT!  IT'S GOING DOWN HERE, NOW!"  Saava turned and immediately jumped into the melee. Linc, sensing his brother's urgent need, shouted to the troops outside "FOLLOW ME NOW" and rushed into the house.  Their battle cries could be heard clear across Faydwer.  As he rushed to his brother's aid along with Celestak, Megadyen, and the fearless Dwarves led by Curzad, the clash of steel shattered the silence of the night and the fight was on.  
<br><br>
To the stairs came Rynna and Hope, they began casting their healing magic onto those who were most in need while Yiin, Mavrik, and Ainadyen blasted away with the magics reserved only for the most dedicated of mages... fire flew from their fingertips in a glorious rage!  The level of chaos rose to new heights as several more skeletons joined the fight, Monks and Ice Bones led by a Barbed Skeleton the likes of which could humble the holiest of Paladins.  Their own battle cries ringing out; "Paladins like you have no place in our Realm" followed by the blood curdling laughter of the tortured dead. Bones crunched and brimstone flew as the melee turned into a frenzy of flying steel and explosions.  
<br><br>
But the fight was not going well... the close quarters of the hallway made for a disadvantage and the order was given to retreat.  This proved to be the turning point of the battle... for the worst.
<br><br>
The hallway flushed out... the formation of the group turned tragic during the retreat as the Mages and Clerics were now at the front-line and the first floor was replenished with fresh ghouls and skeletons.  Meanwhile the flank was now heavy with the purest of evil.  The party took a beating and the halls of the undead were covered with fresh blood while they made their way back into the graveyard.  
<br><br>
Out onto the lawn with a fury unseen until now the battle continued.  All hell hath broken loose and Nosferatu's Legions came down like a flaming fist.  Saava now in a berserker rage. Megadyen flailing wild with two swords. Curzad and his Angels bashing and slashing away. Linc and Dubar side by side, brothers to the bitter end, Celestak, Mikhak... warriors all true and brave, trying desperately to relieve the clerics from the relentless attacks of the foul unearthed but all fighting a losing battle.  
<br><br>
Rynna, the finest Cleric ever to grace this party is feverishly trying to heal her friends, hollow, knowing she has run out of mana and is in poor health herself, they are outnumbered 2 to 1.  Hope Healfinger has fired the last of her spells and has turned to fighting in weapon melee... all around the sounds of clashing steel and the howls of battle!  
<br><br>
Then it happened...
<br><br>
A fatal blow is delivered. With the heart-wrenching sound of bones crunching and the last dying gasp of a comrade in arms, Dubar turns in the heat of combat to see Ainadyen fall at his feet... lifeless in a pool of blood.  Rage and tears both fill his eyes, tearing him between his hatred for the undead and his compassion and respect for his comrades.  As he looks toward Rynna he can see she has abandoned hope, her health is failing fast despite all he has done to distract the carrion ghoul.  But she is as brave a warrior as any on the battlefield and she will not flee until the command is given, always putting the lives of her comrades ahead of her own.  
<br><br>
With one final, crushing blow from the carrion ghoul, Rynna's life is taken... as she falls to the blood-soaked field, her dying gasp is like a dagger that rips through Dubar's heart... for she is not only his faithful companion but his brother Linc's soulmate and love.  With her death comes the harsh realization that they must now flee for safety, those that remain, so that they may one-day return to avenge the deaths of their fallen brethren.  Linc leads the retreat with a warning cry, "RUN NOW OR DIE FIGHTING!!!" as he swings his mighty Combine one last time and beheads the Skeletal Monk with one fell swoop.
<br><br>
The trip out to safety will not be an easy one however, it is a long way to the edge of the zone and the undead are now bloodlusted and bent on destruction.  Mikhak is overrun in the path between the hedgerows; his last look is one of admiration of the bravery that took place in his honor here this day... He fought bravely with his saviors right to the end.  Not ten feet from Mikhak, Curzad is felled...  honorable and noble... he will go into the history books.
<br><br>
Dubar is the first to make the entrance to the zone.  With his party close at his heels he turns to offer assistance to his brother Linc, whose health has now fallen to a dangerous low.  His own health is no better but he will lay it down if it would do some good.  As Linc enters the tunnel, followed by Mega and Yiin, a ghoul roots Linc with his back facing the attack.  With at least 6 more undead at his back the assault is devastating and Linc is forced to lay hands on himself in a desperate ploy to withstand the abuse until he is free to run again.  
<br><br>
As Dubar taunts the undead at Linc's back to no avail he can see Mega approach from behind, near death but still swinging his swords in a most valiant manner.  Neither Megadyen nor Dubar can deliver an effective defense for Linc and Mega falls in the effort.  
<br><br>
All at once Yiin steps up and in the most heroic deed of the battle he casts his area spell into the fray of ghouls knowing full well they will all turn on him at the delivery thus sacrificing his own life for the chance to save Linc.  Linc reminds Dubar that he can do no more good here and tells him to go on alone.  Dubar's health in such a state of emergency that he is barely able to crawl to the zone.  As he backs away he watches as Yiin fires his spell and is torn to shreds by the relentless servants of hell, followed by the gruesome dismemberment of his brother Linc.  Tears fill his eyes as he joins the remainder of the survivors in safety.  
<br><br>
As he sits with his head in his hands, the visions dancing through his mind of his fallen friends and family, Dubar ponders the question... was it all worth it?  The answer resounds through his head like the Trumpets of Antonius Bayle's Court... yes.
