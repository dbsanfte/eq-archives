Got your attention with that title?  Good.  I'd say the buzz about the beta is near a fever pitch.  We've got one newsgroup that is flooded with messages about what a group of disgruntled testers have to say about the game.  On the other group they've receded quietly into fantasy and are running their own campaign in the newsgroup-Re-establishing the tradition of storytelling that was once the mainstay of the Avault forum.everquest group.
<br><br>
So what's a poor journeyman enchanter to do (Besides gobble down the tidbits and asides which may or may not actually be bits of valid EQ Beta information).  I've decided that the only topic left is the "buzz" itself.
<br><br>
1) True or False: Hype is a good thing.
<br><br>
Either answer would be valid here.  Anyone remember the game UO (pronounced *cough*)?  It was the first real graphical multiplayer RPG to capture the attention of gamers at large.  So when it was finally released and the boxes started flying off the shelves why did there come a backlash?
<br><br>
Generally it's considered a good thing to get folks interested in a game, and the more appealing a game is the more people will want to play it and the more they will get their friends interested.  Of course what happens when the product doesn't live up to the hype is the kind of rebellion we've seen spelt across the newsgroups in all caps.
<br><br>
2) True or False: UO was a "bad" game?
<br><br>
Hard subject for me to write on, since I was warned of it's shortcomings and therefore steered away from it.   Even from what I've heard, I'm not sure it was a bad game.  It was certainly riddled with flaws.  But anything that is first out of the gate is going to have problems.  And why have some of these problems not been fixed?  Well, more often than not it points back to developers who are doing their best to alter the existing game without making serious fundamental changes in the way they designed the game.  In other words, to "refine" rather than just reverse course and admit that some things were done out and out wrong.
<br><br>
3) True or False: EQ will live up to the hype.
<br><br>
This one's easy.  False.
<br><br>
How could it?  In the shadow of it's predecessor, folks have looked to EQ to sublimate their desire to recede into fantasy.  They already have the assumption (as do I) that it is going to be better.  These are both good things, but now with their hopes once beaten down by hordes of gibbering dOOdz they've decided that this game will be the answer to their once misdirected prayers.
<br><br>
Fact is that the game market can only get better.  With all the entrants into the marketplace that are scheduled over the next couple of years there is certain to be one that is to your liking.  EQ can not live up to the hype because at the moment it is the "one true online RPG".  Made by gamers, for gamers, it is certain to be entertaining, but pushing the envelope always results in failure to hit certain expectations; if not their own, then that of the public at large.  Sony 989 studios began with Tanarus, and gave the people a smooth running game and created weather effects.  Subsequently the weather was pulled because of latency and framerate problems.  Does this mean they were wrong to give it and then take it away?  I would think not.  And primarily this is because there needs to be somebody brave enough to try things nobody else has done before, even if they must backtrack later and regroup.
<br><br>
4) So what should Ernest expect when he gets into Blackburrow?
<br><br>
I think he should expect to have a good time.  But he should also expect things to never be as perfect as he has always dreamed it to be.  The virtual world is like the real world in the sense that there will always be things unexplained, there will always be miscues, and at times it will seem like the world is out to get you.  I just hope that he learns to roll with the punches.
