This week I find myself at a bit of a loss for what to write for my editorial.   This is not national news, but I'm stuck, and you're stuck with me.  So, I'm going to inflict some of my ramblings on you, to see if you are man enough (or woman enough, or dwarf enough, or elf enough, etc) to take it.
<br><br>
I've noticed that I seem to be the leader in most of the groups I wind up in.  I must be some sort of discipline freak or something, because I wind up telling people their roles, and how to do them best, and then reminding them how to do it, and reminding them that only one player should pull.  The things I keep saying aren't really hard concepts - don't fight a mob at it's spawn point, especially if it is part of a group of mobs.  One person pulling means we don't get swarmed.  Tell us how your mana is doing.  Warriors, taunt the monsters off the casters. Use /assist. Clerics heal and buff, stop acting like a wizard. I died in one group because the group kept running down to the dervish camp to attack a single dervish.   Surprise, surprise, we wound up with 4 on us in about 2 minutes.
<br><br>
Another thing I do in groups is act as a liaison with other group at that camping spot.  I don't camp too much, but when I do, I like to be somewhere that all the groups work together to share it.  So, I trot over to one group, chat a bit, find out who is leader, go to another group, chat a bit, find out who is leader, then negotiate with both and then hang out and kill things. We should have a "camp channel".  "This one's green to us - you take it, elf group, it should challenge you guys."
<br><br>
I have been known to teach other groups at a camp how to deal with a kill-stealing character who isn't tough enough to take on the camps monsters alone, but lets each group whittle it down and then nukes it away from the group. (In case you are wondering, the secret is to be disciplined enough to all pull off the monster as soon as the stealer starts.  The monster usually races towards the stealer, and beats the stuffing out of them. Yesterday, after repeated requests to stop stealing, we let a wizard die 4 times.  It was beautiful.)
<br><br>
I'm also now the official group bully.  If a player is out of line (looting out of turn, not following orders) I give them one warning then boot them.  If the group doesn't boot them, then I leave, simple as that.  I don't need to log in and have a bad time, so I just take off.  Most groups I'm in reform around me later, after the rest of the group gets tired of the offending player.
<br><br>
What really winds up happening is that I am *talking* all the time, and not doing as much fighting.  Type, type, type.  I find that I'm not taking my share of the risk load, but doing a lot of coaching.  The only thing that redeems me in that respect is that if the group gets in trouble, I jump in and give them time to run.  Thus, I usually die more frequently.  Usually by that time the group is pretty well organized, so it doesn't happen, but…
<br><br>
There is nothing more beautiful than an organized group.  Nothing can approach the teamwork feeling of a bunch of strangers who meld together into a fighting force.  Yesterday I wound up bullying, cajoling, and ordering a group into shape, and then we had about two hours of non-stop fighting, no one died, we barely paused between monsters, and the whole group was ready to die for each other.  Seeing the bard fire up her anthem de arms and twist her songs, watching the wizard *wait* to nuke until the monster was half down, seeing the warrior <em>taunt</em> at one bubble of health, confident that the cleric would heal him (that's me) - wow.  Three of the group leveled, but they didn't even notice they were close.  They were as surprised as the rest of us.
<br><br>
I just wish I could stop typing so much when I play.
