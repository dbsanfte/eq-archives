<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be a Mac version of the game released in the near future?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No announcements have been made regarding a Mac version, nor have I heard of any development along those lines.  As is typical in the gaming industry, the Macintosh is not seen as a large market.  However, if EQ is successful enough to become a mainstream game (like Myst or Diablo) then a Mac version is not unlikely in the distant future.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any form of marriage in EQ? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Marriages have become commonplace in online multiplayer RPGs.  Most MUDs provide in-game support with items such as wedding rings and private chat lines.  EQ does not provide built in support for marriages, but the role play aspect of the game lends itself nicely to marriages.  There have already been marriages in Norrath, fully RP'd by the players hosting them.  However, due to the large number of players in EQ, the GMs and Guides will not be able to provide special attention for wedding ceremonies.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you be engaged in only one quest at a time?  If you get a quest that you don't like are you stuck with it until you complete it, or can you get another in addition? When you get another quest is your previous one nullified?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no limitation on the number of quests.  They are all distinct quests that typically have no interrelations.  Now, some quests may not be available until after others are completed, but in general you can completely any quest regardless of which others you have started.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything that can be bought or made to cover up embarrassing cleavages on many of the female characters?  I have had to endure rude behavior and ridicule over these "bathing suit" outfits. Cloth shawls are invisible as are many tunics for non-pure magic users. I wish to play a cleric, a ranger and a druid but my characters will be dressed in clothing that is just too revealing to wear for adventuring. Please HELP!
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the never ending plight of the modest EverQuest female.  All I can say is that every race looks different in the same armor, and the varying degrees of armor look different from each other on the same race.  This means that while your leather tunic may be nothing more than a bikini top, it may appear to cover much more on, say, a high elf female.  When you get chain or plate armor, the looks can change quite a bit, too.  Your leather g-string could be replaced with platemail pants that will also protect you from the prying eyes of lonely boys.  There may be no relief for some race/class combinations, however, so you should find a way to slap the wrists of those who ogle too overtly.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon release, will EverQuest server access be available only to the United States or will coverage include Canada/North America as well? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the global nature of the internet, and the huge market for online games, there will likely be no access restrictions to the server based on geographical location.  Verant is well aware that there are many potential customers in Canada, Europe, Asia and everywhere else short of Antarctica.  You can bet they will not be leaving anybody out to dry come release.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is mouselook and what is its effect on EverQuest?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouselook is a common feature in many first-person games, particularly in shooters such as the Quake series.  It allows you to turn your character or tilt the camera up and down merely by moving the mouse in the desired direction.  Mouselook is typically triggered by holding down a key on the keyboard or a button on the mouse.  In EverQuest, mouselook can be enabled or disabled in the menus.  It can be triggered by holding the right mouse button and dragging the mouse.  While in first-person view, this will let you turn right and left and look up and down.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have eight spells memorized that I want to keep memorized, but I need to cast another spell from my book.  Can I cast a spell without memorizing it, with a time delay or some other penalty, or must I memorize it, cast it, and then rememorize the original spell?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must remove a spell from memory, memorize the new spell, and then replace it again with the original spell.  Luckily, at higher levels, memorizing spells is nearly instantaneous.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the two extra continents not shown in the general map? Will they be included when EQ is released?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunark and Vellious were originally planned to be included in the game, but were left out in favor of adding more zones to the existing three continents.  The end result is more zones and a larger game than originally planned, but with the zones laid out closer to the populated areas.  Additional continents may become available through expansion packs.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to a character when you log off? Do they sleep? Do they disappear into oblivion until you log back on? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens to your toys when you fall asleep?  Do they wake up and move around and play like in Toy Story?  What happens to the refrigerator light when the door closes?  What are you supposed to answer when your girlfriend asks, "What are you thinking about?"  And why do they go to the bathroom in groups?  There are some mysteries in life that will forever remain mysteries.  All we can say for sure about our characters when we log out is that they are safe until we log in again.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know if all the quests will be working in EverQuest when it is released?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose that depends on what you mean by "all the quests."  EQ will always be a changing world, with new items, quests, monsters, and features being added all the time.  What about the current quests that do not completely work right now?  Hopefully those problems will be ironed out by release, and hopefully quests will exist in every home city.  There isn't much time left, however, so we'll have to see.  The good thing is there are tons of existing quests already to keep us busy well into release, giving Verant a small cushion for adding new ones.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is better infra or ultravision?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Infravision gives everything a reddish tint, while ultravision does not.  Ultravision should give a clearer view in dark situations.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the large races (Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians) treat many larger weapons as one-handed? It would make sense that an Ogre could easily wield a halberd with one hand, for example, due to the relative size of the weapon.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This feature exists in some MUDs, such as BatMUD, but is not the case for EQ.  It adds a great complexity for balancing, and was likely not added for this reason.  For example, a human warrior would only be able to wield one halberd while an ogre would wield two.  Adding in potential strength bonuses, this would give them over twice as much damage potential.  To compensate for this, ogres and the rest would have to have huge penalties assessed.  Balance is always a delicate, imperfect science, and any new features or powers have the potential to throw everything out of whack.  The beta process has helped fine tune the current balance, and we should not expect to see far-reaching changes like this so close to release.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of your articles it said that experience goes by the most damage done. If you're in a group, it's split. So, if two level 4's are in a group, and only one does all the damage to kill the monster, do they still split the experience points by half? If not, what if you have a cleric in your group doing more healing then fighting?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, two level four characters of the same race and class will split the experience in half.  The distribution is based upon total experience worth so far, and not necessarily the level.  So, if a human warrior has earned a total of 4000 xp, which gives him say, level 4, and a wood elf ranger has earned a total of 4000 xp, which gives him say, level 3, they would both gain equal shares of experience in the same group.  The group split is not based upon damage done, so even your healing cleric will gain experience for a kill.
