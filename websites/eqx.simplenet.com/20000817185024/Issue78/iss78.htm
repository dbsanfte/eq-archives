   The low hallway led into a tiny room.  A heavy wooden door was set deep into the stone wall, featureless save for a small panel.  Daryth rapped a complicated staccato and the panel slid open.  All that could be seen of the person on the other side was a pair of suspicious eyes.
<br><br>
   "Hail, Galern," said Daryth.  "Let us in."
<br><br>
   "Who's the bint?" Galern replied in a heavy Dwarvish accent.

Let's talk switch shall we.  No, not the once widely discussed PK switch, devised to protect players from the marauding Ultima Online huns.  I'm referring to the newly implemented RP (Role-play) switch.
<br><br>
The greatest criticism of the switch seems to be that now that it exists those who do not wish to role-play in this game (which is by definition a "role-playing game") do not have to.   Now they just don't turn on the switch and they can talk about any idiotic thing they want.  Score of the Pacers-Nicks game; What level you should be to take on a griffin; ANY SPOILER THEY FEEL LIKE SHOUTING OUT TO THE PUBLIC.

Different game, same old problems. The power gamers think role players are a bunch of idiots. The role players wish those who don't get it would get lost. The jerks continue to be jerks out to ruin everyone fun. Why is it that unlike other genres RPG's seem to attract an incredibly divergent population that co-exists at best, despise each other at worst?
<br><br>
I've been doing this online thing for quite some time now. Though the game changes, the archetypes seem to always remain the same. There is the person who wants to win the game by getting the most powerful items, the highest skills, and the most money. Then there is the person who is just on for the fun<b>...</b>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the more annoying trends that has developed over the past several years in PC gaming is the tendency for companies to release products that are, quite simply, not finished.  Generally the consensus logic behind this seems to be that problems can just be patched in the future.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it’s done by accident … a broken quest in a game, not enough QA (&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;), etc.  And sometimes it’s simply done to get a product to market, because development-level companies do have some pressure to get some revenue on the books (especially when it can take years to develop a single project).  In 20 years of PC gaming (and a stint working at a software store in college) I’ve seen both, with products running the gamut from small tweaks needed to obviously unfinished products hitting the shelves.  In fact, come to think of it, I can just barely remember the last game I bought that didn’t have at least one patch released subsequently.  I think it was pong for the Atari.</P>

One of the hardest things for me to do as a writer, and I suspect it's this way for a lot of us inexperience hacks, is to through away an hours worth of typing.  Especially if that hours worth of typing was preceded by several hours worth of thinking about what to write.  But sometimes ya just gotta do it.  And so the first version of this editorial is... well, I didn't delete it, but it'll never see daylight.  At some point, no matter how right you think you are, you just have to move on.

When I started out to write this editorial, I wanted to rant about the Role-playing switch.  I think that Absor and I both feel the same way about the switch but perhaps I'll let Absor do the rant, and I'll instead ask the question; Why are there so many people willing to slam Verant with almost abusive posts about the game or gameplay issues?  I have noticed, over time, both on the Boards and news sites and links they post there, some pretty virulent comments about the game.

Please understand, there are no dedicated areas for Role Players, thus there is no mandate that Role Players be accepted.  There is only the compromise of mutual tolerance.  Be appraised that, while the charmed and amused will /tell you how much they are enjoying your role playing banter, the annoyed and irritated generally will not, if they're sociable, well-adjusted people.  You managed to find one who is neither, apparently.  My point is, just because a lot of people don't tell you you're annoying, it does NOT follow that you aren't annoying a lot of people.
