Let me get this out of the way first.  Some of you may have read my <a href="../Issue41/edita.htm">editorial</a> in issue 41.  Well, the basic idea was that I once complained that the folks that play mages aren't too bright, and tend to blast the party with their magic too often.  Well, I guess I ain't to bright either.  My brand new character, a brand spanking new campaign, my very first spell...  Whack.  Got two enemies, myself, and the big fighter type.  Fire hurts.  I knocked my own character to the floor, as close to dead as you can get.  The fighter was hurt, but not too badly.  And I got the enemies fairly well.  But I still did exactly what I spend so much time complaining about.  Maybe just playing a magic user causes brain damage.  But I don't want to talk about that anymore.
<br><br>
I want to talk about inside jokes and game stories.
<br><br>
You all know what it's like.  Every tight knit group has a list of inside jokes.  Phrases that make no sense to anyone that isn't in the know.  It's something very common to professions that have their own languages.  Have you ever talked computers to your mother?  Have you ever listened in on a bunch of lawyers at lunch?  Imagine how incomprehensible gamers are to their peers.  We used to baffle folks in high school by talking about saving throws and armor class.
<br><br>
And even in the course of events inside those groups, phrases come up that only some understand.  For some unknown reason one of those popped into my head this week, and won't go away.  That's because the story behind it is funny.
<br><br>
<b>"What's the eye on his chest for?"</b>
<br><br>
Many, many years ago, I used to play in a game.  It was my first super hero game, and I was at a bit of a loss to name my character.  I had no real story, no background.  I had his powers figured out (a sort of American samurai).  But I had no idea how he got the powers, or what he would be called.  But Jeremy, our GM, insisted that we have an origin story, and at least a name.  So he drew me a cartoon.  I wish I still had it.
<br><br>
An alien ship comes to Earth.  It finds a man and grants him all sorts of powers, and gives him a magic sword.  The man, confused, has no idea what to do, or what to say.  The aliens ask him something like:
<br><br>
"What will you do with your new powers, human?"
<br><br>
"I, um...  dunno.  Fight for truth?  ... "
<br><br>
"And what will you call yourself?"
<br><br>
"Maybe uphold justice..."
<br><br>
"But what will you call yourself?"
<br><br>
"Maybe the American way."
<br><br>
The aliens now look befuddled.  Obviously they have made a poor choice.
<br><br>
"... and fight for justice..."
<br><br>
With a zap they transform his uniform, adding several big letter "J"s to it.
<br><br>
"You shall be called Justice, Captain Justice."
<br><br>
"Or did I already say that?"
<br><br>
And they buzzed off, never to return.
<br><br>
That was early in my gaming hobby.  And that game, and Jeremy's sense of humor, had a great affect on me.  And it was that game that spawned the quote:  "What is the eye on his chest for?"
<br><br>
Early on we were shown our primary enemy.  He was a huge robot with lots of power.  We could beat him off, but never actually defeat him.  After our first encounter we were analyzing what he could do and how to defeat him.  Someplace during this session, someone asked "What is the eye on his chest for?"  He had a large capital "I" right smack in the middle of his metallic chest.  And we debated it, for quite some time.  We were split on what it meant.  I was one of those that believed that it was the first letter of his name (only after noting the many "J"s on my own costume).  Others thought that it might be a compartment with further weaponry.  We even guessed that it might be a sensory device, an "eye".
<br><br>
As a GM, these are often the most amusing parts of a game, when the players are trying to figure out what is going on.  The kinds of things that players will read into your game will always make you laugh.  Some of them you quietly note for use later.  I have been known to giggle aloud sometimes when they assume an extremely intricate plot from some simple situations.
<br><br>
But Jeremy never said a word.  He must have been laughing himself to sleep at night, though.
<br><br>
So we battled on.  Months passed.  We defeated villains, saved the world, rescued the women...  And we drove off the mechanical super freak several times.  Every once in a while, someone would ask, "What is the eye on his chest for?"
<br><br>
Then came the fated day.  We actually beat the big metal bastard.  We drove him into the ground, and we suffered for it.  We were battered and beaten.  But we killed it.  And we dissected it.  One of us was a "focus" character, an electronic genius and a computer whiz.  So we let him take the thing apart.  And still we had no idea why there was an "I" on his chest.
<br><br>
But we moved on.  We saved the world again, jailed the criminals, and built a hideout.
<br><br>
Then we saw him again.  Flying towards us was the big metal freak!  We were shocked.  We had a hard enough time killing it the first time.  We all turned to the computer whiz, wondering how he let it put itself together again.
<br><br>
Then it got close.  And on its chest were two eyes...
<br><br>
Jeremy will always have my respect.  For months he kept his mouth shut.  For all that time he never even gave us a clue that it was not a letter, but a roman numeral...
<br><br>
And it will always be a reminder to me that there are always times when <b>not</b> knowing something as a player is far better than knowing.  I want to discover what the great mysteries are, not have them told to me during our dinner break or on the phone during the week.  Let me discover the fun stuff in EverQuest <b>in</b> the game, not on some web site.  And let me encourage our readers to avoid the lure of easy solutions and let it unfold in the game, don't give the spoiler sites and hint sites any hits.
<br><br>
Maybe next week I'll try to explain  "Pulling a Paul" or "What do you turn into?"
