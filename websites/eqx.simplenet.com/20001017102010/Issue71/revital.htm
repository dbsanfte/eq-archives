<em>Hello, this is Absor.  I wanted to write a short intro to this article to let you know of its origin.  It was written for the Avault newsgroup and was not initially intended for publication here.  But I pestered the author until he let me print it.  I liked it so much because it proves that there really are times when our love for this game makes perfect sense.</em>
<br><br>
I had become a little bummed with EQ. I've been busy so I haven't had a lot of time to play, so my friends have gotten way ahead of me. The higher level they got the less interested I got in playing catch up, so they got even higher level then me.  To the point that now I wasn't even playing.  Finding just a random group is hard and usually not that fun. Then I read that <a href="../Issue69/parttime.htm">EQX article</a> and I realized I had let EQ become too much of a leveling game. All my characters have been elves and since I had always planned to travel when I got higher level I had never left Faydwer.
 <br><br>
    Tonight though I just said screw it and put most of my valuables in the bank and went to the docks to wait for the boat. I fished and admired a very good looking sunset on the ocean. (during my adventures tonight I took 23 screenshots of sunsets/rises alone :) ) Eventually the boat arrived and a bunch of us piled in. I admired the boat (and took screenshots) and felt a lot like a tourist. The boat eventually reached Freeport where I got off and took another barrage of screen shots. I was looking for someone to bind me and one of the people I had been on the boat with had found someone that was doing that. So I met up with them and got bound to the region. They told me they were heading to Qeynos and asked if I wished to join them. Since one person was nearly twice my level and the other 3 or 4 levels higher I usually wouldn't bother grouping with them, since I'd gain no exp.  But I was more interested in seeing Qeynos then leveling, so I went with them (their names were Fenthistlebeard, a gnome, and Leinad, a fellow High Elf, btw).
 <br><br>
Traveling in Antonica is very different then Faydwer, as I quickly found out.  Orc centurions might be annoying, but it's nothing compared to the perils that await you on the roads in Antonica. As we were leaving Freeport. Fen told us to "Watch the skies for Griffins". A ways down the road I spotted a shape on the horizon, I clicked on it and I was told it was a Griffin. I echoed that to the party and Fen yelled "Back up!" something that would make a level 11 guy nervous is something I wouldn't want to tangle with so I quickly complied.  We avoided several more griffins and were halfway through another zone when dawn broke.
 <br><br>
Now I had seen some Hill Giants way far away at night and they didn't look like much. As we were walking along the road we spotted another Hill Giant. It was closer than the others and it was day so I got a much better look at it. Hill Giants are *incredibly* impressive. In most games when you see giants they're just regular monsters scaled up a bit, no big deal. In EQ though it *felt* like a massive beast. As it slowly lumbered it's way through the forest about a game mile away from us it was an impressive moment. I was reminded of when I was hiking in the mountains one time (in real life) and I saw a herd of buffalo. The EQ team is very very very good.
 <br><br>
After that encounter we reached the forest that stood between us and Rivervale. Earlier Fen had told us to be wary of bears but I hadn't thought much of it. I mean, we've fought mythological beasts, who cares about mundane bears? The power of bears was soon revealed. We were walking through the forest in a rather relaxed fashion, as we were no longer in Hill Giant/Griffin country. Suddenly Leinad was attacked by something big and had his hit points quickly knocked down. I turned to see a massive bear chasing him. I tried to help in some way, but I lost track of him then saw his hit points get knocked all the way down. The bear then came after me.  Not knowing the region at all I ran madly in a direction. I had a decent lead on him so I hoped I could reach a zone.  Without warning an arrow came speeding out of the dark and pierced me in the back. (for 59 dmg! A lot at level 6...) A bear fired an arrow at me?! I switched to outside view and saw a shadowy figure behind me. (In Faydwer there are almost no violent npcs just running around btw) I had no idea what was going on but I ran like mad towards a zone and managed to stagger through before I was killed. As I lay battered and bruised on the other side a Paladin walked by and healed me back up (Ah a true Paladin! Don't see many of those in Faydwer). Later Leinad told me he was actually killed by some human. I guess it was the same deranged ranger that attacked me too. He had to go though, so Fenthistlebeard and I managed to find each other and resumed heading towards Rivervale.
 <br><br>
    When I reached Rivervale I immediatly liked the city, despite the odd music that greeted me. While I liked how Ak'anon, Freeport, Felwithe, Kaladim and Kelethin had fit their races, Rivervale did even more so.  I hope Sierra takes some notes for their middle earth game.  After exploring the town we decided to head into the vale bashing grounds for a little bit of leveling (We were also looking for someone to bind us).  After a time we found someone to bind us, but they would only do this for a price. I was skeptical, we'd have to give them the money before they'd bind us and I remembered buying runes in UO that went no where. Fen *very* kindly said he'd pay for both of us though (after bartering down the price). The druid held up his end of the bargain though, and we were bound to Rivervale. After this Fen had to go.
 <br><br>
I was looking around town some more (they have a piranha in the river!) when someone shouted an odd request. They asked to have the invisible spell cast on them (remember; 'lil ol' me is from Faydwer, no evil races).  Since I'm an Enchanter I said I would and I met a Troll ShadowKnight (named Garrak) at the edge of town. When I arrived he lapsed into troll speak ("me kill gobbies but little hummies still don't like me.  Me gud troll!"), which I found amusing. After helping him through town we decided to join up. During this I started effecting a bit of how I thought a High Elf should speak, which made for some funny conversations ("i used have gud killing 2 handed axe, friend has it now", "Oh, I think the Scythe fits you rather nicely").  We bashed monsters for a while until they took down the servers for the patch.
<br><br> 
I started the night pretty bored with EQ but ended full of enthusiasm and my sense of wonderment with the game restored. What a change of scenery and some good players can do. (and eqx :)
