You sit in a small golden grassed meadow in the Plains of Karana. For miles and miles there is no sign of life. You are utterly and hopelessly lost. In the distance you see a band of riders descending down the plains and they stop when they see you.
<br><br>
"Good Morrow," says one of the riders, "how are you today?"
<br><br>
"I am a bit lost." you reply. You stare at them in amazement. They are all clad in the finest plate-mail, something you couldn't even dream of affording.  They are of high level as well, you figure they must know every crevice of Norrath.
<br><br>
"We can help," says one of the other riders "where are you heading?"
<br><br>
This is one of the many dialogues that would be considered in role-play. Not very sophisticated, not very difficult, it is just simply you and your character playing a role. As you are with the riders you may learn more about where they came from, what training they went through to reach such a high level, what monsters they have seen, what illustrious battles they have been through. This is role-play and most people do it without even noticing…
<br><br>
A lot of people complain about people not being able to role-play effectively. Out of all these complaints, I have never once saw a suggestion on how people should role-play and this is what my article is about. The things lying herein are suggestions on what you can do if you are one of those players who is deciding whether he would like to role-play or whether he should treat this as he did Ultima Online.
<br><br>
The Definition of Role-Playing- There are many people out there who can not define role-play. This is one of the hardest things about making a role-play server. I know a lot of people who feel that role-playing IS ruining the fun of others. Most people are against this sociopath ideology but again technically if one is not a sociopath in real life he is technically playing a role…But for the purposes of this article let's say role-playing is your typical D&D, PBEM, text MUD  kind of things.
<br><br>
Throw Out Your Previous Assumptions- A lot of people think that role-playing is either "dorky" or if one role-plays he is taking the game too seriously. Throw this away right now. I know a lot of people if you met them would be considered  "cool" but role-play on their own time to relax. As for taking the game too seriously, I know a whole bunch of people who come home from work or school who rush on to the game and spend around 40 hours a week just playing the game. This of course is taking the game to another extreme, role-play or not. To be a role-player you do not have to speak Elizabethan English and you don't have to be non-pvp.
<br><br>
Ask Yourself if You Want to Make the Commitment- This means do you want to have set boundaries that your character falls into. Will you say to yourself "I am not going to do this or that because my character doesn't like this." Such as, having a character who loves animals never kill one, or a person who fears skeletons never running into the temples where all those un-dead things are likely to stay. A lot of times friends will ask you to join in a fight, and you may say no because of your character. You have to ask whether you will do this or not…
<br><br>
Make your Decision- Think about what you are about to get yourself into and wonder to yourself if you think you have a little extra time that it will take to do a bit of research. I often tell people who don't want to spend the time this question "Who, was a noted player on Ultima Online, that you heard about often on message boards?" Most of the time they would reply "Xavori"…Most have never met him in their lives but they have all heard of him. Why? Because he was a role-player. I often assert that anyone can rush a guy with eight players, it's a difference if you can make it more creative than that. If you can't say that you would want to be a role-player I don't feel you will be a scourge to the game, but please read on a little further.
<br><br>
If you said yes….
<br><br>
You said that you wanted to role-play, what do you need to do. The first thing that I do when I make a character is choose an Alignment (ie Good, Evil, or Neutral). Then you have to ask yourself why?  This is often the most enjoyable part of the Alignment phase. Why are you evil? (I use evil because I usually play an evil character) What virtues do you have, what sort of honour do you uphold. Most people have some compassion in life, how do you demonstrate it?
<br><br>
After the Alignment phase I usually refer people to EQX's Issue #24 Wynn Orill's article about the known races and class mixture in EverQuest as of the E3 Game conference. Now you have to select a race. Twice, I have been asked about Ogres. I have always said that Ogre's are on the low end of the intelligence scale, and to be an Ogre, most likely you can't be the smartest in all of Norrath. I have been told, twice, "but I can play an Ogre any way I want too". I said "Sure you can, but why is he intelligent, what makes him smart. Is he a prodigy or something?" After that people stop asking and opt, rather to explain their Ogre's intelligence, they just play stupid. After that you must pick a class. I hope to get into a role-play dialogue (as I being an evil wizard) with a paladin. I just see great things with him chasing me, kind of like Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. Role-playing is what you make it.
<br><br>
Now, the toughest as well as the most time consuming part: the profile. You now have to write what your character is like, why he picked the class he is in, what are his strengths and what are his WEAKNESSES (I can't stress including weaknesses enough, because in every story the hero has a weakness). You also have to choose where your character comes from (take a look at the Map of Norrath) and why he/she is good, evil, or neutral. Gods are up to you, also I would include the likes and the dislikes of your character.
<br><br>
The name is another integral part of the equation. I usually string "big vocabulary" words together, such as my name Sardonic (meaning sarcastic) and Rendarr (which is a take on one of my favorite Star Wars character's Dash Rendar) Also, words in other languages are great too.
<br><br>
Finally, you have to find a group of people who are like minded about the role-playing issue. I would check out any links page one one of the many EverQuest fan sites, or on the EverQuest Official home page.
<br><br>
So here are the steps in order of the phases: 
<br><br>
Alignment Phase<br>
Race & Class Phase<br>
Character Profile Phase<br>
Name Phase<br>
Guild Phase
<br><br>
As a role-player you have some responsibility to go out and recommend to others what you have found and what you like to do. Never ever lecture about this, no one wants to have a second parent on-line, remember they are partially escaping reality too. Always offer advice and never criticize.
<br><br>
If you said no…
<br><br>
You don't want to be a role-player because you don't want to take the time. How can you stop from being the scourge of the game? Well, it's easy. Don't use the vernacular, always put OOC (out of character) in front of things that are in real life. Respect people who are role-playing by not spamming them etc. etc. If someone tries to role-play with you, play along it's the least you can do. Also, if you still are one of those people who wants to kill everyone that moves, at least have the respect enough not to bad mouth the people you kill. I think everyone should have fun in their own way, but none of it should be traumatizing.
<br><br>
I hope you can learn a bit, and I would love to hear some feedback from you…
