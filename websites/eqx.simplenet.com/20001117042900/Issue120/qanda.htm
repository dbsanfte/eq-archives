  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Quick roleplaying question - would a wise-cracking, ladies' 
  man Monk be considered inappropriate based on EQ's history? I'm relatively new 
  to Norrath and cannot find any concrete evidence either way. The character would 
  still stay true to a lot of Monk cliches - he would just be a lot more vocal 
  about them.<br>
  Joe Z.</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> I don’t have a hard and fast answer for you on this one but my interpretation 
  would be as follows: Every class will have members which follow the ideals of 
  the class slavishly, i.e., in this case perhaps it would be expected that a 
  monk would naturally be more introverted, focused on his or her causes, the 
  silent solitary type, etc. However, I can’t think of rules that would preclude 
  anyone from roleplaying the character as an iconoclast or rebel or even as a 
  kind of a fringe member of the class. It makes sense to me that a monk could 
  indeed be a ladies man, even if his guild had tried to make him repress such 
  ideas, and it makes sense that a ladies’ man would be a more extraverted and 
  vocal person. Roleplaying in Norrath, from what I have seen, is rarely highly 
  stylized and I know of no set of rules that have to be applied to developing 
  a character. Most people who roleplay try very hard to bring life to their character 
  as an individual rather than trying to match up with some standardized version 
  of proper roleplay. Of course, I could be saying this because I happen to find 
  ladies’ men charming and would hate to lose even one such from the lands, but 
  such is not the case. Rather, to me, it would be extremely boring to greet each 
  monk on the road and find that their guilds had brainwashed them so deeply that 
  no remnant of individuality, much less flirtation, remained. So, I say -- go 
  for it. Play your monk the way you imagine him and enjoy bringing life and breath 
  to him.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I was looking at one of Ozy's old stories and discovered 
  that Aradune was surnamed Mithara. Since Brad has left Verant, this led my son 
  to ask, "Does he get to keep Aradune?" Being a realist and knowing how business 
  works I am sure he does not. However, I wanted to ask if anyone knows if Aradune 
  is gone from Norrath? If he is, will another avatar take his place?<br>

  <b>A:</b> And just which dark-elf spreading misunderstandings and untruths has 
  been whispering in your ear? Goodness, there always seems to be a campaign out 
  of the evil realms to denigrate the power of Aradune and the Fiery Avenger. 
  However, judging by the fact that he was recently seen on many of the servers, 
  Aradune is alive and well and indeed, as far as anyone I know can tell, is still 
  animated only by Brad. I’m not sure where you heard that Brad left Verant but 
  I sure haven’t seen anything like that at all. As far as I know, Brad McQuaid 
  (hope I spelled it right and waits for the flame of the Avenger to fall on my 
  shoulders if I didn’t) is still at Verant and is involved in the *Vision* thing 
  for EverQuest, as always.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Hello, how do you make your own hot-keys in EQ? I can "copy" 
  SOCIALS and SKILLS into my Hot-Key menus for use in the wide screen view. However 
  when you edit these buttons it also edits the original and any other copies. 
  Is there a way to create brand new buttons? The manual tells you how to copy 
  buttons and edit buttons but not to create buttons.<br>
  Thank you,<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Your question confuses me as I am not sure what you mean by making 
  your own hotkeys. Essentially, you have two areas where you can customize your 
  play that I can think of. One is you can reassign key functions for the keyboard 
  and the other is you have six banks of six hot buttons each to which you can 
  assign inventory slots, skills, spells, songs and socials. The socials can be 
  the ones designated by EQ or you can change the content of the socials with 
  some limitations, finalize it and then move the button over to a hot key. Since 
  there weren’t too many new questions this week, I’m going to include a sampling 
  of hot key/keyboard answers and advice that we have run in EQ Express which 
  I hope will help answer your question and allow you to maximize the use of the 
  hotkeys: </font></p>

  In the Q & A in issue 83 someone asked how to make a macro... My question is 
  how do I memorize spells into the hotkey spots on the bottom left like those 
  on the screenshot shown. I have asked people in game but they always say just 
  click on the spell in the book and drag to the left. I want them on the bottom 
  as well.. thanks for your help<br>

  I understand how to set up Macros on the Social Keys but what about hot keys, 
  specifically the user defined ones. I haven't been able to program these keys 
  other than edit the stock ones (i.e. A for attack) provided by Verant.<br>
  - Golodorn, level 10 fighter After reading your recent answer about how to create 
  macros, it got me to wondering... Trying to keep my skills honed, I often use 
  a weapon with which I am less than optimally proficient. Occasionally, I get 
  in such a dire straight that I wish to switch to my "preferred" weapon type 
  (in this case 1H Slash). Is there a way to create a hotkey that will change 
  weapons? Thanks and keep up the great work.<br>
  - Kerix </i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A: 
  The Macro Issue</b><br>
  Macros can be highly effective in making your character fight better, and especially 
  work better in teams. Here are some answers and tips. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
  hotkey any button simply left click and hold the button until it releases and 
  becomes your cursor. Move it over to your hotkey pad and left click over the 
  slot you want it to be in and it will drop off your cursor. This works for spells, 
  social commands, and inventory slots.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Spells</b> - I use my hotkey pad for spells and organize them by purpose. 
  I have my "combat pad" which currently holds the spells I find myself as a cleric 
  using most often in combat. I also have a "Buff pad" which has all the buffs 
  I cast during combat downtime. Just right click and hold on the spell from the 
  8 spell slots after you have memorized it, and bring it down to a hotkey pad. 
  I also have on my combat pad the single most important grouping social button 
  you can create - /assist.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Social commands</b> - From your windowed screen, you will see buttons on 
  the middle right which say "Combat" "Main" and "Socials". Click on the socials 
  and you will see a few rows of buttons that do some commonly used commands like 
  AFK. These buttons can be hot-keyed, and also can be edited to create your own 
  socials. You can put any /command in there and make a button of it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
  create a social macro, right-click on a social button that you wish to edit 
  or change. In the middle "text" box will appear a multi-line form with a heading 
  on top. Edit the heading to label the button so that you will be able to distinguish 
  it from your other buttons, and label it, of course, with something you can 
  remember. For example, I label my /assist key "Assist". Below the heading you 
  can enter a multiple number of commands, one per line. /say, /g, /assist, /who 
  all friends, all are good candidates for macro buttons. Each line is just that 
  - one line. The text doesn't wrap. Also Each line is short - keep it brief, 
  and use more than one line do accomplish a long action. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here 
  are some of the more useful uses of the social macro:</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Pet commands</b> - I have a mage who has a complete bank of pet commands. 
  When I need to, I switch to the pet command bank and hit the appropriate key, 
  such as the "PBO" key (/pet back off). I have the "PA" key (/pet attack) on 
  my combat bank of buttons.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Assist</b> - /assist targets and attacks what your target is attacking. Sounds 
  a bit confusing, but here is how I use it. When grouped I usually pick out one 
  person to be the attacker. That person selects what the group is to kill by 
  attacking it. Once the fight starts, I target that person using the appropriate 
  Fkey and then hit the assist button. If the whole group does the same, we are 
  all attacking the same creature. Once that foe goes down, the targeting party 
  member attacks another foe and we all switch to that one.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  When not grouped and someone is running past me yelling for help, I try to click 
  on the person and heal them. However, sometimes I target their attacker by accident, 
  so I just hit the assist key and now I am targeting the person attacked, i.e., 
  the poor schmuck running past me. It's much quicker that running and trying 
  to click on some guy fleeing for his life. If that person then turns to fight 
  and I pitch in to help, I can monitor the character's health bar by flicking 
  back and forth between our mutual foe and the foe's target - the character.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Multi-line social commands</b> -Here is one of my favorites:<br>
  /say My God, what does a dwarf have to do to get some peace and quiet around 
  here?<br>
  /em grumbles.<br>
  /em hunkers down to contemplate the ways of Brell<br>
  This is my meditate in the Crushbone throne room button J. You can make multi-line 
  social by merely adding commands to each line. Creative players make the combination 
  of emotes, says, and commands fun. My /assist hotkey has a /say I will help 
  you, my friend! </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
  friend of mine has a complicated sword drawing and attacking emote which is 
  pretty cool.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Combat commands</b> - for leaders and those of you that group often, common 
  group messages such as "Out of mana", "ZONE", "RUN", and "Heal please" are great 
  hotkeys.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>Inventory slots</b> - Inventory slots can be right click, hold, and dragged 
  just like any button. This is the simplest method to switch weapons - you just 
  must make sure that you keep that slot open all the time for the switch. Make 
  that inventory slot a hotkey, and hotkey your held weapon also. It's a more 
  complicated dance for two-handed vs. one-handed switches, I haven't puzzled 
  it out yet, but I know it can be done. Another thing handy is the use of a inventory 
  slot for potions.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I have a question about Social Hot Keys. I have been trying 
  to make a social with more than two lines in it. Something like Line1: /s Tag 
  your It.Line2: /s Can't tag the butcher. But when I run this hot key, it only 
  is showing the first line. (I have checked both mine, and my roommates screens). 
  Is there anyway to get multiple lines in these hot keys to work? Another question 
  on the same topic... Is it possible to ad a target to the phrase? Eg) /s Tag 
  you're it <<target>>translates into: Ranini says "Tag you're it Nepenthia" <br>
  Ranini </i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> 
  Ok, I spent a considerable time last night near the orc lift in Kelethin, driving 
  passersby and a very cute gnome "socials" partner crazy with my attempts to 
  find some way to use the social keys as you have described. As you discovered 
  there is no way to set multiple lines and have more than one of them show up 
  using /tell or /say. There is also no way to wrap a long sentence to more than 
  one line. It's the Anti-Bard League at work again! So to do as you would like, 
  you have a couple of options. If you are trying to use the multiple socials 
  with someone not in /emote range, you will have to do each phrase as a separate 
  social and then set each social to a hot key. When they are set, you simply 
  click the hot keys in order as fast as you can. Answering your second question, 
  I could find no way to use target with a socials button except if you are using 
  a pre-programmed emote. In that case, if you target a player and hit a socials 
  hotkey or button, it will name the player as part of the emote. One thing to 
  remember: If you are within /emote distance, you can have each line of a social 
  box with a separate emote and they WILL all show up to those around you. Thus 
  you could type: Line 1: /em hollers, "Tag you're It!" followed by Line 2: /em 
  notes, "Can't tag the butcher" and put both phrases on one hotkey. You can also 
  use preprogrammed socials on hotkeys and set off 5 at once that way.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> This isn't so much a question but a tip. Being a long time 
  Tribes player I have spent a long time revamping my keyboard for playing and 
  this is something I have found works very very well and will really help you 
  out especially when fighting on the run. Revamp the following: "Target nearest 
  NPC" to Keypad Enter; "Autoattack" to Keypad 0; "Consider" to Keypad +; "Target 
  nearest PC" to Keypad . This setup allows for rapid target acquire and attack 
  also you can keep one hand on the hotkeys and really get a quick blast off. 
  Another simple tip is to remap "open" to your now empty space bar-- it is just 
  a lot easier to run away like that. For those of you who like the mouselook, 
  go ahead and put your "User Defined's" into keypads 1,2,4,5,7,and 8 then forward 
  at keypad 9 and backward at keypad 3 this will allow everything at one place 
  but will take a while to get used to. Center look at keypad six is good with 
  this setup. It may be a lot to swallow but it can really save some time and 
  every second counts. Also once you get used to it you will be sure to be the 
  fastest on the draw in those places where engaging first counts.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> I think I follow you on this and it's a good example how there is 
  a fair amount of flexibility in setting up your keyboard to match your personal 
  style of playing. Thanks for writing.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> In issue 98 you had a question concerning "hotkeying a message". 
  You mentioned that it appeared there was a lot of space for a long message but 
  there isn't really. *** There are 5 lines in the edit box when you edit a socials. 
  Each line can accept a command. Clicking the button can then send 5 commands 
  in a row! This is very handy when doing language spamming for instance as you 
  will transmit 5 '/gsay's from one click! You can also extend a message for auctions 
  by just repeating the /auction and continuing your test. I personally use it 
  for special emotes and sayings that will pop up ALL TOGETHER on the screen thereby 
  making them seem more 'realistic'.<br>

  Hi Nep! Just found out about your column. I am wondering how to set up my hotkeys

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> 
  Yes there is a way and I must acknowledge it was taught to me way way back in 
  beta by an old crotchety bard who would rather keep his nose tucked in a book 
  of lore than answer 3948495 questions from me. However, he did graciously teach 
  me how to use my hotkeys and I pass this learning along to you. First, the best 
  thing to do it make sure most of your inventory keys and your melee slots are 
  empty. It just makes it easier. Then choose the bank of hot keys you wish and 
  click on melee one to slide the slot over to the top left position on your hot 
  key bank. Next click on the melee two slot and move it over. Then pick four 
  numbered slots from inventory and fill the rest of your bank with those slots. 
  Once that is done, put your weapon in the first melee slot. Put your instruments 
  in the inventory slots that match the numbers on your hot key slots. You will 
  then see your weapon in the top left corner and your instruments in the lower 
  boxes. To move it, click on the weapon, move it and click on the instrument 
  of choice, exchange them, and move the instrument up to the second melee slot 
  (where instruments insist on going). Others may have even better ways to handle 
  this but I find that I keep my most used spells on hotkey bank 1, my instruments 
  and weapons on hotkey bank2, and a set of travelling hotkeys on hotkey bank 
  three. The one drawback of this arrangement is that if you have a light, water, 
  food and a backpack, there isn't too much more room for carrying stuff. But, 
  what the heck, bards travel lightly.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I often wondered if there was a simpler way to switch between 
  your "hotboxes" or whatever they're referred to. It seems really difficult to 
  keep moving my mouse over to the little arrow in the middle of battle or if 
  I needed to say something I put in a macro. <br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Yes, there is a simple keyboard method to access the different banks 
  of hotkeys. If you hold down the shift key and type 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, you 
  can gain quick keyboard access to each of the sets of hotkeys. I know I have 
  a set of hotkeys for quick access to useful bard songs, another set up for melee 
  weapon and instrument changes, and a third one set up for traveling, so the 
  shift key is definitely a help.</font></p>
