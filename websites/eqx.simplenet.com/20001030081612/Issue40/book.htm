Brian McNaughton has managed to get me to do something that I haven't done in over 15 years:  Read a fantasy novel.
<br><br>
It's not that Fantasy is a subject I don't enjoy, it's just that the marketing kills my interest.  In a world where the 'latest thing' dictates what is to be produced and how it's marketed, it becomes increasingly difficult to single out original contributions to the genre.  I typically find horror and science fiction authors to be more inventive (and of course less derivative of Tolkien).  
<br><br>
What McNaughton has created in his anthology <em>Throne of Bones</em>, is a fantasy world worthy of exploration.  Mind you this is not the sunny fantasy of most novelists, it is an unceasingly dark world populated by necromancers, zombies and ghouls.  The best characters are not the typical stuff of the heroic archetype.  The most intriguing characters are such things as a young female ghoul, an inspector of moats, a poet, a fashion designer and his sister, and a plethora of other richly disturbing characters.
<br><br>
The plots are somewhat unconventional, in an H. P. Lovecraft sort of way, but tend to overlap.  Each story has some tiny bit which points toward the next tale.  Together they make for a strong, if somewhat gruesome creation.
<br><br>
One of the real surprises of the book is McNaughton's dark sense of humor which surfaces at times when he makes fun of trends, rumors, and even the writing of tales.
<br><br>
I alluded to Lovecraft above, and while McNaughton certainly writes with his own voice, his writing does at times become a bit flowery (for lack of a less ironic term). At times his characters are beholden to horrors both of the soul and of a more substantial nature.  If you are not put off by such things as cannibalism and necrophilia then this book is worth a read.
<br><br>
If you are not convinced by me, then read <a href=" http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0965813509/qid%3D906180635/002-0666803-2122260">more information</a> (including comments from the author) at www.amazon.com 
<br><br>
While I find rating systems a bit silly (Because they say Nothing could be higher than "this" that we've rated the highest), I too would give it 5-stars.
