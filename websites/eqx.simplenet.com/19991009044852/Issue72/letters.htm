I just read the issue 71 <a href="../Issue71/edita.htm">editorial</a> "don't make Norath Sour" and while the point is justifiable, you present a problem, get the reader to think about it, tell what one solution is, and then say don't use this solution. What is with that, never say, don't do that with out giving an alternative. Ok I won't Train when someone screws with me, but what do I do?  What do I do? One more time What DO I DO? This is the worst form of article, in that you try to change behavior by asking people to stop doing something with out giving them an alternative. You could have said, move along to a different place, or get all the opposing party's names and patron a GM when one is on line, maybe they have prior offences or a bad rep? 
<br><br> 
I just think your article had a good point, and was well written, but delivered in a wrong way. The whole example of invisible mages and Necromancers looked to lead to a solution.

Hoi there boss!
<br><br>
This is Lrets, (I'm at work right now so don't read this too loud :P ) I just finished reading the issue 71. More specifically i just finished reading Absor's editorial, and well golly geez me but if it didn't cause my eyes to bubble up a bit! (Actually there was this big dust cloud that flew by at just that instance ...really!) I just wanted to write to folks over a EQX and say I've loved EVERY issue I've read (started around 22 or so but I read all the back issues, and you cannot believe how TRULY HONORED I am that you print some of my Fit to Print submissions. In any case, I really am writing to say "Thank You", and to encourage you to continue trying to do what you can to help ALL players of EQ make EQ be as much of an enjoyable experience as possible. I hope and pray that people will read Absor's article and really take what he said ... err wrote, to heart.
 <br><br>
    It really is an inspiring thing to see that people are out there putting forth a true effort to create a nicer world to live in. even if it really only is a game world. However, just as Absor said, sometimes events from the game world will spill out into the "real world". Good insight and vision Absor I bow down to ye'r magnificence :P
 <br><br>
Take Care folks and be well!

P.S. Oh! BTW this isn't a kiss-up job to get a desk at the office with one o' this nice Combine metal name plates, but if'n ye got an open desk I'd be more than happy to take one! :) *Ducks out as an "EQExpress" mug flies his way*
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - Good thing it's not a kiss-up job, 'cause I can spot those miles away!  From all of us I want to say thanks.  And don't kid yourself, I only print your stuff because it's good.]</em>

I just wanted to write in and let Oghma know how happy I was to find out that I am not the only <a href="../issue71/confess.htm">Characteraholic</a> out there.  I too am addicted to making character after character.  I just can't help myself.  Maybe one day I'll settle down to 2 or 3 only.  I doubt it will be soon though.  I enjoy casting spells as well as swinging swords.  I also enjoy strumming strings as much as I like crafting fine objects and selling them at a booth in the city.  I love to play all sorts of characters.  I too have had the feeling of just not being able to stick to one thing and finish it.  However, You know what?  I can enjoy being a weak merchant running, screaming for his life, from a fire beetle just as much as I enjoy being a powerful warrior hacking down rows and rows of goblins and minotaurs.  I suppose when it come to these games I suffer from a sort of need for multiple personalities.  My friends are all ahead of me and I don't even care.  I'm taking it slow, enjoying the scenery, smelling the flowers.  I'm roleplaying and I'm having a blast doing it.  So Oghma I'm right there with you bud.  Don't worry about the Quantity fo the levels you have, worry about the Quality of fun you had getting the few you have.

I wholeheartedly agree with your take on how two wrongs make a bigger
wrong. In all my time gameing usually the people who scream "it's just a
game" get the most upset and bitter when the players use the same tricks
used on them. People really need to realise that this isn't Baldur's
Gate. When you zap that other player you are really zapping that other
player. Most of the time we are able to divorce ourselves from what
occurs to us in this fantasy world. But when someone spends a great deal
of time on something, they invest something of themself in that thing.
An emotional bond as it were. To say "it's just a game" when behaving
like a moron belittles yourself, and the time investment you've made.
<br><br>
As an aside, I live in the Denver area, and have co-workers with
children that attend Columbine. To say that tuesday was horrifying is an
extreme understatement. What really amazes me about all of this is that
I've read people making light of these events. I can only help but
wonder, have I met one of these kids? Will I never see a certain
character in game again and be forced to wonder? It's a game, but the
people are real. Try to remember that on occasion before you have reason
to regret what you've done.
