A long time ago when I was a child my dad read to me the book, "The Hobbit."  At the age of seven, I was transported to the world of dragons, wizards and high adventures!  This is where my love was born for the world of fantasy books.  At the age of eight my dad bought me a great game called "The Dark Tower," again it was involving adventure and fighting and victory of conquering the Dark Tower!  By the time I was 12 years old, I was soon involved with a cousin making endless maps of dungeons and places to explore, creating a few characters and trying out Dungeons and Dragons for the first time.  
<br><br>
This was in 1982, when the role playing games were noticed by the general population, movies were made about people who developed a mental illness and stayed in their fantasy worlds.  People (and my mother) were convinced it was the devil's game, so at the age of 13 I left my beloved fantasy world books and game and ventured on to other interests that were more becoming of a young girl.  Gone were the days of my dreams of fighting dragons and searching for fairy rings in my backyard.  
<br><br>
Fast forward to February 1999, and here I am, a 28 year old woman, going back to college and involved in a loving relationship with my soon to be husband.  My father had passed away and I was trying to figure out life for myself.  This is where I met up with my first love again.  My fiancé had been checking out a Website <a href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a> repeatedly for months!  He talked day in and day about this Multi-player Online game.  Our lives soon became entwined with this very word: EverQuest.  
<br><br>
My interest of course was peaked at what this world could bring.  Thoughts, long hidden in the age of childhood, brought back to life.  Humans, Dwarves, Elves all fighting against the evil of a land!  Oh my enchantment with this world was brought back full force.  This was THE GAME to play in 1999, and my fiancé and I had secured a beta four account.  Our CD arrived amidst many packages and letters and mysteriously dropped between some boxes.  We were frantic! We looked and lamented that we would not be able to participate.  We did not have an email from Verant either that gave us our account key! We panicked and called the 800 number that we found on the webpage.  
<br><br>
Finally, Wednesday February 10, 1999 came.  We finally found the CD, got the account number and installed!  Only one computer to share between us seemed to be reasonable, since we both had agreed to share our playing time, our love was beyond bickering over computer time.  No luck logging on that night, so around 3am we finally went to sleep and vowed to try the next day.  Thursday came and my fiancé had success! Hurrah! We were in.  Amidst smiles and happiness, we created our own characters and that when the real battle began.  Not the battle of good vs. evil, but the battle between my beloved and me!  
<br><br>
It has been two weeks now and we are beginning to bicker and fight over who had the longest time on the computer.  Who has to log off and go do this errand or cook dinner while the other gets to play.  Accusations and finger pointing started to happen.  Our selfish desires to play, play, play took over!  We whined over not finding people to group with,  complained about our deaths, how slow this one computer is.   We have become two competing people in a struggle to become the strongest characters in this game.  We sigh and pout when the other plays, we watch intensely at the screen (in the other chair) while the other one gets to play.  We covet each others time and we become critics of one another's game playing.  I just know he should have run away from the bandits in Highpass Hold! I told him to go back to the guard tower when his companion came running toward the cave mouth, but he just stood there!  His journey to Freeport was cut short.  He knew that I should follow the group instead of chatting to another player, and when I died his famous, "I told you so" came out which in turn infuriated me.  
<br><br>
Our candles burn long into the night as we both stay up to watch, with envy, the other play; to satiate our wanting to be in EverQuest one way or another.  However, each night when the computer is turned off, and our room becomes quiet and the only sound is the clock ticking past the 4am hour, we let go our frustrations, our envy, our selfishness go and hold each other close.   Knowing that the next day we will go through the same thing again (and again) until we buy another computer.  We laugh at our petty jealousies, and decide that there really was no way out of dying from trying to run through Froon's (the local friendly hill giant of Karanas) legs, or that his monk just couldn't round kick the grizzly bear enough and didn't run away in time.  Ah, the joy of being in EverQuest, the joy of being a couple fighting for the rights of computer time.  There is one thing we do agree on, EverQuest is the most intriguing and technologically advanced online game to this date.  We cannot wait to play on the commercial version of the game, and as Sony puts it, we are definitely "in their world now."
