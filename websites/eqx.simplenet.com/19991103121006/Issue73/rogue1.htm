<b>Part One</b>
<br><br>
   Kinory ran along the forest floor, heart pumping, reddish-blonde hair streaming out behind her. The wind of her passage sang in her ears.  Her feet moved quicker than thought, flickering among the undergrowth.  Behind her, she could hear the heavy footfalls of her pursuer. Her heart was filled with the fearful joy of pursuit, her blood rushing madly in her veins.  She leapt over a fallen tree, landed lightly, and spun to search the trees behind her.  She was panting, but only slightly, her lithe, trim body corded with muscle from a life in the wilderness of the Greater Faydark forest.  He came out of the gloom of the trees and lunged toward her.
<br><br>
   "Beat you," she sang out, as her half-brother vaulted the log and slid to a halt beside her.  She laughed triumphantly as he collapsed, sprawling on the soft grass.  She sat down beside him, folding her legs beneath her primly.
<br><br>
   "Mother is right," he panted.  "You <em>are</em> the wind's daughter."  He launched himself at her and pinned her to the ground.  He grinned down at her.  "But I'm still the stronger."
<br><br>
   "No fair!" she said, struggling furiously.  "You're twice my size!"
<br><br>
   "I'd say it's about as fair as you challenging me to a footrace," he said, letting her wiggle out from under him.  He tossed his fair hair out of his eyes.  "Everyone knows, halfbreeds are slow and stupid."  The tone was light, but the words echoed the bitterness in his green eyes.  
<br><br>
   "Oh, Gwyn, no one says that."  Kinory laid a small brown hand on his arm.
<br><br>
   "Except Holyd." He gave her a crooked smile.
<br><br>
   "Well, my father is in many ways, a very slow and stupid Wood Elf," said Kinory defiantly.  Gwyn looked away, and she sighed.  "He's been making it hard for you recently.  I think he's trying to make you leave, Gwyn.  All those snide little sideways comments."  Gwyn avoided her eyes.  She watched her brother's profile, tears welling in her eyes.  "Don't let him, Gwyn.  Mother and I need you."       
<br><br>
    "Don't worry, squirt."  He faced her again, and chucked her under the chin with rough affection.  "This is my home. I won't be driven from it.  Not by him, or anyone else."  She returned his gaze with doubt in her eyes.  She knew how much her father's comments affected Gwyn.  He felt like an interloper, not only in Holyd's house, but in the whole of Kelethin.  Unable to meet her gaze for long, he leapt to his feet.  "I'll… I'll see you back at the house, Kin.  I have some thinking to do."  He walked away.  Kinory looked after him helplessly.  
<br><br>
   She didn't want her brother to leave - she loved him fiercely - but this endless sniping that went on between her father and him was wearing at him terribly.  Her mother, drawn unwillingly into their conflict, was torn between defending her son and supporting her husband.  Kinory couldn't understand why she would have married such an obvious racist, when she had a son by a Human. Maya was so strong, and Holyd such a weak bully, and yet Maya never stood up to him.  There were many things she did not understand about her parents' relationship.
<br><br>
   Maya had been a talented and respected member of the Ranger Guild in Kelethin.  In her youth, she had been expected to sit on the Council and perhaps even on the City Elder's Meet, in time.  Instead, she had met a Human Paladin while fighting a group of Orcs in the forest.  He had happened on her as she was losing to three of the hulking soldiers.  He had bought her time to escape and they had spent two weeks in the wilderness, cut off from civilization by the raiding Orc parties.  When the threat had finally abated, they parted ways, he to his duties back in Qeynos, she to hers at Kelethin.  Nine months later, Gwyn had been born.  She had given up her responsibilities to the Rangers to fulfill those to her newborn son.  
<br><br>
   Her parents never spoke of how they had met, or their courtship, or anything about their relationship before their marriage.  Kinory supposed that they must have loved one another, but there was precious little of that feeling left.  Her house was a cold and bitter place, uneasy and lacking in the things that made a dwelling a home.  Her father owned a fletching shop across from the Warriors guild and was the very epitome of all the things her mother was not.  Tight fisted, narrow minded and suspicious, he was a very hard man to love.  Kinory supposed that she did love him, but it was more out of a sense of duty than anything else.  She loved her mother, but it was her brother that she adored.  The idea of him leaving was like a cold fist in her gut.  
<br><br>
   She glanced up at the sun, and swore softly to herself.  Her father was never going to believe that it had taken this long to run to the goods store and back again.  She sprang to her feet and raced back through the trees.  
<br><br>
    Soon, she could see the soaring platforms of Kelethin through the branches above.   The massive wooden constructions were high above the forest floor, accessible only by the magic lifts that slid up and down the mighty treetrunks that supported the Wood Elf city.  Swinging bridges of rope and wooden planks connected the platforms, and ramps led from level to level.  Kelethin was home to hundreds of Wood Elves, and the center of a wide, loosely connected web of villages and camps.  Unlike most races, the slight Elves of the forest largely disdained the crowding and constriction that came with city life.  Kelethin itself was open to the air, free and not cut off from the wilderness around it by walls or gates.  Their defense was their position, far above the ground, and out of reach of any danger that threatened.  Yet lately, the Orcs of Clan Crushbone had become much more aggressive, and had been seen close to Kelethin.  The Guards were on alert, and they had begun sharing patrols with the guards of Felwithe, although usually the two races of Elves kept to themselves.  The young people of both cities had been warned to stay close to home.  Several travelers had disappeared in the woods without a trace.  
<br><br>
   Kinory rode up on a smaller lift with a few Rangers.  They eyed her with small frowns.  It was late, and she was young to be out by herself on the forest floor in these times of danger.  She avoided their eyes and ran off the lift as soon as it reached the top.  She pelted through the city, slowing only when her house came into view.  It was situated on the third level, and sat alone on a private platform.  Her father didn't like neighbors.  
<br><br>
   Kinory slipped quietly through the front door of her home, and paused, listening.  She let out a breath, and eased the door shut.  If she could make it to her room...
<br><br>
   "Kinory!" 
<br><br>
   She winced, and tried to quickly brush the twigs from her short tunic.  Her father came toward her with that familiar angry stride, and a look on his face that bespoke another of his famous tongue lashings.
<br><br>
   "Yes, father?" she said innocently, tucking the evidence of her escapade in her pocket unobtrusively.  He seized her hand and jerked it out.  Woodland debris scattered across the floor.
<br><br>
   "You were out in the forest again," he said, shaking his head.  "I thought I made myself very clear about that.  No more runs until the Orc threat abates!"
<br><br>
   "Oh, father, there hasn't been an attack in weeks.  And I was about to go mad.  Even Mother said I could go."    Her father turned as Kinory's mother, Maya, stepped out of the main room.
<br><br>
   "Maya?" he said in disbelief.  "Surely you didn't."
<br><br>
   "Oh, Holyd, she is young.  She has my Ranger blood in her."  Maya smiled at her daughter and gave her a conspiritory wink.  Kinory hid a grin.  "Besides, she had Gwyn with her.  I am sure there was no danger."
<br><br>
    "That...<em>boy</em> would be of no use if they stumbled over an Orc attack party.  And if he is such a good guardian, where is he now?"
<br><br>
    "Well, we..." began Kinory.
<br><br>
   "He took off again I suppose."  Holyd shook his head again.  "Go to your chamber."
<br><br>
   "But, father..." Kinory protested.
<br><br>
   "Go!" 
<br><br>
   She followed the pointed finger with a heavy heart.  It was like this all the time.  Gwyn was blamed for everything.  She tried to stay out of trouble, but it didn't seem to help.  He and her father could strike sparks in a downpour.  She slammed the door and flung herself on the bed.  
<br><br>
   Later, as she sat staring out the window and longing to be outside, the front door opened again.  Rising voices invaded the house, punctuated by her mother's murmurs.  Her father shouted something, and the door slammed.  Kinory leaned out her window and saw Gwyn running down the ramp below.
<br><br>
   "Gwyn!" she shouted.  He stopped and looked up at her.  His face was red and wet.  He ducked his head and scrubbed at his cheeks.
<br><br>
   "You were right," he said.  He met her eyes again.  "I'm leaving, squirt.  No way around it."
<br><br>
   "Oh, Gwyn."  She fought tears.  "Weren't you going to say goodbye, even?"  She climbed out the window and dropped lightly to the ground.  Gwyn came over and wrapped his arms around her.  She hugged him back fiercely.
<br><br>
   "Bye, Kinory," he said into her hair, and then let go.  He turned away immediately, and went on down the ramp.  
<br><br>
   "Gwyn!" she shouted again.  He turned, walking backwards.  "Write me!"
<br><br>
   "I will," he called, and then he was gone around the bend.  Kinory shivered in the cool evening air.  Inside, her mother's voice was raised.  Her father shouted back and then something broke with a crash.  She looked up at the sky and closed her eyes.  
<br><br>
   "I'm leaving too, Gwyn," she whispered.  "Someday I'll come find you."
