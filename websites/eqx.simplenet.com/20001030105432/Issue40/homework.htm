<br><br>
The alarm rings and I looked at the clock.  It's 6:00am.  I assumed I had forgot to set the alarm for my usual Wednesday "work from home" wakeup time.  I roll over and shut the alarm off, cursing at myself for forgetting.  I lay there in bed thinking of something to put me back to sleep, but its no use.  You know how you get use to a certain time to wake up and nothing can prevent you from waking up at that exact time.  <em>I hate that</em>!
<br><br>
Now at 6:15am the house comes to life with three teenagers trying to get ready for school.  I began to hear shouting.
<br><br>
"Don't push me!"
<br><br>
SLAM!
<br><br>
SMACK!
<br><br>
"I'm telling!"
<br><br>
SLAM!
<br><br>
I listened to this sound lying there in bed.  The veins start to swell on my head.  I know this because I can feel them throbbing.  My teeth clench together, making a grinding sound.  Finally, not able to stand it any longer I screamed at the top of my lungs.
<br><br>
"I AM TRYING TO SLEEP!" 
<br><br>
Silence… &nbsp;&nbsp; .. &nbsp;&nbsp;  .. &nbsp;&nbsp;  .. &nbsp;&nbsp; then..
<br><br>
"Don't you touch me!"
<br><br>
Not even bending my knees to touch my feet to the floor, I sprung to my feet in one complete motion.  I swung the door open with a "WHAM!", and found the first child I could get my hands on.  
<br><br>
"I am trying to sleep and all I can hear is your VOICE!!" I screamed.  
<br><br>
My youngest daughter looks up at me with her normal twelve-year-old attitude face and says.
<br><br>
"He won't let me in the bathroom." And points an accusing finger at our oldest and only son.  "And he hit me." She added.
<br><br>
Not being fazed one ounce from the "Innocent look" I leaned down to get close to them both.
<br><br>
"When I'm sleeping I don't want to be woke up!  You're both grounded.  If I hear another sound out of either of you, I'll double the length."  I say in an overly grouchy voice.  
 <br><br>
I entered the bedroom and slammed the door, and climbed back into bed.  
<br><br>
For at least fifteen minutes I tried to go back to sleep, but with no success.  I was thoroughly alert.  
<br><br>
I got out of bed and walked into the living room.  The kids were there, watching TV on the couch, while waiting for the bus.  I growled at them and walked into the kitchen to start the morning brew.  
<br><br>
Finally after my first cup of coffee the kids were gone and I headed down into the computer room to fire up the remote computer connection.  I logged into the system and checked my email.  In corporate America, ninety nine percent of your daily job is reading email, and then creating more email for someone else to read, so that in turn, they can create even more mail.  I find myself sorting through at least fifty to one hundred messages a day.  Needless to say, it's hard as hell to keep on top of it.  
<br><br>
After reading my email I checked the routers.  Everything is UP UP!  I smile to myself and turn to my "Game Machine".  I began to play one of my favorite games.  I got about twenty minutes into the action when the first pager beeped.
<br><br>
"Crap"
<br><br>
I looked down at the pager to discover it was in fact a work number, and I called the data center.  The data center advised me that one of our WAN links must be down because one of my customers could not get his application to connect to his business partner's server.  So I checked the router, and as I would have guessed, everything was fine.  I then had to call the customer and convince them it's a server/client issue and there was nothing I could do for them.  The WORST part about being in networking; customer interaction.  [<em>Grumble</em>]
<br><br>
This took over an hour and forty minutes to get resolved.  
<br><br>
I then turned my attention back to the "Game Machine" and continued my indulgence.  
<br><br>
The phone rang.
<br><br>
"Hello?"
<br><br>
"Yes sir.  Is Mr. Razor there?"
<br><br>
Only two people ask for me by MR, followed by my last name; a salesman or my doctor.  He didn't sound like my doctor.
<br><br>
"What the hell you selling pal?" I said rudely.
<br><br>
"Sir I'm not selling anything.  Is Mr. Razor there?" he repeated.
<br><br>
"This is Razor.  What can I do for you?"
<br><br>
"We would like to give.." <em>This guy was full of S**T and I could already smell it</em>. "..you the opportunity to claim this prize you have won.  It could value up to one million dollars.  How do you feel about that?  Are you interested? Do you like to win money?"  He sounded confident, like a true salesman.
<br><br>
I have learned that if you actually think you are going to win something when you take these types of calls you're a bigger idiot than the guy on the phone with me right then thinking I was going to fall for his sales pitch.  No matter how good it sounds its always going to end up someone selling you something.
<br><br>
"Look buddy.  Don't call me again.  I'm not interested in any crap you have to sell.  And take me off that list or I'll call my attorney!"  I said and slammed down the phone.
<br><br>
That usually keeps them from calling you back, and it's a great way to let off a little stress of your own.  
<br><br>
I turned my attention back to my game. 
<br><br>
A few minutes later the phone rang again.
<br><br>
"What!" I answered the phone.
<br><br>
"Sheeez a voice says on the other end.  A nice hello to you too."  A female voice said.
<br><br>
It was my wife.  I'd know her voice anywhere.  
<br><br>
She gave me a list of twenty things to do around the house so she wouldn't have to do them on her day off the next day.  
<br><br>
"Gee thanks honey.  I'm not busy at all.  I would love to do that for you." I said between my teeth.
<br><br>
More private talk.   I can't tell you guys everything!
<br><br>
I hung up the phone.  
<br><br>
AGAIN I turned my attention to the game computer.
<br><br>
The pager went off.   
<br><br>
The data center advised me that one of my customers needed to talk to me about upgrades to their network.  It was a conference call.  Oh man.  That could take up to two hours!  
<br><br>
By the end of the call it was already three o'clock.  The kids started arriving back from school.   The TV volume went up.  Stereos could be heard blasting in the bedrooms and the phone stuck to someone's ear.   My stress levels hit the ceiling.  All the gaming I had planned to do today and the peace and quiet I was suppose to enjoy never happened.  
<br><br>
The day is over.  
<br><br>
I think I'm going to rename my "Work from home" day to something more appropriate.  Should be more like "Work from Hell" day.
