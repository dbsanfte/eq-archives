Well last week, assuming anyone reads my editorials anyway, I promised a rant.  But I am writing this while I am in the middle of a Vampire game.  I’m having a blast.  And during the week I was happily entertained by a fantastic tale woven by postaholics anonymous in the Avault newsgroup.  I do not hurt anywhere, and my job has not upset me too much.
<br><br>
All in all a pretty good week.  So no ranting.  Sorry.
<br><br>
I want to encourage you writers out there to send in your stories.  We STILL can’t talk about the actual game.  We have beat all the dead horses.  But tales can inspire us and tide us over like a farewell kiss from a lover.

<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
