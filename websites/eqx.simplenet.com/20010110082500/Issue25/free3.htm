My son, knowing what I was about to do, was having trouble keeping a straight
face, so I shove him in the direction of  "Parts" to get his memory.  The
clerk motions me to a line of computers.  Each computer has fancy screen
savers with fancy twirling logos.  Which of course are all password protected
so you have to ask for a salesperson (and also fun to hack, and change the
configurations around.. but that's another article).

computer with one hundred and twenty-eight megabytes of RAM, four gigabyte
hard drive, thirty-two speed CDROM, tape backup," he says with a snaky
salesman grin.  
<br><br>
"Umm.  Is that fast?"

He looks at me for a second, as if something inside of his head clicked.  I think I could almost read his mind.  
<br><br>
<em>Oh this is a sucker.</em>
<br><br>
"This is the fastest computer on the market.  Only I'm afraid this might be too much speed for you.  Most people can't use this computer because it's just too fast."
