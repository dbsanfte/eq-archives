<b>My Confession</b>
<br><br>
It has come to my attention that some of you think I might be stretching the truth, or even lying about things I write about.  Well I am ashamed of you for even thinking this way about me [<em>gasp</em>].  Remember Razor is your friend, and would never, ever lie or bend the truth.   
<br><br>
<b>To my Astonishment</b>
<br><br>
I can't believe I have been around this long without a release of a game.  I have never been so involved with a pre-beta, prerelease of a game in my life.  It's almost been a year now.  Now I know some of you are saying you have been here longer than that, but I'm just saying a year is a long time for me.  I mean when Ultima Online was released I didn't even play it for three months, and yet here I set at about the year mark and I'm still writing, talking, and watering at the mouth over EverQuest.  All I can say is it better be good or I'm gonna go postal!
<br><br>
<b>My New Games</b>
<br><br>
I bought a new game Friday.  Its called "<em>Death Trap Dungeon</em>".  The same company that made "<em>Tomb Raider</em>" created this game.  Although I never liked the camera angles they use, the game is not bad.  I get annoyed with that interface and have to stop for a few days before I can play again.   They took some of the sword slashing from "<em>Die By The Sword</em>", and implemented it into the game.  I'm like on the second map. It's not the greatest 3dfx graphics I've seen, but there're pretty damn good.  These little blue dudes that throw knifes at you stick in your legs and arms until you heal.  It's really cool.  You also get the arms, legs and head severs which are fun to watch.
<br><br>
I also bought the game "<em>M1 Tank Platoon</em>".  Now if you're into military equipment and platoon warfare you're going to love this game.  It supports 3dfx, making the graphics very realistic.  The interface is the best I have ever seen, and very east to use.  Actually using the mouse in the cockpit can access most of the switches.  No more annoying keyboard overlays with this game.   I was in the military for five years, and have been inside an M1 Tank during operation.  I can tell you it's the closest tank simulation I've seen that compares to the real thing.  All your missing is the ringing of your ears when the main gun goes off, the smell of hot casings, and the compression of your chest from the blast.
<br><br>
My Son bought "<em>Final Fantasy Seven</em>", which was also done in 3dfx.  The graphics during the fight scenes are cool but the rest of the graphics sucked as far as I was concerned.  You spend most of your time clicking the continue button to see the next character speak while watching very boring, uninteresting cut scenes.  Don't waste your money on this one.
<br><br>
I'm happy to report I'm still playing Unreal.  I'm stuck on this new level.  It's like a city in the clouds and there are these tombstones everywhere down under the ground.  I'm not sure what I still need to do to move on.

<b>My Vacation Wrap-up</b>
<br><br>
Some of you might have read my Vacation story a few issues ago.   Man did I have a blast.  It was the greatest time I have ever had in my life!  [<em>Looks around to see if wife is looking</em>]  That was the worst trip of my entire life!  I spent the mornings feeding pigs, and my afternoons speaking redneckeese.  I couldn't wait to get home.  It is amazing what people can live without, and be so happy not having it.
<br><br>
Here are some of my minor accomplishments.
<br><br>
1. I learned how to feed pigs<br>
2. I know how boring geriatric bingo can be.<br>
3. I got my aunt kicked off her ISP.  It would seem they used some type of auto kick on their Radius server, which would kick you offline for inactivity.  This annoyed me since they advertise on their web site 24/7 Internet access, so I installed  "Ping Thingy" to prevent the disconnection from happening.  Well not twenty-four hours later they called her on the phone advising her she was staying on too long, and thus taking away online time from other users.  When she hung up I called them back and commenced to bring this ISP up to the 1990's.  I advised them that they advertise 24/7 access to the Internet, and by GOD we are going to get it! I also informed them maybe it was time to upgrade the huge T1 connection they currently had, and a few other choice words that I won't repeat here.    Well we found out the next time she logged on her account had been deleted.  I guess they were not too amused with my lecture about modern day remote access networking.  <br>
4. I now know what mountain oysters are, and what they aren't!<br>
5. I know where to find the Sci-fi Channel in Mayberry Pennsylvania.<br>
6. I know how fast my Camry can get me the hell out of Pennsylvania.<br>
7. Ohio State will defiantly crush Penn State this year in College football! [<em>ok I've always known that</em>]<br>
8. There are no such things as Snipes, thus there is no such thing as Snipe hunting.  Don't ask.<br>
9. Omish people should buy cars.  [<em>Just kidding!</em>]<br>
10. Next year we are going on a Cruise!

<b>My wife has finished Basic Geek Training</b>
<br><br>
Just to follow up one of my article "<a href="../issue 20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife</a>" I am happy to report mine has graduated.  She still has problems understanding how I can live on a keyboard, and talk to a screen, but she is spending at least two hours a day online now.  I have her ICQ'ing with her family, which I have spent the last year getting them online, one by one.  <em>Oh that reminds me.  Never tell your family you can work on computers.  You will find yourself Mr. Technical support for the rest of your life. If you're asked to work on someone's computer, play stupid.  The only person your allowed to tell you work on computers is your Mother, because she reads this magazine and you love her very much.</em>    My wife finished "<em>Die By the Sword</em>" and is now about one hundred hours into "<em>Might & Magic VI</em>".  I'm very proud of her.  Now I just need to talk her into buying her own computer so I can get her the hell off mine!  <em>Some of you that have my ICQ number might have noticed I seem to be stuck upstairs on my laptop lately.  Well there is your explanation for that.</em>
<br><br>
Well that's about all that's going on right now.  Just wanted to take some time to follow-up on a few of my articles from the past.  I enjoy putting them down in writing for you, and believe me, there are many more where those came from.  I thank you for time every week, and I really love reading all your mail.   It makes this job/hobby all worth while.  That's the greatest part about writing for EQX, it has some great fans!   Please stop again next week.
