Okay Absessies.  I have a rant!  And it's your fault because you brought
it up in the EQ forums. <<g>g>  In case you want to do something with this letter, I'll try real hard to stay on topic.
<br><br>
It seems as commerical release draws near, more and more people are becomming concerned with Rping or lack of in EverQuest.  I find this real interesting because since I have started reading the Avault EverQuest NG, it seems to me that RPing on a general basis has increased, not decreased.
<br><br>
True I am not in beta yet, however my experience has been that depending on how well you RP, or how fun you make it, you can strongly influence those around you.  Many people I never, ever dreamed would RP in anyway, have surprised the heck out of me and gone off on wild tangents.  I'll never forget Connor; power gamer to the bone, largest crit at that time in the game, that can say 3 paragraphs in one word, suddenly on a RP furry in front of everyone.
<br><br>
He used to show my good friend Zodiac around teaching her about the game we were playing because he was bored.  He choose her because she made him laugh, heck she makes everyone laugh, but he never RPed back with her.
<br><br>
Zodiac got frustrated with the game one day and was looking for something to
Thwap the on-line Head of Sysop's and "I'll pass it along" statements, Gimli
(we call him Gimmy) with.
<br><br>
Suddenly out of the blue, Connor goes into this mad furry of sawing, glue, hammering, jack hammer, stapling, tear hairs out of someone's head, to finally present Zod with a "Gimmy Dolly".  Which she promptly Thwaps the heck out of Gimmy with.
<br><br>
I thought that was the last to be seen of Connor's "frolick" with RP. But NO!  The next night the game was completely down, we are all sitting in the pub, Gimmy goes into one of his great vague speeches that we all know and love, and Connor goes into RP again!
<br><br>
He proceeds to barb zerk and detroy Zod's Gimmy doll, tacking the head to the wall on one side, the body on another wall, and playing darts with any new joiners to the table. 
<br><br>
From then on, unless we were in a deadly serious fight, he'd RP right back with us.  True it wasn't the constant that Zod and I do.  <We'll throw dead bodies at each other during fights if it won't cause the fight to go south, or throw shields at each other playing Frisbee.>  But then again Connor never was a yacker like we are anyway.
<br><br>
Honestly, RP IMO is merely another aspect of the game.  If you do it well, it will be like anything else in game that's done right such as healing at the right time, leading a lair hunt, figuring out a quest, etc., other's will begin to do it to.

[<em>Ed:  Those that know me, know that I like Onnie very much.  Not only is
she funny as hell, but she's got a good sense of what needs sayin'.  I hope
that each of us that claims to be a role-player will keep this little tale in
mind.  The best way to teach role-playing is to just do it, and have fun.
Thanks Onnie.  Now put away the gauntlets...  please...</em>]

Hi Absor.
<br><br>
Just read your editorial on EQX. As allways I enjoy reading youre mag..I don't agree on your editorial though, I'll try to explain why.  I admit that I was VERY frustrated and angry when i read my phase 4 invitation. I snipped it in here:

 Dear EverQuest Beta 4 Applicant:
<br><br>

The day has finally arrived -- it's time to sign up for the fourth phase of the EverQuest Beta Test.    We appreciate your patience as we've worked hard to get the game ready for this monumental event.   Phase 4 will begin on February 10th,1999 and will be the final testing phase prior to commercial release.  To receive your phase 4 CD in the mail, you will need to sign up for the beta at the following site: www.station.sony.com/everquest/beta
<br><br>
A valid credit card is required at sign up, and a fee of US$4.95 will be charged to your account to cover shipping and handling costs.  Also, this page will ask you for a unique authorization code (appended to the bottom of this email).  Unfortunately, due to timing constraints, this offer is only available to residents of the United States and Canada.
<br><br>
Please be aware that we aren't able to control exactly when you will get your CD. This could affect how long you will be playing. Also, realize this is a BETA, which means the game will have bugs and unforeseen problems (which is the whole point of conducting this test!). The purpose is to identify and fix problems before EverQuest is released.
<br><br>
Lastly, we make no guarantees that it will work with your system configuration.
<br><br>
All of us on the EverQuest development team look forward to seeing you in-game,
<br><br>
EverQuest Team<br>

I can tell you I was boiling and had to let out some steam, the only place I knew that people would understand. I mean I had followed EQ actively on forum.everquest and elsewhere since August 97. In the belief that I would be able to help test the game eventually.  I know that things happen during beta which change the rules. Still IMO there are no real reasons for excluding oversees testers.  Things changed for the better though. As always 989 surprised me with their VERY fast reaction and stated that there was no problems in having the CD sent to a US friend and then on from there (that's what I'm doing). That and their follow up excuse mail (the one in your ed.) gave me my faith in 989 back.
<br><br>
What I'm trying to say here is that I was one of the many who kinda exploded when I got my first p4 mail and I understand why everyone else who didn't live in US/Canada did the same. As you may have noticed, it calmed very fast when 989 sent the second mail. So I think your Ed is way off because in my opinion it was okay to get disappointed and be a bit vocal about it. As to the bitching about payment method, I don't understand that. No one have ever promised anything here, as they did when they said that everyone who filled out an app. would get the chance to beta test.
<br><br>
All in all I think your ed. is too harsh, sure people exploded, who wouldn't have done that when the only facts available was "Sorry you live in the wrong country, we don't need you, even though we promised you a spot in the beta"
<br><br>

[<em>Ed: This is the week of the long letters...  :0)  I an pleased that 989/RedEye reacted as they did to the uproar.  And I am glad you'll be in phase 4.  But I can't take back what I said.  I just wish that folks would calm down a bit before they post.  We all know that 989 got a ton of mail the very second that e-mail went out.  I guess I expect people to hang on to their anger for at least a few days before spamming MY newsgroup...  *shrugs*</em>]

Is it me or rivervale isn't there in this weak wall paper by <a href="../credits/archart.htm">Archanalia</a>. 
<br><br>
PS: was it nececary to write everquest express all the way across? 
<br><br>
Beside those points, great drawing !

Yep, Rivervale was indeed left off. A tiny oversight (pun intended). The Everquest Express was splashed across there mostly because while I enjoy the idea that people would put the picture up on their computers for personal use, I'm not a big fan of having my work pirated for another site (as I've seen someone do with another map). 
<br><br>
I'll consider posting the corrected/EQXless map at a later time.
