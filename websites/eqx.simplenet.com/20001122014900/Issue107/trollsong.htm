Come listen to a story 'bout a bar-shin' troll,<br>
From the swamp and to the city,<br>
Barshin' away at all the gnolls,<br>
One day he was afightin' and alookin' for some food,<br>
And out from the shadows came a dark elven dude.<br>
(Necromancer that is.  Lean mean undead summoning machine.)
<br><br>
The elf said, "Hey watcha think yer doin' here,<br>
"You're a troll, this is mad, don't ya even have no fear,<br>
"Them guards is gonna get ya, you wont have no place to run,<br>
"So get back to Grobb, that's where yer killin' should be done."<br>
(Good killin' that is.  All kinds of evil stuff to barsh.)
<br><br>
The troll set out for Grobb, but was stopped by a guard,<br>
Who saw the troll scratchin' his backside like a dumb retard,<br>
His faction wasn't too bad but it didn't really shine,<br>
So he said, "You've ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin mine."<br>
(Good lands that is.  Ain't no swamps out in them parts.)
<br><br>
The troll tried to kill 'im but he didn't stand a chance,<br>
He had to stop slashin' 'cause of the itchin' is his pants,<br>
He looked for the dark elf but the guy was long gone,<br>
So he turned full around and headed for the zone.<br>
(Safety that is.  Guards won't chase you through them.)
<br><br>
Well he finally saw more trolls near his native habitat,<br>
Who said, "We no see you in long time, where you been barshin' at?"<br>
He told them, "Me not know," and headed into Grobb,<br>
A little older, a little wiser, still a butt itchin' slob.<br>
(Troll that is.  Stupidest creatures ever to come out of Norrath.)
