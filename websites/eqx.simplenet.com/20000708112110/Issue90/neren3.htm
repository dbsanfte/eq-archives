<b>Part 3</b>
<br><br>


	Neren found the art of magic very interesting.  Casting spells became more of a hobby than a necessity.  He reached the rank of four with Duror.  Gilerrin managed to buy a Minotaur Axe and reach fifth rank.  Neren noticed that reaching higher ranks took many more kills than the previous rank to complete.  He also noticed that others kept saying "experience."  Experience, it appeared, was needed to level, or reach a new rank.  Each kill, depending on how hard it was gave experience.
<br><br>
	Neren didn't think about Renidyen much now; it all seemed so long ago although only less than a week had passed.  The activity around Kelethin filled his day but not his life - pass a letter to this person, get another letter, help someone lift this, help another lift that, etc.  His actual life began as he hunted in the forest, away from Kelethin, the great city of the great Wood Elves, of great deals and sales, of great security, and of running great boring errands.
<br><br>
	He bought the fifth rank druid spells early, not wanting to go all the way to the druid guildhouse again.  His preparation came to no use, since he needed to return to practice his skills again anyway when he did level.
<br><br>
	Neren had always wondered why many of his friends and he had started their training so early in their life.  It was traditional for Wood Elves to begin training when they were eighteen.  Llienna had also been taught early.  Furthermore, it was quite a coincidence that Duror, Neren, and Gilerrin had started their training the same day <em>and</em> that they heard the news of D'Vinn's death and the inevitable assault on Kelethin, his home and birthplace!  In addition, Heartwood had sent them to hunt that day at the Ruins.  <em>For what?  Did Tunare tell him to do that?  Did someone summon me or something?  Why so soon?  Why?  By Tunare!  Tell me!</em> thought Neren.  It was too much of a coincidence; Neren knew Tunare was caring for him.  <em>And D'Vinn…</em>  Neren suddenly felt dizzy.  He climbed a tree to get rid of the thought.
<br><br>
	Buckets of water became a common site around the platforms.  They cluttered the little houses of Kelethin and made the city seem invulnerable to fire.  One day Duror tripped over one and fell off Kelethin to his death.  Neren laughed as Duror reappeared over his bind point half an hour later.  Duror looted his own corpse and returned to the lifts in embarrassment and anger.
<br><br>
	Because of the obvious danger around Faydwer several nearby merchants, including many from Ak'Anon, were forced to abandon their schedules and return - or depart - to Kelethin.  Prices all around were lowered due to the competition.  Most Kelethin inhabitants expressed a sense of confidence.  The merchants seemed to also share this attitude, since they were keeping up and even improving Kelethin's famed economy.
<br><br>
	Many Elves gated back their homelands, including a Human who was born at Kelethin.  They arrived burdened with goods they have obtained in their travel.
<br><br>
	A week passed and Neren reached sixth rank while Duror and Gilerrin leveled to seventh.  Neren was frustrated by the druids' ethos.  If the rangers were also followers of Tunare, why did the druids want to destroy all edged weapons except for scimitars?  A staff no matter how powerful it is cannot match the efficiency of swords.  Once he reached seventh rank, he did the forbidden: he discarded his staff and withdrew his grandfather's magical silver war axe.  Heartwood almost expelled him after a long talk, but due the need of fighters for the defense of Kelethin and his respect for Neren's father, he let him go, much to the dismay of several druid leaders.  The people of Surefall Glades discovered his "treachery" from communicating with the Heartwood Master through a Druid who gated to Qeynos.  However, Tunare didn't seem to mind.  Several druids expected a bolt of lightning to strike Neren down, but nothing happened that day.  Eventually they came to accept Neren again.  In fact, to the horror of several, many decided to use "non-druid" weapons.  The elders looked down on Neren, puzzled at how such a young Elf could "control" others.
<br><br>
	All Neren said when he was summoned to the Kelethin Council was that it wasn't he, it was Tunare.  He explained if Tunare had struck him down, the ethos for druids were correct, so it's either that Tunare didn't see him as much of a threat or that the druid's ethos were incorrect.  Now, since a handful of druids were wielding swords and axes, it was becoming more obvious that the latter was true.  The council was surprised at the audacity of Neren's short speech although Llienna was proud.  It was becoming more and more obvious that she was sympathetic for Neren, since he was an orphan although he didn't consider himself as one.  In the past, she would always pay the rent at the inn where Neren lived.  Of course Neren tried to say he could handle his own troubles, but she insisted.  Once Duror had joked to Neren about being Llienna's pet.  Neren had only smiled, which confused Duror.  Neren loved manipulating his friends into confusion, especially foolish Duror.
<br><br>
	Gilerrin was also brought to the council.  Near the end he remarked that no matter versatility of druids, rangers would always be gifted with the natural strength and agility by Tunare to protect them.  He didn't say anything to Neren after the meeting.
<br><br>
	Neren bought a Runed oak bow and Giant Snakespine belt from a druid returning from the dangerous but beautiful plains, the Karanas.  He sold his fine steel staff to someone for ten platinum.  He gave Gilerrin a Dwarven axe after saving his life once.  Since Gilerrin wasn't used to dual wielding, he put his Minotaur battleaxe in his bank account.  Curious, he managed to persuade Williaen, the banker, to look at Neren's account.  He was astonished to see arrays of backpacks filled with ancient armor, weapons, and thousands of platinum.  He wondered why Heartwood had withdrawn a staff instead of a sword for him when they were beginning there training.  He said thanks and was about to leave when he saw Neren looking him.  After quickly apologizing and making an excuse he rushed out.  Neren checked his account.
<br><br>
	Afterwards, he explained to Gilerrin and his other friends that all that armor and weaponry was that of his father, mother, grandfather, etc.  They asked Neren why he hadn't told them this before.  Neren replied that they hadn't asked and shrugged with a playful smile.  His friends asked why he wasn't using all his money.  Neren frowned at them and asked them why he should buy something when there's none available or if he already has that something.
<br><br>
	Neren didn't see Ailaden much, but he managed to have him make an enchanted golden black pearl choker for him.  Neren paid him a couple hundred platinum coins.  Once he wore the necklace, he instantly felt more free - he discovered his ability to jump, dodge, and run better and faster.  He could also concentrate much better and hit targets more accurately with his bow.  He found a merchant returning from a place called Guk, selling Serpentine bracers.  Neren bought two pairs and gave one of the pairs to Gilerrin.  Gilerrin, of course, was speechless.
<br><br>
	He paid a fellow druid some platinum to find an enchanter that could make platinum rings.  The druid returned with a Human enchanter and Neren gave the Human two black pearls and platinum bars.  The enchanter was surprised to see the pearls and asked Neren where he found these.  Neren replied that his father had collected them for him.  The Human asked where his father was and Neren said for him just to make two platinum rings.  Neren paid him a thousand and half platinum.
<br><br>
	Neren tried to put on some chainmail armor and found it extremely heavy and uncomfortable.  He gave it to Gilerrin.  Neren preferred wearing plain light leather.  He refused to wear helmets and protective masks saying they were uncomfortable; he gave them and two platinum jasper rings that increased "wisdom" to Duror.  Wisdom was the powerhouse behind the amount of mana a priest class has, including druids, the resistance a person has to charm spells, and naturally, how wise that person was; although Neren noticed little difference in Duror.  Duror thought the mask looked foolish on him and he sold it to a passing merchant.  The next day, Neren thought he heard Duror say something about a rich bastard.
<br><br>
	It was the beginning of the second week that the first sightings of the Teir'Dal army were reported by the ranger outpost in Lesser Faydark.  They were advancing not from Dagnor's Cauldron but from the House of Unrest itself.  Heartwood explained that they must have gated here.  <em>I thought gates were "self-only" transport spells.</em>  Heartwood said that there were "portals" and "circles" which were "group gates."  It was a far more advanced form of the teleportation line of spells and the mana required to cast it was far beyond Neren's power.
<br><br>
	Neren noticed how the Gnomish technical talk was becoming the fashion of language in Kelethin, especially the Heartwood Master who loved to convey information in the easiest way possible.
<br><br>
	By then, both Neren and Duror reached the rank of six while Gilerrin wore the seventh rank badge of rangers.  Neren and Duror eagerly tried to level as fast as they could to ninth rank where Tunare would teach them how to read and understand the new spells of that rank.  Gilerrin also looked forward to donning a ninth rank badge because he was anxious to learn how to channel his natural mana into spells.
<br><br>
	Llienna came to Neren that day to present Neren a gift.  She apologized for giving it two weeks late and said that the war effort had hindered her progress on it.  Neren opened the present and found an enchanted tunic, leggings, and a pair gloves.  He asked her what it was for.  Llienna said that it was a gift, not from her, but a gift from the Kelethin council.  Neren was puzzled at first.  Llienna explained that twelve years and two weeks ago right when the sun reached the highest tree, Neren's father had won his greatest military victory at Kelethin.  Neren asked where the boots were.  Llienna was surprised at his question.  Neren smiled and said he was just joking.
<br><br>
	It seemed that the in the next few days, with the help of magic, the Dark Elves would reach Kelethin.  When they did, perhaps victory, truth and happiness would eventually rule all, or perhaps the darkest depths of despair would cloud Norrath.
<br><br>
	"Don't worry about me," Duror said to Llienna.  "Wait - don't -"
<br><br>
	Llienna kissed him on his head lightly.  "Don't get killed."
<br><br>
	Duror's face flushed in embarrassment.
<br><br>
	"Is it worse than falling off Kelethin?"  Gilerrin joked.  Duror glared at him.  Neren just grinned.
<br><br>
	"Come.  I hear that Lord Mistmoore has been spotted leading an army of Dark Elves from his castle.  The rest of the Teir'Dal should be arriving soon enough," Heartwood said.
<br><br>
	Duror's cheeks grew redder as he realized Heartwood had been watching.  The trio of friends followed Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"Hey, it's Tinky," whispered Gilerrin.  Neren and Duror followed his finger.
<br><br>
	Tinky was a small female Wood Elf about two years younger than Neren who was obsessed with Gnomish technologies.  She earned her name from Neren's mother and she seemed to like it.  At present, she was running past them and carrying backpacks obviously full of servos and gears.  It appeared she was having trouble and was dropping several pieces of equipment when another female Wood Elf around Neren's age helped lighten her load.
<br><br>
	Heartwood also noticed them.  "Ah.  Good old devoted Kristania helping little Chrysia.  Come on, no sightseeing, Duror."
<br><br>
	The girls heard him and laughed at Duror, who smiled timidly, embarrassed.
<br><br>
	"Still any worse than falling?" whispered Gilerrin.  Duror poked him.
<br><br>
	Suddenly a huge hulking figure filled Neren's sight.  Instinctively, he ran and tried to hide somewhere near that was safe in Kelethin.  Gilerrin found him.  "It was just a Barbarian - you know one of those big Humans.  Come on, get up."
<br><br>
	Neren followed the rest, keeping a lookout for this "Barbarian."  They arrived at the "Orc lift," a commonly used lift that lead to the Orc camps where several Orcish "guards" were patrolling.  Neren hunted these guards often and noticed other people calling them centurions and oracles.  The guards were useless to the Orcish race now, since their life spans were less than two minutes long; crowds of Elves were ready to pounce on them.  Neren learned that several hapless Orc pawns were bound to the Orc camps and continuously spawned there.  It was a good place to hunt for many ranks.
<br><br>
	"Okay, this is the Orc lift," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	Neren, Gilerrin, and Duror looked at Heartwood in surprise.  "What?…" said Duror, "Umm… how can we not know this place - we've been here all our life…"
<br><br>
	"Oh, my apologies.  For a minute I thought I was leading a group of tourists."
<br><br>
	Last month, Heartwood, much to his annoyance, was randomly selected by the Kelethin council to be one of the many Kelethin guides.  The Heartwood Master gave one of his rare foolish smiles.
<br><br>
	A shadow was cast upon Neren.  Something swooshed over him.  Neren looked up and saw Dill Fireshine levitating above them, inspecting the many defensive structures on the platform.  Catapults and ballistas were out of the question because they were extremely cumbersome and heavy.  The projectiles they launch will only skim the tops of trees and land somewhere very distant, even when downgraded.  Nevertheless, Elvenkind had found other useful defenses: pots of boiling water and rocks, crossbow mounts, earthen fortifications, trenches, traps and pits, wooden parapets…  The platforms were currently being soaked by water summoned by the druids.  Magic users were casting spells protecting Kelethin's wood from fire, cold, and rot.  The trunks of the trees that were supporting Kelethin were being strengthened by a crisscross pattern of enchanted steel, developed by the Dwarves and enchanters of Faydwer.
<br><br>
	The druids and rangers of Tunare called upon nature to help them.  Tunare responded by strengthening the forest.  She called the animals to Kelethin for safety.  She also granted the leaders of Kelethin the ability to communicate with Surefall Glades and the druids at Rivervale through Tunare's plane.  Obviously, she had managed to neglect her fears of Innoruuk's unavoidable intervention, seeing Kelethin and the land more important than her own soul.
<br><br>
	A few minutes later, several Human and Halfling druids and rangers gated to Kelethin to protect the sacred trees.
<br><br>
	Neren was among the party that greeted the newcomers.  He noticed, along with many others, that Te'Anara, disproved of his axes.  <em>Te'Anara!</em>  The druid leader of Surefall Glades!  Heartwood had told Neren that she would be leading a party of rangers and druids into Greater Faydark, but it was just amazing to see the Human druid.  Neren uncomfortably adjusted his belt under Te'Anara's stare and heard his two axes clang against each other.  He smiled sheepishly.
<br><br>
	Heartwood greeted her in the formal custom of Tunare.  Suddenly, Neren's instincts flared as Heartwood invoked a spell of divination that quickly let Te'Anara learn of the details of recent events.  Neren slowly backed away.  Several other Elves, both Wood Elf and High Elf, began to feel uncomfortable.
<br><br>
	A Dwarven cleric, noticed the tension within the Elves and cast a spell called "See Invisible" on Te'Anara and Heartwood.  By communicating with Tunare, Te'Anara and Heartwood pinpointed the danger to the others.  It was a hidden Dark Elf rogue.  Still facing away from the Dark Elf, they waited for Heartwood to secretly cast the spell.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, there was a bright flash of light and clap of thunder, and only a Dark Elf corpse remained after the magical sparks settled.
<br><br>
	"A scout," said Te'Anara.  "He must have thought he could hide from us - what a fool."
<br><br>
	Fireshine, who had heard the thunder, floated down from the platform that led to the Orc lift.  He saw the corpse.  "Ah, the enemy has arrived.  The time has come at last.  Strike the foe down well, Tunare."
<br><br>
	Although Dill was usually a peace-loving individual, he sometimes lusted for battle - a battle in which he could help destroy evil.  That was a rare trait among Wood Elves, but common in good Humans.
<br><br>
	Neren unhooked his magical axes, climbed a tree with the aid of them, and swung on to the Kelethin platform, agitated.  Unexpectedly, a woman screamed.  The sobbing voice came from somewhere near the Rogue Guild.
<br><br>
	"It's Blossom," said Heartwood.  Neren hadn't heard him approach.  "The ranger that went to Neriak."
<br><br>
	Curiosity overwhelmed Neren.  Neren should have been able to control it, but something bothered him, compelled him.  If this compulsion was evil, he didn't care; he just wanted to see her.  He, along with many other young Elves, immediately went to see her.  Neren arrived third, taking a shortcut, and broke through a gathering crowd to enter the house where the voice was coming from.  An elderly Wood Elf lady was tending to a crying and shouting Human sitting on a bed, obviously Blossom.
<br><br>
	Blossom caught sight of Neren and relaxed.  She stared at him through watery eyes.  "I love you."
<br><br>
	Neren jumped.  But before he could say anything, Blossom eyes turned red, and she jumped on Neren.  The only thing Neren could say was "Hey!" before she was upon him.  Neren was strong for his age and race, but a full-grown Human was too much for him.  Blossom rammed him into the wall.  Neren released his axes in pain and prepared to retaliate, but Blossom hit him again, this time in the stomach.  He fell, hit by a blow on his cheek.  Instinctively he closed his eyes and felt his body hammered by punches and his face was being scratched.  He clenched his eyes, knowing that she was trying to get to his eyes.
<br><br>
	Then it was over.  He heard a feminine gasp and felt Blossom's body pulled off of him.  It all happened in a few seconds.
<br><br>
	"Are you alright?"  It was Heartwood.  Neren opened his eyes and let Heartwood help pull him up.
<br><br>
	He surveyed the situation.  Blossom was standing near him with a mad, tearstained face, clearly trying to reach him.  However, her feet and legs were held fast by growing spiked roots.  She screamed in agony.
<br><br>
	The woman who was caring for her turned to Neren.  "Are you alright?" she repeated the question for Heartwood.
<br><br>
	"Yes."  Neren examined himself and felt the burning cuts and numbness on much of his body.  He sighed.  "Actually, not really."
<br><br>
	Heartwood cast a strong spell to calm Blossom, but to no avail.  The strange dark magic that Neren could now sense was powerful.  He felt sorry for her, yet angry at her.  His confused feelings brought back a memory - a very faint one that he couldn't quite totally recall… <em>D'Vinn…</em>
<br><br>
	He snapped out of it and felt the healing magic Heartwood surround him.
<br><br>
	"I tried to warn you," said Heartwood.  "She was sent back to Freeport by the Dark Elves to curse them.  They put this evil magic that compels people to see her when she is heard.  She's a good person, but her mind is tainted with evil.  We have found no cure for her… yet."
<br><br>
	"How did you…?"
<br><br>
	"It only affects young people."
<br><br>
	<em>Why would the Dark Elves do that?</em>
<br><br>
	With the pain gone, he felt his instincts arouse again.  <em>Dark Elves!</em>  He recovered his weapons and fallen quivers and let the Heartwood Master lead him to the Orc lift platform.
<br><br>
	Neren had grown quite fond of Heartwood.  The druid master seemed like a father too him.  He wasn't a source of comfort, but of praise, learning, and faith.
<br><br>
	Duror was waiting for him at the platform.  "Why were you at the Scouts of Tunare?"  Clearly, Duror had not heard Blossom.
<br><br>
	"You didn't hear anything?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"I was disabling the lifts, but someone near me paused for a moment, then jumped off."
<br><br>
	"Neren, I'm sure Gilerrin and the others working at the lift could use an extra pair of hands," said Heartwood.
<br><br>
	Neren smirked at the idea of a little Elf as valuable help with about ten other adults, but he played along.  He nodded to Duror and Heartwood and jumped down onto the lift.
<br><br>
	He turned around, looked and reached up to grasp Duror's waiting hand and helped Duror down.  Together, they swung underneath the lift and began to chip away at the wooden components aiding the gears with tools they got from Heartwood.  It was dirty work, but Neren enjoyed it.  It wasn't exactly fun, but at least he had something to do besides running around and carrying backpacks full of weapons.  He glanced over at Duror who was distinctly unhappy.  Gilerrin happened to glance at Neren at the time and followed Neren's eyes to Duror, then back to Neren with a grin.  Neren noticed him and grinned back.  Then they respectively did their own work.
<br><br>
	"Away!"
<br><br>
	Neren clambered onto the lift and jumped off onto the platform with Gilerrin.  Seconds later, another Elf released a cord that was attached to the lift.
<br><br>
	The thick wooden board that once served as the lift shattered with a loud crash.  Neren almost felt a pang of grief, but he quickly chided himself over thinking about crying over an inanimate piece of wood.  <em>Well, it is magical,</em> he thought.  <em>Yes and it's just a large piece of wood,</em> his alter ego told him.  Neren hid a smile and thought this was kind of funny, although afterwards he thought it was stupid.
<br><br>
	"How are the others doing?" an older Wood Elf asked Fireshine.
<br><br>
	Fireshine answered without looking.  "Congratulations, you were the slowest group."
<br><br>
	Neren saw some of the Elves' laugh.  Gilerrin also laughed, but for a moment Neren thought Fireshine was serious; he didn't know the ranger guildmasters very well.
<br><br>
	He felt another pulse of instinctive repulsion.  More Dark Elves arrived within the Greater Faydark.  Still, it appeared the Elves would have the advantage here.  The forest was Kelethin's ally and Kelethin the forest's guardian.
<br><br>
	He heard a brief command to his right.  It was Maesyn Trueshot leading a squad of rangers across the trees.  The rangers seemed to run on the treetops, but Neren knew from conversations with Gilerrin that they were only trained to do that.  Neren tried the technique once, but fell on the first skip and ended up clinging on a branch for life.
<br><br>
	Suddenly, he heard the dreaded command.  "Attack!"
<br><br>
	But it was only Gilerrin.  He had whispered the word in Neren's ear.  He was laughing when Neren realized he was tricked.  At once he thought about shouting at Gilerrin, but it did feel nice to release some tension.  His frown turned into a smile.  Then he gradually started laughing.
<br><br>
	"I wish you would stop that," Neren said.  They were still laughing, however.
<br><br>
	"And you should be used to it," Gilerrin said merrily.
<br><br>
	After the laughter subsided, Neren turned grave and took Gilerrin's hand.  Gilerrin knew what would happen and he accepted Neren's words: "If I die and fall to the hands of the Banisher, run with Tunare and preserve my memory.  I have felt Tunare's soul within me.  Do you promise, my friend?"
<br><br>
	"If <em>I</em> die and fall to the hands of the Banisher, <em>you</em> run with Tunare and preserve <em>my</em> memory.  I have also felt her.  Do <em>you</em> promise, my friend?"
<br><br>
	They silently shook hands and looked deep into each other eyes then grinned and jiggled their thumbs in a playful manner.  It was an old game.
<br><br>
	Duror spotted Neren and Gilerrin and came over.  "Hail."
<br><br>
	Neren and Gilerrin looked at each other and laughed, remembering Duror's annoyed face when they were working.
<br><br>
	"What?" said Duror.
<br><br>
	"Nothing," said Gilerrin.
<br><br>
	"What?" Duror said, demandingly.
<br><br>
	"Never mind."
<br><br>
	Heartwood's voice rose above the others, "The Dwarves have just contacted us.  They just said they will send all their guards."
<br><br>
	"Through Tunare?" said Neren.
<br><br>
	"Yes and gifted with speed to aid their travels here.  But the sudden disappearance of the Goblins worries me…"
<br><br>
	"They must be here along with the Orcs.  I can smell the scent of death, so undead are here, too."
<br><br>
	Heartwood sniffed the air.  "You're right.  And the rangers in the Lesser Faydark came to Kelethin yesterday.  That means Mayong Mistmoore's on the move."
<br><br>
	"Incoming!" someone shouted.
<br><br>
	A small army of Orcs rushed Kelethin in vain.  Tiny holes in the platform allowed the defenders to pour water or rain arrows and rocks onto the hapless mob.
<br><br>
	Neren rushed to the edge of the platform, but was forced to retreat, temporarily blinded by a spell.
<br><br>
	The death cries of Orcs and triumphant Elven shouts filled the air.  Once, Neren thought he heard Duror shout that he killed an Orc.  <em>As if it was the first Orc you killed…</em> Neren thought sarcastically.
<br><br>
	Once Neren fully regained his sight, the battle was already over.  There were no friendly casualties and all of the Orc force was slaughtered.  It was a short clash that lasted for about three minutes.
<br><br>
	Neren wanted to rejoice for this initial victory, but he saw Heartwood's worried expression.  "What's wrong?"
<br><br>
	Heartwood glanced at him, then stared straight ahead to the forest.  "They're trying to make us overconfident.  They are expecting us to celebrate.  If we did, they would launch a surprise attack.  Ha!  That was an easy one."
<br><br>
	"Nice try!  Do you think we're that dumb?" Heartwood shouted to the forest.
<br><br>
	Neren heard some grunts of the nearby Orcs and Goblins, willing to take Heartwood's challenge.  But they were being held back by the Teir'Dal.
<br><br>
	Then he spoke a common war philosophy to Neren.  "We may have won the battle, but we haven't won the war."
<br><br>
	Greater Faydark seemed to sigh as it watched evil races continue to inhabit its trees.
