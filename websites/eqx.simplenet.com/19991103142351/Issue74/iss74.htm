   As the years passed, Kinory's father grew more intractable, and her mother more withdrawn.  The charming, free-spirited Ranger grew quiet and meek.  The only things that brought her out were the letters from Gwyn.  She and Kinory would read them late at night in Kinory's room, a mild conspiracy against Holyd, who forbade even the mention of Gwyn's name.

	Once upon a time...what an odd way to start a story.  Stories happen, sometimes more than once to more than one person or set of persons... and certainly ALL stories happen "upon a time".  Be that as it may, THIS story happened, and it happened not too very long ago as once-upon-a-time's go.  This is a love story, full of intrigue and drama, heartbreak and happiness, and is yet to be resolved.  This is the long awaited, and asked for, story of t'Ceira and Darvinn called "Wrath" and this is how it happened.

   The breeze that remained behind the thunderstorm swept the low hills of the Plains of Karana.  Wolves silently padded out of their dens as the breeze ruffled thick grey fur. Further west and away from the two-legs a bear stood and flexed powerful muscles as he too welcomed the new day. The wind swept east to where an old farmer rubbed his unshaven chin as he surveyed the flood damage to his crops. There was much work to be done if they wanted to survive the winter. The only other two people out at sunrise in the Plains slogged down the muddy road at a slow pace.

You've all seen the shouts … "So-and-so is killing newbies at the leveling area!" … "So-and-so is a pkiller!"  You, bored and filled with righteous indignation, race o'er hill and dale to said newbie area to see that yes, in fact, one or two people are going around killing newbies, and no, given the infinite genius [sic] of the PK system, you can't do anything about it.

This week I want to go over one of the most hacked topics ever.  I want to talk about the conflict that exists between hard-core roleplayers and hard-core powergamers.  More specifically I want to talk about the stereotypes that are necessary to make that whole conflict exist.  Even more specifically, I want to talk about the hard-core roleplayer stereotype.  It's funny what actually talking to a real-life stereotype can inspire in a person.

In Wynn's latest Q&A she answered the question "Is there a place I can find a full listing of pet commands? with the obligatory: in the manual- however this is apparently not completely true, as the manual only states the pet commands for magician and necromancer- playing an enchanter who animates a dagger as a pet, the pet responds to none of the typical commands, even differing syntax<b>...</b>
