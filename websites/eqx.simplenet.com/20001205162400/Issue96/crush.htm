From atop a ragged pile of skulls<br>
The Orcish King did reign<br>
The sound of armoured footfalls alerted him<br>
To an intruder to be slain
<br><br>
Swiftly did he put aside<br>
His cup of evil brew<br>
"The day you swine came to my Isle<br>
Shall be that day you'll rue."
<br><br>
He armed himself with wicked haste<br>
And donned his chainmail bright<br>
With lust and hate for Good did he<br>
Anticipate the fight
<br><br>
And then around the corner<br>
Came a figure clad in Plate<br>
"I come to slay thee Orc-Lord<br>
Prepare to meet thy fate"
<br><br>
And deep in Crush's heart awoke<br>
Unbridled hate unreasoned<br>
"I'll slay thee upstart silver elf<br>
And serve thee up well seasoned"
<br><br>
"For Tunare and the Koada' dal"<br>
Was all the Knight replied<br>
But softly drew his blade and stood<br>
The battle to decide
<br><br>
In dark and evil glory<br>
The Orc-King then did sneer<br>
"Give my regards to your Elven Bitch<br>
For soon you'll be quite near"
<br><br>
With a clash of steel they came to blows<br>
For hours they did strive<br>
Mighty wounds were dealt by each<br>
'Till one was left alive
<br><br>
Then down upon his fallen foe<br>
The wounded Knight did gaze<br>
And slowly home he made his way<br>
Though wounded for many days.
<br><br>
Yet despite his valiant struggle<br>
And his prowess on the field<br>
By blessings of the darker sort<br>
The Orc-King did not yield
<br><br>
Then did Crush's hell-spawned master<br>
Refuse to end the strife<br>
And thus by dark communion<br>
Returned his flesh to life
<br><br>
And so sits the Orcish Monster still<br>
Upon his carved plush throne<br>
And slays all those who intrude within<br>
His Kingdom of Crushbone
