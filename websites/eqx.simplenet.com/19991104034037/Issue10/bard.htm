	<big><big>I</big></big>t is not often when my life is turned upside down, and I am forced to question all my beliefs.  But there are times when a mirror is brought before you, and it’s harsh light reveals the transparency of the illusions we hold.
<br><br>
	I am a bard by trade.  It is my task to instruct, through stories, fables and songs, what is important to us and our people.  Part of this is to teach our youngers what is the meaning of concepts we hold dear,  concepts like goodness, humility, honor, and courage.  It is these tales, when told well, that give us courage when we must go to war and act with honor in our combats.  "Honor is it’s own reward."  "Courage is facing your fears and overcoming them."  These are the morals of the stories that I tell.  The tales aren’t the same as the real thing.
<br><br>
I was privileged to have met a young human named Arthedain in the course of my travels.  He, like many other children, listened to my tales by the fireside while growing up, and unlike most children, chose the way of the warrior.  "Oghma," he said, "I want to be a knight, questing to help others.  I want Norrath to be safe for the young and the helpless."  Whenever I came Rivervale, he would come and visit with me at this Inn, the Rose and Sword.  He would tell me of his exercises, his training, his life and where he thought it was going.  All this time, he never took the easy, less generous way.  His choices were so often for the good, it almost appeared false, like he was doing it for an audience.  Once, when a friend of his had betrayed him with the girl he loved, he forgave them both, saying, "We all needed to learn what cost our choices have.  Belnath needed to learn that betrayal scars the soul, Judith needed to learn that I am not the one for her, and I needed to learn the nature of trust and love."

I almost laughed at him then, he was so serious.  Who would believe someone to have such a generous soul?  I prided myself that I, and my stories, had been the lamp which guided his path.
<br><br>
	Arthedain had a close friend who, too, wanted to fight for the weak and helpless.  Arthedain and he trained together, but while Arthedain had a natural grace, his friend Amlaith did not.  What would take Arthedain a few hours to master would take Amlaith weeks.  Arthedain helped Amlaith all the time, and while Amlaith never became as good as Arthedain, he was one of the best warriors in Rivervale.  Together they journeyed, seeking food and shelter as they went, seeking to aid those in need.
<br><br>
	An Orc raid had ripped through the village of Redtree, just south of the Kithicor Woods.  Arthedain and Amlaith came to the town shortly after, and set off in pursuit of the raiding party that had burned the outlying farm houses and torn through the village itself.  Though the Orc raiding party numbered two dozen, the two young warriors thought they could catch up with the loot-laden raiders, and take them by surprise.  The trail they left was not hard to follow.
<br><br>
	The rearguard of the Orc band consist of three bored, drunken, louts who were quickly dispatched.  The noise made by the battle attracted the rest of the band, and Arthedain and Amlaith found themselves surrounded by about 20 Orcs, feeling smug from their pillaging, and in a uproarious, evil mood.  Amlaith and Arthedain fought like ones possessed, but in the end, were overcome and knocked unconscious.  They awoke, staked above a fire, drunken Orcs leering at them as if grateful for the chance at more entertainment

My two young friends, raised on tales of bravery and sacrifice, trussed up and bleeding, gone from being heroes of a tale of retribution to being an evening of entertainment for a brutal gang of Orcs.
<br><br>
	And they were.  I will not detail the things they suffered through, but they resisted with all the sprit they could muster.  In the end, Amlaith broke, screaming for mercy as they revived him from a faint for the fourth time. When the drunken brawl had ended, and the Orcs had all fallen asleep, Arthedain almost tore off his arm getting free, and staggering, stumbling, returned to the village, carrying a broken and dying Amlaith in his arms.  I had been traveling through the village and was helping the survivors re-build.  A villager told me that a young man had arrived in the village, and was being taken to the healer.
<br><br>
	I couldn’t recognize either of them.  I gave the healer some herbs and tinctures that I had gathered in my travels, hoping they might do some good.  I sat in the room as the healer worked, playing soothing songs of peace and comfort.  After the healer finished, I continued to play, wishing upon these two unknown warriors a dreamless, healing repose. After a while, I, too, rested, my chin on my harp, sitting upright in the healer’s chair by the bed.
