<b>Part Six</b>


<br><br>


   The first day of classes was a nightmare.  The trials that Pedder had given her the day before seemed like play compared to the warm up that they were expected to do.  The other students were openly contemptuous of her, and whispered loudly among themselves about favoritism.  One arrogant Dwarf told her to her face that she would never have passed the Tests, and that if the training did not kill her, the final Exam would.  By the end of the day, she was weary to the point of incoherence, sore in every muscle, and ready to weep at the next snide word or sideways look thrown her way.  Breakfast she had missed, and lunch had been a quickly snatched snack in the training grounds, but dinner was served in a large dining hall, where all the students ate together.  No one sat with her, and she picked at her food listlessly, feeling more alone than she had felt in her entire life.  When the final bell rang, she limped slowly back to her rooms, sure that she had made the worst mistake possible.
<br><br>
   She opened the door, and found Daryth sitting in her window, grinning at her.
<br><br>
   "So, how do you like being a Rogue?" he asked her.  She burst into tears.   He left his seat and drew her into the room.  He seated her on the narrow bed and put an arm around her.  "Not quite what you had imagined, is it?"  His tone, surprisingly, was gentle and understanding.  "Do you see why I didn't want you to come with me?"
<br><br>
   "You could have told me!" she wailed.  "And now I cannot leave.  Pedder told me.  Leave, and get hunted down as a traitor.  There is a price on my head as soon as I leave the Guild grounds without an escort!  I hate you!"  She threw his arm off violently.
<br><br>
  "You would not have believed me," he said calmly.  "I did not, when I first came here.  And I see strength in you, Kinory."  He lifted her chin and looked into her reddened, angry eyes.  "You are a survivor."  He smiled, and then dropped his hand and stood.  "Get some rest," he said kindly.  "Tomorrow is another day."
  <br><br>
Kinory glared at him, but he only smiled again, and left the room.  She tugged off her boot and threw it at the door.   
<br><br>
   She found that he spoke nothing but the truth.  The first week was like an eternity of torture, but after, she felt herself getting harder, stronger, more fit than she had ever been while running the forests of home.  Her dedication and fierce drive silenced many of those who had thought her weak, and although she made no friends, she won a grudging respect from her classmates.  Pedder never said anything, but she felt his pride in her, and it made her proud of herself.  She came into a quiet self-respect, and wore it like armor against the world.
<br><br>
   Daryth never visited her again, but she saw him in the halls, always sauntering with his deceptively lazy speed, always with one of his infuriating grins on his face.  He would show up at the training grounds in the middle of some test, and watch her dispassionately until she became awkward and uneasy.  Then he would leave, and suddenly, her difficulties would disappear.   Kinory never felt that way when Katha would come to watch her train.  Katha always had advice and words of support, and Kinory never felt judged, or laughed at, or...  Kinory simply couldn't work out how she felt about Daryth.  It was not love, or even hero-worship.  Daryth and Katha shared quarters, and Kinory never felt the slightest bit jealous.  It was different, more important than puppy love.  She needed, craved his approval, and she never seemed to be worthy of it.  She pushed herself harder, until even Pedder was openly impressed with her advancement.  
<br><br>
   So it was that only a year after she entered training, she was graduated to the senior class, and barely three months later, Pedder told her that her final exam had been assigned.  
<br><br>
    She went from the training grounds in a daze, barely hearing the congratulations of the other students, not seeing the glares of the jealous.  She went to her room, and leaned out the window, eyes closed, hands braced against the frame, trying to catch a hint of wind.  The air was still and sultry.  
<br><br>
   Freeport lay prostrate beneath the hottest summer in years.  Every inhabitant, from the Duke to the lowest beggar, spent their days doing as little as possible.  Kinory, used to the cool shaded climate of Faydwer, had been suffering especially.  The training outfit of light black cotton felt like the heaviest of velvet to her.  She relaxed onto the window sill and tugged off her boots, tossing them idly to the floor.
<br><br>
  The Final Exam.  It was discussed among the students in hushed voices, usually after dark.  They said that passing meant a bonus of 50 platinum.  Those who failed…Kinory had never met a failed Rogue.  Supposedly there were none to meet.
<br><br>
   "So."  She suppressed the urge to jump and turned casually to see Daryth in the doorway.  She raised one eyebrow.  "So you have been scheduled to take the Exam in a fortnight.  I'm here to warn you.  Galern has been assigned as your tester."
<br><br>
   "Warn me?" she asked, suddenly off balance.
<br><br>
   "Be on your guard, young Kinory.  He's not very nice.  Unlike me."  Daryth grinned at her and then was gone.
<br><br>
    Kinory cursed to herself and sprang to her feet.  By the time she got to the door, he was, of course, no where in sight.  Galern wasn't nice?  She knew that already.  What had the irritating man meant?
<br><br>
   Over the next two weeks, Kinory barely left the training grounds.  She worked from sunup to sundown, pushing herself harder than Pedder had ever done.  Her fellow students gave her a wide berth, as per the Rogue tradition.  She was dead, and would be so until she came back from her testing.  If she came back at all.
<br><br>
   Each night, a small black-wrapped package awaited her at her door.  A new piece of equipment rested in each of them, to replace the worn apprentice tools she used to train with.  The final night before the test, the package was larger, and soft.
<br><br>
   She took it inside and opened it on her bed.  Inside the layers of black linen, a full suit of black silk rested.  She pulled out the tunic and held it against her.  It was light, and as she moved it, the silk made no noise at all.  Light seemed to disappear within the folds, and it was lighter than spider web.
<br><br>
   "Enchanted,"  Kinory murmured to herself, delighted.  
<br><br>
   "Yes, indeed."  She looked up to see Katha at the door.
<br><br>
   "You aren't supposed to be here," said Kinory, mouth quirking.  "Is this from you?"  She held up the tunic.  Katha nodded.
<br><br>
   "Do you like it?"
<br><br>
    Kinory laughed.
<br><br>
   "How could I not?  Teron himself will be jealous!"
<br><br>
    "It is not only pretty, my dear.  It is charmed against backstab."  Katha's usually laughing eyes were grim.  
<br><br>
   "Backstab?"  said Kinory.  "What have I to fear from my fellows?"
<br><br>
   Katha looked at her for a minute, incredulous, and then shook her head.
<br><br>
   "It's time for you to grow up, Kinory.  Open your eyes.  I thought Daryth had spoken to you.  Watch your back.  You are about to start swimming with the sharks, and if you do not learn suspicion, you will never survive."  Katha stared at her as if to drive each word home, and then turned abruptly and was gone.
