It was late last night, and I was on my usual drinking spree to forget my troubles.
I had lost my true ardor because of my hunger for adventure <em>(or that blond waitress
at Drogg’s Tavern she caught me with)</em>. I sat there rotating my shot glass,
drowning in my thoughts, when two sinister looking figures entered the tavern. The
first one through the door was wearing a dark nut-brown robe.  The hood hung over
his eyes, concealing his face.  The second was dressed in bedraggled leather battle
armor, which was probably stolen off of a deceased henchman.  Their sky-blue coarse
looking skin was visible through the breaks in the garments they wore.  They
approached me cautiously, and both took a seat at the bar next to me.

"You a good fighter?"  The robed figure mumbled, as he slid his hood back far enough to see his tawny
baneful eyes.
<br><br>
"I’ve been know to be." I barked, attempting to look unconcerned with either of them.
<br><br>
"We unearthed a cavern north of here.  We adventured as far as we could today but a
colossal snake blocks our path, and we had to flee." The leathered figure says with
a sigh.

The two then depicted how they had stumbled on this underground chamber, and the fact
that it turned out to be some form of burial chamber.  They talked of coffins they
had discovered.  The sarcophaguses had been incised into the walls of huge
antechambers.  "These antechambers were everywhere."
<br><br>
"There has to be treasure in there!" they both declared.
