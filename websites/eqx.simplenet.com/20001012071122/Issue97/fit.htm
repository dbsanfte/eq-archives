<b> -- Freeport</b>
<br><br>
Hoi there all!!! Lrets D'pearl here with the latest and greatest in news across Norrath. I had another story to tell ye until this latest, literally ground breaking scoop, shook it's way into me life ... &lt;grumblegrumble ... AND left me with a face full of petrified turd that took one week to remove and half me savings to get a mage to do it!!! ... but more on that next week&gt; 
<br><br>
In any case, as many of ye may know the residents of Freeport had their bones shook in what has been called one of the strongest earthquakes in the last two years. However, with much diligence and much risk to life and limb ... EQ Express reporters were able to discover that this was no ordinary earthquake. In fact... the earthquake was caused by the drunken revelry of Sand Giants out in the Oasis of Marr and Northern Ro.  For those of ye that don't know ... this past weekend was the weekend reserved for the Festival of Water ... that is in fact a recognition of the ancient legends which tell of how the Sand Giants of the Desert of Ro came here. It is a time of great celebration and happiness where much feasting, singing and drinking occurs. In fact, this "celebration" got so out of hand ... that the Giants took to expressing their devout observance of this holiday by immersing themselves in Lake Marr... via Bellyflops from the roof of Oasis of Marr's Inn and the trees along the shore there. Residents tell of some type of competition that seems to have sprung up between the Giants to see who could make the largest bellyflop!

<em>Sand Giants show their devout observance of the Festival of Water by "immersing" themselves in the waters of Lake Marr ...</em>
<br><br>
Tremors caused by these activities are attributed to causing the majority of damage to Freeport and neighboring villages. Reports tell of a wagon train on the far side of Southern Ro that was actually knocked off it's wheels by those aftershocks. Luckily only a few people were injured and there were no fatalities ... but those of ye hoping to get their mitts on some Dwarven ale are in for a long wait. And none could express this sentiment more than the Spectres who reside on the island in Lake Marr ... "Those blasted giants woke me from a ten century slumber... and I was having the BEST dream... grrrrrr!!!, exclaimed an irate Spectre.

<em>...by bellyflopping into the waters of Lake Marr from the rooftops of local inns and trees. Local Spectres were NOT amused.</em>

<br><br>
Needless to say ... ALL the local residents in Freeport and around are thankful to their gills that this holiday is only celebrated once in ten years. 
<br><br>
Well... that's all for this week ... take care all! This is Lrets D'pearl Aspiring Bard Extraordinaire and Cub Reporter who is ready to go any length and plumb (or stoop to ... as ye'll see next week) any depth to make sure ye get the latest and greatest in news across Norrath!
