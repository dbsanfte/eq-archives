this brave sole has attempted to complete, and with the hope that all
can learn from what happened to this great warrior.
<br><br>
The Inn of the Wayward Traveler was not an exceptional inn by any
means, in fact it was really beneath his normal standards.
Unfortunately a lone traveler can not always afford better, and there
was worse.  Luckily there were no rats to be seen, and the food was
cooked satisfactory.  Indreju sat by himself in a small booth in the
corner of the inn listening to the beautiful bard that had a voice that
seemed to caress his ears like the touch of silk to skin.   She was
really the most beautiful human that he had ever seen, long dark hair
and skin that looked to be golden from just the right amount of exposure
to the sun.
<br><br>
Just when he thought of maybe approaching her to see if she new any
songs from his homeland, Faydwer, a large man who had the smell of too
much brandy approached the tall High Elf and spoke in a loud slurred
speech, "Get out of here elf!  We don't want your kind in the city!"
<br><br>
Realizing the large, bulky man was speaking more from his abundance
of alcohol that night, Indreju responded in a warm friendly voice,
"Friend, allow me to buy you a drink, and then in the morning I shall
continue my travels to the north, and leave your fine town behind me."

Instantly he realized his mistake as the man burrowed his eyebrows
and demanded, "You will leave now, or we shall gut your elven hide like
the animal you are!"  At this, a group of the drunks friends stood up
from their positions around a table near the bard, and started to bring
their hands down to the hilts of their weapons.  Weapons the innkeeper
had not required them to remove as he had Indreju when he arrived.
<br><br>
"Maybe we should just gut him anyway?  He looks like he might
actually be a fight, not like the last foolish elf we killed."  One of
the drunks friends interjected into what Indreju was considering a
dangerous situation.  And well he should, he had been required to leave
his sword outside with his war horse, and although he still wore his
chain armour, this would not stop the group of drunkards.
<br><br>
The others were starting to draw their weapons as the large man
turned to talk back to them, "A High Elf fight!  Hah!  What would they
know of fighting, unless it is to use magic and steal babies in the
night as all the other elves do."  With the large mans attention turned
away, Indreju took the opportunity to quickly run to the back of the
inn, past the startled innkeep.
<br><br>
With shouts of, "Get the elven bastard!", the drunks immediately
started to follow him through the kitchens and out the back door.  It
was still moderately light out, and the fresh autumn air was already
several degrees cooler then that of the inn.  The change helped awaken
Indreju's senses as he ran to the stables, to find his horse and try and
escape the mob of drunks.

The noise that Indreju heard from behind him enforced the need for
him to escape, as his attackers made their way clumsily through the
kitchens.  Rushing into the barn that this inn called a stable, the
rough smell of animal waste assaulted his nostrils with a putrid
stench.  His horse was sitting in the very back stall, and the stable
boys had yet to get to him, being as the inn had been relatively full
that night.  "Quickly, is there another exit from the bar...  I mean
stables?" he asked the boy.
<br><br>
"Aye sire, through that sliding door, " the boy answered pointing to
a door that was barely visibly only by a crack slightly larger then
normal in the wooden planks.  Indreju said his thanks and started to
throw a boy a small coin when he realized that he left his figure of
Fennin Ro back on his table.  He could not leave it, and yet could not
go back to retrieve it.  Cursing under his breath and wondering what
possible crime against his gods he could have done to deserve this, he
mounted his horse and prepared to leave out the back.
<br><br>
The shouts of the drunks from outside told him that someone was
still sober enough to check the stables, and that his time was running
out.  Vowing to his god to return later to retrieve the artifact, he
kick the door open and raced out the back just as he heard the drunks
get to the front of the stables.   Barely making an escape, and
wondering how to retrieve his precious artifact.
