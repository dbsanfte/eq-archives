My Wife sat down behind me, and watched the monitor as I plugged away at the keyboard
in a turbulent game of Quake II Capture the flag.  
<br><br>
<em>"I’m just going to watch you play"</em> She said as she leaned forward to relax her chin
on the back of my shoulder.
<br><br>
<em>"Uh huh"</em> I barely acknowledged her, due to the Total Concentration Factor.
I call this  "<b>TCF</b>"

My TCF suddenly changed from Quake to the stabbing pain in my back.
<br><br>
I shrugged her bony chin off my shoulder.
<br><br>
My attention then went back to the game as I regained my TCF.  The red team, while
being bombarded with hundreds of rockets, once again escaped down the air shaft with
our freak’en flag!

<td valign="top" width="33%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">

<em>"Son of a (BEEP) these guys (BEEP)!"</em> I shouted, totally appalled by the lack of
talent on my team.
<br><br>
While Gaping at the monitor I could see My Wife’s reflection. Her friendly smile
was transforming into a not-so-pleasing frown.
