The next morning, in the cold light of day, the idea seemed like career suicide. She spent the day in uncharacteristic silence, but Thagor did not mention it.  He took her on a tour of Kaladim, showed her all the changes that had occurred since she'd been there last, and proudly displayed the forge he had established with his brother and the money he'd gathered in the years of his adventurous youth.  In the late afternoon, he begged off to go conduct services in the local temple.  He was still a cleric, and took his duties to his god most seriously.  Alone in his house, Elnore put her head in her hands and tried to think of a way to save her reputation.  She would never, if she lived as long as a High Elf, live this one down.

<center><big><b>The Politics of Fear - Role Playing a Troll</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	In my third installment of role-playing races articles I deviate from following Oghma's order of race coverage and have found myself writing from the Swamps near Grobb. Amidst the happy frog people and jolly Fungus men that inhabit the swamps of Innothule, dwell Trolls. Trolls are almost exclusively born to serve Cazic-Thule, God of Terror. Some EverQuest literature refers to Trolls as anarchists, while other classic references would create an image of cunning evil beasts.

Renthiel struggled to clear his head.  The pain, instead of focusing his thoughts, was dragging him perilously close to unconsciousness.   He couldn't let that happen though.  Ever since he was captured and beaten, he had hung on desperately to avoid losing consciousness.  His meager few spells would disappear from memory the moment he gave in.  He could not let that happen.  Not while his troll captors held his precious spell book... if they hadn't destroyed it already.

She lay hidden behind thick foliage, blending into the forest like only a wood elf ranger could, her quick elven eyes keeping a close watch on the band of orcs despite the darkness.  She almost chuckled it was so easy.  The orcs, though quiet when moving through their forest home, had become noisy and boisterous now that they were near their target.  A fire burned in the small clearing where nine of them had made camp, heating the bodies of the orcs and making it even easier for her eyes to pick them out.  Their grappling hooks and climbing gear plainly stated their intentions to make a raid on the nearby treetop city of Kelethin.

	The goblin cocks it's head. The rattle of a pebble on stone draws it's attention, but it is not so distracted that it's prey gets away. With a quick twist, it finishes it's game and stuffs it into a bag. Moving along the ridge with utmost caution it comes to the landing and looks down into the canyon leading to the forest. Gnomes! A caravan of them! Five small ones and four of them are carrying heavy packs! With a wicked grin full of pointed teeth, the scout abandons his post and runs for camp.

Grey walls tower'd above her, a sharp cry, a blackened door --<br>
She shivered in the cold wind and then, she spotted Tanidor.<br>
Warmth started to suffuse her, as it spread from limb to limb<br>
And her batting eyelashes flirted, focusing only in on him.<br>
She laid her arm o'er his elbow, resting fingers on his wrist,<br>
He smiled and ponderingly asked, "Should I add a little mist?

Well, my CD still isn't here.  That's a bit disappointing.  But I suppose it might arrive Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
I hear that a lot of folks are having trouble connecting to the game servers.  I hear it because I read the newsgroups.  Lots of yelling.  Posts with titles like 'Verant is ripping us off!' and 'Verant should be sued!', except more often in all caps.  And I've read a few posts from folks that are willing to wait and let Verant iron out the problem.  Responses to those posts usually include the word (if it is a word) asskisser.

I, Zben the Enchanter would like to correct a small oversight in one of
your recent articles. First off, Oghma, in his article on Dwarves, was
clearly misled by whatever dwarves he talked too. While the Dwarves may
in fact be the first children of Brell Serlis, it is quite obvious that
they were but an imperfect first attempt.

<em>Why do Player Killers (the VAST majority, anyway) play sociopaths?  I mean, what society in history has tolerated the wanton death and destruction that these people seem to thrive upon?  What defect in their character makes them crave killing of innocents?  Just a few thoughts that I have been asking myself.  But the most profound, why do we allow them to continue????
