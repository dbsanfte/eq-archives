	Here is something that I found in the Avault news group.

Well, I understand your concern.  But the idea is to make pkilling so
difficult to get away with that it is rarley worth while.  On that mud I
mentioned, Pkilling by far is not the focus, although it is just another
element you need to keep in mind.  It worked out quite well in there, so I
don't see why it woulden't in here.  As for loop holes, I see no potential
ones.

Actually, the idea behind the PK switch is to make it so we don't have to make
pkilling difficult to get away with and rarely worthwhile.  We will have no
bias towards or against pkillers.  If you want to make a PK character, go for
it.  Also, we aren't judging pkilling as evil, either.  We don't have to.  We
envision good pkillers as well -- for example, paladins whose holy goal it is
to rid the world of necromancers and their ilk.  PK characters can enter
cities and such without fear of instant attack by guards as well.
<br><br>
This is the whole basis behind the switch -- pkillers, do your thing! Kill,
kill, kill.  We don't need to penalize you or make your lives extra-hard.  But
those who don't want to be involved with pkilling, just create a non-PK
character and have fun.  Work together, solve quests, explore -- and don't
worry about a PK 10 lvls higher than you ruining your day and looting your
corpse.
<br><br>
Best of both worlds.

<big><big>T</big></big>his message shocked me.  It actually made me think that I may not want to play EverQuest when it reaches retail and "the masses" start playing.  While I am concerned with what Brad said, I am more concerned with the way he said it and what I felt he left unsaid.

The first sentence was the strongest and the one that scared me the most.  "Actually, the idea behind the PK switch is to make it so we don't have to make pkilling difficult to get away with and rarely worthwhile."  Does he really mean that there will be no consequences to killing a player character in EverQuest?  Wow.  I have written an article already regarding what could happen if the players in EverQuest see the switch while looking through their characters eyes.  In short, I feared that there would be a group of indestructible characters sipping ale and chatting while watching another group of characters killing and looting each other for sport.  I urged that we as players not allow the switch to interfere with our characters, to play as if it did not exist whenever possible.
<br><br>
I never imagined that this scenario might be designed into the game!  A feature, no less!

I almost fainted as I read this.  This almost perfectly describes my greatest fear for EverQuest.  And this was written by the man in charge of the game’s creation!  What Brad seems to imply here is that there will be a lot of great quests and game play elements in the game, but that only characters with the switch off have any real right to participate in them.  The rest, the pkillers, should expect and only deserve to play the arcade version of EverQuest.  EQ, the game that blends Furcadia and Quake II in the same world.
<br><br>
"Best of both worlds."
<br><br>
Shudder....
<br><br>
Brad.  I hope I am misreading you in this.  I truly hope that you meant that EverQuest would be the best world, singular.  If you truly believe that pkilling is something that does not belong in the game, take it out.  While I would not like that idea very much, I like it a lot better than the vision I had after reading that post.  If you intend to leave the ability to kill other player characters in the game, then account for it with restrictions and in game justice/morality.
<br><br>
DO NOT allow yourself to create the game that you described in that news group post.
<br><br>
OK, this one might get me in trouble.  But I will rely on the good senses of the EverQuest team and their leader to understand my intention: to be critical with the hope for improvement, not to abuse.
