An essay by a so far unnamed Erudite Scholar:
<br><br>

As most of us know, the Combine Empire is one of complete mystery. Much of the written records were lost or destroyed and, while speculation has proven interesting, no definitive theory has been developed as to its fate nor the lack of surviving documents.  This has in turn made scholarly work in this area virtually impossible, but nevertheless an interesting pursuit.
<br><br>
As most of you well know, I am a scholar of theology and my interest in the Combine Era is mostly plainly placed in their religious practices and views.  How did they differ from those we have today?  How much of this has been handed down from their generation and survived the age between?  In the myriad of Combinal studies, I hope for much the same as my colleagues: merely to help to add to this understanding of the age of Antonious and the reign of his empire.
<br><br>
It is this pursuit that has lead me to a most interesting discovery.  Most interesting indeed.
<br><br>
In my studies I came across a text which intrigued me a great deal.  Buried back among the stacks of the Great Library of Erudin was a small journal, mostly decayed with age.  The destructive paths of bookworms riddled its surface and much of the ink had long since faded.  The book was a journal of sorts and what passages I could translate (and that remained unblemished) were few and far between.  Its author is still unknown to me, but I suspect now that he was Vizier of sorts in the Combine Empire; quite possibly in service of Antonious himself.
<br><br>
The books condition made it apparent that its value had been overlooked and it had sat neglected for centuries perhaps.  I can only hope that we have no more works such as this tossed about like garbage and that they are safely stored and preserved.  In fact I have requested the keepers of the library to undergo a massive review of their inventory in hopes of finding any others that may have somehow been misjudged and left among the less scholarly works to rot.  We can ill afford to overlook another text such as this.  The magnitude of the crime we have committed, not only against knowledge but against all Norrath is beyond comprehension.
<br><br>
After weeks of study I was sure that the journal's purpose was clear.  It detailed the study and experiments of the long lost art of Geomancy.  Now understand, this work is in no condition to reveal any of this arts secrets.  Its pages are mostly mottled with age and the ink flakes cleanly from the page at the slightest touch.  I have given this book of course, to the School of Combinal Studies where it is under review by the top experts in the field of Geomancy.  While I fear little remains of the book to add to the current debates over this lost art, it may have some hidden information.
<br><br>
But the importance of the book to me as a theologian is possibly more surprising.  Indeed one must wonder what, if anything, of religious significance could be found in the journal of a Geomancer.  I therefore most humbly submit my findings.
<br><br>
Within its pages one section remained mostly undamaged.  It told of an experiment of great importance to this Geomancer; from it I have speculated that Geomancy is, for the most part, an earth bound art and not that of a mathematical nature as some have suggested.  This experimenter's interest seemed to lie in the very makeup of the world as we see it.  Well beyond the mountains, or the rock that makes up the mountain even; deeper than much of our sciences and devotions would look to penetrate today.   Here is a passage, translated with assistance from E. Fotra (Breaks in the passage indicated damaged or lost wording.):
<br><br>
<em>"Most unique [break in passage] found to be held together [break]  A constant struggle is seen between these forces. [break] have yet to name.  [break] isolate it?"</em>
<br><br>
From this passage we can see, the experimenter intends to isolate a force of some kind which holds something together.  Very vague but it intrigued me and, upon further investigation, I think this next passage sheds some light on this:
<br><br>
<em>"...struggle happens everywhere so it seems.  This table, the earth beneath, my very body.  [break] in the realm of the divine?"</em>
<br><br>
And further on we have this passage, seemingly a report of success filled with an interesting urgency:
<br><br>
<em>"...it!  [break]  But it is not there [break] nothing [break] fights against substance and is no substance.  The very existence keeps it at bay. [break] nameless."</em>
<br><br>
This passage above all intrigued me.  It instantly reminded me of my own research.  As a specialist in Combinal religion I have always been most interested in those entries to the various religious text that seem to have developed or come into popularity during the Combinal age.  There is a series of these which many of you who have read my previous treatise will know of as the 'Cants of Contradiction.'  They appear in all the works of the gods and are widely regarded as a mystery.  Some seem utterly out of place and most appear in obscure, not often studied, passages of the religious tomes.   For those of you unfamiliar with my work I have included passages from these texts at the end of this essay.
<br><br>
Many of the texts are also in some agreement on one thing.  Most agree on a 'Creatio ex Nihlo' or a creation from nothing.  Though they all argue over the specifics (particular which Divinity brought forth the world from chaos or 'nothing') some texts support a different view.  The texts of the Marr twins and that of The Warlord, Rallos Zek, all mention a third force involved in creation prior to even their existence.  They speak of the 'Nothing' from which creation began in personal terms.  And Innoruuk's 'Tome of Hate' contains a malicious curse to the other divinities who have populated Norrath without his consent: "Woe to you thieving, scheming fools!  May the Nameless devour you just as he spat you out in a fit of sickness!"  
<br><br>
The Nameless is also spoken of frequently in what little we have of the texts of Veeshan.  Those who know my research know that I am of the persuasion that the Nameless is the force behind Norraths and, however heretical it may seem, the divine host's conceptions.
<br><br>
Now, perhaps you are starting to see a glimmer of the connection I am trying to make.  I will first say I have tried to approach this in an unbiased manner as all scholars must approach their work, but I assure you that I am nothing beyond mortal and my imperfections do exist.  However, I don't feel I am stepping beyond my bounds or chasing my own fancy.  I am very confident that those who examine the Geomancer's Journal will come to the same conclusion.
<br><br>
The Geomancers interest in the very fabric of reality led him to an interesting discovery.  A constant battle wages beneath our feet and in our very bones.  That from which we sprang seeks always to return but is held back in this struggle.  That Nameless force that made us struggles to undo the very world around us.  But substance prevails, by the grace of... well the grace of who or what I am uncertain.  
<br><br>
But the most important part remains.  And I am loath to speak of it but in the interest of scholarly research everywhere and in the interest of the world I feel it is my duty.  The Geomancer succeeded in isolating this struggle and breaking it down.  Further passages speak of a device he created.  It is not known whether it is magical or otherwise, but this device was used to expose the Nameless; to weaken the substance so that he could reveal the force it fought against.
<br><br>
I will not quote any such passages which detail this device.  Even though they are sparse and incomplete, reasons should be evident.  However, I will quote the final passage:
<br><br>
<em>"...oh fate so cruel! [break] cannot fall into [break]  It must be recovered and destroyed! [break] curse the day I created this [break]  All of Norrath is in peril."</em>
<br><br>
On a scholarly level I must not feign disinterest.  Perhaps this can explain the loss of the art of Geomancy or the disappearance of Combine Empire?  However, I should hope the gravity of the situation is seen beyond scholarly light.  For from what it appears this device was lost and perhaps it was recovered and destroyed?  Who knows.  But heavens help us should it still exist, for the implications are staggering.  If such a device were to fall into the wrong hands, all of Norrath would be in jeopardy.
<br><br>
<b>Cants of Contradiction:</b>
<br><br>
<u>Rodcet Nife: Prayer of the Annointed</u><br>
And we shall all be cleansed in the face of it and shall meet the Dark with polished souls.
<br><br>
<u>Erollisi Marr:  Heart</u><br>
The eternal Heart shall beat back the force without names and survive even its tempests, for love is eternal.  In the final days when Norrath rejoins its maker the Love shall endure.
<br><br>
<u>Mithaniel Marr:  Book of Illuminated Valor</u><br>
Show Valor in all times and in all ways for in truth and strength shall the good triumph over evil.  In Valor shall the lands be made whole until the waterless ocean engulfs the world.
<br><br>
<u>Tunare:  Tale of the Tree</u><br>
Innoruuk! You have stolen my children, plundered my most precious of treasures!  I weep for your folly, slave of the Hate.  For your mind shall be conquered by its forked tongue until the sun sets eternal and we are all returned to our slumber.
<br><br>
<u>Innoruuk:  Tome of Hate</u><br>
The Hate is master of all and creator of the world.  Lies have spread and vicious rumor seeks to depose it, but It is The Source of all save that which cannot be seen.
<br><br>
<u>Cazic-Thule: Skin of the Lost</u><br>
Do not wait for my command!  Do not wait for my word!  Go unto the world and make them know me... make them know FEAR!  For your time is short here and those who are not my slaves are my EXAMPLES and shall live in PAIN even beyond the blackness of Final Destruction.
<br><br>
<u>Bertoxxulous:  Praises to Decay</u><br>
Rot! Stench! Lovely puss! <br>
Drinketh of the dragons cut! <br>
All of the same father, All of no name, <br>
And all can be rendered helpless and lame!<br>
<br>
<u>Rallos Zek:  War</u><br>
Beyond lies a sword without an edge which can sunder the world in two.  But strive not to wield this sword for it shall surely cut down its wielder as well.  To grasp it is to know victory, to use it is to know defeat. A sword of enigma; a weapon without name.
<br><br>
<u>Karana:  Thunder!</u><br>
I looked low to the ground before the Bringer of Storms and dared ask a question.  "Master, of what are the skies and the clouds made?"<br>
"Nothing child as is all."<br>
<br>
<u>Brell: </u><br>
Tis under the Earth it is.  That's Brell's world. What lies under the feet of the unsuspecting and rises up around their heads.  Even th' mighty Wyrm seeks his solace.  And the Children of the Mother seek to anchor to 'em.  Why Brell's domain is most important I tell ya.  Well... except where there's Nothing.
<br><br>
<u>Quellious: </u><br>
Peace children.  Peace with all.  We are all nothing yet all of something.  Whether we are here or the Void, shall we be in peace.
<br><br>
<u>Veeshan:  Writ of the Scale</u><br>
I was born of nothing before anything and thus all is my domain and all are my vassals.  Kneel before my brood and be devoured or suffer the agony of the Unraveling.
<br><br>
<u>The Tribunal: </u><br>
There is a fourth.  To know it is to understand Nothing, but the world is held together by it's grasp.
<br><br>
<u>Solusek Ro: </u><br>
No passage here but there is an obscure ritual that predated the Combine Empire but came into more frequent using during the Empire's reign.  It involves sitting blindfolded amidst a series of bonfires (or in one depending on your mastery of flame) and meditating on the mantra:  "Forever, beyond the end.  In the face of the Nameless, in the blackness of nothing, the flame shall burn!"
<br><br>
<u>Bristlebane: </u><br>
And so I walked by and grabbed a stone from his pocket; and no one was the wiser of course.  And he continued on his way.  And I looked at the stone and thought to throw it at the nape of his neck and hide behind a bush.  But the stone was no longer there.  I had borrowed something from him yet held nothing.  The stranger turned with a smile and said, 'That's all there is.... in your hand'.  I spoke, 'What do you mean, there's nothing in my hand!'  He smiled.  'There never was.'  I fell back to the shadows to watch him leave and sought to follow but he was gone from sight.
