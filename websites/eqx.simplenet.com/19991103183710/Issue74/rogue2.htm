<b>Part Two</b>
<br><br>
   As the years passed, Kinory's father grew more intractable, and her mother more withdrawn.  The charming, free-spirited Ranger grew quiet and meek.  The only things that brought her out were the letters from Gwyn.  She and Kinory would read them late at night in Kinory's room, a mild conspiracy against Holyd, who forbade even the mention of Gwyn's name.  
<br><br>
   The letters came four or five times a year, carried by travel-worn Rangers or Clerics.  Once, a particularly battered and folded letter was delivered by a towering Barbarian Warrior, who thrust the parchment wordlessly at Kinory the moment she opened the door, and then stomped off, muttering to himself about being a "messenger service".
<br><br>
   Her brother's letters brought alive the world outside Greater Faydark.  She traveled with him to Felwithe and through the long journey to Freeport, where the Militia was looking for recruits, Gwyn had heard.  She laughed when he was first accepted and then promoted to officer training, and wept when a scrawled note told of his first campaign out into the Desert of Ro, and how he had seen his fellows die before him.  He was awarded a medal, but that they only heard because his superior also wrote to Maya, to tell her of her son's bravery.  Maya had smiled with pride, then wept, and Kinory could only hold her, and curse her father helplessly.
<br><br>
   Kinory learned to despise her father in those years.  His petty rages grew, and his demands became more and more impossible.  Her mother became less, a shadow of her former self, one that never argued with anyone about anything.  The night that Gwyn left was the last time Kinory heard her mother's voice raised in anger.  Kinory began spending days at a time in the forest, despite her father's anger and disapproval.  The city, lofty and open as it was, began to feel a prison to her, and she rarely slept in her bed.  She spent long hours, too, at the Ranger guild, where many of the Guardians of Faydark remembered her mother fondly.   They encouraged her and taught her some of the skills of the guild.  She had a natural knack for tracking, and knew that they hoped she would follow her mother's path, but she put off making a decision.  She was uneasy, restless, sure that life held more than the gloom of the forest and the constant bitter sniping of her father.  She daydreamed of running away to find Gwyn.  At times, she felt her soul beating against the restrictions of her life like a frenzied bird in a cage.

   The year after Gwyn left, all Kelethin was shocked and titillated by the return of one of its more infamous former citizens.  Daryth Cinviel had came back to his childhood home to visit with family, it was said, but what family and where did not seem to be part of anyone's knowledge.  No one had seen him, either, said Holyd, the night after the rumors began to fly, his lips compressed.
<br><br>
   "And everyone knows, when you can't see a Rogue is when you must be most on your guard."  He glared across the dinner table at Kinory.  "And don't you be seeking him out, young lady.  I know you well.  Any hint of danger and you'd leap into it headfirst."  She gave him her most innocent look.
<br><br>
   That night, she shinnied down the vines outside her window and set off into town.  The taverns first, she decided.   She found him at the first inn she stuck her head into.  Daryth sat at the bar, looking like any other of the many adventurers that passed through Kelethin, except for the air of deep and secret amusement about him.  He nursed a pint of Kalish and gazed around the room as though the sight of the drunken patrons gave him great satisfaction.  She entered boldly and went right to the stool beside his.
<br><br>
   "A flask of elven wine, please," she requested.  The barkeep looked her up and down for a minute, opened his mouth, and then shut it again when she spun a silver mark across to him.  He drew her drink, shaking his head, and then went back to polishing glasses.  She turned casually to Daryth, and gave him a long considering look.  He glanced sideways at her and then barked a laugh.
<br><br>
   "Hello there."  He turned to her and examined her from head to toe.  Unlike the innkeep's, his perusal made her blush like fire.  It... suggested.  
<br><br>
   "Hello yourself.  Master Cinviel."   She said coolly.  He grinned like a boy.
<br><br>
   "Finally, someone recognizes me.  I haven't been gone that long, surely."  He straightened and scrubbed a hand through his short blond hair.  His smile pulled at the long scar down his left cheek, but it didn't seem to matter.  His smile lit his face like a sunrise. 
<br><br>
   "I didn't recognize you," she answered.  "You just looked exactly like I imagined you would."  As the words left her mouth, she cursed herself for a mawkish fool.  Imagined him!  Like a daydreaming hero-worshiper!  He smiled again, and she flushed even further, and buried her face in her cup.
 <br><br>
  "How old are you, anyway?" he asked, amused.  
<br><br>
   "Fifteen," she said, casting a glance sideways at the innkeep.  He was out of hearing range, but only just.
<br><br>
   "Fifteen," Daryth said, shaking his head.  She glared defiantly at him.  "Well, I was doing worse things at that age than sneaking into taverns, I suppose.  Well, you've found me.  Why were you looking?"
<br><br>
    She shrugged.
<br><br>
   "I don't know," she said.  Sitting here, it did seem pointless.  She stared glumly at the bottom of her cup.
<br><br>
   "The reality is not as exciting as all the stories of my exploits, I guess."  He regarded her now with an expression of understanding.  "Nothing is like the stories, my dear.  That's one of the most important lessons that life teaches you, and the hardest to learn."  He dropped his gaze to his own drink.
<br><br>
   "I know that one already," she said.  He looked back at her, surprised by the bitterness in her voice.
<br><br>
   "Is that the agony of youth I hear?"  She raised her eyes to his.  "Perhaps not.  How did one as young as you get so jaded?"
<br><br>
   "At home, of course," said Kinory glibly.  "Where all life's most important lessons are learned." Daryth snorted softly. 
<br><br>
   "Indeed," he said.  "Want to go for a walk, m'lady?"  He set down his Kalish and offered her his arm.  She regarded it dubiously.   "I will be a perfect gentleman, I promise."  She met his eyes for a long moment, then shrugged.
<br><br>
   "Why not?"  she said flippantly.  She downed her wine in one gulp.  He smothered a smile as she coughed and gasped.  
<br><br>
   "Careful with that stuff."   She nodded, eyes watering, embarrassed all over again.  He helped her up, and they left the inn together.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
   Their night ramble set a precedent, and for over a month, while Daryth conducted his unknown (and, according to Holyd, nefarious) business, Kinory spent many nights wandering with and learning from the Rogue. Days, Kinory would find a tree with a convenient nook and fall asleep draped over a branch.  Daryth was filled with insights about why people behaved the way they did.  In his line of work, he claimed, knowing why people did the things they did was the difference between being successful and rich, and being dead or in jail.   He was also filled with knowledge about other things, such as picking locks, and fading into the shadows so well that even when she knew he was there, she could hardly tell where he stood.   He gave her a set of lock picks and she practiced on her father's chests in the sitting room.  She found three letters from Gwyn.  Burning with anger, she left them where they were.  Hoyld would surely notice their absence, and she wasn't prepared to confront him.  
<br><br>
   Daryth also taught her a few of the Rogue guild signs, and a few of the sigils used by his own band.  When she found a few of them in Kelethin, she was delighted.  Daryth warned her never to mark one herself, unless she was ready to commit herself to joining them.  
<br><br>
   "Rogues," he said, "pride themselves on their secrecy and ability to conceal themselves.  They don't take kindly to outsiders knowing anything about them."
<br><br>
   "Why are you teaching me all this then?"  she demanded.  He shrugged casually.
<br><br>
   "I'm bored out here."  It was all he would say, and she never pushed him about anything.  She was too afraid that he would tell her to go away.  She never asked him why he was in Kelethin, and when he didn't show up at the tavern, she didn't try to find him.  Not only was she sure she would never find him, she was also sure that he would know of her attempt.  She wasn't going to risk his displeasure.  Instead, she would practice her skills.  She worked diligently, hoping for a word of approval, a look that said he was pleased with her.  It never came.  All he ever said was "keep working".   It made her more determined than ever.
<br><br>
   Her mother knew that something was going on, but although she noticed Kinory's red and bleary eyes and breakfast each morning, she never spoke about it.  Once, as Kinory left the house, she looked back and saw Maya's figure at a window.  For a moment , they looked at one another, and then Maya turned away and let the curtain drop.  Kinory could not tell her about Daryth, and her mother would not ask.  They existed in a wary but peaceful state, allied in an unspoken conspiracy to keep Kinory's nighttime rambles from Holyd.  Holyd himself never noticed any change in either Kinory or his wife, and although they never spoke of it, the situation gave Kinory a feeling of closeness with her mother that had been missing since Gwyn's departure.
<br><br>
   And then, one night, she came to the tavern, and found only a note.  The innkeep handed it to her with a smirk.  She barely noticed.  The handwriting was backsloped, elegant but abrupt.  She knew who it was from.  Her heart sinking in her chest, she took it from the man and carried it home to read in her chamber.  She knew what it had to say.
