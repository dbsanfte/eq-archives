Cheating became evident even before the game was released, when the game was still in beta!  Players would take advantage of bugs found in the software, exploit them, and not inform anyone but other player’s worthy of the information.  Even after the game was released public, cheating once more surfaced (but not as serious as seen with Diablo).  To my knowledge non-of these cheats were alteration in code through uses of homemade applications, but more exploits in bugs found in the actual code (i.e. the money cheat using the time warp bug, teleporting into someone’s home).  The list goes on.

I take a strong stance on cheating.  I think these game companies should inflict real life penalties on players that are caught cheating.  I read that Sony would be prosecuting persons attempting to tamper with EverQuest™ game data, and for that I commend them!  I for one don’t want my gaming experience ruined because someone else chose to take the short road to success.

  If you want to cheat, make that part of your online character.  Become a thief, and steal from your victims.  I hope everyone feels the way I do about this, and supports future releases of multi-player games by reporting this type of activity.  Of course if everyone felt the way I did about this subject, I wouldn’t be writing this article.
