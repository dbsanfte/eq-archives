One of the most fascinating things about Ever Quest is the built in grouping system. It reminds me of all the Muds I have played over the years, inviting others into my group, having a private group send so I can talk to just the people I am adventuring with. Thus far my main character, a Monk of the 13th order, has spent most of his time grouping with people, making friends and doing very little solo adventuring. 
<br><br>
When I wanted to try a different class for a while, I also wanted to see if I could apply my old Power leveling techniques from Muds to EQ. The game is not designed for this, yet I have heard tales of it working for some people. 
<br><br>
So I embarked on my mission with a Human Ranger. Human was the choice because there is no experience point penalty for race, and Ranger because I thought tracking might be really helpful in playing solo, and it was. 
<br><br>
I have been playing this character for a few days now, and am happy to report that although its quiet and lonely often, you can solo, and level fast doing it. There are some key points to doing it this way though, and here are some of my thoughts on that. 
<br><br>
First off, solo does not mean anti-social. I always help others when they need it, and in return, I find most will help me when needed. You will need help occasionally. There is no valor in death, just a loss of exp and that does not help you in your goal to level. Dont be afraid to ask for help when you need it, and never hesitate to make a name for yourself as being helpful.
<br><br>
Second and really most important, you can not stay in one area. I have had time to travel all over and to most of the cities now in my various characters. One thing I have decided is that somewhere, there is the perfect solo monster for each Level of each Class. You just have to find the right one for you. What I mean by perfect is that you can find a monster that when you consider it, the fight should be slightly in your favor, and you can fight several in a row without having to rest. These will also give you good exp. I have found by traveling long distances at certain levels, I can find these monsters to fight, if you know what you are looking for. 
<br><br>
For your first character then, if you don't know the world, or you are just starting to play, this may not be possible, but often if you ask others of your class higher levels then you, "what did you fight at L#?" they will tell you. Ask a few people of your class and see what they say. Once you start to go up in levels some, you will remember monsters that were too hard for you in an area, and they might be better for you now. But the secret is to travel. No single area is good for all levels when you are playing solo. I personally have traveled from Halas down to Greater Faydark, just to fight a specific monster for a few levels. 
<br><br>
When you are traveling a lot and you are solo, the most important things to know is where to run to. Either the nearest zone border, or the nearest guard. When in combat switch overhead angles often, and scan the area around you while fighting, you dont need any nasty surprises while engaged in melee.
<br><br>
Ever Quest is not meant to be played solo, but not everyone is into grouping, so these are some ideas on surviving alone in a world where everything wants to eat you for lunch.
