The readers must forgive me but this article is going to be a combination of a few modes throughout it's length which will be completely IC statements from Oxes view, my inserting what's going on in her head, and an actual game log of a particular event.  Basically some dramatic in-games things have happened to my main character Oxesiess that will forever be a large mark on her life no matter how long she exists.  I thought it the perfect opportunity to write of not only role-playing in game, but also one of the few distinctions that I feel can happen between or to characters.  Those that know me or have heard my stance on a few game issues are already are aware that I feel there're few actual character defining actions regarding the world we can perform.  In short for others that have not heard my full opinion on the subject and for the purpose of this article, I feel mostly we either have to create a character defining situation or log in at lucky time and happen to run into a GM.  Almost everything is else is set to "do-over" mode until we get it right in our characters lives.  Many players speak out that they are tired of the repetition in the game and that they can't "DO anything permanent *ever*!"  I disagree with this statement and will now lay before everyone a large part of Oxesiess' life.
<br><br>
I actually didn't purposely set out to make these things happen to her, nor have I tried to guide events.  The beautiful part of what I am about to share with you is that these two events occurred simply due to what EverQuest is, a game to be played long term.  Eventually just from length of playing time, I hope more players get to have such character defining events or twists take place during their character's lives.  Just the sheer influx of people coming in and out of the game cause us to grow apart, loose touch, and get back in touch with other characters.  The end results can be, in my opinion, very fascinating.  Oxesiess lost BOTH of her heroes in under a months time back to back.  This loss is a perfect example of how our characters CAN make permanent and changing things happen in Norrath.  I wish the reader to note at this time that while I am going to mention some names of players, I don't particularly like to do it for several reasons but there's really no way around it.
<br><br>
Oxesiess does not define a hero the way perhaps most would.  She has a pretty narrow view due to her lack of world understanding.  Barbarian Shaman, of course, will always be held in awe by her and to apply the term "Hero" would probably be a demotion of their status in her eyes.  A hero to her was "da Best o Bash'n".  Which really means someone from the barbarian tribe and someone in the same line of work she is in, a warrior.  This doesn't mean she can't recognize great fighters across the land, but a Hero is someone she hopes to one day emulate.  Her imagination doesn't stretch far enough to enable her to look at other races and get past trying to see herself short and fighting that good.  These two heroes of hers have been a driving force her entire career as a warrior.  Looking back, I can see that even though our hard hunting times were relatively short in terms of game commercial release, these two have never actually left her life.  Nor have they lifted their influence on Oxesiess goals even though they might not be aware of how much their personas impacted her.  Now, however, they have passed into stories to be only told around campfires by Oxesiess as she looks back on her life.  You see, she will have to find a new Hero to look up to, though at this time she's so pouty I think she's swearing off Heroes and gonna try to go it "wiff out em".

<u>Duncan</u>
<br><br>
"Dis was back when da Norrath was still dangerous ta leave far from da home fires and not many could face da gnolls yet.  Da gnolls were all safe and cozy way down in da burrow.  Barbs hadn't yet cleared da passes ta makes it fully safe fer travel back and forth, but I was gonna try.  I was chasin a gnoll down in da pits o da Burrow and da stinky thingy jumped IN da water.  Phaw!  It knew I's had me monthly bath and wasn't bout ta git drowned down der.  It was swim'n over ta a pack o big uns.  What it thinky I's a barb-cub gonna follow it?  Bah I say!  So what's I do?  What any right minded good bashy does, I's stand at da edge and start scream'n at da bastage bout what a wussy stinky gnoll it was.  Dat I's know sled doggies braver than it!  Dat barb-cubs still in poopoo cloths were braver than...  Den he was der.  He was laughing at me cause I was a stand'n at da edge o da water all a scream'n it seems to no one but meself cause da gnoll had done swamed off by dis time.  I tolded him da gnoll ran away in da water I was trying to git it back...  dat was how we done met."
<br><br>
Even though some would call me crazy for standing around in the middle of a dungeon to yell at a gnoll in /say that will not respond and that performing such an action wouldn't accomplish a single thing, this is a true story.  It was a few days after EverQuest went commercial that he walked up to Oxesiess as she screamed at a pond of water in /say.  I remember those days very well, people would still creep down that ramp to look around.  Blackburrow was very much still a dangerous place to get so far in and players huddle together in non-groups hoping to survive or die with the stranger next to them.  He was a level higher than her at the time, but he already had saved up for an nice two-handed weapon.  Her breath caught as she saw it.  Eyes wide, I remember I had her dancing from foot to foot wanting to reach out and touch it.  Admiring the shining glint with blood dripping from the end, it was all she could do not to just test to see how sharp it was on her own flesh.  Duncan then took Oxesiess deep into the burrow.  He showed her for the first time the snake pits.  On the ledge outside of the pits many times they thought they were done for, but he never left her.  Taunting and swinging against trains that would sometimes start, they'd stand and die together.  Rarely did they hope to make it out from so deep inside the Burrow, nor did they want to hurt others trying.  For hours, and days, she and Duncan battled the gnolls tooth, nail and taunt.  Then it happened, she came to Blackburrow and the shiny two-hander was gone.  He had traveled to Freeport and sent a letter asking her to join him, but she couldn't leave her Holy with no warrior to show the gnolls proper respect to his person.

<u>Kayler</u>
<br><br>
"So I's in da North Karana.  O course back den, it was SUPER creepy.  I was da only one der, and it was raining and stuff.  I's jist finished a way mean fight and welpers, I's a bit jittery o what was out there, so I's walked ta almost da end o da bridge.  Figured I's far enough away dat iffen any creepys came I could git away at me walk.  Ayeps I was hurted bad, couldn't even run.  Den, I heard da thunder and jumped.  I was an awful mess.  I's mean what was I doin down der?  Me furs itched from all da lil black thingys in em, none o those in Halas.  Me bear hat was fill'n up wiff water in it's nose and gettin awful heavy.  Wet stuff fall'n from da sky, seesh!  And none o da Tribe around!  What was I's doin der?!?!  I's even thoughted da sniffles might be comin on and I's bout ta wipe me nose on me sleeve when I noticed a big boot next ta me.  I's looked up and felt da wind knocked outta me.  Der was da most beaut barb I's done ever seen.  He was all in METAL armor!  Not da patch stuff like me and had two mino axes!  He was like death a walk'n and I's almost couldn't talk.  But in relief not ta be alone I's go 'Hi ya's HI ya's it's so good ta see home folk!'  Knows what, he said 'Hello Lassie!' and den da sniffles came and I couldn't stop.  I sweared right den and der in between wiping me nose on me sleeve dat one day I'd walk up ta someone, dey see me boot from sitt'n, look up at me's like dat and start ta sniffle in relief.  Ayeps I was gonna grow up and be a mean barb like Kayler!"
<br><br>
Okay, so I am crazy because this is also a true story.  Yes it was very eerie back then when you'd realize you were completely alone in that zone.  Seeing another face, let alone a barb that far out, you'd feel all of a sudden a mix of Everfrost snow sickness and thrilled that more of you weren't in Everfrost.  Keep in mind the whole time Oxes hunted North Karana before and awhile after meeting Kayler, she was bound up in Everfrost.  Perhaps that put more of an edge on sitting alone in that zone or her battles since the battles were constantly of a nature were a hit from either it or Oxesiess would win the fight.  
<br><br>
Kayler and Oxesiess were almost inseparable for a time and our battles together are too numerable to list.  However one that sticks out above the rest in demonstrating the rapport they shared and justification in Oxesiess feelings about Kayler was in Runeye.  Two barbs outside the Kings room, there was hardly room to turn around in that hall, and things went bad.  The druid with us went into the Kings room to med, before Kayler could get out a "No" a gobby regened.  She ran around in the room as another regened and Kayler was yelling for her to get behind us.  Finally she jumps between us, I closed the gap, she dropped a heal on Kayler as we taunted the two gobbys off her and gated.  We had no healers with us, just a high-elf wizard who was medding himself, and both Kayler and I were around our middle bars in health.  For the next twenty minutes Kayler and I would taunt off each other while trying to get some health back up.  The gobbys had it in for us because they seemed an endless flood that never stopped coming.  I couldn't chase them because it would train all the ones outside, he couldn't leave me because the ones out of the Kings room were to many.  That fight, gobby after downed gobby, seemed to last hours and at the same time seemed a blink of an eye.  I don't know how Kayler and I managed to stay on our feet for so long against so many without a healer.  The corpses were from the outer door to the inner one.  You couldn't see the floor in the hallway there were so many, and the dang suckers just kept coming.  Finally, with two left and our wizard medding again, the choice had to be made.  The beautiful part was Kayler and I both knew without talking.  Oxesiess could either stand and die or Kayler could.  We were too badly hurt, there had to be a choice.  Kayler was larger in levels than Oxesiess, and with him he could finish the last one off and keep the wizard alive because he could chase the last gobby.  Oxesiess wouldn't be able to do that and if Kayler died she would follow shortly and so would the wizard.  Oxesiess came to in High Pass hold to the sound of her Hero in a Barb Zerked Rage and seeking druid blood.  All the way back to Runeye Kayler's yelling about the druid and keening over her corpse kept her company.  Oxesiess could only think though how proud she was to have stood and died in such a fight with her Hero.  That he was truly worthy that she though of him as one.
<br><br>
<u>The Loss of a Hero</u>
<br><br>
Your probably wondering, or think you know, how Oxesiess feels she lost her Heroes by this time but I can assure you, you're in for a surprise.  Actually one is a twist in life that's almost tragically sad, the other is not so much so since their encounters of fighting together were in many days gone by.  Oxesiess lost her heroes due to something she has never understood...
<br><br>
Marriage.
<br><br>
Duncan's wedding was beautiful.  It took place on the dock outside of an Inn in Highpass.  The roar of the waterfall could not compete with clerics voice as she bound Duncan to his beloved.  Oxesiess tried very hard to pay attention but Duncan's formal kilt had a thread hanging at the side and she desperately wanted to yank it loose.  Many were in tears from the lovely words that the High-elf spoke for the union, but Oxesiess was just a bit misty eyed because one of the major influences in her life now had someone else to protect, someone else to be a Hero to.  She didn't get all the "stuff dat da high-elf is talky bout".
<br><br>
Oxesiess has never had a love interest.  She was so thrilled to win the slam rites in Halas and be accepted into the Warrior training program, that she's dedicated everything in her life since she was young to becoming a better "bashy".  She pretty much skipped over that learning part in her young life due to weapon practice and never really encountered anything first hand in regards to a relationship.  Her biggest drive for viewing life is one that's rather hard to reconcile with being intimate with another person, violence.  Therefore, she pretty much "jist dunt git it".  To understand it all she's put marriage in terms she can at least partly comprehend correctly, her Hero becomes someone else Hero and swears it in front of a whole bunch of people that they are a Hero to that person only.
<br><br>
The day that Oxesiess heard that Kayler was to be married, everything around Oxesiess instantly went on her to-be-killed list.  I think she ran around killing green cons and wailing in /say for a good two hours while she refused to speak to any of her friends.  Then when finally the initial zerked rage was over, she spoke to Kayler.  This merely set her off on another wail fest since she remembered she had heard from someone else that Kayler was to be married and not from him.  Kayler asked her to be his "Best Bashy" and Oxesiess began to rant up a storm.
<br><br>
"Ya's want me ta stand up der and WATCH all o dis?  Ya's want me ta take part and say 'Okay Dokay ere's me Hero, Tribunal Bless ya's?  WAHHHH!!!  I's losted me hero and he wants me ta HELP in it!' "  Then Kayler showed up and Norrath played to the mood, it began to rain.  Standing there in the rain with her hero, Kayler told Oxesiess he'd always loved her.  Oxesiess sniffled "O course I's try to be good bashy and I's one o da tribe."  Kayler sighed and said she just didn't get it did she?  Oxesiess replied with "Ya's was always smarter dan me Booboo Barb Kayler even though ya's 'AM NOT' it ta others in da group.  Dat's why yer da hero."  Kayler told her back when they first met he had tried, but thought Oxesiess didn't want him so had given up hope that they would ever be at each others backs until the day they fell never to get up again.  Oxesiess blinked at him as the rain ran down between her eyes and for the first time in her life she wasn't noticing she was soaking wet.  She didn't know what to say and was struggling to think when this had all happened.  So she settled for saying, "Me heart feels likes it's cryin".  Kayler then put up his sword, touched her cheeks with his bloody glove to redraw her war paint washing off in the rain and told her there was a spot that no one could ever touch and it was Oxesiess'.  Kayler then turned and left.  
<br><br>
The wedding was about a week away and all week Oxesiess bemoaned constantly about it.  She'd flip flop between not going at all or going and saying just exactly what she thought about all of this.  Really she was absolutely impossible with all the fit pitching, I don't know how everyone put up with her.  The day arrived and I logged in with Oxesiess to get a /tell before I could hit her run button from Kayler to "Hurry!  We are starting shortly!"  When Oxesiess panics she falls back on orders which Kayler had the presence of mind to tell her partner to get Oxesiess up there now.  Oxesiess showed up to the gathering next to the North Karana bridge for her first glimpse of the "Hero taker" and she almost dropped to the ground.  Kayler was marrying a Holy One.  Taking a deep breath she approached the party where Kayler instructed her in her "Best Bashy Role" and introduced her to his bride.  The bride was absolutely sweet to Oxesiess, telling her how much Kayler had talked about her.  How glad Kayler was she could be here for him.  Oxesiess was glaring at Kayler over her shoulder and hoping the Holy One didn't see.
<br><br>
It's right about here the most tragic part of the story and evil twist of fate happened.  The Preacher for the ceremony couldn't make it.  Kayler was frantic, the Holy One was almost in tears and it began to rain.  Oxesiess took a deep breath and said "Oxes it's jist like bashy in Runeye".  Oxesiess then said, "I's do it, I's not a Holy One but she's a Holy so dat's da same thingy.  She can have da Tribunal bless me words as I speak em."  The following was captured by a scribe at the wedding, most likely to study "Barbaric Rituals":
<br><br>
Oxesiess says, 'Folks, he-guys, She-chicks and doggie woof woofs'<br>
Scraigar says, 'bye all good luck with the wedding'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'We's standin ere after da rain today'<br>
Kenaman says, 'thank you'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Cause these two like ta Bashy together'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'I's known da Kayler since he was a barb-cub'<br>
Kenaman says, 'ok I can't get rid of my bow :) it is a glitch'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'and He's worthy of this Holy Sham-Chicky'<br>
Benjiyardo says, 'hit auto attack twice'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Since we aren't up in da Halas'<br>
Askaria says, '*shhhh..*'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'We'll skip da slam rites'<br>
Nica pokes Kenaman.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Askaria....'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Do ya's take this Warrior'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'as a good bashy'<br>
Askaria says, 'I do :)'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'And promise ta heal him when almost deaded'<br>
Siegorny chuckles at Askaria.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'and Shrink him when he can't git through da doors?'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Dat when he's diseased ya's will not go'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Yuck git away?'<br>
Nica giggles.<br>
Kenaman says, 'smile'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'But make Medicine for him so he gits better?'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'for as long as ya's Both a Wolf o da North?'<br>
Askaria says, 'I do :)'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'And Kayler...'<br>
Kayler smiles at Askaria.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Winner o the Slam rites of Halas 5 times running'<br>
Askaria beams a smile at Kayler.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Basher of Gobbys'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Beater of Crags'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Smacker of Finger Wigglers'<br>
Kenaman smiles.<br>
Zimthor chuckles.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Do ya's promise when Askaria is git'n slaped around'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'ta Taunt constantly'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'her attacker'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Ta bandage her when almost deaded'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'ta swing even when ya's think you'll git deaded for it'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'so dat she may git away?'<br>
Kayler looks at Askaria.<br>
Kayler says, 'I do with all me heart'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'By da Power and Justice o da Tribunal'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'join hands under em now'<br>
Kayler takes Askaria's hand.<br>
Askaria holds Kayler's hand.<br>
Oxesiess says, 'Askaria I's da Oxes in da Tribunal's sight'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'give ya's Kayler my personal Hero fer... well a long time'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'to bashy at yer side'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'In adventures from now on'<br>
Oxesiess says, 'da End'<br>
Siegorny claps happily for Kayler - hurray!<br>
Benjiyardo cheers.<br>
Siegorny cheers at Askaria.<br>
*lots of congratulations, dances and fireworks provided by the casters that were present*
<br><br>
I think this is the largest sacrifice Oxesiess has ever made in her life.  Being a party to it in the first place was bad enough for her, but being the leading and BINDING person for giving her Hero to another forever was completely overwhelming.  Considering Kayler's words from a week ago, I cannot help to think that few authors could have orchestrated a more twisted plot for two characters.  That one's first love who still had a strong place in the heart, who looked up to you as a Hero, would marry you off to another and it all developed… through role-play over a long period of time.
<br><br>
Oxesiess will never be able to make the Sun drop from the Sky, or cause North Karana to go barren like Ro, but that day she did do something else that effected someone's "world" in a way that I can't help but think it a lot more important than all of that.  For as Oxesiess turned to leave Kayler told her, "Oxesiess, yer now MY hero".
<br><br>
