<B>Please Note:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest. We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game. This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only. Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I use a macro program in EverQuest, so I can macro a specific skill over night?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear lord, please tell me this is a joke. This is not Ultima Online, so please do not attempt to ruin a wonderful gaming environment by trying to abuse the system. There are no macro programs for EQ, and any use of external "cheat" programs is considered illegal and can result in banning.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is EQ still worth buying for people looking for a challenge? I've heard that some people actually got to level 40+ but Verant said it should take a year to get to that point. Has something changed or are these people who have yet to log off for the first time? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are putting in some serious hours, and likely not enjoying the scenery. Many people will play a game only to "win", so while you cannot win EverQuest, the level 50 goal is calling them. Who knows what they will do after that. The highest level players are those who have been in beta and know the areas and techniques. I believe Verant stated that level 50 should take a year for the average gamer, not for the die hard, Mountain Dew guzzling, red-eyed, hunch-backed, lock-yourself-in-your-room, pizza-ordering, what's-that-bright-yellow-thing-in-the-sky gamer.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was killed by ogres while running from bandits and never managed to get my corpse back as it was in the middle of the ogre camp.  I lost all of my stuff when my corpse decayed and now I am a poor beggar roaming the lands.  Since I have nothing, what things can I do to get "back on my feet?" Or am I doomed to start a new character? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;During beta testing, corpse and equipment loss happened relatively often.  In fact, every new phase of beta wiped our characters clean of all but the sparsest of cash. As such, it is safe to say that you can get back on your feet without too much trouble.  You will be able to earn cash faster than a newbie, and will be able to purchase your equipment more quickly than you did the first time.  It is better than starting over completely. You may also wish to group with some friends to adventure for some specific equipment that will aid in your recovery.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the Riposte skill Do?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If your parry skill has triggered and succeeded, your riposte skill will be checked. If it succeeds as well, your opponent's attack will be redirected back at itself, effectively giving you a free hit on it.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I determine what time it is in Norrath before I log on?  I really hate adventuring at night.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't. However, you can take these darkened hours as an opportunity to better explore a nearby city, which should be well lit. Discover the best place to buy ale, and hang out and chat with the locals. Seek out quests from the NPCs. On the other hand, you could just buy a good light source.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many pets can a necromancer or druid or magician have?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;One at any given time.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it mean when a spell requires level 61 to cast?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are spells that have been temporarily removed from circulation to fix problems with their effects. Since the maximum level is 50, placing the required level at 61 effectively makes it impossible to use, without removing it completely from the game. Thus, anyone who has previously scribed it into their spellbook will still have it when it is returned to circulation.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guy said "You're a jerk!" and told me I was going to be banned because he thinks I took his kill.  At first I did not believe him but he said he has talked to a GM before and the GM will probably ban me.  I didn't log on to EQ for 5 days because I was afraid when I did a GM would come and ban me..then I logged on once and logged back off.  Is it safe to enter EQ or should I erase my account and switch to Ultima Online?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safe to enter EQ. No one gets banned without first getting a warning for any improper behavior. I would highly doubt you would even get an official warning for what you describe. Never believe a player who threatens you with banning. Only a GM can make that decision, and you will know when you deserve that.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I somehow lost my note to be a player killer. Will I be able to get another note from another player, or am I stuck with a non player killer? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get a new note by talking to the Priest of Discord.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there the possibility for a warrior to combine dual wield and double attack to hit a target 4 times a round or to bash twice as fast?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a warrior can hit four times in one round if dual wield and double attack both succeed every time in that round.

Safe fall skill is not currently increasing through practice.
