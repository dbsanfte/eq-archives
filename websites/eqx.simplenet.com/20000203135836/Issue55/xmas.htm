Brownies roasting on on open fire <br>
Wasp Drones nipping at your nose <br>
Froglok tads, getting stuck in the mire <br>
And Homer, tromping on your toes 
<br><br>
Everybody knows <br>
An Ogre with some mistletoe <br>
Gives our Dwarf friends quite a fright. <br>
Tiny Trolls, with their eyes all aglow <br>
Will find it hard to sleep tonight. 
<br><br>
They know that Brad is on his way <br>
And all the Elves and Dwarves and Halflings <br>
Hope he'll say <br>
That he's got Ryan working overtime <br>
To make those boots really know how to fly. 
<br><br>
And so, I'm offering this simple song <br>
EQ designers, brave and true<br>
Though we're here for the test<br>
You deserve a long rest,<br>
Merry Christmas, to you!
