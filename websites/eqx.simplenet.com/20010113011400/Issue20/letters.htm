This is in response to <a href="../Issue19/succeed.htm">"Will Everquest Succeed?"</a>  and I couldn't
help but get in my two cents worth...
<br><br>
The PK switch - I believe that in the end this function will merely
provide sanctuary for players until they feel that they have risen above
newbie status. Eventually, unless you are heavily into merely chatting
and role-playing, the player is going to have to enter the fray to fully
experience the game. So even though you won't get wasted on your first
day in by some rampaging PK'er, how aggravating will it be to have built
yourself up to a comfortable level only to have the same thing happen
many many game hours later? Unless you're willing to devote yourself to
a lifelong commitment of associating will non-PK players only, the PK
issue is still alive and well.

Server Caps - I sang Sony's praises when I heard about this decision.
However, now that I think back on this, I realize that this could bring
up an annoying issue... what if you've found a server you like (either
for ping or attitude) and have settled in nicely, only to find that the
server is usually already at the cap when you logon to play? I'm curious
to know how Sony is going to deal with this...
<br><br>
The one consolation I have is the knowledge that Sony is the sort of
company that focuses on quality, and if anyone can do it they can.

btw - great job on EQX, I just finished catching up on all the back
issues.

I just finished catching up on my reading of EQX.  Of particular interest was Issue
16's article: <a href="../Issue16/beta101.htm">Beta Testing 101</a> Article by Wynn
Orill. This article was an outstanding guide for all upcoming Beta Testers for EQ.
Sadly, the disappointing failure of UO was caused in no small part by the lack of the
developers to continue beta testing the game before final release.  Of no less
importance was the failure of many players to adequately test the game, rather than
using the Beta as an opportunity to play the game before charges were implemented.
Wynn has an excellent point that WE the Beta Testers for EQ will have a profound
impact on determining the future success of the game.  He brought up points that I
had already considered in my thoughts about the Beta, but he brought up many that I
hadn't even dreamed of!  I urge you to seriously consider running this article again
(perhaps many times!)  Especially as we receive word that the Beta has, or will soon,
begin.  I don't have to stress the importance of good solid Beta testing to most of
the EQ community, but perhaps everyone can learn a little more about what a good Beta
Tester should be trying to accomplish.  More importantly, those who will be new to
Beta Testing will certainly gain a great deal of insight into what their role in the
Beta should be.  Keep up your fine work.
