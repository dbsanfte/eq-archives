   Jeff awakens.  He's a bit tired having stayed up till 3am playing Unreal the night before.  He rolls out of bed and grabs a folded pair of slacks, which were neatly placed atop a shirt, a pair of socks, and a fresh pair of underwear.  Everything was meticulously laid out in preparation of a new day.   He finishes getting ready and heads into the kitchen.  He pulls up a chair and sits down at the table.  In the center of the table is a computer terminal.  He punches a few commands on the keyboard, as the screen comes to life.  Things begin to happen throughout the kitchen.  The coffeepot starts to brew, as the aroma of fresh coffee starts to fill the room.  He loads his IRC client and joins channel #Windows, #Linux, #MIRC, #IRCHELP, and #Geniuses.  He pours a cup of coffee and begins to watch the scroll in each channel, which he has no problem keeping up with.
<br><br>
After finishing breakfast he heads into the study.  He sits at a huge desk, neatly organized with various computer equipment.  He pulls out the keyboard from below the desk and authenticates with his screen saver.   Again he logs onto IRC and joins his usual channels.  After loading IRC he minimizes the screen and loads his Tunnel client to connect with his office.   First he checks his email, then his appointment calendar.  He makes a mental note of his schedule for the day.
<br><br>
"Incoming chat request."
<br><br>
"!@#$%^" he shouts.  "What the heck its only 8am!" he adds, looking down at this watch.  He clicks on ICQ to find out who was interrupting his morning agenda.  Its someone named ICKY.
<br><br>
"Oh man what does he want now!" he says out loud as he accepts the request.
<br><br>
ICKY:  Dude you have to see this.  This nudy site is the best I've ever seen!
<br>
ICKY:  http://www.Imnottellingyoumynudysiteson.eqx/Absor.would.kill.me.com.
<br><br>
Jeff cuts and pastes it into a file he calls "Notes.txt" He'll save that little number for later.
<br><br>
Jeff: What else do you want? I'm kinda busy.
<br><br>
Icky starts to type some long boring sentence about his cyber sex chat he had last night.  Jeff minimizes the screen and loads Mplayer.  Occasionally he flips back to the ICQ chat session and types a "Cool" or a "Damn" then quickly flips back over to anything more interesting to him.  Nothing happening on Mplayer so he loads GameSpy and looks for a familiar site for Unreal.  He felt he needed another game to redeem himself from the pounding he took the night before.  
<br><br>
Not having found anyone he liked he loaded up his browser and surfed a few sites.  Twenty minutes later, he hears an annoying sound.   "Ahoooooooooooga!"  He flips over to the ICQ chat session.
<br><br>
ICKY: Hey I'm talking to you, you jerk.  
<br><br>
Jeff:  Um sorry dude.. Phone rang
<br><br>
ICKY: Oh.. Well look back at what I typed.
<br><br>
He flips back over to his web browser and continues to read.  
<br><br>
Two hours pass and Jeff starts to feel hungry.  He looks at his watch, its noon.  He picks up the phone and dials.   A voice answers.
<br><br>
"High Cholesterol's Pizza, can I take your order?"
<br><br>
"Yea Id like to order a large pepperoni pizza with mushrooms and onions, and sausage, and green peppers."  He says as his stomach grumbles.  "Yea and four two liter mountain Dews."  He added.
<br><br>
Having placed his order, he heads back into the study.  He checks his IRC channels.  Nothing interesting there.  He loads Game Spy.
<br><br>
"Oh cool Mega Death's Unreal Server."  He says as he joins the server, and begins to play.
<br><br>
Twenty minutes later the doorbell sounds.  Jeff answers the door; almost forgetting he had ordered the pizza.  Pays the delivery guy and takes the pizza into the kitchen and turns on the monitor.  While stuffing down pizza, he chats in various conversations on IRC.  After finishing the pizza he heads back into the study.  Checks his email, and looks at ICQ for new messages.  Nothing.   He tabs over to Unreal and continues to play.
<br><br>
Four more hours pass.  Jeff stops playing Unreal and heads into the kitchen.  He opens the phone book and begins to look under "Fast Food".  The phone rings
<br><br>
"Hello?"
<br><br>
"Hey dude its Dave.  You going out with us tonight?"
<br><br>
"Where ya going?"
<br><br>
"New Star Trek movie."
<br><br>
"No way.  Who's going?"
<br><br>
"Me and Fats, Dickey and Shmoe."
<br><br>
"Yea I think so.  Give me a call when you're leaving."
<br><br>
"Cool."
<br><br>
-click-
<br><br>
He finds something that pleases his stomach, and picks up the phone and dials.   A voice answers.
<br><br>
"Mel's Ulcers.  Can I help you?"
<br><br>
"Yea Id like to place an order for delivery."
<br><br>
"What you want?"
<br><br>
"Two Fat Boy subs and two large fries."
<br><br>
"What you want on them?"
<br><br>
"Everything"
<br><br>
"That will be fourteen dollars, and twenty minutes or less."
<br><br>
He hangs up the phone and heads back into the study.  
<br><br>
"Incoming chat request." The computer chirps.
<br><br>
"What the heck does he want now?" he says as he clicks on ICQ.  The name reads Redhead.
<br><br>
Red: Hey you home?
<br><br>
Jeff: yea how are you?
<br><br>
Red: Im fine.  Missed you last night.  Did you get my pic?
<br><br>
Jeff: No.  How did you send it?
<br><br>
Red:  ICQ
<br><br>
Jeff:  oh.  Send it again.
<br><br>
Red: I will later tonight.  You'll be on later?
<br><br>
Jeff:  Yea I'll be here.
<br><br>
Red:  Great.  Wanna meet on Mplayer again tonight?
<br><br>
Jeff: Sure.  Make a channel called Red.
<br><br>
Red:  cya then.
<br><br>
Jeff closes the session and checks his email and ICQ for messages.  Nothing.  He then loads Game Spy and finds another server worthy of his skill. 
<br><br>
Forty minutes pass and the door bell sounds.
<br><br>
Jeff opens the door.  Standing before him is a large man, with a cigar hanging out the corner of his mouth.  
<br><br>
"Fourteen dollars dude"
<br><br>
Jeff hands him the money and closes the door.  He heads into the kitchen and begins to eat.  
<br><br>
The phone rings.  
<br><br>
"Hey you going?"
<br><br>
"You're leaving now?"
<br><br>
"Yea were going to eat first at Hooters and then head over."
<br><br>
"Oh.  Naaa I'm going to pass this time.  I gotta hot date."
<br><br>
"Yea right.  Come on man you need to get out."
<br><br>
"Have fun dude." Jeff says as he hangs up the phone.
<br><br>
He finishes his meal and heads back to the study.   First he checks his email.  He then switches over to the IRC client and monitors his channels.  
<br><br>
After about an hour, Jeff loads Mplayer.  He looks for Redhead in the list of channels.  He finds her channel and joins.
<br><br>
To his amazement there are already two people in the channel.
<br><br>
Destroyer:  Who is that freak?
<br><br>
Red: Who Jeff?  He's just a friend.
<br><br>
Jeff:   Hey Red.
<br><br>
Red: Hi Jeff.  This is Destroyer.  I met him last night.
<br><br>
Destroyer:  Buzz off dude.  We are having a A, B conversation so C your way out of it.
<br><br>
Having moderator privileges, Destroyer removes Jeff from the room.
<br><br>
"What a jerk" Jeff mumbles, and logs off Mplayer.
<br><br>
He then checks his email.  Nothing.   He loads Game Spy to find another Unreal server.
