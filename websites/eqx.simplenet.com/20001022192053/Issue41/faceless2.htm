	The warm wind blew lightly across the waters' glistening surface causing ripples to spread throughout the path it flew.  The gust hastened across the opening of the massive lake and quickly found itself filtering through the tall mushrooms trees just beyond the water.
<br><br>
	Bulgar looked up at the small fire he built, watching the flames dance as the wind passed by.  The fires golden light reflected off his deep blue eyes.  His long, dark brown hair blew lightly in the path of the wind.  The comfort of the warm wind dwindled as it traveled further across the area known as the Mushroom Spires.  With its passing the flames of the campfire danced energetically, providing light for Bulgar to accomplish the task at hand.
<br><br>
	He looked down upon the parchment in his lap and considered what he would write in his journal.  The wheels of his mind began turning, so he quickly brought out a quill and started scratching in the days' entry.
<br><br>
<em>Warmmonth 3, 709 <br>
Day 2
  <br><br>
	Today's attempt at witnessing a Unisis failed.  I do however know that the horn I constructed will work if I just give it time.  I must have patience, for very few creatures have witnessed a Unisis.  With the rising of tomorrow's sun I will once again try to call Her.  This trip, two years in the making, will be glorious indeed.  For now, rest is essential.  Good night Antonica, may your mushroom and clover fields flourish throughout this beautiful evening.</em>
<br><br>
	Bulgar slowly closed the journal and placed it, along with the quill, in a pouch on his belt.  He closed his eyes and, for the first time today, let his mind relax.  The wind around the campfire died down leaving only the sounds of burning wood crackling in the night.  Bulgar stood up and reached for a vial of black liquid on his belt.  With his eyes still shut, Bulgar slowly pulled off the cork and let a gray mist escape the bottle.  Many words and letters of music raced through his mind.  He selected the correct ones and started to hum the arcane tunes.  The gray mist began swirling all around the camp, taking with it the smoke from the fire.  As it reached the edge of the campfires light, Bulgar placed the cork back onto the bottle.  He slowly opened his eyes and surveyed the area.  Satisfied that he would be protected this night, he lay down on an area of soft clovers and whispered, "goodnight".  Before the word even escaped his lips, his Shaman magic engulfed his mind and body into the needed brief hours of uninterrupted sleep.

	The black bird sat atop the lowest branch of the tree, surveying the campground below him.  The bird's eyes scanned the outer edges of the quiet campsite, sensing something out of the ordinary.  The bird turned his head to the sound of the dying fire and stared at the large body resting upon the thick patch of clovers.
<br><br>
	<em>Get closer my feeble friend.</em>
<br><br>
	The command sent the bird off the branch.  As the bird descended, he fought the urge to get too close to the sleeping human.  He wanted to cry out a loud chirp and break the control that was upon him, but he considered the consequences of waking the sleeping <em>groundwalker</em>.  The bird landed on a log across the now dead campfire and watched in fear.
<br><br>
  	The man before him slept in great peace and comfort among the soft clovers.  He wore many attractive colors compared to the deep green around him.  The bird paid close attention to the slow movement of the human's chest, rising and falling so rhythmically.  He peered at the face for some time allowing his controller to get a good look.  The birds gaze was broken as the large man moved his whole body rather quickly.  The bird flapped his wings in alarm and prepared to take flight when the words of comfort came to him.  <em>Do not be alarmed, you are not in harms way.  Stand your ground and search for the answers I seek.</em>
<br><br>
	The bird had never experienced a situation such as this.  So close to a <em>groundwalker</em> and understanding the words they speak as if they were part of his own consciousness.  He jumped down from the log, taking care not to land too close.  Each tentative step he took towards the man was tearing at his instinct to take flight, however, he stayed on the ground and was close enough to hear the loud breathing of the sleeping one.  The bird looked up and down the body, searching as he was instructed.  Beyond his control, the bird stopped searching and stared at an item strapped around the waist of the sleeping human.
<br><br>
	<em>I have seen what I am looking for little one, you cannot be of use to me anymore.</em>
<br><br>
	The bird waited until the words left his mind and then sudden fear overwhelmed him.  He cried out loudly and flapped his wings with extreme vigor, all the while hoping to escape this dire situation.
<br><br>
	 Bulgar quickly arose to the loud screech.  He placed his hands in front of him and began speaking the arcane language.  While Bulgar prepared the spell in his mind he began to assess the situation.  He watched as nothing more than a black bird ascended into the sky heading into the dark morning.  Bulgar quickly remembered his surrounding enchantment and tried to break it before the flying creature was harmed.  As his mind found the spell to disarm the protection he heard a terrified screech and knew that he was too late.  Bulgar called for light and a path was instantly illuminated.  He swiftly moved to where the sound came from, only to find a smoking and completely lifeless black bird, with its eyes wide open and full of terror.
<br><br>
	Bulgar spoke a Shaman prayer for nature and it's creatures.  He looked down at the pitiful animal and wondered why something so fearful and cautious would place itself in the danger that it did.  He considered it too peculiar to be curiosity.
<br><br>
	Bulgar headed back towards the campsite trying to detect anything out of the ordinary.  He felt a fading sense of magic in an area that was dreadfully quiet.  He reached the inanimate fire and untied a small pouch from his belt.  Bulgar pinched a small portion of black powder from within the pouch and threw it into the dying embers.  Flames shot up with such intensity that Bulgar barely got his hand away in time.  "I better use less next time or I'll be needing a new robe," he babbled to himself.  He securely tightened the pouch back to his belt and began searching for the day's breakfast.  Satisfied with a bag of fresh fruit, Bulgar sat on the log in front of the now energetic fire and consumed his morning meal.
<br><br>
	As he ate, Bulgar wondered what new events this day had in store for him.  Could this be the glorious day, a day to remember for a lifetime?  Or were the strange events of the lightless morning a warning of what was yet to come.
<br><br>

	Raze slowly opened his tiny black eyes and slid his long slender fingers off the scrying sphere.  He ran one of his hands through his jet-black hair, as he did so often out of a nervous habit.  He took a deep breath and shut his eyes again to relax his mind.  The small wrinkles around his eyes almost seemed to fade away as he exhaled.  So many images where flowing though his consciousness.  He saw dark green clover fields, the low glow of a dead fire, and an extremely peaceful man amidst it all.  He squeezed his eyes shut for more intense concentration, making wrinkles return around more than just his eyes.  Raze tried to focus and make sense of what he had just witnessed.  He experienced a slight terror, with the urge to give up and soar to the heavens.  Raze denied the cowardly act and focused on one item in particular, a large equipment belt that was strapped around the sleeping human.  On that belt were the answers that he was seeking.  The power that he had sensed, just moments ago, was enough to please even his second in command, Allure.  She would be pleased to know that he had located one of their master's most hated enemies and he wouldn't mind getting his hands on the source of the power that Bulgar possessed.  Maybe Allure would even reward him with her 'kiss of death' making him one of Cazic-Thule's growing undead army.
