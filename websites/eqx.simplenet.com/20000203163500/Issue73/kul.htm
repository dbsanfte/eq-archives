Rain dripped off my helm, and ran in slow trickles down my neck.  I don't think I've ever seen a rainstorm this strong in the Butcherbloks.  My companion Kakur and I had just arrived off the boat from Freeport, having ferried a human friend over to meet his new guildmaster.  Humans are an odd race, sometimes choosing to fight with hands and feet only, instead of donning good steel for protection and using axes and hammers.  Surprisingly effective, though I'm not sure how much good it would be against a drake.   All the prancing and jumping in the world won't stop that fire, it washes over bodies and really needs stout dwarven steel to stop it.
<br><br>
Our attempt at a rapid run from the docks to the walls of Kaladim became a slippery, muck-filled adventure, dropping us in seemingly cavernous holes in the road and sliding us down several hills.  Between the sea, the rain, and the mud, we were thoroughly soaked when we reached the city gates.  Even the hardy guards were tucked deep into the entrance tunnel, but that didn't stop them from snickering at our bedraggled and weary forms.
<br><br>
We stumbled into the Pub Kal, and dumped our packs into a side room.  Freezing though we were, we trudged to the closed Greybloom farms and entered the pool like we did when we were kids playing truant.  Soon all the dirt and grime was off us and we shivered our way into dry clothes and back into the Pub.
<br><br>
We dragged a table next to the fire and sat down, ordering hot food and mulled wine to warm ourselves.
<br><br>
"That fire should be hotter," Kakur grumbled.
<br><br>
Fire, and the thought of drakes and monks and dwarf steel all came together in a rush, and a thought came to mind.  "Did you ever hear the story of how Kul lost his axe?"
<br><br>
"No, but will it keep me warm?"  Kakur was always the cynic.
<br><br>
"Well, it kept Kul warm.  He survived the great dragons that day, but the loss of the axe was the price he paid for his victory."
<br><br>
"It was in the Age of Scale, when Veeshan's get were roaming the land, and the denizens of Underfoot were struggling to survive.  Dragons in those days were beings of great power, and lacked the wisdom which some acquired in later years.  They were greedy thugs, plundering everything they could, and one of the things they loved was the golden metal and brilliant gems that the Devlar were pulling out of the earth.
<br><br>
"At that time a few of the dragons had found Kaladim and had summoned their peers to come and try to plunder it.  The three or four original dragon's name are unknown, but they had attacked any dwarf foolish enough to venture out to the surface.  They had then tried to burrow into Kaladim, which was not the city of strong walls that you know today.  The Kaladim Gates were not yet built, and the entrance to Kaladim was no more than a roughly hewn cave entrance, created for those dwarves that wished, for some reason, to venture out to the upper world.  The dwarves were putting up a strong fight, and had killed two of the original group, when the Great Wyrm Vorheesh arrived.
<br><br>
"Vorheesh was the son of the First Dragon, who was Veeshan's offspring.  He was a huge, ebon-skinned dragon who had knowledge of the raw magic that pulsed throughout Norrath in that age.  Taller than an elf were each of his claws, and his eyes burned with a murky violet glow.   The scales of his armored hide were as big around as the pubs' door.  He was craftier than most, and he immediately set the other dragons to creating dragon-tunnels to enter into the vast halls of Kaladim.  Their first assault collapsed part of the area now known as South Kaladim, and dwarves died by the hundreds.  The dragons feasted on their bodies and squabbled over their share of the dwarven riches they discovered.
<br><br>
"It was then that Kul went to seek out Brell to get help, and received the Axe of Kul, a tale which I have recounted to you <a href="../Issue45/axe.htm">before</a>.  When he returned he had the Axe, and was prepared to fight the dragons for the mastery of the Underfoot.  
<br><br>
"Inside the cavern where the dragons slept and fought, there were two entrances where the dragons kept a constant watch.  One entrance the dwarves had caved in, and the other the dragons had piled some of the rubble from the ruins of that part of the city.  Kul knew that the only way the dwarves would succeed was to surprise the vast beasts, since their fiery breath would kill most dwarves in an instant.  There had to be a way to achieve surprise.
<br><br>
"Kul went to Devlin, the great delver of the dwarves, and asked him to set his people to the task of digging two tunnels into the cavern, but without making enough noise to rouse the dragons.  The tunnels had to be able to be collapsed in an instant, and to be broken through at the cavern end in less than a second.
<br><br>
"He then went to Dun, the smith who had forged the Axe, and asked him to make shields which could hold back the fire of the dragon's breath."
<br><br>
Kakur looked at me oddly.  "Hold back dragon's breath?  How could they do that?  If the shields were metal, they would heat up!"
<br><br>
I nodded.  "Dun knew that.  You know that dwarf in the fighter's guild who makes scarab items?"
<br><br>
Kakur nodded.  "I see those funny little hats around, green with horns.  The ones he makes for gnomes have a faceplate."
<br><br>
"He's one of the Dunnar, the smithing dwarves, whose family have handed down the secrets of using animal parts as opposed to metal.  Dun knew that metal would not work, unless it was magicked, and there was no time for the creation of magicked shields. He used the carapaces of the giant death beetle to make shields which resisted heat, but the dwarves killed so many death beetles that they are quite rare now, and only found in areas far from Butcherblok.  Occasionally you'll see a scarab scuttling about, but it's much, much smaller than a death beetle.
<br><br>
"But I digress.  When the Dunnar had made the shields for Kul and the other warriors, and Devlin had made the tunnels, the priests of Brell offered to help them with wards and blessings from Brell himself.  Kul, who had gotten the metal for the Axe from Brell, told the priests that they didn't need them!  "Brell has already blessed us, you meddling priests, and we will prevail without your help!"  Kul was always one for action before thought.  I think that it's from him we get our boastful pride."
<br><br>
"What boastful pride?"  Kakur looked at me straight-faced.  "We Dwarves were the only thing that held Faydwer from the Ogre invasions, and we defeated the drakes, right?  What's not to boast about?  What other race has done as much?"
<br><br>
I looked at my friend sadly.  "Elves have fought the orcs, and still keep them from really bothering us in Butcherblok - doesn't that count for something?  We don't have that enemy to deal with because the Elves have been fighting them for Ages..  We're all engaged in a struggle against Cazic-Thule and Innoruuk, we are all fighting for good."
<br><br>
"Right, and we are the best fighters in the bunch, that's all,"  Kakur insisted.  "What's your point?"
<br><br>
I sighed. "Well, in this case, here is the point:  Kul and the dwarves came racing out of the Devlar's tunnels and engaged in a fierce melee with the Dragons inside the cavern.  Since Kuldar surprised them, and the dwarves were able to swarm around the Dragons like ants on a piece of sugar, the Dragons were not able to battle without tripping over each other.  Finally, the greatest of them sent out a call to Veeshan herself.
<br><br>
"When Kul heard that the Mother of All Dragons had reached the coast of the Butcherbloks, he raced out into the Kaladim gates.  Armed with his Axe, and wearing the heat resistant scarab shield.  He stood there ready to defend Kaladim to the death.  The battle raged on inside the cavern, and Kul stood out there alone.
<br><br>
Veeshan swooped down and breathed her fire upon him, thinking him to be a typical dwarf guard.  To Kul's surprise, the complete power and heat of her breath went into the Axe!  Brell had enchanted it, not to fight dragons in general, but to fight Veeshan herself!  As the Dragon Mother repeated her attack, not believing that Kul was still standing, Kul felt himself bursting with strength, and the Axe was stuck to his hand like a live current was running through him.  As Veeshan began her third run, all the power of her two breaths, and the power of Brell surged from Kul's arm as he hurled it straight at her head!
<br><br>
It flew faster and straight than any arrow ever flew.  The force of the blow knocked Veeshan, who had been flying full speed at Kul, backwards into Dagnor's cauldron.  Kul ran to retrieve the Axe, but it was nowhere to be found.  Veeshan's body had disappeared, perhaps brought back to the plane of her birth.  If that's so, perhaps that is where it is today - stuck, somewhere in the body of the Dragon Goddess.
<br><br>
"By Brell!  Then it still exists?  Why didn't Kul go to find it?"  Kakur leaned over the table, his red beard bristling.  
<br><br>
"Because he never came back from the Cauldron.  Veeshan's brood took their revenge on him there, and alone, and with out the protection of the priest's magic, he perished.  Had he allowed a priest to come along, perhaps he would have lived, and the Axe of Kul would be wielded by King Kazon Stormhammer himself.  His arrogance doomed him, as it will perhaps doom our race someday.
<br><br>
"Had Kul not rejected the help of the priests of Brell, had he not coveted the Axe, had he not acted as if the Kuldar were the only important dwarves in Kaladim, then perhaps things would have been different.  As it was, Brell had warned him of pride, and in the end, Brell showed him the price."
<br><br>
I looked over to Tumpy, who had been steadily serving us spiced ale while I was telling my story.  He was washing up the mugs, getting ready to close for the night.  
<br><br>
"Hey Tumpy!  Do you still have those spare rooms next door?" I asked.
<br><br>
He nodded and replied "They're available tonight.  You two look like you could use somewhere dry.  Your clothes are still steaming."
<br><br>
I looked over by the fire and sure enough, our cloaks had not yet dried out.  "Well, ok then, we'll take them, and another pitcher of your ale to make sure we don't get a chill."
<br><br>
Kakur grinned at me.  "We could go see if one of those emerald drakes could heat us up!"  
<br><br>
I chuckled.  "Not without the Axe of Kul!"
<br><br>
Arm in soggy arm, we retired to a well-earned rest.
