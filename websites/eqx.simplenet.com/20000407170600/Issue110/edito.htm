<em>Oh dear.  It appears that what I meant as a <a href="../Issue109/edito.htm">gentle reminder</a> to look beyond items and statistics and levels was viewed by some as an attack on Paladins in general and the poster in specific.  I attribute this in part do a bit of writers laziness on my part, because I certainly did not mean to imply that, nor was it an attack on power-levellers and leveling - I'm not sure where that came from, but several folks mentioned it too.  Some people question my credentials a bit, some people lament the lack of RP environment, and some folks picked up on my main point and ran with it 
<br><br>
I thought the quality of Romidar's post was very high, and I praised his number crunching, incorrectly assuming it entailed a lack of role-playing. In his case this is not true, and I knew that from his other posts. Here are some comments:</em>

Greetings,
<br><br>
The post that Oghma commented on in issue #109 was mine, and I have a few responses. First, I chose to play a paladin before I bought the game because I love the idea of paladins. The idea of a holy knight who defends his party and GOODNESS in general until death has always drawn me. A class that has his god at the heart of his motivations has a strong appeal to me. I almost always played a paladin in AD&D in junior high and high school and any game that has paladins in it typically wins my dollar. For the first month or so, I was an RPer in the game and it angered me to no end to see paladins grouped with dark elves, shadowknights, et al. I frustrated my friends because I would NOT allow any of the dark 
races/classes into groups with me. I could do this because my friends, though they disagreed, allowed me the lattitude. My attitude begin to change by the time I hit my 20's for several reasons:
<br><br>
1) I had met too many dark elves, shadowknights, trolls, ogres, etc. who were nice people. They were polite and self-sacrificing. (One troll shadowknight risked life and limb to get a group of lower level of people out of the 3rd level of Befallen.) The few who DID role-play their race did so by speaking in troll-talk.
<br><br>
2) I had met too many people of GOOD races who were, well, dinks. Kill-stealers. Loot thieves. Rude. Obnoxious. That high elf paladin or erudite wizard was not even close to the quality of the troll shadowknight I just met.
<br><br>
3) When you reach higher levels (and by this I mean the relatively low level of 20 or 25), you can be less picky if you want to advance - especially if you are a melee class (i.e., paladins). You get into a group in Unrest to slay undead and, what do you know, there's a necromancer in the group. Leave the group and spend another hour, *literally,* shouting that you need a group? You don't have the luxury of doing this and it is also less appealing since the necromancer may be the nicest person in the group.
<br><br>
4) The things that Verant has paladins do completely break the suspension of disbelief for me and many other paladins. Kill a froglok paladin to get Ghoulbane? Kill faeries and gnome clockworks to get our Armor of Ro? Raise faction with the temple of Ro, devoted to a god who drove the elves from Tunaria/Antonica? You could say, "Oh, but that's a moral quandary given to paladins - you have to decide whether to do these things." If there were ALTERNATIVES to doing these things, yes, that'd be great - but there aren't.
<br><br>
At higher levels (say, 30+), it MATTERS what you can bring to a group. Your damage potential matters. Your strengths and weaknesses as a tank matter.I have 70+ days played time on my paladin alone. That's more than 1680 hours sitting in front of the screen playing him. My suspension of disbelief was broken a LONG time ago. The game's graphics still strike me sometimes (can't watch a bull elephant go trundling by without staring; watching a sunrise from atop the white bridge tower in North Karana is a lovely sight), despite this time. However, my role-play is reserved for very few situations:
<br><br>
-Meeting a stranger and talking with them for a few minutes (even that rarely lasts). <br>
-Talking to newbies/lowbies and buffing them... until they starting begging for items and platinum (you should experience going to the bank in your 40's). <br>
-I tend to die before letting another party member die. Lay hands is rarely used on myself. Can't help it. ;-) <br>
...<br>
Guess that's about it for RP situations.
<br><br>
I didn't pick a paladin or my race (blind human) because I wanted to be powerful. I have no illusions that I will be powerful at 50th level. Getting to 50th level, slaying some dragons and seeing the planes are the goals I have in front of me. I mainly play the game because I've met a bunch of good people that I really enjoy playing with. Some of these include dark clerics of Innoruk and dastardly shadowknights.
If you can maintain your suspension of disbelief, good for you. I, and most others, can't. EverQuest is Diablo on steroids. I had hoped for more, but it isn't there. I could go through a long list of problems that keeps it from being a good RP game: of the top of my head religions don't matter beyond being KoS and getting good prices; "evil" characters don't have anything "evil" that they can do; the world isn't dynamic so you never get a feeling of completion like you can in a P&P role-playing game or a singe player CRPG - kill Sir Lucan and he's back in 6 hours for someone else to kill. I wasn't aware and/or didn't care about these things at low levels.What irritates me about your editorial is that you have a problem with the "attitude" of players who feel this way. My gut feeling is that you haven't experienced a lot of what others have at high levels. Your comment about druids seems to indicate part of the problem - when you have played to high 
levels (and NOT just a long played time), you would have to blind to miss how the game works. If you can do a lot of damage in a short amount of time and can avoid taking damage in return, you are a POWERFUL class.
<br><br>
Your comment about not being a temporary visitor to Norrath strikes me. I've already mentioned my play time, and I'm sure I'll be around several more months at least. I played Diablo for more than 2 years. To some of us, getting more powerful (even if you are never actually powerful) IS a goal. When your forward advancement halts, the game stagnates and becomes frustrating. In the 40's people do not sit around RPing.
<br><br>
If you're having fun, then good for you (I really mean that). The fact that you could not have fun leveling and going after items does not mean that others can't or don't have fun doing that. If I weren't having fun, I would have left a long time ago, but I am still enjoying myself - just in a different way. If you honestly can't enjoy that, then I hope you never do get to higher levels.

I wanted to put in a response to Oghma's editorial in Issue #109 regarding excessive number-crunching as a substitute for gameplay. While I entirely agree with Oghma on all points, I feel the need to counter some of the broad  brush characterizations.I cannot speak for the Paladin that posted the analytical letter that inspired the editorial, but I have read many of his posts on the Paladins of Norrath message board. I feel he and others got a bad rap for 'talking numbers', implying that they're merely mini-maxing powergamers. Even Gordon, on another thread later that same day, encouraged players to just forget the numbers and enjoy the game. The vast majority of Paladins I have met in game or read while lurking on BBs chose to play Paladins exclusively for roleplaying reasons. The exact same sort of reasons Oghma espouses in 
the editorial. Paladins are a tough row to hoe, and are definitely not the powergaming material of choice.
<br><br>
You almost have to be a masochist to play a Paladin to the top, which I feel actually plays into the Paladin role in game. One Paladin posting in that same thread described his role as the hero who "steps into the gap" when all hell breaks loose, and the battle goes bad. Personally, in my role of Paladin, I get royally pissed if groupmate dies before I do. An arrogant attitude and often impossible goal, perhaps, but there's nothing like the bittersweet feeling of saving a groupmate by Laying on Hands a half-second before I myself am squashed into a gooey paste. As many of the Paladins advanced into the upper levels of the game, however, they found themselves unable to perform even the most basic functions of a tank when grouped with other fighters. Walking away from a really tough battle without so much as a scratch is embarrasing!
<br><br>
The Paladin who compiled those numbers only did so after finding himself unable to fufill the role for which he had chosen to play a Paladin in the first place. To prove to himself and others that they were not simply imagining things, research and analysis was performed on play logs. Only then were these numbers presented on the general gameplay board. If Oghma felt there was something missing from the analysis because roleplaying values were not expressed, all I can say is that there was an expectation of dismissal by Verant if presented anything less than a concise statement of hard facts. Its difficult to pretend to be a holy knight if the game engine cuts you off at the knees, and at some point EverQuest the game asks you to 
produce results.
<br><br>
Although number crunching mini-maxers seem to be everywhere, I feel they are a minority of the player population on the whole. They're certainly not going to go anywhere very fast playing a Pally, where patience is the essence of satisfaction. Even a true blue (or is that purple?) roleplayer can benefit from occasionally considering the numbers when the gameplay is not supporting the role. Ignorance is not always bliss.

I got the tone from your editorial that you lamented a lack of RP in the post from Romidar. Well here's why:
<br><br>
The issue was we wanted Verant to address with the Paladins was a failing of their ability to tank at high levels. This ties directly into the role and vision of a Paladin. It had to be demonstrated to Verant that this failing existed and that could ONLY be done with hard numbers.
<br><br>
I assume (possibly incorrectly) that you have no characters of the level inquestion that the paladin issues touched on (35+). That is neither good or bad, just a fact. But it does mean you have not experienced first hand the severe limitations paladins suffer at those levels.
<br><br>
Paladins are the warriors of the light, champions of justice, foes of evil and hero to the common man. They exist, unlike regular warriors, as holy combatants inspired by faith and touched by their deities with power to do good. At levels 1-35 they are quite well equipped to do this but at levels beyond this their ability to smite the foe frankly plummets. Plummets so badly that they turn from inspired warrior and holy crusader to ineffective secondary healer with melee power fractionally better than a clerics.
<br><br>
THIS is why we needed to make the numbers sound out. It was strictly a higher level problem, one that Verant CAN solve. RP and the lack or abundance of it is STRICTLY a player driven thing. No matter how good the program or how advanced the environment no one can make a player RP if they plain don't want to. Petitioning Verant to do so, I think you would agree, is ludicrous. That is why you say no RP content in the post. It wasn't anything Verant could help with in any way EXCEPT to change the skill caps that allowed a Paladin to try to remain  the hero he/she was since level 35 and before.
<br><br>
To lament Romidar's lack of RP statement is to ignore his literally HUNDREDS of posts on the Paladins of Norrath board that have covered both RP and Game mechanics.
<br><br>
I can understand your wanting to make EQ as good of an RP experience as possible, I do too. But it is my belief that to criticize Romidar's lack of inclusion of RP elements in his post is being  bit shortsighted. The RP reasons are well established and long debated among Paladins on the Paladins of Norrath board of which Romidar is a major and regular contributor.
<br><br>
Frankly the post he made was to get a change in the Game system. He was detailed and concise in his evidence and accurate in his information because that is what was needed to GET that change done. But take on afternoon and look at the PON's board messages and you will se WHY those changes were
needed. To BE an effective Paladin at levels 38+. We could not taunt monsters off others. We could not effectively use our secondary attacks. This led to those in out charge DYING and us being unable to stop it. NOW we may have a better chance to stop that. With an increase in skill caps we can maybe interpose ourselves in the line of fire at high levels again and be the savior, hero's and protectors of Norrath that Paladins are SUPPOSED to be.

First I would like to say that I really enjoy EverQuest Express! It was an article of yours on Roleplaying Racial Hatred that led me to start reading the paper. At the time I was starting an Erudite Paladin on The Tribunal Server (which was less than a month old at the time), and I really wanted to roleplay her. So I sought out information on the history of Norrath that I could blend into my Roleplaying Experience. She is now in her 37th season and I have no regrets chosing to Roleplay with her. Sure I have had to leave some groups because others don't roleplay and they invite an evil character (a necromancer to use an example), but I never have hard feelings as I know not everyone chooses to play the way I do. I have still come a long 
way even with Roleplaying and I look at it as a fun challenge to add to an already wonderful game. And I want to thank you for all the wonderful articles you have written that have added to my enjoyment of 
Everquest. 
<br><br>
Sorry for rambling there. &lt;Chuckle&gt; Basically what I wanted to say in response to your Editorial which mentioned the list of statistic comparisons between a Paladin Character and a Ranger Character. I'm 
sure you know this article was done by Romidar who used himself (a Paladin) and his real life wife (a Ranger) as examples. Romidar is a regular poster on the EQ Stratics message boards. He may post often on other boards, but that is the main one that I read. I have read posts by him many times where he talks about his enjoyment of playing a Paladin, and playing the game, and how no matter what he would never stop playing his Paladin because the character is who he is, helping people and doing good. For the particular post that you wrote this editorial in response to, he was just trying to lay out cold hard statistics so that Verant, Gordon, or whoever would be dealing with the issue, would not have to wade through personal feelings or a listing of what all Romidar loves about his Paladin. He was basically trying to get right to the point of the issue at hand. I know that when I read the post I thought it quite long and I know that Verant has hundreds if not thousands of issues to deal with on a consistent basis. So to me the fact that he left out all the other reasons for playing his Paladin, or how much he enjoyed the game, was a good thing. And it allowed the issue at hand to be read and thought about for just what it was, a statistical comparison of two 
classes. 
<br><br>
I myself would never pick a character for their statistics. I also know that Verant themselves want this game to be ever evolving. So, I leave the statistical data to those who want to deal with it, and I just continue to have fun playing by beautiful, yet very tough , Erudite Paladin. I expect changes to happen, but I trust Verant to make the right choices for what those changes should be. We always get an answer from the Gods, even if it is not the answer we want to hear. &lt;smirk&gt; 
<br><br>
Thank you again for your hard work and your wonderful articles. I look forward to reading them and the rest of Everquest Express for a very long time! May your journeys be exciting and your victories many!

<em>Roleplaying Impossible</em>
<br><br>
Your editorial about the Paladin/Ranger comparison was very good. However, lately it seems like the only thing "astounding" in EverQuest is the players. I used to be a role player... I tried very hard to maintain my "in character" personality. EQ, however has done little to help me... and the "typical player" on my server has actually shown that my efforts are not appreciated. I play a Druid, and as such I get a LOT of in game requests... even for things I am not capable of thanks to the /roleplay flag making me anonymous. Yes, it is nice to admire a sunset, gape at a new monster, or joke around with an NPC... but how do you maintain that immersion when Superone the Dwarven Warrior runs up and says "sow plz"? Sure, the first few times it is fun... I have hit a lot people with pigs, responded in elven so they could not understand me, look at them in puzzlement, etc, etc. But after the 100th or 200th or 500th time, the environment begins to slip. When you realize you are in a minority in treating EQ as a role playing game, it becomes hard to maintain the environment. Now I usually just cast the spell on them without saying a word so that they will go away... I have had too many people continue to bug me. And wow... try to play some racial tendencies and see how far you get. I bet I am on numerous Dark Elf "hate" lists for not helping when they expected it. (I did run into one that roleplayed, but missed it among all the other /tells I was trying to handle 8( ) How about trying to fulfill my role as protector of the wilderness... try to stop people from killing animals... yeah right, and get yelled at for charming or fearing the thing they are trying to get experience from. The population on my server (at peak time) has jumped by more than 500 in the past three months and was 2000+ for the first time last night. This only makes matters worse as the crowding makes everyone ruder and more competitive for the limited resources in the game.What does all this have to do with statistics? Well, once the environment fails... once the role playing is no longer the primary part of the game, what are you left with? Levels, Camps (and long ones at that!), Experience, Equipment... and maybe, just maybe, friends you have made. In game friends and good groups are the only thing keeping alot of role players around. (those few that I know anyway) I think the point of the Paladin's post actually stemmed from a role playing concern. Paladins are supposed to be Holy Warriors... protectors of the weak and healers of the sick. I do not play a Paladin, but I can only imagine his frustration at not being able to accomplish those things even after role playing them. How much fun is it to charge into battle to try and save someone, only to find the monster ignores you almost completely? I think he used statistics to prove his point about the short comings of Paladins... I would not necessarily assume that he chose or plays his character according to that.Unfortunately, there is no good way to fix the environment. Reducing the crowding might help, but I do not think that will happen. It used to be 1200, then it was 1500, now they say 1800 is optimal... I can only assume that because the expansion will add several new zones, the optimal population will suddenly become +/-2100. For me, EQ has failed as a role playing game... but not solely because of the players, the design/use of the game itself does not reward the behavior. One only needs to look at the very low number of dynamic events to realize this. Those few that were run on my server degenerated into massive killings that made little or no use of role playing. Perhaps the game has just worn out for me... but I did take a month and a half away from it before the holidays... but it did not make the game any more fun. With the crowding continuing to spiral unchecked, I have opened up an Asheron's Call account as an alternative. Even less role playing over there of course, but I think my role playing is going the way of the dinosaur. Perhaps someday there will be a game that can foster the type of environment that was born in late night AD&D sessions among friends. It is very hard for an electronic game to come close to that, but they all claim to be "role playing" games. But EQ has not accomplished that, no matter how much they intended it or what "vision" they had for it.

<em>I'm a Roleplayer, and I think everyone else must play like me</em>
<br><br>
Oghma, my problem with your view is that it is from a hard-core roleplayer perspective, and even then, how do you classify a proper way to roleplay a static game like EQ? When I first joined this game, I had high hopes that this would be an immersive RP environment, where things were dynamic, and what you did could change others, but it's not. To me, it is pretty much a slow-motion first-person shooter.Are you playing on a PVP server? This may be a fantasy world, but here I am, a Non-PVP Paladin, I team up with dark elves, I barter with an Ogre, some guildmates are trolls, I kill things that do no harm to be in order to 'quest'… can you really say this is roleplaying? I do beautiful Paladin quests like Soulfire where I rid Lucan and get my holy sword, yet I'm forever banned from West Freeport? I thought I was a hero? Why does Lucan respawn after I just slayed him? My group of 30 brave people killed a dragon that terrorized the land for centuries, but I hear him roar in the dungeon again.
<br><br>
Sure, I do things like buff newbies, pass out some decent equipment to strangers, watch the sunrise, but I also enjoy the game acquiring items to make me an uber-tank, analyzing the power of the Ranger, camping an item for hours on end. I'll be here playing this game for years to come, and I know I'll enjoy it the way I play it just as you do yours.

Hi there, 
<br><br>
Read your post and although you are clearly a roleplayer I find your comment on "missing the point" a little unfair. The point to you is obviously Heavier on the role play side of EQ. Another's "Point" might be the kick someone gets out of a fun social with friends, crack some jokes, compare the advantages of Graphics cards / other games / PC's / Cars or what you may have whilst running around having fun killing stuff. 
<br><br>
Personnaly I am a 42 Paladin and the only quests I have ever done were Soulfire and various armour of Ro pieces. I did not even enter the role play frankly...just siffed through the important parts and acted on them. 
If there were truelly "FUN" quests I would do them for the entertainment / roleplay value, but unfortunately sitting down waiting for a spawn for 40+ hours (as so many items for their own sake or for quests require) is not what I call entertainment. 
<br><br>
Who is to say what the point is except the player themselves??? Surely the beauty of EQ is that it can be what you make out of it. Very much as life.....the road choice is yours. Does a musician play only one style of music?? No yet each camp will berate the other, and not just classical vs Pop or Rock vs Modern Age. Even within a catagory ie Pop...u get Rap vs Boy Band etc..... 
<br><br>
I know few Paladins who are not altogether "Good" and will die gladly for their party, I believe my supporting role is very much part of the character of my Paladin and in that sense if one does not fill the shoes intended they are frankly going to be an inneffective contributor to the party...ie a cleric that goes all out for AC and fights then wonders why he gets a mouthfull from the tank that just died without a single heal. Granted that is in lower levels but I have seen it happen. 
<br><br>
Romidar (The Paladin you talk about) has proven to the entire EQ community (whether they know its him or not) that all stats are pretty much useless for a tank and that AC is the way to go. This is not 100% of what EQ is about but surely one can only be commended for such contributions and not critiseced. 
I think a popular view of us that grace our monitors for many hours is that we are pretty sad lonely people and if adult we should grow up and "Get a life". Well the fact is this is what I choose to do with my time, I enjoy it, I have friends on line, we get on, have a laugh and is frankly more entertaining than watching TV all the time. This does not stop the general population from thinking we are a little weird. I think it fair the same comparison can be made in Norrath.....who is to say what style of play is wrong or right? 
<br><br>
Personnaly I hope whatever your level of role play / Item hunting / Merchant status you wish to obtain good luck to you...in the end Norrath is a place where you can be what YOU want and not what you are dicated to be by the populace through a profession or social peer pressure. 
Just my 2 coppers worth :)

<em>Some people got past my comments about Paladins and grooved on what I really meant</em>
<br><br>
I just read your editorial about how you pick characters and I love how well written it is... I feel like I'm there watching Everquest as a visitor in a new world when I play and you describe in your artical how I believe it should be. I admit that I have compared stats on the characters I have played but I didn't hate them for what they lacked. I choose characters the same way you described and I play like you described. It has taken me almost a year to get Kaediyan and Zhaneel just to their mid teens because I am always too distracted from hunting by the wonders of norath. Keep up the good work 
<br><br>
I read your editorial in issue 109, and I can say that I completely agree. I've played EQ since day one, and I have never leveled a character passed 12. I've gotten a few of my other friends addicted (their gf's hate me now) and I've noticed with them also this fascination with numbers, equipment, and *gasp* powerleveling. I did get sucked into it for a week or so, but after reading your article I sat back and realized what I was doing. I had lost that sense of wonderment that I experience upon first logging on into Ak'Anon, and the first time looking up to see a barbarians navel. I'm rambling now, anyway, Thanks for a great article and a great site!

Thank you Thank you thank you. The realization has set in over these past few months that EQ has begun to be quite the quagmire of stats and effenciency ratings between classes and races. I myself am, and I think 
always will be, a character player as are you (It would seem) I do not play for the stat value. I don't make this character JUST because that race of class would be better on mana later down the road. But then, I have really gotten tired of EQ because there's nowhere to go off the game to read anything that isn't suffused with info about statistics. But then, again Oghma shows me the light. Thank you for the uplifting editorial, as always.  Please, keep up the fight with Your dwarf and your little Gnomette. Please don't let the numbers ever get you, they are always there.
<br><br>
Well good points were made in your letter, I must say. I too, all though I dont like to think of myself as a "quake"-player, find myself camping out npc's for items or whatever they drop. Infact Ive stayed away from EQ all together since the last of November just because of what you so eloquently put: camping, looting, camping, looting. I just could'nt find anything interresting about the game, AT ALL. So, we've passed Y2K, and a friends ask me to logg on and assist him in some pressing matter (camping a named high lvl mob), and being the friend I am, I help him out. Then the race was on again: camping, looting, camping, looting. There you have it. Just thought I would get this off my mind. We've discussed this issue in our guild, but theres nothing to be done with it in the long run, one can only find a remedy that last for a very short time.
<br><br>
Anyways, we're trying to think of something to make our EQ-day more fun, but so far no luck. :)
<br><br>
Feel free to drop my our server, and say hello. As a pen-and-pencil rpg'er (AD&D, Rolemaster) we could work something nice out.

<em>I am very flattered that so many people took time to write such long and well-thought out replies to my editorial.  I didn't mean to imply that Romidar or the Paladins in general were a bunch of number-crazed power-gamers, but in retrospect I did.  Paladins received a lot of help in the last patch, and it is because of thoughtful, articulate posts like Romidar's that this came about.  Playing a Paladin is a labor of love, and now maybe your gameplay will reflect your vision of how it should be.
<br><br>
As far as my credentials to write about Paladins or high-level play, I think I am uniquely qualified.  I have written articles on EverQuest for two years now, and even wrote one specifically on the class <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue36/paladin.htm">http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue36/paladin.htm</a>.   I have played every class, some to their 30's, since beta, and think I know a little bit about playing an under-powered class - many of the spells and items in the game now were not even in the game during beta. My very first character in EQ was a bard, and they didn't even have most of the songs yet.  From the beta, and from final, I have many friends who have taken their characters to level 50 and have even on occasion logged in as those characters to see the world through those eyes, and I talk with them about issues unique to their high level.

As far as being a liberal flower hugging role-player, I think I am, a bit.  But I'm also a mean power-gamer when I want to be.  Posy is now 25th after nine days of /played time - even with taking time out to smell the flowers.  While this is not a world's record, it's certainly pretty good.  I am an on again-off again powergamer usually, because I like to set a goal, reach it and then goof off for a bit.  What I worry about is when the item/level stuff gets in the way of my enjoying the game - by camping too much, or sticking around the same place too much, or worrying that I'm not leveling fast enough.
<br><br>
What the thrust of my editorial should have been was this:
<br><br>
 ItemStatCampQuest is driven by the belief that your play is pointless if you don't spend all your time getting items. It drives the guilds that want to twink lower level members and therefore camp good items for <b>days</b> in-game.  It drives the newbies who beg for "sow, d00d", and "U got eny plat?"  The other day in-game a character mis-hit a hot-key a few times thinking they were on a different number pad and I was amused when the hot-key was an ooc call for cash and items. Had I been that player, I would have been mortified.
<br><br>
It also causes people to stay in specific places in the game, and not leave them.  Why go somewhere new and risky when you can be next to folks who can save your bacon and who can help you get that item.  What are the rewards for blazing new ground if you won't find a kewl item at the end?
<br><br>
Part of this ItemStatCampQuest is due to the belief that there is an all-powerful class/race combo - some items are only usable by a class. You must play that class to get the items.  Add into the mix the experience penalty some classes get and the different stat bonuses and you have players like some friends of mine who get a character to level 30 and then dump them and re-do the same character with a higher dex, or int.  Paladins in general, and Romidar, aren't that type of player <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>.
<br><br>
Several folks wrote in and bemoaned the lack of RP environment - whether it was from players who talk out-of-character or quests that seem to break the RP feel of a class.  As my friend Morgaelin says "BAH"- why should you have to kill a mermaid to get Raincaller, the best Ranger bow? Doesn't that seem a bit out of character? Paladin quests do similar things, as some of the replies mentioned.
<br><br>
Oxesiess and I talk about this issue a lot, and our solution has been to just ignore it.  A completely immersive experience would require that everyone playing has the same role-playing goals and role-playing skills - and it's just not going to happen in EverQuest.  We do much like Romidar mentioned in his letter - we pick our RP battles.  We role-play our characters as much as we can, usually on meeting someone new or playing with others who enjoy role-playing, but we also ignore those non-RP elements that creep in.  My druid, when I played her, just sowed people if she had the mana - it's ultimately less aggravating.  It is not the best solution, but it is one that works for us.  We have fun with the power-gamers, and fun with the role-players.  As far as questing - well, do what you think best - if you need to get that item, and you may be in genuine need of it, then you have to balance the continuing enjoyment of your character with the out of character actions needed to get that item.  Morgaelin will probably never get Raincaller, because he firmly believes he shouldn't pay that price.  I doubt that it will cause him to dislike being a Ranger, however.

I included this letter last, since it's not on the main focus of the editorial.</em>
<br><br><br>


Firstly, let me state that I am familar with your works pertaining to EQ and secondly that I am a role-player. However some of what I have to say does not pertain to role-playing. This e-mail is in response to your editorial in issue 109 of EQX. In you said, and I quote "<em>I want to commend Verant for hiring Abashi and giving him the discretion to comment and respond to players concerns. He is doing an excellent job</em>" with no offense to your views, this is bullshit. I play a Teir'Dal necromancer and as such have done some research into necromancers in general. 
<br><br>
One of the best necro only sites I've found was http://www.eqnecro.com/ this excelent site keeps a vary clear head on most issues; however one issue in particular that constantly upsets the necro minority is nerfing. Of all the classes in EQ necros are the most nerfed. This, however is not what I want to talk to you about. What I want to talk to you about is the constant cover-up of these nerfings by Abashi, from the rest of the EQ community. 
<br><br>
The following are discriminating issues cliped from eqnecro.com that Abashi has talked about- 
<b>8:34 a.m. - Reionik</b> This is not a test, I repeat this is not a test. We have been nerfed, yes my friends we have been nerfed. 
<br><br>
Ok even though Abashi asked our opinion and even though the no-nerf outweighed the nerf (thanks eveyone for posting). We got nerfed. Here is Abashi's new post.
<br><br>
After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer's Feign Death tactic, as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we are leaning heavily in the direction of making a change. As we would like everyone to understand why we feel this change is necessary, our Lead AI Programmer was kind enough to summarize our position: 
<br><br>
Problem:
<br><br>
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances, providing offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability to remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility. Offensive tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw verses the effect. Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself. As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could. This situation is well beyond what would preserve game balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example). 
<br><br>
Example:
<br><br>
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk. The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead. To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms the other. When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns. The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord returns to its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again. The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed. When the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the necro collects his special items. 
<br><br>
Solution:
<br><br>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want, however, to adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree. What we do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key spawn points. Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm. However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does. 
<br><br>
This change will be live on the Test Server when it comes back up. Baring any problems, and assuming that we have not missed anything, these changes should go live in the next patch. Please feel free to comment on our new solution further. We'll review your opinions again before making the final decision to implement it on the live servers.

Just to let you all know I have no plans to write Abashi again. He has insulted my intelligence for the last time. He is really going to have to anger me to get another post out of me because obviously its a waste of my time. For all interested here is my happy reply to him. If you want to post on his message here is the link click here
<br><br>
Ok Abashi this again is Reionik from www.eqnecro.com. 
<br><br>
Why did you even ask our opinion? Its just like I said you wanted to guage how many people you would piss off. I am simply amazed how completely clueless you think we are sometimes. You sit up there and make your little post to make it seem that you and/or your company for once actually care about what the user thinks. Now I see that was complete ****e. I went through all the responses to your last post and the no-nerf highly outweighed the nerf, but you decide on your own that it is effecting gameplay. Why even bother asking what we thought? Were you hoping the majority would say change it so you could say the nerf was brought about by the players? Well your plan didn't work and you have been exposed as the fraud that you are. I am so tired of you and Verant insulting our intelligence. Give us a little credit.
<br><br>
In site news. I am almost done with all the equipment guides. I am so sick of looking at equipment stats =). I think it will go live tomorrow. Everything accept the jewelry sections should be complete. I will keep all you little necro-fiends posted. Walk in darkness and duck from the nerfs.
<br><br>
This obveously shows that Abashi and Verant don't care what we necros think. Not only this but Abashi atempted to hide this nerf from the general populace of EQ by saying they let us vote on it. They had hoped the majority would side against us necromaners, but when they didn't Verant went on with their nerf anyway! The policy of Verant seems to be that somting is a class specific strategy untill someone complains. Then it's a bug which must be fixed ( read nerfed). If the above is not enough to prove that Abashi is a lier then read the following; a previous article from eqnecro.com pertaining to necro's pets.
<br><br>
<b>8:34 a.m. - Reionik</b> Greetings my little Necro-Fiends. You would think Abashi would give me atleast one day of me not having to write in the forum, but ... no. Here is his latest post.
<br><br>
This is a piece of a message from Malefic from the test server. 
<br><br>
Why doesn't Verant enhance Necromancers with a Variation of pets like Mages have. Mages get 4 pets to choose from, each with unique abilities. This is very conveniant to independance in the world, and also lends to being desirable to a group. Now I am not saying that Mages are overpowered or underpowered. And YES I am jealous that they get pets that look different, and have different abilities. WHY? It lets the Mage form a personality. Why not give this ability to the Necromancer?
<br><br>
Here is Abashi's reply
<br><br>
Though your ideas are certainly well thought out, this issue was actually considered a while back. Magicians are supposed to be the master summoners. That is why they get multiple pet types that can adapt to the situation at hand. As I'm sure you will agree given your note about being jealous, class distinction is a commodity, and the ability to summon different pets is one commodity owned by the Magician. Not to mention, I shudder at the idea of making Necro pets any more powerful. 
<br><br>
There is something that Necro's get, that's the ability to arm their pets. 
<br><br>
-Gordon
<br><br>
Here is my reply to good ole Abashi.
<br><br>
I agree with you on one point. Yes the magician is supposed to be the master of summoning. Wherein he/she should be able to cast a variety of elementals. 
<br><br>
Now onto the necro. Are we not supposed to be the master of the undead? Should we not have the ability to raise multiple types of undead? I would gladly exchange the ability to arm my pet if that meant he would be able to root or cast a damage spell. 
<br><br>
You said you shutter to think about making necro pets more powerful. Indeed the necro pet is a powerful beast. I will not stand here and say otherwise, but Abashi have you seen a magician pet lately =). 
<br><br>
Example 1 : At level 30 with intensify death casted on my pet and my pet was armed with a fine steel dagger and a fine steel rapier. My pet lost straight up to an 30th level magician's air elemental pet. Barehanded my pet lost 8/10 times. 
<br><br>
You shutter to think about making necro pets more powerful... /laugh abashi
<br><br>
That is all for now. I will be working on the equipment guide today. Speak with you all later.

This is obveously bullshit. Even if Verant is trying to "balance" the classes it seems they fail to equate the terminal social stigma of a necromancer. The fact that we can't buy food in our home towns goes a long way to justify a powerfull pet. It seems Varent is taking the good without the bad. As to the issue of balancing the clases why do we choose a class in that creation screen if they're all the same. I would like to hear your thoughts on these issues.
<br><br>
email me at: rdackerman@att.net <rdackerman@att.net>
<br><br>
P.S. As to the roleplaying issues at hand arent necros suposed to be evil outcasts whome are given great power in return for spurning their kind? 

<br><br><br><br>
<em>Actually, your letter disturbs me.  You seem to take any changes as a personal attack on you and necros in general.  The change discussed addressed what was a bug in the way monsters viewed a Feigned character, which some players took advantage of and were able to do things which they shouldn't.  You also sound rather paranoid, accusing Abashi and Verant of hiding changes, when in reality they have become more open about changes since Abashi started.  Your statement that you are a role-player sounds hollow in face of your ranting about a minor, and needed, change.  Game changes are rarely, if ever, put to a vote (this would mean that every class would be changed to an uber-class, don't you think?), though you attack Abashi by claiming he lied about asking for input and framed it as a vote.
<br><br>
You sound very upset with Verant and Abashi, and I'm not sure if I were you I'd continue playing.  It seems to cause you a lot of unhappiness.

<br><br><br>

To all of you who responded - thank you!  I will make my points better in the future, I hope, without unintentionally sideswiping an entire class <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>.
<br><br>
Have fun, play safe, and give all ur l00t to Posy and Oghma, dewd.</em>
