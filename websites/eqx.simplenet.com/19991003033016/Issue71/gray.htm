The Adventure of Graywolf  the Druid and Ranger Argyle: Spider Mayhem
<br><br>
(Note: These tales shall chronicle the true life adventures of Graywolf the Druid in the World of Norrath.  The following tale comes after some of his basic training as a Druid and is an excerpt of an adventure he had with a remarkable half-elf Ranger named Argyle.  Earlier chronicles of how I became a Druid and my adventures with some other notable heroes such as Tigerstarr, Pigdog, Wiggle and Phuntaire I shall endeavor to publish time permitting.  My guild is a demanding one and I often spend many hours wandering the woods and plains protecting not only the wildlife but the people as well.  I am always ready to help out when needed although I frown strongly on poachers and wolf killers and will not aid those who harm my brothers)
<br><br>
Before I begin the account of my adventure with Ranger Argyle on the wind swept plains of Karana and the escapade we had with a rather large and nasty spider, I wish to mention briefly how we met.  One rainy day whilst fishing on the docks  at the small lake in Surefall Glade, I noticed a young ranger fishing nearby and being somewhat bored with all the fishing I started up a conversation.  I had always found fishing to be a great way to earn extra money for spells and supplies as well as giving me food to eat while out on missions for my guild.  Another benefit was that it gave me the chance to meet many of the new people who were always visiting the Glade for one reason or another.    So while I stood casting my line into the rain splattered water I asked the young half-elf how the fish were biting today.  Argyle commented that more often than not he seemed to catch rubbish then fish but that he had done well that day and was hoping the merchant would give him a good price for his catch.  He introduced himself to me as Ranger Argyle and we soon found we had many things in common.  Argyle had been training not much longer than I had and we were both eager to venture forth into more dangerous areas of the world.  We felt we were ready to carry out some of the more rewarding and important missions that our respective guild masters had for us.  After fishing some more we decided to try working together as partners as rangers and druids naturally made a good working team.  Thus the course was set for many future adventures in the world of Norrath.  While there are many great tales I could recount of our exploits I have chosen one that I felt was the most exciting and harrowing to date.
<br><br>
We met up in the Queynos Hills, outside of Surefall Glade.  Near the crossroads to Queynos City and the Western Plains of Karana a couple had set up a small trading business at their cottage.  The cottage was a good meeting place as much of the traffic through the Hills went by it.  It was also a welcome rest stop to chat and meet with other travelers, as well as buy and sell various items as needed.  Also near the cottage were some small hills that some of the Sabertooth Gnolls often sent out scouting parties to and our guilds had made it clear that gnolls were not to be tolerated in our lands.  Argyle and I had been patrolling the hills looking for gnoll scouts and helping to keep the vermin population under control as many of the larger bats and rats had been spreading rabies amongst our bear and wolf brothers.  We had even come across some of the unnatural and unholy undead and I suspected there must be some secret burial ground nearby as powerful skeletons could often been seen wandering the hills late at night.  I will pause to mention here that I had developed a powerful dislike, hatred even, of all skeletons ever since I had been a young druid.  Argyle found it amusing but was willing to allow me my eccentric behavior and would often help me find and destroy any skeletons we could find.  It was shortly after one of these battles that he mentioned that his guild had reported a large increase in the lion population in the Western Plains of  Karana.  We were sitting outside of the cottage having a late dinner and recuperating after destroying a very powerful skeleton that Argyle explained that the lions had been terrorizing local villagers.  While the druids of Surefall were reluctant to harm any animals, I new that the rangers were responsible for the people as well as the animals.  I also had learned to acknowledged that Nature was a balance of forces and sometimes this balance was disrupted.  If the lion population was getting out of control it was part of my duty to bring it back under control.  I had often had to hunt down ill or diseased animals to protect the rest of the population from getting infected so I knew one could not always lead a perfectly peaceful life.  Thus I agreed that I would help him and since I had only visited the plains once before I was eager to see it again, this time with someone I could count on to help me out if I got in over my head (something I often seemed to do).
<br><br>
We set off the following morning arriving at the plains just as the sun was coming up.  What a glorious site to behold and once again I new why I had chosen to become a druid.  Nature was always the cornerstone of my existence and when I saw the beauty and power of the plains I was happy to be in the guild that worshipped the land.  The plains were huge and wild with only a few guards and small villages to mark the otherwise unblemished terrain.  However I also knew that it was not the peaceful place it appeared at first glance.  As Argyle and I began our hike to the first village to talk with some of the locals we saw in the distance some of our more powerful brothers; the mist and shadow wolves along with the more familiar grizzlies and fire beetles.  I could spend days recording some of the site we saw the first few days we spent in the plains but for now I will just say you, the reader, must visit it some day if given the chance.  We saw the mighty Froon, a Cyclops, marching about after a group of unruly adventures foolish enough to disturb his sleep along with his cousins the hill giants.  Luckily we were a safe distance away but these giants of the plains were a site to see even while inside I knew the evil they represented must be put down.  We were also gifted with the blessed event of seeing the noble Treants, beings of great power and revered by druids all over Norrath.  As you can see the plains were not a safe place for the new or uninitiated, however we felt confident in our ability to keep to the roads and our eyes open to any possible danger.  We were here to hunt and track lions and would remember that in our stage of guild training we had to be careful of some of the more powerful residents of the plains.
<br><br>
It was on our second day, and following a tip from a local weaponsmith in a small village, that we found our first lion.  Argyle had been using his remarkable tracking abilities to locate and find lions that were to close to the village.  We had managed to find and scare of, or if needed put down, some of the lions that had set up their community to close to the local inhabitants.  We had just finished resting at a small way station when Argyle noticed a sight I will never forget: A spider of giant proportions.  This monster was horrifying to see, each of its legs larger then Argyle and I put together.  The huge monster was rapidly approaching a small farm outpost and we knew they would be done for if we did nothing to help.  We briefly considered the situation and while we knew it would be risky we decided we had to take the chance and bring the beast down.  
<br><br>
We approached at a run, keeping behind the beast.  I had a pretty good set of spells ready at hand and we had decided that he would taunt the beast to get it to attack him while I would try to blast it with a mixture of lighting and fire spells.  Keeping a few paces behind Argyle I prepared one my most powerful spells, the spell to summon and harness the power of my mighty God, the Rainkeeper, in the form of lighting.  Argyle taunted the creature but slashing its hind legs and yelling his battle cry.  The huge beast paused and turned, enraged.  We wore momentarily frozen in horror as the huge eyes looked down at us, but only for a moment.  As Argyle charged, bringing his sword into play and hoping to dismember some of the spiders legs so that we might have a fighting chance, my lighting spell impacted the monster square on its back.  The beast staggered under the sudden onslaught and we both cheered thinking we had overestimated the beast.  I followed my spell with a slew of rapid fire burst spells that had the creature dazed while Argyle piled blow upon blow of damage with his sword.  I smiled as I saw how we had damaged the creature, but then our luck changed for the worse.  
<br><br>
The spider had poisoned my friend along with a massive blow to his side.  As the huge piercing jaws bit him I saw his body begin to tire and bleed as the blow took effect.  I in turn was almost out of mana but decided I needed to heal my friend of the poison before he was lost.  While I did that the spider recovered, but Argyle seemed better and renewed his attack.  I had a few more spells left and hit the spider with another blast or two.  The misfortune hit again and while my last spell fizzled Argyle was bit and poisoned again and I saw that he was about to drop to the ground unconscious, the poison and wounds eating at his system.  I had no mana left to heal his poison but I knew I could not desert my trusted and loyal companion to this beast nor the poor farmers we were trying to help.  Throwing caution to the wind I spent the last of my mana healing him in a quick burst and then, grabbing my trusty staff, I charged into the attack, trying to distract the spider from Argyle while beating upon its flank with my staff.  I shouted at Argyle to back off, as I was unwounded even if my spells were gone.  However, being the noble ranger he was, he was afraid to leave me.  He knew I was much weaker then he was in close combat so he made a last attack on the beast.  Alas it was to much and he fell unconscious to the ground.  Luckily, at that moment, I managed to get a crucial blow in with my staff and the giant beast finally toppled.  I turned rapidly to my fallen comrade and saw that while unconscious he still lived.  I had managed to regain just enough mana to try one healing spell and was successful as I saw him spring into consciousness, although his health was still dangerously low.   I thought all would be well as soon as we could rest, but Argyle moaned that he was still poisoned.  He sat down to struggle with the vile venom in his blood and I cursed in frustration knowing I could not heal the poison or even heal him.  I sat down next to him praying he might survive.  Regardless of what happened I was determined to stick by his side even as he had risked his life for my own by staying when he could have run to safety.  I groaned in despair as I once again saw him fall into unconsciousness a second time and slowly start to fade.  But then to my joy I saw I had regained just enough mana from the land for another healing attempt.  I was successful and he sprang back into consciousness once again.  This time he told me the poison had finally run its course.  We breathed a collective sigh of relief.  Our hearts pounding, we had won against terrifying odds.
<br><br>
Still it had been close, to close for comfort.  Never had Argyle been so close to death and he had twice thought he was going to die.  This then was what life was all about; being so close to death.  We were exhilarated with excitement as we slowly made our way to the farm to rest.  This then was how we ended our day.  We had conquered a mighty beast, true, but that was not what had made the day so memorable to me.  What made this day stand out was the loyalty of my companion and the knowledge that this was what true adventures were all about.  The heat of battle, the pursuit of what is good, and the loyalty to those who depend on you.  We had both been willing to stand by and defend each other regardless of what we faced and thus knew we could depend and trust one another to do what was needed the next time we adventured together.  Since then we have had more adventures but this one will always stand out in my mind.
<br><br>
Thus ends this tale but I hope to have many more to come in my travels of Norrath,<br>
