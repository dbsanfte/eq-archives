<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;According to http://eq.stratics.com, they say dwarves only have infravision.  My friends in FOH say they have ultravision.  What is the real truth??? 
<br><br>
Fizbar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The real truth is usually beyond me by quite some measure, especially when it has anything to do with dwarves.  Why, I can walk right up to a dwarf and say, "What is the real truth?  Do you have infravision or ultravision?"  He'd stroke his beard, look me up and down a good bit, lick his lips carefully after a swig of dwarven ale, and say, "Why, me lassie, 'tis all in th'brew, all in th'brew."  However, I did ask the Pillars of Wisdom, and two of them (neither of which happens to resemble a dwarf in any way, shape or form), told me that dark elves are the only race with ultravision, and that dwarves, no matter what they may claim after emptying the larder and the beer cellar, have infravision.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I was running around South Karana and I found a head of Shen lying of the ground. I thought it was quite an odd find. I did an /ooc to see if anyone could tell me what I do with it. In a few seconds I hade 4 tells each with a totally different answer. I was told it was for a Monk quest, a Bard quest, a Mage quest and a Wiz quest. This confused the heck out of me. I spent an hour or so searching the internet for any info with no luck. I would like to know what class it is used by, but if you can't tell me that, I'd just like to know if any of the info I was given by those people is correct. Thanks, 
<br><br>
Sabbin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I did do some asking around on this and some searching as well but unfortunately haven't come up with anything definite as to which, if any, of the named classes would benefit from using the Head of Shen.  One Pillar of Wisdom did think that waaaaay back, in the dark ages of his youth in Norrath, he might have heard mention of the item in connection with a monk sash or headband quest, but beyond that, sadly, I have not even a tiny hint to help you figure it out.  Keep asking around and perhaps someone who reads the column and knows what to do with something that sounds like it would be better off buried six feet under, can let us know which classes might benefit from this particular head without a body.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, right now all the languages I know were taught from other players, everything from Barbarian to Elder Dragon.  Okay, I know that Barbarians start out with Barbarian but how does one learn Elder Dragon and such.  No one starts out with it, it has to be learned in the game.  Same with others like Lizard, Combine, Dragon, Elder Erudiin, Elder Elvish, on and on, how does one learn these besides from a player, maybe only certain races can learn a certain language (Only Erudites can learn Elder Erudin).  How do I do it? 
<br><br>
Kilaan
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can tell, and as far as the various  Pillars of Wisdom mentioned while they were all under fire and not wanting to divert their attention to my questions any more than necessary, languages must be learned by listening to someone whose skill in the particular language is higher than your own.  Your skill list will show you all the languages you can learn (by the way, this list is not limited to just the languages you would expect your race and class compatriots to speak) and you may put one practice in any language you want to learn but it isn't necessary.  While some early players must have found a way to solo learning a language, my guess is that it was slow and laborious.  Now, you can watch for language fairs and classes where friendly folk will get you off to a good start in whichever language you are choosing to learn.  Another way to learn a language is to find a friendly expert in the selected language, group with him or her, and while away some friendly hours with some flowing spam.    A pack full of vittles and cold drinks is vital for a venture like this to succeed, or so I'm told.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many different characters can you have on one account? I have 8 characters on a single server, yet there are no problems that I can find with setting up another character on a different server.   Seems like you could have 8 characters on every server out there, but seem to remember reading somewhere that an account was limited to 8. Am worried about just being billed for a second account, or possibly having one of my original characters deleted without notice. Thank you, oh mighty fount of wisdom and beauty. 
<br><br>
Silverwolf
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have up to 8 characters on every single server all on one account with no additional charge.  I don't know of any way you would be billed for a second account and I believe the only way you would see the characters deleted would be by yourself or by Verant six months after you had closed your account.  There have been very rare bugs where characters went missing, but those are usually fixed up pretty fast and have nothing to do with how many characters you have all together.  I'm not exactly a fount of wisdom or beauty, but am definitely one of curiosity.  I'm wondering how many people playing in Norrath have characters on every server or nearly so.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what elves are, what they do, how many races of elves there are,& what those races are.  I am writing a book on elven-vampyres.  Thank you. 
<br><br>
Cwagstaf
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure that a book on elven vampyres would be extremely interesting, although to tell the truth (see above please), I have yet to run into any elves that are long in the tooth in Norrath.  As to what the elves are, I think you might want to go to the official Everquest website and read both the description of the races and the history of the world of Norrath to find explanations of the elven peoples.  There are three races of full elves:  the high elves, the wood elves and the dark elves.  There are, of course, the half-elves, of which I am one, but we'd never consort with fanged fiends, I hope.   Elves do so many different things that I'm sure I could not even come close to describing them in this short column, but you might want to travel to the Faydark and visit their lands and homes (the high elves and wood elves that is) to see for yourself.  As to experiencing Neriak and the hostility of the dark elves, well, I wouldn't suggest it unless your skill in disguise is at mastery.   
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to be having trouble leveling up my mage in the Felwithe area.  The orc camps to strong, the ors pawns are to weak, is there any place on the continent I can go that I won't die or not waste my time?  
<br><br>
Qandiin
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It does sound at least like you have found your way around Greater Faydark which is more than I can say for me.  I can be standing right next to you one moment and turn a half circle and be totally lost the next.  Now, you need to find the path out of Greater Faydark, however, and wander down the road to Steamfont.  You'll find that there will be enough smiting in the vicinity to keep you busy until about level 12 and then you might want to go to the lawns of Unrest for a change of pace and experience.  (It is true that you will want to avoid the hospitality of the house in Unrest for some time to come:  dust bunnies, spider mites, mouldy food, drying blood all over the place.  Yuck!)    Should you decide to venture out to sea and beyond the continent you were born on, you might want to take ship to Freeport and adventure on the fringes of the desert in North Ro.  Hope this gets your little feet itching for exploration and adventure.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago I heard that guilds could purchase a guild house for 10,000 pp.  Was this just a rumor or is it just something else that Verant has yet to implement?  Thanks for your time. 
<br><br>
Zertec
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This rumor does keep going around and around and around.  To the best of my knowledge and that of everyone I have ever asked  (you can see the hordes trying to avoid yet another question by running out of my path as I wander by), there are no plans for guild houses in Norrath.  A wise bard does learn never to say never so I'm not saying never despite the fact that you just read it here three times.  We'll have to see what the future brings.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, this is my first time writing to Q&A. Being a fellow bard, I was hoping that you could possibly be able to answer my query.. I have heard the many praises of something called "Reverse Kiting." Is it something bards are supposed to be very good at once they hit the 26th Octet in their training and they scribe Appalling Screech. I have tried it, Chaining and Screeching, but I am having difficulty twisting the songs well enough to make it effective. Do you, or does someone else know of a good way to use these two songs to my advantage? 
<br><br>
Cygnusia Tempest Tone
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok I had to go to Soliani and the others Pillars of Wisdom in order to even get a clue what "Reverse Kiting" is.  My understanding from them is that if a level 26 or higher bard is in a wide open area with not too many mobs and cares to gamble that this is not an exploit, he or she can use the chaining song to bind a mob in place and then use the screech song to fear it, making it run away.  While it is running, the bard can chase it, whacking away with whatever weapons are at hand, and then repeating the cycle again until the monster is dead.  Soliani has not had any particular benefit from this tactic and doesn't really recommend it.  Since it does involve a tactic where you are basically rendering the monster unable to hit back at you, there is a question in my mind as to whether your local friendly guide or GM might have an issue with this too.   You might want to seek out high level bards on your server and ask them if there are other and better ways to use these songs.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a low level druid.  I was wondering about what level could I start to buy armor and how expensive it is.  Thanks for your time. 
<br><br>
Teawen
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can start to buy armor at any point.  Most players when they begin playing will skip cloth armor, saving their coins for a decent weapon or spells and leather armor.  Another option is to take up the tailoring skill and collect the skins off creatures you kill to make tattered or  patched armor to get you started.  After that, of course, armor gets more and more expensive, but as you gain in levels you will also be fighting monsters that drop armor pieces.  It's also good to seek out the quests for your class and race, as often you will be able to gain better armor and better weapons than by purchasing them.  A cautionary note:  Remember that through level 5 your corpse will poof thirty minutes after you die if you haven't looted it.  If you have equipment you don't want to lose, make sure you are bound near where you are fighting and remember to put all your spare stuff in the bank.  Once you hit level 6, you'll have lots more time to recover your corpse so save that cool piece of equipment your best friend gave you until you hit that level.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, love the site.  Here's my question, and it's probably been answered before, but here goes.  I know when one is early in their career, they get messages for difficulty such as "...upper hand.", "...quite a gamble.", and the ever popular tombstone.  When levels are gained, these messages get more broad in scope.  What are all the messages at these later levels? 
<br><br>
Tyberius
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The /con messages do change somewhere in the mid-level twenties for players.  As, alas, I am only level 25 (although I'm still ahead of the ranger I was racing in levels), I don't have a list for you.  However, my Pillar of Wisdom and good friend Adelrune has provided us with a substitute list until I get to higher levels and can make accurate copies of the messages.  His list is as follows:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green: &nbsp; this creature although below you in level will probably kill you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue:  &nbsp;   this creature will kill you and then some!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White: &nbsp;  ……. forget about it!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yellow: &nbsp; ……. <b>Loading, please wait!</b>

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What combo or race/class is allowed to own pets?  What are their limitations/costs?  How do you go about creating a pet? 
<br><br>
Jestak
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids, shamans, necromancers, magicians and enchanters can all have pets.  The pets are summoned with spells and usually some sort of reagent, i.e., bone chips, tiny daggers, gems, etc., is needed to successfully call one.  Pets are limited by their owner's class, level and skills, and their forms will be class specific.  Pets may be armed but never, ever, ever give one a weapon you cherish as they are notorious for absolutely refusing to return any item you might hand them.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;After recently returning to Qeynos after many months on patrol in the Karanas, I visited the Office of the People. The only vendor behind the counter was selling something called a house key for 1 copper.. intrigued I purchased it and the vendor replied something to the effect here is your key and your rent is 0 (zero) per month... I saw a earlier question about house rentals.. Is this infrastructure to implement this?? 
<br><br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Way back in beta, I listened in on some tavern talk and did hear claims that some day the keys would work and that the rooms upstairs would be a good source of profit for the innkeep provided he could get the maids to keep them clean.  Since that time, however, as far as I have heard, there are no further plans to rent out rooms, the maids have all gone on to open millinery and fashion establishments (although none will make me a dress yet), and the keys are tarnishing away in the drawers.  I have asked reliable city planning officials in Qeynos and Freeport several times if the zoning laws will be amended to allow individual or guild houses, but so far their responses have been an adamant "No!"
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you get married in EQ?  Do you get a GM to officiate?  Thanks. 
<br><br>
Ziyal
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;arried?  Eeeeeeeeeeek!  Shiver!  Ack, not a bard's favorite word by any means!  However, if you must, you must and this is usually how it is done.  When the vic.. err lovers have decided to plight their troth, they select a day and a place for the execu… err ceremony and invite their friends, making sure to plan to have ample food and wine available.  Then, the couple should select the person they choose to marry them and any attendants they wish to have participate in the ceremony.  Please don't allow ogres to be flower girls -- they will eat up every last blossom I promise you.  If the pair chooses to ask a GM to officiate, they should try to give at least a week's notice and should contact either the GM or the guide in charge of weddings on their server.  While GM's are often experienced ceremonialists, the plighted couple may prefer to choose a wise cleric or a good friend to perform the ceremony and this is perfectly acceptable.  Don't expect the half elf bards in your party to be able to wear bridal gowns or even a bridesmaid's dress, sob, as so far, no wedding shoppe in Norrath will be able to accommodate the half-elf limited dress code.  Do feel free to write your own ceremony,  bribe the guards to ignore out-of-favor races, and hire a good bard to commemorate your nuptial day.   Finally, should you decide to share a last name with your bride or your groom, send in a petition for assistance and a GM or Senior Guide will help you with your names.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any sure fired way to make the Mino Hero in Steamfont spawn?  I have been told kill the place holders. I have killed the skeletons ... heck I've killed everything in the valley... HOW do I cause the Mino Hero to spawn? 
<br><br>
Thx Aramathis
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good heavens, I had no idea of the dangerous tactics I would stoop to when I went out to find an answer for you.  Stealth, treachery, sharp daggers, trickery -- none of these could ease the answer to your question out of the Pillars.  The fact of the matter is that  apparently the placeholder (and yes there is one) for the Mino Hero is a closely held secret.  Be reassured, however, from what you said, you are on the right track.   When you have finally encountered the correct placeholder, you will also probably wish to become yet another "Keeper of the Big Secret", resisting the attempts of curious bards to wrest the information from your tightly closed lips.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings, I am Tenalain, 16th level Warrior from the server of Povar. My question is more of a complaint... Recently I lost quite a large amount of my belongings due to a server going down. Although the GM did announce this, I camped only to find upon my return that some of my possessions had gone. I /petitioned 7 times and only ever got 2 answers, one from a guide the other from a GM saying I would get compensation... I waited 2 hours but didn't get anything. Now I hear that just a few nights ago the GM's were taking control of Sand Giants at the Oasis and getting people to levitate them. I pay my fees expecting help, not this kind of attitude.  On another note, don't you think a group should be able to do a /who on anyone in the group and not get an anonymous reply? 
<br><br>
Tenalain
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh dear, it does sound like you didn't get the service promised you and I guess I'd be perturbed too if that happened to me.   Although it may seem slightly rude to the more courteous among us, there is a method to try to get help from very busy and/or often absent guides or gms.  If you should lose your belongings, do as you did and put in a petition immediately saying what happened and what you lost and ask to speak to the GM.  If no GM is on but you do get a response from a guide, ask the guide to tell the GM about your problem, but do not wait for the GM to get back to you.  You may ask for the GM's email address and you should definitely ask when the GM will be on the server (the normal GM shift is 2 pm to 11 pm pacific time, five days a week).   Then come back every day and petition again to talk to the GM.  The keys here are persistence and politeness.  I don't know how long the logs are kept but have heard that it is for a fairly short time, so it is important to very civilly pester the GM until you have a response as to whether he or she will be able to restore your items.  The good thing about this is that when the GM does get to you and has verified the loss of your items, then it doesn't take too long to get things back to rights again.   This might sound like you'll always get your stuff back but in my own experience I know that most times my guildmates and I have lost items in trade window bugs or by accidentally dropping them on the ground and watching them poof, the word has been that those items aren't trackable and thus no replacements.   If you get hit by a bug zoning or camping, however, and items disappear or if they morph into something completely different, the guides and GMs usually will try to figure out what happened and help you if they can.  I do agree with you on the /who issue.  Lots of my guildfellows use the roleplay toggle which makes them anonymous and I don't even know they are on sometimes.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a human shadow knight, but human guards and dark elf guards don't like me.  Factioning with Freeport guards is easy enough, but how do I faction with the Tier'Dal? 
<br><br>
Gonladar
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very very tough faction issue because, as a matter of honest-to-badness fact, the Tier'Dal don't like any other creatures in the world besides themselves and Innoruuk does all he can to keep it that way.  While you might try killing halflings in the forest if you can stand to harm those adorable little creatures, I think it's quite possible that your faction won't improve even then.  The religion of the Tier'Dal may completely control who they like and dislike, so unless you happen to also follow the ways of their deity,  it's  possible that you will never get a Tier'Dal to regard you in a friendly fashion.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I was kinda stupid, and made myself KOS in FP.  I'm wondering, what quest gives the BIGGEST faction boost to Freeport militia? 
<br><br>
Scavenger
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;See a possible solution right below!  *Smiles*
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to raise faction with the militia?  Simple!   Kill Altunic Jartin (or any paladin) then kill EC orcs to raise faction with the paladins.  
<br><br>
Iniigo
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing.  I hope it helps Scavenger.

<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all as I was reading your issue 109 Q&A the Ctrl-selects-one-item thing was posted by Verant a while back.  :)   It was first submitted by players and was put in with a new patch.  Just to help ya out there. And the second question. Is there some way to get to the docks in Freeport without running into any of the evil guards?   *I'm KOS and a ranger arggh* 
<br><br>
JasTiger
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the background on the crtl-select option.  I've been playing and singing in Norrath now for going-on two years (this coming June or July, can't quite remember which), and one thing I do know is that the players in our world have been responsible for imagining and requesting many of the improvements to play that Verant has made.  Verant, in its turn, continues to ask questions and listen to all of us as it keeps looking for ways to make play easier and more fun.  That said, may I PLEASE have a dress?  (Grin.)  As to your question on getting to the docks, I believe that the answer is yes -- if you are very careful.  You will need to find the secret entrance to the city (well there is at least one) from outside the walls and then, very carefully, listen for the sound of the sea and follow your ears to the open passage to the water.  You may need a little trickery or invis to actually get on the boat, but you should be able to get to the docks just fine.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In your last issue, you stated that there are no quests to raise faction with Freeport merchants. I'm happy to say you are mistaken. Well, not happy that you *were* mistaken, happy that there is a quest that raises faction with them. I don't like giving away spoilers, but it starts at the rogue guild. It's a bit tedious, but it's a good way to raise faction. Thank ye for your time. 
<br><br>
Faeldar Loupgarou, Druid of the 34th leaf,  Xegony
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for writing and I hope this gives a helpful hint to those seeking to make such faction adjustments.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way to raise your faction with the Freeport tradesfolk. There is a dwarf, and a dark elven woman in the tunnels under East Freeport.  They will give you a quest to do, and upon completion of these quests you get a boost in the Freeport merchants' faction.   
<br><br>

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, too, for writing in to help the faction-challenged among us.  I appreciate you taking the time to do so.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a question, but more of an answer about raising your faction within Freeport.  Due to the many long, arduous hours I spent within Highhold Keep, let it be known that you may be able to turn in goblin ears to Captain Bosec within these hollowed halls to raise your Freeport faction.  I am 99% sure of this fact, as I see many high levels and dark guildies come in and trade the ears.  The ears are obtainable through killing the goblins (or orcs) in the basement of HH Keep, and can also be bought from the various other players who have valiantly fought there.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Just wanted to say that recently I saw the best two dueling names ever... it said... Overcrowding beats Playablezones in a duel to the death!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile, I really need to start keeping track of these.  This  pair is hilarious!
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside to the Social Hot Key bindings:  It's true you can't use two say statements in one bind.  But you CAN use one say with various commands.  For example, I have my elemental attack bound to a key with the following commands:  /pet attack /em points towards his target! /s Remove this blight Lucky!  In this way, the pet will respond as the say is reported.  I've also noticed that if the actual command does not go first, the key won't work.   Keep up the good work! 
<br><br>

</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for adding to the information on socials and hot keys.  I appreciate  your help.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding multiple lines of text...It is possible. In my mage character I have some witty sayings &lt;g&gt; to use with my pet. One of them used 2 lines of say, and if I recall, this was it (it got wiped out in the tribunal crash):  /pet guard me,  /say Here, boy!, :whistles,  /say C'mon!

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, yet another set of possibilities.  Thanks for writing!

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Re the term Mob:  In Australia we call a herd of sheep or cattle a 'Mob', could be a
cultural thing but it is a very old term used very often in the Bush.  Keep up the great work
<br><br>
Peku from Tribunal
<br>
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that's very cool.  I wonder how the word Mob ever got applied to a herd of sheep and then became part of the lingo?  Thanks for writing in.
<br><br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you can shed some light on the issues of how players/guilds handle access and play on the planes on different servers.  On several servers I have heard that guilds are very protective about plane access once they have broken them.  Just because the planes have very interesting loot and are difficult to play, why are they somehow played or treated differently then other tough zones ?  These policies on some servers seem to be causing more troubles as greater number of players are high enough to want to venture forth into these new an exciting planes.  Any thoughts oh -great bard ?

<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know about the great bard part, but heck I always have thoughts about stuff.  (See reference to "the real truth" at the beginning of this column.)  Mainly, I think you have written in about one of the most difficult tensions that players face as they rise in level and want to venture into the lairs of the dragons and onto the planes.  I've heard that on some servers, a group or a guild will lay claim to an entire zone and threaten anyone who comes there without their permission with blackballing from future trips, refusal to help on corpse retrievals, etc.  Other groups don't seem to mind company as much and generally will decide ahead of time how much they will help each other, who gets to loot, etc.  Some servers have experienced nasty thievery when a group finally kills a dragon only to lose the loot to someone who snuck in and grabbed it while the group was deciding how it should be split.  There have also been issues with a group taking on a dragon or breaking a zone only to die en masse and then a group or guild waiting in the wings comes in and tries to complete the foray gaining the benefits from those who died without giving anything back to them.  As far as anyone has ever told me, however, no group owns a zone or an npc and that very general policy creates a major dilemma for anyone called in to mediate the disputes that inevitably arise in the high level zones.   Let's say that a guild had been attempting a plane for a long period of time, hours and hours, with many deaths.  Another group from half way around the world comes on, fresh and with full inventories of equipment and rushes into the plane, now more than half empty with just a few juicy mobs left to do, and proceeds to kill the highest monsters and take the loot the first group had been working toward for hours.  Is this fair?  Should there be some sort of intervention?  Is this just competition or is it really one group exploiting the work of another?  I don't have any answer for you and quite honestly, I haven't seen an official response to this Ghordian knot of issues either.  My own feeling is that if a zone takes a major effort to "break" it, there should be some basic protection in place for the group which has done so.  Even if they are all dying off, over and over again, I feel that the group should have the right to invite others to help or to keep working away at it on their own.  That kind of effort is the stuff of sagas for future generations and it seems to me that it would be fair to find a way to protect it.  Does this mean I think the same rules should be applied to the non-plane or non-dragon zones?  Nope, because those zones, as difficult as they may prove depending on what a group is trying to accomplish, don't take that initial special effort to get started.  I sure would love to see the players and Verant work to clarify this problem before every high level player is furious with every other high level player over an experience in the planes.  It seems like developing a policy on high level areas that we can all understand would really help.

Thanks all for writing in.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.
