And so it begins anew.
<br><br>
Chat boards are flooded.  Newsgroups overflow.  The torrent of questions just keeps coming, and there is no damn large enough or sturdy enough to withstand the pressure.  All across our community our thoughts and comments, our hopes and dreams, are being drown.  Several net citizens have gone missing.  Though hopes are high for their recovery, no search for them can be made until after the flood recedes and the skies clear.  And until then most of us are heading for higher ground, though even those places are starting to leak.
<br><br>
I don't need to say this, but I like saying it.  RELAX!  Let's tell Verant where we see problems, but howsabout giving them a chance to fix it before attacking the rest of us with your anger.  Yes, they know there is a problem with the chat server.  And so do the rest of us.  The team at Verant will get it working, they've done it before, they'll do it again.  All of the complaining and repeated postings asking if the servers are up are only serving to make it so that the real bugs, the real problems, are being obscured.  But I could rant all day, and those that are out there nodding in agreement are already aware of this, and those that are telling me to shut up aren't gonna listen anyhow...
<br><br>
So maybe I should talk about something more interesting.  I hope you can hear me over the sound of the rushing deluge.
<br><br>
How about a few tips and suggestions for those new to EverQuest.  Mostly simple things that most of you have already figured out.
<br><br>
First and foremost, bugs.  Please report all bugs.  But make sure it is a bug first.  Is it something you're doing wrong, or something with your system and not the game client?  For example, I have seen several people post about their corpse disappearing before they could find it.  Well, there is a time limit on the decay of corpses.  Those of low level will disappear in 30 minutes.  This is not a bug.  I've lost a corpse already because I locked up just after death and couldn't get back in fast enough.  The best thing to do is to talk to others in your area and see if they've got an answer for you.  Oh, and if someone asks you about a bug, help them to discern the truth, don't just run off looking for your next kill.  And if you think it might be a bug, try to recreate it.  If that means you have to get killed again, do it.  Once you've verified that it is a bug, then use the /b function.  Please include the /loc of your character and the zone you are in.
<br><br>
We are our own best resource.  Right now I suspect that the guides are overwhelmed, and I also think they are having as much trouble logging in as we are right now.  So we have to rely on each other.
<br><br>
Let's not forget etiquette.  Having been in the beta a while, I've had the chance to watch the etiquette of the game evolve.  I like what I've seen, and I would encourage all of you to help us keep it pleasant.  In the early stages of the game there just were not enough of us to be a problem for each other.  But as our numbers grew, we came to realize that there will be times when two groups or individuals will want to hunt the same beast.  It is polite to let the one that got there first have the kill.  I suppose that's obvious.  But it is also important not to spend all your energy trying to kill everything in site.  Pace yourself and let the ecology recover while you rest.
<br><br>
It is also polite to help out someone if they are in trouble (assuming you're not a Teir'dal :P ).  There is a fine line between helping and butting in.  It's pretty easy to ask someone if they need help.  Ask before you intervene.  If someone is running, it might not be a good idea to wait, so if you are inclined to help, just do so.  And if someone jumps in and saves your bacon, don't yell at them for helping, even if you didn't need it.  Do that a few times, and you won't get any help when you need it the most.  You now live in a relatively small community, and people will remember your deeds, both good and bad.
<br><br>
Oh, and for some reason all chat filters are off by default.  I spent a good twenty minutes wondering why the heck Archanalia was refusing to respond to my comments over group chat.  And I also wondered why my ooc offer to help anyone in the zone that had questions went unanswered.  So check yer filters.  It's gonna be hard enough getting to know Norrath if you can't hear anything that's going on around you.
<br><br>
And please, oh please, take the time to learn of your world.  You will find interesting plot lines, fascinating characters, and a fair amount of entertainment if you talk to the NPCs.  Learn who like who in your home town.  And learn who hates who.  Did you just kill an Orc?  That should make your fellow citizens happy.  Did you kill an aviak?  Hmm...   perhaps that bird-man was an ally to your city?
<br><br>
Let's see, what else.  Oh, check all of your options.  Make sure that you know how your keys are mapped, and change them as you see fit.  Some folks have had a bit of trouble when they attacked a merchant because they hit the 'a' key when trying to talk to them without opening the chat box first.  Well, we've all done that once or twice...
<br><br>
And my last comment: read the manual, folks.  It's in your EverQuest directory.
<br><br>
There's probably tons more, but that's all I can think of now.
