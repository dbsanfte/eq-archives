The seventeen strong party of men stomped across the East Plains to the
continental divide led by Porthios. Even in the seasonal downpour Bastion's
eyes never dimmed, knowing that the hands of the Faceless One had guided him
this far with a corrupt priestess feeding him numbing leaves between lashings
from the flagellants. He thought it comical that the followers of the god of
light were so brutal, just as brutal as any Lord of Terror, with less mercy
upon the enemy. The words of the Light Bearer burnt into his skull like hot
knives and the lashings broke away at his resolve but he would never tell
Porthios what lay ahead.

Occasionally Bastion would consider if the Cardinal had seen the future and
knowingly condemned him to this fate, knowing that the Wood Elves would never
see the treasure the scroll was sent for; knowing that Bastion would take it
and run. He wondered how far behind Yvette and the mercenaries were, and if
they would catch up before it was too late. Just as he was cursing the gnome
for a fool for sending him, his prayers were answered.

In the late evening mists large figures could be seen moving in on the war
party. The group spread into a tight formation as the shouts of the Ogres
could be heard. "The Scourge Gromlyko, Sir," the head Ranger told the
Paladin. "He has burnt many of the farms here. Be ready for Pagan Shaman
Magic."
<br><br>
The paladin nodded. "I am always ready for anything, that is why I am still
alive."
