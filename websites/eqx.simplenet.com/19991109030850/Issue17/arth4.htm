Slsslythk came to the corridor which contained the underground river.  If he entered
this water, it would lead down to the level where all the noise was coming from.
With a shiver, Slsslythk entered the water, and the swift current took him down.
Eyes closed and breath held, he banged against a few walls as the water swirled
around him.  In a couple of seconds… There!  He quickly gulped a breath as the stream
entered a small room, then was swept back into darkness.

Whirling and tumbling, he
at last came out into the large cavern.  As he approached the center of the cavern,
he spied a ledge under a bridge which spanned the stream and slid onto it to catch
his breath. Here was the room from which all the activity could be safely monitored.
No one would think to look for him here, and the smell of the water in the cavern
would befuddle the sensitive noses of the Hairy Ones.

Thumping footsteps above his head caused Slsslythk to raise up in alarm.  A human?
Here in the Hairy Ones home?  No wonder the Hairy Ones were in an uproar. Slsslythk
carefully peeked up to look and see what was going on.  Waiting until the footsteps
had gone over, Slsslythk slipped up to edge of the bridge.
