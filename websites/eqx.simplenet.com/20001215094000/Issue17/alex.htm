The musty smell of oil lamps filled the dark wood room, and smoke hung in the
rafters. The assembled Consulate of High Priests stood in silence as the Master of
Ceremonies prepared to read the criminal his final judgment. Here stood a man without
friend or ally and in question of his faith. His faith in the God of the church would
be on trial today, a trial by death. With finality the MC spoke.

"You accused the Cardinal of a very serious crime, that of treason and murder. By law
a common man must be put to trial when he speaks such an atrocity. You are but a
vagabond, a rogue knight of a dead family with no honor. Today you have the chance
to regain your title, by swearing fealty to the Cardinal and to God. This is your
only chance Alexander. Kneel down and confess your sins and be forgiven!"

Alexander spoke with the honor and nobility of his family, being the sole surviving
son of his father the Noble Lord Gustav, who was slain with the rest of the family
by an unknown assassin. "You commit the greater sin by speaking of God and the
Cardinal in the same breath, Master of Ceremonies. He killed my father!" With that
he was ushered to the podium for his sentence.
<br><br>
The MC spoke with anger, "For that you will be thrown into the pit where your soul
shall be cleansed in the trial by death. May God have mercy on your soul!"
