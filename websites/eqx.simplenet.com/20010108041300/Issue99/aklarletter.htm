Dear Faithful Reader (and all you others who have at one time or another read some of my ramblings and found them mildly entertaining),
<br><br>
It is with a heavy heart that I bring this news.  I am leaving EQX.
<br><br>
This is not a step I take willingly, but I find that of late, my time has become increasing short.  Now, with a new and exciting adventure looming on the horizon, I have a hard and painful decision to make.
<br><br>
I have been mentored with a published author through a local Writer's Association, and will be dedicating my time to developing an actual novel.  With that, school, and sundry other obligations in the (shudder) real world, I have to be realistic in how much I can handle.  I cannot give EQX the time and effort that they deserve, and so I am leaving.
<br><br>
To all of you who wait breathless on the cusp of the Rogue tale, I cannot tell you how much it pains me to leave you hanging.  However, the novel that I am writing now is based on the bare bones of Rogue (minus all references to Norrath, Freeport, or anything at all remotely Everquestian), so I can promise that Kinory shall not die.
<br><br>
Alas, so that I do not die of loneliness, I must also take from you Auntie Moog, who has been a bosom friend of mine for a long time.  This issue will be her last column, as well.  She hands the reins of romantic and practical advice over to Mundas.  Good taste dictates that I remain silent on her opinion of this transfer.
<br><br>
I shall miss the staff here at EQX dreadfully.  I shall always be thankful to them for their support, enthusiasm, and help in getting me started.  I shall also forever be thankful to all those who wrote and gave me encouragement, advice, and told me that they liked my little yarns.  Watch ye the shelves at thine local bookshop.  Perhaps one day my name will be there, and then you'll know that it was, in part, thanks to you.

<em>[Just a note from yer editor.  We'll miss this dear lady much, and we are all sorry to see her go, for entirely selfish reasons.  We all know that she's to very well as an author.  And we will let you know when her books hit the shelves.  Oh, and Mundas... well, that lil' fella isn't really what we're looking for in an advice columnist...]</em>
