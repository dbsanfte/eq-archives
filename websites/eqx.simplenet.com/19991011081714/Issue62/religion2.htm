"<em>As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, created the Barbarians, a hardy race who settled the cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally unwashed and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while they too had a warlike culture, there were those amongst them who began to believe in something more. By this time the other civilizations of Norrath had either long since declined, or were well on their way, and this small minority of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others had failed. Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or perhaps it was only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out across the lands, warring with both each other and any other race encountered, this tiny movement continued to grow. And so even amidst desolation and war, there was hope. Thus began the Age of Blood.</em>"

As the creation of Valor and Love, Barbarians are the youngest, and last race created by the Gods of Norrath. As stated in their creation myth, they are also the only races gifted with something "else". I'm reminded a bit of the Greek myth of Pandora. Inside a world which has had plagues, war, and disaster let loose upon it, little Pandora receives "hope". Perhaps the Barbarians are the race to actually have a sense of something outside themselves, something worth dying for that is not a selfish response for glory, or riches, or power, but a sort of higher cause.
<br><br>
The Barbarians are a good example of how Mythic language can affect a religion. What is a myth, and what is mythic language? Ancient Greeks used the term "mythos" to mean anything delivered by word of mouth, such as a statement, an order, or a story. As time went on, <em>mythos</em> became contrasted from other types of speech, and came to mean the original, most ancient account of the origin of the world, the stories of the divine, and sacred tradition. It was different than <em>epos</em>, or human narrative, and <em>logos</em> - rational discourse. In other words, <em>mythos</em> was fanciful, made up - not something rational.
<br><br>
We now often see the word myth used in a negative sense. We see myths as wild tales from other cultures, showing how their gods interact and how they were created. We speak of "Ten Myths about Cancer", or the "Myth of Gender Equality in the Workplace." The study of religion, however, requires a slightly different meaning. Myth is the word of truth, not necessarily in a "real" sense, as if all myths are historical fact. But myths are a speaking of Truth in the higher sense of the underlying, more spiritual reality
<br><br>
Religions are based in myth. It is mythic language which gives a religion it's origin, tales of beings, and teachings that create the basis for the rest of religious endeavor. Myth is, in many ways, another word for belief. Genesis, the Resurrection, the Enlightenment of Buddha - all these myths tell the reasons why the religion exist and give an example of how followers should behave.
<br><br>
Myth has both a symbolic and applied function. Myth organizes the calendar (our current, real life calendar is based on the Roman gods). Myth creates sites of holiness - such as the Wailing Wall, the city of Jerusalem, or even a Zen sitting room. Shrines and churches are constructed in places of holy significance. Ritual is often a direct re-enactment of myth - the Mass, where wine and bread become into the blood and flesh of Christ. Myths are use to give added dignity to cultural transitions or passages. Ritual, in turn, allows us to participate in the holy through a closeness obtained from mythic reality.

In the EverQuest creation myth, we get a retelling of the Ages of Norrath, and also how each race came to be. The barbarians, seeing this myth as the true origin of their race, have become estranged from their creators, as they no longer worship them. Perhaps it is because the "gift" given Mithaniel Marr and Erollisi Marr may have been the power to change:
<br><br>
<em>It is surmised by the more knowledgeable historians that while the elder races regrouped and reestablished themselves, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed both physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the last major and direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the reason so little is known about this period is that the gods wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to do with their creations. In any case, this small and enlightened group were the fathers of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy.</em>

<br><br>
The barbarians' most worshipped god, and indeed, the only god the barbarian clergy can worship, is the Tribunal. The "Six Hammers of Justice" seek to ensure that those who commit misdeeds are punished. Retribution, vengeance and the punishment of miscreants are the holy tasks of the worshippers of this stern group. Those followers are not mindless revenge freaks, however. They are the stern administrators of true justice, beyond all laws, yet seeking out the truest sense of retribution. Punishing an innocent is a high crime in the minds of a follower of the Tribunal.
<br><br>
The worship of the Tribunal, in a way, is a twisted representation of Valor and Love. Barbarians were created by the newest gods on the block, and while they added a special something, all the gods were quick to abandon their creations in the Lost Age, which is when barbarians became humans. The Tribunal is not mentioned in the creation story, and this omission may indicate that barbarians have created their own gods to worship.
<br><br>
Passing through the obvious gods of profession, the rogues and warriors can also be agnostic. Could it be that the barbarians perhaps feel that the gods have abandoned them, giving more power to the humans, and on to the erudites? The choice of agnosticism gives credence to a sense of loss from their creative force. Also, having seen a race <em>created from them</em>, barbarians perhaps believe that gods are perhaps fictions, self-justifying tales of other races. It is entirely possible that humans were the first agnostics, since no god created them.
<br><br>
Barbarians are the first race to see forces beyond those of the gods acted upon a race, and they choose a god who was not a creative force as their main deity. Law, structure, and the meting out of strict retribution are the most important things to this stern culture. A barbarian is likely to be true to his/her word, and treaties for action, whether war or trade, are likely to be strictly upheld. This rough form of honor is perhaps the only remaining link the barbarians exercise to their co-creator, Mithaniel Marr.

Next we look at the Dwarves, and I will expound further on ritual, time, and myth.
