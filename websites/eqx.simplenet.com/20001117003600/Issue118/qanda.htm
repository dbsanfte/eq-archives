  <i><b>Q:</b> 'Ullo, I am a gnomish wizard, and I 'ave a few questions. I heard 
  about all these normal gods, Bertoxx, Solsusek Ro, and them, but who is Xegony 
  and Druzzil Ro and them?</i></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Now there is a typically gnomish question arising out of insatiable 
  curiosity and sigh, this half elf bard is not going to be able to help all that 
  much. A good friend of mine, when I asked about Xegony, described him most succinctly 
  as “a weirdo”! Beyond that, I don’t have any information on him. Sadly, I don’t 
  have a lot more information on Druzzil Ro except that it sounds like he might 
  be related to Solusek Ro and thus might have some connection to elemental characteristics. 
  I would love it if anyone reading the column would help fill in the blanks on 
  these members of the Norrathian Pantheon.</font></p>

  <i><b>Q:</b> I use 2 different types of wrist armor (leather and black iron), 
  and I notice that the actual wristband displayed tends to switch quite often 
  (by zoning, logging on, etc) from wrist slot 1 and 2 (and vice versa). Which 
  wrist graphic is 'typically' the one displayed? Slot 1 or 2?</i></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Tagad, the Pillar of Wisdom, back from a week’s breather from my constant 
  questions, says that the wrist graphic that is displayed is the one on the right, 
  which is slot 2. If the wrist item you want showing is in slot 2, you shouldn’t 
  have a problem. However, a word of warning -- if you loot your corpse it is 
  possible that the order of looting will place the item you had in slot 2 in 
  slot 1 and the item that was in slot 1 will end up in slot 2, thus changing 
  the graphics.</font></p>

  <i><b>Q:</b> Why have Karana if nature is run by Tunare? There's no need for 
  Veeshan either, cuz birds (which are animals) hang out in the sky. And the Tribunal? 
  Isn't that one of the Marr's subordinates? Oh, and what is Druzzil the god of? 
  And Tallon or Luclin for that matter?</i></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Karana, the god of weather and rain, governs an entirely different 
  sphere of Norrath than does Tunare. If Karana did not exercise his will over 
  the weather, the world would be sucked into a massive tempest, and quite frankly, 
  there’s plenty of rain as it is without going to such extremes. Tunare, while 
  of course concerned with watching over nature, is the Mother of All and thus 
  limiting her influence to just the animals takes away from her power of generativity 
  for all living beings. I think Veeshan might dispute your assertion that there 
  is no need for her, as she is the Goddess of the DRAGONS for heaven’s sake, 
  not the birds, and although she lives in the Plane of Sky, her concern is for 
  the superiority of everything draconic. Now, the Tribunal, I’m a bit hazy on 
  but Tagad, aka a Pillar of Wisdom, tells me that the Tribunal is made up of 
  masked beings, who focus on retribution, vengeance and punishment. They are 
  also known as the Six Hammers and I think the Marrs wouldn’t really like to 
  share tea with them very often. Ok, moving on to Druzzil Ro -- that one, as 
  mentioned above, I’m not sure about although with the last name Ro, my guess 
  is there is a connection to Solusek. Tallon Zek, however, is definitely one 
  of the twin sons of Rallos Zek and is in charge of either strategy or tactics, 
  but I’m not sure which and so far, I haven’t wanted to risk my pretty neck to 
  try to find out. Finally, another Pillar of Wisdom, tells me that Luclin is 
  not a “who “ at all, nor a god, but is one of the discovered moons of Norrath. 
  I wonder if there are other moons?</font></p>

  <i><b>Q:</b> Hello! Biffin hears that you are a wise bard from Deputy Tagil 
  in Rivervale and you might be able to help the Biffin with his problem! Biffin's 
  sister Kizzie Mintopp in Rivervale makes Honeyjum. One day Biffin was stealing 
  the Honeyjum but he was caught by Kizzie! She then took his footcomb! Without 
  his footcomb, Biffin has itchy feet forever! Biffin wonders what you do about 
  itchy feetsies? Biffin's fleas are getting mad at him because he does not have 
  his footcomb. What do you do when your fleas are mad? Biffin does not want them 
  to leave him, they are his friends! Also Biffin wonders if you will grow a beard? 
  No female Elves Biffin has run into will grow a beard for him :( Biffin finds 
  that meanie weenie!</i></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Oh my dear, now see what happens from a little innocent thievery of 
  Honeyjum? I hope you have decided that when you figure a way out of this dilemma 
  with Kixxie that next time you will ask for the Honeyjum politely? However, 
  it wasn’t very nice of Kixxie to steal your footcomb and I think she owes you 
  an apology, a large backpack full of Honeyjum and a pleasant little footcombing 
  session to make up for the inconvenience to you and your fleas. If she adamantly 
  refuses, then in order to keep your fleas, you should be sure not to bathe your 
  feet at all and perhaps you might check Runnyeye for a sharp flat rock that 
  could serve as a substitute comb. Fleas usually don’t last long as potential 
  friends in my vicinity for some odd reason, so I think I’m not the best person 
  to give advice on what to do when they’re mad. ( I think my response might be 
  too violent for a sweet halfling such as you!) So perhaps you might want to 
  sit in a quiet sunny spot and chat with your fleas to calm them down and build 
  their trust again. They would probably enjoy a long story in just the same way 
  I enjoyed your letter. Immensely! Sadly, however, despite the fact I am totally 
  charmed by your name and your demeanor and would love to hear more about your 
  fleas, I cannot grow a beard to persuade you I am not a meanie-weenie. My explanation 
  may seem a bit indelicate, but, simply put, bards with beards end with up with 
  spittle in the little chin hairs after blowing a horn or tooting a flute. Can 
  you imagine anyone who would want to get within 6 feet of me if I had a beard 
  in such condition? *Shudders at the thought!* So you see, I’m not being a meanie 
  to refuse to grow a beard, but rather I’m being a very considerate bard who 
  would simply prefer to avoid grossing you out. Thank you for writing and I hope 
  you can find a comb your fleas will enjoy. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Q:</b> 
  Hmm. This may violate your bias toward mystery, but I am an SK who has been 
  playing for several weeks. I am constantly surfacing random loot items that 
  I have no idea what they are for, and usually, actually, have no use for. I 
  end up auctioning them, but my most frequent auction response is: "I want it, 
  but tell me how much you want to charge...I don't know." I, of course, don't 
  have a clue, and don't want to cheat or be cheated. Is there a good source out 
  there for uses and approximate auction value of non-weapon, non-armor items? 
  (Examples include: Embalming Dust, Utricating Hairs from Spiders, Bloodstones, 
  etc. -- some are worthless, and some, like bloodstones, I can find a use for 
  but no price even after lots of web surfing.</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  Beraan</font></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> There are of course, many spoiler sites available for EQ as far as 
  information on various non-weapon, non-armor items goes and you might want to 
  follow the links from EQ Vault or the main EQ website to find some of the sites. 
  However, as far as I know, there is no good source for item prices as the economy 
  varies from server to server and even varies from day to day on a given server. 
  You can, of course, decide to try to sell high and then lower your price if 
  you find no takers, but if you are concerned about a fair asking value, you 
  can wander among the hangers-on in Freeport and get a variety of opinions before 
  trying to sell the item or you can check the various public message boards and 
  ask for opinions on the current sales price of the item you want to be rid of. 
  </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Q:</b> 
  I know that a player can have 8 different characters on each server. That tells 
  me that the information for each character is kept on that server. My question 
  is, if I go on vacation and take EQ with me and load it on my brother's computer 
  (not copy the game, just load and play while I'm there). Can I access and play 
  my characters as normal?</i></font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Yes, indeed, you can feed your EverQuest addiction even on vacation! 
  Smiles. All of your character information is held on the Verant servers, not 
  your home computer. If you do want to play while on vacation, simply take your 
  EQ disc with you, install it on your brother’s computer (assuming he has the 
  system specifications the game needs) and patch the files for the updates. At 
  56K the patch might take around an hour, so do allow the time for that. Once 
  you are patched, you’re ready to give your password and log on. A cautionary 
  word here -- it is best to not share your password with anyone and to make sure 
  your brother’s computer is free from hacking viruses that might give away your 
  password to someone looking for it. Once you are on, then have a great vacation 
  playing EQ ! :)</font></p>

  <i><b>Q:</b> Well, seeing the discussion on the -gry puzzle, I thought I would 
  do a bit of research, and see what I could turn up. Well first of all, there 
  are about 40 obscure words in the English language that end in -gry (source:http://www.scoopy.com/gry.htm), 
  and second, the riddle is often told wrongly, it should read: "Think of words 
  ending in -GRY. Angry and hungry are two of them. There are only three words 
  in the English language. What is the third word? The word is something that 
  everyone uses every day. If you have listened carefully, I have already told 
  you what it is." To which, if you examine closely, you will see the answer is 
  "language"</i></font></p>

  <i><b>Q:</b> As to the age old riddle of the 3 -gry's, the 3rd word is GRY. 
  It is an old English word and found only in older reference materials. I think 
  if I remember right I found it first in an older Cambridge. Takes a smart darkelf
