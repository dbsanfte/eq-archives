To the Staff at EQExpress:
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and devotion to this wonderful site. Although and
avid paper and pen role-player in my younger days, the time and connections
to continue playing fell by the wayside.  Imagine how excited I was to hear
of a game that combined the setting and opportunity to re-experience  those
games on my own. I bought a copy of UO a little over a year ago, having
never played an online game before, I was lost. I love video games so
believing I could survive in this world I set off to enjoy my new found
freedom. Little did I know.....
<br><br>
I learned about Everquest a long time ago, while still playing UO. I would
look at the site and long expectantly. I applied for beta testing.
(Although I was accepted for phase 4 I was not able to get my response back
in time) So I must wait.
<br><br>
Being also a new comer to the net ment I was surprised to see a site like
yours. I had become cynical about the web, due to my lack of knowledge and
lack of  apparent substance of the web.
<br><br>
Upon discovering your site one night I was amazed.  I then proceeded to
devour everything. The stories are incredible, I personally think they
should be compiled and published. I would encourage you to motivate those
that have not finished there's to do so.  I have learned so much from
reading this site, NOT just about everquest but role-playing in general. You
have also made me more aware of the  issues surrounding online gaming.
<br><br>
Now for my question. I have read on the official Everquest site about planes
of existence. Other than the material plane of Norrath, I have never heard
one word about these planes on this site. Maybe you could shed some light on
the subject for us.  I am mearly curious about the subject and would like to
know more about it. Since it seems like it could be a large portion of the
game a few comments on this subject are more than justified.
<br><br>
Well I know you are all busy and I do not want to keep you from your
excellent writing I will close for now. Once again thank you for your time a
nd please keep it up. There are still those out there that are not playing
YET.
<br><br>
Sincerely David L Dobbs
 <br><br>
 <em>[Ed. - Well, I posed your question to Brad on the TalkSpot chat.  Read through 
 my <a href="edita.htm">editorial</a>, I included his answer there.]</em>
