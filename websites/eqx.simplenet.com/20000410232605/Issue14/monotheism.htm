What would you do if you wished to worship Rallos Zek?&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you approach his sphere of influence as a character?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a deity you wish to worship whole-heartedly, as a cleric, or as a lay person?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a deity you want to try to influence in your favor?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a deity you wish to placate, and ignore you?&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you figure this out?
<br><br>
Any description of a deity give you clues to temperament, interests, "alignment", and areas of control.&nbsp;&nbsp;From these indicators you could develop an ethos and style of worship for your character.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few more deities at <a href="http:\\www.everquest.com">Everquest</a> to look at, but I chose Rallos Zek to start with.

Let’s start with "alignment".  For lack of a better term, alignment refers to a general world view which guides action and temperament.  In most rpgs, alignment has three categories along two axis.  One is the order/chaos axis, usually ranging from Lawful through Neutral to Chaotic.  The order/chaos axis shows whether you are aligned toward individual over society (chaos) or society over the individual (order).  Thus Spock’s quote: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few".  The other axis is the good/evil axis, which determines the means you use to meet the ends of the order/chaos axis.  It runs from good through neutral to evil.  Determining a gods alignment, then determines for a good part their worshippers world view.
