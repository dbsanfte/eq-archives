  </i>Ho and hiya, Neppy here! And I had the name first! A perfectly good name 
  for a halfling rogue who manages to weasel her way into all kinds of interesting 
  situations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, Nepenthia-of-the-nearly-copycat-name 
  is off to Lake Rathe to sulk and drown her sorrows over having no questions 
  to answer although I s&#146;pect she is prolly getting some rays and practicing 
  her swan dive off the aviak boards when the birds are busy elsewhere. So anyway, 
  there wasn&#146;t any Question and Answer column last week and I got to thinking, 
  hmmmm, how come she never answers the important questions, the ones I hear popping 
  around Norrath? For instance, has anyone ever asked her if Fippy the Gnoll&#146;s 
  blue fur grows naturally that way or whether they have a dye shop in Blackburrow? 
  And then I wonder if that ogre lady loose in Freeport ever got her &#147;love&#148; 
  questions answered? (Who could possibly put answers to love questions into ogre-speak?) 
  Nooooo, Nepenthia&#146;s always just doing those high and mighty issues, like 
  ummm how to learn languages or what to do with the long pointy end of a spectre&#146;s 
  tail. Sooooo, here&#146;s the questions you always wanted to have answers too. 
  And if you want Nepenthia&#146;s fancy-falutin&#146; verbosity and continuous 
  requests for a dress, then you&#146;d better write to her so she has a reason 
  to head back to town.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  Is it true the gnolls of Blackburrow dye their fur blue and have to have a touchup 
  job every other week?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> Yes, 
  haven&#146;t you ever noticed the peculiar blue of the water when you fall off 
  the cliff and land right smack in the middle of some pissed off gnolls? Well, 
  the deal is, the gnolls aren&#146;t mad at you because you fell in. What they 
  are really angry about is that you might notice the water is tinted by runoff 
  from the furdresser&#146;s shop hidden away in the cliffs there. Now, you might 
  ask, why would the gnolls want blue fur? I mean, it doesn&#146;t exactly set 
  off those fangs does it? Well the answer is actually found in their music. If 
  you listen carefully sometime (better hide to stay alive, of course), you will 
  find the gnolls favor gothgnollpunkrock music and decided that dyeing their 
  fur blue would set them aside from the Abergnolly and Fitch clans over in the 
  Karanas. Leave it to the gnolls to be slightly out of date. My guess is that 
  it won&#146;t be too long until they all have long blonde fur to go with their 
  toothy grins and go around barking Hanson songs. As for the touchup job? Well 
  of course -- just check out Fippy&#146;s belly sometimes. One day it&#146;ll 
  have all these little black roots and the next pure blue. I&#146;ve seen it 
  myself!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  I heard there was an ogre lady in Freeport crying in her beer because she couldn&#146;t 
  find a mate. Whatever happened to her?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> Well 
  you&#146;d have to ask Nepenthia about that. All I know is that one night I 
  saw the ogre lady and Nepenthia, skinny arm in fat arm, nearly rolling down 
  the street, singing a song that had a chorus something about males and pig&#146;s 
  tails and bash&#146;emgud. They stumbled into a bar and when I slipped in to 
  wangle a free beer, Nep already had her lute out and she and ogre lady were 
  singing, err hollering actually, a duet about getting laid. Well, blush, I won&#146;t 
  go into the details on that song. But you can bet there was a lot of attention 
  focused on the darling duo. Although, quite honestly, I think it was the novelty 
  of an ogre singing -- and not all that badly either -- that really got people 
  listening and not the ogre&#146;s hunt for a mate. However, I slipped outside 
  to inspect, err protect, a few pockets and when I got back, the ogre lady was 
  arm wrestling with the hairiest-toed halfling I&#146;ve ever seen and Nep was 
  batting those eyelashes at an extremely inebriated darkelf who seemed to think 
  she was his mother. *Shakes her head* Oh it was quite a night I tell you. But, 
  next morning, as I was sneaking&#133; err walking out the gate, I noticed ogre 
  lady ambling out toward the hills looking as close to a cat that got all the 
  cream as a pock-marked grotty ogre could manage. I think that ogre lady has 
  a new appreciation for bards&#146; songs now. And NO, I&#146;m not saying Nep 
  charmed the halfling. Oh no, not me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  Is it true Aradune had to bribe a gelatinous cube to spraypaint his name all 
  over the Qeynos catacombs?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> You think 
  I&#146;d touch that? What with green flaming swords appearing out of the ether 
  just on a whim? Whaddya think I am? Nuts? Well yeah, I am. Goes with my job. 
  Anyway, yeah, Aradune was sitting out under a tree in Qeynos one day and realized 
  he was totally tired of his goody-two-boots-and-flaming-sword image and decided 
  he wanted to go hip. Well hmm as hip as a ranger can imagine. I mean, there&#146;s 
  no way Karana&#146;s favorite would go dancing bare-chested in a Neriak bar, 
  is there? Well so he got to thinking about what a cool dood would do. (Took 
  him a minute to respell dude but he finally managed to overcome his innate good 
  taste in spelling.) Graffiti he thought, that&#146;s it -- I need to get some 
  spraypaint and get busy. Let&#146;s see, I can do &#147;DuNE waz here!&#148; 
  And maybe &#147;Mastah DuNE! He RoCKS!&#148; Yep, Ara was really getting into 
  the spirit of it and strolled into the shop for a can of green spray paint. 
  Well the shopkeeper, and I&#146;m not gonna name names, got huffy and told Aradune 
  he didn&#146;t sell THAT kind of thing. Aradune was momentarily discouraged 
  but you gotta remember this is a ranger and ranger&#146;s always get their &#133;. 
  well whatever it is they&#146;re looking for. So he headed down into the &#145;combs 
  and came across a cube slime-ing up the wall in green. Aha, he said (well hmmm 
  I kinda doubt Aradune would say Aha, but then again, this IS a story), just 
  the right color, you must be the fellow, err quivering mass of jello I was looking 
  for! Would you spray some graffiti for me? The gelatinous cube ignored him for 
  a bit, and then tumbled around to him and said, &#147;It&#146;ll cost ya Dood!&#148; 
  Aradune stood for a moment, probably debating gelatin flamb&eacute; against 
  hip grafitti while he considered the cube twisting and rocking there, and finally 
  said, &#147;Ok 10 gold for one, 19gold and 89 copper for two!&#148; &#147;Done&#148; 
  the cube cried and immediately started squeezing out the rough lettering for 
  the now-cool Aradune graffiti. Now you might want to know how I know this? Hah! 
  I&#146;ll never tell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  Why are all the sand giants male? Why aren't there any FEMALE giants? God knows 
  they can't have sprung up from ogre females... or can they ?</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> Well, 
  it&#146;s true all the sand giants you see are male and considering the girth 
  of their bellies and those ridiculous cowpies of cloth around their heads, you 
  gotta wonder if there used to be some female sand giants who took one look, 
  tucked up their skirts and ran away as fast as the little hummies and dorfs 
  do in Oasis. (Darn I listened to the ogre lady one song too many!) Ever run 
  between a giant&#146;s legs? Now that is even scarier than looking straight 
  on at one. And don&#146;t look up! Well, then again, nothing like one of those 
  bare chests to send any possible female giant screaming and running to hide 
  on the backside of the stone pillars. So, do the male sand giants come from 
  ogre females who spent one too many nights in an inn in Freeport? Could be! 
  I doubt it though. The sand giants either had very expensive orthodontia or 
  they came with naturally good teeth which would rule out the ogre genetic component 
  completely. The tale I heard about the birth of sand giants however, is an old 
  one. Way, way back when the high elves took dresses away from the half-elves, 
  it is said that the half-elven bards went stark raving crazy, ended up down 
  in the jungle and were never seen again. So sad, too bad, but then the tale 
  goes on to mention that nine months and seven days later, strangely clad giants 
  emerged from the jungle ready to wreak havoc on the world and its inhabitants, 
  particularly high elves with long snooty noses. The moral of the fable? Never 
  underestimate the ire of fashion-deprived half-elves. (Smoothes her pretty silk 
  robe and contemplates poor Nepenthia and her battleweary togs. Poor dear.) </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So m&#146;dears, 
  I&#146;ve gotten at least a start on the crucial bits of knowledge that make 
  Norrath the exciting place it is. If you have any more questions that are important
