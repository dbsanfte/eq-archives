<big><big>E</big></big>verQuest has generated a lot of interest in the past few months, and rightly so.  It stands to reason that many of you drawn into the excitement generated by EverQuest may be new to the roleplaying genre, and perhaps are unclear on exactly what roleplaying is.  Simply put, roleplaying is the ability to take on the role of an alternate persona, and to play that role interestingly and believably.  Roleplaying adds a new dimension, depth if you will, to an otherwise flat character.  In a sense, a good roleplayer must be a little bit actor, and a little bit fiction writer.  The first step to becoming a good roleplayer, therefore, is learning how to create an in-depth character that is fun to roleplay, and interesting to the other characters around you.  If you only know your character's race and class, then you don't really know enough about your character to roleplay him effectively.  In order to really breath life into your character, you must know about his personality, his background, any personal quirks he may have, his likes and dislikes, etc.  All this may sound like a lot of work, but the payoff is definitely a character that is more fun to play, and a heck of a lot more interesting to the other characters around you.

Once you know what race and class you'd like to use, a good place to start building the framework for the rest of your character is by creating his background.  I say background first instead of personality because a character's background can have a profound effect upon their personality.  For instance, if a half-elf character was abandoned by his elven father and left to be raised solely by his human mother, this would undoubtedly color his views of elves.  Maybe he distrusts elves, and even though he is half elf himself, he chooses to think of himself as human, completely denying his elven heritage.  Such a character would be wracked by self-conflict; conflict is what makes a good story, conflict can also add a lot of depth to a character.  Alternately, perhaps this character feels somehow responsible for his own abandonment and tries to prove his worth to any elf he meets.  Both of these possibilities are examples of backgrounds which would affect how the character will act in certain situations; a character with such a background will be more difficult to roleplay, but ultimately more rewarding.
<br><br>
Whereas background traits depend mostly upon the race of a character, personality traits usually depend on the class of a character.  This is because a person's personality is probably the primary determining factor in what profession he decides to pursue; unless he was forced into his profession by societal pressures or other factors.  A good example of this might be a pacifist barbarian boy who becomes a warrior because to do otherwise would bring dishonor to his clan.  Although such a character would be another example of one suffering from self-conflict as described above, I recommend against creating a character whose class conflicts with his personality because properly roleplaying them might curtail the advancement of the character.</td>

This doesn't mean, however, that all the members of a certain class have to be roleplayed with the same type of personality.  Remember that a class is nothing more than a label with certain skills and abilities attached to it.  Just because you must choose a class in order to create a character in EverQuest (I'm assuming), doesn't mean that you must roleplay a rogue strictly as a rogue, or a warrior strictly as a warrior.  A rogue character may consider himself to be a treasure hunter, or maybe he's a locksmith, or he could be a pickpocket, or a spy.  These characters may all have the same set of skills and abilities (to varying degrees), yet which skills they use, as well as how they use them depends upon exactly what they consider themselves to be.  A burglar would use his lockpicking ability to get into locked houses and stores to rob them; while a locksmith might use his lockpicking ability to run a little store where people can go if they want that locked chest they found on a goblin they killed opened.  These would be two completely different types of characters, one would be considered dishonorable and a nuisance, and the other would probably be considered a regular citizen who's providing a service to his community; yet they would both be rogues for purposes of the game.  Don't allow yourself to be boxed in by the limitations of the game, if you want your character to be a profession that's not available by name, select the class that gives you the skills of the profession you'd like to use and roleplay the character however you want.  That way you have a very wide latitude in deciding exactly how your character perceives his own profession, and how his personality relates to it.</p>
