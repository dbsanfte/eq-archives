When I started out to write this editorial, I wanted to rant about the Role-playing switch.  I think that Absor and I both feel the same way about the switch but perhaps I'll let Absor do the rant, and I'll instead ask the question; Why are there so many people willing to slam Verant with almost abusive posts about the game or gameplay issues?  I have noticed, over time, both on the Boards and news sites and links they post there, some pretty virulent comments about the game.
<br><br>
I am astounded at the amount of really vehement complaints I see about Verant, whether in game or on the boards. Where do these people get this deep sense of either self-righteousness or betrayal? I can probably safely say that I am one of the people who has had a significant amount of EQ experience, having been in EQ since phase one of beta, and yet my experience has been a very positive one. Am I just that much of an optimist? 
<br><br>
I understand people's frustrations with bugs, it's extremely annoying and can have you lose days and days of work. (I didn't touch Oghma for all of ph2 because he lost a slew of equipment at the very beginning of the phase, and it depressed me way too much to play him.) What I can't really fathom is how really intense the anti-Verant sentiment sometimes is. You'd think that Verant had asked for the inclusion of a comic-relief character named Jar-Jar in The Phantom Menace, or worse! Is it just that Verant is a convenient target? 
<br><br>
I have had a fair amount of interaction with Verant staff, and to a person, they are dedicated to this game and fair-minded about others' opinions. Brad in particular I have seen come to an online meeting and completely turn around people who were very upset with him with his open-mindedness and willingness to listen. As individuals, I think pretty highly of Verant, and as a group, I think they have shown over and over their dedication to the game. 
<br><br>
I think it may be true that expectations were pretty high. This was supposed to be THE ANSWER for MMORPGS, and everyone was supposed to find role-playing and gaming nirvana therein.  I don't know that I expected the game to be as immersive as it was, but at the same time full of reminders of RL in the displays of bad manners that other players have. I have had a fair amount of MUD experience, so I guess I expected it to be fairly mud-like, with graphics thrown in.  
<br><br>
Maybe some folks expected that their own lives would be so enriched because of the opportunities available in Norrath that they would become happier people? I know that the need for escape is a powerful one, and Norrath offers a very powerful form of it. Perhaps it isn't escape enough, because of the RL jerks who bring it into the game. 
<br><br>
Many role-players feel betrayed by Verant, I guess, because they feel not enough was done to encourage role-playing.  I don't think that there is a lack of role-playing insight in Verant's staff. I have played in Norrath with a few of the staff and they role-play very well. I think that there are limitations in the very concept of role-playing that make it impossible to encourage beyond what Verant has already done without making it some form of Role-playing Nazism. You just can't MAKE people role-play, and you can't make role-players play the way YOU role-play. That Verant even tried to include a sloppy fix like a "role-playing switch" is indicative of their willingness to try anything to encourage role-playing. 
<br><br>
What I do find heartening is the fact that there IS a debate. There ARE people who care, and voice their opinions no matter how much I disagree with their opinions or their grammar. One of the things that I find attractive is that my entire EQ experience is colored by the thoughts and opinions of some very insightful people, whose writings add to the way I perceive both the game and life.  - And the funny thing is - Verant reads both the well written and the poorly written ones.
