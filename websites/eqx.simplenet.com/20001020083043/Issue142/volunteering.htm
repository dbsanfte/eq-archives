  <b>ARE THRIVING ONLINE COMMUNITIES IN DANGER? </b></font></div>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  past week a friend send me an icq message with a link to an article on a new 
  lawsuit filed in Colorado against Ultima Online on behalf of its volunteers 
  who supposedly were enslaved in a virtual sweatshop, laboring unpaid on behalf 
  of Electronic Arts&#146; bottom line. Not long ago, I also followed the links 
  on the Vault to articles about a similar suit against AOL alleging it too had 
  mistreated its volunteers by not paying them in order to pad its already fabulous 
  bottom line. While the suits so far seem focused on creating economic gain for 
  the &#147;used-to-be-volunteers&#148; plaintiffs and their lawyers, it seems 
  likely that other suits will follow, each attempting to apply non-virtual law 
  to limit nearly all aspects of virtual community, impoverishing the thriving 
  environments we creatively participate in. It seems as if yet another battle 
  has been joined in the war between those who would try to create and support 
  lively and free communities online (even using for-profit sites to do so) and 
  those who are trying to remold the internet into a strictly business environment 
  using a variety of motivations, such as the revenge and greed shown in the above 
  volunteer cases, to invoke laws and governmental restrictions solely for economic 
  benefit with no regard for the impact it may have on the communities that are 
  trying to develop and grow online.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
  seems to me that what is happening is that those involved in these moneygrabs 
  are not distinguishing between the corporate body that develops and maintains 
  a site, such as a game world or chat rooms, and the community body that creates 
  itself within the boundaries of a particular virtual environment. They are, 
  however, two distinct bodies. A company such as Verant can provide all the coding 
  and content it wishes and sell it. It cannot, however, simply create a community 
  and sell it too. A community such as the one growing among the players of EverQuest, 
  has its own distinct existence and its members should not be assumed to be concerned 
  with Verant&#146;s profit when they bring the site to life with their presence 
  and contributions. Members of the community may choose to beta test, report 
  bugs, build support sites, create content ideas and give them to Verant to implement 
  if it so decides, volunteer to help players, write articles, poems, stories 
  and make art and music about the world they inhabit. There is no requirement 
  that they do so in order to use the game they bought, but these are the very 
  kinds of acts that develop community in real life as well as on the internet. 
  The members of a community such as that on EverQuest have chosen to participate 
  in a particular virtual world and to accept the rules and restrictions that 
  bind that virtual world. Everything an individual adds to that fantasy world, 
  whether it is simply play and character development or whether it includes solid 
  committed volunteer efforts, rests on a foundation of freedom to choose whether 
  or not they wish to contribute to the development of the separate community. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
  individual choice to contribute to community so far exists, although somewhat 
  hindered, in the real world. People can and do contribute volunteer efforts 
  to for-profit, non-profit and governmental bodies on behalf of their surrounding 
  communities and they have done so for centuries. Why then, are online communities, 
  as well as the companies providing the sites where virtual communities grow, 
  under these particular attacks? The issues raised in the two lawsuits seem to 
  hinge on the idea that a for-profit environment should not be allowed to also 
  include within its boundaries a thriving and contributing community. With that 
  in view, the lawsuits say that all activity taking place within the environment 
  should be regulated as part of a singular corporate entity, essentially relegating 
  all those who volunteer their time and energy within a perceived community to 
  a state of mindless and irresponsible peonage whose contributions must be measured 
  only by a minimum wage scale. Imagine the old days when a barn-raising would 
  call in all the surrounding neighbors for the eventual profit of one farmer. 
  What if those neighbors had been required to receive a day&#146;s wages as the 
  sole repayment for supporting and helping each other. Imagine, today, the volunteers 
  in for-profit and non-profit hospitals around the country contributing to the 
  wellbeing of their community members. What if they are then told that their 
  contributions can only be measured against an economic standard for the hospital, 
  not on the benefits their friends and neighbors have received.<br>
  <br>
  What bothers me is that these lawsuits, in their rush to apply economic tests 
  and laws to a volunteer ethic, seem to be assaulting the right of each person 
  to choose the communities they wish to support and help build. In the long run, 
  if suits like these succeed, they will change the enjoyment of and connections 
  available from our online communities. They will quite likely further harm even 
  our real life opportunities to add our individual creativity and concern to 
  the communities that offer so much to both ourselves and our fellow players. 
  These suits certainly put a chill on our potential involvement with our online 
  environments.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Put 
  in online terms, these suits are saying that a person who goes on-line to help 
  other people enjoy a virtual environment they mutually share, particularly if 
  the site is provided by a for-profit company, must be paid because his or her 
  contributions may benefit the company that created and maintains the environment. 
  The lawyers claim this is so even if the reason those contributions are made 
  is for the benefit of the community and not the profitability of the company. 
  No attention whatsoever is being paid to the fact that the person volunteering, 
  in whatever capacity, might be doing so for enjoyment, for altruistic reasons, 
  for developing skills in one environment that might be useful later on in another, 
  or for finding in the environment a creative muse. None of this has anything 
  to do with a motivation to enrich the company which has provided the online 
  environment. Even if that company chooses to support volunteer and creative 
  efforts made on behalf of the community existing on its site, it is still crucial 
  that people have the right and ability to decide where they will spend their 
  extra time and whether they choose or not choose to give of that time to others 
  with similar interests.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
  professors of law were quoted online as saying that these suits do not hold 
  enough substance to prevail because labor laws were designed only to protect 
  those who economically rely on an employer. As I look around and consider what 
  I have seen online in years of mudding and playing EQ, it seems to me that I 
  have not observed players who volunteer expecting to make any money from their 
  efforts (noting, of course, the E-Bayers who have chosen to create an illegal 
  black market in selling game attributes and whose activities should not affect 
  the economic reliance question). What I have experienced are players who enjoy 
  a game community and environment so much they want to add their own ideas, time 
  and energy to building and supporting it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
  these lawsuits are also attempting to say is that any online companies should 
  either have to pay for or else turn down all of the ideas and offers of assistance 
  made to benefit the internet communities developing on their sites. Thus, the 
  very ethic of sharing and contributing that has made the internet, as a whole, 
  strong and vibrant is under attack because a few people have decided that the 
  words &#147;community&#148; and &#147;volunteer&#148; have no other definition 
  other than &quot;I wanna get mine or I&#146;ll close your site down&quot;! It 
  seems important that both the companies who sell virtual environments where 
  communities thrive and the people who care about those communities have some 
  way to stand forth and simply support an internet where volunteers can continue 
  to act to help our communities grow and do well. I would hope that those who 
  seek to limit our opportunities to do so would stop and think about the damage 
  they are doing to the online expressions of the volunteer ethic. </font> </p>
