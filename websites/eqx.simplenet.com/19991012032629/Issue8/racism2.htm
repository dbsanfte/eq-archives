A dwarf is raised in a mountain stronghold, never seeing members of other races, living his/her life hearing about the faults of other races without getting a chance to experience them.  Everything s/he hears tells them that orcs are thugs and murderers, elves are snooty effetes, and halflings are gluttonous cowards who don’t stand and "fight like a dwarf".  The dwarf then goes out into the wide world carrying these opinions, and encounters his first elf. Fireworks!  That snooty little poof looked down at ME?!?. (loud scuffling noises ensue)

If the dwarf interacted more with the elf, then we would see if he was a true bigot or not.  Bigotry isn’t necessarily racial.  It’s unreasonable intolerance in the face of counter-indicative facts.  Let’s have this interaction between this elf and dwarf progress further, and say the elf is a little more understanding of the dwarf’s initial reaction, and they become friends.  If the dwarf then carried on his intolerance of elves, he would be a bigot (or a slow learner ;) ).  This allows the character room to develop into a better, more enlightened individual within the confines of a fantasy society.  It’s an excellent role-playing hook to hang a character concept on.

Racial intolerances are part of an overall character concept.  It allows us to define our characters in ways that build a world structure, a shared history that everyone understands. If we didn’t know what to expect from an orc, how will we know how to react to it when we see it?  While we can, of course despise bigotry in the "real" world, it can serve as a useful tool to define the world around our characters.  It all comes down to character concept.  We choose who our characters are, from class and race down to equipment and hair color.  When we choose a race, we choose the history of that race, to inform us how that race views that world, and how to react to it.  That’s not to say that an enlightened orc will never exist, but it should be role-played across the career of the character, and be a painful process, as it is when we, ourselves, divest ourselves of intolerance.
