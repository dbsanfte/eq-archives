My Dear Oghma,
  <br><br>
    I'd like to thank you for your well thought out and presented editorials.  I
	especially enjoyed reading your most recent <a href="../Issue61/religion1.htm">consideration</a> about the "World
	Views" of the Tier'Dal.  I just recently decided to explore my "dark" side, and found it quite challenging to effectively portray a haughty, hostile, spiteful Dark Elf without falling into the stereotypical "PK @sshole" role.  It's actually harder than playing a "good" character, as it requires me to balance a decent person at the keyboard with a homicidal paranoiac xeno-hostile persona.  ( If I want to frag people, I play Half-life, but in Norrath, I try to focus on roleplaying. ) Anyhow, thanks again.
<br><br>
"Hey, back off Moluk, that dwarf's had enough..." - last words of a Tier'Dal who just couldn't make the cut.

I would like to say I found you <a href="../Issue61/qanda.htm">QnA</a> section in EQ Express 61 rather disturbing. Your answer to the question about this disadvantages of halflings was not even close to helpful and was closer to very rude. I'm not sure why but you totally shot way out there and severly slandered halflings. I bet if this was a question about humans or elves you would not have been so harsh. Lastly i wouls like to say that halflings are very proud of thier foot hair and we suffer no side affects mentioned in this answer.

As a regular reader and supporter of EverQuest Express I must tell you that I am rather irate about this week's <a href="../Issue61/qanda.htm">Q&A</a> section.  This weekly feature has always been a forum for EQ enthusiasts to ask questions concerning the game and to get serious and professional answers from your staff, namely Wynn.  Don't those of us that play Halflings have a difficult enough time with the "d00d" jokes without us having to read Wynn's response to question #12? The sender of this question made a straightforward and serious query and it was answered with a somewhat puerile joke-type response.  I'm all for humor and parody, but in the appropriate format.  A formerly serious Q&A section of a reputable "newspaper" is not such a format.  I currently lead a large and active Halfling clan that is an officially registered guild in the EverQuest beta and I can tell you, we of the Vale Patrol are most distressed by such a flippant attitude toward our chosen race by once such an esteemed oranization.  We are asking for no less than a public apology and/or retraction of the offending article portion.  The link to your page that once graced the Vale Patrol's page will be removed until such an event takes place and the membership of the Vale Patrol will no longer support your organization until our request for an apology is met.  Thank you for your time.

<em>We are pleased to hear from two members of H.O.B.B.I.T.T, Halflings Organized for Better Behavior In The Tall.  Speaking as a dwarf, I well know the slings an arrows oft suffered by those who believe that anything below their waist is insignificant.  Having seen these individuals at waist height, I can guarantee that that what is below THEIR waists is truly insignificant, in every sense of the term.

It is our policy here at Everquest Express not to publish spoilers, or discuss game strategies which remove the role-playing from the game and rise to the level of power-gaming strategies. As such the question on the advantages and disadvantages of a particular race takes the "concept" out of the character, and is indeed more of a l33t dewd question than a role-playing query.  As such we decided that a satiric response was in order.  If you are indeed an avid reader, you can see that we have referred to many races in many varying terms.  As the dwarf of the staff, I am frequently called upon to keep my sense of humor despite the jokes of the Tall Folk, and I would not presume to think that the EQX staff in any way truly deprecates anyone on the basis of their race.  We have played this game since August playing many races and classes. Wynn in particular loves to play halflings, and had an Phase 1 halfling rogue that rocked the Misty Forest.
<br><br>
My sincerest condolences on the loss of your sense of humor.
<br><br>

I've been checking in at the EQX page here and there since I've discovered EQ
but I'd really like to compliment the artwork of Jason Chan and Nepenthia's
ballads. Nepenthia's works both had me cracking up and her essay was
interesting. Concerning Jason Chan's artwork, I loved the two Wood Elf
ones, since I play a Wood Elf in the game. This is a lot of nice work.
Thanks for such an enjoyable page.

How about a compilation of all the Q & A's or a search feature?

Onyx,

I believe the message from TwoHead reads "We will kill you if we can".  Graphic representation of alphabet!

Hope this helps
