Soon after seating myself in my  accustomed place I  took stock of those 
gathered. Only a fellowship in the corner drew my attention as the 
others were familiars.
<br><br>
By the firelight I could distinguish that all seated most certainly were 
adventurers.  If they had ever called a town home then they were surely 
far away from it.  It seemed there was a heated discussion and soon 
their  banter began to cause distress amongst the patrons. Calmly, I 
struck up a conversation with my cousin at my side.  I was careful so as

Many quickly found the exits while others stood as if frozen in ice.

In the instant I heard a chuckle from the smaller of her companions I 
also witnessed the black sword withdrawn from the crumbled rock. The 
warrior sat far back in his chair with the blade at his throat. "Nay, I 
did not mean to insult you mighty Serat.  It is only that you have many 
weapons and that I, a lowley warrior have but few. You have your beauty 
as well as your sword. I admit, I concede, I am envious. I am as jealous
