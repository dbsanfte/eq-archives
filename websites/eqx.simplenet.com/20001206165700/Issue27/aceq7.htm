From Brad McQuaid: Producer for EverQuest.
<br><br>
Thanks much for the article on EQ vs. AC -- was a very interesting read.  I
feel compelled, however, to make a few minor points or clarifications about
the EQ interface that might not have been apparent to a player at E3.

<em>EverQuest's system of macros (or hotkeys) and quick buttons for spells is
a wonderful addition to the standard keyboard interfaces we typically run
into. However, there are some problems that I mentioned in earlier articles.
The skill listing spans several screen heights, and is difficult to take in
quickly.</em>

Characters at E3 were given just about every skill upon creation - this in
order to show off the many skills the game does offer.  Normally, unless very
high level (and thus already very familiar with all of the skills), one
wouldn't have so many to scroll through.
