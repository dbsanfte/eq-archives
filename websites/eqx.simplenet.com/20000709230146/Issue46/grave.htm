Aye, that's me.  I'm a gravedigger.  Been one since as long as I can recall.  Well, that's not entirely true, I was a young kid once.  Don't remember what I did then.  But ever since I started working, I've been a gravedigger.
<br><br>
Good at my job, I am.  Forty years I've been a gravedigger and now I'm the chief gravedigger of Cabbot.  Cabbot's a small city in eastern Karana, a small city with a lot of graves.  You see, the people of Cabbot don't live very long.  In between the ogre raids and the passing plagues, we have a lot of deaths.  That's not a problem though, it keeps me busy.
<br><br>
Some people think the being a gravedigger is a wretched job.  It's not though.  I get to meet a lot of people.  Sure, they're always sad, but who isn't in this awful world?  Well, me.  I love my job.  Now that I'm the chief gravedigger, I get paid even more for the job I love.  What a world!  With pride I say my name, "Chief Gravedigger Gwid."
<br><br>
Speaking of interesting people, I met one of them a couple of years ago.  That's why I guess I'm writing this story: to tell the story of this most important person.
<br><br>
I was digging graves about two weeks ago.  You see, the next day there was to be two funerals.  Sad case, both of them.  A young boy who died of the coughing disease and the other, a young man with kids who was ripped to shreds by wolves.  In any event, some one had to dig their graves.
<br><br>
I like to work late at night when I dig graves.  It's so peaceful and quiet, kind of makes you glad to be alive.  (Those poor bums that I bury don't know what they're missing.)  No one ever bothers me at night.  In fact, no one comes to the cemetery at night.  That's why I was so surprised to see two fellas standing over a grave that night.
<br><br>
The first was a tall man; I'd say well over six feet.  I couldn't see very well in the dark, but he looked pretty husky.  His clothes looked pretty nice from what I could see.  Probably lost a wife or something.
<br><br>
But the other fella was a strange-looking bloke.  He couldn't have been more than four feet.  He was wearing some strange kinda clothing too.  It wasn't all that pretty, but then again, I was wearing mud, dirt and burlap.  But I decided then and there that these two must be vandals, so I acted the only way I should have: I jumped out of the grave, brandished my shovel and yelled, "'ey! Who the 'ell are you?!"
<br><br>
Guess they didn't know I was there, because the two blokes turned as if to run.  Then, from the light of the lantern the tall man held I recognized one of them.  "Alderman Berben, sorry to bother you, sir," I called out.
<br><br>
"That is alright…, uh….," the tall man replied.  "I seem to have forgotten your name, good sir."
<br><br>
"Gwid, sir.  Chief Gravedigger Gwid, sir."
<br><br>
"Ahhh, Gwid, good," the tall man said and motioned to me to come to him.  "Come over here, I would like you to meet someone."
<br><br>
So I did as I was told.  After all, this fella was the one who paid me.  Once I got up close to them, I could see that the short man had a huge nose.  He also had white hair and a crazy white beard.  I mean, that hair was all over the place.  "Hi," I said.
<br><br>
"Pleasedtomeetyou," the short fella quickly replied.
<br><br>
"Huh?"
<br><br>
The short fella sighed, and repeated what he had said, much slower this time, "Pleased to meet you."
<br><br>
Alderman Berben put one my hand on my shoulder and flourished with the other toward the short bloke.  "Gwid, allow me to introduce Alfreer, gnomish scientist.  He has just moved to Cabbot to conduct his experiments."
<br><br>
Now, I had no clue what a scientist was or did, and I'd never seen a gnome before.  My friend told me that they were ugly.  And Alfreer was ugly, so I guess all the other things I'd had heard about gnomes were true.  I wonder if they really eat dogs?
<br><br>
Alderman Berben had continued speaking while I was lost in thought.  Only when he said, "Alfreer will be coming to the cemetery every now and again," did I return to the world of the alive.
<br><br>
"Why do you need to come 'ere?"
<br><br>
"Bodiesareveryimportanttomyresearch.ThemoreIhavethefasterIcancompletemywork."
<br><br>
I didn't catch a word of what he said, but didn't feel like asking him to say it again.  I was sure that whatever he said was of no concern to me.
<br><br>

<br><p style="text-align: justify">
A week passed before I saw Alfreer.  Again, it was a night when I saw him next.  This time he also had a large person with him, but it wasn't Alderman Berben.  The big bloke had a shovel in his hand and a pile of dirt was next to him.  Putting two and two together, I realized that Alfreer was stealing a body.  When I had become Chief Gravedigger, I swore to protect all the bodies under my care.  And I was not going to fail now.
<br><br>
"'ey!  What the 'ell do you think yer doing?" I said while brandishing my shovel.
<br><br>
Alfreer turned around and looked at me.  "Gwidgoodtoseeyou!" he said with a grin on his face.
<br><br>
"Put the body back, Alfreer.  I don't want no trouble."
<br><br>
"IcannotGwid.Ineedthebodyformyresearch.Pleaseunderstand.Idonotwantohurtyou."
<br><br>
"Put it back, Alfreer, or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.  And if you don't leave, I'm gonna have to force you out."
<br><br>
"Gwiddonotdosomethingstupid.Idonotwanttohurtyou."
<br><br>
It was at this time that the big fella leaned over to Alfreer and whispered something into his ear.  Alfreer paused for a second before he began to nod enthusiastically.  Pleased, the big bloke dropped his shovel and began to lumber over to me.  "Okay, we'll put the body back," the big man said.  He had a shrill voice and I cringed when he spoke.  "But we're taking you with us!" he roared with a high-pitched squeal that was probably his laugh.
<br><br>
Before I could react, the big man threw some dust in my face.  I sneezed a couple of times and then felt sick.  In agony, I collapsed to the ground and suddenly the world went black around me.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
When I woke up, I found that I was restrained.  I was lying on some table, with several bands of leather holding me in place.  The room around me was made of stuff.  There were several tables nearby with odd tools placed on them.  All of them were sharp and had pointy edges.  Afraid for my life, I struggled to get out of my prison for several minutes before I realized I was too weak.  Desperately, I cried for help.  "'ey!  'elp me!  'elp!  Please 'elp me!"
<br><br>
I cried for several minutes before someone came.  My heart sank when I saw it was the big man who threw dust in my face.  "Stop screaming," he whined.  "Master doesn't like the screaming."
<br><br>
"'elp!  'elp!"  I keep yelling.
<br><br>
"Stop, please stop," he pathetically whined.  "If I get you something to drink, will you stop?"
<br><br>
I stopped yelling.  I was very thirsty and it didn't look like anyone would come and save me.  "Okay," I replied.
<br><br>
The big man's face lit up.  "Good, very good," he said in his squeaky voice.  He clapped and yelled down the hall, "Some good ale please."
<br><br>
We sat, or laid in my case, there and stared at each other for several minutes.  Neither of us said a word.  Then I heard the sound of shuffling footsteps from down the hall.  Whewww, I thought, I'm really thirsty too.
<br><br>
That was when the servant appeared.  At first I didn't see anything wrong.  He was carrying a tray that had a frosty mug of ale on it.  In fact, everything seemed fine until I saw his hands.  They were made of bone!  I then looked at the rest of the servant until I saw that it was a skeleton!  Terrified, I screamed like a little girl.
<br><br>
This caused the big man to start squealing again.  The louder I screamed, the louder his squeal was.  This continued for almost a minute before Alfreer made his appearance.
<br><br>
"Helperwhatisallthecommotioninhere?"
<br><br>
The big man stopped squealing and bowed his head.  "Nothing, master.  Gwid just got scared by the servant, that's all."
<br><br>
"Scaredbytheservant?OhIsee.NowthatIknowthatisfine.Whywouldhebescaredbytheservantinthefirstplace?"
<br><br>
Before anyone could answer his question (I assumed it was a question, but I had no idea what he said), Alfreer realized that I was awake.
<br><br>
"Gwid!" he cried.  "Goodtoseeyouarebackwithusintherealworld," he paused and hurried over to my side.  "IhaveapropositionforyouGwid.Howwouldyouliketobesmart?"
<br><br>
Confused by his words, or lack of as far as I was concerned, I replied the best I could.  "Huh?"
<br><br>
"Iknewyouwouldagree.Helperifyouwouldplease."
<br><br>
"Yes, Master," the big man said.  He leaned over me and whispered, "You'll be happier when you wake up."  With that he dropped some more dust on my face and all went black again.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
I woke up to find myself in a pitch-black room.  I couldn't see any walls, ceiling or floor.  There was only… nothing.  Noticing that I was on the floor I stood up and flexed my limbs.  Gawd, I'm sore.  From that point on, things started to get weird.
<br><br>
First a rat scurried by, brushing against my leg as he passed.  I quickly jumped back since everyone knows that rats cause the coughing disease.  "Damn rat," I said while shaking my fist at the passing beast.
<br><br>
"What did the rat do to you?" a voice from the darkness called.
<br><br>
"Who's there?" I said.  Fear started to grip my heart.  "Show yourself."
<br><br>
"Fine," the voice replied.  Suddenly people started coming out of the darkness and formed a circle around me.  I looked at all of their faces and realized that I knew all of these people.  Former bosses and coworkers, current and past underlings, the few friends I've had, a few people I've talked to more than once and even Alderman Berben were there.  "Why do you seek intelligence, Gwid?" Alderman Berben asked.
<br><br>
"Eh?" I said.  I had no clue what he was talking about.
<br><br>
"We're not good enough for you, are we, Gwid?" a former boss said.
<br><br>
Confused I started dancing in circles to find a way out of this circle.
<br><br>
"There's no escape, Gwid.  We'll always be with you and remember you for who you are," my favorite underling said.  With that, all of the assembled joined hands and started circling me.  They were singing some horrible song and began moving faster and faster.  Within a minutes they had reached such a fast speed that they were just a blur.
<br><br>
"Stop!" I cried.  "Stop that!"  After I spoke, the circle began to slow down.  Soon they came to a complete stop, but they were not the same people.  In their places, stood horrific looking skeletons.  Their hollow eye sockets held pinpoints of red light.  They stared at me for several seconds before charging me, their pointy fingers raised in a striking position.
<br><br>
I awoke from my sleep screaming.  My hands went up to shield my face from the skeletons that only existed in my dream.  Suddenly I realized two things.  First, that there were no skeletons and second, I was no longer restrained.  Looking around I saw that Alfreer and Helper were standing next to me.
<br><br>
"How do you feel, Gwid?" Alfreer said.
<br><br>
"A little light-headed, but pretty good overall."  Almost as an after thought I added, "Thanks for speaking slowly."
<br><br>
Alfreer's face lit up in a huge grin.  "Success!" he cried.  "Gwid, I'm not speaking any slower than usual.  You are just smarter.  You can understand what I say."
<br><br>
I sat at the table and thought about what he said for several seconds.  He was right, I did feel smarter.  I'm not sure how one feels smarter, but I certainly did.  I turned to Alfreer and shook his hand.  "Thank you, Alfreer.  Now I can do whatever I want because I'm smart.  Thank you very much."  I rose from the table and began walking out the door.
<br><br>
Suddenly a large hand grabbed my shoulder.  "Not so fast, Gwid," I heard Helper say.  "Master made you smart for a reason."
<br><br>
"He is right, Gwid.  I have recently written a book about the brain.  Happily, sages, scientists and other great thinkers across Norrath have ordered a copy.  Unfortunately, I cannot hope to make enough copies.  That is why I made you smart, Gwid.  No you can read and write.  To pay me for this great gift I gave you, you are going to copy my book, word for word, until everyone who wants a copy has one.  That is only fair, right Gwid?" Alfreer said with a grin.
<br><br>
"Noooooooooooooooooooooooo!" I cried out in horror.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
So for the past three years I have copied Alfreer's book.  This is the cruelest form of torture ever devised by mankind: I am forced to read a book about the brain over and over and over.  I have never read anything with less excitement in my life (and now that I can read, I do so whenever I have a moment of free time).  I almost envy Servant now.  He is beyond hating his job, he just does what he is told and doesn't care either way.  Oh, how I long to be a simple gravedigger again.  I don't even care about being Chief Gravedigger anymore, I would kill to be the lowliest gravedigger again.  In fact, I just might..  Maybe, just maybe, I can put this penknife to good use after all.  In all that is holy, I would love to rid myself of Master.
