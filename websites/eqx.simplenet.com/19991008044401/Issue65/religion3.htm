<B><I>Author’s note</B>: As most races have gods associated with a profession, I am going to continue this series of articles after I complete the races with a series of articles on the gods of profession.  What I am trying to do with the races and gods articles in this series is to show what the main religious focus of a race could be. - Oghma

<I>‘The planet that would be called Norrath was divvied up between these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina. And on the surface of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and beauty, and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce and formidable beings, intent upon the defense of their lands. Thus began the Elder Age</I>.’

&#9;Dwarves are another race, like the dark elves, that have a clear racial creator.  Brell Serilis is one of the most powerful gods in the Norrathian pantheon, having been the first to reach Norrath after Veeshan.  He is also the great negotiator/trickster in his efforts to maintain his hold over Norrath, if you read later on in the creation myth.  A difficulty with Brell, however, is his very power to create also dilutes the &quot;special&quot; feeling of being one of his creations.  Exactly how many of Brell’s &quot;children&quot; are there?  Dozens?  Hundreds?
<br><br>
The effect of multiple race creations, on the Dwarven culture, may be far-reaching.  There may be a feeling of &quot;why did Brell do more when he hit the jackpot with dwarves&quot;?  Was Brell’s design truly to protect Norrath from Veeshan, or was he truly in love with the process of creation?  Or, worse than that, was Brell a god who creates and then leaves his creations in the lurch?
<br><br>
Dwarves follow their god in his creative ways.  They are master smiths and crafters of works of incredible beauty and durability.  As Brell seeded Norrath’s underground with his creatures, Dwarves seed Norrath with their marvelous creations.  Dwarves, however, take a fierce pride in their accomplishments, which is evident to all, maybe perhaps too evident.  Brell, however, has the appearance of having abandoned his creations to their own devices.
<br><br>
On further examination, however, Brell appears to really want to ensure the supremacy of his creations, by further creating pacts which allow them greater control of the Below.  Unfortunately, the Below is getting crowded, which is why further ages acted to limit the creations allowed on Norrath, through wars and genocide.  Dwarves do believe, however that the upper world is not as important as Down Below.
<br><br>
Dwarf society views the surface world much like we would view another continent.  Things that happen there are interesting, perhaps, but really not important.  Their god is the god of Below, where things that matter happen.  Everything that a dwarf could want is below – metals, gems, heat, and gold.  While it’s true that hops grow better in sunlight, you at least don’t need to go far from Kaladim to harvest them…
<br><br>
This is what gives Dwarves their insular worldview.  To them, any other race in the above world, like Elves, Humans, and the like, simply aren’t as important as Dwarves.  The underground races, such as gnomes, Dark Elves, and the humanoid gnolls, are either competitors for underground resources, or not the first-born of Brell, and therefore not as important as the first-born dwarves.
<br><br>
Myth and Ritual time
<br><br>
Dwarves are great believers in the power of ritual, since their acts of creation require ritual-like exactitude and focus.  The heating and quenching of steel, the hammering of the blade on the anvil, all these have a holy significance to dwarven craftsmen. Ritual time is time set aside by priesthood to venerate the gods, to focus attention on the sacred, and to give structure to time and space where there was little or none before.
<br><br>
When we normally think of ritual, we think of a system of rites or a formal act or series of acts.  But ritual time is more than that, since it includes days like Mardi Gras, Halloween, and Easter.  These are times where a heightened awareness of spirituality and the events important to a religion are celebrated.
<br><br>
The basic feature of ritual is its ability to focus time and space.  It is time deliberately devoted to a special purpose.  It is not necessarily a subdued focus, however.  The Bacchanalia of Dionysus (Bacchus, the Roman name of the Greek god, was given to the festival in Roman times) was a wild orgy of wine, women and song… in that order.
<br><br>
A second important feature is its tangibility; it’s ability to act as a display.  By being more than spoken words or a scribble on a dusty tome, it makes it’s statements as action, and gives it a broader framework of meaning and potential for expression.  The passion plays of the medieval Christian Church were both entertainment, and a lesson in the Bible.
<br><br>
Ritual is also important as to whom it excludes or includes.  A ritual for a select group builds an in-group feeling and a feeling of power, whereas a broadly open ritual is designed to add more people into the fold.  Ritual in this sense can be important not only as a religious event, but also as a tool for guilds to increase membership or to recognize achievement.
<br><br>
As role-players, we like to have ritual in the game, without having to actually do it, or make it up.  Who really wants to walk three steps, bow, walk three steps, and say holy words? Ritual, however, adds to the immersive feeling that we want out of EverQuest, and gives structure and meaning to even tiny acts, like a celebration of a level attained, or the defeat of an unholy foe.  Festival days can add structure to the world by reminding us who the Gods are and what their struggles were.  Surely, the day that Innoruuk stole the King and Queen of the Elves is a day to be both celebrated and despised, and the creation of the Dark Elves would be an important day to remind us of both the event and why the races hate each other so.
<br><br>
Festival days may also be days where certain acts could be enhanced.  A holy day of Brell may add success to smithing and or tinkering.  Innoruuk’s day could result in a weakening of the non-Tier'dal in Nektulos, or increased spawns of undead.  Days of especial importance could be added as part of the creation process, a modifier for success or failure.  Would a dwarven hammer built on Cazic-Thule’s day be as strong?  Would it even succeed?
<br><br>
What we need now is a religious calendar for Norrath.   While we have a few bits and pieces of the myth and history of Norrath. Hopefully, we’ll be able to see from Verant a way to give structure to the world of myth they have created by having holy days and festivals.  If not, we’ll have to make ‘em up!
