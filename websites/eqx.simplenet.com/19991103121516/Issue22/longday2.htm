Blackness, emptiness, soothed and consoled her.  The void of nothingness, where no
pain, no anxiety, reached her.  Slowly the darkness took shape, blurring into a dull
grey image, and Lilan became aware of the first sounds to reach her since the ordeal
had begun.  It came rushing back in bits and pieces; each new noise and new blurry,
confused image that pierced her mind brought a flash of the painful memory back.  But
where was she going when <em>it</em> happened?  What was she doing?  She could not recall so
many things for some reason, and she had no idea how much time had passed....

She became aware of how cold her face was.  Cold and sore.  She cracked her eyelids
open to reveal a dark stone before her, against the side of her cheek.  As she
blinked to focus she became acutely aware of the scent of incense and the stench of
burnt flesh.  <em>What is this?</em>

"Arise, servant!" shrieked an odd voice.  Lilan summoned the strength to lift her
head and gazed at the source.  It was an odd creature, thin, pale, and wrinkled...
"In accordance with the Rituals, I bring thee forth to do my bidding!"
It had no hair on its head, but only a thin few strands along the sides of its head,
which was so obscene...  There were no horns!  No scales or plates, only a grossly
smooth, tan skin.  Lilan shuddered in horror as she looked into the thing's eyes,
which blinked in fury.  <em>It has round pupils...</em> she thought in disgust as it
spoke again.  "Zsikthian Demon, I bring you forth on this plane to do my bidding for
a term of no less than 24 hours!"  <em>This was going to be a long day...</em>
