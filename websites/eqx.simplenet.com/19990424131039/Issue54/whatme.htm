Go back to your holes!  No Spoilers to be had here!!!
<br><br>
"Hmmm," they fume and grumble, "Then why did he title the article that?"
<br><br>
Well, if I titled it RUN FOR YOUR LIFE… IT'S TALK ABOUT THE SWITCH! then I'd never get anybody to read this article.  And it's chock full of good information and 100% PK Free!
<br><br>
If you bother to read EQX at all then you are most likely already familiar with the phrase PK (Player Killer), but I'll elaborate.  It's someone who has the ability to kill other players and in turn be killed.  Doesn't sound so bad eh?  In certain games there is a problem with players running about slaying new players (Newbies).  And the so-called "switch" is 989's means of combating this problem.  The "switch" is a metaphor.  You are either a "PK" player or you are switched "Non-PK" and no player can hurt you.
<br><br>
Review over.  Now onto new ground!  With all the Pre-beta discussion of the switch it has become rather surprising to me that none of the few websites who have freedom to print information about EverQuest have yet tackled this subject.
<br><br>
Without disclosing the means by with you set your "switch position" (PK or NON-PK) I will try to elaborate on how the Great Switch Experiment is going!
<br><br>
The concept is that all characters who chose to be PK can fight with each other at will.  Non-PK characters can still fight with each other, but only if they consent to a duel.
<br><br>
Does it work?  Yes, I must say it does.  I tested the duel function in the last day of beta phase 2.  I hadn't given it a thought before then, but now I was feeling reckless, since this character would be wiped out anyway.  So as I come across a dark elf I make fun of his height and he challenges me to a duel.  He's much stronger than I am (two levels higher) but it doesn't matter.  I just want to do this.
<br><br>
Away we go!  And down I go.   I died, but I feel very pleased.  There was even a bystander there to witness my lonely death deep in a cave.  In other words, it had all the makings of a great Role-playing scene.
<br><br>
Sometimes you are targeting opponents and if you are not careful you can target the wrong one.  I have targeted NPCs who made quick work of me, but since this is a discussion of PK, I will stay away from those tales.  The instance that is relevant here is when I was in a group of adventurers and we surrounded a bear and began to swing away.  I target, then attack.  Problem is that I targeted a teammate by accident.  I cast my spell and the spell effect occurs then nothing.  At his end it says "Archanalia casts a spell" followed by "You are protected from the spell".  Excellent.  During a real fight I wouldn't have accidentally targeted a friend, so this helps with game consistency.
<br><br>
"Does this exclude helpful spells," you ask.  No, it does not.  Here's the difference.  Both of these instances have happened.
<br><br>
I am running through a busy area loaded with opponents.  A wizard has climbed to a relatively safe area and as I run through the fray, trying to just pass safely, he casts a spell that is intended to freeze me in place on that spot.  The spell fails!  And as long as I have the PK Switch then it will continue to fail.
<br><br>
Next instance I am in a forest and I am fighting a skeleton.  Not a problem, I was ready for this guy and I do a number on him.  But within seconds of finishing him off there is another there!  So I start fighting this guy except I'm greatly weakened.  I think I can get him, but it will be close.  Out of the forest comes a figure in robes.  He asks if I need help, and I tell him this will be close.  He casts a healing spell on me while I fight, and I am feeling better.  Then he casts another spell and I am attacking faster and more accurately.  I slay the skeleton and thank the figure.  The spells that help players will affect anyone.  There's no "downside" to being healed or enhanced by someone.
<br><br>
Naturally NPCs can hurt you by any means they chose, but players can not run about causing malice with the ease they used to.
<br><br>
So what about area effect spells?  If the team members are all Non-PK and they are mixed in with a bunch of monsters and you cast your spell over the area, which are affected?  An attack spell will hurt only the opponents and YOU.  Yes, you can hurt yourself with an offensive spell (Though you can't hit yourself with a sword…you'll have to suicide by other means).  Does this harm realism?  To a lesser degree, yes.  It hasn't been a major drawback so far that I've seen, as I don't cast many area effect spells unless I'm attacking a group in a distance (i.e. a camp full of bad guys), because if I attacked the bunch of foes that came up to us close, I'd likely hurt myself in the area of effect.  So essentially self-preservation has prevented this from being of major harm.
<br><br>
So are we totally safe?  We are safe from the most common forms of harm brought about by players.  They must be more creative now.  There are some players who lead higher level creatures into areas that are generally considered "newbie" areas.  This puts malicious characters at great risk, because it exposes their back to attack throughout the trip across the area (Trying to out run a griffon could easily prove fatal)  I've not seen anyone do this in a manner that I thought was intentional, though it's happened many times that someone flees by me while pulling a train of monsters along.  The monsters (depending on their programming) tend to stay with the person they are chasing.  If I attack one sometimes they'll break off and sometimes they'll continue chasing. The trains in open spaces, like the East Commons Express are generally escapable for anyone in the path.  However, you could be in quite a little bit of trouble if you get caught in a narrow passage when the conductor runs past you.  You're better off following him to the safety.  Many of the creatures I've encountered in this manner will continue following the "conductor".   It's when they come back that you are often fair game to them.
<br><br>
What I think that the PK switch has brought to the game is something great: It has fostered a sense of community.  Often you will see higher level strangers casting protective wards on beginning characters as they pass by, thus delaying natural selection a bit.  When you are a newbie a protection can be very important in a fight.
<br><br>
The switch has not eliminated power gamers (as well it shouldn't!) and it has not eliminated the important character interaction portion of the game.  It has served to allow people a chance to prosper based solely on their wits and the character's abilities.  My only fear about the switch was that it would destroy spontaneous bar fights or even a chance encounter between a party of dark elves and a party of humans.  Fighting intelligent opponents is the stuff of epic fantasy, and it's good to see that it has been properly preserved.
