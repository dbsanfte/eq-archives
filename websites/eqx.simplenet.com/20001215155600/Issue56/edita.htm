Well, it's been an interesting week.  There have been a few newsworthy items that I want to mention.  The UO lawsuit was settled.  The plaintiffs are dropping their case against EA. As part of that settlement, EA will donate $15,000 to the <a herf="http://www.thetech.org/">San Jose Tech Museum</a>.  You know what, I no longer care whether or not the lawsuit was a good thing.  And heck, with a result like this, I doubt that it will have much impact on EA, much less on the entire industry.
<br><br>
And there has been an announcement about the release of EverQuest and the start of beta phase 4.  Beta 4 should be starting in the first half of February.  That date has not been nailed down yet.  E-mails should be sent to those that have been accepted into the 4th phase of the beta in a week or so.  And the game is slated to be released on March 16th.
<br><br>
I have to say that I am impatient to see some of you in the game…
<br><br>
I've been thinking about what I have been doing in the beta up until now.  It occurred to me that I feel like I have been holding back a bit.  There is a lot of stuff to see and do in this game.  I'm willing to bet that most of the folks that have been testing for as long as I have have seen most of these things.  I have not.  I've found myself starting new characters just about any time that the one I am playing reaches about tenth level.  Sure, I'm not a power gamer, and I don't worry too much about leveling a character.  Plenty of great testers have advanced to test the upper level areas and spells.  And the newbie zones and low level class balancing is probably the most important thing for us to test.  But damn, that leaves a lot of the world beyond my range.
<br><br>
Don't get me wrong, I've explored.  The first thing that I did with Denred when he reached second level was attempt to run from Qeynos to Freeport at the urging of a friend.  We got separated and I saw a lot more of the plains of Karana that I had intended.  Let me warn you now, if you try this and get killed, don't even bother looking for your corpse…  I poked the rather large nose of Mundas into Unrest when he was only 7th level…  I've seen stuff.  But I've not really experienced it.  And I've only just recently noticed that I was doing this.  Why am I holding myself back?  I wonder if there was some hidden psychological reason behind that incident with the Freeport guards (testing a faction bug) that cost my 7th level enchanter a couple levels…
<br><br>
Imagine being one of the EverQuest guides.  These fine folks can go anywhere.  And their duties certainly require that they do so.  I highly doubt that there is any place in Norrath that Ozymandius has not gazed upon.  Why the heck am I not one of those folks?  Let's suppose that I would make an acceptable guide (I can dream, can't I?).  Why would I not want to be one and see all of Norrath?
<br><br>
Only recently in the beta have I begun to hang out with the folks from EQX.  For the most part we all went our own ways, each having some area that they wanted to test.  But we recently decided to play together (and this really feels like 'playing' and not 'testing').  It started when someone came up with the idea that we should all play inkies again.  We tried this once a while ago, and it fell through mostly due to scheduling troubles.  But this time we actually did it.  We started characters and played around in the newbie areas of Neriak (yes, played.)  We had a blast!  We have come to evolve this little group into a guild, one that we will use to help test the guild features and to do some interesting things here on EQX, but that's for a later discussion.
<br><br>
Then a few weeks ago my phone line got all fuzzy  (and still is now, the phone company should be working on it any day now) and I couldn't stay connected.  I REALLY missed EverQuest.  In the past I treated these things like a break.  Sure, testing is fun, but it can be a real pain at times too.  But when separated from the gang, I felt uneasy.   And just this week, when my phone line started to act up again, I realized that I had been holding back from the real meat of the game, from really letting myself play.  I was holding back because I wanted the game to be fresh for me when I would be able to explore it with some of my on-line friends.  I realized that all the preaching that I have been doing about not reading spoiler sites was not just a bunch of crap.  Not only did I mean that for others that want to play the game, but I meant it for myself too.  And I was sort of enforcing this on myself on a subconscious level.
<br><br>
I only came to fully realize this when I heard the announcement for the start of phase 4.  Let's face facts, when phase 4 starts in February the game will be one month to six weeks from release.  EverQuest should be a fairly complete project by the time phase 4 starts.  Sure, there will be things to fix right up until the last minute, but the real bulk of the testing should be done by then.  And I think that I have been looking forward to a chance to explore Norrath with the friends that I have made in this community.  Phase 4 is when they'll all be in Norrath, and the bulk of my duties as a tester will be complete.  I guess I didn't want to be one of those old smart-ass know-it-alls that is bored waiting for the rest to catch up.  Or worse, one of those idiots that likes to tell you the ending of a book while you're still on chapter 3.  I want to be just as excited as the rest of you are when we first see a Frost Giant (sorry, I've seen too many Griffins by now  :p ).
<br><br>
I am very much looking forward to phase 4.  I feel confident that the testers and 989 Studios have done their work very well.  I'm even pretty sure that I did a good job as a tester.  But some time soon I want to PLAY this game.  I want to take my time exploring Norrath with a bunch of you that can show it to me with fresh eyes (which, by the way, is one of the great things that every new phase of testers brings to this).  Maybe a year from now I'll be ready to beg Ozy to let me into the Guide program (I have immense respect for them, giving up their play time to work as guides).  But until then, I want to be a player.
<br><br>
You know what, this might also explain why I'm such a slow reader.  The better the book, the slower I read…
