Come listen to a story 'bout a bar-shin' troll,<br>
From the swamp and to the city,<br>
Barshin' away at all the gnolls,<br>
One day he was afightin' and alookin' for some food,<br>
And out from the shadows came a dark elven dude.<br>
(Necromancer that is.  Lean mean undead summoning machine.)

Tiger's Heart<font size="-2">*</font> was tired.  She had been tired enough her entire life.  However, at the end of this day she was tired enough for two of her own lifetimes.  But she had not gained her honorific by quitting when she was tired.  She pushed on still further into the night.  The others had died because they couldn't keep running.  She would join them some day, but not until she was unable to run one step further.  The snakes always grew tired quickly.  It was her endurance that kept her alive.  And her stubborn unwillingness to die.

A plain with two walls, two walls that are closing on one another with each passing second. Magic? No, look closer. You can see the bricks of the walls, however, they are not made of stone. Each stone is alive, different from the next but still moving perfectly in time with the rest. The bricks are strong, do not be fooled by their size my friend, they are strong. Yet, one brick does not a wall make. This wall is many times stronger than the sum of its parts. Why you ask? Because the bricks are men, men from every corner of Norrath. Alone they are merely a scattering of rocks, but together my friend, together they make the Gods tremble.

<em>"Killed by Dwarves and chased by Gnomes in this fair land that I call home.

Sadly they see no wrong in this as they break my teeth with their angry 
fists.
<br><br>
I run and dodge to no avail, to have my head smashed open with iron flails.

If only they could see across the blue. They'd find a Teir'Dal army... but 
they have no clue.
<br><br>
Its time for me to go, away I fly. Knowing that one day, they'll all die."</em>

Unlike Oghma, I haven't been playing much at all these last few weeks.  Primarily due to the holidays and the wonderful illness that I caught that allowed me to spend the last week at home in bed.  But I should have known better.  After all, I had the week off.  I'm always sick on vacation days.

Well, I've gone and lost everything on my hard drive, and some of the things were unfinished stories that were started months ago, and I guess will never be finished.  One of the things it did do was to force me to get a new hard drive, and this on is faster and nicer and my load times are much faster.  But enough about my troubles - Happy New Year!

Yep your right. I would gladly give up the *chance* to get things if there were lots of differnt things. What I mean is... 1 person per server should have a rare item, say those thulian bladed claws. Now that person keeps them till he gives them to someone or sells them.
