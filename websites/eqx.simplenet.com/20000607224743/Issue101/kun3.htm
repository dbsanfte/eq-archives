Do any of you remember back in beta, when we got a few exclusive screenshots to play around with?  We thought it was a fun idea to write up stories based on those screen shots.  And it was!  Take a look at what came of it <em>(You'll have to use your back button to get back here)</em>:
<br><br>
<a href="../Issue17/shotstory.htm">From Issue 17</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="../Issue43/iss43.htm">From Issue 43 - <em>all in the left column</em></a>
<br><br>
And now we find ourselves with four shots from Kunark.  We put up one last issue, and we've got a new one for you this issue.  So how about it?  Can you write stories based on these screen shots?  I KNOW there are some great authors out there.  Let's see what you can do.  Write something about either or both of these screen shots, and if it's good, we'll feature it next issue along with whatever the staff comes up with.  But get them to me (at this <a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">e-mail address</a>) by Thursday the 25th of November so that we can get them into the next issue.

Here is the newest screenshot, with the last one below it.
