<p align="justify">Welcome to Issue 4.  It's me again, <a href="mailto:alanvc@concentric.net">Absor</a>.  
Thanks again to all the EQX staff and contributers.  Great work folks. 
<br>
<br>
Last time I got to do an editorial, I ranted a bit.  This time I want to discuss an issue that came up recently.<br><br>
I was talking with a few of the folks that I have come to respect since I started poking around EverQuest.  
I was surprised to find that we shared a common fear.  A fear that EverQuest might not be all that we want it to be.  
We had a few different concerns.  But they all seemed to relate to one thing.  That the switch might not be the 
answer to the random player killer problem.  In fact, it might make things worse.  We shared a concern that perhaps 
the developers of EverQuest might be relying too heavily on the switch to solve the player killing issues.  
So the first thing I wanted to say is addressed to those developers.  Please do not forget those of us that want to 
have player interaction with the switch on.  We need the switch and as many of the other random killer deterents as 
you can think of, including but not limited to: city guards (not uberguards), notoriety and alignment (if done correctly this 
is a fantastic idea), wanted posters, etc.  I am certain that you have heard more suggestions than I.<br><br>
But there is more to it than that.  Even if EverQuest has the perfect coding, it may still have imperfect players.  
I want to encourage you all to keep in mind that this is a ROLEPLAYING game.  So encourage players to roleplay.  
Stay in character.  Teach others how much fun it can be to immerse yourself in the life of your character, especially if the 
character is complex and interesting.  Those of you that have a lot of roleplaying experience can easily teach those that don't.  
I have found that all roleplayers are natural teachers.  It must be more so for those that are also computer literate.  
So please, teach by example.<br><br>
Well, please enjoy this issue of EQX!
