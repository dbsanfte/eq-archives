	A soft breeze whispered on the windowsill, shadows dancing as short, fat candles sputtered merrily in the moonlight.   The fresh rain-tinged breath mingled exquisitely with the candle's light bayberry,  and Lyza Albright smiled as she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply.  Seated cross-legged and straight-backed in the center of the small room, her breathing slowed as she began the descent into her own mind.  It wasn't often she received an entire evening for meditation, as her duties for mistress Euphoria commonly filled her days from sunrise to set.  In the glow of moonbeam and candle light, Lyza offered a prayer to Rodcet Nife and reflected upon the day's events.
<br><br>
	As with most mornings, hers had begun well before the sun had kissed the morning horizon.  By the time the black overcast sky of night had turned to misty grey of dawn, the hearths had been fired and the breakfast loaves were well on their way to completion.    Looking after six women, ten horses, three old milk cows and a cat was no small task , but by the time all of the human residents of the cottage had risen, fresh cream, hot loaves of honeybread and several selections of choice berries had awaited to break their fast.  Continuing her rounds, she had stopped by each girl's room, blessing each of their blades with a short prayer before continuing about her chores.  She did this from time to time for mistress Euphoria, usually by request before an expedition into the hills.   One never knew what waited over the horizon.  
<br><br>
	Shortly after midday, mistress Euphoria had informed them all that they had the rest of the day to do with as they pleased, as she and young mistress Jez'al had tasks to be about. The rest of the girls had taken the rare opportunity of a free day to visit Freeport itself, where they would most likely be until the wee hours of the morn.  Lyza herself had chosen to stay at the cottage in order to continue her ongoing research of the various scrolls and books mistress Euphoria and her students brought back from time to time.  Her research had taken until nightfall, which is when the rain had started.  It was all Lyza could do to keep her concentration as her mind drifted to the new batch of scrolls the girls had brought back from Ak'Anon. These new scrolls contained information regarding an ongoing project her and mistress Euphoria had been researching for some time, information concerning the fabled Tomb of the Seven Moons.   If these scrolls were what they appeared to be, Lyza suspected her future may hold a fair bit of traveling.  
<br><br>
	A noise in the night outside of her window brought her mind back to the present.  She ceased her reflections and listened.  Nothing now, yet she had heard something.  She got to her feet and walked to the window, cocking her head as she listened to the night wind.  
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The night upon which the wind blew was not being kind.  Jez'al swore to herself she had never run so far in her life, yet she had run the distance from Freeport to the cottage everyday for years.   Tonight the miles seemed to stretch on and on.  Every step somehow managed to find a tangling root or fallen branch in it's way, forcing her to keep to a light trot instead of the full out sprint she felt her legs demanding.  Already her fine silk shirtsleeves were in tatters, her hands bloodied and her shoulder throbbing with every heartbeat.  <em>It would serve me right if I fell and broke my damned fool neck</em>, she thought through the haze of <em>run, run, run, run, run</em> that echoed with Euphoria's voice in her head.  She shouldn't have left the old woman alone, but she knew she had had no choice in the matter.  She knew now that if she had stayed, she would be dead.  She had faced a Liche Lord in the streets of Freeport and lived, a fact she now silently thanked Lyza for, but the enchantment on her dagger had most likely dissipated by now.  Jez'al hoped Lyza had done the same for Euphoria.  
<br><br>
	As Jez'al ran, she finally found what she had been seeking.  The Sleeping Elephant they called it, a huge rock that jutted out of the forest's hilly floor.  It was a landmark that meant she was nearly to the cottage, and a sight she praised the gods for.  Her run was now barely a walk and her lungs burned with the effort. The pain in her shoulder from the dwarf assassin's throwing blade was on fire.  And it wasn't just her shoulder now, but her entire arm.  <em>Poisoned then</em>, she mused bitterly.  It did not occur to her that the shoulder tormenting her with each throb was not the shoulder that had been hit by the dwarf's blade.  She stopped for a moment, doubled over to catch a brief breath and started forward again.  Jez'al fell with her first step.  She called Lyza's name as loudly as she could, hoping her friend would hear, and struggled back to her feet.  She took three steps before her legs gave out and she collapsed in a painful pile of exhaustion.  The poison coursed with her racing heart, and with a rising terror she realized that her eyes were wide open, yet they saw nothing but darkness.    She managed one last attempt at a scream before she lost consciousness on the forest floor.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	This time, Lyza recognized the scream as her name.  One of the girls must have run into trouble on the return from Freeport.  Lyza ran out of her meditation chamber and down the stone stairs, taking two at a time.  Charging down the short hallway she paused as she reached the front door, grabbing the large redwood club that hung there.  She may dedicate her days to cooking and housekeeping, but she was also a cleric of the First Order of Rodcet Nife, and had by no means gone soft in her mundane duties.  She flung the double doors open and raced barefoot into the forest toward the Sleeping Elephant, nightrobes flowing out behind her like phantoms in the moonlight.
<br><br>
	Within minutes she had reached her destination.  Lightly panting, she paused to examine her surroundings as she caught her breath.  <em>Leave the light blasted running to mistress Euphoria and the girls</em>, she cursed.  <em>I was meant to stand toe to toe with evil, not chase it around the countryside</em>.  A feeble moan to her right brought her large frame around in a snap, club at the ready.  She saw nothing but trees.  Lyza closed her eyes for a brief moment and made an intricate gesture with her free hand.  A small glowing ball appeared above her upturned palm, pushing the night back and creating a small pool of light around her.  Lyza suppressed a startled cry as she noticed a shape she had mistaken for a rock was indeed not.  Not unless rocks wore clothes and bled.  Lyza dropped her club and knelt by the still form on the ground.  It was Jez'al, and she looked to be in a bad way.  The bandages the young girl had on her shoulder were soaked through with blood, and her breathing was hardly noticeable.  Lyza put her hand on the girls brow, and sucked in a breath as she felt the heat emanating from it.  The cleric closed her eyes again and muttered, and as she did a light green glow pulsed slowly from Lyza's outstretched hand  to Jez'al.  The light disappeared quickly, much to Lyza's relief.  It hadn't been a strong poison, likely just exhaustion, if the girl had run this whole way bleeding as she was.  Euphoria's housekeeper extinguished her light and grunted as she hefted Jez'al's limp form over her shoulder.  Any further injuries would have to wait.  Grabbing her club, she turned and trudged back toward the cottage.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
	<p style="text-align: justify">
	It was Ozat's office, and the rain was falling.  Somewhere in the city a bell tolled the midnight hour.  She felt strange, and struggled to discern why.  Her shoulder no longer hurt, that was something, and things looked.... hazy, sounds came to her distorted and echoing.  It seemed like she was underwater, yet..... thought slipped away as soon as she tried to grasp it.  When she looked around again, it was not Ozat's office, but the street outside of the Rusty Gull tavern.  Jez'al finally managed a coherent thought, and as she did, things seemed to solidify around her.  A dream then, of course.  But not a normal dream, the kind that ended or changed as soon as you realized what it was.  No, this all seemed very real somehow.  
<br><br>
	The door to the dockside tavern opened with a bang, spilling light out onto the dark street and causing Jez'al to give a startled yelp of surprise.  She did get a surprise then, as she reached for her dagger only to find that she had no hands.  And no body it seemed as well as she looked down and saw cobblestone instead of feet.  A drunken patron stumbled out into the street, confirming her non-existence as he stumbled right through the space Jez'al was standing.  The intoxicated sailor whirled around with a confused look in his eyes, and seeing nothing, threw the sign of the evil eye into the air before staggering off as quickly as he could.  Curiouser and curiouser.  Two more people stumbled out the door, a man and a woman arm in arm and drunkenly singing a bawdy tune.  Jez'al thought she recognized the female, but couldn't say how.  On second thought, she couldn't seem to remember <em>anything</em> clearly.  Some sort of meeting and a sense of danger following, but nothing else.  Her mind was alone in this small island of coherence.  She decided to follow the drunk couple as they meandered into the night.  
<br><br>
	The couple finished their song and the girl laughed as she almost fell and her companion caught her.  Of course, the girl was Maryn Bell, one of Jez'al's fellow students under Euphoria.  Lyza had given them all the night off, how could she have forgotten?  It seemed Maryn had decided the long months at the cottage had been a bit lonely, and was about to remedy that.  She always had been a flirtatious little thing.  Jez'al, still unsure about her non-existent form, let the couple gain some distance on her.  She followed them that way until they reached a narrow street, two story apartments on each side.  Their destination she gathered, as the man opened a door and pulled Maryn inside.  Deciding privacy was now the best course of action, Jez'al was turning to leave when she heard a man scream from inside.   Jez'al rushed to the door and then paused, not knowing exactly what she could do.  Her thought was interrupted as the door splintered off of it's hinges and swung broken into the street.  Maryn's companion staggered out with an odd look, before falling onto his face in the street.  A large dirk protruded from his back and a dark pool began seeping out from underneath him.  Jez'al rushed forward into dark apartment ready for an attack, forgetting she wasn't really there.  
<br><br>
	She shook her head as here eyes adjusted much too quickly to the dark apartment.  At her feet a halfling lay unmoving with his head twisted at an odd angle.  In the middle of the room, the larger form of Maryn danced and skitted between three smaller figures.  Jez'al thought the three little halflings looked somewhat familiar.  Maryn had changed the odds from four on one to three on one, but she was in trouble still.  Maryn was fast, but in her intoxicated state she was no match for the agile, sober halflings.  They were wearing her down, darting in and out with their small daggers, avoiding Maryn's blows which were becoming slower and wilder.  Maryn bled out of more than a dozen gashes all over her lower body and the stone floor was darkening with blood.  Jez'al frantically swung her non-hands at one of the halflings, and felt tears coming to her non-eyes as she helplessly watched her comrade die.  Maryn fell to her knees in a pool of blood, and gave up the fight.  Just as all three halflings pounced, the entire room blurred and Jez'al was once again outside the Rusty Gull.
<br><br>
	It seemed time was as non-existent as her body was.  The three halfling ruffians were rounding the corner just as Jez'al started a rush back to the dark apartment, at least a ten minute walk.  She stopped and watched as they entered the tavern, and followed them in seconds later.  Two of them sauntered to the bar, ordering two ales in celebration of a job well done.  The third walked to a small table in the corner of the tavern, where he was greeted by a long haired elf.  Again Jez'al seemed to recognize the face, and again could not place it.  She drifted closer to hear the palaver.
<br><br>
	"Done?" the elf asked quietly.
<br><br>
	"Aye, quite 'o bit of sport she was.  A feisty little gilly, but a dead little gilly," the halfling croaked a laugh at his joke.
<br><br>
	"Where is Domi?  No, don't tell me, I always told him he'd get himself dead if wasn't careful.  No matter though, just means more of this for us!", the elf exclaimed as he tossed a small purse at the halfling.
<br><br>
	The little figure cackled as he shook the bag, and Jez'al recognized the jingle of platinum.  
<br><br>
	The halfling grew serious for a moment, dropping his voice as he spoke.  "And what 'o that old pussbag Euphoria?  That wrinkled old gilly'll chew us all up 'n spit us out quick as a pixie," he emphasized his point by spitting on the floor.
<br><br>
	The elf grinned slyly.  "Oh, don't worry your furry little toes about <em>that</em> one.  Our employer has a few 'friends' that will take care of that old biddy.  I have been assured that our friend Euphoria has seen her last sunrise.  May she rot in pieces."  He followed suit and spit on the floor.  "I shouldn't have begged off as I did and just finished her and her little fishsucking friend tonight.  But she had the drop on me, blast it.  What do we have left, you finished all of her little whores tonight didn't you?" he inquired.
<br><br>
	The halfling wheezed a laugh.  "Oh, aye!  They all squealed like gnoll-pups!  'Ere we were, plottin' how to get 'em, and they all come strollin their fancy arses into town like it's fair day!  All we gots left is that fat do-gooder what cleans their house and the one what killed poor Balor earlier.  He got one 'o his dirty blades into her though, that he did! Har!" he giggled again.
<br><br>
	"Excellent! Things unfold faster than I anticipated, which means more time to drink!  Wench! Ale!"  the elf yelled out with a laugh.
<br><br>
	Jez'al felt sick.  All of her friends.  Maryn. Elsa. Wynn.  Jayen.  All dead, how could that be?  Who wanted them dead?  That was a silly question; Jez'al supposed about half the population of Freeport wanted them dead.  <em>A pirate's life for me, arr!</em> the old silly saying drifted into her head.  She must warn Lyza! But... yes, that's what she had been trying to do.  Warn Lyza about.... something.  Grey robes.  The Liche.  Euphoria! What was happening to her?  <em>Think Jez think! hold your thoughts together girl!</em> But already the world was spinning and the walls blurring.  The door she had come in was now a front door she recognized.  It was the cottage she had called home for ten years, and she was outside.  The moon had jumped again, and Jez'al wondered how many hours had passed.  <em>I have to wake up! How do I wake myself up!</em> She gazed out into the forest and wondered where here body lay.  She had been running.  Maybe she was dead.  <em>Maybe this is the afterlife</em>, her mind whispered.  
<br><br>
	As her gaze swept through the trees, her non-stomach dropped into a ball of ice as she saw for a second time that night shadows give way to a grey robed figure.  It was no more than fifteen feet distant, and she could feel it's gaze upon her.  She was frozen.  She willed herself to move, but nothing happened.  The Liche was coming toward her.  She shouldn't be scared, the physical world couldn't affect her as she had already witnessed.  But she didn't think Liches dwelt solely in the physical world; she could <em>fee</em>l the undead gaze as surely as if it were icy daggers on her skin.  She had to do something, anything.  Jez'al turned and drifted <em>through</em> the front doors.   
<br><br>
	The cottage itself was what they all called their estate, but in actuality was a small wooden manor.  Just large enough to house it's eight residents, the cottage sat nestled square and stout amongst the trees in the low rolling hills outside of Freeport.  Two stories in height, the four outer walls were covered with a lush creepvine that almost made the building look as if it were part of the hills that held it.  These four outer walls held the manor's main rooms, and enclosed a large square courtyard, causing the vine covered structure to resemble a small castle or keep.  In the center of this courtyard, surrounded by a small garden, was the study.  The study was a slim stone tower that peeked above the main walls, a long hub in a spokeless square wheel.  The study was just that; the place where Euphoria and her students kept any books or scrolls or artifacts they happened to recover whilst practicing their trade, and doubling as Lyza's small shrine to Rodcet Nife.  It was to the study Jez'al drifted now.  That was where Lyza would be, and that would be where the Shadow Man was bound.  
<br><br>
	The shock of seeing ones own broken body can be quite unsettling, and Jez'al was quite unsettled.  She found Lyza in her shrine, kneeling over something and muttering prayers to her god.  That something was Jez'al herself.  Stretched out naked beneath a pure white sheet, surrounded by hundreds of small white candles, her body lay in the middle of the small shrine.  But shock could wait, <em>must</em> wait; she must warn the old cleric, must tell her somehow.  Regaining what wits she could, Jez'al remembered the way the drunken sailor had reacted when he had walked through her.  Drifting to the kneeling cleric, she placed her non-hands on Lyza's head.  They passed right through, as she had expected, but drew no reaction.  <em>Oh gods.  Lyza! Lyza get up! Get up!  You must run! Lyza! The Liche! A Liche! A Liche!</em>  Jez'al screamed with her mind as she desperately flailed at the older woman.  Her cries began to turn to sobs as she realized the woman couldn't hear her.  But what was that? Had Lyza said something?  No, no, it hadn't come from Lyza, it had come from her own inanimate body.  She screamed with her mind again.  
<br><br>
	"<em>Mord'an... mord'an....</em>"  Barely a whisper from the lips of her mortal shell.  But enough.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Lyza bound to her feet and swept her keen gaze around the room.
<br><br>
	"Jez, child?  Are you here?" she asked anxiously.  "I thought I'd lost you!  <em>Mord'an</em>. That explains it.  You've been spelled by a Shadow Man!  Jez'al!  If you can hear me, I need you to do exactly what I tell you!  I can only do this once, so listen carefully.  I need you to concentrate.  Focus all of your will upon this body.  Think of nothing else!  Only becoming one with this body!" Lyza ordered this all into thin air and paused for a moment, awaiting a response she knew she would not hear.  The girl had to be here, incredible as it may be.  She had tried every cleansing spell she knew, and yet still the young girl's body remained still.  <em>Mord'an</em>.  Lyza was sure she had heard it.  Which meant the full course of the Liche's corrupting touch had not been run.  She had seen it before, and spoken to the only survivor of such a dastardly spell.  The body died quickly while the mind and spirit roamed free.  A very educational experience, until the body died.  That is when the spirit suffers a fate worse than death, and a spectre is born.  If she acted quickly, her young ward would not suffer this blasphemy.  
<br><br>
	Lyza closed her eyes and tried to clear her mind.  This was not an easy task as her heart thundered beneath her breast and adrenaline surged her veins.  This was what she had dedicated her life to.  This sole purpose.  The preservation of life in the face of the darkness of the undead.  She offered a prayer to the Prime Healer with all of her heart.
<br><br>
	"O Healer, sacred preserver of life.  Hear me now and heed my call!  One who has given herself entirely unto your vital radiance, my life gladly for those who would need it!  Revoke this blasphemy on all that walks under Your Light!  Reclaim that which has been tainted by darkness! Rejoin spirit and body, make them whole in your image as they rightly should be!  Hear me O beloved one!"  Lyza stretched her hands over the broken body before her and continued her prayer in silence, fingers weaving intricate patterns into the air.  A glow seemed to emanate from the very stone beneath her feet, and the walls began to sing with resonance.  He appeared before her, a brilliant blaze of white that made new fallen snow look like coal.  It washed over her body in a warm flush that spoke of spring and sun and wind and water.  The essence of life itself.  And then it faded slowly away, and she was again amidst flickering candles and soft incense.  Never in her life would Lyza Albright again see a brilliance such as Rodcet Nife in all His glory.
<br><br>
	Lyza stood for a moment, swayed, and collapsed to knees that had no strength to hold her up.  She reached out a trembling hand and grabbed the cold fingers that lay before her.  She thought she felt them give a gentle squeeze before all she knew was darkness.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The moon hung lazily in the northern sky, and the stars twinkled in cold fury.  The remaining rain drops tried to relive their heavenly descent, silently cascading one by one from shingled rooftop before gathering themselves in so many muddy puddles.  Somewhere in the night wind, a lone shutter offered a one handed applause, the only spectator as unnatural shadow deepened and crept into the courtyard of the cottage.
