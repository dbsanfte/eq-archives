I always stayed close to the harbor to see if any familiar mariner’s, in from long
trips, were ashore.  I would often dream of voyaging to far off lands, fighting sea
monsters, and hunting treasure in dungeons, rich with treasure.  I observed one of
the seamen hauling a trunk on his shoulders as he paraded up the plank of a huge
freighter.  The man stood at least six and a half-foot tall. His shoulders measured
as wide as I was tall, his hand the size of a cantaloupe.  Veins the size of a tree
branch bulged out on his muscular arms displaying years of hard labor.

"How goes my little pirate?" Balin chuckled and waved with his free hand.  With a
shrug of his massive shoulder, Balin tossed the two hundred-pound oak chest to the
ground like it was made of balsa.    "No time for stories today lad, I’m way behind
schedule!" he barked.
