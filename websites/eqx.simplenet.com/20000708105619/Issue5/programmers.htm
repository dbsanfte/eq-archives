<big><big>A</big></big> few weeks ago (yes I am one of the last people on EARTH to find out), I discovered the wonder that is EverQuest. I spent almost eight hours browsing web pages to see and read everything I could about this game. Finally, I downloaded the movie and I was hooked. So I went to sleep and dreamed of Dragons and Dark Elves (but that may have been the pickles and chocolate). The next day, however, I awoke with a bad feeling in my gut (that also could have been the. . . nah too predictable). Anyway, I started thinking.
<br><br><em> What if I'm all exited for nothing?
<br><br> What if the game looks great, but runs worse than the second Laura Bow adventure?
<br><br> WHAT IF THE PROGRAMMERS DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GAME!?!?!?</em>
<br><br>You have to understand that I have been playing an online game for about a year in which the programmers show up maybe once a month and all they do is fart around with monsters and adamantly REFUSE to listen to ANYHTING the players say. In the interest of journalism, I'll refrain from naming this game. Lets just say it starts with "M", ends with "59" and has "eridian" in the middle. So I had some concerns that my hopes for EQ would only be shattered in the open beta.

Then I found it.
<br><br>
[Valderen] Brad and Bill: Do you actually intend to play the game?<br>
[Aradune] val: the biggest reason i am making this game, and there are many of course, is to PLAY IT!
<br><br>
When going through the monthly chat logs with the EverQuest programmers, I came upon this quote. I actually felt my knees go weak and my eyes tear up. There are many things that I believe will make EQ the best online game yet, but for me, this was the clincher.
<br><br>With a game this complex, I believe it is close to impossible that it will ship with no flaws or bugs. However, unlike some other online games out there, these flaws should actually be fixed in a reasonable amount of time.

I'm a computer science major and so I tend to look at the programming side of games with quite a bit of scrutiny. The world of online gaming opens up whole new opportunities as well as challenges for the programmers. I mean, obviously you cannot just code the game, debug, and ship. For this kind of work, it is absolutely necessary for the programmers to be deeply in love with their creation. I also admire the fact that after spending hour after tedious hour, Brad and Bill are still exited as ever to get online with hundreds of others and experience the game in full.
<br><br>I don't mean this to sound like a love letter to the EQ design team, but I don't think that there is anything as vital to the game as programmers with a vision. So remember ye fans of EverQuest, when you begin to come up with elaborate suggestions for the game, and those of you who begin to doubt that EQ will surpass any other game out there, you are really asking yourselves whether the men behind the magic are competent and willing to make the game great. I've heard some ideas that make me cringe with the complexity of them, but if the good people at Sony keep their interest in the game, eventually we will all be so addicted to the game that our families will leave us and we won't stop until the good people at Computer City come to repossess our computers (we lost our jobs long ago <img src="../eqxpics/smiley.gif" border="0"> ).
