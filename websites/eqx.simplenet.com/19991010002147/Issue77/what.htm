<p style="text-align: justify">


<p style="text-align: justify">We’ve all been told for the past several years that online gaming is the future of gaming.  We are gradually seeing game enhancements being added due to technological improvements, such as 3-D worlds, and gaming with voice.  As more programs are written with these newer improvements (such as the PIII chips and 3d accelerator innovations) and the bandwidth problems get addressed, we will see further enhancements to the games themselves.  Highly detailed worlds, more sophisticated AI, and more complex interactivity will make games more and more &quot;real&quot;.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Most of us think of games as something we buy off the shelf and play, complete as a package.  We all know that a bug-free game is almost impossible to achieve, with all the different hardware and video standards, sound cards, and CPU types requiring different ways to address what a game wishes to accomplish. The millions of lines of code required are humanly impossible to make without some error. Online games, because of network difficulties and the challenges of connectivity, are probably more buggy than stand-alone games.  One thing that I have always found interesting is Brad McQuaid’s assertion that EverQuest is a not only a game, but a service.  What does this really mean?</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Most gaming companies (indeed most software companies) make patches available online to address bugs as they are discovered.  EverQuest, as many other online games, had an extensive beta-testing phase to uncover bugs, and while many were discovered, as they went live to the public more were discovered.  So, rather than fumbling around and denying that the game is buggy and requires patches (Hello, Mr. Gates!), maybe that statement is an admission that, well, this game isn’t done.  You have just bought an unfinished product.  </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Companies address this unfinished-ness in a variety of ways.  Patching is a perfect solution for online games, since, well, you are online and have easy access to the rapid acquisition of software changes. Patching seems more necessary with games with persistent worlds, like Ultima Online and EverQuest.  While daily patching would seem excessive, certainly I can see semi-weekly patching being a norm though if a game is that buggy, it probably has some serious flaws. Asheron's Call is going for a more dynamic world with their plan to load their zones and dungeons off the server on the fly, so they can change the world without patches.  Currently beta-testers are (infrequently) patching while they play, which has a negative impact on game-play.  I’m not sure if the effort will be worth it, because it may become an expectation now. We will have to patch, we are used to it, and not patching will not be that large a selling point.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Expansion packs are another way for a company to address fixes needed in the game.  Most gamers will buy expansion packs if they think the original product is good enough to warrant further investment.  Online games are interesting because they are a continuing investment, with a monthly fee.  The longer you play, the more you invest in it.  The impetus for expansion packs may be more intense.  The EQ expansion pack will add to the game, without requiring its purchase if you wish to continue playing, which I hope, works out as planned.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Why would you buy an unfinished product?  Most of us have bought games in the past year or so, and they were surely buggy in some way.  Perhaps we buy it because we’ve been told that it’s finished, or we assume that it is because it comes in a box in a store, but really, any software product is unfinished.  We just perhaps notice it more with games with persistent worlds that have been heavily hyped <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
.  Maybe we are not buying games anymore, we are buying services.  With this &quot;service&quot; comes new expectations, and new frustrations.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">We should now expect patching, and downtime, and server crashes, as part of the experience.  We should also expect continual, ongoing work on bugs and game fixes.  We should expect further development of the game world, and the bug fixes that come with that development.  We should expect story lines to evolve, and change.  We should expect frequent updates as to what has changed in the game, what is going to change, and what will not change.  We should expect that the feedback we provide in the game be addressed with the game’s best future in mind.  Rants about how one class has something another doesn’t should be looked at judiciously and the truth dissected from the &quot;grass is greener&quot; pouting.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">We also should expect that the game is, really, much more finished than not.  Patching should never be a method of finishing a product too quickly released (Unreal and Blood 2 come to mind).  Patching should be bug fixes, not a way to introduce new problems.  While some feel that EQ was unfinished, I think that there has been ample work from the Verant staff to address some of our other expectations.  It’s just such a huge undertaking, that there were bound to be many problems.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">We should expect to pay continually for a game, most likely in the form of monthly fees. I am aware that fixing bugs and tweaking the game requires staff time, effort, and above all, money.  Servers, bandwidth, and their maintenance are expensive also, and monthly fees should offset that.  If the company continues to actively and effectively work on the product, we should be continuing to pay.  Expansion packs should be funded, not by our monthly fees, but by the anticipated income from the sale of that expansion pack.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Another thing that monthly fees should address is support from Sysops/GMs.  As a long-time MUDder, I know that there are plenty of individuals who do GM work for free for a MUD, and EQ’s Guide program is the Verant version of this volunteer work force.  Paid, powered GM’s should be the official voice (as they are) and have the ability to make game-affecting decisions. There should be enough Guides and GM’s available to address game problems in a timely manner.  Community issues are another matter which online games need to address.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">For online RPGs there are a group of individuals (myself included) who have played volunteer based MUDs, who are used to unfinished, broken areas that eventually get worked on. We already accept that there will be difficulties in an online multi-player environment, some with the game itself, some with the community.  We pay for the game to get the graphics and sound effects and to be involved in an ongoing story line. We pay the monthly fees so a full-time GM will address the bugs and enhancements (presumably) quicker, and that the staff will also address the occasional problem with an abusive community member.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Those who come from a stand-alone and console viewpoint haven’t had these experiences, and therefore will have a time of adjustment.  Sometimes the behavior of other players has a negative impact on your gaming experience, and it’s something that can’t be addressed by ANY game system.  Someone stealing your kill isn’t a bug, it’s just bad behavior.  Bad behavior, though should be addressed by the only system available that can: GMs/Guides who take the time to investigate complaints and then have a rapid conclusion to those investigations.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">So, how does Verant score with EQ as a service?  What sort of conclusions can we make about the future of such a service orientation from the example of EverQuest?</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">EverQuest had extensive beta testing in an attempt to address all the bugs and get all the features in the game.  Things that in general, were for higher level characters and could be addressed later were added after release, in addition to a few things that should have been in.  So while we can conclude that EverQuest was essentially shipped unfinished, it was pretty much done, with a large effort by Verant to address bugs in the beta testing.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The network problems with the first couple of weeks were not Verant’s fault, but did illustrate (and painfully so) that some proactive measures could have been made.  Nevertheless, Verant showed outstanding dedication to their customer base with hours upon hours of work to resolve it, and they keep working on making lag and packet loss it a non-issue. </P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Last weeks server crash on Xegony shows another pitfall of games where information is stored and run from a server instead of from a client.  When we play client-based games, we expect that any crash or loss of data is our doing, but when it happens in an online environment, we point the finger to the service provider.  Verant provided restores from backups, but some players lost hours and hours of work.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Verant actively addresses player’s concerns about the game – you need to only read the frequent updates on EQVault and EQSS to see that the camping issue is being looked at and addressed, with extensive player input.  Verant has been very good at listening to players, and their work ethic is astonishing.  I know of Verant programmers giving up hours and hours of their time so you and I could have a good gaming experience.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Guide program is apparently still a work in progress.  As Verant adds servers, the number of Guides must be increased, and finding dedicated individuals with enough game knowledge and a service attitude is difficult.  Keeping a large volunteer workforce up-to-date with changes and their potential impact is an enormously challenging task, but a necessary one for Verant.  Guides must always be aware of new patches and their potential impact, as they are the front-line of customer service.  All the Guides I have dealt with have been personable and helpful, and I especially like those who role-play their characters.  <I>&quot;You’re a dwarf?  I don’t help dwarves, they are a black mark on Faydwer’s soil&quot; </I>(this from a high elf Guide who was very helpful).</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">The promised interactive GM quests have been slow to happen, if at all, and I expect this is because of the amount of Guides needed to run events.  I try to keep an eye out for these interactive quests on the newsgroups and the news sites, but I expect that these types of in-game events will be slow to appear.  The amount of regular quests has been increasing dramatically, however, so I guess I’ll have to revisit some of my old haunts to get more quests until then.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">Boy, there are a lot of shoulds in this article… Should this, should not that.  I would really hate to be in the business of creating an online game <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
.  I think that Verant is doing well, but not perfectly at this time in the game’s evolution.  Verant’s continuing commitment to the game, and the work ethic that goes into it, continually impresses me.  The goodwill with which they approach even the most virulent and nasty message board posters is nothing less than astounding.</P>

<p style="text-align: justify">When it all comes down to it, we are forging into new territory.  While we may squeal about being guinea pigs at times, I hope that if a company actively cares about it’s product and continues to address it’s issues, the online RPG community has a solid, fun future ahead of it.  Some of these issues will ALWAYS be there, despite Verant’s best efforts.  The Internet will always be a factor in our gaming, and things sometimes just happen.   During the beta, a trunk line to Georgia got cut and most of Southern and Central Florida had no Internet service.  I, of course, was frantically calling my ISP, because the last thing I saw was a horde of orcs heading my way in Crushbone.  There will ALWAYS be the specter of server failure – despite regular maintenance and backups, these things happen.  There will ALWAYS be the chance of losing hours, days, even months of work – it’s depressing, but it’s true.  Let’s hope that all the experiences we have in game will make up for the (hopefully) rare misstep.</P>

These services offer online gamers a large number of online games, but they differ in scope from games like EverQuest in their design goals, so I didn’t focus on them, this being more of an EverQuest site and focussed more on online RPGs.</P>
