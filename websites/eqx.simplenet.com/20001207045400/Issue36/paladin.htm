<p style="text-align: justify">

	Paladins capture our imagination for many reasons.  The idea of a selfless hero, a champion of the downtrodden, a holy warrior using his/her martial gifts to overcome evil, and protect the weak is an icon which brings us hope and inspires courage.  Where did this ideal warrior come from?  The paladin is not a typical hero, because there is an added element of selflessness and piety that a Conan or Odysseus does not have.  The paladin is above all a hero above reproach, whose dedication to lofty ideals places him/her beyond the reach of the typical hero.
<br><br>
	The term paladin refers to any warrior of the palace, but came to be associated with the <a href=" http://www.chronique.com/Library/MedHistory/charlemagne.htm">Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne</a>, the 8th century Frank who ruled most of Europe and recreated, for a short time, the Holy Roman Empire.  These warriors were Charlemagne's personal bodyguard, fierce warriors whose deeds in their own right were enough to distinguish them from the ordinary.  One of these Paladins, Roland, came to represent the ideal we now hold for a paladin through his actions in one of Charlemagne's few defeats.
<br><br>
	When Charlemagne had been in Spain for about six years, he sent Ganelon, one of his paladins, on an embassy to a pagan king in Saragossa.  Out of jealousy, Ganelon betrayed the route of the Christian army on the return trip to France, and the pagan king assaulted the rearguard of the army, led by Roland, at the pass at Roncevalles.  Many of Charlemagne's paladins were in that army of 20,000 knights and warriors.  Attacked by a Saracen force of 100,000, Roland and the paladins slew them all, until there were none but 50 of the original 20,000 of the rearguard.  When another army of 50,000 attacked, Roland finally blew his enchanted horn, Olivant, to notify Charlemagne, who was riding at the head of the army, of the attack.  The treacherous Ganelon convinced the king that Roland was merely hunting, thus leaving the rearguard to it's fate.  On the third mighty blast of Olivant, the horn cracked in two, birds were slain mid-flight, and the Saracens were thrown into a panic.  Having received his death wound, Roland tried to smash his sword, Durandal, against rocks to break it so that none of the enemy could use it. The blade was so strong, however, he could not break it, so he threw it in a stream to hide it forever.
<br><br>
	This tale is related in the epic <a href=" http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/Roland/">Song of Roland</a> a 4,000 line poem written in the 11th century by the <a href="../Issue22/troubador.htm">troubadour</a> Theroulde. As one of the Chansons de Gestes", or "songs of deeds", it set the ideal behavior for a knight by illustrating them in Rolands actions.   This code of chivalry is set down below.  Though never really laid down exactly this way, this list contains the main standards a knight was expected to live by.
<br><br>
<p align="center">
I. Live to serve king and country.<br>
II. Live one's life so that it is worthy of respect and honor.<br>
III. Live for freedom, justice and all that is good.<br>
IV. Choose death before dishonor. <br>
V. Never attack an unarmed foe. <br>
VI. Avoid lying to your fellow man. <br>
VII. Administer justice. <br>
VIII. Defend the weak and innocent. <br>
IX. Destroy evil in all of its monstrous forms. <br>
X. Show respect to authority. <br>
XI. Exhibit manners. <br>
XII. Do not allow anger to blind you, a cool head will win the day. <br>
XIII. Exhibit courage in word and deed. <br>
XIV. Never abandon a friend, ally, or noble cause. <br>
XV. Never betray a confidence or comrade. <br>
XVI. Remain loyal to one's friends and those who lay their trust in thee. <br>
XVII. Fight with honor.<br> 
XVIII. Die with honor.

	There are other examples of fictional paladins in the tales of King Arthur and his knights, but I want to move on the real knightly orders which grew from the chivalric ideal and the crusades.
<br><br>
<b>The Crusades</b>
<br><br>
	Although it was unlikely that Pope Urban II's expectations when he called for Christendom to go to war for Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre were to be as wildly fulfilled as the resulting First Crusade, the seeds for a holy cause were existent in the culture of the time.  Political chaos and violence in 11th century France had created a group of men whose main vocation was warfare.  The Church, in turn called for the Peace of God to quell the battling nobles.  A knight who considered himself a Christian then had a conflict. How to do God's work and, at the same time, do what they did best?  A Crusade was the perfect answer.
<br><br>
	Knights from all over Europe streamed into Italy and on to the Holy Land.  After their conquest of Jerusalem, a monk named Gerard founded hostels in Provence and Italy to care for wounded and sick pilgrims en route to the Holy Land.  Knights, grateful for the respite and healing offered by these hostels, bestowed upon it parts of their estates or went on themselves to continue the work of the <a href=" http://web.mit.edu/redingtn/www/ecole/ksj.html">Hospitallers</a>.  This loose grouping of knights and monks came to be a wealthy and powerful body dedicated to tending the sick and poor and waging war in the Holy Land.
<br><br>
	Also during this time, eight or nine French knights, led by Hugues de Payens, vowed to devote themselves to the protection of travelers and crusaders in the Holy Land.  The King of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, gave them quarters in a wing in the area of the former Jewish Temple, and from this came their name: <a href="http://www.intranet.ca/~magicworks/knights/next.html">The Knights Templar</a>.
<br><br>
	Divided into four classes: knights, sergeants, chaplains and servants the Knights Templar performed brave deeds in the Holy Land, and gained adherents due to their renown and the propaganda of Bernard of Clairveaux, a leading cleric who wrote their Rule of Life.  Each Templar took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to their master and the Church.  Later placed under the pope's authority, the Templars became a vital element of the defense of the Christian crusader states.  At their height, they numbered 20,000 knights.  Later on, because of gifts and endowments on the order, they came to be incredibly wealthy, and may have developed the first banking system in the Western World.  In part due to debts owed the Knights Templar and simple greed, King Philip the Fair in 1307 accused the Order of heresy and immorality and tortured many into confessing false crimes.  The bulk of the Templars' property was transferred to the state, quite conveniently for Philip.
<br><br>
	These knightly orders solidified and organized the ideal of the noble warrior fighting for the good 
of all.  From the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne, the holy knight dedicated to fighting evil and protecting the innocent and helpless became a part of Western culture and history as a variation of the heroic ideal.  From the Arthurian tales in the late 11th and early 12th century to TV westerns starring a man known as "Paladin", the role of a powerful warrior fighting for the common good has captured our imagination. Here, now, in EverQuest we get the chance to fulfill this role, defeat evil and serve the common good.  Let us hope that we, like Roland, can die with honor and valor for a cause that is good and just.
