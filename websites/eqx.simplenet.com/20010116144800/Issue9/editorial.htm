<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 9!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
I'm sure you have all heard that the new date for the beta applications is early March.  
I am actually restraining my excitement.  But I am trying to hurry up and finish playing 
several other games and projects before then, just in case.  :)
<br><br>
There have been a few questions about submissions to EQX from folks that are not on our staff.  
We encourage it!  Please, if you have something to say, and you can write it up in a well 
thought out manner, then send it to us.  There are, at this time, two formats in which we can 
accept your submissions.  Articles and letters to the editor.  Letters should be responses to 
any of our previous issues or article, comments about our work (good or bad) and things like that.  
Articles should be complete by themselves and are generally longer.  If you have something to 
say but don't know which category it falls into, ask.  But we try to publish any well written work.
<br><br>
Actually, I forgot a category.  We are also still looking for good stories for the Tales of Rose
and Blade section.  Just because we haven't published any lately doesn't mean we don't want to.  
In fact, exactly the opposite is true.  So if you want us to publish your tale, send it in.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
