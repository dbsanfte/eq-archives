A plain with two walls, two walls that are closing on one another with each passing second. Magic? No, look closer. You can see the bricks of the walls, however, they are not made of stone. Each stone is alive, different from the next but still moving perfectly in time with the rest. The bricks are strong, do not be fooled by their size my friend, they are strong. Yet, one brick does not a wall make. This wall is many times stronger than the sum of its parts. Why you ask? Because the bricks are men, men from every corner of Norrath. Alone they are merely a scattering of rocks, but together my friend, together they make the Gods tremble.
<br><br>
"What do those cowards think they are doing?" Screamed Lord Griffith, ejecting large lumps of roast duck from his mouth onto his  painstakingly embroidered robe.  One of the shorter, plate mail clad knights arrayed before him cleared his throat before answering his fraught Lord.
<br><br>
"My Lord, they appear to be..."
<br><br>
"Fools, all of you fools," the obese Lord ranted, cutting him off.  "You ask for horses, I give you horses.  You ask for gold, why, I give you gold. Why can you not fight like the men you are, do I have to draw sword myself to get this war over and done with?"
<br><br>
"But My Lord!" The short knight exclaimed, "Every time we advance ten yards, they retreat another fifteen and pelt us with those confounded darts. We've lost eight men already this morning and the only losses they have taken are those who injured themselves laughing at our fruitless efforts."
<br><br>
"Pah! You lying dog! You are letting yourselves be beaten by these children to try and dishonor me! Do not deny it! I know..." the Lord was well into another torrent when another of the Knights brought his fist down on the oak-feasting table.
<br><br>
"My Lord," the insolent knight said calmly, "warfare is our business, it is what you pay us for is it not? Why, a king such as yourself has no place on a battlefield, you are much needed back at the keep. My Lord, why do you not return to your work, and I will see to solving this situation."
<br><br>
Every eye in the room turned immediately to the knight, jaws dropped and gasps of disbelief were emitted at the apparent insolence of the knights words.  Lord Griffith however, had a look of sheer admiration on his face; he barely noticed the upset bottle of wine now spreading it's way across the table. He chuckled quietly before speaking. The knight who had dared to speak to him so rudely was still standing tall before him, a calm expression on his face, waiting for his Lords reply.
<br><br>
"Sir Maelstig if I am not mistaken," Griffith said calmly, looking the knight straight in the eye. "Your confidence in yourself is, ah, refreshing to say the least. Very well, your wishes are granted. I will leave immediately, and as for you my loyal servant, you are in command of my army."
<br><br>
The other knights blinked, several serving girls fainted, but Maelstig stood calmly, and nodded slightly.  "As you wish My Lord, I will return to the keep in two days."
<br><br>
"I hope you do, good knight" Griffith said slowly while staring deep into the red pool, still meandering it's way across the table "I hope you do, for your sake."
<br><br>
Maelstig watched the last carts of his Lords procession enter the gloomy forest. He thrust his mind into gear, turning briskly he began to bark orders at the knights standing behind him who were still grumbling about their Lords reaction, they had all hoped for a hanging. Maelstig sent some of the more disgruntled knights to ready the men for battle, some to see about dismantling the camp tents, and the rest to join him in counsel around the fire.
<br><br>
The four knights he had selected to join him in counsel were those who he felt were true warriors, and good men. He had watched each of them since his coming to Lord Griffith's House.  The first to take a seat at the campfire was young Sir Llachnas. His fiery red hair perfectly complemented his personality. Foolish and headstrong, Maelstig thought to himself, ah it was not so long ago that his own mentor had called him such words. The other three knights were older men. Each had beards appropriate to his age. The oldest was Sir Cammel, a veteran of battle and no stranger to blood and carnage. Sir Lucthor and Sir Locter were brothers in blood, and in battle. Maelstig had observed that they were rarely apart, working harder than oxen in the day, and drinking enough ale for an entire army at night. Maelstig hoped that between the four of them they would prepare a flawless battle plan. His motivation was not the implied threat of Lord Griffith; such things held little fire in Maelstig's mind. His motivation was now his honor, he had given his word that he would return in two days, and that is what would happen.  Maelstig waited until the knights around him were at ease, and began to break the ice.  "I understand that my authority here came a little unexpectedly. I know some of the other knights will have trouble accepting me, especially your former War Chief. However, I believe none of you will hold such reservations."
<br><br>
Sir Lucthor was the first to reply, "Let it be known that none of us here held much love for your predecessor, your promotion may be a blessing or a curse, yet I believe you can do little to worsen this situation for us."
<br><br>
The rest of the knights nodded in agreement with these words, and turned their camp chairs to face Maelstig.
<br><br>
"Then let us waste no more time" Maelstig said quickly "We must return to the keep in two days, that will allow us the rest of this day on the battlefield, and then we must begin our march the following morning.  If I am right in my observations, we have a force two hundred strong. One hundred being foot troops of the Qeynos area, fifty archers also from Qeynos, and fifty mounted knights including ourselves. Sir Cammel, have the scouts returned with an accurate count on our enemy?"
<br><br>
"Aye Sir, there are much fewer than we first believed. They counted fifty-seven men; all armed with bows but with no armour, that is how they have been escaping from us so easily. There are also forty women and children, some of whom have bows also. Every one of them has a mount, Marr knows where they got them from!"
<br><br>
Maelstig looked thoughtful awhile before speaking. "Tis strange indeed, I have never known of barbarians to have such large numbers of horse, and fine stock they must be to keep us running after them all this time."
<br><br>
"There is one more thing the scouts reported," Sir Cammel added carefully. "The breed of the horses is much like that of the Freeport militia. The scout said the horses were covered in mud but the markings were quite clear."
<br><br>
"Yes that would explain much," murmured Maelstig, amid a general groaning from the rest of his assembly. "However that can be dealt with later, we will keep to the matter in hand for now. Locter, what is your opinion on the lie of the land."
<br><br>
"Sir, the land between ourselves and the enemy has changed little from our last advance. The same boggy gashed land making our horses virtually unusable. Unfortunately this time they are camped on a slight hill, however I did notice one thing that could be useful. The ground above their camp looks muddy and unstable, I believe if it rains they would be forced to move back down to our level."
<br><br>
Maelstig cast his eyes up to the sky above. Not a cloud in sight, and the sun was already disappearing below the horizon. With the barbarians on solid ground they would have no trouble escaping over the hill while the Lords troops floundered in the stinking bogs.  Maelstig's heart was beginning to sink when Cammel raised his head quickly and said, "Sir, I believe I may have an idea."

The last rays of the sun were finally blocked by the hills of the Western Commonlands. Muccassin paced along the southern boundary of their camp, he knew the knights were up to something, they had never waited this long to attack before. His thoughts were disturbed by a pattering of feet approaching him. Swinging quickly around in a half combat stance, he glanced upon his assailant.
<br><br>
"Father!" The young warrior shouted gleefully jumping into Muccassin's arms.
<br><br>
"Macsen! Did I not tell you to look after your mother Come now, I want you far away from this line when the knights attack."
<br><br>
"But father. I could not sleep, every time I close my eyes I think of Grandfather, and I know I will never see him again, but I still want him to come back."
<br><br>
"Macsen," Muccassin said quietly, "your Grandfather is with the Gods now, if you look up to the sky you will see his star, and he will know that you are thinking of him."  Little Macsen pondered this for a while, Muccassin could not help but smile at the little creases appearing on his young forehead.  "Ah yes, you are much like your Grandfather after all. Come now let us get you back to your mother before she roasts me like a goose."
<br><br>
"But father," Macsen said innocently, "where are the stars?"
<br><br>
Mucassin looked up. Rubbing his eyes, he looked again. He saw nothing, not a bird, not a cloud, not a star. But there was something else. What was that sound? A rumbling, growing louder and louder. It was thunder! But there were no clouds! Those vile human Gods were sending rain to force them to advance to the lower ground.  He roared a great command to stir his people for readiness.
<br><br>
"Macsen run back to your mother, tell her we must get off this hill!" Muccassin said harshly. He ran towards the fear stricken horses while formulating an escape plan in his mind. Damn the Militia for making us begin this war, he thought to himself.
<br><br>
He had almost made it to their tethered mounts when a cry arose from the Southern sentry post. He could not believe what he saw when he turned.  Dozens of foot troops without armor were cutting a swathe into their camp.  Two or more humans were striking down his men, before they even had a chance to arm a sword. Muccassin realized at once what had happened. He ripped his great battle-axe from the bindings on his back and screamed as the war frenzy overtook him. The Gods know he fairly stopped the human advance by himself! Hewing bone, and carving flesh with each swing of his axe.
<br><br>
A small group of Barbarians stood back to back on that hill in the twilight, fighting for each other's lives. But slowly, so slowly, they were being pushed back towards their companions. They died with honor that night; they would have had it no other way.
<br><br>
Maelstig watched the funeral pyre's burning brightly, as the first hints of morning light began to show themselves. Sir Cammel's plan had worked flawlessly.  The Qeynos warriors led by him had ditched their armor in the fashion of the barbarians, allowing them to quickly move across the marsh.  With the archers making such a tremendous din, by bashing the abandoned shields with their sword hilts the superstitious barbarians would have been thrown into confusion. He had counted on them believing rain was coming, which they clearly did, rushing off the hills into his awaiting troops.  However, he was not at rest after completing his task. There was one thing he did still not understand. And it filled his thoughts all the way back to Griffith's keep. When questioned by Sir Lucthor, who saw him clearly troubled, this was all he would say.
<br><br>
"After our victory, I gave thanks to Mithaniel for our lives, and our glory. But on completion of my prayer, I saw not one star, not a single star in the sky, to greet me. Truly God is good, and this act a blessing on all of us, but..." he walked away without finishing.
<br><br>
That night a young barbarian warrior slept alone on the hills.
