<H1> Q & A </H1>
<HR>
<br>
<I><B>Q:</B> When can we buy the final game?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> I assume a few days after it begins shipping.  No date has been announced yet.

<BR><BR>
 
<I><B>Q:</B> Is the bow and arrow a useful weapon in EverQuest? Have you seen anyone use a bow with good effect? </I><BR>
<B>A:</B> It is not as useful as it should be for a Ranger, in my opinion.  However, used properly in conjunction with other effects, it can be a useful and deadly weapon.

<I><B>Q:</B> How do battles work? Do you have to click for every hit you make, or do you attack and watch your character do the job? Or maybe in between? </I><BR>
<B>A:</B> You get close to your target and turn on attack mode.  This gives you automatic basic combat.  However, to fully utilize your character, you will have to manually click on combat skills such as Kick, or on spells such as Minor Healing.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> After getting further in the game, will your attributes stop going up (Strength, intelligence, etc.)?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Your attributes will never naturally increase.  Your skills will go up as you increase in levels, but your attributes can only temporarily increase by wearing magic items or through spell effects.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> What is the highest level attainable at a regular rate in the game?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> The highest level you can achieve is currently level 50.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Is there any cap on skills?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Each class has a different max for various skills at each level.  Some races also have inherent skills, which give them higher maxes.  Typically your skill will increase 5 points at each level, but it depends on the skill, your race, and your class.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Do spell effects, damage, or duration increase as you level increases? In other words, would a first level direct damage spell be more effective cast by a higher level mage?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> Absolutely.  A mage may find his newly acquired damage spell is not as good as the one he achieved 4 levels back.  However, as his skill and level increase, the new spell will begin to work more efficiently and will replace the old one.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Are you the same Wynn from server 107 in M59?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> No.  Wynn seems to be a common enough name that you may have seen another one somewhere.  However, I have not used the name in any other games so far.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> I heard bards can wear plate mail armor.  How is it that they can play an instrument with plate gloves and arms?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> The same question applies to all magic classes and hybrids.  The answer lies in the old realism vs gameplay debate.  Do you want a game so realistic that you need to pause thrice a day to use the bathroom?  Do you want to sit and do nothing for the 8 hours your character sleeps?  Obviously not.  Any game developer must make some realism concessions in order to make the game playable and enjoyable.  So, while it may not make real life sense in every respect, it makes the game fun to play.  Besides, who says you can't beat a drum while wearing plate?

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B> Why would I want to spend a training point and pay money to increase a skill, when I can increase it for free through practice?</I><BR>
<B>A:</B> You will typically spend your training on newly acquired skills, to get them to a decent level so that you can increase the rest through practice.  Some skills advance very slowly, or are used so infrequently that practice is not practical.  In these cases, you may find the training worthwhile.
