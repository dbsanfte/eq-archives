<p style="text-align: justify">

	Jarel finished attending to the animals in the cages stacked ceiling-high around the walls of his cabin and filled a pitcher with water from the backyard well for the injured birds in the aviary. The dawn was not far off as he approached the enclosure, already turning the sky a deep turquoise and bleeding from the blackness of night the principle beacons' dimmer brethren.
<br><br>
 	A peeping from the top of the wicker cage drew his attention to where a small blue Arengal Pigeon sat chirping merrily, a tan package tied around one leg. Jarel had not expected another message from his "spy" so soon. He pursed his lips and whistled in imitation of the little bird's mating call. The tiny thing fluttered to him and landed delicately on his outstretched arm. He undid the knots in the cord tying the message to the bird's leg and carefully unrolled the scrap of sheepskin. Another map, this time the prize he had been awaiting: the castle! Or at least a portion of it. Any map of the castle was a signal Groal was ready to move. 'So they have not yet clapped Groal in irons', he thought. The risky venture upon which he had set his adopted son was nearing it's conclusion. It was time to act instead of plan and worry.
<br><br>
 	Jarel returned to his dwelling and began gathering together the armaments he and Goal would need to finish this terrible business. It seemed the fates demanded Jarel remain a warrior despite his renunciation of his former ways. Surely there was some mitigating factor in defending his adopted son. Perhaps not. It didn't matter. Jarel was well used to doing what was required of the situation regardless of the morality of his actions. 'Hell be damned', he thought. 'Heaven be damned. The Gods be damned!' There was only Groal to consider now.
<br><br>
	Groal considered the odds. A dozen Trolls, each taller than himself, against his tiny assassin's knife. And his Shadow Knight skills. 'I must surely die', he thought, 'but I will not let this…atrocity…proceed'. Groal reached into his robe and pulled out an orange vial. He pulled out the cork and drained the contents. Instantly, an invigorating rush suffused his entire body and mind. He stepped silently into the underground cathedral and moving quickly and deadly to his left struck once, twice, thrice and three gray robed trolls fell. The clattering of the three massive trolls falling dead to the floor brought the entire ritual to a halt. Nine trolls turned their attention upon the intruder. The tall troll leading the marchers swung his ceremonial knife in a great whistling arc and in a voice hissing with outrage demanded his acolytes attack the blasphemer.
<br><br>
	"<em>Arguls ness fens wissrens gilssmanorsh</em>!" He commanded in the hideous Troll tongue. In a rattle of metal the acolytes drew from their robes swords and daggers. They charged the squat shadow standing back-lit by the flickering light of the smoking lanterns hanging from the ceiling on wrought iron chains.
<br><br>
The initial attack was clumsy and Groal easily sliced open the throats of the first two trolls to reach him. As their black blood flew from his furious counter assault, he dove to the floor and rolled on his back around the trolls coming from behind and standing, flashed his small dagger with a preternatural speed, cutting them down. In a span of seconds, he had reduced his foes to five. The others kept their distance from Groal's deadly blade, backing off and arranging themselves in an organized formation. These were warrior priests from Grobb, trained in the arts martial and spiritual. The advantage of surprise was gone and now Groal was merely outnumbered by warriors larger than he and nearly as skilled.
 <br><br>
They pressed their numerical advantage, spreading to Groal's left and right, attacking on two fronts. As they approached him, two to his left, three on the right, Groal leapt up to grab the lamp hanging directly over the altar; swinging himself on the chain in an arc around the trolls coming from his left and landing behind them. He had put one group between the other. Troll blood splattered the walls as he danced forward between the two closest warrior priests in a maneuver Jarel called the 'Dragon Fly Mating'. Now he stood facing only three of the gray robed trolls, their brother priests lying dead at Groal's feet. He remained unscathed, not even breathing hard. He smiled. They attacked.
<br><br>
	The last of the warriors in gray were more cautious than their brethren. They spread themselves out quickly, and one bent to retrieve a sword to replace his small dagger. He never reached it for the small ogre's knife spun through the dimness and embedded itself to the hilt in his neck. Groal, now unarmed, dove to the floor and rolled away from the remaining two, grabbing a blood slicked sword as he stood to face the last of the trolls. He placed his right foot in front of his left as he had been taught and sidled forward, driving the trolls into a corner. They slashed viciously at the flashing sword, seeking an opening. Groal feinted to his right and one of the trolls stepped into Groal's trap. Switching the sword to his left hand he parried the attack and with a quick side step, plunged his sword through the troll's mid-section. His weapon was pulled from his grip as the troll fell dead and once again unarmed, he turned to face the final foe. The tall warrior grinned a nasty grin and raising his own weapon over his head, prepared to deal the death stroke. The sword sung through the air, passed the space where Groal had been standing and rang against the stone floor, breaking in two. As a paralyzing numbness ran up the troll's arm, Groal jumped at him and wrapped his powerful fingers around the muscular throat of his enemy. The grin never left the troll's face as his throat was crushed beneath the little ogre's hands. He made small gurgling noises as he lay dying at Groal's feet. A shuffling sound turned Groal's attention to the altar where the tall leader of the disrupted ceremony stood. He approached slowly, wary of the large blade still held in the green one's hand.
<br><br>
"Hold, little one", the tall priest spoke. " You have no idea who I am. My death at your hands will hold grave consequences you cannot imagine. I am Kinlack, Ambassador to Oggok." The thick trollish accent did not disguise the tall troll's words and Groal's heart leaped in his chest to find itself face to face with one of the architects of his people's betrayal.
<br><br>
"Untie the girl", he said.
<br><br>
"Yes, of course", Kinlack said and bent to do as he had been instructed. As the final bonds were cut Groal stepped around the altar to face Kinlack.
<br><br>
"Now, Ambassador, we have something to discuss."
<br><br>
Before he had a chance to respond, Kinlack found himself in headlock grip such as he knew the Shadow Knights of  the Dark Elves were taught. Where did this strange and dangerous young ogre learn such tricks, he wondered. His mouth was prised open and he tasted a few drops of some bitter substance the little ogre dropped down his throat from a small purple vial he had produced from the folds of his robe. A dullness took over his mind and he sat quietly where the ogre dragged him, not even attempting to escape or move.
<br><br>
The sacrificial girl ogre was still trying to sit upright as Groal handed her a bloodied gray robe.
<br><br>
"Put this on", he told her. His eyes avoided her naked form and as he turned from her back to Kinlack he thought her the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. A large wine red birthmark covered half her face in an intoxicating stain that added to her great beauty. Yellow teeth grew haphazardly behind thick purple lips and her small lashless eyes looked up at him gratefully. He tried to put her out of his mind and focus on what he must learn from the troll Ambassador. Groal squatted before the drugged Kinlack.
<br><br>
"Ambassador". Kinlack's eyes wandered aimlessly in his head as he tried to look directly at his inquisitor. "Tell me what the trolls are doing with the children the council lets you take back to Grobb."
<br><br>
"Sweet ogre pie", the Ambassador sang. "Oh, delicious young ogre roast. Or fried. So very, very tasty."
<br><br>
"Why did they murder Grumthor?"
<br><br>
"Why? Because he opposed them, of course. He would have told all of Oggok and that would never do. Nope, nope, nope. Never do. Hahaha." Kinlack's head lolled side to side and he seemed to be trying to focus on something in the distance.
<br><br>
"Why is Thrack poisoning Barbergan?"
<br><br>
" So Thrack and Thrack alone will rule the council. Then, he will declare himself King. After all, the true descendants of the last King of Oggok are all dead now. After we killed Grumthor and his family. Hahaha. The old fool never knew of his relation to Old King Kilgor. Or his wife's for that matter. Together, they produced the only rightful heir to that long abandoned throne. But they're all dead now. Dead, dead, dead."
<br><br>
"Is that why he arranged the trade with Grobb? Arms in exchange for ogre children?"
<br><br>
"Yup, yup, yup. How else could he build the army he would need to face the resistance he would face? And the children are sooooooo delicious. My, my, my."
<br><br>
"There must be more than that in it for Grobb. What else did you hope to gain?"
<br><br>
"With Thrack as King of Oggok, we would make a mighty army of trolls and ogres to conquer all of Antonica. We would let the ogres take the brunt of the fighting, of course, and weaken themselves. Then, after the conquest, we would in turn conquer the ogres. Hahahaha. Soon, Grobb will rule Antonica and then all of Norrath. Hahahaha."
<br><br>
Groal stood and looked down on Kinlack in disgust and horror. He turned his back to the tall troll and picked up the ceremonial knife from where Kinlack had dropped it. He turned it slowly in his hands. The edge was very keen and he cut his thumb feeling along it. He handed it to the nearly insensate troll and said, " Cut your throat open. A deep cut. Try to remove your head."
<br><br>
"Certainly. Hahaha. A most reasonable request." Kinlack took the knife and without the slightest hesitation ran the blade under his chin. He slumped to the floor, his black blood gushing from the wound in great gouts of gore, his nearly severed head hanging unaturally from his shoulders.
<br><br>
"Is he dead?"
<br><br>
Groal turned a triumphant gaze in the direction of the altar from where the soft question had come. The young girl sat there, looking at him with fear and hope twinkling together in the small black eyes glittering like obsidian in the smoky light, large and afraid.
<br><br>
"They are all dead", he said looking deeply into those dark pools before him. He forgot where he was, what he had done and been told. It was as though he had been cast into another prison cell and all reality was contained in those ebony eyes. "I…I…killed them. Are you all right?"
<br><br>
"Well, considering I've been kidnapped, gagged, dragged through the city in a burlap bag, tied to an alter and nearly killed, I'm fine. How are you?"
<br><br>
Groal stood there, dumbstruck. A little silence passed between them and Groal saw the slight smirk on the face of the lovely girl. Simultaneously they burst out in the hacking growl that passed for an ogre's laugh. The ogress stood and wrapping both arms around Groal hugged him hard, looking up at him and whispering, "Thank you. You were really quite amazing." She let go of him, holding him at arm's length by the wrists.
<br><br>
Groal cleared his throat. He didn't know what to say. He cleared his throat again. "Um…..", was as far as he got as he tried to say something intelligible.
<br><br>
"Let's get out of here", she said. "My name is Dalgra. And you are……?"
<br><br>
"Groal. I'm not sure where we are", he told her. " I escaped from the prison cells just a short time ago. I found you while I was searching for a way out."
<br><br>
"The dungeon, hm? Upstream from here or down?"
<br><br>
"Downstream. I already tried going that way."
<br><br>
"Oh, no. Not downstream from the cells. That grate is new. My uncle put it up last year after old lady Grockick found me going in one day. 'It's not seemly for a daughter of the Ruling caste to be seen crawling in the sewers', he told me. Anyway, if we are upstream from the dungeons we need to continue climbing and bear left. We'll come out at the South Gate."
<br><br>
"How are you so sure"
<br><br>
"I've played in these sewers and catacombs since I was a little girl. They're fun. Or were until tonight. Come on." She let go of Groal's hands and started toward the opening from which Groal had entered. "Grab a lamp", she said over her shoulder as she entered the tunnel
<br><br>
"Um… ok. Wait a second", he said to her back. He reached up to one of the lamps hanging from the ceiling and took it off the hook.  Holding it by the cool bottom, he followed her into the underground passage.
