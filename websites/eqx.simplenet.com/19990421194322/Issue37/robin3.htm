Elaan planted both his feet.  Most likely he would only be able to engage a few of the, how many… twelve, Dark Elves.  He saw the group split up.  Three, probably the strongest, were headed towards him, the others would go around.  He knew that the villagers would be slaughtered, and probably his friends too.  His three opponents were no less than twenty feet from him when the hair on the back of his neck stood straight up.  He heard a subtle snapping, the kind of sound that can be the only thing to save your life from the knife of an assassin.  Despite the sharp blades of the Dark Elves, Elaan turned his head to see what terrible thing it was that was behind him, for he knew it would kill him.  He was prepared to face death, however, so it was only his head that turned.  He would see his fate, even if he could not stop it.
<br><br>
Directly behind Elaan were the Human townsfolk.  He saw that many of them had passed out.  Several more, perhaps the braver ones, were fleeing and screaming in terror.  Because the crowd had cleared he could also see Oghma, Amlaith and Mundas.  The Dwarven bard was crouched and had a terrible look of fear on his face, a look that Elaan assumed was on his own face as well.  Even the stoic Amlaith looked terrified, he seemed stunned with fear.  But the smallest person in the village, Mundas, was giggling.  Perhaps that was his reaction to fear.
<br><br>
But Elaan saw nothing that warranted this fear.  He returned his gaze to the Dark Elves.
<br><br>
They too had turned, seeking the source of their fear.  But they were also looking to their rear for the source, the exact opposite direction that he had felt it come from.  Something seemed very wrong about all of this.  But Elaan decided that if he must die, he would take several of this hated enemies with him.  He charged the three Dark Elves, hoping to get to them while they were still turned.
<br><br>
Thirty yards away in the center of the village, Mundas was trying very hard not to laugh too loudly, as such a thing could possibly break the spell.  He watched as, unfortunately, all of his friends reacted to his trick.  But it would give him time to rescue the Dark Elves from the fire.  He was not entirely sure why even Oghma would want to save them.  Dark Elves usually proved to be very unpleasant company.  He shook his head and jogged over toward the fire.  He stopped half way there and tossed a worried glance back at all his worldly possessions, his whole life's work, scattered on the well trodden grass of the village square.  He almost went back to get them.  But he knew the fear would not last, so he pressed on.  When he arrived at the two Dark Elves he was surprised to see that one of them was calmly trying to free the other.  This task was made nearly impossible by the struggles of his companion.  Obviously being tied up added a level to the power of the fear spell that Mundas had never considered.
<br><br>
"You hold him, I'll cut the ropes.  Hurry."
<br><br>
The Dark Elf looked at the Gnome and considered his response.  "Alright," and he reached over and attempted to restrain his friend.  "That was an interesting spell.  I have never seen such an affect over such a large area, and so many victims.  How is it that you achieved that much power?"
<br><br>
Mundas shrugged.  "It's in the tools, the symbolism of the device used.  Its…  Well, it's a complicated theory that I've come up with."  Mundas took the small knife from the ground where the Dark Elf had dropped it and began to work on the bonds.  "Why does Oghma want to save you?  I mean, you're Dark Elves, nobody wants to save you."
<br><br>
"I have no idea, little Gnome."
<br><br>
"Mundas, my name is Mun…"  the introductions were cut short as Zasstryn broke free of his bonds, tossing the Gnome to the ground.  "Ooof!  Some thanks that is!"  Mundas pulled himself from the dirt and started dusting off his cherry red cape.  He frowned at the small hole that he found burnt into the knee of his yellow silk pantaloons.  Then he smiled at a realization, "I guess I'll have to shop for some cheerier clothes!"
<br><br>
Beldro did not bother to turn from his jogging pace in pursuit of his ally, Zasstryn, who had run off towards the woods.
<br><br>
Amlaith was shaken from his dark, paralyzing fear by the call of a large cat.  'Banner'.  That single thought was enough to bring him alert.  He quickly regained his senses and took in the scene before him.  The Humans were mostly fled from the town square.  The two captives were escaping towards the woods, in the same direction that Banner had called from.  And Elaan was fighting with two Dark Elves, one already dead at his feet.  The other two were fighting almost like they were just awoken from a sleep, and it appeared that Elaan would be able to defeat them easily.  But there were still nine more.  Amlaith knew that he could never take on that many.  He would need help.  He looked down at Oghma.  Certainly he could break the spell on him.  How?
<br><br>
Amlaith kicked Oghma in the seat of his pants, hard enough to lift the Dwarf from his feet.
<br><br>
"Hey!" the Dwarf cried.  That was enough for Amlaith.  Not one to waste time with explanations when there were things that needed doing, he readied his bow.  His first shot was released before Oghma could find the words to explain his indignation at such treatment.
<br><br>
"After all the times I've made deals for you, helped you with your needs in big cities, made you money for skills you would give away, and you kick me in the…  soft spot!"  But even during his angry retort Oghma was doing what he always does, evaluating and discovering.  He saw the immediate problem, the Dark Elves.  He saw Amliaths first arrow strike the one furthest from the center.  And he saw the logic.  Amlaith was trying to kill them where they would not be seen by their allies in the hope that his attacks would not break the spell.  But the spell was wearing off.  It was obvious in the movements of the Dark Elves.  They were no longer twitching their heads around seeking the source of their fear.  Oghma saw that Elaan would soon be overwhelmed, despite the fact that he had already killed two of his opponents.  The third one was active and fighting with a skill that matched Elaans.  He would need help, and right now.
<br><br>
Oghma began to sing.  His voice was deep, as is the nature of his race.  He had always preferred to study history and the great tales of Norrath.  But he had also diligently studied his vocal and instrumental training.  And his voice could invoke some powerful spells.  He could summon courage in a coward, speed in a sloth, and even bring out love from hatred when at his best.  He used it now to invoke fear.  The seeds were there.  The Dark Elves were still under the last throws of Mundas' unusual spell.  He pitched his voice to resonate in the skull, a sort of dull throbbing that would make even Elaan concerned.  The kind of sound that would lead a sleeping man to nightmares.  Then he added words to the sound, forming them at levels too deep to understand if it were not for the fact that your skull was resonating them.  He sang of the day.  He sang of the light.  He sang of the heroes of the High Elves and their greatest victories over their dark brethren.
<br><br>
Elaan blocked a deadly blow from his opponent.  As the blade clanged against his he felt something wet hit his arm.  For a second he thought it was blood and wondered if it was his or that of his nefarious opponent.  But a moment later his own arm flash by in a counterstrike and he saw that is was not blood.  It was a dark green liquid. Poison.  'Curse the darkness!' he thought.  'What cowards.  But if they must resort to this, it must be because they fear me, they fear the light!'
<br><br>
"May the daylight burn your soul!  I shall show your insides to the dawn!"  Elaan erupted in a furry that had always lead him to victory.  He swung his blade in a downward arc, directly at the Dark Elf's head.  His heavy blade broke the slimmer one and dug deeply into the faded hair and dark skin of his enemy's head. Elaan was moving to find another Dark Elf to kill even before the body could hit the ground.
<br><br>
Amlaith saw Elaan moving to engage the group that he had been firing at.  While Oghma's song had made the Dark ones fearful, it also made them defensive.  He had missed with two of the four shafts he had sent into them.  But at least one was fatal, and the other had been a crippling shot to the leg that had it's victim crawling towards the woods.  That left only two for Elaan.  He could handle them, especially in their state.  The other four had somehow gathered strength from each other and were charging Amlaith and Oghma.  The Dwarf continued to sing as he pulled his short blade from its sheath.  Amlaith knew, however, that Oghma would not be equal to two of these Dark ones.  In the five seconds that it took the enemies to reach him, Amlaith had felled one with a well placed shaft to his neck and drawn his own long blade.  He moved forward several steps, knowing that all three opponents would engage him, allowing Oghma the chance to either leave or engage one.
<br><br>
As he predicted he found himself under attack by three enemies.  Amlaith gripped his long sword with both hands.  This gave him barely enough speed and power to parry them as he retreated.  One quick step after another he was forced back.  He knew that there was no way he could take three.  Elaan might simply by the virtue of his heavy armor.  But one error in Amlaith's defenses and he would be cut.  A few cuts and he would weaken.  He knew all of this instinctively.  But Oghma's song gave him hope.  He knew that if he could just hold on Elaan would come to his aid.  Or Banner.  Where was he?
<br><br>
Oghma never preferred a fight over the many other options available to a wise Dwarf.  But he could handle a blade with some skill, and he would not allow Amlaith to die.  With all the strength of his forebearers he kicked at the legs of the nearest Dark Elf, not pausing in his song for a moment.  But the Elf was expecting his entry into the fray, and agilely avoided the kick.  The Elf looked menacing.  He moved his narrow blade with skill and speed that Oghma was not sure he could match.  But Oghma could also discern the hint of fear behind those pale red eyes.  So he continued singing and did his best to keep from dying.
<br><br>
Mundas had been following the two escaped Dark Elves.  When he heard Oghma's song he glanced back to see how his friends were doing.  He was too far away to see Elaan clearly, but he had no worry for him or Amlaith, they were trained to kill.  It was Oghma's dilemma that made him turn and start back.  But it was a voice in the woods that made him stop.  He heard a female voice coming from the darkness where several trees had grown too close together.  He could not see who spoke, the darkness was too thick for that.  He did recognized the language, though he did not know the words.
<br><br>
Zass knew the words, though, as they were spoken in the Dark Tongue of his race.  He was not sure that he recognized the voice.  But one glance at Beldro told him that he knew who she was.
<br><br>
"You traitorous brethren.  How dare you help these… pests against your own kind.  I shall see you dead for this.  Or worse."
<br><br>
Before Zass could speak he heard a low growl from the woods beyond the darkness, as if some great beast were stalking prey just out of sight.  He worried what that prey was…
