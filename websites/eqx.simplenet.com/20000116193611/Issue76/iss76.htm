<em>Every once and I while I hear about or see an act of role-playing that is so memorable that it sparks a story.  Most role-players engage in acts freighted with Destiny and Fell Swordsmen and the like, but it is the little acts which can be so profound that they can alter a character's concept and make the player a more thoughtful person.</em>

Kinory was 17, a silent and bitterly mature girl, when the final letter came.  It was not written by Gwyn, nor delivered by the battered messengers that always brought his words to their door.  Kinory was not home when it arrived, but she knew, from the moment she saw the human sitting awkwardly in their parlor, that her hope that she would see Gwyn again had died.

Okay, okay, okay.  I could have simply named this article "Ramble Along with Archanalia".  Like many of my articles, this one has a split focus.  In the first part I would like to discuss article last issue.  The second part will be (hopefully) useful information about interaction between the sexes in games.

	"Ah, But you do not know, as of yet, the wisdoms spoken in M'Lord's words.  Not many are there that can fathom the depths of what IS truth and light.  I believe, though some of my brethren may not agree with me, that in order to embrace that which IS the truth is to embrace all that is!"  t'Ceira's head swam with all the twists and turns in Diane's logic.

Death.  It should be one of the biggest things on all of our minds in Norrath.  Hummm... maybe? Oh wait!  I see a hand in the front, "No mine is, Saving others!"  Good paladin answer.  Oh!  Another one, "I wanna be more Bashy!" &lt;Nods in approval&gt; I can see that... Yes you &lt;points&gt; in the back, you had an answer? "I want to confuse and live by it!"  Great!  Wonderful! What can you do as far as horned helms?

Much to my surprise, Oghma recently asked me to pen a timeline of events for how the F'leurs DuMal changed their leadership during the tumult of the transition from Beta to Final. I remember the times well, for during the final days of Phase 4, I was inducted as T'aedaryn, Dark Elf Cleric of Innoruuk, but I regretfully never got to adventure with any other FDM. During the transition, Oghma's free time dwindled and he became embroiled with the adventures of Oghma, the Dwarf Cleric, and Kakur, a fellow guildmate of ours in the StormWolves. It was not to be, though, that the FDM's evil head would remain bowed, lurking in wait, for long.

There are suddenly lots of things going on in the EverQuest community.  Much of it controversial, but then isn't it always?  The new proposed expansion pack.  The new proposed 'race war' server.  The reduction of the experience loss for death.  I'm sure there are many more, the majority of which revolve around the old "my character class sucks!" and "your character class is too powerful!" crap, which I tend to ignore anyway.  And since I like to keep this short, I'm going to ignore them now too.

I just wanted to thank Oghma for that article.  This is the first time I have read EQX and this blew me away.
Im to good with words so I'll simply say that I was hugely impressed by the whole newsletter but perticualry with that article.
Thanks and good luck for the future.
