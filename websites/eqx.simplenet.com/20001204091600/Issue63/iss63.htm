Anthiel staggered as the Gating completed, his skin crawling with the feel of the dark magic.  His guards jerked him upright again, their claws digging into his flesh.  He barely noticed.
<br><br>
 They had arrived in a rough chamber, the walls pale stone.  The sound of water echoed softly around them, and to his left, he could see the wavering reflections of diffused light on the walls and ceiling<b>...</b>

Flashbacks!  Oh, the colors!  Blue, green, black, red… I spilled my polyhedral dice from their bag onto the table.  Okay, so I'm not having your stereotypical flashbacks.  I want have a little discourse on new RPG players, and perhaps-if my brain is up to it-make a point about it all!

   In the mountains of Butcherblock, a cool breeze arose, and blew north across the land.  It ruffled the long grass, rustled among the leaves of the trees, tangled the beards of the dour guards that manned the lonely wayposts.  It passed over the hills and rocky outcroppings, carrying the scent of coal and metal working from the forges, and dipped into valleys to pick up the scent of the wild flowers and the tang of the fiery breath of drakes.  The breeze blew north, and swirled into the pass to Greater Faydark, where a lone Wood Elf stood, gazing across the distance toward Kaladim, mighty home of the Dwarven race.

A long time ago when I was a child my dad read to me the book, "The Hobbit."  At the age of seven, I was transported to the world of dragons, wizards and high adventures!  This is where my love was born for the world of fantasy books.  At the age of eight my dad bought me a great game called "The Dark Tower," again it was involving adventure and fighting and victory of conquering the Dark Tower!  By the time I was 12 years old, I was soon involved with a cousin making endless maps of dungeons and places to explore, creating a few characters and trying out Dungeons and Dragons for the first time.

Posy peeked out from the tunnel that led from the interior of Ak'anon out to the Steamfont mountains.  She had never left Ak'anon before, with it's cozy green glowtorches and the reassuring mechanical whirrs and clicks of Gnomish machinery.  Her guildmaster, the wizard Tobon Starpyre, had kicked her out of the Library Mechanomagica the day before.

The staff here at EverQuest Express thought it would be a good idea to test the guild features in EverQuest.  So we put together a 'sample' guild and a web site for that guild.  Please come by and take a look.  We will be using the F'leurs DuMal as a source of testing and story telling.  That and we are having a great time playing our Teir'dal.  Right now the F'leur DuMal are not accepting new members.

   "Turn off that computer!" Chris shouted at the top of her lungs.  
<br><br>
Jeff did his best to ignore her request, and continued to play.  There was something about spending the day at his mother in-laws that just did not appeal to him on a Saturday.  It wasn't so much the long drive to get there, or that his wife's mother was a huge nag.  It was just the fact that he would have to sit there and listen to her parents talk about all the things Jeff didn't do right as a husband.  Lectures on how they should spend their money, and what investments they should be making.

It's very late, and I am very tired.  And yet I still sit at my computer to write an editorial for this week's issue.  I must really love EQX.  Let's hope that I can keep my eyes open for the duration.  If you hear any snoring, give me a few minutes then wake me up.  After all, I have work to do here.

I just wanted to write a quick email letting you (the EQX Staff) know that I really enjoy reading your articles each week.  I especially enjoy reading Absor's editorials and Razor's insights into family (or friends) gaming with EverQuest.  I find Oghma's writings and Archanalia's art work to be interesting also.  Many other contibutors submitt fine works also.

<em>When the game no longer interests you, when you start asking yourself "what's the point?", when you're ready to just call it quits....how do different people react? The bitter? The thoughtful? The "good memories" crowd vs. the "I'm going to flame anyone and anything connected to this game" crowd. It happens in UO...it could happen anywhere.

For once it was warm in the ButcherBlock Mountains.  A place where rain was common, though plant life was scarce.  Nothing more than durable pine and the tough scrub grass grows in ButcherBlock.  In many places a dwarf can drop his pick, piercing the earth only lightly, and reach stone.  In all other places the stone tears itself from the earth, reaching for the sky with it's thick fists.
