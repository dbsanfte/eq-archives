   The air warped and shifted around Innoruuk, hiding the twisted features of the Dark Elf whose body he wore.  Reality bent and the rock beneath the Goddess turned misty, then writhed up in long ropes to wrap about her, lashing her from head to toe.  Before they stilled, however, they flexed and then exploded.  Rock shards flew in every direction, lacerating the Surefall denizens.

Alicynn realized at a rather young age that appearances are everything.  This knowledge came quick to her, for she was an ugly duckling.
<br><br>
"You must not listen to what those wicked children say," Alicynn's mother would admonish.  "They are jealous of your inner beauty, and it is they who are truly poor."

<font size="-1">
	I decided to write down some things about how the F'leurs DuMal came about to chronicle the creation of a role-playing idea and how a guild formed around it.  The best guilds out there are the ones that have a central theme the can be agreed upon by all members.  It's immaterial whether the theme is a lofty one or an evil one, as long as the members all agree on it and act accordingly.  These notes aren't really a how-to guide to guild creation, more of a how-did-we-come-up-with-this narrative. Your mileage may vary.

Well, we've done our best.  We've cajoled, poked and prodded.  We've pushed, shoved and cried out.  And Verant has done their best.  They've listened and decided, coded and programmed.  And in a few days all their work will come to you in a small plastic case, inscribed onto a small disk barely larger than the bottom side of you coffee mug.

<b>On beating EverQuest</b>
<br><br>
One of the many goals that people will have when they enter Norrath for the first time is to "beat" the game.  Diablo could be "beaten", Baldur's Gate could be "beaten", but can EQ ever truly be beaten?  How do you "win" an online world?

To the Staff at EQExpress:
<br><br>
Thank you for your time and devotion to this wonderful site. Although and
avid paper and pen role-player in my younger days, the time and connections
to continue playing fell by the wayside.  Imagine how excited I was to hear

games on my own<b>...</b>
