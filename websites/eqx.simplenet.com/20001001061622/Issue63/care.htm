Flashbacks!  Oh, the colors!  Blue, green, black, red… I spilled my polyhedral dice from their bag onto the table.  Okay, so I'm not having your stereotypical flashbacks.  I want have a little discourse on new RPG players, and perhaps-if my brain is up to it-make a point about it all!
<br><br>
This article is inspired by Absor's editorial last week on introducing yourself to RPGs.  Having had to relive the experience, I now feel uniquely qualified to claim that I'm both an expert and a beginner.
<br><br>
I've been invited to role-play with a couple of co-workers for over four years now.  So I finally broke down and did it.  One guy you wouldn't know, as he abandoned EverQuest sometime around beta 2, after a half-hearted attempt to play.  The other however is our esteemed editor, Absor.
<br><br>
So what makes a good game?
<br><br>
In my case I was living off of remembered glories; It had been about seven or eight years since I last played a paper RPG, my select group of friends having been sucked into that black hole we call "life", never to be seen again.  So as far as I could recall, a "good" role-playing game required only *my* presence, my magic fistful of dice, a pencil, clipboard, and a few sheets of paper.  Voila!  Instant fun, right?
<br><br>
They say you never forget your first time, but I suspect they are talking about something else, because I honestly can't remember my first RPG session, except to say that it was AD&D, and I was in grade school some [gasp]… 19 years ago. Yikes!  Well, it turns out I got to be a newbie again this time out. 
<br><br>
I'm going to hand you my recipe for indoctrinating new folks.
<br><br>
PATIENCE
<br><br>
We played White Wolf's "Werewolf: The apocalypse" RPG.  When I originally left RPGs due to the splintering of my group, White Wolf's initial offering using this system, "Vampire: The Masquerade", had just been released on the market, and I had not had a chance to play it.  So not only was I now trying to reconstitute my role-playing faculties, but also I had to learn a new system.  Thankfully, everyone was quite patient with me when I asked for the umpteenth time, "How do I roll for initiative again?"
<br><br>
Trust me, when you are new, then you are going to lose track of what you are rolling for.  I got to skip most of these, but if you are brand new to the game then you'll roll for damage then realize you still need to attack; You'll attack, and then discover you need to roll initiative; Then you'll attack and realize you are not the first person to get to act.
<br><br>
What makes one game system stand out from another are their rules.  This is both good and bad.  I'll show you what I mean: In a game of Werewolf, the simple procedure is to roll perception if you are surprised, roll initiative to see who attacks when, declare actions, burn "rage" points if you want more attacks, and then hop to it.  Sounds easy to a new player.  Then come the "other" rules: Burning willpower points in order to get automatic successes, splitting dice in order to do multiple actions, defaulting to dodge, etc.
<br><br>
Not all that hard in White Wolf's system, but still-when you come in to learn a system it takes a while to get a grip on all these concepts.  So it's important that whenever necessary you explain and re-explain concepts to people who are just learning.
<br><br>
ACHIEVEMENT
<br><br>
As much fun as it is to make correct deductions and figure out situations, I believe that an important part of feeling as though you are participating in a game is having a chance to make a few good ol' fashioned dice rolls.  I was going to cal this section "LOTS OF COMBAT" instead of "ACHIEVEMENT", but it's just as fun to make your computer skills roll and be the one who figures out how to download the virus into the master computer as it is to face a foe in combat.  People need achievement.  I say this at great risk to my (former) GM credibility, but NEVER let a new player walk out of a game feeling like they achieved nothing, and as the GM you have the power to make this so.
<br><br>
I guarantee you, if they can beat a foe, or at least escape him with the information they need, or otherwise either think their way out of a situation or "roll" their way out, then you have a player who is more willing to come back for another round.
<br><br>
Incidentally, I got my spine ripped out on my first outing in 8 years, but I've had characters die before, so I know the score.  If I had been a true "newbie" then perhaps I might not have found it as entertaining and come back the next week with a debilitated character.
<br><br>
NO STRESS
<br><br>
The group I fell in with for these last two RPG sessions is a pretty informal group, as all gamers seem to be.  But I do have to say that they are prone to bits of temperament, perhaps brought on by having played together for so many years.  Now I've played with far worse groups, where folks were all over each other about dumb choices, blown rolls, lack of communication, and no brotherhood.  So having a few guys jab each other was not a new experience.
<br><br>
But imagine being a new player.  You come in, sit down with a group, and when one of them makes a wrong choice the others tease them mercilessly.  If you are afraid to screw up then you are afraid to make a move.
<br><br>
Naturally, encouragement is best.  If you are the GM you might suggest a course of action.  If the player is "alone" in his setting at the time then it might be nice to let other players (for the first few sessions) make suggestions to him.  ["Do you have stealth skills?  Then you might want to sneak by them rather than running through or attacking them."]
<br><br>
Options are important.  Be there to remind new players that there is more to it than drawing your sword/pistol/crucifix/etc.
<br><br>
SNACKS
<br><br>
Don't underestimate the importance of keeping a player fed, but not so well fed that he'll fall asleep.
<br><br>
LACK OF DISTRACTION
<br><br>
It's kind of hard to get into that werewolf mood with cartoons playing on the TV or players constantly leaving for the phone, front door, etc.
<br><br>
Not an insurmountable obstacle, but mood is important in keeping people involved in any game.  And the more impressed a new player is with his environment, the more likely he is to return.  I think it helps to have mood music going.  If you are in a modern werewolf setting then anything is fine, if you're playing AD&D then you probably want something earthier.
<br><br>
My return to non-computer gaming had me in a friend's house, quite a distance from mine, but we were all around the dining room table and there was little to interfere.  If my return had fallen on this past weekend, (my second week in the campaign) where the setting was not so friendly, then I might not have returned.
<br><br>
Will all of this ensure the return of a player?  I don't know, I'm not psychic (Though I have played one from time to time).  These factors were all in play during the best games I ever participated in, as GM or player.
<br><br>
I guess the point I'm trying to make in all this is that you want to show the new player a good time.  People forget that when they invite someone new.  They often put them in a corner, help them figure a few dice rolls, and then after it's over they say "Well, did you have fun?"  The point is to keep the new player, awake, active, and wanting to take action.
<br><br>
This will be my third week back form the void that is non-participation.  For those keeping score, my spine was healed and then ripped out on an identical injury.  Not the best way to treat a new player, but even from those bad games you'll gather war stories to tell in later games when you are not so new and you are indoctrinating someone else.
<br><br>
"Did I ever tell ya 'bout the time my spine got ripped out… twice!"
