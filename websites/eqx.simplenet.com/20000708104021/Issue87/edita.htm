Alright, now I'm in trouble.  I started to write an editorial, and it turned into an article.  /em sighs.  Now I have to start all over and come up with an editorial.  Well, I know my local gaming group is probably very disappointed that I haven't talked about them lately…  /em grins wickedly…
<br><br>
The evil one isn't around.  We are, for a few weekends, free of his influence.  Beware Canada!  He's up there terrorizing the locals.  But then, anyone that plays Tanarus knows that this is nothing less than those Canadians deserve.
<br><br>
No evil GM must mean that we would have a joyful, funny, high-profit, low-stress game, right?  Well, not entirely.  One of the group decided that he wanted to run Traveler.  For those of you not familiar with this game, it's basically a space opera game.  Asteroid miners, star travel and all of the rebel vs. Empire stuff you could ask for.
<br><br>
I don't know if you read my editorial about the importance of the game setting and the relative unimportance of the game system.  I said (and it's fun to quote yourself, try it some time):  <em>" For the most part, the system is fairly unimportant. As long as it's flexible enough and robust enough to allow the GM and the players to use it the way that they want, it's fine."</em>  I was basically saying that a game setting is far more important than the system.
<br><br>
So what did we do last week?  Well, the Replacement Game Master (RGM) decided to do something strange.  He decided that he would take away the game system for Traveler, and replace it with the World of Darkness game system.  Now me, I didn't really understand this.  But then I haven't played Traveler in so many years that I just don't remember the system at all.  Maybe it did need replacing, I don't know.  I will say that our RGM put in a lot of work making up skills and background character creations information for the new system.  I certainly hope he didn't waste too much of the time that he was supposed to be using to study for the Bar Exam...  
<br><br>
But I want to thank him for the work.  He ran a great game.
<br><br>
I must say that the setting was solid and the game system didn't seem to matter.  We were N.A.S.A. astronauts, sent to Mars to find out why contact had been lost with our base there.  Upon arrival we find that there is some sort of time ripple going on, some sort of nasty and dangerous space time affect.  It is obviously emanating from what's left of the Mars base.  And it is starting to ruin our ship.  The effect is being generated by some sort of device, it's not natural.  We decide that the best thing we can do is drop a nuke on it and run like hell.
<br><br>
But the ships engines are out due to the effects of the time ripples.  So we are forced to use the experimental drive.  We drop the weapon with our fingers on the detonation button, turn our tails and flip the switch on the super drive.  This, of coarse, causes an unexpected result.  It appears that our drives interacted with the time ripples, sending a crew of adventurers from the 20th century into the future three or four thousand years.
<br><br>
And interesting setting, really.  Sure, we spent a ton of time and effort just trying to survive, putting out fires and dodging bullets (well, meteors and laser fire anyhow).  But the interesting part for me was thinking about what it would be like.  I was playing the captain of the ship.  He and his crew were, in their day, the brightest and strongest of their people.  They were the top of the heap.  Now they are, well, uneducated, less than the top of the heap.  In fact they probably know less physics than a high school kid of the future.  They feel like Medieval knights trapped in the 20th century.
<br><br>
How can they possibly be worthwhile citizens of this future?  How can they contribute?
<br><br>
Well, we haven't had a chance to explore that.  We only get one session for this game, then the evil one returns.  So we go back to our cringing and crying out for some scrap of hope and life, just the way he likes it.  Though we do have some sense that perhaps future tech can train us quickly enough to catch up.
<br><br>
We don't have that kind of chance with the Evil one...
<br><br>
Oh, hey, I do remember one thing about the Traveler system.  You get to roll dice to determine how well your military service went.  How many promotions and decorations you received are determined by dice.  But the best part, as I remember it, is that you can also die during this process.  Yup, during character generation a bad die roll just might kill ya.
<br><br>
Heck, I might just be glad to have the Evil one back...  he doesn't run Traveler...
