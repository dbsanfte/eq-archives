A dwarven one called Bord TwoAxe<br>
Was stayed near Qeynos-town.<br>
When moanings did his ears fall on--<br>
A bardling casted down.<br>
<br>
"What fate met I in Commons East,<br>
while hunting with a friend.<br>
A bear, so great, and griffon too<br>
Didst send me to my end!"<br>
<br>
The bard went on with tale of woe,<br>
"And now my pain is great-<br>
For now I be in Qeynos-town,<br>
Not close to Freeport's gate!"<br>
<br>
Bord did hear this sad, poor tale<br>
And in his heart found pity.<br>
"Come bard, and follow me this day,<br>
I'll lead to Freeport city."<br>
<br>
So Bord prepared the journey sack<br>
Of muffins and of water.<br>
For bard was penniless and sore,<br>
After his own slaughter.<br>
<br>
The two dashed east from Qeynos Hills<br>
with Selo's song were speeding.<br>
And soon were met by Bord's allies,<br>
A warrior and a halfling.<br>
<br>
The warrior tall with name of Bear,<br>
Lent strength unto their fight.<br>
The halfling quick  bore magic strong<br>
And hastened them with light.<br>
<br>
The two, now four, drove eastward then<br>
Through vast Karana plains<br>
To river serpentine where Bord<br>
Turned north and ran again.<br>
<br>
By river's edge they journeyed long<br>
Below the sight of foe.<br>
For certain death awaited them<br>
If on the plains they strode.<br>
<br>
Past bandits, gypsies, griffons too<br>
The band did keep their pace,<br>
Till ancient bridge of wood and steel<br>
Did rise before their face.<br>
<br>
They crossed and ran though light woodlands<br>
And dodg-ed cyclops' paw.<br>
Then ran northeast to canyon deep,<br>
Into Beholder's maw.<br>
<br>
A minotaur did block the way<br>
But Bord he had no fear.<br>
A mighty dwarven cry he hurled<br>
That deafened mino's ear.<br>
<br>
Fast Bord then led them right and right<br>
Across both rock and slide.<br>
Till goblin's entrance cave was seen<br>
Then Bord pressed on inside.<br>
<br>
In darkness bardling quaked and feared<br>
While goblins cast their spells,<br>
But Bord's stong hand reached back and pulled<br>
The bard on through those halls.<br>
<br>
A misty light broke caves despair,<br>
And oh! What vision blessed!<br>
A vale were haflings walked about--<br>
A vale where we could rest.<br>
<br>
Then Bord stood tall in dwarven pride<br>
The journey nearly done,<br>
And caught the bard with mirthful eye<br>
And said, "I leave you, son."<br>
<br>
"The trip you make has not much left--<br>
one danger there remains.<br>
The giants, orcs, lions, and gnolls<br>
Of Western Commonlands."<br>
<br>
The bard took little ease from Bord<br>
For giant's foot he feared<br>
Would crush him quick as had the claws<br>
Of griffon his flesh teared.<br>
<br>
But Bord he laughed and clapped bard's back<br>
"My friends will see you through.<br>
Tween bear and half, they know the path<br>
You need me not, Tis true."<br>
<br>
Reluctantly the bard went on<br>
Ahead of half and bear<br>
"Watch out!" they cried when giant spied,<br>
but bard was almost there.<br>
<br>
Ran, and ran, and ran he did,<br>
The bard was fast as wind.<br>
So did he find his corpse to loot,<br>
With help from kindly friend.<br>
<br>
Bord, and bard, and Bear, and half<br>
Did journey on that day.<br>
And gave their time in generous port,<br>
To ease an early grave.<br>
<br>
So learn from Bord, you heros bright!<br>
The kindness bravery brings.<br>
And then you too may find your name<br>
In songs that Jithri sings.<br>
