Darkness had never been my friend.  Throughout the course of my short but exciting life, the night had always seemed to bring far too much danger and mystery - things that could jump out and eat me alive if they felt the need - and that thought was never too comforting.  Being an Elf, my infravision had only helped slightly, as I could see my enemies… but not the land surrounding me.  I stroll over the wrong hill, and suddenly I'm running for my life.  Magic didn't help much either.  I had neither the bright flash of fire and ice that my Wizard kindred had nor the unique ball of light that Magicians could throw in front of them.  I was, and still am, an Enchanter, a unique class that most people seem to disregard as trivial.
<br><br>
At times, I have even thought of myself as weak, especially in the forests surrounding Felwithe.  While my Wood Elf brethren seem to enjoy their trees and…  <em>plants</em>, I much more enjoy the beautiful architecture of my marble city of Felwithe, and try to stay within its walls as much as I possibly can.  Unfortunately for me, my guildmaster and I didn't quite see eye to eye, so I ended up venturing into the forest of Faydark quite often, a forest which, by the way, is appropriately named, as it is dark <em>at least</em> fourteen hours of every day.
<br><br>
What saved me is the day that I achieved the fourth level of experience within my guild.  Happy to be allowed to buy a new set of scrolls, I ran back through Faydark into Southern Felwithe, to find that I had the opportunity to learn an amazing new spell, Invisibility.  I quickly scribed it into my spellbook and memorized it shortly afterward.  With a little trepidation, I began uttering the incantation to cast the spell, with myself as the target in mind.  After two failed attempts, I finally uttered the words correctly.  With a rush of cold air and a flash of light, I disappeared from the naked eye, including my own.  I knew I was there, but I couldn't see myself, not my hands, not my feet…  nothing!  Instantly, I saw the uses of this spell.
<br><br>
Throughout the next few days, I traveled past Faydark, through the Butcherblock and Steamfont Mountains, over the Ocean of Tears, through the City of Men, Freeport, and even into the East Commonlands.  While traveling through the Butcherblock Mountains, I happened upon a traveling companion, a Dwarf named Majico, who accompanied me throughout the rest of my journey and has since become a good (and valuable) friend.
<br><br>
He was a stout and rugged fellow, a Cleric by trade, although seemingly not too devout to his god… in fact, I could never figure out which he even worshipped.  He seemed more proud of his armor than his faith, which he had incidentally tailored himself.  In addition to all of that, he carried a slightly rusty mace and a sturdy small shield, much more protection than my own worn great staff and dark green robe.  I had only a half set of cloth armor, and that offered little protection, if any, even from the elements.  Still, through all our differences, we became fast friends throughout our journey and have been ever since.
<br><br>
He even helped me to get over my fears of the dark, which is where this story truly begins.  One day, Majico met me outside Felwithe, and we jointly ran down the northwestern road toward Kelethin, the city of my Wood Elf kinsmen.  After greeting some friends there, we swiftly took the lifts to the top levels of the multi-tiered and platformed city, where we crossed several bridges to another lift, which we descended from to a small path.  That path, my friend told me, was the trail to the orc camps.
<br><br>
"Orc camps?" I asked in the common tongue.  "You can't be serious."
<br><br>
"Of course, Diesnin, I am."  Majico said plainly.  He rarely jested.
<br><br>
"We can't possibly kill <em>those</em> orcs," I stuttered.  "There are centurions!  Centurions with BIG weapons!"
<br><br>
"We can take them, don't worry!"
<br><br>
So off he ran down the trail, myself in close pursuit.  Now, you have to understand he was a fast little man.  Before seeing him, I thought that Dwarves would undoubtedly be slow, with their thick little legs, but I was unfortunately wrong.  Within a minute, he had lost me, and I was alone in the middle of a group of orc tents.
<br><br>
To help alleviate my situation (I thought it would be helpful at the time), I yelled out loud with all the force I could muster, "MAJICO, WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GO?"  I had failed to think of the fact that, although orcs couldn't necessarily understand what I was saying, they could still undoubtedly hear that I was saying something, and then run toward it.  I turn around, and lo and behold, a single orc pawn is running at me.
<br><br>
I think to myself, "Well, Diesnin, well done, you've gotten a pawn to attack you.  No matter, I'll just kill it fast and gate back to Felwithe…  I'll be fine…  it's getting dark anyway."  As the pawn runs toward me, I think back to my guildmaster's training.  "Remember to use your spells wisely…  your power lies in your strategy, not in the spells themselves."  As the pawn runs toward me, I begin reciting a spell I learned along with Invisibility, called Color Flux.  Quickly making the motions with my hands, I unleashed a fury of color upon the area around me right as the pawn made it to me.  The bright flash blinding him, he began to flail about, yelling loudly.  I took a firm grip with both of my hands onto my staff and swung at the back of his neck.  With a loud crack, he fell to the ground.  I took his cloth cap and adorned it myself, as well as the small number of copper pieces he had on his person.  Unfortunately for me, I failed to notice that the pawn's whine had brought some friends.  Looking up from the body, two of his older brothers, orc centurions, had caught sight of my heinous act.  They both began slowly walking toward me.  Being the master of trickery that I was, I took off at a full sprint in the opposite direction.
<br><br>
For the next minute or two, I zigzagged back and forth, between trees, trying to find someone that could help me, picking up <em>another</em> centurion on the way.  They were screaming things at me, orc obscenities I'm sure, and my heart raced as they closed in.  I ran and ran, and finally, one caught me on the shoulder with his mace.  I spun to the ground, quickly picked myself up, using the centurion's kick to help push me forward.  I took off even faster than before, using every last bit of my stamina, but I knew I couldn't last too much longer.
<br><br>
After a second, I ran over a hill, and lo and behold, there was Majico, wandering the hills looking for me.  As he saw my head pop over the hill, he said, "Hey Diesnin, what's going…  IN THE NAME OF SERILIS."  Oddly enough, at the time, the only thing in my mind was, "Wow, he worships Serilis…" He immediately uttered a spell and I felt my strength suddenly return to full.  We both took off back toward Kelethin.  Unfortunately, it was too long a journey, and soon my friend fell under the blows of one of the centurions (apparently he wasn't as fast as I had seen him before.)  Quickly, I uttered the words I had learned not too long before, and his body vanished with a flash of white light.  Dazed and confused, the centurions looked around for a second.  Seeing me standing there with sparks of white arcing from my fingers, they immediately charged.  Praying to Karana with all my strength, I drew into the air the symbols of Color Flux.  A bright flash of color sprayed from my hands, and thankfully all of the centurions were stunned by it.  With the last of my mana (still praying to Karana), I again uttered the words of Invisibility and disappeared from sight.  I walked over to where Majico was supposedly laying.  When I heard him awaken from unconsciousness, I whispered to him, "Be quiet, you're magically invisible.  The road is just over there, I'll meet you at the lift."  We sneaked quietly back to the lift where I removed my shroud of enchantment.  My stout friend appeared shortly afterward, a bit shaken from his brush with death.
<br><br>
I had saved us both, and in the dark no less.  Still, with a look around to confirm the nearness of the guards, Majico quietly said to himself, "I could have taken two of them by myself…  it's just when there's more."
<br><br>
I looked at Majico, shook my head, and sat down for a long period of meditation.
