<center><big><b>	What the QUEST means in EverQuest, or how I earned my phase 1 CD.</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

	When I first saw news of Everquest, it was shortly after I started playing
Ultima Online, back in October.  As EQ progressed, I started tuning in more
and more to EQVault and the Everquest site.  I, like all of you out there,
hoped to become a beta-tester, so I posted carefully and thoughtfully, and
tried to contribute to the EQ community as a whole.
<br><br>
	Late July, I was notified that I was to become a beta-tester.  My NDA was
in the mail.  I calculated that I would be in Norrath in 10 days or so.  A
few people I know also got notified at the same time, so we cheered
ourselves and waited for the NDA to come.
<br><br>
	One by one my friends got theirs, until I was the only one without.
Everyone else had been told their CD’s were on the way, and my NDA wasn’t
even here yet!  I quickly e-mailed, and discovered that I had been
accidentally forgotten.  989 faxed me my NDA, God bless ‘em, and I signed
it and faxed it and mailed it back.
<br><br>
	By now, some of my friends were beginning to get their CD’s, but I had
another concern.  My current computer still needed an upgrade, to at least
a p200.  I had been saving for this occasion, so I ordered a p200 over the
phone and had it Fed-exed.
<br><br>
	At last, all my friends got their CD’s and mine STILL hadn’t arrived.   I
had expected to be later anyway, but I began to get paranoid.  I checked my
Credit Card, and lo! It hadn’t been charged!  I quickly ordered another,
better p300 and motherboard, since I had gotten paid.  Naturally, the day I
did that, the p200 was delivered, but since I had already canceled it I had
to send it back, and get charged a second time for shipping.  But that’s
ok, I had my other CPU on the way. Right.
<br><br>
	The last and final day that the CD should have gotten there, I didn’t
receive it.  In a panic, I e-mailed 989 again, and lo and behold, they
hadn’t sent it out!  I begged to download it, and they assented.  (Before I
go any further, let me say that no-one else had the problems I had. 989 was
quick to respond to me, and this is not in any way business as usual.  I
just.. well.. had bad luck.) Thoroughly believing that something was
against me, I checked to see if my pII was coming, since it was supposed to
be there by the day I expected was the last day to get my CD.  A quote from
the sales guy: "I remember talking to you, I just don’t know what happened
to your order!  I’m sorry."  Could he fed-ex me another, since they made
the mistake?  "Sorry, out of stock."  Oh NO!
<br><br>
	I tried re-ordering from another company, in my home state.  The guy
promised that he could get it to me by the next day, so I made up the
order, and I figured I could wait one more day.  Remember, I had the entire
EQ game on my hard drive at this point for 48 hours, and still couldn’t play it.  "What does not break me makes me stronger" became my mantra.
<br><br>
	Once again, not trusting that I would receive my new CPU, I called the guy
at the in-state store.  "Hey, your credit card wouldn’t run.  I couldn’t
order it."  WHAT???
<br><br>
	It turns out that the original p200 was still on the card, plus there was
a hold on it for the shipping and handling - Fed-ex, naturally.  WHAT MORE
COULD GO WRONG?!?
<br><br>
	I called around locally.  Prices for a pII 300 with motherboard were way
too high, but the p200MMX chip was available for the same price that I had
paid originally, for the one I sent back.  I got in my car.
<br><br>
	I hadn’t shaved for 3 days.  I was wearing the same T-shirt I had slept in
the night I downloaded the EQ files, and had hurriedly run a comb through
my hair.  My eyes were red from lack of sleep.  But I was ready.  I had the
game on my computer, all I had to do was drive 30 miles to the store with
the chip, install it on my motherboard, and I would be in Norrath.  20 days
after I had originally been notified.  All my friends were playing, and
advancing their characters.  BUT that was OK. 30 miles there, 30 miles
back, a little hardware work, and EQ was mine.
<br><br>
	I pulled up to the first stop sign outside my neighborhood, and noticed no
one around.  I turned right without stopping, like I do almost every
morning on my way to work.  Glancing in my rear-view mirror, I saw the day
take on a decidedly party-like blue and white flashing atmosphere as a
local city cop pulls me over for running a stop sign.  I could probably
have gotten away with a warning, but I looked so scruffy, it’s a wonder I
wasn’t suspected of being a drug runner.  The red eyes alone should have
pointed to some sort of illicit drug use.
<br><br>
	"What does not break me will make me stronger." "What does not break me
will make me stronger." "What does not break me will make me stronger." I
repeated this to myself over and over, and almost said it to the cop.  I
got an $85 ticket, and 3 points on my license.
<br><br>
	I drove to the shop, stopping at every light, signaling at every
lane-change, turn, or whatever, and not going over the speed limit once.  I
returned from the shop, stopping at every light, signaling at every
lane-change, turn, or whatever, and not going over the speed limit once.
Opening my computer case, without a tremble, I placed the new chip inside
the motherboard.  I carefully adjusted the voltage and clock settings.  I
entered Norrath at 2pm that day.
<br><br>
	There is a happy ending, however.  One of the first things that happened
to my character was to run across two brand new two handed swords, lying on
the ground.  I ran to the shop and cashed them in, and got an incredible
amount of money.  "Welcome to Norrath."
<br><br>
	When people talk about what they did to get into Everquest, I laugh.  I
*know* the true meaning of the word "everquest".
