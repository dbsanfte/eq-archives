<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 22!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
It has long been a passion of mine to discover the key, the Big Secret, for allowing
a computer to judge role playing ability.  I have considered as many scenarios as my
meager brain could handle.  And nothing has ever come to me that seemed even remotely
useful.
<br><br>
And then, just this weekend, I came to the realization that people aren’t too good
at judging this sort of thing either.
<br><br>
Our weekly game session just got back to being weekly this last Saturday.  We
created characters (backgrounds and all) and did the introductions and fought
our first monster together.  All the usual stuff.
<br><br>
As is standard for our group, we spent the first three or four hours just making
characters.  I have no idea why this takes so long, but it always does.  Everyone
stayed awake for this part (I point this out now because it will be useful
information when I finally get to my point).
<br><br>
Then we got started in the game.  Each of us left our place of origin to join up
with a cell of NightHunters.  This all takes place in the world of RavenLoft (I’m
sure that this name is owned by TSR, and I am grateful to them for not shutting
down this site just for mentioning it…).  For those of you that are unfamiliar with
RavenLoft, it should be enough to tell you that it is called the Demi-Plane of
Dread, a place where NOBODY goes out at night.  The NightHunter cell was, of course,
the other players characters.
<br><br>
So the next few hours were spent describing characters and discussing philosophy.
I have created a psionic character that believes that all "magic" and all "miracles"
are easily explained as mental powers that are focused through rituals or religion,
respectively.  So we had a discussion about proving such things.  As it involved
mostly myself, the Mage and the NPC cleric, several folks were left to calling each
other names and throwing food or sleeping.  Two of our players may be narcoleptic.
One was playing the mage and was awake for the entire "role playing" session.  The
other, playing a ranger, took his nap during this part of the game.
<br><br>
Then we left the sanctity of the NPC priests mountain stronghold and went into the
village.  We heard rumors of a black panther attacking villagers.  So, being heroes,
we went to destroy it.  For this we had to awaken our ranger.  While the GM was
beating him awake our mage fell asleep.  I hope all this napping attests to the
comfort level they all have in my modest apartment, not to the lack of interest in
the game.
<br><br>
So, aided much by the tracking skills of our ranger, we hunted and defeated the
panther.  There’s a lot more to it than that (like the fact that the panther had
partially eaten a young girl, and that the panther himself transformed into a
young man after we killed him, and that these facts have driven several of us
mad…), but let’s not dwell on the details.  Thus ended the game.
<br><br>
Now our GM is in the habit of assigning experience points at the end of games.  We
all consider this a great thing.  He gave us all 540 exp.  Except the mage.  He only
gave him 100.
<br><br>
I sat upright on my pillow (the best chair in my house) and raised my hand.  Our GM,
being a teacher, called on me.
<br><br>
"Yes, you there, the ugly one, what’s your name again?"
<br><br>
"Alan, sir."
<br><br>
"So what was your question?"
<br><br>
"Well, kind sir, I thought we were playing a role playing game."
<br><br>
"We are, so what?"
<br><br>
"Well, sir, you are giving less experience to Jeremy, the mage, because he missed
the fight."
<br><br>
"Yup."
<br><br>
"And you gave full experience to the Ranger, whatever his name was, even though he
slept through 75% of the game."
<br><br>
"Uh, yes…"
<br><br>
Now just because he teaches history does not mean he’s all that dense.  Really.
<br><br>
So the ranger and the mage split the 540.  After all, the mage woulda been trashed
by the panther when it attacked us from the rear…
<br><br>
For as long as I have been playing these games there has always been an emphasis on
killing things as the method for advancing a character.  How many of you avid D&D
players know that there was a role playing modifier for gaining levels in D&D?
Yup.  In the old rules the Dungeon Master was supposed to rate each player on
his/her role playing and assign a number 1-4 at the end of each adventure.  When
the character gained enough experience to raise a level the DM would average these
numbers to determine how many weeks (and therefore how much money) it would take
for the character to train up to the next level.  How many actually used it?  None,
I bet.  We never have.  It’s not real fair to force the GM to call one player a bad
role player, especially in a group like ours that has played together for over ten
years.  I guess any system for gauging role playing skill will be flawed.  And I
also like to think that our group are all good role players.  But then again, we
seem to have driven the chaf away with our two hour discussions on the nature and
sources of magic.  You see, every mage or cleric is a mentalist.  All magic is
derived from the mind.  These "wizards" and "clerics" just use their rituals and
gods as a focus for the powers of their minds…
