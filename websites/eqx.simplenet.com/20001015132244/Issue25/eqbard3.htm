I assume that skill would affect success/duration/impact of a song, so a song
could have a longer duration, do more damage, or have an enhanced effect,
such as a higher to hit bonus for a song which enhances a parties morale.

What about bards being the transmitters of culture?

This is where the PLAYER must work the hardest.  Anyone can learn and hunt
down songs and powergame a bard, but part of that gaming should be an effort
to hunt down or create clues to myths or legends.  A bard player should try
to learn as much about the world of Norrath as s/he can, to be a repository
of information.  It would be nice, also, for a bard player to create some of
the stories that add texture to the tapestry that is EverQuest.  Part of
doing quests is learning about the world of Norrath, and while you may know
exactly how to complete a quest, transmitting it in an unadorned,
step-by-step way violates the spirit of the game and the class.  Better to
write a poem with clues and hints then have a web page on how do solve X
quest.

On Wynn's chart, it shows only 3 races can be bards.  It is accepted that his
list is a pre-beta and not authoritative look at what EverQuest is doing now,
so let's talk about what races would have bards from a societal sense.  I
will let SISA do the looking at bards in a game-balance sense.
<br><br>
Any race with a substantive culture or history could have bards.  The race
also would have to be one which valued the culture they have, and create a
place in society where those that preserve it are valued.
