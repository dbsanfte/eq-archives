I have, of course, received a bit of mail as the result of my last editorial.  I really hate rehashing last weeks editorial, especially when that means that I have to re-read it myself.  So I'm not going to spend any time justifying my reasons for disliking certain names.  As someone pointed out, you either see it right off, or you don't.
<br><br>
But I want to explain quickly why this whole thing had me so riled up.
<br><br>
Ages ago I was told that SISA (989S/RedEye), the makers of the great game Tanarus, were going to do an on-line role-playing game.  So I did a bit of reading and talked to some folks.  At first I was mostly just curious, as I am more of a role-player than a computer gamer.  I knew some of the folks at RedEye, and I knew that they had skills at making these games.  But were they going to make a role-playing game, or a bigger version of Quake?  Not that I wouldn't mind a new Quake.  But I certainly wouldn't spend much effort promoting and testing it (ok, I woulda tested if they let me, but my dedication would have been somewhat less than it has been for EQ).  Then I read that they were really going to try to make this a role-playing game.  They were going to have a system of alignments (which they never elaborated on at the time, but is the faction system of today).  And they were going to REQUIRE high fantasy names.
<br><br>
This may not seem like a big deal, but it is.  Read the boards; visit the newsgroups.  You'll find a large number of people that do not want to have to fit their names into a fantasy setting, telling us that it's none of our business what names they choose.  Enforcing a naming structure on the players would not only help the atmosphere of the game, but it just might exclude the unbending, unwilling and unfriendly players out there.  Not the powergamers, 'cause they can pick any name and really care less.  No, this just might prevent the ones that insist on being MastaKilla from even playing.
<br><br>
And Redeye's willingness to stand by the role-playing theme, almost embodied by the name restriction, was what allowed me to devote myself to their product.  So when I was asked to write articles for the newly created EverQuest Express (over a year ago), I agreed.  And when it fell to me to take over, I did it.  Over the last year I've spent a LOT of time telling people how good this game will be, telling ROLE-PLAYERS how good this game will be.  Imagine how unhappy they will be with me when they get into phase 4 and run smack dab into Metallicus.  Imagine how I feel when I come to the realization that this promise of a role-playing game is becoming a bit thin.  Over the last year I've spent untold energy convincing people of something that I was starting to doubt.
<br><br>
This has nothing to do with d00dz.  This has little to do with me telling you what to do, or how to name your characters.  When I talk to players about names, it's only my right to suggest, never insist.  Only Redeye Interactive has that right.  No, it has to do with what EverQuest will be, and what I was promised it would be.  What we were all promised it would be.
<br><br>
I guess there were a few reasons behind my writing that editorial.  One was just to let out a bit of steam.  Heck, I need some personal gratification too, ya know.  One was in the hope that I could generate some chat about the topic, to help me determine where my ideas stand when compared to our readers and to the rest of the folks in the EverQuest community.  And, of course, I was hoping to stir up something at RedEye Interactive (I've decided that I like that name much better than 989 Studios, by the way).  I got lucky on all counts.  I feel much better.  Sure, a few weeks vacation would have been better, but I've learned to take what I can get.  On the second matter, well, I've never seen so many letters.  And I've been able to discuss this with folks on the newsgroup, so I think I know where my ideas fall among the rest.  Not in the middle, for sure.  In fact, read the <a href="letters.htm">letters to the editor</a> this week to get some idea on that issue.  
<br><br>
I also got a response from Steve Clover, Lead Programmer for EverQuest.  He let me know that the issue was not going to be forgotten.  He reminded me, properly so, that they are very busy making the game and that some things have slipped a bit.  The tight control on names is one of those things.  They are still working on a concrete policy for this whole naming thing.  He assured me that before phase 4 starts he will be adding more names to the filter.  And after the phase 4 CDs go out and things slow down a bit (I think he's dreaming on this part :p  ) there will be the time to straighten all of this out.  Steve insisted that he was still dedicated to the concept of the name filter, and the fans that are so dedicated to EverQuest.  He did a fantastic job of reassuring me.  I caught a bit of that old fire from his e-mails.
<br><br>
So I want to thank Steve for helping me with that small crisis of faith.  And I want to thank the whole EQ community, for making sure that all sides have their say, for speaking their minds throughout the beta.  Even if those minds don't think like mine, it's very important that RedEye Interactive hears what all of us think.
<br><br>
Hopefully next week I can go back to that silly rambling editorial style that keeps me out of the spotlight.  After all, we should be starting a new game, Werewolf the Apocalypse.  It's an extension of our long running Vampire game, and I'm expecting it to be a blast.  After all, the Lupine are the good guys.  Now, all I have to do this week is decide; Get of Fenris, or Glasswalker...
